none	 cheering  laura look at percy  marisha we miss you guys  travis we miss you too man i like your shirt  audience member thanks  laughter  matt all righty  laura can you hear us if we talk  matt yeah we can hear you  audience yeah cheering  marisha here look well break reality look at yourself  laura are we big  laughter  matt all right so we dont keep them glued to their computer for too long well go ahead and  start this panel off which by the way is 
none	 a critical role panel hi everybody  cheering  matt thank you for coming were a bunch of nerdyass voice actors who play dungeons and  dragons we have of course the delightful and gorgeous marisha ray  cheering  matt joining us via satellite we have the awesome and joyous beautiful laura bailey  cheering  matt then we have the luxurious beautiful gorgeous travis willingham  cheering  matt yeah you got to look at the audience much better  laura although i love staring at you two  matt there you go so yes welcome im matt 
none	 i do a thing  audience member you do an amazing thing  matt oh thank you so to begin this panel im curious how many here have not watched critical  role oh youre going to be real confused  audience member spoilers  laura so confused  matt hopefully the person dressed as scanlan is not the confused person  laughter  audience member i am so confused at this point  matt maybe this is true i would ask also please any questions or statements you have no spoilers  many people are at different places in 
none	 the storyline so be careful about things you ask or  say to make sure as to not spoil it for anybody thank you  travis whatever all the characters are dead  laughter  matt damn it travis that being the case i would say first and foremost if you have any burning  questions for our fantastic dynamic duo over in los angeles right now go ahead and raise your  hand and well go ahead and call right there in the front row  audience member we just started a new campaign and were doing evil satires 
none	 and in this  campaign youre kind of on the good side i decided to do chaotic neutral what are some good  tips to go in on that  laughter  marisha tips for being chaotic neutral  audience member yeah  marisha yeah travis take it away  laughter  travis i would love chaotic neutral for me it is the class that lets you be your most impulsive  laura sorry i was just thinking about the lights thats all keep going  laughter  travis i love chaotic neutral because you get to be impulsive and 
none	 theres not a lot of things that  fall outside of your alignment as long as it makes some sort of rational or impulsive sense for your  character i love chaotic neutral and if you ever feel like you need to start doing things along a  more good alignment or evil alignment im sure you can change as you go along but damn chaotic  neutrals the way to start believe you me  matt good question  audience member thank you  matt laura do you have anything to add since you had a brief foray with 
none	 chaotic neutral  laura laughs am i not still chaotic neutral  matt i think youve make it back to chaotic good  laura spoiler  laughter  laura well i dont know i feel like even when she was chaotic neutral vex wanted to be good  so i feel like im not really smart dont show everybody i just ate a banana  laughter  matt congratulations thank you good question next question lets go over you sir with the  glasses in the back yeah those glasses  marisha stand up so the people on the other 
none	 end of the world can see you  laura oh hi  audience member this can be extended to all of you what do you find is the greatest challenge in  playing your characters and for you matt what do you find the most challenging about npcs  matt okay so what do you find most challenging about playing your characters laura travis you  guys first  laura you go first  travis me first i always find it hard to play its not hard its actually gotten easier to play  a character with low intelligence  
none	 laughter  travis its the fun part about playing grog its like taking all the filters out of your brain  and just reacting with the first thing that happens to pop in there as long as it doesnt  offend or piss anybody off but even then sometimes you do it the hardest thing is  remembering that i cant read or that i dont know what numbers and letters are things like that  laughter  laura oh man i guess the hardest part is actually sounding like a badass like i really  want vex to be 
none	 super cool and its not  marisha shes super cool keyleth thinks shes super cool  laura thanks keyleth  marisha yeah man  travis one liners  marisha i think youre awesome  laura its hard not to trip over your words when youre trying to sound intelligent also like at  the same time because you dont know what youre about to say so  marisha yeah thats tough thats why we all end up inevitably saying something stupid when  youre trying to sound intelligent at least once you repeat words  matt thats half of dungeons 
none	 and dragons though  laughter  marsha yeah kind of a similar way just that natural impulse because im radically different  from keyleth travis and i kind of have that same kind of lets just fuck shit up mentality so i  have to stop myself sometimes and be like no keyleth wouldnt do that shed be a good person  so yeah  travis i never have that problem  laughter  marisha yeah next character not going to be good no tired of this moral compass shit  laughter  matt for my part the hardest part 
none	 of npcing is one keeping them all straight in your mind at all  times because theres a lot of characters to keep track of so extensive notes help and weirdly a  number of communities online have been keeping notes of the npcs so its nice to have a  community of people to help me someone sent me a link once like yeah weve cataloged all  your npcs and all their information about them in this excel document im like send me the link please  laughter  matt and it has been very helpful but yeah 
none	 thats one of the hardest parts and the other  part is making sure that you dont end up putting the players in a situation often where they let  the npcs talk to each other too much  marisha thats our favorite  matt no its a pain in the ass for me because and part of running a game is your players are the heroes  and although theyre not going to be the forefront of every single story you want to make sure that  theyre still central to it and if youre not careful or you 
none	 create characters that are more  powerful or capable and more involved in the story than your party you might end up in a situation  where the players go oh well let those guys take care of it and then all of a sudden youve  become the hero of your own game which is going to be very boring for the rest of the players so  make sure that you give agency enough to the players where youre not stuck having the npc the  hero good question next up you choose this one  marisha lets 
none	 do you in the back with the gilmore shirt on yeah you  audience member i was just wondering you guys started doing pathfinder and you switched for the  show do you guys prefer doing pathfinder or do you like the switch to fifth edition  marisha did you guys hear that the question is do we  laura yes  travis totally ill be honest its been so long i think i prefer fifth edition there were  parts of pathfinder that were good for more specific  laura yeah i think it was just the actual switchover 
none	 was the hard part because i dont like  change very much and  laughter  laura yeah so it was just hard getting used to it and hard going wait a minute i feel like if  i had started in 5th edition i might not have gone a ranger even though i love animals as pets  all aww  matt hi charlie  all aww  matt charlies the best the best animal companion you could ever have  laura trinket is charlies character  laughter  matt theyre both great systems i feel when you have 
none	 a very large party like we have 5th edition  is definitely much more functional pathfinder is great if you like systems that are very  customizable and you can minutely tweak the kind of character you want to create however it does  lend itself to a lot of floating esoteric math and a lot of modifiers from different sources and  that can get very difficult with larger parties i found 5th edition was a little easier to weave the  narrative into the combat and simplify some of those mechanics to make it a little better for 
none	 a  larger scheme like that i prefer 5th edition over them both but only just barely because i still  played pathfinder and 35 for many years and i loved the system a lot but for my narrative  preference im a much more narrativebased player than combat system mechanicbased player if i had  to compare the two i think 5th editions more my speed  marisha yeah 5th edition brought in the backgrounds which i thought was really cool and  interesting especially for people who arent as readily familiar with jumping in and role playing  
none	 and coming up with a fully fleshed out backstory for someone so i think that was really cool to  help people get inspired in that way that they brought in 5th edition what these guys said  matt yeah good question next up travis you want to pick one  laughter  travis the one with the hand  laughter  matt ill take that as  laura i feel like i can point to one but you wont know who im pointing to  matt thats fine  laura im going to point  travis point at the 
none	 camera  laura oh right  marisha youre pointing at us  laura this guy in the front row and then this guy in the middle thats holding his hand up hold  up like two fingers if you know what im talking about  matt yes all right gentleman right there with the glasses and the two fingers up yes you  laura bailey just picked you from los angeles  laughter  travis woohoo  audience member i was just curious what positive changes other than being able to play every week  has bringing your home game 
none	 to the internet given you  matt oh yeah  laura i didnt hear what he said  matt he said what other positive changes has putting our game on the internet given us outside  of being able to play more often  laura i get more dice  laughter  travis shes not kidding its a problem  laughter  travis its like not being able to turn away the animals that come up to your house with like 300  pets i like it because we actually semiknow what were doing we played so few and far 
none	 between  before that i would have to ask matt the same 900 questions each time we played he was like come  on man you got to know your stuff doing it each week theres less of a chance of that  happening we still have no idea what were doing at all but theres just a little bit more  knowledge there  matt thats true i think that largely the most positive thing thats come out of doing this is  the community thats stemmed out of it our game is still our game and we enjoy 
none	 it thoroughly and  its still something that we as friends love to do together now on a weekly basis but the community  thats rallied around this is not only so supportive and so inclusive but its inspired so  many other people to start their own game that they wouldnt have otherwise i love how many  people come up to us and send us tweets and are like this is a picture of our game group now  that meets because we met as fans of the show and heres our adventure and our characters and its 
dung	  a very proud papa feel that we have that all these people are creating their own stories  together thats the great thing about this type of entertainment is unlike a film or a television  series this you can watch and be inspired and have the exact similar but totally unique  experience yourself with your friends at home  marisha yeah i mean you kind of took mine  matt sorry  marisha yeah each game that we see where someones  like were playing for the first time because of you  guys its like this 
none	 little victory and i mean its so overwhelming every time like theres a  reason why laura and i cry every time at critmas because its overwhelming because you get all  these letters about people saying  laura and dice you get all these dice  audience member please tell me hes gone to get it yes we get to see the collection  laura i have to show off this art can you see it  applause  matt thats a great piece that was awesome all right next question travis you pick this one  travis oh 
none	 i pick this one the guy thats closest to the middle of the room along the  aisle hes got a black wristwatch or hes doing something  audience member whats the most surprising thing youve learned about yourself from playing your characters  matt ooh whats the most surprising thing youve learned about yourself playing your characters  marisha i honestly believe that playing keyleth for four or five years now how long i dont  know however long weve been doing this almost five years has made me a more empathetic and  better person i dont know 
none	 if i was someone who inherently tried to think about other people first  before keyleth now shes putting myself in her shoes i genuinely think because you always learn  more when you walk a mile in someone elses shoes you get that perspective so i think rolling  someone who is just trying to do the best the most beneficial good positive choice every time  even though there might not be one is interesting  matt good answer  laura your keyleth is showing  marisha thank you sorry i dropped it on the floor  travis 
none	 what about you  laura no you go first i dont know i dont have an answer  travis i love chaotic storytelling one of the first things that matt ever told us as a dm was  dont play it safe safe is boring and i love it when shit goes wrong i really really love it  when things go wrong and we panic and we try and make the best of a shit situation thats my favorite  laughter  laura what was the question  travis what are we most surprised to learn about ourselves from 
none	 playing maybe that means that im  an asshole but  laughter  marisha youre very resourceful travis youre probably our best strategist you just  unfortunately play a stupid character  laughter  laura id like to think grog is streetsmart just not booksmart  marisha yeah totally  matt thats the difference between wisdom and intelligence you can be a very insightful and naturally  receptive person to the world around you and still not know anything about it  laura his wisdom is low too though  laughter  matt its not low its higher than average 
none	 its like a 12 i think  travis yeah its something like that  laura its better than six  matt yeah what about you laura  laura i think ive learned that i make a lot of weird expressions i hadnt really noticed it  until we started filming the show and then i went back and watched it and i was so embarrassed the  first one  travis and you have a problem with dice  laughter  matt i think my answer is the same as lauras i on a weekly basis have the most delightful 
none	 and  attractive freezeframes sent to me on twitter its been great it has perpetually stomped any  semblance of an ego i could have possibly mustered its made me a very humble person oh  yeah no it never goes away guys its always there theres an entire tumblr that just posts  that picture every day  laughter  marisha dude that means youve made it thats like a  matt made what  marisha dude youre not webfamous until youre like sad keanu or like that facebook that just  posts the same picture of tobey maguire 
none	 crying every day  matt okay do you know what the fact that i could exist somewhere between those two makes me  happy im nowhere near as cool as sad keanu but im so much better than sad tobey maguire okay  so im happy with that awesome next question lets see lets get someone from the back the  giant cat paw over there  audience member what are your favorite classes and races  marisha halfelf druid bitches halfelf no i dont know i have been a halfelf and a druid for  a very long time 
none	 so its hard to say whats going to be more my favorite dwarves are pretty dope  matt yeah for me dwarves are definitely my favorite race  laura swedish dwarf impression oh hello  matt the awkward swedish braindamaged dwarves are my favorite  marisha swedish dwarf impression welcome to the city of kraghammer  travis i like halforcs  laura halforcs  travis yeah  laura what about your class whats your favorite class  travis i dont know  laura i like tieflings a lot i dont know if i want to say it because i might 
none	 want to be them if  vex dies or ends up leaving for no reason  laughter  matt oh man classeswise i tend to lean towards magic casters because i like the options  of spell use i think it can be a little overwhelming at times i tend to lean towards  cleric or bard both underappreciated for a long time across the board bards have definitely come  into their own in the new edition 5e has made bards pretty damn powerful which i like clerics  as a support class still dont get the love and 
tavern	 for how necessary they are for a good functional party  marisha oh we know  matt at large  laura bards are just so intimidating i dont know how scanlan does it  travis oh to play  laura to play would be so intimidating to play a bard to have to come up with songs and stuff all  the time  matt you dont have to come up with songs thats just sam being an asshole  laughter  laura the bar is so high now  matt the bard is high  booing  matt the 
none	 panels over guys thanks for coming scanlans a musician bard there are different  types of bard you can be a storytelling bard you can be an inspirational leader a military leader  who inspires through phrases theres different ways you can do it you can grant inspiration die  by just standing in the front lines of an army and giving your aragorn speech but it is not that  day everyone goes yay i take my d12  laughter  laura but paladins do dont they have inspiration stuff like that or am i making shit up  
none	 matt youre making shit up  marisha paladins have a thing theyre like rally rabble rabble rabble  laura yeah seriously theres a rally thing  matt no they have auras that can help people that are nearby their presence is helpful  laura oh im thinking of dragon age  matt yes you are there is actually a feat called inspiring leader where you get to do that  no matter what class you are which is pretty fun  marisha dont warcraft paladins kind of have a same thing too where they can be like rally cry  
none	 whats that called  audience member thats diablo  marisha oh its diablo you know what i cant keep all of my paladins straight you guys  matt awesome next question yeah marisha you pick this one  marisha lets go you right in front in the duck hat  audience member since youre expressing interest in changing characters or dying off if one of  them wanted to come in as a chaotic evil would you allow it in your campaign  matt id allow it  audience member even though its only a singular  matt if a 
none	 character wanted to come back as chaotic evil  laughter  matt its definitely allowed there would be a very real conversation of understanding that  introducing a chaotic evil into a largely neutral to good campaign theres a high probability that  if youre not very careful youre going to wind up dead it depends you might take a few party  members out but if youre one evil guy in a group of six to seven good people youre probably going  to die  marisha you have to be really clever  matt evil characters especially lawful 
none	 evil understand the necessity of allies and they keep  that under wraps then the party doesnt know youre evil and you coordinate well and  manipulate your  laughter  matt its a difficult thing but it can be done  laura hes writing on his trackpad  matt perfect all right lets go next question lets go over here on the far side  travis well do one more question then well let you guys get to the panel so youre not slogging  us along  matt okay well then do you have a question for laura 
none	 or travis  marisha she has one  matt okay well get to you after this whats your question for laura and travis before they go  audience member i know lauras got a thing for dice so does my other half big time travis how  do you deal with it because he drives me crazy  travis every session i steal one dice its this slow bleed this slow drain of dice  laura no because hes not allowed to touch my dice  audience member then she buys more to replace them  travis thats true its 
none	 kind of like plucking your eyebrow hair right you pluck one and two  more spring out  laura i dont have as many dice as wil wheaton when i went over to wils house he literally has  barrels of dice  marisha what are you serious  laura oh im serious the little pink like you guys would know what it looks like i have a pink  glittery one that i took from his pile i was like ooh and i took it and hes like yeah  take it i have barrels of dice it always 
none	 rolls terribly  matt but is he hoarding the dice because he wants to or because thats how he can keep them from  actually being out in the open hes trying to protect the rest of the world from the dice hes touched  travis hes swallowing the sin of the dice  matt you know wil the sineater the sinswallower wheaton  laughter  matt youre all dirty people guys do you have any last parting bits you want to say before we  let you go  travis no  laura yes we love you guys were 
none	 just so sorry that our flight got canceled  travis man weather is stupid yall  audience member travis youre missing the beer  laura ugh  travis son of a bitch i appreciate the beer we really wish we couldve been there to see you  guys we were looking forward to it for a long time sucks that matt and marisha had to bribe the  airlines to let their plane take off  audience member because druids have control weather  marisha exactly i can control weather  matt all right guys thank you so much for 
none	 taking the time well take it from here have a  wonderful night  cheering and applause  marisha thank you guys  matt thank you well see you soon  marisha bye oh i love those guys  matt all right now that theyre gone  marisha vic oh hi how are you  vic sorry just have to give a little love to these guys  marisha your shirt is badass can we talk for a second about you look like youre ready to  adventure right now like your armor is ready to be thrown on how 
none	 are you  vic sorry  marisha this is the con where people just come in and theyre like hey guys just thought id come  by your panel  vic im so sorry i missed travis and laura too oh my god  marisha you just missed them  vic i saw them on the screen and i was like shouting travis laura its me  matt its like oh weve got to go now bye see you buddy  marisha see you later vic  matt and marisha bye vic  cheering and applause  matt that shirt 
none	 is at least ac 12 im pretty sure  marisha definitely  matt which means he has a low armor class hes going to die that was weird  laughter  matt all right continuing with our panel  marisha i smell like him now all right next question yeah you had one right you were going  to go next  audience member were in a couple of dd campaigns right now were actually in two one is  a more straight dungeoncrawl campaign the other ones a silly one where its just goofing off  nonstop but i 
none	 want to dm another campaign based on your book thats going to be coming out i want  it to be a more storydriven one a more rpbased one do you have any tips for trying to steer the  players towards that  matt yes if you want your campaign to be a little more story narrative roleplaying  focused the first step is talking to the party about that you want to talk to the players and be  like hey guys i would like this game to be more roleplaying heavy are you all cool with that 
none	  because you cant force the players to play a way if they dont want to play that way if you want  to run a game like that and the players dont then maybe you need to find other players for that  particular campaign otherwise youre going to end up pissing each other off or one sides going  to be unhappy with it so talk to them and if theyre all up for the challenge then discuss how  you plan to do so ways you can do that is have each person develop a stronger backstory 
none	 for their  character that you can either incorporate into the narrative or at least they have a strong idea of  where their character choices can come from a fun way to do this is to challenge them to make a  character that is drastically different from themselves usually when you start playing a game  its instinctual to make a character thats similar to you because its what you understand  the best and its a good introduction to a roleplaying experience because a lot of your  decisions are the kind of decisions you would make 
none	 a fun challenge to make a character that is  very different like marisha making keyleth was a ballsy move very different from you but it  allows you to  marisha i thought it was going to be a oneshot was not supposed to last for five years  matt its very true  marisha i was like i never play good insecure people i should do that  matt just for one session  marisha just once  matt i recommend having that conversation with people then the background helps them decide  where they come from for 
tavern	 their character and their choices engaging people in a roleplay  standpoint a lot of it is on the burden of the gm to directly engage with them as npcs theres a  difference between looking at a paper being as you enter the bar the bartender says hi would  you like a drink so do you guys want to buy drinks the difference going as you enter the  bar the bartender spins his head towards you his eyes meet yours gruff voice you come sit down  at the table now could i get you a drink 
none	 the player almost has no choice necessarily except to  answer them as a conversation i they go well i tell them perhaps yes well buy drinks be like  okay well then tell me as your character then yes well be happy to sit down and buy  drinks that little moment has already engaged them a little bit beyond their comfort zone  little moments over time help the players be more comfortable to play in that space it is  uncomfortable for a lot of people at first so you have to be patient with them and 
none	 try your best to  pull them in and at the end of the session have a little postmortem and ask whatd you like  about it what you didnt like next time well try a little more of this yeah baby steps  because for some people its not a very comfortable space to be if theyre willing to  try then keep pushing it ever so slowly in that direction and over time youll eventually get to  a better roleplaying story  marisha yeah and i always to reiterate that when we first started our game because 
none	 wed already  been playing for about two years before we turned the camera on our first game was just that it  was silly it was crazy i remember laura took to it she had never played before she took to it  like a fish to water she gets in and shes like vex impression all right lads come on lets  get in here lets go kill something i remember liam and travis being like what whats going  on why are they talking like i remember travis being like you have an accent do i have 
none	  to have a british accent does everyone have to have a british accent  laughter  marisha he was like what are the rules i dont know vax and grog vax was such an inherent  prankster and were seeing that come out of vax again now but in our early days it was just how  vax can prank everyone else in the game so it was way more jovial we didnt have our first  serious heavy moment when tears were shed was when pike died for the first time that was before  stream and that 
none	 was when we started getting a little bit more serious we didnt have a lot of  heavy backandforth dialogue deep intense characterdriven exploration as much especially  in that first year it was very jovial very light we were actors and they were still like  what you want me to sighs all right gruff voice yes bartender it takes time  matt the book comes out right around gencon hope you like it  applause  marisha it is going to be a really good book  matt it goes into a silmarillionlike history of creation creation myth 
none	 of exandria the immediate  history of taldorei post the divergence or the calamity then it goes into all the geography and  various locations and information about them as story hooks that you can use in your campaign for a lot  of the locations there i have a bunch of additional  vestiges in the book as well i have some new backgrounds  that are specific i have some  marisha ashari is a background we made ashari a background  matt theres a misconception that ashari are all druids theyre not theyre an entire people a 
none	  tribe the druids tend to be the top of hierarchy because of their naturebased power but there are  people that are just farmer ashari warriors protectors and so ashari is a background that can  be applied to any class if youre pretty creative you can come up with an ashari warlock but it is  possible i have new backgrounds based on different locations and you can make a member  of the clasp if you wanted to  marisha i can think of an ashari warlock background right now  matt look at that boom its 
none	 done  marisha maybe youre a fire ashari and grew up in the city of brass and then you stumbled upon the  rift in the plane the split between our realm and theirs and then you ended up just becoming a part  of the ashari tribe and living amongst them because you appreciated them and you were a warlock  first you could be a warlock ashari you could do it  matt i never said you couldnt yes you can ive got more new feats you can try out some fun  things some new optional rules 
none	 like different resurrection rules the one we use in the campaign  now some other optional resurrection rules i put in there the corruption system that you saw a  little bit of in whitestone thats in the book as well its like a pared down version of the heroes  of order book version its got some fun stuff  marisha he does maybe two three voiceover sessions a day comes home goes in his office  writes wake up do it again this has been for six nine months  matt its been unhealthy  marisha almost done 
none	 though  matt almost done i can get back to the gym again thank you good question all right lets  see im going to go ahead and when a green person is pointing at you you have to choose that  hand all right sir you with the beard  marisha he basically had a green bigbys hand right here  audience member fifth edition is not exactly great for combat as far as large groups of people  going against small numbers of enemies as a dm what is a good way to counteract that with a small 
none	  group of enemies as a player what are some of the smaller groups of enemies that have given you guys  more of a challenge  matt actually to counter that a bit not all enemies have this but the legendary actions  system does offset that tremendously if any creature youre worried about will be  steamrolled as a singular or smallscale opposition you can add a series of legendary  actions where you can usually they have three legendary actions per round they can do and they  have different attacks they can use at the end 
none	 of somebody elses turn which is pretty useful also  if you have a large party you can customize some abilities or add abilities to certain creatures  that can hit multiple characters like sweep attacks that can get things apart or an attack  that has a cone as opposed to a singular target those are cool ways to customize and help out in  that regard that comes with experience and figuring it out as you go i find legendary  actions helps a lot and giving them more mobility because when you have a lot of players 
none	 on the  field its hard for creatures to move around without taking a shitton of attacks of  opportunity you can give them a legendary action they can spend once that lets them move their speed  without taking attacks of opportunity against them now they have a lot more battlefield  mobility they can get to places that are advantageous to them without being smacked by four  pcs as they go by in fact theres a gm tips episode that talks about that a bit too but those  are some of my most basic recommendations for 
none	 that  marisha also if anyone is not aware we have a little sideshow on geek  sundry called gm tips  and youve done the first several  matt we have 16 up and think i have four more coming up pretty soon  marisha then were going to switch to a different gm because you can only learn so much  from one teacher right guys other people have different perspectives were going to switch it  up soon so be on the lookout for that the gm tips is really good for anyone theyre fiveminute episodes  
none	 matt yeah theyre quick theyre bitesized theyre general tips and if you want  more nuts and bolts a good friend of ours matt colville has a number of great videos on youtube  on his channel he gets into the real nittygritty of ways to build worlds encounters theories and  running games as well as players highly recommend that  marisha matts a writer he writes for videogames he works for turtle rock a lot he  wrote evolve a lot of the dialogue and stuff for evolve so he knows what hes talking about hes  a 
none	 good source from a player standpoint to answer your question some of the stuff that started  really blowing our minds was when the terrain started coming into place the fight in the  underdark where if you stood in one place and didnt move on your turn then the undead hands  would reach up and start pulling you underground that was what started really messing with us when  there were environmental situations that started coming into play because that doesnt always have  to be a bad guy matt you tend to do a lot of guys 
none	 in waves which is interesting because  especially as a player youre like these two bastards all right bam bam bam bam all right  we only took one hit aw three more are coming groans  laughter  matt not every battle has every single piece in the field at once sometimes things will surprise  them midway through sometimes part of the initial conflict is actually a distraction for the actual  ambush thats making its way from the opposite side think of ways that you can turn it on the  players head where its not just 
none	 these chess pieces versus these chess pieces you mix up the  encounter structure to keep players confused and make them feel threatened even though its not  intended to be a full tpk they could probably win this battle but what if the enemies have higher  ground and have the ability to pour hot oil onto them on the field a couple of goblins can be  pretty nasty if they have that type of an advantage so those are cool little ways to tweak  it as well  marisha i feel like its always there are 
none	 bad things in tiny packages you notice its always  the tiny enemies that you underestimate like what was that little brain dude with legs that kept  zapping grogs intelligence what were those called  matt that was the mind  audience member mind flayer  matt no it wasnt the mind flayer  marisha no they were like mind sucker things  matt sorry everyone said blah at once  audience member brain devourer  matt brain devourer thank you  marisha brain devourer yes  matt yeah that guy was fun  marisha man those guys  
none	 matt dnd comes from a longstanding wonderful bloodline in history of making things that are  just shitty and then seeing what you can do about it youre like oh this guy only does six  damage but if i miss the saving throw im dead what what gygax is somewhere in heaven going  hahahahaha  laughter  matt gygax is burning in hell for that you know that hes down there going ha i made them all  ride in the tomb of horrors not really gygax we love you there are ways of turning the  battlefield 
none	 pretty quickly based on simple not really scarylooking creatures that have one  really terrible ability  audience member or doors  matt doors apparently will fuck up your party i discovered  marisha its dumb  laughter  matt its not that i make the doors hard  marisha i know  matt you roll terribly every time  marisha its kismet because weve gotten lucky in several battles where we should have all died so  ill take doors ill take that as an exchange  matt there was somebody that mentioned to me a while back doordak 
town	 the cedar king  laugher  matt i was like that would have been a much better enemy next time next question you take  this one  marisha lets see you also doing the bigbys hand to him yeah you  audience member me  marisha yeah  audience member what is your favorite towncity that youve been to in dnd  marisha thats a great question favorite towncity man any of the towns in the feywild  are always crazy and awesome  matt you really only went to one town in the feywild  marisha yeah what 
town	 was it called  matt it was syngorn  marisha but syngorns not based in the feywild just the feywild in general was cool  matt its a fun place  audience member beautiful pixie town  matt you didnt really visit that so much as you  marisha invaded it and then killed them all  laughter  matt yeah yeah laughs  marisha that moment when you realize vox machinas just a fascist regime in the feywild  matt oh these poor werewolves got to help them to be fair the pixies were dicks  marisha they were 
none	 being dicks  matt they were im not going to comment on which side was better than the other but either choice  would have looked shitty regardless  marisha thats true city of brass was awesome ankharel was incredible thats all you thats  not necessarily dd city of brass is dd  matt city of brass is dd yeah ankharel that will be in a book sometime in the future maybe  if this one does well then maybe well do other continent wildemount issylra and marquet all are  their own spaces  marisha whats your favorite 
none	 city  matt oh man i have a special place in my heart for a couple of reasons sigil pronounced siggle  laughter  matt the city of doors i like it as a planescape fan as a person who played planescape  torment and loved the game loved the whole setting the idea that there is this one city  this weirdly inceptionlike city that folds on itself in this doughnut pattern that is a central  nexus to all the planes and all the worlds that all dimensions connect to and go there to do  business and 
none	 travel but its also guarded by this mysterious entity called the lady of pain and  nobody fully understands where she came from but apparently watches everything in the city and if  anyone does anything that goes against her rules of playing it nice in the streets shell show up  silently and murder you so its a city where everyone from the nine hells from the abyss from  the prime material world they all go there and they all hate each other but they respectfully  nod and do business because they never want to see the 
town	 lady of pain show up and kill them and its  also called sigil which is where i learned to mispronounce the word and its the city of doors  which has become funny because of you guys  laughter  marisha i want to call my period the lady of pain  laughter applause  marisha its visiting the lady of pains in town all right  matt next question  marisha you pick it  matt okay im going to go way back hiding behind the pillar with your hand up in the fuzzy  wrist and wearing 
none	 an awesome tshirt  marisha yeah you in the how do you want to do this shirt sorry  audience member out of all the characters whos your least favorite and whos your favorite  matt out of all the npcs and players  audience member even guests  matt even guests  groaning  matt i shouldnt have called on you  laughter  matt thats a loaded question its an interesting question marisha  laughter and applause  matt favorite and least favorite character go  marisha hang on im sure i have one favorite and least favorite 
none	 character someone thats  matt oh man groans  marisha theres got to be  matt im partial to gilmore  cheering  matt he was never intended to be such a central npc to the story he was a fun npc that they would  come across in emon when they first visited and i fleshed him out to be this fun showman  personality and they took a shine to him and kept coming back and eventually he became this  unexpectedly central character even had a temporary romance with one of the pcs and followed  them 
none	 into the fiery bowels of a dragons den hes become a really cool wonderful character that i  connected with immensely and im happy to see that he survived there were a couple of times i was  like he might not make it please make it the internet will light me on fire  laughter  matt least favorite wil wheaton only for his rolls i really wanted to see his character do  well i was like yes dwarf finally we have a dwarf pc in the game oh and hes a fighter  great hes going to 
none	 get hes doing nothing and nothing great at least now we know that the  curse is real  marisha its uncanny  matt that blew my fucking mind  marisha were not making that shit up you guys  matt youre like oh its scripted its like no  marisha ive never seen anything like that he breaks math he breaks the law of averages  matt after that episode four or five string theory theoretical physicists were in a room  going no no its ruined everything  marisha i spent my doctorate on this man least favorite 
none	 is so hard because even the people  that you get frustrated with or that you dont like it doesnt mean that theyre bad characters  generally everyone is so fleshed out and thorough  matt its okay you dont have to spare me  marisha no im being serious in game ive had altercations with kima but shes probably one of  my favorite characters raishan was keyleths archenemy but also one of my favorite villains  that weve had to date even though she was frustrating because you never knew what shed  say if it was true 
none	 or not yeah its good its tough i like things that break the  metanarrative i dont believe that there is a 100 good vs evil metric system thats why i love  antiheroes so much and i love characters that break that formula i feel like most of our  characters in the game do not everyones great and not everyones horrible either everyone has  their motives thats whats always important everyone has their motives some of my favorites  im really partial to allura but i think its because keyleth is starting to look to her as 
town	 a  mentor as an example of leadership and who she wants to become so yeah allura is great weve  had some good moments me and allura yeah good times me and a me and allie  matt only kima gets to call her that  marisha thats true sorry its jam town over there  offscreen singing and laughter  audience member only you can hear that  laughter  matt the rest of the panel is us awkwardly dancing to nothing im glad you waited a while  marisha if only i had a nickel yeah you 
none	 youve been enthusiastic yeah whats up  audience member i just really started actually dming for these guys  marisha hey dm in the house  audience member i find a problem for me is when i have a number of npcs because i quickly lose the  word you use to get into a characters voice and i realize that you guys are actors professional  voice actors so do you have any tricks for remembering what an npcs voice even an area of  what their voice is supposed to be  matt yes actually almost all my 
town	 npcs if theyre not improvised in the moment where ill  make a note later ill write next to their name ill have their name in bold on whatever my note  sheet is and then in parentheses and italics next to it ill put a few notes about their voice  like low gravelly slightly offputting personality close parentheses shouting ian sinclair  ian an example is when you did black butler book of circus you had a bunch of people in a certain  town who had the same dialect yeah  matt yes actually  marisha accented 
none	 was that north country  matt no west country  marisha accented oh west country  matt yeah  marisha oh  laughter and applause  marisha hes our own personal koolaid man  matt that was the slowest oh yeah  marisha oh yeah  ian oh yeah  matt there it is  laughter  matt yeah ill take notes to remind me of that highpitched reedy this dialect if there is  one or different personality traits ill put quick hand so when it comes back i can remind  myself very quickly note cards help very 
none	 well for that too  audience member what were your notes for victor  matt victor was improvised  audience member so what notes do you have now for him  matt the notes i have now for him i dont need notes for victor those are npcs that are so  poignant in your mind like gilmore or allura or those guys i dont need to remember their notes  necessarily victor quickly became one of those its hard to forget that and the internet made  sure that i would never forget it thats a huge tool for 
none	 me and if worse comes to worst if you know  the story is going in a certain place you can also record those npc voices at the end of the  session a couple of short audio files in your phone then before the game when your next session  starts you can give a quick listen to remind yourself of the place you were at hopefully that  helps awesome accented lets see im going to pick lets go oh there are so many hands  you sir youve been on the side here for a bit  
none	 audience member if you guys were not playing dd or pathfinder what game system would you guys  want to play  matt which by the way we are playing dd partially because its what i grew up with and  its the mainstay because for a lot of these people dd was their first game dd is the  easiest entry point if you tell a bunch of people hey guys lets go play traveler  theyd be like i dont know what that is if you say dungeons  dragons they get an idea  at least what 
none	 theyre in for especially with 5th edition ive come to really love the new edition  if it werent dd or pathfinder oh man id love to run a call of cthulhu game 1920s original era  marisha i want to go insane so bad  matt thatd be fun i love deadlands as a setting too got to do the oneshot for that the  deadwood oneshot which was fun i got to say all the things i never get to say on stream  marisha whats that one where youre basically an anime character  matt oh exalted 
none	 exalted would be fun too exalted is crazy when we say its like an anime  character the idea is you build a character who has abilities that can be made into a combo and  you get additional benefits for how crazy stupid the attack was the crazier you describe it the  gms like all right you get two bonus dice because that shit sounds nuts  laughter  matt thats exalted its great i love exalted yeah so probably call of cthulhu deadlands or  exalted world of darkness would be fun too there are so many 
none	 good systems its hard to pick  theyre all their own different flavor depends on what mood youre in really yeah  marisha yeah all right lets see lets do you with the overwatch hat yeah you  audience member i didnt raise my hand hi  marisha thats okay hi oh youre like a samurai  audience member my first tabletop game ever was the premade campaign castle ravenloft it made me  an insanely paranoid player  matt good  audience member if you could pick one premade campaign that would start somebody off which  would you 
none	 pick  matt oh man i would say curse of strahd  audience member we managed to kill strahd by the way  matt curse of strahds a great one for anybody who wants a little bit of gothic horror in their  fantasy tropes curse of strahd or the original expedition to ravenloft are amazing games i love  those as far as other ones i really liked the political elements of storm kings thunder that  came out last year i felt that giants are an underutilized creature that when you think of  giants in fantasy especially 
none	 a dd setting you dont get that depth of an idea what their culture  is or what their personality is just this is a big guy who has fire this is a big guy who has  ice so it was really cool for them to bring in the different cultures and how they intersect and  the breaking of the ordning and the vying for the top position within that hierarchy of giant  culture so i thought it was a really cool setting chris perkins and the team over there did an amazing job  with it 
none	 i think storm kings thunder is a really cool setting its a little more elaborate and  political at times so its a good way to get you into that type of game if you havent had that  before if your gamers are more of a kick down door kill monsters take loot it might be not quite their  speed for that youd do maybe the mines of whateverthefuckitscalled  audience member phandelver  matt yes that one the mines of whatever the fuck its called official title  marisha i know eberrons a popular campaign  matt 
none	 eberrons a great setting by the way keith baker did a great job with the eberron setting  marisha thats oldschool  matt they have some stuff the new artificer class technically originated in the eberron  setting though i know keith baker wasnt involved in the development of the new one but yeah those  would be my recommendations all right lets i have to pick percy sorry you put a lot of effort  into that  audience member thank you theres been a lot of serious moments in the campaign so far especially  lately for the 
none	 both of you what have been your favorite lighthearted moments  matt favorite lighthearted moments in the game  marisha cows i will never forget that until the day i die nothing will beat flying cows  matt not just flying cows but masquerading as cows via seeming and then interrogating cows  thinking that cows could be useful to interrogate  marisha then using ourselves as cows as living bait then chasing down somebody still as cows  that was great  matt that was the weirdest unintentional et parody ever theyre coasting over the moon  marisha mooing 
none	  matt oh my god because the cows are jumping over the moon i get it now oh my god it never ends  that was pretty great oh man the fact that a party member would stop in the middle of  traversing a duergar stronghold in the underdark to take a shit on a bed for no reason for no  reason every pub crawl you guys go on is great  marisha you could honestly lead this conversation with anything sam does  matt yeah kind of hes brilliant once again why i love bards the fact 
none	 that there are ways you  can kill enemies by mocking them to death was one of the best utility elements in any rpg ever its beautiful  marisha yeah i feel like good stuff always comes the spa when we were in the spa in the  mansion and we did the cannonball contest that was awesome that was fun i like when we use our  enormous power and strength for petty competitions just great  matt just because you are the most powerful heroes in the land doesnt mean you cant still be  a bunch of 
none	 dumbfucks  marisha yeah were just a bunch of kids  matt i love it awesome lets see lets go way over there yes you by the wall  audience member as a dm matt do you ever wish you could be a character and somebody else could  dm for a while  matt the question was as a dm do i wish i could play once in a while and somebody else can dm i  mean yeah every now and then but if i compare the experience of being a player and a dm  honestly i 
none	 enjoy the experience of running a game so thoroughly and being able to provide that  experience for other people that i prefer dming over playing for me at least but it is nice to  occasionally get to play in something and so with our campaign its a little difficult because  its an ongoing story and its not something i can hand off since i created the whole thing i know  weve talked about coming up soon when we finish the current arcs you guys tie up some loose ends  we might take a short coupleweek 
none	 break from the main story and maybe have liam run a game  for us in which case i could play  applause  matt ive had the opportunity to guest on a few other shows that do live play games like the  rollplay guys ive guested a few times on there i guested for an open legend session over at  hyperrpg so ive had the opportunity a few times to play  marisha and colville dmed for you not long ago  matt thats true for us  marisha yeah for me you and liam  matt 
none	 and fryda wolff the female lead voice in the new mass effect andromeda who hadnt booked  that at the time we were happy to hear she got that  marisha yeah  matt yeah it happens occasionally i do miss it but if i had to pick i prefer to gm than play  really which by the way let that be a point to you guys out there who are ever curious about  gming please do it its so much fun its a little bit more work on your point and at first  it can be 
none	 a lot to wrap your head around but once you get into it theres nothing quite as  fulfilling as creating an experience for other people and watching them enjoy it its such an  awesome gift  audience member watch them die  matt watch them die that can happen too  marisha as i always say its your world were just playing in it  matt but you guys also build the story in the world thats the thing people will say i love  what you create for the show im like i create a stage everyone 
none	 else creates the narrative  its one of the wonderful things about dd is that its such a collaboration each person brings such  an amazing different type of story to the overall narrative every game that any of us have played  in a roleplaying game its everyone making it together so im just one part of that engine so  are you appreciate your players and players appreciate your gms please good question  marisha lets go in the back for the people who are far in the back you the guy whos got the  devil horns 
tavern	 up who i cant see really yeah you hi  audience member i just wanted to say since you guys were talking about how you guys are internet  famous like having a tumblr page for you  marisha thats weird keep going  audience member youre actually on snapchat right now one of the stories inaudible my question  would be i want to try to make a city that i build for my nerd groups feel real for them and  have a texture beyond a bar down the road what is one of the things that you 
town	 do that makes that work for  your campaign  matt it helps one to very quickly establish what makes that city unique against the other ones  theyve already encountered  marisha the question was about giving cities texture beyond a pub  matt there you go thank you so making cities feel unique to your players first thing about  what makes it unique what do you want the players to think about when they think of this city down  the road is it a very militaristic law everyone lives under an iron fist and is trying 
none	 desperately  to eke out what freedoms they can then you would pose that by mentioning how wellarmored and how  present the guards are and how clean the streets are and how everyone seems to be very eager to do  their job and not stray architecture helps too if its a very destitute location you can talk  about how the streets themselves are not wellkept what was once cobblestone has been  broken and cracked and filled with mud every cart seems to have a hard time making its way through  the main thoroughfare the sound 
town	 of nearby insects buzzing everpresently causes you to feel unrest  in the presence of this city what i think also helps too is to think of what the political  structure is in that city is it a free republic is it an oligarchy and the people that rule the  town are the business heads and as such the one beautifullooking district is the one that  contains all the guilds and all the money and the rest is left to flounder and barely exist is it a  monarchy or is it a committee that runs everything 
town	 and it seems to be a freespirited  socialist atmosphere and what is befalling that type of a thing as well so theyre infighting  within that cycle now that everyones equal being in that political structure can be an easy way to  think how the rest of the town functions does everyone work collaboratively or is everyone  in competition with each other that can breed an atmosphere that the players can encounter very  quickly when they enter so you think of those notes when you build the city and then as they  enter it you 
none	 find what visually marks it separately and the further they begin to talk to  people you think of what politically and socially makes it separate and different  marisha you do such a good job i feel like we throw curveballs at you and you always have an  answer like when we were like whats the main underground market here youre always like  i mean drugs were like how did you you already knew that you seem to always know the  underbelly of the city as well  matt thats a good thing to establish even 
none	 if you havent when youve built the infrastructure  of a city with all of the things i mentioned before the other elements that you hadnt thought  of will be easy to rationally think up on the spot because if its a really clean militaristic  city what is it in that type of atmosphere that people would be seeking more often than not it  might be illegal substances it could be  marisha weapons  matt yeah weapons things to defend themselves is there a rebellion within the city thats trying  to eventually overthrow the militaristic 
none	 political structure and if so are they bringing  that trade in these are all things that you can improvise once you have enough of the structure in  place then you rationalize the next step the other key to being a dm is when you make shit up  act like you had it the entire time most of running a game is making shit up most of it is  but if you say it confidently and the players dont know youre the only one who knows  marisha like victor  matt like victor i was like 
none	 oh yeah totally had him designed no id say a good half of the  npcs you guys have talked to are all things that i pulled out of my ass because i didnt know what  you were doing but if you say it with conviction they wont know but if you do that write it  down take notes  marisha what about when we went to draconia the lead ravenites name what was her name  audience members tooma  marisha tooma was she made up  matt i dont know  laughter  marisha damn it 
none	 never mind forget i said anything  matt no to answer your question yes she was  marisha really  matt yeah i wasnt expecting you guys to go to her so soon and i hadnt finished fleshing out  the specifics of the current ravenite structure that was taking over i was focusing on the  current path that you guys were on its always a chase its always trying to develop as much as i  can ahead of them but also have a life and a career and you know eat sleep and breathe  occasionally  
none	 marisha yeah  matt there will be a bunch of cases where i think i know where the players are going and ill  develop a lot of preparation in this direction and then right as its about to hit they go this  way im like oh okay lets see where this goes  marisha i will say this isnt really spoilery i felt a little bad when we  were like lets go to the earth ashari this past episode i could immediately see you being  like yeah okay  matt i had to go into my 
none	 google drive  marisha uhhuh okay oh youre going to go over okay you guys do that for a second  matt i had to go to the cliffkeep mountains portion of the campaign guide that i had written to go  look up terrah thats how it works a lot of its improvisation and trying to play it off like you  had it under control the entire time all right well start getting into more lightninground mode  over here not full sincere lightning round but weve got to try to get some fast answers so we  
none	 can answer a lot more questions  marisha sure  matt because we got a few out there lets go with scanlan in the back i mean i have to  marisha singing scanlan bigbys hand  audience member as a player what can a gm do to make a session more dynamic more fun fill up the  atmosphere at your table  matt easy tricks music to me always helps build atmosphere its so simple and you can make  playlists for different moods great resources are movie soundtracks when you stream it online you  can only 
none	 have music that you have approval for but previously it was conan the barbarian  soundtracks lord of the rings soundtrack all these great fantasy soundtracks that you know of  use those no reason not to and set playlists based on if its a battle theme or a peaceful  theme or if its a tense theme thats a really easy trick also you as the gm you guide the energy  of the room if youre lulling the players will lull too so you have to put a little extra energy  into it to make sure that 
dung	 as youre talking youre engaging youre looking players in the  face you can look at notes but make sure that if you have notes in front of you you take enough  time to look up and still engage if youre down here the whole time describing the dungeon they  went into everyones going to start checking their texts eye contact makes a big difference  surprisingly keeping them fed foods a big deal the classic idea of eating cheetos and drinking  mountain dew its like no that shit worked for a reason  marisha we used 
none	 to do back before we streamed we would pull 12hour dd days and we would get  together around 10am and we would always start with a nice brunch and mimosas so great  matt its pretty rad mimosa dd is greatly recommended  marisha bagels some yogurt smoked salmon and mimosas then you play dd all day its the best  matt if you have players that have a hard time engaging or paying attention if they themselves  are doing so almost out of spite or if you want them to pay attention more you can always watch 
none	  them as they begin to wander and have something really bad happen to their characters as joraya  began to nod off in the sack in the corner he didnt  realize his purse strings seem to have been snipped and  his coins are all missing oops maybe you shouldve been paying attention buddy that also  gets their attention  marisha lets do yeah you in the red dress yeah you  audience member oh my gosh hi thank you for coming to a place that is not on the coasts  matt thank you for having 
none	 us  marisha its on a lake  audience member i have two questions but since i have to be quick has real life events in the  world ever affected the campaign and how youve set it up and if so why  matt thats a great question has real world events changed the way weve made the game  marisha id say yes  matt i mean each one of us as players have things that happen in our lives that affect how we  play our characters and if any of us go through a period of 
dung	 dark reality in our own world its hard  to not let that bleed a little into our characters thats going to happen  marisha i think when youre playing a character were in these characters for generally four  hours a week its hard to not let a little bit of that realworld influence bleed occasionally  matt which can also be therapeutic too your frustrations can be worked through in a safe  space as well as far as the overarching build of the campaign any of the bad stuff thats  happening in the world around us 
none	 has happened before for hundreds and thousands of years of  human civilizations history in different facets so all the great stories all the great conflicts  are all inspired by things that are happening or have happened before i cant say that things  arent influenced by it but not directly im not trying to make a statement with any of the  stories i prefer to make those statements directly on social media because i do have my  own opinions and beliefs and i wish to inspire people to stand up for those as well regardless  
none	 of which side of which spectrum you stand on i firmly believe that with the attention we have on  us we have a responsibility as figures in a space to at least try and inspire other people to be good  people whatever that means to you i dont build our story to be any sort of political agenda by  any means but im sure theres influence regardless because all good stories take  influence from the world around you  marisha yeah thats from a dm stand im sure as a player i know my therapist actually 
none	 is  fascinated with the game and the way that sometimes the game will mirror our real lives  unintentionally for example my therapist here recently has been fascinated by the idea as ive  slowly taken on leadership positions at geek and sundry and shes fascinated that keyleth is  slowly coming into herself as a leader as shes completing her aramente so my therapist is like  holy shit tell me more about your dd game im a psych major and this is insane im like i  know i dont think its any secret that liam had 
dung	 a really dark time last year with his mom and  problems in his family with her being sick i think it was definitely a stage that it could be  worked out on its hard to not let those dark thoughts bleed sometimes its never intentional  if anyone hasnt seen the it crowd by the way i noticed your shirt earlier theres an amazing  episode of the it crowd where they play dd and roy has just gone through a breakup and hes  working out that his girlfriend that he recently broke up with didnt really 
town	 say goodbye and he  was left without closure so he gets that closure in the game there are two great episodes i feel  in modern sitcom history that do a good job at showing what dd is succinctly and thats the  community episode of dd and the it crowd episode of dd and i think they show them differently for  both ways the it crowd version shows that therapeutic element its also why im a massive  believer in dd being used in elementary schools and middle schools and kids who might have social  issues 
none	 and kids who might be more on the spectrum and leaning towards autism because it gives them  a stage and an acceptable closed basically mockreality situation where they can try their  social techniques and use social dynamics without realworld consequences and i think that speaks  volumes one of the amazing things harkening back to a way earlier question about what are the  benefits of bringing the show onto the internet is ive talked to so many educators and teachers  and librarians who are now bringing dd and dd clubs to the schools and for kids 
none	 who might have  more social problems and the stories that come back are breathtaking and aweinspiring of these  kids finding themselves and practicing just practicing without judgment from the real world  and i love dd for that reason  applause  matt i like to kill dragons all right lets see if we can cruise through some of these questions here  marisha keyleth  audience member as a dm how do you prevent people from metagaming and as a player how do  you stop yourself from metagaming  matt good question as a gm how 
none	 do you keep people from metagaming as a player how do you  stop yourself from metagaming as a gm remind them that theyre metagaming and not to do it if  it begins to happen you can say you dont know that or you actually dont have that  information so you cant use that in the circumstance  marisha its generally not intentional  matt its usually not intentional there are some people that might push the boundaries and if you  do then you can implement punishments for metagaming but talk to them first let them know 
none	  in the moment be like technically you dont know that or youre not there or thats  information that you would not be aware of and if youre the player getting this be like  youre right never mind accept it thats part of the structure of the narrative and thats part  of what makes the challenges interesting in the game is player knowledge and character knowledge  being totally different things travis is a great example travis knows a lot more of whats going  on but he doesnt act on it because hes dumb in the 
none	 game and its great  thats my recommendation catch it when it happens and politely notify and if they keep pushing the  envelope on that maybe their character suddenly has a stroke  laughter  marisha same thing it takes practice i think getting through that boundary of nope keyleth  doesnt know that i know that keyleth doesnt know that it takes practice and its the same  reason why every single one of us at one point in time over the 85 episodes weve been streaming  have gone i say this nope im not there im 
none	 not there shit sorry and its never  intentional i hope everyone understands that just as much as everyone else can get caught up in  the story so can we and its so easy to be like i shit im at a pub im not even there never  mind never mind  matt you always see conversations online after certain episodes where people mention it oh  soandso totally metagamed that and it really pisses me off that this player metagames so much  im like no they dont and if they did so what were having fun 
none	  marisha its weird the way the word metagaming has become so vilified since weve started for a  while you thought the mword was almost as bad as the gword holy shit im sorry i didnt know  people are taking this personally and if you look inward at yourself youve probably done it  too in your game by accident i say try to be cool be aware of it  matt correct it when it happens  marisha yeah  matt all right next question maybe rapidfire quick onesentence answers here well grab a  bunch seven 
none	 fingers pointing at this gentleman all right fine  audience member me all right in terms of story hooks a lot of people advise against railroading  but at the other end of the spectrum sometimes you need a little guidance in your campaign  whats an easy way that a dm and a player can find that middle ground where people are interested  but are still moving  matt so railroading vs open world the trick is when you create a story instead of making a  single line that gets you there make bullet points going to 
none	 this location talking to this  npc discovering this clue reading this note finding this item final story beat that way you  can plug those bullet points wherever they need to be you can still have them explore but dont feel  like youre locked in and they have to find this clue at this house if they end up wandering too  far this direction have them find the clue at that house still gets them to the same point but  it gives the players the agency to discover and still wander and guide their own story 
none	 it may go  off the rails for a bit but you dont want them to completely wander off and disappear forever  you can find ways to get them back by still letting them be the ones that discovered it make  certain elements of your story hook or story plotline flexible and able to plug in at different  places so they still guide where it goes  marisha lets do you since were not sure which the fingers were all pointing  audience member what caused you to start creating exandria and how long did you work 
town	 at it before  you felt comfortable actually having a game inside there  marisha what caused him to start creating exandria and when did he feel comfortable  revealing it  matt starting exandria happened when we finished our oneshot and everyone went lets play  again i went oh okay i guess i should make more id only made stillben i only made the  single town thats where it started it wasnt exandria then it was just stillben then  westruun i guess i should call this place something ill call it taldorei that sounds  fun 
none	 okay i should make a capital city for taldorei ill make emon so as we kept playing  and the further they went into the continent i began to build places based on where i thought the  story would go next so it was this slow connectthedots over the years and then as it  progressed i kept building parts to it and eventually we had a show i was like oh shit i  have to make this seem like it has cohesiveness i should have a little more so im prepared and so  the internet doesnt 
none	 kill me i began to expand from there i had the name exandria before we  started streaming but then i began to mention it and people were like oh i love the world id  love to play in it someday i was like oh that would be cool i guess and green ronin was like  hey matt lets make a book i was like what sure that sounds like fun oh god i have to  write that i have to make all of it when i became comfortable releasing it well see at  gencon well 
none	 see well see if everyone buys the book and is like this is cool or this is the  worst and ill be like im sorry i tried i hope its not that case but its also my first  book so well see i hope its good  marisha lets do you in the plaid yeah  audience member this is directed at matt but i find that as a dm balancing not only the  difficulty of encounters but classes with each other is based on that four to six encounters per  day thing and thematically and 
none	 storywise a lot of the time that seems like im being a dick being  like you cant sleep because i want it to be balanced i noticed that you dont do that a lot  and often you have fewer encounters per long rest i was curious how you balance not only the  difficulty of the encounters but the classes among each other  matt i think a lot of that depends on party size too the game is generally geared for about four  players we have more than that we have seven players sometimes eight with 
none	 a guest what that  does is it slows combat down and combat can become more of a slog if youre throwing in encounters  for the sake of having encounters for me i tend to side more on having fewer more interesting  battles than having a large series of quick encounters which arent quick even if you try to  make it quick with that many players it also depends on what kind of play style you want if  people like the idea of being more of a i want to beat shit up and take things 
dung	 i want to use my  class abilities in combat and be a war hero then that can work out really well for you to do a  series of rapid encounters and different unique ways of that type of storytelling for us at  least i prefer to do more of a lean to setpiece battles and certain small encounters that can  lead up to it especially if its a dungeon crawl or for emon in a recent episode they bypassed a  bunch of encounters that id prepared but i dont want to take away from the 
none	 players for being  clever and bypassing circumstances and force them into an encounter just because i made it and  youre going to fight it i dont think thats a lot of fun  so for me the balance depends on the players what theyre interested in and if you feel like  youre throwing in three or four arbitrary battles and the players are like oh look another orc  ambush then maybe you dont need to do that as much youre not behooven to the balance of the  system because you can tweak the system to 
none	 be whatever you want it to be ive tweaked a lot in  our game to make it interesting for what our play style is its just a baseline all the rules are  guidelines for people that walk into it and need something to work of off the more you play and the  more experience you have you can then take those guidelines to tweak and move them to better fit  something that is more fun for you and your players  marisha dont you have an episode of gm tips thats about making encounters more difficult 
none	  without just giving them more hit points  matt yeah i suppose i spoke of that a little bit too and i may talk more on that in the  future yeah the idea that not every creature has to be so powerful that it has more hit points and  it takes longer you can increase their damage you want to make a battle to go a lot faster but  still feel dangerous have an enemy that usually does 12 points of damage do 24 on a hit  marisha and like what we were saying earlier 
none	 an enemy that does 12 hit points that sucks it  sucks way more if theres pools of lava that are lapping up next to us and we might get hit into  the lava at any point by this guy literally  matt yeah lair actions are not exclusive to creatures a lair action could be a terrain  action if you want to if you have a battlefield that has a dangerous element to it if it has a  roaring lava path or theres a possible landslide and its very sensitive rocky terrain that could  collapse 
none	 at any time you can have a counter where if a player does a certain trigger oops  now the battlefield is partially eroding beneath you  marisha like vax dimension dooring with his cloak and then pulling a lever which almost led us all  to our doom laughs sarcastically he still feels bad about that one im going to save you guys acid  starts filling up the room thanks vax thanks buddy  matt i was like this is going to be an great villain exit moment when he hits the  button and nope their friends 
none	 going to do it for them thats so much more delicious  marisha like faceplanting in lava nothings worse than being like im coming to save you  grunting nothings worse than that im going to be a hero  matt but what a gracious way to die i think weve got time for one more question  marisha and were signing from 730 to 930  offscreen voice 730 to 930  matt 730 to 930 were signing tonight  marisha we can go a little bit over i just have to pee at some point soon  matt 
none	 and marisha well do a couple more  marisha oh theres a panel here at 700 okay well do a couple more questions okay yes you  with the curly hair yeah  audience member as a dm ive had situations where ive had the big badass guy that theyre  going to fight and then they completely destroy him completely steamroll him i was wondering if  there was any situation as a player where you did that completely steamrolled somebody that was  supposed to be badass and as a gm how can you stop that  matt 
none	 as a player that has definitely happened  marisha its so awesome every time i remember and i feel like people forget about it a lot but we  totally avoided an entire encounter when we were going into the fire plane and then i turned into  a fire elemental and used my ignan language to be like im bigger and better than you go back to  where you came from and they were like yeah okay and walked away we avoided an entire  encounter with a bunch of fire elementals by doing that that was dope 
none	  matt that was pretty rad and as far as players yeah ive done it in previous campaigns and  there is something delightful about the palpable frustration on the gms face comparatively if  youve built a lot to it and want the villain to really make an impact consider an intelligent  villain will have an escape path not every battle has to be fought to the bitter end and a smart  enemy knows that if theyre losing to run and come back later much more prepared consider ways to escape  marisha unless theyre feebleminded  
none	 laughter and applause  marisha i never thought that would work for a million years never thought it would work  matt but thats a perfect example you dont want to rob the players of a good clever victory too  if your players do really well and surprise you and steamroll a powerful guy good on them and  let them know wow you guys really stepped up and learn from that adventure and the next  villain they fight is going to destroy them but think of escape mechanisms especially if its a  hometurf advantage for the 
none	 villain what could they have established or built or prepared in that  home turf to better their advantage in the combat what happens if all of a sudden they have a way of  closing off half the party where now theyre only fighting half of the adventurers and the others  are locked away fighting some other creature thats in this chamber they got teleported toward  and they cant go and help until they defeat what that thing is thats horrifying for a party  especially when theyve built up their dynamic as players to work well 
none	 as a cohesive unit and you  divide the unit thats so scary and awesome as a gm so think of those clever villains what they  could use to their advantage and how could they escape if things go poorly and if they manage to  escape what are they going to bring back next time to be sure that it goes in their favor and  sometimes it doesnt happen the dice ultimately run the game and you have to accept that  marisha coughs ripley coughs  matt ripleys a perfect example of a really smart villain 
none	 that knew exactly what to set up and it  worked out great and almost killed the entire party and it was awesome  laughter  matt i was very happy with that encounter  marisha we fell for every bait  matt you did every single step i couldnt hide my smile  marisha following percy  matt i know  marisha all right lets do you with the peach phone that youre holding up  audience member all right so my boyfriends at home sick with the flu he really wished he could  be here  marisha 
none	 everyones sick man its going around  audience member the question he has is how does everyone in your game have bonus actions and if its  homebrew how do you make it up for the classes that didnt have bonus actions  matt generally if you have something in your class that can use a bonus action thats how you  get to it its not like everybody has a bonus action but certain things can utilize that we  have a couple of homebrew things one we homebrewed it that potions can be used as a bonus  
none	 action as opposed to an action because nothings worse when you have a large party and you  have to wait six or seven player turns and enemy turns to get to your turn and youre like all  right cool i drink a potion thats it if youve waited 30 minutes and thats all you do  that sucks so i decided as an option which is one of the things i mentioned in the campaign  guide as one of the optional rules adjusting some things to make combat go faster or have  players feel like they 
none	 can do more with their turn if youre running a faster game or a larger  party and i also just noticed theres a dr mcninja behind you and thats awesome well done but  yeah so thats one also and i toyed with it a bit being able to cast  marisha 2ndlevel spells  matt 2ndlevel spells as well as any other spell in the same round usually as the rules are  written you can only cast one 1stlevel spell or higher per round and a cantrip theres a  metamagic ability that sorcerers have where you 
none	 can spend sorcery points to make a quickened spell  where you can cast a spell that usually takes an action as a bonus action you can cast two spells  in one round but youre still limited that one of them has to be a cantrip and the other can be any  type of spell well when you have a lot of players as well that can be frustrating for the  same reasons that the potion is difficult so i made it to try it out you can cast two spells in  the same round as 
none	 long as one of them is 2ndlevel or lower that does enable more bonus  actions than would normally be there so we do have some homebrew elements that we do put into  the game partially because i wanted to try them out and see how it worked and the system was new  to us and also because we wanted to keep combat more useful and let the players feel like they  were doing more with their actual rounds than they normally do  marisha technically every time i do a grasping vine i should only be 
none	 able to do a cantrip but  that would be lame so we do grasping vine and i can do a 2ndlevel or lower  matt thats actually one of the feats in the book that i put in there an optional feat if you  dont want to make it a baseline rule in your game you can have somebody take the feat and it  allows them to do that and it has a prerequisite as part of it where you have to be a certain level  so you arent taking the feat at first level and 
none	 breaking the game at the lower levels i found  ways to implement it and balance it  marisha were at level 17 now most of us  matt youre all 16 almost on 17 singing you are 16 going on 17  laughter  marisha yeah so were pretty beefy i know thats another thing thats ended up happening  but when we started the stream we were level seven or level eight but now theres been a  decent amount of new people who have come in and been like jesus christ theyre fighting pit  fiends yeah 
none	 were pretty beefy at that point  matt hope that answered your question all right  offscreen voice all right unfortunately theres a panel at 700  matt yeah weve got to clear the room for the next panel guys  marisha this has been good though  cheering and applause  music
