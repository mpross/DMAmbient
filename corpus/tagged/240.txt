none	 for tonights episode of critical role previously  vox machina the band of adventurers walking through taldorei postattack of the chroma  conclave an evil troupe of chromatic dragons that are currently holding power in this region and  beyond after tearing through many of the bastions of society in this countryside they have gone on  a quest to search for artifacts known as the vestiges of divergence from ancient wars and  heroes of old and yore to use against the leader of the chroma conclave thordak the cinder king  now as part of this confrontation they 
none	 made their way to the city of westruun which was partially  destroyed by the black dragon umbrasyl while it was off and away with the rest of the conclave  was then conquered by the wandering herd of storms that grog once belonged to after finding it  occupied by these rather brutal barbaric individuals vox machina set into the city  destroyed and tore down their leader kevdak to much fanfare from grogs past and through  kevdaks son and grogs majestic might they decided to take the remainder of the herd of  storms and take out 
none	 umbrasyl the great black dragon half the herd didnt like that and has  decided to leave to their own devices where the rest of the party possibly prepares to plot and  plan a way to kill an ancient black dragon  travis i dont like the way he said that whyd you have to say it like that its just a black  dragon  matt what else am i going to say  liam why the dramatic pauses  matt because its fun  travis you used the word somehow  matt i like it you guys 
none	 having just finished this stroke of a conversation with zanror in the  margraves homestead the dawn light is now beginning to pour over the mountain range in the  distance the day has officially begun zanror has stepped out and has begun to speak with a few of  his trusted herd members to stand down for the day letting people know that the battle has been  postponed for the time being while a plan is to be enacted prepared for and then sprung the  following day the rest of you guys have this day to prepare 
none	 however you see fit so i ask you what  would you like to do  sam we have so many things that we need to do  matt where do we begin  sam we need supplies we need to parlay with our allies we need lots of chains  laura we need to trap the dragon obviously on the ground  sam for that well need some bindings of some sort chains hooks spikes  taliesin i have a thought i have a thought in that direction when were ready i was thinking  of basically building what 
none	 is essentially a giant pressurized mousetrap  laura is there how would you do that  liam how much time do you need perce  taliesin do i have access to some people to help build it and some perhaps broken homes and chunks  of wood and chain  matt you do have access to broken homes chain and scraps at your disposal as far as individuals  that can aid you you have individuals that can help hold things for you the herd of storms is  not known for its ingenious use of tinkering tools but  
town	 laura what about blacksmiths in town are there any blacksmiths left  matt you can check around  taliesin this would be a blacksmith just to make a couple springs this is not a complicated this  is literally something you could make in the woods its a slightly more complex version of  something you could make in the woods to catch birds im just building a really big version  its a whole bunch of systems like this that will have chains and weights on them that when you  disrupt the weight at the center the whole 
none	 thing goes clunk throws a whole bunch of its  basically a netting system its an entanglement and will be an entanglement  matt okay ill tell you what go ahead and roll an investigation check percy if you dont mind  laura can we help him at all  matt yeah ill say if you want to go ahead and aid to that take advantage on that percy  taliesin thank god yeah no not very good  matt whatd you roll  taliesin i rolled a six  laura and matt with advantage  taliesin yes  matt 
town	 so after taking the better part of about three hours scouring the town most of the  remaining villagers  laura he took three hours doing that  matt three hours so from what hes doing with the aid of people that aided him which would be  vex asking about the few folks that have any experience with any sort of blacksmithy are the  folks that make horseshoes and thats the extent of the complication they can create so they can  attempt to with your aid craft some springs they have the materials to do very basic 
none	 metalwork  and ironwork but the people you encounter two folks in particular theyre both a little  confused by your overall design and are waiting for you to lead them in a specific direction  taliesin okay im just going to take them and im going to start building one and see if they  can follow suit then three springs will be more than enough for this design  matt how big a spring  taliesin i would say how tall is this dragon  matt roughly 30 to 40 feet depending  taliesin about a twotothreefoot spring 
none	 then three twotothreefoot springs made of solid  iron just enough to lift the system and toss and its just you make them like chainmail its a  process that exists im not going nuts  matt im not saying youre going nuts you are a little stretched for supplies and manpower based  on the circumstances in westruun for a complicated task but its fairly possible but it will pretty  much take the entirety of your day and most of your night to prepare this youll be able to  squeeze by with this with the construction of 
none	 the device and have maybe just enough room for ill  let you squeeze in a long rest  taliesin thatll be perfect  matt but thats success or fail  taliesin thatll do  matt okay what are the rest of you guys planning  liam three hours ago back when we were still together i pulled scanlan aside listen i want  to talk to you i have an idea  sam is this about kaylie because im still worried about her but i dont think that we  should discuss her right now we have other things 
none	 why are you harping on this shes my  daughter  laughter  sam just give it a rest  liam youre right i should have never dragged you down into the sewers and i apologize it  wont happen again but listen to me i have an idea its a dangerous idea and i dont want to  lead with it i dont want to fight this dragon to be honest but i think the group is going that  direction if we do percivals run off to try something maybe were just going to run out i  
none	 have an idea that only you can do  sam okay  liam we have a rod  sam yes  liam not the cube a rod that  cannot be moved  sam we could use it in some way  liam you can teleport and im almost too afraid to even suggest it but if shit goes south how  would you feel about teleporting inside of umbrasyls stomach with that rod  sam well what has he eaten because it could be nasty in there  liam i assume it will i dont know anatomy i havent 
none	 talked to my sister about this she might  be able to give us input and i dont want to lead with this i dont want you to do it because i  feel like you could melt in there  sam of course i could melt in there im a little man and hes got acid on him  liam i know im looking for a way through this fucking clusterfuck and if theres nothing else to  do you could go in there and click that rod and give him the worst suppository ever invented  sam listen 
none	 if theres a man invented who can go to where shit is made and make some really good  shit thats me so lets pursue this as a plan b  liam as a plan b and i take him by the shoulders you remember that little talk we had  about a week ago when you told  sam is this about kaylie again  liam no we can talk about kaylie in a couple of days all right  sam okay  liam when you told me how things were better now okay you remember that  sam 
none	 yes  liam that was fucking insane they are not better everything is terrible our lives are  terrible they are way worse than they were six months ago way worse i was with all of you  assholes a year ago and two years ago theyre way worse  sam youre saying that a sullen loner who is confiding in one of his closest friends while  holding him on the shoulders this you never had before  liam i slap him on the cheek a little bit and say you are a fucking madman but i am glad 
none	  youre here  sam im glad to be with you  liam and i love you and i give him a playful slap across the face  sam six points of damage  laughter  matt unexpected sneak attack 7d6 points of damage  sam all right so im going to go talk to vex an expert in dragons i hope  laura im an expert on dragons  sam and ask her how dragons work how their bodies work  laura what do you mean  sam where theyre vulnerable where they make the acid where they have 
none	 lungs where they have  stomachs how many stomachs are they like a cow with eight stomachs or something  matt go ahead and make an intelligence check with advantage  travis cows have eight stomachs  marisha theyve got like two or three  laura shut up 17  matt 17 yeah dragons have the pieces you imagine they would have in the right vicinity  their stomach is quite acidic as it has been known to dissolve some of the hardiest of  creatures let alone break down some basic minerals and materials so its not a happy 
none	 place  to be but its not like instantaneous dissolution it will hurt also know that the  breath weapon the acid that a black dragon which uses acid as a breath weapon in a stream in front  of it much like your lightning bolt does not come from its stomach that acid is much more  toxic concentrated and comes from a separate part of its body a gland a breathing mechanism  that projects it outward  laura wheres the gland located would i know that like in his throat  matt its somewhere in this vicinity 
none	 youre not entirely certain  sam so if i miss end up in that gland that would be not good  matt that would be really bad  liam dont roll a one  ashley but that would probably be really hard to just get right into that spot  liam but you know you wouldnt suffer  laura it would be instantaneous at least  sam also vex vexahlia  laura oh getting fancy now scanlan shorthalt  sam thank you your brother tells me that you have some sort of acidresistant something  laura the armor that i 
none	 took from him  liam yes my armor she has it  laura well are you here are you next are you next to me now  liam no im about five feet behind you rolling my eyes and doing this the whole time youre  talking about dragons  laura its the armor that i won fair and square from him yes i am wearing it right now  sam is that your primary armor  laura it is  sam how would you feel about me asking you to take it off doing a little unbuckling and giving 
none	  it to me instead  laura scanlan thats going to cost you a lot of money  sam we could swap armor  laura you think your little armor will fit me  sam i have a pretty broad chest these are pecs  laura what kind of armor do you have  sam i have cold snap leather armor  laura which is cold resistant  sam cold resistant maybe the dragon will throw snowballs at you  laura i doubt that what is it is it plus two  liam yeah  sam plus two on top 
none	 of the armor so its four  matt so its armor plus two  liam its better overall  laura okay well sweet then yeah sure give it to me  sam can we do that  matt yeah  laura strip on down there scanlan  sam well ladies first  laura no you first i want to see the cube and then ill give you my armor  sam shall we make it interesting and play a little poker  laura theres no time for that  sam all right i very slowly and sultrily unbuckle my armor 
none	 let one strap fall let the  other strap fall just do a little shimmy and let it fall to the ground sort of like the crying  game just sort of camera pans up a little bit and its just theres nothing underneath its  just me and the cube and i cry a little  laughter  liam during which i pick up scanlans shawm and start playing it terribly no idea what im doing  do you blow into this are there strings i dont know  laura i try really hard not to start laughing  
none	 sam go with what your body tells you to do  how are you going to take off your armor  laura thats a good question do you want to walk away for this  liam yeah i leave the room  laura i completely ungracefully take it off and throw it at you give me that armor how is this  going to fit me im just naked trying to squirm into these extraskinny jeans  matt actually as you pull the armor pieces up they shift and formfit to your size as part of  their enchantment  
dung	 laura what color is it is it beautiful  matt the cold snap armor is i believe dark browns with traces of white and silver along the edges as  a cold winter motif as part of the enchantment  laura does it match my storm bow  matt yeah i guess you could say that  laura you might not be getting this back scanlan  sam oh really well what does mine look like  matt for a moment it looks pretty haphazard and hanging off of you  sam oh these are like ccups up here  
none	 laughter  matt as the armor slowly retracts and finds itself to your form  sam oh they went down  matt in that moment scanlan learned a lot about himself  sam all right i feel good about this now well continue our dragon lesson i suppose  laura wait why did you need to change are you going to be up close and personal with him  sam well i think we all are you know  he breathes acid  laura well yes but  sam yeah so we could get hit now im more protected than 
none	 you are  laura this was a really stupid why did i give that up  sam im very charming  laura now youre not here  liam you told me to leave you took off your clothes im liam im not vax whatre you  talking about  laura are you planning on doing something  sam were all planning on doing something and i dont think that my part of the plan is any  stupider than yours will be so good luck to you ill keep your armor safe hopefully we can trade  back and if 
none	 not you can peel it off my dead body  laura as long as youre not melted from all the acid  ashley id like to attune to my frostbrand sword  matt okay so youll be putting aside the mace of disruption and taking on the frostband instead  okay cool  liam oh shit i go running after percival im going to go find percival  taliesin yeah  liam yeah well does that take an hour or do i catch up with him pretty quick  matt you would know the direction he went and thankfully in 
town	 the awkward stillquiet that is the  center of the town now that its missing most of its populace and those that are there are  acknowledging the tension of what might be coming and many of them are now packing up and leaving  and getting out of the town evacuating when theyve been notified of the possible coming  battle the sound of metal clangs in the distance and the gathering of materials from some of the  rubble is not too difficult to discern over time takes you about half an hour or so to locate him 
none	  liam oh theres that white hair percival  taliesin yes hello bit busy what  liam yeah im sorry i dont want to take up a lot of your time i reckon youre going to be busy  with this all day yeah  taliesin oh yes this is quite a project  liam ah and also tomorrow youre probably going to be taking potshots at that thing yeah  taliesin ah thats my hope is to be honestly as far away from this as humanly possible  liam thats probably not my plan can i have use of 
none	 your blade  taliesin oh the dragonslayer longsword yes of course of course i pull it off my belt and hand  it off could help im a little terrified that youre getting that close to it but here it is  liam its just in case  taliesin its quite a piece  liam good luck today  taliesin thank you  liam good luck tomorrow  taliesin i am down to my normal sword now  laura can i be talking to zanror  marisha ill join you in that that was my next plan  matt the 
town	 two of you eventually find zanror zanror and warra are in the process of piling  weapons and armor with the rest of the herd into the center of the town where the battle outside of  the margraves house happened most of the warriors there are in the process of steeling  themselves some of them are gathering their materials some are in the process of doing some  minor ritualistic scarring in preparation for the battle there is very little conversation  happening it seems like there is this quiet understanding that this for many might be their 
tavern	  last day theyre making peace with the coming glory of battle youd expect this sense of tense  fear this very battle of helms deeptype acceptance of doom but this is a different  personality amongst the herd here there is almost a brimming excitement with the idea of possible  glory or at least a glorious end and it very much befits the story that youve heard of grogs past  history and very easy to see where he once came from  laura i bring zanror a big tankard of ale and sit down in front of 
none	 him  matt oh good to see you  marisha i stand behind vexahlia  matt this for me  laura yeah  matt looks to worra  marisha dont worry we wouldnt try to poison you the night before a dragonfight  matt laughs that would be rather stupid wouldnt it  marisha it would  matt and he just downs it all in one big chug thanks  laura zanror did i hear you correctly before that you have been the one speaking with the beast  in the past  matt i have aye  laura so 
none	 when it comes and gathers its treasure it stops and talks or does it just come and take  it and leave  matt it has at times more at the beginning if it had questions and seemed curious that wore off  after the first few times now it just seems to come and take and find its way out  laura so if the treasure looked different this time it might stop and talk about it  matt he stops for a second maybe  laura im curious because i know you said you are lacking in gold 
none	 and treasure what will entice the beast  matt hm beyond that i dont really know thats what is forcing our hand right now  laura what if we had a way of providing some gold  and maybe you provide an offering of a different kind what if you say that your father kevdak had  been plotting against the dragon and you found out about it would you be able to offer his body and  the body of his allies as tribute to the dragon  matt huh  laura dragons are vain  matt and you 
none	 do know specifically white dragons or sorry black dragons theyre very cruel by  nature they actually enjoy messing with creatures they see below them especially intended prey  torturing for extended periods of time before killing they arent comparatively as vain as  other dragons per se but all chromatics fall in some way shape or form on that same scale of  selflove to the point of being a neardisease to many of them zanror thinks to himself for a  second and goes we can certainly try i mean ive got no more use for it though 
none	 its going to  be hard to convince it without a head im pretty sure grog took that with him  laura well we may be able to get that back how are you planning on hiding your fellow warriors  from the dragon so as not to attract its attention because we may have some ideas  matt well have to share ideas ours was to go ahead and plod up gatshadow usually its about  noon when it comes down for the offering we leave it what little we have left possibly lose two  men in the 
none	 process of delivering it and then when it returned to its place wed be there waiting to  ambush it once it returned use that time when it was gone to go ahead and hole up inside its home  laura okay  matt that was our intent  marisha we might be able to do one better  laura a dragons lair is not  marisha especially a black dragons lair  laura we wouldnt do much damage to it there in fact its probably laid several traps against us  already  matt well theres not much we 
none	 can really do when were all fighting with our fucking axes and  swords can we in the lair at least its stuck on the ground  laura what if we could trap it onto the ground here  matt how do you intend to do that  laura we have a wonderful tinkerer quite talented and hes creating something to trap the  dragon  matt really  laura plus we can provide several chains once its on the ground maybe your very strong  goliaths could try to snare it grapplinghook it throw some chains up and over 
none	  marisha this pile of weapons you have here i see a decent amount of javelins a rudimentary  harpoon in the hands of some of your strongest could help wrangle him down  matt he stops for a second and goes i just want to be clear we dont underestimate the sheer size  strength and ferocity of this beast with all 20 men we might be able to hold it down i dont  know how long i hope that contraption your friend is making is strong enough to aid us that last  little bit because i 
none	 get the feeling that if our might is put to just keeping it on the ground  well thats a lot less of our strengths that we could be tending to a lot less blades we could  put into its hide  laura well hopefully it would only be needed for a small amount of time before our magic users have  their way with it  marisha about that time i light up my hands  matt thats impressive you know what else is impressive watching four of my friends melt in a  matter of seconds  
none	 marisha that is very impressive youre not wrong  matt i just want to instill with you an understanding not to be brash not to go ahead and  run into this unless youre absolutely certain now ive got chains youve got chains weve got  strong men if we put ourselves intent on just holding this beast down i have the feeling even  with our weight behind it its going to be a difficult attempt do we have any other way of  anchoring it down something else we can put the chains to  marisha about that 
none	 time i walk over to the is there a stone wall in here  matt i mean there are pieces of stone building in the vicinity  marisha i put my hand against the stone and i cast transmute rock and i push my hand into the  stone as it turns to mud  laura and now turn it back keyleth  marisha i take a spear thats on the floor stick it in and then turn it back  matt all right let me look this up real fast  marisha see magic  laughter  marisha put 
none	 my hand underneath the spear put my hand over the spear  laura ah ah no strings  marisha where is it where is it  matt yeah mud to rock yeah lasts for its instantaneous so when he looks at that he goes  so what youre saying is if we can find a few places in which the rock is close to the surface  you could lock these chains in  marisha i think i could lock the whole dragon in  laura once its on the ground if we can pull it down enough she may 
none	 be able to lock its legs into  the stone  marisha beyond that if that fails and then i cast for right now ill just do wall of stone  im just burning through all my spells as a demonstration and i bring up two pillows two  pillows  ashley and then we all lay down and go to sleep  sam pillow fight  laughter  liam billy mays here for the ashari tribe  matt goose down unexpected tactic  laura i like how were walking through all of these ideas and none of its going 
none	 to work when we  get there  marisha i blast up two pillars right next to kevdak  matt not next to kevdak you mean zanror  marisha sorry sorry sorry the other big goliath leader  sam whatever your name is  matt that one ohmygod  marisha and trap him in  matt okay you rumbles warras pushed to the side as the stone shoots up  marisha whispers sorry warra sorry so i know did not mean to lay a hand  matt all right your point is made weve got two others who can do 
none	 similar magic as you maybe  not the same level but  marisha fantastic  matt want us to put them at your aid  marisha that would be wonderful beyond that in prep i can dig a trench hidden underground  around our trap so that whenever were ready your army can bust out of the ground  laura surprise  marisha without being seen  matt without being seen what are we going to bury my men  laura very lightly  marisha pretty much to be fair i actually did it on a trap to kill like 
none	 eight of your men on the  way in and it worked phenomenally so you should trust me  laura it was pretty great  marisha it worked well  matt i think well take our chances above ground please  laura the only thing im worried about zanror is that if this ugly beast flies in and sees oh  how many of your men do you have  matt currently were sitting at 25 total including myself  laura 25 men standing around dont you think its going to be a little curious as to why all of 
none	  the sudden all of a sudden theres a large number of people around thats never been there  before  matt youre asking me this our plan was to go inside while it was out but if you want us there  lets figure out a way to hide then i dont think my men are going to like to be  underground  marisha itll be very spacious itll be a nice big tunnel its not going to feel like youre  buried alive  matt and what they just leap out one by one through an opening 
none	  laura itll be super shallow just enough that they can come on up and out  marisha itll be awesome it will look like theyre coming out of the grave theyll look like  badasses  matt i dont think thats going to really get a dragon shaking in its claws yknow sighs  laura not a lot is going to get a dragon shaking in its claws  matt let me talk to my men well see what we can do we can muster as far as these chains go  laura a surprise attack is going to 
none	 be one of our best shots at grounding this thing  matt so am i to tell my men were  going to bury them in the ground  marisha not bury them that sounds so dramatic when you say it like that i mean im going to  make a tunnel therell be stairs theyll be able to walk freely theyll have air holes itll be  just like when you moved through the sewers to not be seen  matt ill talk to them i certainly hope your magic stoneshaping is as strong as it is at the 
none	  very first moment that dragon looks like its going to go ahead and break free were weapons  out you do understand that  marisha we would appreciate that actually  matt okay  laura we want it to land then we strike we just want it to hit the fucking ground  matt okay and whats our bait you say you have some gold to give  laura some gold to give  matt try for kevdaks corpse i hope thats enough ill see what else weve got left in our  coffers he turns around and him 
none	 and warra walk away a couple of the men join them and they  marisha oh i actually i go over to warra real quick before she walks away just to her side and  say you look well have the seers told you if its going to be a boy or a girl yet  matt not yet but if we survive this i have a feeling ill know the strength and glory of this  fight will confirm  marisha if you survive this fight im pretty sure youll bear the strongest child anyone has  ever known 
none	  laura the stallion that mounts the world for sure  liam there it is there it is its in all our heads  matt nothing ever goes wrong when that title comes up  laughter  matt what could possibly go wrong she looks over her shoulder at zanror as hes walking away and  goes could be and she just turns and starts walking with him  laura so we really need to dig a trench  marisha yeah im going to start digging a trench  laura around the area that the treasure is going to be 
town	  marisha how far is it  matt you guys scope it out its northwest of the town you saw it on the way in and its very easy  to make out at this point because there have been large clawmarks in the ground there are broken  pieces of wood theres a shattered cart theres some barrels that are partially destroyed to the  side theres a little bit of leftover ends and pieces that fell out of whatever it picked up as  it took off as well as a smattering of copper silver and gold pieces 
town	 that you rummaged through  before when you first came to the town but theres a definitive place that you recognize  where this drop point is its out in the open in the field theres going to be a couple of nearby  rocks a handful of trees but theyre all very sparse and spread apart other than that its  just open field so  marisha how far away is the nearest tree cluster  matt to that its about tree cluster i mean most of the trees that are here are singular  theres two trees that 
none	 are within ten feet of each other and thats maybe 80 feet away from it  marisha okay  laura when you dig the trench can i use my perception and my ranger ability to camouflage  things and make sure that from above the ground from the height that the dragon will be looking at  it that its not seeable at all i dont want this trap to be seen i guess i should wait until  we find out if percy finishes his trap and gets it in place to do all of this  matt you 
none	 can do that if youd like to yeah as far as the camouflage ability  laura i know hide in plain sight is for myself but i feel like as a ranger id be able to hide  tracks and stuff  matt ill say we can certainly give you  laura we can use a little dust of tracelessness or something  matt we can make something function a little bit there you know illusion magic is also helpful  if you have anything illusionbased that could even just help tidy up before you do know that  dragons 
none	 are very perceptive creatures and are very are not very trusting either theyre  paranoid that is part of their narcissism so anything you can use whether it be illusion  camouflage anything to hide any sort of possible chance of it not trusting this scenario youre  going to want to do otherwise this thing might fly overhead and notice one thing and be like ah  peace so be warned miss dragon specialist  liam that was all knowledge in your head  laura i know all of these things all of a sudden  marisha did he 
none	 just say dragons have really high perception so dont fuck with anything and make it  look weird  laura no he said if were going to do it make sure it is hidden  marisha right make it look real good right  travis can i go up to some of the guards outside and say oi where do you keep your  prisoners hostages meat shields  matt i mean there are no real guards of westruun anymore most of the guards that  travis i meant like the goliath the herd guards  matt yeah the herd 
town	 guards theyre a little sparse right now there arent any towards the  outside of town most of them are gathering towards the center as the rest of the folks are  leaving the town finding their way out south of westruun to be away from the battle but you do  find in the margrave center similar area to where they were talking to zanror there are gathering  warriors that are getting their weapons ready some of them armoring up to just see how easily  they can get it on some of them might even sleep in 
none	 their armaments its not a huge thing but as  you approach and ask this question one of them turns to you and goes well theres the iron  stocks is where we generally keep our prisoners the ones who were before and the few we did keep  well those we chained up or executed but there were a few that were thrown in there  travis are there any still in there or are they all clear  matt oh theres plenty of prisoners still in there we didnt touch the prison mostly  travis hm all right 
none	 thank you whispers what was reginalds daughters name  laura i dont know if i wrote it down  sam i wrote it down  travis id like to make my way over to the iron stocks  matt okay and youve been here before you know the iron stocks although you werent sure if it  was being used as still a prison and seemed loosely just throwing a handful of people in for  use later on that never quite came to fruition  marisha i dont know her name either we might not have known a name 
none	  travis i thought we knew her name reginalds daughters name  matt do you remember her name  travis are you asking me  marisha what sam wrote he just wrote down reginalds daughter  sam maybe he never told us her name  matt laughs all right you make your way to the iron stocks and it is currently unguarded there  is nobody there the herd has lost interest in it the doors partially ajar and as you walk inside  you can already smell the place just reeks of refuse and decay it looks like everything 
none	 left in  the middle of a workday there are still ledgers open on the front desk you can see what looks to  be a small group of a barrackstype scenario to the left of the entrance that is just completely  abandoned and looks like some cases are left open scattering various keepsakes and bottles that are  shattered on the ground a lot of people left either to go into battle to defend against the dragon to  lose their life in it or just to get the hell out of dodge  travis can i walk 
none	 up to the ledger and pretend to read it  matt yeah you pick it up and leaf through for a few pages lotta great squiggles  travis yep  matt some pretty handwriting you can tell  travis any squiggles that look familiar  matt um no no none that i mean some look familiar some are more rounded  travis oh this poor bastard right here yep i remember him good chap hello is anyone in here  matt theres a slight pause then you hear a voice echo from the right side of the room down a 
none	  hall just through the stone you can barely make it out because the distance its at because  youre hearing the echo protrude from quite a distance but a voice just says hey hey in  here need food please  travis oh shit so i go in that direction open the door and try and make my way that way  matt you charge down the hallway and there are a number of cells that are immediately here some of  them are open and abandoned entirely there are a few that you look off to the side 
none	 looks like a  few individuals just passed away inside the cell you come to a set of stairs that leads down into  the next subterranean region and you hear the voice again much closer be like hey hey i  hear your footsteps and you see a hand reaching out from behind some of the bars  travis put your hand back inside  matt the hand retracts as you look over  travis thats a good lad whats your name before i approach still far enough away  matt ah orn orn finch at your service been 
none	 in here far too long and very thirsty i will be  happily at your service fair muscled man should you see fit to relinquish me from these binds  and you look at him he looks like a lowly beggar longish tattered hair wearing just general  tattered and soiled clothing no shoes feet look blistered and black  travis ugh im going to call you orn blackfoot  matt blackfoot it is orn blackfoot at your service if you could just  travis my name is lord grog  matt lord it is my pleasure and he reaches 
none	 through and grasps your hand his fingers are bony  and thin and he takes it and shakes it with what little strength he has  travis man you are looking a little rispy pour out a little ale into a goblet and i give him a  goblet of ale  matt he snatches it from you and slurps into it extremely thirsty  travis ahah not too fast not too fast dont want to get the bubbles and i reach into the bag  of holding and i have a dry food ration i have three left now 
none	 i have two and i give him some  dried food ration  matt he takes it and eagerly starts jamming it into his mouth as hes eating hes not even  talking at you this is just sheer hunger the need to survive has taken over and hes just  cramming it in there choking a couple of times keeping himself okay  travis pace yourself lad tell me why are you in here orn blackfoot  matt ah well this is everyone just started yelling and they abandoned us all here its been  terrible hearing the moans 
none	 and screams going silent i thought they abandoned us all  travis no they did to be clear they totally abandoned you you are really the only person i  know of thats in here all the other mates around you theyre either sleeping or you know  matt i appreciate the food and drink youve certainly done at which point a voice comes  from about two cells over behind you that goes did i hear food and drink  travis fuck  matt food food and drink please please  travis orn did you kill all those dried 
none	 food rations just now did you just  matt you see him very discreetly pocket some in his robe oh everything you gave me is gone im  sorry friend  travis man what an appetite do you mind regurgitating a little like a momma bird into my hand  matt what  travis never mind orn dont heh dont move and i walk over to see where the other voice is  coming from  matt okay as you turn around the way there is the next set of bars you see behind there a man  in his 
none	 forties also extremely thin and gaunt reddish long thin beard long unkempt brownish red  hair that is just crimped up around the base of it like its just gone almost into dreadlock  territory from how long hes been in there and mistreated you can see dried blood at the corner  of his mouth he looks up at you sir if you would be s grog and the moment of recognition  hits you this is abjurist noja whom you previously  yelling  travis abjurist is a very powerful he has knowledge of the arcane and stuff 
none	 right he was  laura he was the guy who saved us he saved us when the white dragon came to westruun  liam i was frozen in ice that guy  travis i found us boba fett sweet  matt he looks pretty wrecked right now  laura oh shit give him food grog  travis abjurist nosebleed hold on real quick look and i take the other the second to last dry  food ration i give him that and i give him a thing of ale im like im sorry its really dry  matt thank you 
none	 friend thank you very much  travis oh yeah youre very welcome hold on is there anybody else in this hallway before i give  away my last bit of food  matt you hear two voices simultaneously down the end of the hallway come in one of which is a very  weak female voice the other is a very loud kind of hey bring me food this way please the  other one is like please i ask of you im starving and you see these two hands come out of  the two cells in the distance 
none	  travis right im going to pick a number between one and ten ready go  matt theres an awkward pause three seven definitely seven  travis i lean over to abjurist noja i say i actually dont know any numbers so yknow what  were going to deliberate and well be with you in just a moment whispers abjurist how old y  why are you in here who put you in here  matt ive only been in here for about a week got in an altercation in my store when these  brutes started walking in threw

none	 the cells or can i look for keys  matt you make an investigation check  travis fuck me  matt yes  travis your fate is in excellent hands oh shit youre not dead  laughter  travis minus two for a 17  matt ah all righty so after spending the good part of an hour or so clamoring through just  throwing bookshelves over and crashing taking the desk and actually throwing it onto its back  and pulling drawers out this is grogs method of investigation here youre just  travis yeah just trying some splinters 
none	 of wood in the locks just in case  matt yeah yeah you break off a few forks in some locks  travis laughs forks yeah  matt in practice yeah whatever looks small enough and should fit though it doesnt but you  make it fit and it doesnt help you do eventually find in one of the cells closed and  locked as you look by there is one person in guard armor in westruun guard armor that is in  the cell not moving  travis hey hey you i kick him in the back a bit 
none	  matt no movement  travis i kick him harder  matt no movement  travis i look down the hallway i back up a few steps and i really run up and kick him really hard  matt he just lurches over onto the side not moving  travis yeah youre dead can i pat him down  matt yeah you reach in and you can smell the decay starting to set in and as you get close you  can reach through the bars and see him the actual area is closed and the door appears to be 
none	 locked  and inspecting the body very quickly you can see that he was stabbed multiple times from behind and  probably left in here to bleed out  travis low perception  matt but you do find on him what appears to be a ring of keys not directly on his body but  underneath the corpse like he was you gather best you can someone probably grabbed it got  their way out used that moment to stab him and escape  travis nice i take the keys and i jauntily run by orn blackfoot and i go 
none	 to abjurist hey  do you know who those other two voices are at the end of the hallway like did you have anyone with  you when you got put in here  matt no no one with me although been plenty of angry discussion from that dwarven fellow down  the way  travis yeah hes got a really rough accent  matt i can hear you  travis shit my voice carries are you all right here for one minute i have to go perform an  interview real fast  matt im all right and he 
none	 just finishes eating the little bit of the ration that you gave him  like dried meats and bread  travis all right sit tight all right you two put both your hands outside the cell where i can  see them  matt they both put their hands out the dwarven man you can see puts his hand out the skin is  very wrinkled and you can see the varicose veins on it the arm hair that you see on the dwarven  arm is white like bright white the female hand comes out is thin but the 
none	 skin looks a little  softer and younger  travis female elven or is this female  liam the daughter  travis who said three  matt at this point the dwarf voice goes incoherent semicursing  travis i know look its always lucky number three right thats what they say who says that  matt racist little peh and the arms just withdraw and the woman thats me thats me  travis oh good hi you look nice  matt look down you see a young woman maybe in her late teens early twenties long brown hair  tangled 
none	 covering one half of her face you can see the edges of her lips are cracked from just  dryness and lack of moisture shes wearing both of them actually are wearing just these long  simple cloth drapeover robes that are just yknow for any prisoners in here that need to not  be wearing their normal clothing  travis ive got three other goblets left can i both give them a goblet and some ale just to wet  their lips and get a drink in  matt they eagerly take it and begin scarfing it down the 
none	 dwarfs like oh thats nothing you  can look at the dwarf now hes elderly crotchety halfblind one clouded eye but for  being a man whos been stuck in prison and slowly dying hes got this wry grin on him at all times  travis youre turning away good ale looks like youve seen many a moon  matt youre telling me that but no seriously thats like half full come on dont be stingy  travis i like your gall and i pour more ale in  matt thats the ticket its like spilling on the sides and

none	 outskirts of nojas shop nojas shop is untouched by the battle it seems still stands  marisha oh shit really  matt he walks up and the doors open and looks inside and just sighs heavily as the interior of  this place has been picked clean  marisha ah son of a fucking looters  sam noja were there any hidden compartments or secret safes where you kept the good stuff  matt well follow me and he heads towards the back of the shop heads into a room in the side  which contains his bed and his 
none	 personal setup that doors kicked in there was a lock on it the  locks still hanging as part of the door contraption as the actual door was just kicked  inward and the wood splintered and left open he steps inside feels above the doorway theres a  panel of wood that he pulls aside and brings out there is a singular book where he pulls it out  and sighs blows dust off it ah this is a bit rudimentary for what i require but its  something its better than nothing puts it aside manages to find 
none	 some pieces of his clothing  that have been tossed onto the floor as a heap or you know raiding the room and gets out of his  prison robes and puts them over that to just go ahead and not be as tattered as he looked he does  pull what looks like a small jug from it and sets that aside and he looks around his room sighs  i guess lets see if theres anything in the shop that still remains steps around the way oof  all right yeah most everything of worth appears to have 
none	 been taken or broken  laura search around help him search  travis yeah is there anything we can help you find that youre looking for  matt anything intact really  travis yeah can we help him look for any vials or  matt make an investigation check  travis better 17  sam 16  matt 16 okay looking around most everything is ruined destroyed or missing however you do find  what looks to be two unspoiled undestroyed vials that were part of a display set that has been  tossed over the side most of the 
none	 fluid contained in these vials like corks have been left open  glass and crystal have been shattered and the contents had just stained the floor and dried over  time into little sticky pools of different colors you do find two one of which is a yellowish fluid  thats streaked with black swirls and there is one that its like a clear liquid that has a the  liquid itself fills the vial and then shrinks down to a tiny bead and then expands again to fill the  vial like a very very slow heartbeat those are 
town	 the two that you find  travis what  marisha yellow with black swirls and then a clear potion that  sam oh hell just tell us i assume sir were about to embark on a deadly adventure to try to  clear this town so that you can once again live here safely might we trouble you to borrow these  potions if they can be in some way helpful to us  matt youve done me great service by getting me out of that hellhole you are welcome to take  these with you for now i guess 
none	 i have to start from scratch  sam do you know what they are  matt oh yes im sorry im sorry and he takes the vials and looks at them ah this is a  potion of diminution it shrinks you to a smaller size  sam oh i could be small oh wait  matt it only lasts for a few hours depending the magic isnt perfect but it does make you  smaller this other one this vial contains a liquid that will make you quite speedier it will  increase your metabolism for a short time 
none	 the world around you seems to slow its quite  effective  sam thank you so so much  travis yeah actually have you ever seen this shrinking potion work like how small does  something get  matt pretty small like if on your size and he makes a shape of about that big  sam so teenytiny  matt for you yes for you youd be about his size  travis that would be the best thing ever now that youve found im sorry go ahead  sam no no no this is most helpful do you know 
none	 anywhere also around here where we might pick up  some chains hooks spears javelins  matt ah those are not my forte my apologies  sam all right  marisha shouldve took those from the prison  matt i mean check a general goods store perhaps  sam oh no this is so helpful thank you let me go get those  matt so here are your potions  travis that book that you got its not your favorite right the one that was hidden above the door  matt no no but itll do at least do you 
none	 wish me to inspect that weapon for you  travis yeah would you mind ive never done that before but the last one i had talked to me  matt thats unsettling thats very unsettling  travis yeah among other things  matt the dwarf and the woman are still waiting at the door theyve picked through things and  theyre finding bits of broken glass and over time they cant find anything else he takes the hour  to rest and regains after some quick preparation the use of at least his identify spell takes the  axe holds 
none	 it for a moment chants some incantation that you dont understand theres a  brief glow on the weapon and around the outskirts of his fingers a brief glow around his temples  as it fades he goes hm well if what you worry about is the presence of some sort of sentience i  can assure you you need not worry this is merely a tool and a powerful one at that and he begins  to tell you what it does which is exactly what you already know after attunement  travis no long card coming laughs  
none	 matt no  travis son of a bitch thank you abjurist you are as wise as you are old  marisha old laughs  matt im only 48 but thank you  travis thats lost on me do you need anything else  sam oh oi oi i was just im enthralled by these potions theyre fantastic and im  enthralled and so happy that we met you again and all that i totally remembered who you were  laughter  matt its good to see that youre all doing fine considering the circumstances stay safe  ill pick up 
none	 what pieces i can  sam should you get should we tell him to get out of the city or fight with us  travis well i was going to ask you do know what is beset upon this city right the horrible  calamity thats coming  matt i saw the dragon tear through yes  sam we aim to finish the dragon maybe even tomorrow and make westruun free once again would  you have any interest in aiding us in this fight or are you past the point of putting up a brave  battle  matt 
none	 and you see him standing there even just standing here this time his knees are wobbling a  bit and he goes im afraid i wouldnt be of much aid at this moment without my proper  spellbook i have a few childs treats at my disposal and he sifts through a few pages and he  seems to the book looks like its pretty old like probably his training manual when he first  began to study as a practitioner of the magical arts i dont know how much use id be  unfortunately  travis the days still 
none	 young what say we give like a solid effort to finding your bigger books  and then if you cant find it and you can lend no aid to us well make sure you find yourself  safely on your way  matt all right all right fair enough well come let us look perhaps we should give another  onceover of the rather seemingly destroyed interior of that prison  travis yeah  matt looks like amelia and old davin have nothing else better to do they begin to aid you for a  bit although amelia is eager 
town	 and mentions the possibility of going and checking in on the  farmsteads on the outside of town  marisha yeah about that  matt orn orn blackfoot gone  marisha yeah figured that much  matt he has peaced  travis he left  matt yeah you guys take a moment and when you start deciding what to do and you look around and  hes just gone  sam i thought you had him  travis i thought you had him i clearly said when you came up watch the guy with the black feet  whatd you 
none	 do  sam i was watching you you have disgusting black feet you walk around barefoot youre  disgusting  travis i really cant argue with that  laughter  travis well whatever i saved a life go me ill take it later yeah so can we go back to the  prison not to take away from everything else and maybe look for chains like some hooks maybe some  broken bars  matt yeah the two of you guys make one more investigation check thisll signify the next few  hours of looking for the things you want 
none	  laura oh god roll really good  sam 22  travis 19  matt between the two of you working into and past dusk you manage to acquire quite a number of  chains its funny a prison seems to have a lot at their disposal they have a queue of chains  that are used of various lengths some of them may have to be put together to make the length of  which youre looking for but between ramshackle manacles to just lengths of chain that are used to  opening gates and used to seal elements 
none	 of the subterranean portion of this prison you manage to  acquire quite a bit you do towards the end of the evening manage to find partially destroyed  remnants of nojas spellbook he seems a little disappointed as soon as he sees the state its in  a lot of the pages have been burnt and torn out of these  travis i am sorry  matt ah its all right there are some here that are of use to me and if i can be of any  assistance tomorrow in this fray hopefully at a distance how 
none	 big is this dragon you said  travis oh its like seven feet  matt oh well then i can definitely be of help there not a worry all right ill prepare myself  best i can  travis yeah well make sure well keep you on the outsides with those that are not you know  cant take a good walloping  sam do you have any healing potions or anything or i mean im sorry healing spells  matt thats not my specialty i fear and the potions i had are now soaking in the floorboards  of 
none	 my humble shop  travis not that i would understand but could you tell us what your specialty is  matt abjuration of course thats the school of magic of which my laughs  sam im familiar with that  travis abjuryeah mmhmm no idea what that means  liam like claymation  travis oh like puppets im a big fan of puppets  sam all right well well get some rest try to put the pieces of your place back together  matt i will come to me when the time is ready to face this fiend this foul 
none	 creature and im  happy to help  sam good night  travis oh yeah we should probably make him a part of the feast  sam oh all right  travis well come get you later tonight  matt all right  liam im going to track down the women after talking to them over the earring  matt okay  liam straight from percival once i catch sight of them can i talk to you for a minute  marisha sure  liam just a minute i know youre busy um  laura shes super busy brother  
none	 liam yeah two minutes two minutes um  laura so busy  liam thanks stubbs youre way more powerful than i am and i dont know what im going to  skype noise  sam god dammit  liam whats that sound  marisha so many noises happening  liam youre going to be doing a lot more damage than i am tomorrow its not like im going to run  up and stab the thing in the back i feel like youre probably going to be too busy to be using  fassbender  marisha yeah do you want 
none	 fassbender i was actually going to offer him to you cause i feel  like you might  liam i think i want to be of use so yeah  marisha im pretty sure you dont have to worry about that  laura gagging  liam so it just goes on the head then how does it work what do you what do i talk to it or do i  think it or what do i do  marisha so you give it a command it takes your full concentration to give it a command and then  once 
none	 you do that it will enact that plan until its complete or until you tell it otherwise  liam all right  marisha and if you wanted to cast a slow spell just you have to focus and tell it to do that  liam okay do i say like slow  marisha you know i dont know just wing it i kept talking to him like it was a person and i  dont think thats necessarily the way to go  liam maybe ill prac where did you park him  marisha its still in scanlans mansion  
none	 liam oh  laura is that still there  sam yes  matt well based on the time that spell was cast the 24hour duration has expired all things in  the mansion have been jettisoned from the doorway  laura including your grandad  marisha so hes in wilhands house with wilhand  liam great well ill take that  marisha yeah hopefully wilhands watching over him right now actually  sam it might have destroyed the house  marisha it mightve destroyed wilhands house yeah  liam kiki  marisha yes  skype noises  liam what is 
none	 that  marisha this is the weirdest field  taliesin makes noises on skype  laughter  liam percy tinker quietly please  taliesin makes louder noises on skype  laughter  liam i think hes eating popcorn or maybe opening a butterscotch candy in the theater  taliesin i cant even see you guys are you like  laura oh he went away aw this is just not  liam okay really quickly  laura okay well at least he started  marisha yes this seems to happen all the time every time we try to talk to each 
none	 other i dont  think ive really continue continue its hard to have a conversa  taliesin hi  matt continue please  liam hello yeah percival ill talk to you in a minute all right  marisha shut up percy thank you  liam ah ive been confused i am confused but  and i take her by the hand  liam it wasnt fair last week it wasnt fair to you and im sorry  marisha what are you talking about  liam in your room in your room me leaving wasnt  marisha when you left me 
none	 right  liam wasnt fair  marisha yeah no that i remember yeah that yeah yeah yeah yeah  liam thats it im sorry  marisha im sorry if i dropped that on you and put any more undue stress thats not what i want  liam this is awful all of it is awful  marisha this is awful yeah no this is pretty bad you know ive actually been wanting to talk  to you i wasnt entirely planning on now i know youve been struggling i know you feel like  youre drowning and im sorry that 
none	 the raven queen chose you but she did choose you you know  as druids i was raised to have an interesting perspective on the gods we are taught that nature  is the one true powerful force i have yet to see a god control the sunrise and the sunset so  therefore its hard for me to sometimes have the same faith in these gods personally i believe  that just because youre immortal doesnt make you infallible these gods can be great ambassadors of  their virtues and what they represent or they can be horrible disgraces 
none	 to their domains and just  because some selfproclaimed person or deity decides that they want control doesnt mean that  they have to have control over me  now this does not mean that i do not respect the gods and the power that they wield but i mean  for the love of sarenrae we have seen pike do many a powerful thing so therefore i do not  respect the gods any more than i respect the living people who are standing beside me at this  moment so ive also been coming to terms with the 
none	 fact that it seems that whether we like it or  not we are going to have to employ their services looks like were going to have to be  working with them in some way or another myself included if we are going to overcome this  so maybe you should start rethinking the way you look at your relationship to the raven queen  maybe this can be a fine partnership a fine endeavor to do with her and then once we save the  world and we retire and some other young prodigies come forward to save 
none	 the world again then we can  thank her for her services and move on i dont think well always need her i dont think you  will always need her and keep in mind the one true thing that gives these gods their power are  their worshipers so i guess ill let you choose what you want to be and i walk off to catch up  with the ladies  matt all right  laura did you guys make out was it really fun lots of making out there  marisha vax vex vex  laura i 
none	 understand you have him on your mind you cant get our names straight  marisha you know i was talking to him so hey i love you a whole lot  laura do you still think youre talking to my brother  marisha i know who im talking to  liam really similar  sam shes the ranger  ashley did you ask him if hes going to help us  marisha who vax oh  ashley vax is he going to help dig the trench  laura i turn around and see him is he just standing there  
none	 matt just standing there lost in thought yeah  laura um hey  liam what  laura hey what are you doing are you coming to help us or are you just standing in the middle  liam yeah we gotta kill a dragon tomorrow we gotta kill a dragon what do you need  laura do you want to help build i dont know a trench set a trap  liam i mean im really weak but i think i can use a shovel  laura what time is it we havent even started digging the trench yet what 
none	 fucking time is it  marisha itll take me like an hour its fine what time is it  matt for you guys at this point itd probably be midafternoon late afternoon percy i need  you to go ahead and make three tinkering checks for me if you dont mind  sam oh shit  matt the first one is using your intelligence modifier  taliesin thats intelligence modifier plus proficiency bonus plus tinkering  matt well proficiency bonus is what you get with tinkering  taliesin yeah 24  cheering  matt all right so initial designs and 
none	 describing with your lackeys for lack of a better  term that are helping you develop these springs you manage to explain lay out and develop the  proper materials the process and they seem to acknowledge and understand what youre trying to  do and you guys begin the work second check is going to be with your dexterity modifier  taliesin oh yeah baby  sam no one can help him on these things  laura were not there  taliesin 22  matt you spend the better part of the day helping them take the metal strengthen 
none	 it bind it  pulling it into the springs that are required you complete one you get partway through the second  one make a final check if you dont mind  travis with dex  matt this is also with dex yeah  laura come on  taliesin thats 23  matt 23  taliesin yeah its the dexterity right  matt yeah  taliesin so yeah thats right 23  matt 23 as the evening comes into about ten or 11 oclock at night after hours of aching work  sweat beads dripping down the foreheads of the 
none	 three of you forcing the furnace to work  overtime the rooms heat and darkness eventually almost puts you to a point of exhaustion and  passing out however you do manage to complete the springs they seem to be functional the  structure of your trap is set we shall see on the morrow if it is as functional as you hope it is  you do take a point of exhaustion through the work that will consist throughout the next day  taliesin okay what does a point of exhaustion do  matt disadvantage on ability checks so 
none	 essentially any skill checks or ability checks  you make not attacks or saves but ability checks you make for the next 24 hours will be at  disadvantage  laura did he work all the way through the night  matt no this is just the physical activity involved in getting it done in that short period  of time  taliesin just doublechecking because i have no brain currently dice roll dex modifier  proficiency bonus  matt what  taliesin just because i have no brain dex modifier proficiency bonus dice roll  matt correct  taliesin 
none	 okay good  matt youre good you got it as you guys find yourselves resting for tomorrows trap incursion  and hopeful defeat of umbrasyl we will take a break for the rest of you and come back here  laura oh god theres more we have to do  sam its okay well do it during the break  matt well come back in we need a pee break quick one guys  break  matt and welcome back so as youre preparing for this what else do you guys need to do before  the morrow  marisha 
none	 i dig a trench  matt all right so you dig the trench  marisha i want it to be far away to where theres a tunnel and then make a circle around it  laura we need to get fassbender into the middle where the treasures going to be  liam i walk fassbender out and i lay him down on his back faceup  marisha we have to do some stagesetting here we have to set the scene  matt okay as a note when you return to willhands house fassbender and willhand were  both ejected from 
none	 the doorway fassbender doesnt fit in that large room and wrecked part of the  staircase from underneath but is fine as soon as you acknowledge fassbender to start moving  fassbender who has been inert this entire time since left there for the evening before takes a  step and the area where the crack that you sealed earlier reopens it looks like there is a minimal  magical effect that was more of a cosmetic effect in the healing but being a construct it does not  actually heal damage from it  marisha okay can i go 
town	 ahead and take this time to do  sam youre not there  marisha oh im not there yet oh no im building a tunnel youre getting fassbender  never mind  liam yeah im walking fassbender out to where keyleth is  matt okay stomping fassbender follows you out to that area of the town as night has come now  the sun has gone you guys are working in darkness what are you guys doing  ashley vex can i have one of your arrows i want to make it real special  laura youre speaking my language 
none	  ashley okay so i grab one of her arrows and i cast glyph of warding on one of her arrows  laura how many arrows can you do that do  ashley i think just one  sam matts checking his email  matt within an object that can be closed such as a book scroll or treasure chest so yeah it  would have to be on something that like a doorway or  marisha like a treasure chest if can you cast it in like a barrel that hes going to break open  ashley okay  
none	 laura thanks i really enjoyed the idea of that  ashley i thought it was going to work it was going to be real cool  matt so you decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell for glyphs inscribed in a  surface the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph removing  another object covering the glyph approaching within a certain distance of the glyph so you  could place this in theory on the ground near where the treasures being left and give it the  specific trigger for it to go 
none	 off  laura it can be maybe in a chest above fassbender cause hes going to be buried and  then it can be triggered maybe when the dragon lifts it up  marisha what exactly does it do the glyph of warding  matt you can choose explosive runes  ashley an explosive rune  marisha oh so it explosion thats cool  matt 5d8 acid damage cold damage fire or lightning or thunder damage your choice  everything within a 20footsphere radius around it  laura 20 feet is really big oh my god you know what you 
none	 could do you could make a trigger if he  gets a certain height off the ground and that way if hes over 20 feet above the ground then it  triggers and hes the only thing that would get affected  matt well it triggers as a glyph so whatevers near the glyph would be affected  ashley so can we hide it in the loot  matt you can you can definitely choose some sort of a small chest or the ground underneath the loot  if you want to  ashley okay ill find something in the 
none	 loot some little chest or something that i can put it in  matt okay and whats your trigger  ashley when he gets if he starts to fly away  matt okay so if a creature the trigger would be if a creature  liam pulls the glyph up  matt thats up to you what would you like the trigger to be  sam specific  ashley if he removes something on top of it but also if he grabbed it  laura what if it gets above a certain feet in the air can it trigger then 
none	  matt you can say if a creature flies above it at a certain height it can trigger ill give you  that yeah  ashley okay so if it flies  matt if it flies 20 feet above it  laura i thought it meant if the glyph lifted in the air  matt well make that one of the triggers if you want it to be lifted so if the glyph is lifted  by a creature  ashley so it cant be if he just touches it  matt you could do that yeah  laura but 
none	 it might be better if he lands and then we spring the trap it could be a thing if he  tries to leave it explodes  ashley if he tries to leave  matt okay so if the object is lifted off the ground it triggers  ashley yeah even like this much if its just moved  matt okay and youre doing explosive rune what type of damage  ashley i want to do cold damage  laura would i know is a black dragon does it have any weaknesses  matt you would know with your knowledge 
none	 and specialization it does not have any weaknesses  laura it has no weaknesses  matt it is immune to acid damage of course but that is the only real information you have  travis make it acid damage  laughter  ashley im going to go cold damage  matt cold damage all righty  laura what about fassbender is he immune to any damage  marisha im pretty sure hes immune to most kinds of damage  liam no its hitting and slicing ill check  ashley im going to cast it at fifth level  matt fifth 
none	 level all right that brings it to 7d8 cold damage and whats your spell dc  ashley 17  marisha if we lose fassbender  liam hes expendable hopefully he survives if not good cause  laura can we fuse some chains into fassbender so that he can be attached to the ground  marisha i can can i do that right now  matt using what  marisha i want to take and cast a stone shape spell and then i want to open and almost make him  a chain harness thats embedded into his waist and then 
none	 while im at it can i patch him up  matt stone shape is instantaneous so whatever you want to do it happens immediately so  essentially you could with one casting of stone shape seal the wound with another casting of it  you could then go ahead and have the chains  laura ready to go squishing  matt yeah just embed them in and have it seal how many chains are you embedding in it  laura two big ones  matt two big chains okay so you get two of the heaviest chains that you can 
none	 find which you  probably got from the prison  marisha all right well how about this vax vex grab a chain  laura all right these are heavy  marisha okay ready on my go  laura wait where are we putting it  marisha im going to shove them in his abdomen okay im going to make a spot and just  laura you take left ill take right  liam okay  marisha ready  liam yeah  matt okay as she does that suddenly the chest wound opens up into these two big cavities you  
none	 take the chain edges and put them inside as they seal around them theres now these two giant  heavy doorholding chains that are now dangling for about 70 feet on each end from his abdomen  laura where do we attach these chains to the ground  liam one to the ground put the other one in a goliaths hands with a harpoon or a hook on the  other end snag our prey and then we have a fassbender hanging from the bottom of a dragon  marisha okay  matt you can find some metallic hooks just 
town	 through general construction materials in the town  if you want to  liam i think we should do ten or 15 feet to the ground of chain and ten or 15 feet to the dragon  so that its thunk and hes caught on the ground  laura just ten  liam yeah  marisha okay  liam yeah well sever the chains with grogs muscles we need to get em the right distance  matt about how long  liam ten feet into the ground which we can  marisha do it right now ready im going to 
none	 do another stone shape spell into the ground  matt you have to go around and find an area because a lot of its dirt you have to find an  area that has actual stonework in the ground otherwise its just earth thats pulling it go  ahead and roll a survival check  marisha not bad whats my survival 24  matt 24 okay you take some time its about 60 feet out from where the drop point is is the  nearest piece of nearsurface stone its about 15 feet beneath the surface but it is viable 
none	  marisha negative i will cast  laura why cant it be 15 feet below the surface  liam but hes going to go up like a kite now because its going 60 feet all the way over there  where stone is  marisha im going to burn i did that earlier but im going to burn my last 5thlevel spell to  do transmute rock again  matt okay  marisha so you said there was dirt all right lets dig a little bit of a hole real quick so  we dig a hole ten feet down 
none	  matt okay  marisha put the chain in there cover it back up transmute turn it into rock  matt okay and with that the earth okay what is the radius of that one there let me see  sam we have to cover this up  liam with dirt  marisha and treasure  matt transmute rock 40foot cube you turn that into a solid fucking subterranean block of stone  all righty now you have fassbender just there stuck to the ground with the chain at its side  liam fassbender lie down lie down  marisha 
none	 can i take my last little bit of stone shape residual energy and take that mustache vax  drew on  matt stone shape does not  marisha and make the mustache permanent that he drew on with charcoal  matt sure ill let that slide with the remnants of the spell magic fading the nowlyingdown  fassbender staring up with his vacant sunken blueglowing eyes towards the night sky and the  stars above your hand reaches across the face and with that suddenly the  marisha i like this i want to keep it there we go  
none	 matt the oncecharcoaled curly mustache recedes into the face carved permanently to his face  marisha you look much better now fassbender highfive  liam give keyleth a very soft highfive please  marisha yeah isnt that cool  matt thatll probably bruise tomorrow  marisha its okay its cool  liam i quickly take that same charcoal out and i write in common on his chest conclave or bust  laughter  sam im going to go to keyleth and ask if i can borrow the rod of immovable rodness how big is it  matt its like that 
none	 long its like the rung of a ladder  sam got it  matt its got a little button on the side  sam button on the side cool  taliesin like a tron lightbike  sam i love it  laura when are we going to set the trap that percy made  liam as soon as he finishes it  marisha yeah we should set the stage  taliesin in theory it has to be laid down underneath all the treasure so that it just is  nothing and then we put everything on top and then basically 
none	 its set and then pins get pulled  so that its set and you dont disturb shit again  marisha hey percy were ready to fly in the trap whenever you are  taliesin yes lets do that gentlemen lets move it good work ladies and gentlemen  marisha while you guys set the trap im going to turn into a raven my job is done here im going  to just go and circle while theyre setting the trap and setting the stage and do patrol and make  sure were not being watched  matt okay make a 
none	 perception check  laura why this creepy music  sam its random guys  ashley why is he doing his eyebrows up and down  laura because the fucking dragons going to see us right now  marisha 16  matt 16  marisha no sorry 15  matt 15 you circle for a while and keep watch so far nothing seems to have caught your  attention thats out of the ordinary about half an hour passes before you see a group of  civilians along with percy wheeling on carts this large ramshackle construction made of  support 
none	 beams from houses metal joints that were used as basic construction elements as well as  these large metallic springs on multiple sides with hooks and elements of a chainbased net that  has been piecemealed together eventually you guys bring it over you clear out the area  laura fassbender will lay on top of the trap  matt fassbender will lay on top of the trap  laura right he cant lay under the trap  sam well if its like a mousetrap cant he lie in between it taliesin how does it work  marisha lets just 
none	 keep him right off to the side because if that trap triggers  taliesin in theory he should be able to fit right at the sides of it because its got an  armature spring system as long as youre not in the way of the armatures you should be fine  matt so you set it up and away laying the sides down precariously putting the pins in holding it  in an open position you begin to take dirt dust and gathering up the area trying to hide it to  the best of your ability who is 
none	 in charge of camouflaging this piece  marisha go ranger go ranger go  matt make a survival check  travis which dice will i use theres no way to choose  sam can i aid her in this bit of camouflage  laura you want to sing me some inspiration  sam can i inspire her  matt sure what do you want to sing  sam singing rrranger turn and face the strange rrranger looks like youre going to  have to hide this shit time may save me but i hope you also do  laughter  
none	 laura 31  matt 31 you guys take a good portion of the next hour or so under her guidance and tutelage  hiding this entire trap getting dirt the top layer of sand to cover it so it looks like it  hasnt been recently disturbed  laura little dust of tracelessness  matt little dust of tracelessness to fill in and smooth out any of the ripples of any possible  passage that has come through fassbender has been  crash  matt killed buried beneath the surface just to the point where hes pretty much flush with 
none	 the  ground of where it is contraption set the objects placed back inside with some of the  barrels and some of the leftover pieces of wood the one overturned cart you go ahead and take the  chest and you place the glyph onto it it takes a while to cast that spell about an hour but you  complete it without an issue  laura make it look like theres treasure on it i take some of the gold that we have and  matt place it onto it  laura a thin layer where it looks 
none	 like a lot of gold but its really just a thin layer of gold  over top of rocks  ashley if its a chest can we put some coins sticking out of it so it looks like its full  matt you can do that it does cost you about 200 gold worth of components to do this glyph so mark  off that from your personal gold supply  laura grog  travis yeah  laura question we sort of thought maybe we could use kevdak as a tribute like we sacrificed him to  the great shitty 
none	 umbrasyl is that his name  matt umbrasyl yes  laura but it doesnt quite have the same effect without his head do you still have that head in  fact i think i might have the head did i put it in my bag of cold  matt you did i believe you gave it to her to put in there  laura would that be all right with you grog  travis no  laura dont you want to kill this dragon grog  travis i want that head  laura i dont have the head i only 
none	 have the gross bear tattoo off kevdak  travis thats right i put the flayed skin i dont have the head  laura grog i can tell when youre lying  travis i dont have the head  laura youre lying grog can we maybe youll be able to get it back because were going to  kill this dragon and then you can just go and pick up the head and keep it again in your bag of holding  travis whats the head for  laura so we can make it seem like we sacrificed kevdak to the 
none	 dragon  travis what if you sacrifice me  laura well what  travis yeah use me as bait  sam wed have to chop off your head  marisha no we could just tie him to a chair or something  travis or i could just put my hands behind my back  marisha make it look wrap some rope to make it look like its loosely tied  sam what if he bites and kills you  travis well i dont know but its better live bait than dead right at least when you fish  sam nope 
none	  travis pretty sure thats true  sam nope  laura do you want to be bait grog  travis yeah  marisha does that sound fun to you or  laura theres exploding things around here are you sure you want to be in this area  travis yeah  ashley no you dont  travis laughs no i dont i will give you the head of kevdak  marisha oh my gosh it took a look from pike  sam wow thats a powerful look  travis i want it back  ashley youll get it back  
none	 travis you better promise  laura i promise  travis all right you can have it  ashley with a bow on it youll get it back  travis i dont want a bow on it he didnt ever wear a bow  ashley no im just saying youll get it back  travis i take the skull and roll it to her feet its still got flesh on it right  matt yeah its a little soft but it works so you have the head of kevdak at your disposal trap  is set percy whos pulling the pins 
none	 whats the trigger mechanism  taliesin the trigger mechanism is any weight shift its the same as a mousetrap its like you  put pressure on it you take pressure off of it doesnt matter as long as theres immediate  weight shift in the platform where the booty is it just goes snap  matt okay so very carefully and very precariously you all have set this trap as the  final element aside from the camouflage is there anything else you would like to add with this very  sensitive large situation being finished  sam where are 
none	 we hiding  laura were going to hide in the trenches yes  marisha it depends on where you want to hide i guess caws  taliesin as long as im within range for my guns im going to hide way off in the treeline  marisha yeah there were two trees that were 80 feet or 60  matt which ryan can i get the box of tree materials thank you  sam you know that box of trees that you have  ashley are we near any structures or any houses  matt no this is outside of 
town	 town its an open field other than a handful of trees just to give  you guys perspective right here this is the setup right now this is the central area where most  things have been dropped there are pieces here if you want to put it into perspective here the  glyph lies over in this area most of the treasures been placed in that area the trap  well say is set about in that area with the central piece being the triggering mechanism  laura and the trench is all around that  matt the trenches 
none	 are down in this area oh now you say the trenches are you saying theyre  covered or not  laura they are covered  matt so theyre tunnels theyre not trenches where is the opening for the tunnel where would  you like it to be  marisha far away  laura there on the other side  matt this side over here  travis make it 50 feet at the most  marisha i want it to be more than that id like it to be 100 feet away  travis you want them to get there in 
none	 one turn right  laura you want to be able to get there right away on surprise attack spring right out of the  ground as soon as that trap triggers  marisha no  taliesin in theory if the trap is sprung itll make enough ruckus that anyone in those trenches  should hear it  matt right but its more about the proximity of the exit to the trenches  marisha yeah what im thinking is ive got a circle that ive carved around it and then  theres like a tunnel that shoots off this way and 
none	 theres an entrance that they can walk in and get  into their places  matt you want them to just burst out then  marisha ive made it really thin like i did before carved it nice and thin  matt okay so the entrance is back here then  marisha i dont know what that means  travis i thought we were all filing out of one hole  matt thats what i was getting at beforehand the intent is for them to push up and out  marisha unless you guys think it would be better  
none	 laura no i feel like theyve gotta burst out yeah  travis i was confused  marisha its going to be cool like night of the living deadstyle orcs coming out of the ground  in my mind its really awesome  sam in your mind so many things  marisha so many things  matt there we go all right we have entrenched areas in this vicinity with you around it whats  the last things you need to prepare before the evening is done  laura we need to have a feast  sam heroes feast  liam 
none	 i have a couple of questions one so i asked this outside but i just want to make sure  it says in the rogue section that longsword is something that im proficient in but theres a  rule somewhere that i cant find that says i cant use that for sneak attack on page 95 it says im  proficient in longswords  matt correct  liam but somewhere else that im unaware of no surprise motherfucker  matt the attack must use a finesse or ranged weapon  liam so its not a finesse weapon  matt a 
none	 longsword i believe is strength  taliesin no wait this longsword was being used as a finesse weapon  marisha it has been used  taliesin we had this discussion at one point we decided that this longsword was a finesse weapon  or it could be used as a finesse weapon  sam aloha  taliesin aloha  liam in hawaii the longsword is a finesse weapon  taliesin theres a beautiful view out this window  liam just want to know in advance  matt i would say stretching it thin we had agreed it was a finesse 
none	 weapon for use meaning as  a dexbased modifier for you to use in combat specifically when did this discussion happen im  trying to recall  taliesin this happened when we were doing sword tricks we were discussing whether or not i could  actually use a sword and what that would be like because we were having the conversation about  whether you should take strength with the sword ive obviously been using it as a dexbased sword  but i dont remember if that was specifically for me or  sam this is a tough decision but 
none	 you know its not a tough decision to subscribe to loot crate  matt i would say because it is part of the intent of the weapon that the longsword while it may be  circumstantially used as a dexbased weapon for that purpose it is out of your realm of expertise  when it comes to using the sneak attack ability it would not be able to sneak attack  liam lovely im going to take off my boots of haste and my cloak see if anyone else wants it  and im going to start attuning can you 
none	 use this  laura what is it  liam circlet would you be able to control fassbender  laura instead of shooting arrows  liam no keyleth said you just say zap and he just does it until you tell him to stop  marisha yeah it takes your concentration so it takes  matt well it takes an action to  marisha im trying to speak in character all right  taliesin what do your boots of haste do and what does your cloak do out of curiosity  liam i want to see how much im giving up 
none	 here haste will let you double your speed youll be  able to do one more thing when youre doing things scanlan showed me some sort of potion  marisha yeah im assuming that was a potion of haste  sam i gave the potion of haste to grog we both found these two potions grog has the potion of  haste if anyone else desperately needs it and i certainly dont need to be any smaller so ive  given the potion of reduction reducement  matt diminution  sam diminution to good old vax here  liam its 
none	 funny because part of my idea was to go in with you but i know that you have to do it  to folk of your own size but if i were little vax i could go with you  laura why cant you keep your boots on for that  marisha honestly spellcasters its not as beneficial for us to have haste  liam thats true but im wondering if anyone wants fassbender if im going in im not going  to be able to concentrate on that  marisha well depends on when youre going in  sam 
none	 you dont know give it to vex  marisha if you focus on fassbender and tell him to just attack or to cast slow he will do that  until that dragon is dead he will just continue without you having to focus on him  liam i know i just dont want to miss a shot to go into the belly of the beast with my little  buddy here  marisha thats so trite  sam we were born to do this  laura does it have to be attuned  matt yes so if you already have 
none	 three objects attuned youd have to take one off  laura no i cant wear the circlet dude  liam all right ill wear it  taliesin i could definitely if you could take the haste potion then i might take the boots  because speed would not be a terrible thing for me to have because then i get to shoot more  liam im going to take this sword and im going to leave the deathwalkers ward on that cant  come off anymore and the circlet so the boots are up for borrowing and the displacer cloak 
none	 is up  for borrowing displacer cloak makes you very hard to hit  laura thats good  liam and the haste will haste you  taliesin what does the cloak do again  matt disadvantage on physical attacks against you until you get hit and then once you get hit  it fails to work for a turn  travis i might take that  marisha the cloak  travis yeah oh my god im going to take the belt off  sam youre going to lose your beard  travis you dont know that this shits in there 
none	 tight i take the belt of dwarvenkind and i put  it in the bag of holding i put the displacer cloak on  matt you will be losing 26 hit points to your maximum hit points  travis what wait really  matt your constitution or no its plus two so youd be losing 13 hit points on your max hit points  travis never mind no nope  matt because your constitution will go down without it  laura i can take off my bracers of archery too and put something on  marisha what do those do 
none	  laura they just give me a plus two to damage rolls  liam youre wearing a cloak so if you wear the boots you can click them and youve got more  movement  laura all right give me the boots im putting the boots on  matt boots of haste  marisha then ill take the cloak i guess im going to take off my spell slot ring and i put my  goodie but my oldie circlet on  sam lets have a feast lets have a feast  matt you guys prepare for the evening you 
town	 make your way back to town where are you having your feast  sam isnt there a central place that we killed kevdak at  marisha the mayors the big mansion  sam whatever that place is called  marisha the margraves house  matt all right so you find your way to the margraves town square there you can see a number  of the remaining herd of storms are sitting around small fires in the center of the cobblestone  theyre all warpainted up you can see theres smears of various dark charcoal andor crimson  liquid smeared 
none	 across them in patterns there is a brimming tension of coming battle you may do your  heroes feast if you wish you can feast up to 12 creatures as part of it  marisha i can also do a feast if i cast it at seventh level but fuck it im going to sleep  so it doesnt matter  sam youre going to do two feasts  marisha pike and i are both going to cast heroes feast so that way we can feast 24 people total  matt all right  marisha so tell kevdak sorry fuck 
town	 tell zanror his finest warriors his druids  laura and abjurist noja  travis and old davin  liam and his wife  marisha so make sure we have zanror his wife his druids that he mentioned there were like two  to three druids  ashley are there any magicusers in the room  travis magicusers or clerics  marisha magicusers or clerics  travis abjurist and old davin included  matt so that being the case you guys have your meals in the center of town summoned forth a  grand heroes feast two side by side the 
none	 chosen soldiers step up and you all begin to feast upon  your meal the taste is great but youre all distracted as the energies of the divine  enchantment of these food items fill your body and steel you against the coming fear there is still  the concentration in your eye as you all look off listlessly in the distance as you finish your  food its now just pushing past midnight  laura we need to sleep  matt everyone seems to go and find themselves to rest a tense sleep before them anything else you  
none	 wish to do before you go to bed  marisha rise at sunrise rise at dawn  travis wait before we do that didnt you do something that gave us an extra amount of hit  points before kevdak  ashley i have shield of faith that i can put on somebody  laura will that last for 24 hours  ashley its up to ten minutes i can do it tomorrow  matt what youre thinking of is aid and that lasts for eight hours thats the one that gives  the additional hit points he just mentioned  
none	 sam does the heroes feast give us additional hit points  marisha 2d10 and youre immune to poison fear  matt as temporary hit points should mention that too its a separate pool so 2d10 additional hit  points you want to roll keyleth  marisha oh jeez dont let me fuck this up oh thats not bad 14  travis 14 thats not bad  marisha 14 from me  ashley 12  matt okay well say the 14 goes to your group the 12 goes to the rest of them for the purposes  of this so thats 
none	 a separate pool the 14 hit points come off first before anything else  travis if its midnight i would take aid just in case he comes in the morning and if he  doesnt no harm done you rest up anyway right  ashley say it one more time  travis i wouldnt mind taking aid in case he comes in the morning if eight hours pass i lose  it anyway but you rest up again  ashley do you want to have it for the night  travis yeah just in case he comes in the morning 
none	  ashley sure  marisha well when do we want to be at the trap dawn  sam at dawn  liam just before  travis yeah before first light  laura he comes normally around noon he said  marisha so we need to be in our places by 5am  ashley so each targets hit point maximum and current hit points increase by five for the  duration  matt for each level of the spell so if you cast it at higher levels its more  travis how high do you want to cast it  ashley 
none	 cast it at fifth is the highest that i have now  travis rock out go for it  ashley yeah lets do it  travis five times five  ashley thats yeah  sam youll lose it when we wake up  ashley yeah do you want it for tonight  travis itll hold for eight hours right or but i lose it  matt eight hours yes but a long rest is eight hours so  ashley yeah itll go away lets wait  marisha what time of year is it  matt its winter cresting into spring 
none	  marisha okay so we have long nights right now  laura we need to go the fuck to sleep  marisha so lets sleep for a good six hours  matt six to eight hours  laura set our alarm clocks  matt you run on a pretty consistent schedule being a ranger  liam i wait until everyone falls still and then i scrabble over to you are you awake yeah  youre awake  marisha yeah im staring at you  liam i dont know if its the food you made or the fact that were going 
none	 to die tomorrow but i  want to kiss you and i kiss her for a while good night  laura did you use your tongues  travis youre asleep  marisha how does she see everything  liam shes a witch  marisha shes a witch  liam shes a witch did you see the broom  matt the evenings rest comes to fruition you guys wake up as the very distant dull blues of  first morning light begins to crawl across the distant mountain ranges dead silent is the  morning as the rest of the herd 
none	 begins to rouse and armor up you hear the gentle clank of metal  against metal as armor and weapons are gathered food is being prepared cooked and eaten without  a word being spoken between them  sam i just want to make sure that were going around passing out all the chains attaching  little hooks and jabby things and grappling hooks  laura they know the plan as soon as he lands on the ground everybody springs up and  matt everyone springs up and hooks him  sam if the trigger for that theyre going to 
none	 be underground  laura the trap should go snapping  sam if they hear a big clank thats go  laura get up and out yeah regardless  sam will they know that thats a big clank  laura im sure itll be pretty loud there might also be an explosion  matt all right with that zanror after having this discussion at the margraves makeshift war  room in the front foyer agrees not to worry ill make sure the men have known well sharpen  the hooks sharp enough to dig into dragonhide hopefully well hold taut and 
none	 the moment that  creature breaks free weapons are to fall on it very well he puts on the rest of his armor  everyones feasted for the morning weve lost taliesin  sam dont worry his work is done he made his trap good  matt its like hes on the internet in hawaii or somewhere  sam lets do this  ashley right when i wake up i am going to try divine intervention  matt right now  ashley yeah  matt okay hold on just a second  travis yeah man its as good a time 
none	 as any  sam does it last for a while  ashley i dont know  laura you used it before  ashley no its never worked  laura yeah the guy showed up  ashley thats something else  laura oh really  ashley that wasnt intervention  laura i thought that was divine intervention that made the guy show up  ashley its never worked  matt so divine intervention there are elements of it that could be preparatory by the nature of  it its more of a sudden prayer of desperation its one of those things 
none	 where the effects can  range it can be something thats immediate it can be something thats more long understanding  that acknowledge when would be the good time to use it whether it be now or later depends on  what youre requesting what youre praying for  ashley to come help us kill a dragon so that  matt okay go ahead and roll a percentile dice then  ashley what do i have  matt roll 2d10 you may have a die that has multiple numbers on it  ashley i do is this the percentile  
none	 matt yes roll that first whatd you roll  ashley what do i need to roll  matt i believe you need to roll under your level what did you roll  ashley i rolled an 80  matt yeah  ashley it never works  matt so as you call to sarenrae the boundaries and barriers that keep the gods from directly  interfering with this realm are particularly strong this morning  while you feel her glow upon you her warmth and protection guiding you to victory there is  not more within her strength or sphere of 
none	 influence she can grant you at this time  ashley dammit i dont feel her warmth though  matt what else would you like to do  ashley just go eat  matt all right so the sun has come up the hour hits to eight nine in the morning youre looking  at about three hours until the dragons  marisha wait what time is it  sam its nine  marisha son of a bitch we overslept  sam no weve been up since dawn  marisha i thought we were trying to get in places before dawn 
town	  sam well were moving now itll be fine  marisha i hate it when i oversleep  matt all right the rest of you and the rest of the herd make your way north the few people that  have stayed behind in the town the few stalwart stand outside as you all march by and they all  acknowledge bow their heads some get down on their knees and pray for you as you pass as you  quietly make your way outside of westruun into the plains between the dotted treed landscape towards  the drop point 
none	 the herd makes its way under the tunnel beneath the ground  laura i cast pass without a trace on all of us  matt all right so they are now beneath the area they are situated there is the entrance tunnel  off to the side that is currently visible and open from that portion do you wish to close or hide  that tunnel  marisha sure  travis im going in that tunnel too  liam scanlan where do you want to go  matt grog you have hidden  sam i dont want to go underground 
none	  liam are we going in a tree  sam were going to go up in a tree lets go 200 feet away  ashley im going to run up to scanlan and im going to cast death ward on him  sam whats that do  travis if you drop below zero you come back to one  matt once  sam i dont need it im okay i know that youre very worried about me because of our love but  matt so scanlan you have death ward on you you are now up in this tree here 
none	  sam i dont need it it jinxes me  ashley im going to cast protection from energy acid onto vax  matt vax actually already has resistance to acid because of his armor  ashley im going to cast it onto vex  laura thanks  matt okay so vex currently you have resistance to acid as long as concentration remains  marisha i also cast protection from energy resistance to acid on grog  matt grog you also have resistance to acid  marisha im going to stay in this cluster of trees with scanlan  matt scanlan 
none	 over here okay  laura im going to be up in a tree  matt youre going to be up in the tree  sam different tree  laura yeah  sam i dont think we should all be in the same tree guys  laura no im going to be in a different tree can i use my perception to see how hidden  everything is  matt well say up in this tree you want to be up in this one over here instead  laura yeah something far  matt there we go youll be in this 
none	 one  laura i think percy wanted to be in a tree too at a distance  matt all right well say percy is over at this one here watching his trap hopefully spring  liam vax is with scanlan stuck like glue  matt is trinket in your necklace  laura yes  matt all right where do you want to be did you want to cast your aid spell on anybody before this  happens  ashley oh yeah yes  sam matt were more than 150 feet away yes  laura and matt some people  laura 
none	 like the trees are 80 feet away from the stuff  matt this here  sam i would like to be more than 150  matt about 70ish feet away is right here where these trees are  laura okay  matt youre about 50ish feet  ashley im going to cast aid on keyleth  matt at what level  ashley fourth  matt thats 15 additional hit points to keyleth  marisha additional or temporary  matt not temporary additional keyleth who else  ashley scanlan again  matt scanlan and  sam why dont you do it 
none	 on yourself  ashley okay i have low hit points ill do it on myself 15  matt yep 15  sam keyleth can you help me  matt do you cast it again or are you just happy with those people you can cast it multiple times  if you have the spell levels for it  ashley im going to save my spells  matt okay  sam im going to need help i know a little bit about dragons i dont know a ton can you help my  knowledge of animals in any way shape or 
none	 form for some sort of a check i dont know i just want  to make sure that i know everything i can know in the moment when checked  liam can bards inspire themselves  matt no at higher levels he can  marisha theoretically i could enhance your ability but its a concentration spell and ive  already protected from acid against grog  sam never mind im fine  matt all right  marisha what does your cloak do that i put on  liam disadvantage on attacking you  marisha like melee  liam until you 
none	 get hit and then its gone for the round but resets for the next round  marisha only melee not spells yeah  liam thats right  matt so at this point in time kevdak approaches  sam zanror  matt i did it again zanror and two of his goliaths stay there waiting with the offering  placed at its designated spot  marisha shit i cant believe were doing this  matt any lastminute preparations  ashley im going to wait grog where are you  travis im down in the tunnel  ashley is that where i 
none	 am  matt well wherever you want to be  ashley i want to be in the trenches  matt in the trenches all right so you make your way into the trenches pushing past all the rest  of the herd members  laura i hide the hole  matt all right well say for the purposes of this spread so everyone knows where theyre all  hidden currently  laura everyone knows they need to not move at all and be completely  marisha quiet  travis im down over here  sam pike youre in the middle 
none	 of it oh shit  ashley im just going to hide im not going to be a hero  travis ill throw her out of there if something goes wrong  liam she doesnt clank if she doesnt move  ashley theyll see me shining with my shiny armor  laura youre right we need to be stealthy up in the trees  marisha i come over the earpiece in the calm of battle and i say if things go terribly wrong  rush to this cluster of trees i have ways that can get us out i feel like 
none	 i should say something  inspiring but i dont have anything so  travis how about fuck shit up  marisha fuck shit up as grog once said about two days ago  matt hiding off in this tree beneath you is noja invisibility spell and vanishes behind beneath  the ground here off to the side is your good golem friend hidden in the dirt quiet sets in  gentle distant wind as the midday sun begins to stroll through its quiet and quieter still you  can hear the gentle bristling of high grasses against themselves the tension 
dung	 causes the  muscles in the back of your shoulders and neck to knot up watching the sun slowly crawl to its  zenith wingbeat noises you look up those of you who are able and you see a dark shape a  shadow dart off from the top of gatshadow circles around past you towards the city comes back  growing larger and larger as it does as it comes within the vicinity it drifts up with one large  beat of its wings and impact sound lands into the center of this vicinity as it hits the  
none	 ground there is a tink creaking sound impact as giant claws made of wood metal and rotten  angry hooks slam up out of the dirt sending a giant cluster of dust just filling the vicinity  it woosh wraps around you hear the smashing of metal and wood and low guttural roaring dust has  filled the area and for a brief moment you have no visual on whats happened as soon as that  hits everyone around you in the tunnels bursts through the floor smashing through as the tunnels  begin to collapse inward also i need 
dung	 everybody to go ahead and roll intiative  ashley did he move the treasure  laura not yet  liam come on meteorite die dont dick me  marisha green lucky jade thats okay  liam matt colville this is on you  sam its not you liam its me  marisha fucking shit  sam not good liam yours doesnt matter mine does  marisha is yours not good  sam no  laura what did you roll  sam its okay we got this pikes going to win the fight for us  liam hey can i use 
none	 luck for initiative  matt what does it say for the ability  sam it doesnt matter liam  matt ill find out here it counts as an ability check i dont see why it wouldnt  liam its up to you youre the boss i love you youre the allseeing eye  sam the feast gives us advantage on all initiative checks right  matt ability check or saving throw technically you get plus two to ability checks correct id  say sure you can reroll initiative if you want  liam laughs it was the exact same number 
none	  matt you use the luck point and your initiative is what it is starting at this point in time  everybody  sam its a fight  matt we have 25 to 20  laura 22  travis 20  matt all right 22 vex the herd actually rolled really well  sam good we need that  matt grog all right 20 to 15  taliesin 19  matt 19 for percy is that it so we have noja 15 to ten  liam big ten which if you think about it rounded is like 100  marisha 
none	 also big ten which if you round it twice is like a thousand  ashley 13  matt all right ten to five  sam big five  matt big five right there scanlan holding up the rear there we go  liam gosh plan b indeed  matt at the top of this surprise round i need vex to go first  laura am i first  marisha youve got no he has fassbender  laura he has fassbender i guess im just going to shoot it i mean what else can i do right now  liam you 
none	 do you  laura all right my boots of haste have been clicked  matt all right so you are now hasted you may now have an additional attack action per turn  laura badass im going to hunters mark him  matt all right  laura wait yeah because im still hidden in the tree right  matt correct currently as far as you know hunters mark on umbrasyl  laura okay im going to hunters mark him im going to shoot him with my longbow of the sky  sentinel so im going to roll  matt go 
none	 for it now he is surprised so you actually have  laura advantage  matt well you have advantage because he doesnt see you so yeah  laura okay so the first one is 12 plus 15 is 23  matt 23  laura 27  matt 27 hits  laura 25  matt 25 hits  laura and 23  matt 23 hits  laura so okay those are regular attack plus lightning arrow attack right i all of a sudden  forget how it works plus 1d6 per arrow 1d6 for the hunters mark and then 1d6 on 
none	 the first one  for the sneak attack okay plus the regular  matt herds up next and then grog  laura 31 on the first arrow  matt 31 damage  laura yes  matt nice  liam seven plus five is 12  laura 12 plus nine  matt 21 youre not getting additional sneak attack for the other two hits by the way  laura right i know i lost my 18 i think 18 was the last one  matt all right so that was your sky sentinel attack  laura that was my first attack 
none	  matt correct  laura for my second attack im going to shoot him with one of my dragon arrows should i waste  it on him  sam of course hes a dragon this is it  laura i have two of them ive been saving one but im going to use one on him  matt all right  laura this is still advantage because its still surprise round right  matt sure  laura okay 24  matt 24 hits  laura okay thats still my hunters mark and then i have a jelly belly in my 
none	 thing and then  thats 10d6 additional damage for the dragon arrow  matt okay surprise round doesnt give you advantage but you were hidden from the top of the  round so you have advantage  laura oh okay so an additional 10d6 damage for the dragon arrow  matt go ahead and roll damage on that  laura no 6d10 sorry my mistake  matt there you go  sam shes going to oneshot the dragon  laura 6d10 counting  sam matt can i turn around and see keyleth and vax making out in the tree behind 
none	 me  matt they are not  liam were not making out theres a slow trickle of wizz going down my leg right now man  marisha yeah im hyperventilating  laura sorry 24 plus ten is 34 plus hunters mark is another four 38 on that attack  matt 38 points of damage on the dragonslaying arrow  laura and then my third attack im going to use the blazing bowstring  matt just so you guys are aware this is over 100 points of damage in one round  liam enjoy those boots  laura do i still 
none	 get advantage because im still hidden  matt no at this point in time ill say youve definitely made yourself known  laura 20  matt technically you shouldnt have had advantage on the other ones but  laura 20  matt pssh arrow splinters across the hide no effect  laura okay wow  matt all right staying there  laura im going to sink down into the leaves yes and try to hide better  matt you have no actions to hide but youre in a tree  laura okay  matt all right finishing your turn the 
none	 herd now is going to go shot from here hes going to stay back  all move in hes going to stay back here and aim they cant even get in theres so many of them  laura im trying to duck behind some branches so he doesnt have direct line of sights on me okay  matt thats fine  sam man what if this was all a trick and they actually work for him oh god were all going to  die it was all a trick they work for him theyre going to kill us all  
none	 travis if i were near you i would slap you get a hold of yourself man  matt throwing chains up some of them leap up and jab the actual hook into the side and try to pull  back having a hard time piercing hide its real strong  laura some of them can try to like swing the grapplings around the ankles  sam shh dont distract him hes adding  matt i got this dont worry  liam dont piss him off  matt all right well say about eight of them manage to actually get it 
none	 into the hide the rest  either bounce off or cant find purchase into its hide and it just scrapes down but the rest of  them are trying to hold it down we got him we got him and theyre holding back the archers  all take aim misses misses misses misses hits  liam question did we give the chain attached to fassbender to one of the goliaths  sam no its buried in the stone  liam to the stone but one has to go on the dragon  sam if thats what we planned sure  
none	 liam i dont know  matt you didnt tell fassbender to use it  liam oh no okay cool  matt thats two hits for all the arrows all the rest of them are just smashing against the hide of  umbrasyl no effect that is seven points of damage and eight points of damage they actually  make it through thats their round grog youre up  travis i go into a rage and i would like to run up behind him with my bloodaxe and make two  reckless attacks against him  liam hes got it hes 
none	 got a whole strategy hes streetsmart this guy  sam intelligence of three  travis 26  matt 26 hits  travis thats really good 28  matt 28 hits  travis so thats 23 with three points of necrotic damage  matt 23 three points of necrotic damage added in or on top of that  travis oh thats part of it yeah  matt 23 all right  travis and then the second one 22 with one point of necrotic damage  matt gotcha whack whack its a tough hide to cut into but youre making small hacks 
none	 into it  you can start seeing that damage is possible though its a lot to cut through this is a very  hefty very old beast all right  travis with my bonus action could i drink the potion of fast nuts potion of speed  matt well isnt it a bonus action to go into a rage  travis i believe youre right never mind  matt pretty sure it is let me doublecheck real fast  travis i think youre right  matt its fine yeah bonus action so thats your turn percy youre up youre way 
none	 behind the  dragon hiding by the treeside  taliesin okay im going to cast hex on the dragon  matt all right hex on the dragon  taliesin with a disadvantage to all strength checks  matt strength ability checks okay  taliesin im going to hold my turn until the dragons turn  matt okay youre just going to hold until it does something  taliesin im going to hold until it does something and if it does nothing im taking my  attacks and if it gets away im taking my attacks im just taking my attacks 
none	 after him  matt okay it is now nojas turn noja is going to step out from here and is going to attempt to  lightning bolt from the side he just reaches out hand forward arcs upward in its direction  it fails its saving throw because it is held in there it is currently considered grappled it  doesnt have disadvantage or anything but ill say from this standpoint it cant really move  around a lot its going to take the damage  sam laughs what was that face  matt terrible roll 21 points of lightning 
none	 damage  sam thats 8d6  matt at the end of his turn its going to use one of its legendary actions to make a tail attack  against you well say thatll be 27 to hit  travis thatll hit  sam can i use cutting words on the attack or to reduce the attack  matt if you want to  sam i would like to  matt okay so 27 to hit you take from the slam of its tail behind you  sam no i mean to im sorry i cant reduce the  matt oh 
none	 i thought to reduce the attack not the damage  sam the attack  matt okay go for it roll your d10  sam okay slidewhistle a d10 is this one ten  matt ten 17 whats your ac  travis its a 20  matt 20 with that the tail whack slams into the ground you manage to push out of the way  just in time as scanlan shouts up to the dragon  sam oi youre so ugly you entered an ugly contest and they said no professionals  laughter  matt just enough of a distraction 
none	 in the settling dirt for the dragon to turn its head over and its  tail swings just a little wide of you grog as you sidestep no effect well say for this its  less of a surprise round i use surprise round liberally surprise was it grappling and everyone  getting out of it and preparing for the actual assault  liam its more of a surprising round  matt correct umbrasyl does get a turn umbrasyl very frustrated and angry at the circumstance is  going to attempt to break free with disadvantage on the athletics check 
none	 to try and break out of the  grapple because of the hex all right that is  sam is that a save  matt no its not a save its an ability check however the strength struggling sounds cannot  seem to break free from the grapple of the communal might of all the goliaths there so that  is unhappy  sam meaning matt is unhappy  matt all righty  sam and three more dragons  marisha why the book  laura oh no what are we looking up  travis whats in the book  matt 
none	 nothings in the book guys  laura were literally going to finish off this bag of jelly bellies  liam if an ancient black dragon takes one hit point of damage it cowers and dies  ashley im looking for the popcorn ones  marisha thanks to whomever sent these jelly bellies by the way  matt thatll end umbrasyls turn that brings us to pike youre up  taliesin oh no thats my turn now  matt percys up then  taliesin im going to take just a standard shot with bad news  matt go for it  
none	 taliesin ooh 28 to hit  matt 28 hits  taliesin 18 points of damage with four necrotic 18 points of damage  matt all righty  taliesin and ill take another shot with bad news  matt go for it  taliesin 20 to hit  matt 20 does not hit  taliesin all right  matt second shot just goes wide firing off into the distance over the city of westruun  taliesin all right turns up  matt all right pike youre up  ashley okay im going to guiding bolt  sam be beautiful be good 
none	  laura at what level  ashley im going to at third let me see this  liam is this an attack range thing or does it automatically  matt spell attack roll so you roll  ashley and then i add that that would be a 29  matt 29 damn what did you roll  ashley i rolled a 19  matt thats nice thatll hit  ashley okay so now i do  laura 4d6 plus two more d6  ashley 26  matt 26 points of damage  ashley yeah  matt all right and the 
none	 next attack against it has advantage so pike youre staying you popped  out of the trench and youre up on the ground you hit it with the guiding bolt you can see the  blast of divine energy streaks up and slams into umbrasyls side the darkened black scales now  have this shining beacon across the torso anything else you want to do with your turn or is  that it you want to move  ashley yeah im going to stay  matt all right  ashley but im also going to put a spiritual weapon just

none	  matt transmute rock  marisha its a 120foot range  matt yes and a 40foot cube in the range so what are you doing  marisha i want to do the area just directly under umbrasyl if i can so that im not sinking the  herd around him  matt turning what into what  marisha i want to turn the ground directly underneath umbrasyl into mud  matt okay the only piece of rock is the piece of rock that you put beneath where the chains were  there the area right beneath umbrasyl is dirt its 
none	 earth  marisha okay i thought it had spread because its 40foot so i thought it was under umbrasyl  but i could do something else  matt a 40foot cube part of it would be under umbrasyl possibly but for the placement of where  you put that its going to be hard for you to do it without it pulling everybody else into it  marisha okay plan b  matt you can do it still but itll probably take some of the herd with it  marisha should i go with pillars yeah ill go with  
none	 sam no  marisha no  liam just do what youre going to do ignore the gnome go  marisha okay im going to cast bones of the earth which i think i can pop up six pillars  around umbrasyl  matt okay  marisha so grog you want a boost you want to stand on a rock  travis yeah  marisha pike you want a boost do you want a boost  ashley yes  marisha okay heres what im going to do i want a pillar here grog when youre ready  matt all right so

none	 his wing no  marisha so flanking this pillar on the other side over there if that makes flanking this pillar  so wait move that one that you just placed over a bit  matt this is like a summoning spell  marisha you know its fine you get the idea  matt that one there  marisha lets do one up here  matt you have one more  marisha knock him in the chin  matt okay  marisha hopefully that contains him a bit  matt all righty that finish your turn  marisha yeah guess 
none	 so  matt all right that brings us to scanlan  sam okay here we go  liam here we go  sam i turn to my little buddy and i say are you ready for a ride little man  liam highpitched come on big guy  sam before we go i yell as loud as i can to pike to inspire her with my bonus action first  matt the range pike is quite far away  sam cant hear me or it wont work  matt whats the range i think its 60 feet so yeah shes

none	 stomach may be  sam okay why not  laura is it advantage because i told him where it would be  sam nope 12  liam can i give him my luck  matt laughs no  sam its just intelligence right theres no other  matt right you add your intelligence modifier to it  sam yeah its two  matt you would add two to that because of your bardic ability plus two to any skill check  sam okay 14 then  ashley is there anything extra from heroes feast no  matt no so both 
none	 of you grab hands and vanish the darkness that hits your eyes upon vanishing  doesnt go away as darkness still hits you all of a sudden you are plunged into a thick wet  crushing interior you have finished your dimension door spell you are in darkness you are  being crushed between what feels like two layers of musculature both of you  sam hi dude  matt you dont know where each other are you dont see the other person theres no sight you  cant hear anything  sam are we touching at all  matt 
none	 nope the trajectory of the spell and the unfortunate circumstance put you guys on two  different sides of a membrane and you dont know where you are  sam its going great  matt all right does that end your turn  sam yeah thats all ill use my movement to go  matt you are both considered restrained so your speed becomes zero attack rolls against you have  advantage you have disadvantage on dexterity saving throws also you suffer eight points of  acid damage reduced to four  sam awesome  liam whos got the other 
none	 gatestone i have one  ashley oh i have one  liam 60 seconds  matt you also both currently have no air at the top of this round umbrasyl goes disgruntled noises  liam suck it bitch  matt i will eat all of you  liam im a twofoottall rogue you motherfucker  laura im up  matt youre up first top of the round  laura oh my god okay im going to cast conjure animals and im going to conjure two giant eagles  right in front of his face  matt im really hoping we 
none	 can put more things on the battlefield guys i think that would be a  cool idea  laura laughs sorry matt  matt its not like i dont have enough to concentrate on up there  laura im sorry  matt its fine i dont have two giant eagle miniatures so well say for the time being this  air elemental is a giant eagle  laura okay  liam ill say with no facetiousness this is all i ever wanted in my life  sam to be trapped in the spleen of a dragon with me  matt 
none	 well say these are up in the air  laura okay right in front of  matt because ive used all the height things for  laura and conjure animals is an action or a  matt its an action  laura okay im going to tell them to attack his eyes  matt okay  laura they get their own  matt own initiative which i just rolled whats their dexterity bonus  laura you sent me a thing lets go with that hold up giant eagle dexterity is 17 plus three  matt so it would be plus 
none	 three that puts them at 11 so they are just above keyleth and vax all right  laura and then for my bonus action im going to i cant cast two spells even if ones a  bonus action  matt as long as its a level two or lower  laura oh okay for my bonus action im going to hide a lot im going to hide  matt you didnt start the round hidden so you cant do that  laura i wasnt still hidden  matt no you have to spend a bonus action to attempt to 
none	 hide at the end of your turn  laura can i attempt to hide  matt youd have to be a level two rogue to do that as a bonus action on your turn  laura but on my boots of haste i can use it to dash disengage or hide  matt oh youre using your bonus action so your extra action not your bonus action  laura okay my extra action  matt you can do that yes go ahead and roll a stealth check  laura natural 20  matt you vanish into the foliage  ashley 
none	 yeah  matt all right great finishing your turn the herd now goes theyre going to attempt to put the  rest of the chains up to increase the dc of the grapple there we go so four more chains get  latched on so theyre holding each chain increases the dc of the grapple all right so as  theyre all holding it down the five in the back that are going to take attacks on it are going to  do so thats a hit miss miss hit miss miss miss miss miss hit three hits so four 
none	 damage  five damage and eight damage  laura wow these guys hit real hard how come they were hitting us so hard  matt theyre rolling really terrible they get two attacks each all right and with that the  tribal druid is going to cast blight on the creature however it does make its saving throw  so for the purposes of speed on this im going to use my dicerolling app thats a lot of dice to  roll that comes to 18 points of necrotic damage that brings us to the end of that round grog 
none	  youre up  travis could i go into a frenzied rage  matt you may  travis excellent im on top of a pillar and im not within striking distance right  matt you can hit it  travis from up there  matt yeah its pretty tall  travis laughs i would like to use all three of my attacks against his backside reckless  matt okay  travis natural 20  matt all righty  travis 26  matt hits  travis these are just regular theyre not great weapon master 23  matt hits  travis 
none	 sweet so the first one was the crit  matt the crit so go ahead and roll damage on that plus two additional d12s  travis right thats a d12 21 and two additional d12s  matt yep 21 plus  travis ten 31  matt 31  travis seven so 38  matt 38 points of damage on the first strike next two strikes roll for it  travis that was awful 13  matt 13 all right last one  travis that was also pretty crap thats 16  matt 16 okay at the end of its turn 
none	 its going to use a legendary action to attempt to wing  attack you its going to cost its last  travis oh i did not add the necrotic  matt go for it  travis on all three of them three six eight  matt total of eight  travis total of eight  matt all right expending two of its actions to use a wing attack its going to go ahead and  start beating its wings as hard as it can even with the chains amongst it each creature within  50 feet of the dragon must 
none	 succeed on a dc 23 dexterity saving throw make a dex save  travis singing i believe i can fly  matt the only one of the party within what did you roll  travis a nine  matt nine all right you take 15 points of bludgeoning damage  travis reduced to  matt reduced to eight go ahead and make one more dexterity saving throw just for my own sake  travis 16  matt 16 you are thrust off the pillar pushed falling and hitting the ground prone on the  ground the pillar remains there you 
none	 take an additional eight points of bludgeoning damage  reduced to four from the impact but you are knocked prone the rest of the herd here well  say for the sake of that they do not save oh man they are all knocked prone knocking much of  the chains free from their hands as theyre thrown onto their backs then it is still technically  grappled so it cannot fly half its speed unfortunately it does seem to have knocked a  majority of the chains off its back percy youre up  taliesin holding my action until 
none	 its action  matt okay that brings us to noja nojas going to attempt another lightning bolt its the best  thing he has at the moment oh a natural 20 on the saving throw nope not bad 15 points of  lightning damage to umbrasyl nojas then going to dart back behind the tree ending nojas turn it  is now umbrasyls turn umbrasyl is going to go ahead and attempt to break free of the final  chains that are there  taliesin with disadvantage  matt correct with disadvantage but even so comes out to a 22 
none	 crash the rest of the chains  that were holding umbrasyl down break free  laura what about the trap is he out of the trap then too  matt well the trap thats currently holding it in place is part of the whole setup the trap is  whats keeping it there starting the grapple and the chains are just there to increase the dc so  with that the actual metal structure of the trap that held it in place is shattered you can see  pieces of iron go flying wood splintering in this cloud of dust 
none	 that is kicked up from the movement  of the wings currently right now there are still hooks and chains dangling from umbrasyl but some  of them have broken and most of them are unmanned at the moment the dragon is going to  wings flapping go ahead and  taliesin can i take my action  matt you can yes  taliesin im taking a shot at him at the joint at his wing and im going to attempt to ground him  matt attempt to ground him okay go for it roll for the attack  taliesin 
none	 natural fucking 20  cheering  taliesin oh no oh my god right now  marisha hes taking a photo  travis hes taking a photo  taliesin photo taken ha natural 20 it still doesnt necessarily mean hes grounded it means  he has to make a strength saving throw or hes prone  matt correct so roll the damage first  taliesin roll damage oh yeah thats double dice so thats 23 points doubled is 46 plus  matt plus the modifier so 46 is  taliesin 46 yeah plus the modifier now is 52 points of damage 
none	 total  liam that bullet came from the center of the pacific ocean  matt strength saving throw  taliesin i rolled really well  matt thats amazing all right so strength saving throw to try and resist the effect that is  a failure its going to use one of its legendary actions to automatically succeed one of its  legendary resistances so succeeds rising up from the ground because of all the guys that are  knocked prone  taliesin wait  matt what was that  taliesin i was going to pop off a couple more shots 
none	  matt you held your action okay so you fired loaded fired last round  taliesin i was going to blow an action surge  matt oh its weird to do out of turn action it is a little strange to do that  taliesin okay  matt he held his action thats something you do on your turn as a burst ill say probably have  to wait on your actual turn to do that full bit  taliesin no its okay go ahead  matt umbrasyl does rise up about 40 feet  liam here we go scanlan 
none	  matt its actually going to move back this way  ashley did he never land on the glyph  matt he landed in the trap immediately and the trap set off but he never grabbed the stuff  ashley it was if he landed on it  matt you said it was to  liam pull it off  travis yeah we said to lift it off  matt all right flying back at that point flapping wings just growling absolute anger  squeezed in its insides you guys both feel this heavy contraction within its body as you 
none	 guys  watch this flow of greenish bile spittle begins to fill up and spray out in a line from its mouth  liam look at all those people  laura are they all going to die  matt everything there okay  laura the birds were up in the air though  matt right but the stream sprays down its not just a single bolt it vomits it out and it lands  over everything thats how it works  sam pike are you in there  travis no  matt all right that comes to 15d8 acid damage 
none	  laura 15d8  sam i think a lot of those people will be fine  matt so thats 81 points of damage to all those guys they all just dissolve in horrible agony  laura oh my god you guys were going to die  sam no just me and liam  both of the eagles just screech in pain as theyre entirely ruined  laura good job you fucking wastes of space they didnt even get to fucking go  matt sorry thats going to end umbrasyl the hopedevourers turn  marisha the hopedevourer  matt that is 
none	 the full name  sam so his middle name is the hope and his last name is devourer  matt devourer married into it  sam its hyphenated  matt hyphenated yeah  travis marriage fucked everything up  marisha yep umbrasyl the hope and then marriage fucked everything up  matt you guys have both entirely vanished you both are inside the entity all right so  keyleth the line just stops right before you it smacks into the ground five feet from your feet  and you watch as the earth and grass beneath you just immediately turns 
none	 black and seems to almost  coalesce into this deathsludge in this long line it just barely misses you all right thats going  to end umbrasyls turn pike youre up  ashley all right so im going to guiding bolt him again  matt all right youre now up on a pillar facing this giant flying dragon standing above the rest  of the battlefield your shield up and your frostbrand to the side you reach up and grab your  holy symbol and go ahead and roll for your guiding bolt attack  travis how high is he 
none	  matt 30 feet he went back  ashley 28  matt 28 hits  travis fuck him up pike  marisha come on pike can you bring him down any  ashley im rolling what again sorry  laura what level are you casting it at  ashley four again  matt how many 4thlevel spells do you have left now because you cast  ashley i have two more  matt two more because you cast death ward which is 4thlevel i believe right on scanlan  liam well what did you do you did death ward and 
none	 is that it  ashley the last guiding bolt  laura yeah so thats only two you used  matt right so you have how many more left at 4thlevel  ashley two because the ring gives me one extra  matt all right so go ahead and roll that that is going to be 4d how much do you get guiding  bolt damage on that then  laura 4d6 plus an additional two or three  ashley at fourth level that would be seven then  matt that would be 7d6 radiant damage  ashley 22  matt 
none	 22 points of damage  ashley but ill also never mind were good 22  matt youre good okay  ashley and then im going to move my spiritual weapon  matt okay spiritual weapon which is technically on the ground over here  ashley and im going to move it to the back of his neck  matt lets see spiritual weapon can move it 20 feet and repeat the attack  it is more than 20 feet away  ashley okay  matt its down there so it can begin to shift upward in that direction so well 
none	 say that its  partway floating in midair  ashley can it get his feet  matt no it cant its too far away unfortunately  ashley all right well itll start working its way up there  matt okay that ends your turn pike all right it would be the eagles turn but they got  dissolved  laura thanks matt thank you for pointing that back out  matt oh i like to i also want to point out that you guys held my dragon to the ground for two  rounds and hit it like a goddamn 
none	 pincushion  liam youll feel better once scanlan and i have dissolved  matt i will all right end of pikes turn vax youre up first at the top of your round  liam im just going to take the dragon blade and im going to as best as i can drag it in front of me  matt okay  liam im going to cut the insides of this  matt first you take eight points of bludgeoning damage as it is crushing you muscles tensing on  the inside are just youre in between musculature right now and 
none	 just being crushed  liam yes probably its sphincter now what  matt you are restrained so go ahead and make your attack at disadvantage  liam at disadvantage  laura but it cant very well avoid it  matt its about him being able to actually move and get it  liam well im using the dragon longsword which ive never used before its a plus one sword so i get what  matt plus one to hit  liam with strength  matt it would be strength but weve agreed that it can work as finesse for the 
none	 purposes of a dex  bonus you just cant sneak attack  liam i just cant sneak attack all right so  matt be grateful im being  liam whatever you want to do you are the deity here so this is a 17 to hit  matt 17 you pull the blade and its just unable to cut through this tense muscle and tendon  liam use luck  matt okay  liam nothing  ashley wait what is this is this an attack  matt hes trying from the inside  ashley can i cast war gods blessing 
none	  matt does war gods blessing require you to see the creature  ashley probably not  matt well find out  sam yeah probably  travis probably not  matt when a creature within 30 feet makes an attack roll so using the guiding bolt you can  see shifting somewhere in the body of umbrasyl laughs you see this form moving in there you  know based on what you guys have discussed before i hope you discussed this plan before  liam we discussed it so much  matt thats a plus ten bonus is that what 
none	 it is  ashley plus ten  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage with the longsword  marisha is this sneak attack  matt no he doesnt get sneak attack with a long blade  travis but against dragons it does specific damage  liam yeah it does plus 3d6 if i remember  matt let me look it up here just to be safe  liam 15 from the inside  matt 15 damage from the inside  liam hopefully that cuts me a little breathing room and a question that only you know  matthew  
none	 matt the extra is 3d6 you are correct  liam am i within five feet of scanlan  taliesin an extra 3d6 not just 3d6  liam i got 15 damage am i within id like to use my bonus action to sneak attack if i can if  im within five feet if scanlan is within five feet of the creature thats up to you i dont  know its crazy circumstance  matt the reason that you would get sneak attack for having another creature within five feet is  because it is harrying and the opponent is 
none	 distracted  liam the heartburn is not distracting it  matt not enough  liam not enough okay  matt theres not a lot of threat to umbrasyl  laura you get a d8 plus your d6  liam yes i know i did it  laura then you did the additional 3d6  liam i did darling  laura and you only got 15  liam i only got 15 i would like to use the dagger to cut into him as well  matt all right go for it disadvantage on that attack  liam disadvantage  matt 
none	 yes  liam oh thats no good thats nah its 12  matt you cant even get your dagger out of the sheath its too tight in there you are cutting  through muscle and you feel the body and the muscle just tense based on the reaction of the  interior pain you watch the dragon but its still keeping up in the air  liam im okay okay  matt you are beginning to suffocate  liam all right  sam oh jesus  matt i mean you can hold your breath for a little while here but 
none	 just letting you know  there is no airflow youre not suffocating yet but you know there is no air to breathe  currently  liam i understand matthew im fucked its fine  matt all right thats your turn that brings us to keyleth  marisha im so scared okay hang on what the hell is the range on that im going to just take  a few steps forward hereish matt  matt right there  marisha thereish move up a little bit just so i can yeah just ahead of the tree and im  going to 
none	 attempt to cast earthbind on him he has to make a strength saving throw  matt strength saving throw that is a failure its going to use its second legendary resistance  succeeds  marisha fuck i knew it well weve burned off two of his legendary resistances  liam also i have no idea what the initiative order is but fassbender keeps doing slow until i  tell him to do something else right  matt if it recharges go ahead and roll a d6  liam a d6  matt yes  liam two  matt two it 
none	 does not recharge slow fassbender is too low fassbender is just standing there now  marisha okay im going to take the remaining of my turn oh shit i actually didnt want to move  its okay im going to turn into an earth elemental  matt okay all right  marisha and im going to take the remaining of my movement to move up  matt up  marisha well he has 60 feet of movement but i moved what like ten feet earlier so  matt 60 feet of movement his speed is 60  marisha no im 
none	 sorry his earthglide is yes 30 so he moves up 20 feet  matt 20 feet all right that finishes your turn keyleth scanlan youre up actually at the end  of keyleths turn its going to use a legendary action to use a tail attack against you pike  because you are within 20 feet of it as its in the air its tail whips out toward you that is a  32 to hit  laughter  ashley yeah nope no doesnt hit  matt you take 22 points of bludgeoning damage  ashley and im staying up 
none	 there  matt youre barely holding on up there but yes you take the brunt of it with your shield and it  almost knocks you off the side you manage to take your sword and dig in to the opposite side and  catch yourself on the edge of the pillar it does not knock you off scanlan it is now your turn  at the top of your turn you take six points of acid damage reduced to three as youve found  your way into the stomach he did not  sam is it big in there 
none	  matt its fairly spacious but its all squeezed together right now its not a giant empty void  its not a giant pocket of air in your stomach it is a  liam click motherfucker click  matt youre also holding your breath you are also submerged in liquid that is dissolving you  sam i can move my arms though  matt you can youre still pressed in but you can move your hands yeah  sam okay thats good im going to get that rod out and click it  matt laughs okay pulling out this is 
none	 going to be weird all right so you take out the  immovable rod and click it and as you release it it stays there aloft in the center you have  darkvision as a gnome correct  sam yes  matt right so there in this space amongst the murky liquid you can just barely see its shape  there and it is held aloft yes  sam okay thats good thats positive guys were getting somewhere is that my movement is  that my bonus what is that  matt no thats your action to pull it out 
none	 and click it because its not easy to do in your  current circumstance  sam sure okay well i guess thats my action and i guess as a bonus action i cant really do  anything laughs i cant inspire anyone because i dont think i can hear oh im going to use  the earring shit fuck im going to just start screaming and say can you hear me vax  matt you guys hear through the earring incoherent highpitched babbling the air has  now escaped your lungs  sam fuck  matt youre not drowning yet 
none	 that ends your turn vex youre up  laura do i get advantage on attacking it because of guiding bolt  matt you do the next attack yes  sam did vax reply  matt yeah the guiding bolt because the guiding bolts technically the next attack it did not  give you advantage on the attack because youre on the inside and you dont actually see the  guiding bolt it would go over to the next one  liam i dont know what the fucks going on matt its fine  laura ive got to see because i 
none	 just want to know how far does grasping vine go do you know  keyleth  marisha 60 feet i can tell you super fast no 30 feet  laura how high in the air is  matt he is 30 feet up right now  marisha you technically have a pillar thats 30 feet high adjacent to him that you can anchor it  into a pillar  laura im going to can it go from the bottom of the pillar up towards him  matt if you want to down here you mean  laura yeah i want 
none	 to try to grasp onto one of his legs and yank him back down towards the  ground ooh which would really hurt with the immovable rod inside of him  matt okay all right so using your bonus action you conjure the vine as your one 4thlevel spell  laura i have two because i have a pearl of power  matt oh so you wouldve had to have prepared that in advance but yes well say you do  laura okay oh i didnt tell you i should have  matt you should have told me but well 
none	 say as part of the preparation you did that okay so  grasping vine appears lashes out from this pillar up at umbrasyl  laura yeah  matt all right the creature has to succeed on a dexterity saving throw or be pulled whats the  dc on your spell  laura um 16  matt 16 that is a nine plus nine that is 18 so the vine whips out and umbrasyl backs up and pulls  the leg up and it just hits the air beneath kicks away the vine  laura that was my bonus  matt 
none	 yeah  laura okay then im going to attack him three times with my hasting  matt go for it yeah three attacks  laura all right  matt first one has advantage  laura okay 24  matt 24 hits  laura okay and thats sneak attack because hes got somebody close to him inside of him  matt its technically not sneak attack its not so much about theres somebody close but a  person that is not threatening him from his current physical space it is a bit of heartburn  for him right now you dont 
none	 sneak attack somebody from eating bad pasta  laura cool then just seven  sam did he move  matt not yet no so how much damage is that  laura ten  matt ten points of damage for the first attack  laura for the first attack  matt second attack this does not have advantage only the first one did what was your first roll  laura then it doesnt hit then 26 for the last one  matt 26 hits so the first one hits sticks part in the front of its armor doesnt seem to phase 
none	  it the second one it actually hits the wing and the wing just shatters it and knocks it out of the  air as its keeping itself up the third one however does strike and hit and itll actually go  between the scales of the neck roll for damage  laura nine  matt nine points of damage both arrows sticking out of the hardened exterior of the ancient black  dragon  laura the grasping vine just still hangs out there  matt yeah its just chilling on the side there as long as you maintain concentration 
none	 itll stay  travis is it grabbing him or not  matt it failed with the grab all right end of your turn is that what youre doing  laura am i hiding still  matt you have to use a bonus action to try and hide if you began the turn hiding or you can use  your extra action from the haste to do it but you already used it to attack so youre not hidden  laura ugh fine  matt laughs end of your turn its going to use another legendary action to do another tail 
none	 attack  against you pike  travis is that the third one  matt that is a natural one umbrasyl goes to swing and suddenly theres a pulse in the stomach  as you see vax moving once again on the inside and doing so distracts it and the tail just swings  overhead and you duck below it as it just barely misses your head by inches one of your braids  actually comes loose from the amount of wind that blows by that brings us to  travis whats left of the herd  matt herds turn  
none	 travis come on goliaths and herd please roll better  matt he is going to rush up around here grab the chains that they can the chains have broken so  theyre going to go ahead as part of their plan to begin to just unleash weaponry so they just run through  marisha have they all broken maybe some just came loose  matt this was their plan the plan they agreed to theyre all taking out javelins now they had  them at their side theyre all leaping up towards it  laura are they just the stupidest 
none	 goliaths that theyre all clumping together again  liam thats redundant  laura these guys are dumb  matt youve met  travis scholars the lot youre going to pay for that later by the way  matt all right so theyre all going to take javelin shots at miss miss two miss hit  hit three hits and so theyre all just effort sounds chucking these javelins upward four  eight thats 12 plus seven 19 points of damage from the javelins as some stick in then fall out the  wounds are now becoming visible umbrasyls theres visible 
none	 wounding but doesnt appear to be  in dire straits or anything grog youre up  travis yes i have two questions one of the things i picked up from kevdak were four enchanted  javelins what do those do  matt theyre thrown ranged attacks  travis and theyre just enchanted  matt theyre plus one to hit and damage  travis just that  matt thats it yeah its a relatively simple enchantment  travis what is my climbing speed if my natural speed is 50 and i wanted to climb that column  whats the climbing speed 
none	  matt climbing speed i mean if you roll a decent climb check here that would be id say that  would be an athletics check to see if you can climb it and id put it at about half speed but  youre also prone so getting up from thats half your speed  travis on my back can i use my bonus action to drink the potion of speed which makes me hasted  matt yes you can you now have technically four attacks per round  travis i do and it doubles my speed right  matt 
none	 yes  travis okay so i have 100 feet so can i stand up  matt yep 50 feet  travis can i try and climb that column towards umbrasyls feet  matt athletics check  travis thats not awesome 18  matt 18 you just manage to get to the top with the last bit of your movement so you are up about  ten feet from umbrasyl right now pushing on 15 at an angle  travis so i have four attacks  matt yes youre not in melee though  travis yeah so ill use three of 
none	 the enchanted javelins and the javelin of lightning  matt okay all right so you effort sounds finally with the javelin of lightning so go ahead  and make the first three strikes  travis reckless all of them  matt okay so with advantage on each of these the range on the javelin strikes im just going  to pull it up real fast since this is the first time youve used this  travis yeah its 120 feet for the javelin of lightning  matt yeah within 30foot range so its fine go ahead and roll first one 
none	 is  travis its an 11 plus just my natural like  matt its 11 plus one for being enchanted  travis right  matt plus your strength modifier and your proficiency modifier  travis oh no my proficiency  matt which is plus seven i believe plus so yeah that hits  travis okay wheres my proficiency oh five i got it  matt yeah youre looking at plus 13 with these attacks the first one hits  travis okay  matt second one  travis is 28  matt hits third one  travis is 19  matt 
none	 misses the lightning javelin you just throw and i think it hits  travis and the second one the last one is a 30  matt the last one i dont think you actually roll to hit with the javelin it just becomes a  bolt of lightning  travis thats right  matt so roll 1d6 plus eight for damage on two of those javelins  travis so thats 12  matt all right  travis 14  matt all righty and now with the javelin of lightning makes its save that is a 21 with the  save 
none	 whats the dc  travis 17  matt 17 so it takes the half damage  travis okay  matt whats the damage on it total  travis 4d6  matt go ahead and roll that and he takes half damage  travis 13  matt 13 all righty so 13 and then halved  travis six  matt six points of lightning damage okay the last hit the javelin turns into a bolt of  lightning and streaks through hits and impacts and then just falls to the ground the energy  expended jamming itself into the dirt not 
none	 far from the ground end of your turn grog percy  youre up  taliesin okay my first shot taking a wing shot  matt all right go for it  taliesin thats 20 that does not hit  matt 20 it just ricochets off the armor  taliesin all right thats one grit taking another shot  matt okay reload and then shot again  taliesin that hits 30  matt 30 hits go ahead and roll damage  taliesin 15 points of damage and he has to make a strength saving throw  matt strength saving throw that

none	 right ending your turn percy noja is going to use the third and final lightning  bolt now arcing up to the entity makes its save with a 27 all right bringing us to 8d6 13  points of lightning damage against umbrasyl from noja and noja steps back behind looking  exasperated and spent on some of the upperechelon spells at his disposal now it comes to  actually at the end of nojas turn umbrasyls going to use its last legendary action to make one  more tail swipe at you grog  travis yup  matt that 
none	 is going to be a 29 to hit  travis yeah  matt all righty you take thats really bad thats 11 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to five  travis i stay up  matt yeah you stay up  loud clanging sound from skype  matt whats happening over there  liam taliesin  matt all right top of umbrasyls turn see if this recharges umbrasyl is going to attempt to  move to the left  liam yeah try it buddy internal damage  sam the rod supports 8000 pounds of pressure  matt correct if the 
none	 creature pushes against it it must make a dc 30 strength check to move the  rod up to ten feet in a single round so nope  liam that things fixed in space  matt it goes to move and grunts and is feeling something tear through on the inside of its area  so it stops with this sharp pain takes one point of damage but the warning is there it does not  move however laughs the acid breath did recharge on a five its going to go ahead and go  right there angrily lay down 
none	 right there  laura no  ashley no  liam but youre resistant  taliesin isnt he having plummeting issues if hes not moving  matt no if your speed is zero you plummet is how it works  taliesin okay  matt no they all fail all right they are all right over here wrecked wrecked wrecked  wrecked  laura wheres zanror  matt zanrors right there at the bottom  laura wheres his wife  matt his wife is over here and when i say wrecked theyre on the ground their flesh  dissolving and screaming in 
none	 pain the herd has been heavily culled in but a few rounds theres a  little bit of horror to it i need both grog and keyleth as an earth elemental to make a dexterity  saving throw  travis 16  marisha i rolled a two with a minus one so one not a natural one rolled a two  matt you both suffer 82 points of acid damage  marisha okay  travis resistance so i halve that  matt yeah you take 41 points of acid damage  marisha im in tank mode so im good im

none	 streaks across and more sparks fly but  this time you can see it left a carve of glowing red mark across the scales where the blade managed  to do some damage to it that ends your turn pike vax youre up you immediately take eight  points of bludgeoning damage as it begins to crush you from the inside  liam okay im going to use my bonus action to can i sneak attack this thing from inside im  inside him thats very surprising  matt its different its not like a soft gooey center all of 
none	 its body is still very dense  sinewy muscle in the vicinity you dont know where you are in its body so you dont know where  the actual weak points are so given those circumstances your ability to barely move  probably not  liam probably not all right well im going to use my bonus action first to hit it its at  disadvantage  matt yes all attacks because youre still restrained  liam okay so that is 19 which fucks up  matt that unfortunately is not cutting through  liam and now im going to 
none	 use the dragon sword okay thats a 21  matt 21 just barely not able to cut through the dense hide the blade is caught on what feels like  a ligament or something it cant quite carve through with your body all crushed up inside  liam well i will for my turn suffocate and also fassbender should still be trying to  recharge  matt correct so go ahead and roll a d6  liam d6 four  matt four fassbenders still standing there on a five or six it recharges that ends vaxs turn  keyleth youre

none	 strength as an earth elemental if you do not have a specific skill for it  marisha im going to use scanlans inspiration ooh thats good 18 plus five so 23  matt 23 you manage to leap and catch the bottom of its foot  cheering  matt youre not halting or doing anything to umbrasyl other than the fact that youre holding  on to  marisha but ive got his foot and im heavy as fuck well if fassbender weighs what was it  like 1200 pounds 2800 pounds  matt yeah  marisha so im at 
none	 least as heavy if not heavier than fassbender  marisha a ton is 1000 pounds right  matt 2000  marisha 2000 pounds  laura i thought a ton was 3000 pounds  marisha none of us fucking know why didnt we go metric  matt the european watchers are like  marisha yeah what are they talking about okay im holding on for dear life  matt all right that ends your turn scanlan youre up  sam i know from my experience going to the pubs with grog  matt take eight points of acid damage by the

none	 sam hows my lungs am i dying here  matt your air is out youre still holding your breath per se but you have one more round before  you actually probably start  liam i would like to say that liam obrien whos a total wusspuss can hold his breath for like 50  seconds  sam while youre screaming  liam so vax and scanlan should be  matt youre doing okay he screamed and released all the air out of his lungs so hes now  completely collapsed lungs no air to subsist on  sam im 
none	 almost out im going to see if i can last one more round in here  matt okay what are you doing laughs  sam well as i was saying i know from my time drinking with grog that any sort of blow to the  stomach will really make you barf pretty easily so im going to set off a thunderwave at level six  and hope that he spits me up  ashley spits you both up maybe  liam im still in its anus  travis we dont even know where you are really  sam youre

none	 through theres this gasp  sound so yes there is a moment of air that is pushed back out you can see upwards a brief  little glimpse of light at the top of the esophagus as the mouth is forced open as the air  is pulled in and the blast streaks out angrily scanlan is that your turn  sam i cant do much else do i have any movement  matt you are restrained so your movement is zero  sam even in the water im in a womblike state  matt youre not like floating in 
none	 a giant pool of water youre crushed against membranes with acid  remember the scene in akira when tetsuo gets too big and the girl gets crushed briefly youre in  that middle period right there youre between two folds of stomach lining and there is just acid all  around its awesome  sam all right then i cant really do much oh shit no i wouldve had to call it earlier never mind  ashley what  liam i just want to remind everyone i am really small i fit between muscles bones ligaments  anything  sam
