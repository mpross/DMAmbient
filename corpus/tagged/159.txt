none	 laughing  matt and welcome back to tonights episode so picking up where we left off vox machina  having to find and collect the artifacts known as the vestiges of divergence to prepare themselves  for battle against the chroma conclave a group of extremely dangerous chromatic dragons who are  wreaking havoc on the taldorei countryside and get vengeance for the loss of vex and vaxs  father in the past er sorry mother the fathers still around and kind of a dick  laura yeah  matt its been a long week however you guys have been 
none	 making your way into the feywild in  search of a specific item known as fenthras a bow of which vex has been sort of keeping an  eye on this whole time  laura ahh totally  matt just like that laughs were all having gen con plague residual here theyve made their  way through a number of strange dangerous and awkward encounters in the feywild including  an encounter with their father i meant to say earlier in syngorn which is currently hiding out  in the feywild until theyve prepared for battle against thordak the cinder 
none	 king you went to the  moonbrush and parleyed between pixies and werewolves you pushed past the gilded run  a series of enchanted dangerous rivers that keep the shademirk bog in check from spreading across  the land with its corruption and you stepped into the shademirk bog its strange sludgey black  corrupt interior stumbling upon what appears to be a small hovel built out of a tree trunk  the gnomes making their way towards via vexs broom caught a partial glimpse of the creature  that lived within a door was suddenly opened and upon floating 
none	 back the broom was robbed of  its magical enchantment temporarily the party regathered and are now deciding what to do here in  the depths of the shademirk bog so as the gnomes have returned your broom has seemingly been  proven to still function  laura dont say seemingly  matt why its fun  laura dont say seemingly  matt its fun  marisha we confirmed  laura yeah  matt what would you guys like to do  sam all right so that place over there the hut  laura yeah  sam i think it 
none	 was not a good idea to go over there i think its one of the things that  whatshisfuck warned us about  laura garmelie  sam yes  laura the hag right  sam i dont know i wasnt really paying attention  laura yeah no he warned us about  taliesin im feeling the hag is anybody else feeling the hag  sam something about a hut  laura i am not feeling the hag  liam im not feeling the hag  marisha how do you mean yeah how do you mean feeling  liam ive had 
none	 enough hag  taliesin were not feeling the hag but i think we should avoid her  laura the hut of wodenna  marisha the hut of wodenna right  sam yeah thats probably wodenna  laura it could be  sam so why dont we go around the hut is that possible is garmelie gone  laura garmelies gone  matt garmelie left you guys  sam oh yeah  travis peaced out  matt he wouldnt even enter the forest with you  laura however she is aware of our presence now isnt she  sam so were 
none	 big and scary shes a little old lady  liam whats the terrain like around this hut  matt the forests of the shademirk bog is a very very thickly wooded swamp with thicktrunked trees  and almost weeping willowtype sagging canopies but the entirety of each piece of brush here is  coated and seemingly seeping this kind of black sticky tarlike ichor that just kind of pools and  seeps into the ground so even traversing this territorys been a slow arduous process  there is a small clearing around where this tree trunk hovel is currently located 
none	 and the tree  itself does not appear to match the surrounding trees  that kind of embody most of this forest terrain  liam does it look possible to skirt around it from where we are  matt you could skirt around it most definitely yeah its just something you saw in the distance  and went and inspected you could avoid it entirely  liam okay  taliesin and we do have a direction to move  laura yeah we know we know that is not where the bow is  marisha yes it was on garmelies list 
none	 of things to avoid  sam but maybe she could help us in a way  laura i know its so terrible i want to like explore everything here because  marisha i wonder if she knows the other hags that weve encountered  laura forsythia  sam its like that urge when youre standing at the edge of a cliff like part of your body wants  to jump a little bit  laura yeah  sam i kinda wanna go in there  laura kind of like when i dove into the river  sam yeah yeah yeah 
none	  matt yeah exactly  marisha well see you guys did kind of jump and it didnt feel good right  laura right true  travis devils advocate  marisha so  travis what if shes lonely and two what if shes not the hag and she knows where the hag is  marisha one im certain she is lonely and two shes probably the hag  taliesin im pretty sure shes the hag  marisha shes definitely probably the hag  liam weve kind of already had this conversation before we went and poked a badger with those  
none	 floating instruments we really dont need to do every single thing  laura no we dont we really dont  travis im just saying youre profiling is all  liam and i have a bad history with hags and i would like  laura yes you do  liam to skip this fucking place  taliesin im okay with that i honestly i could use a bit of sleep at some point and i think  moving in the correct direction getting a bit of sleep somewhere safe  laura and weve been dosidoing the whole time weve been having 
none	 this conversation definitely  taliesin im working on that as well  marisha i feel like were trying to talk ourselves out of this arent we  laura i think we need to not go towards the hut  marisha okay well not go towards the hut  laura to the tree to scariness  taliesin if there was a time to not be us this is the moment  marisha its probably now  laura this is that time  taliesin right now  travis i take out the javelin of lightning  all no  sam you have 
none	 a javelin of lightning  laura he does  travis i do  taliesin he does in fact have a javelin of lightning  sam why have you never used a javelin of lightning  laura he has he has one time dont  travis and i i just make sure that its clean and put it back  matt okay  laura lets just sneakily go off and just not pay any more attention to this charming little tree  marisha okay  taliesin i feel like weve done enough damage for one day  travis yeah weve gotta 
none	 at least come back this way so you know  laura this is true ugh  matt all righty you guys  travis we go around stealthily  laura stealthily walk away from the hut  travis do we still have pass without a trace  laura do we still have pass without a trace going or do i needno it dropped it dropped  matt you traveled quite a while yeah  laura because we fought something so i would need to cast it again which i do cast again  pass without a trace  sam thank you 
none	  laura um maybe dust of tracelessness behind us so the hag  doesnt feel tempted to maybe follow in our footsteps  travis dont tell me what to do devilwoman  travis i take out the dust of tracelessness it looks good i put it back  laura grog please flowergirl please  travis javelin or dust of tracelessness they go together if i do one i do the other  laura youre terrible thats terrible  travis i need a little danger in my life  taliesin i promise you were going to kill something very soon  
none	 laura soon  travis theres a giant werewolf following us  laura we just killed the crocodile plant we just killed a crocodile plant  marisha thats true  laura seriously we just fought something  marisha you were inside his gut you have to remember that  laura just did that  travis i didnt really hit it that much it was very unsatisfying  all laugh  laura lets walk away  laura i wanna stealth  matt all right everyone make a stealth check  marisha all right new d20  laura oh high hopes  travis 
none	 did you say pass without a trace  laura pass without a trace i cast pass without a trace  taliesin huh thats weird  marisha thats a dick move that is a  taliesin thats weird  laura did you get a 20 did you get a 20 on it  taliesin i got a 19  laura aw  marisha he got a 19 and i got a three  laura oh come on  all laugh  laura thats just not cool  matt thats actually pretty funny  sam thats one better than before  matt

none	 ten  liam no i didnt we use  laura and travis pass without a trace  matt pass without a trace was used  liam i just oh all right  laura and matt you said dust of tracelessness  liam oh 37  matt lotta traces going on its fine plus ten added so 37  laura 36  matt 36  marisha 20  taliesin 35  sam 30  matt all right and pike  laura pike  matt all right  all laugh  matt ehhh natural three its okay you guys make your way 
none	 around the outskirts of this kind of  open glade area scooting by as you begin to separate finally getting to a point where the  direction youre trying to head where you noticed seemingly all the liquid thats seeping from  the actual movement momentum of the horrible black material was like pushing slowly outward  from apparently some center place you follow that slow flow best you can as you begin to pull away  you hear a slight creak sound in the distance creaking  laura no can we see if the door shut  travis hide 
none	 i hide  laura did the door shut  matt perception check  liam yeah perception  laura um 25  matt you look back over your shoulder and notice the door just creaking bang and closes  laura okay  travis fuck  laura no thats  matt as it closes  travis shes out here now  matt theres a sudden flash of wind and theres a flicker in pikes form as all of a  sudden she flickering sound  laura no  pike guys  matt and her divine form vanishes in place apparently sent back 
none	 to the source of where she  projected her essence  laura she didnt get like stolen or something  liam that is never not unsettling  laura away  matt uh not to your knowledge its similar to the previous times that shes been unable to keep  her form there for you especially between planes you can imagine its been rather difficult for  her to be here for the time she has  laura maybe the hag cast a dispell she did on the broom  marisha yeah dispell magic  taliesin or maybe things just got 
none	 strange  marisha poor reception  sam something i said  laura love you pike  travis something you said laughs  laura definitely something you said  marisha okay  matt all right  marisha can we see the hag moving inside the hut through the window  matt you make a perception check as youre glancing that way  travis can i look for ukurat  matt perception check  marisha oh my god  laura seriously  marisha 14  matt 14 you see movement on the inside but no actual physical bead on an entity  
none	 you just see the light being broken in the window  laura okay so shes  marisha yeah shes inside  laura thats good  travis a gigantic 11  sam youve yet to break single digits with them  taliesin new die  matt you barely notice anything beyond the trees you have to remind yourself oh theres a house  there but  laura laughs  travis that sounds accurate  matt yeah  travis who are these people like gasps  laura keyleth what direction was the big scary blight on the land  marisha northeast  
none	 sam northwest  matt northwest  marisha northwest northwest  laura so we head that direction  marisha this direction  matt all right laughs  marisha this direction  matt following keyleths lead you guys begin to slowly make your way through this bog and  laura keep an eye out for anything moving  matt everythings slowly moving in its own right this kind of sludgey sound  laura shit  travis easy there tiger  matt sliding of awful liquid  laura anything seemingly aggressive  matt understood  travis dont shoot any trees  matt as 
none	 you kind of push further further northward you guys are having  do you have to sneeze  laura it went away  matt okay good you get the sensation its not even a sensation the rest of the party   aside from you you guys are getting kneedeep in this liquid now and its to the point where  youre having to take one step lurch it out of the liquid onto another and youre having to go  out of your way to kind of hug the edges of trees where the roots themselves are protruding to 
none	 give  yourself some kind of foothold as opposed to getting stuck in this bog you scanlan  are having a particularly rough time trying to walk on your own because with each though with  your light form its a lot of strength to even pull your  little feet out of this tarlike substance so  travis yeah pimpsalot you wanna  sam absolutely  travis okay  travis can i pick him up and its black stuff right  matt yeah  travis can i smell the black stuff on him  matt yeah i mean it 
none	 permeates the area but its particularly strong at his feet and lower  extremities almost went up to his upper thighs it is a it smells like a combination of wet  blacktop sulfur and compost decay  travis yeah in the summer  matt yeah like a hot hot florida compost yeah  travis i know that exact accurate smell  matt yeah its delightful  sam drakkar  travis you smell terrible  sam sorry  laura thats a lot coming from grog  sam that is true  travis how about you ill put you on my 
none	 shoulder but how about you sit on my shoulder  like strapped back there and just hang out the back  sam sit on your shoulder straps  travis no dont put your feet near my face like hang out on the back of me  sam all right all right thank you for the lift  travis no worries  laura its good you can keep an eye out for the hag following behind us  sam thats good  sam wait am i like being yodacarried right now  all laugh  laura yes  travis im flipping 
none	 and climbing vines and shit  marisha oh man that makes me want a scanlan backpack oh man  matt okay as you guys push on forward keyleth guiding the direction youre the only  one who moves without an issue are you tracking ahead of the party or are you staying with them  laura i am tracking a little bit ahead of them  matt all right you travel for about another hour or so forward and you just being naturally alert  as you are notice some shift of movement that is more sudden than the slow 
none	 sway of some of the  various branches and boughs of nearby trees a little bit in the direction youre traveling  and to the left  laura what did it look like just movement  matt it moves again and you see what appears to be some almost large rocklike figure thats  shifting and the more you take a moment to focus it looks like a humanoidtype creature hunched  over facing away from you  laura mouthing we should go we should go that way  laura can i point everybody to go around keeping a wide 
none	 berth  matt okay  travis lead the way  laura percy look over there with your eyesight look through  your little scope and see what you see  taliesin im gonna try and scope it  matt okay make a perception check with advantage  taliesin ugh could be worse 16  laura oh  matt okay you um you take a moment and kind of train on this movement you now see there are two  figures that are facing each other and they themselves are covered in this horrible liquid  and you recognize the form 
none	 a little bit these theyre humanoid but they have long  exaggerated jaws very long forearm limbs tall straggly black hair long pointed hooked nose  and theyre both eating something thats partially stuck in this bog these are trolls  these are two large trolls that are currently in the process of eating some sort of creature  taliesin a pair of trolls  laura whispering we need to be very quiet  matt youve had a piece of troll in your bag for a while  laura oh  travis oh yeah troll dick  laura so weve 
none	 killed them before thats good to know  travis yeah theyre huge  matt trolls are pretty big  laura they were  traivs about how big are they  matt like id say even with the hunch nine feet tall  laura yeah just you know maybe go around  sam yes we should go around  laura what do you think  sam we could kill them quite easily  travis yeah  laura well theres two of them that we see  taliesin that we see  travis hey percy  liam theyre stupid arent they  
none	 laura didnt wait  marisha i dont know  laura didnt tiberius turn into a ladytroll  taliesin that was a thing yes  marisha that happened  laura oh  marisha to be fair also everything in the feywild  sam what  marisha  has been more sensitive defensive and more intelligent  laura they could be smarter  taliesin they could be smart trolls  laura they could be like hag trolls which is just terrifying  taliesin theyre eating something thats stuck  laura which could be us very soon  taliesin which could be us 
none	 very soon  laura we need to keep moving  taliesin lets keep moving  laura the longer we stand still the more stuck we get  matt you hear this grunt in the distance and you now looking through your scope  you see that one of them has looked up from its eating its mouth covered in all sorts of shiny  fresh liquid and it kind of glances past its eyes the pupils are white against yellow  eyes so it has this very kind of flash across a cats face type gleam across the eyeballs  
none	 they kind of grunts  liam can we all see this  matt yeah you guys can see since youve all made note of these creatures in the distance  liam why dont we back it up slow for once  laura well how about we dont move at all right now  marisha everybody freeze  matt turns around trollish grunt says something to the other one they both grab a big  chunk of whatever theyre eating jam it in their mouth and then dive down into the muck  sam oh shit  laura can we get 
none	 up in the trees  matt if youd like to try and climb them  laura can we try and climb the trees  taliesin were going to try and climb a tree  sam to what end then were just gonna sit here forever  taliesin for a minute  laura well no we can go from tree branch to tree branch are they tightly enough connected that we  can travel on the top of the trees  matt possibly might require some jumping  sam i am a backpack right now  laura im gonna get on 
none	 the broom and fly up  matt you fly up  liam ill climb after her  matt okay go ahead and make an athletics check if you dont mind vax  travis im not scared of trolls  liam 18  sam could you be please  matt it takes you a minute but you manage to get up to the tree you come up into the trees  do you break the canopy or do you stop up at the branches  laura i wanted to yeah sure ill break the canopy  matt okay as youre climbing 
none	 up your sister actually goes past where the branches leaves  and the top of the trees end before you can really kind of speak out to question she  disappears you vex come shooting up off the top out and you can see now before you the shademirk  in its entirety kind of wrapping around the base of this one mountain that kind of comes up into  two sharp peaks like horns on some sort of a large debased devil but its just a formless rock  mold that comes up into those two peaks looking around 
none	 you you can see the trees are  very very dense and heavily packed together and what immediately catches your eye is about  two three miles ahead right towards where the base of the mountain seems to sink into the  shademirk there is one very very large tree that stands above the rest of them  laura oh shit why didnt i go above the canopy before  marisha is it to the northwest  matt it is what would be considered to the northwest of you it whereas the rest of the  shademirk continues to this 
none	 relative 20 30foottall canopy this tree probably goes  up about a hundredplus feet and the branches string outward and have long strands and vines  dangling from them its this is a massive example of local flora and fauna  laura wow okay i say i see the tree and i come back down into the canopy  matt okay  laura can i come down and grab keyleth and lift her up into the tree too  matt sure  marisha ooh  travis how high are the lowest branches  matt the lowest branches are about seven 
none	 feet up  travis you wanna lift  sam im just a passenger im on you if youre not going up im staying on you  travis im not going up  laura youre not gonna go up in the tree  sam were gonna  travis you think my giant ass is gonna jump frockilyfuckyfucky from branch to branch in the  treetops like some kind of acrobat  laura i dont know  travis no no  sam were standing our muck  marisha well okay is what were trying to do figure out a way to not 
none	 have to walk in the muck  laura yeah i think so  marisha youre  laura i feel like the trolls are gonna pop up like somewhere near us  travis can i put my back against a tree  matt yeah  travis a large tree  matt yeah the nearest tree the one that vax actually climbed up is the one thats closest to  you guys and its close enough for you to just take a fivefoot step back up into it  sam im back here im back here im back here im back here 
none	  laura youre against the tree  travis i turn around the trees talk  sam its me dont back up into a tree  travis i spin around again and put my back to this tree  sam im still back here im still back here  travis oh  laura while thats going on can i fly down and get percy out of the muck  and bring him up into the tree  matt sure  liam im gonna chime in over the earring and say somebody could turn grog into a marmoset or  something that 
none	 would work for the circumstances  laura oh shit  marisha thats what i was gonna say i can always polymorph you for a moment grog  travis i might be down with being some kind of monkey  marisha you want to be a monkey yeah what kind of monkey  travis gorilla  marisha okay  laura oh shit  marisha and i turn grog into a gorilla  matt and with that grogs already pretty large form just grows smaller and hairier  travis nimble as shit  laura what the fuck i should get scanlan  
none	 matt you look down at yourself and kind of marveling at your hands which havent changed too  much other than the place some of the fingers and thumbs you already have pretty big strong  hands but you also pull up one of your feet from the muck and you can see the additional appendage  that you now have in the prehensile toes  laura grog get in the tree get in the tree  taliesin i dont see a change im not sure  travis no  laura tree  travis no  laura please  travis 
none	 grog  laura aw  sam also has the mind of an ape  matt yep  laura seriously  matt yeah  marisha which might be more intelligent than what he was before  matt actually lets  travis ah shit  matt lets have a look what the  travis gorillas cant  matt lets see lets pull up the monster manual here and see exactly what were working with  laura gorillas are pretty fucking smart  taliesin yeah you have one dont you  marisha i think i do  laura i think theyd be smarter 
none	 than grog  marisha i do but i dont have it in my little book  laura they can learn sign language they have like an entire yeah  liam strongjaws kitten  laura oh  matt all right well go with the stats for an ape cause thats whats here and available  they do have intelligence of six so you are as intelligent as you were before  all laugh  travis but i do this with my foot  all laugh  marisha looks good on you grog  travis im gonna can i  matt no 
none	 you cant talk  travis gorilla noises  laura shit scanlan do you want to ride on grogs back still  or do you want to come up in the tree  sam no i dont  travis gorilla noises  marisha ooh youd be like a little silverback baby  laura can i go down and grab scanlan and put him on the broom with me  matt sure  laura okay  sam thank you  liam honestly i cant even tell the difference  travis that still translates right  matt yeah  marisha okay i know

none	 worked really well last time totally somebody can  marisha give it to your brother hes trustworthy right right right vax  laura he had the carpet before so maybe not so much but the whole point was for the trolls to  not have us on the ground the trolls but  marisha oh right thats true  laura can we just try to travel amongst the trees  taliesin lets see what happens  sam stick to the plan  marisha im gonna go ahead im gonna use a beastshape and im gonna go into an eagle form 
none	  matt okay giant eagle all right beastshape is taken hes gorillafied  you have scanlan up on your broom  laura yes  matt and then vax and percy are you just traveling through the canopy  laura shit  matt or are you carrying somebody keyleth  laura do you wanna carry scanlan  marisha i can carry scanlan  matt okay  liam how thick are the trees here  laura i feel like we could  matt they range anywhere from between five feet and  liam i had such a hard time when i flew 
none	 up the other day such a hard time  laura yeah  liam and everyones just floating up easy as pie  marisha to be fair ive been flying a lot longer than you have vax  laura thats true and your wings are much larger than hers were  marisha its true  liam yeah  laura yeah and ive got a skinny little broom so im not flapping any wings  liam im skinnier than your broom  laura yes well  marisha laughs  liam lets do it  taliesin all right  matt all right  
none	 laura then i guess i can take one of you on the broom with me  taliesin take him ill be fine im gonna i have a potion of climbing  laura do you wanna hop on this since you have no flight  marisha ooh potion of climbing nice  laura brother  marisha all right i fly over to scanlan  liam no but i will anyway  sam im with you now  marisha eagle sound  laura all right hes on the broom with me  matt all right so the twins are on the broom 
none	 they go up grog you just have a field day  leaping through those branches and just coasting through keeping an eye best you can on the  guiding broom above the actual tree canopy you go ahead and  grab scanlan as well and follow suit  matt as soon as you break up as well you can see the large tree in the distance percy doing the  best you can to keep an eye on grog or at least listen to that regard you drink your potion of  climbing and begin leaping off and kind of 
none	 ninjascattering your way through the higher  branches of the trees as well  travis anime shit  taliesin oh yeah  matt so if i can go ahead and get grog and percy to go ahead and make three successive athletics  checks if you could  taliesin with advantage  matt this would be for you it would be advantage yeah  travis whats the modifier for king of the apes  matt you know what ill give you advantage on this just cause youre an ape  taliesin athletics or acrobatics  matt um for the purposes 
none	 of climbing and grabbing  i would say this is more of an athletics check  taliesin okay  matt since this is more upperbody strength and  laura not parkouring not parkouring through the treetops  taliesin thatll do  travis thats a 20 12 plus eight  taliesin 16  matt all righty  travis 21  taliesin 24  matt all righty last one  travis not so great 23  taliesin natural 20  matt all righty to your surprise as the potion energy surges through your body even with the  relatively slick surface that 
none	 a lot of these branches and trees have you have an innate  ability to point out which ones are the strongest easiest to grab a hold and just keep the momentum  going in the semblance of a parkourlike leapandgrabtype circumstance you have managed  to move through almost with the grace of the gorilla ahead of you you lose sight a few times  but you guys do take the better part of the next forty minutes or so to eventually make your way  closer and closer to the tree where the shadow the shade of it 
none	 against the permanently dusk sun  now begins to creep over the place you are in the forest you have now entered a shaded nightfall by  the actual trees location and placement the lower forest below you is pitchblack at this  point other than a little bit of light that filters in from nearby lit areas of the forest  audible feedback  laura oh  matt oh  laura oh  sam theres a punk band warming up  all laugh  matt never ends there we go you guys make your way towards are you going 
none	 straight for the tree  or are you  laura okay do we wanna go straight for the tree now  or do we wanna like rest up before we do that  taliesin i think we want to observe it and rest up  liam observe yes  marisha like scout  laura watch it and see whats going on with it  liam yes  laura before we just go straight to it  travis we dont have the mansion right  sam we have the mansion  taliesin we do we have the mansion  travis gorilla 
none	 noise  sam how many hours since weve slept last  matt id say its probably been surmising six to seven  taliesin really its been since the river  matt yeah  laura yeah  sam so we can at least do some we can get closer and do some recon  laura yeah  liam lets do recon lets observe it for the next six to ten hours  and then rest up in the shag  laura thats a long time all right  marisha i go ahead and i take off with scanlan and do kind 
none	 of  a high aerial loop around the tree  sam worried noise  matt all righty  laura oh jeez around the tree around it  marisha just at the top really high really high getting nice  laura i wanna kind of perch on top of a tree nearby and just kind of see it from there  marisha watch  taliesin i want to see if i can find the source of the bog muck  matt okay you both make a perception check from being up in the tree  sam wait tre oh  marisha 
none	 do i have advantage because im an eagle  matt well it would be  sam above the tree yeah yeah yeah  marisha dont eagles have advantage  sam eight  all laugh  marisha i do have advantage  sam just cause  marisha okay  matt eagle eyes  marisha eagle eyes 27  matt 27 as you coast around the outside of this gargantuan tree you can see there are a number of  places where the branches meet and where elements of the bark are slightly split and there is just  a slow perpetual 
none	 flow of this black tarlike substance youve seen it on smaller scales  seeping from the trees in this actual forest its like the entirety of the landscape is kind  of creating this but the bulk of it whether it be the source of the general corruption or at  least is the largest central location of its source there are a number of places throughout  this tree where its just seeping out like sap  marisha like sap  laura like bleeding out oil  matt out of the actual tree  marisha like even the top 
none	 of the tree and stuff  liam like evil maple syrup  marisha evil maple syrup yeah  laura mm sounds tasty can  travis like ghostbusters  laura  we see any kind of movement any kind of things moving around the tree  matt you dont see anything moving around the tree at the moment other than just the gentle  swaying as a little bit of wind hits the sides of it portions of its long hundreds and hundreds of  hanging vines just kind of slowly get moved and tangled by the windfall if you want 
none	 to make a  perception check as well  laura okay that would be 30  matt okay  liam i got a natural 20 using luck  matt great so the two twins up there on the broom as you kind of glance around the other  side you both can see the branches themselves occasionally will shift and curl up almost like  an arm recoiling and then relax slowly back out again  like a stretching arm held still for too long  laura oh shit i think the tree is alive and not in a normal 
none	 plant sort of way  liam yeah  laura yeah  matt you also notice some of the vines that are wrapped around and kind of curled around these  branches as well occasionally recoil and pull in and shift and move up its like theres a whole  ecosystem based around numerous forms of plant life that cause this thing  to almost act like a giant organism  laura fuck i do not wanna get close to that thing  marisha i know thats intimidating  liam im gonna rest my chin on my sisters shoulder and just 
none	 stare for a minute and say  you know that bow is going to be reeeally cool  laura god i hope so  liam yeah worth it  marisha still on my back scanlan you wanna get closer  sam im using my eight perception i report to the others its just a normal tree guys  all laugh  sam nothing out of the ordinary no movement nothing its safe  laura thanks scanlan your eyes your eyes  travis can i check myself for parasites  matt you find a number of them actually theyre delicious  
none	 all laugh  matt for the two of you that are below the treeline you dont get a grand view above  its too hard to see but you guys make your way close to the actual base of the tree  laura ugh no what the base of the fucking tree  liam no no  laura no fucking way dont do that  taliesin im gonna get close enough to at least make out some detail  marisha and ill do kind of a tighter loop around it  matt okay  marisha see if i can get 
none	 any more details  matt all right percy you have to get pretty close to even get a view because of the density of  the trees the closer you get to this so you guys are probably going to have to get within 20  30 feet to get a view of the exterior of the large tree  liam thats a bad idea  laura yeah can we see him walking towards it  matt no you have no view of them this high in the canopy  laura fuck  matt theyre below the treeline percy as 
none	 you get closer you begin to notice that the  actual roots of the tree almost come 10 feet up before they merge with  the outside of the tree itself a number of  taliesin is it a solid trunk or is it like a combined trunk  matt its a solid trunk in most of its places but there are swaths of vines that wrap around it  and curl and create these giant tight nets almost like a rat king of tails across certain  portions of its exterior near the base and where some of  
none	 the roots join with the central tree trunk  taliesin im gonna back up and try and find a place to scan the ground  find a place to put a door for our mansion  matt okay  taliesin safe  matt okay i mean there are a number of areas that are somewhat clear on the ground but there  is no all the landscape is coated with this molassestype material even the bits that arent  submerged and are relatively shallow there is still that substance all across them  marisha i was doing a tighter loop 
none	  matt right  marisha of the tree see if i can get any more details that we havent already seen  matt okay keeping your eyes out as best you can as you loop around a second time you get closer  no real change in what youre able to observe you have a higher detailed look at it but once  again you see a number of these vineclusters around the base of some of these branches  you see elements where the bark has split and sealed over and split again  and just spills out more 
none	 of this black filth  marisha okay  matt you arent able to make out any sort of other details about its surface  marisha i fly back to the others  matt okay  laura percy  taliesin yes  laura are you on the ground  taliesin no but im close to it  laura do you see any sort of animal life around the tree  taliesin nothing no  laura the only thing ive seen is actual branches moving like arms i think the trees alive  taliesin if i were animal life i would live 
none	 beneath the surface  laura like the trolls  taliesin like the trolls i think theres quite possibly things that live in the muck  probably not on top of it  laura do you guys think maybe we should um we should get in the mansion and have a nice  little chat and figure out what the fuck were gonna do  sam sure sounds good to me  travis how do i not become a gorilla anymore  laura yeah  liam yeah we want to be at full strength  matt you dont  marisha its 
none	 up to me  liam dont run in willynilly  travis i look at keyleth and i go  matt she doesnt see you cause shes way above the trees and youre just kind of down in the  forest as a gorilla going  travis im on the ground  matt youre not on the ground youre up in the actual tree top  sam while we still have a ill phone down to vex and vax and percy and say while we still have a  giant eagle is there any point to us to me and kiki 
none	 scanning back to where those trolls were and  just making sure theyre not following us or anything  taliesin no although if you find a log approximately two feet thick  i could certainly use that  sam a log  taliesin a log about two feet thick  laura about how long though  taliesin doesnt matter  laura you wanna fly down we fly down i take the broom and try to find a log  liam yeah youre in control  laura all right  matt all right so the two of you kind of make 
none	 a perception check  laura laughs yeah  liam seventeen  laura thats interesting i got fifteen  matt okay uh  liam what a lackluster okay  laura yeah okay  matt it takes you guys the better part of an hour to finally find a piece of abandoned dead tree  husk from which youll be able to carve a piece that  matches the description of what  percys requesting  laura all right  matt requires some cleaning it is very thick with the actual tar but you do manage to bring it  back to 
none	 him a little larger than what you wanted but it can be carved down  taliesin its fine ive got a thought so im gonna try something  marisha i drop grogs polymorph and my eagle form  sam screams as though falling  marisha after ive landed  sam oh okay  matt okay you are back to your regular grog self  travis my pants are down as my hand was behind my bottom just contemplating flinging some poo  matt all right and in that brief moment all of a sudden you are well some of your 
none	 sense have come  to you not much else has changed other than your physicality but  travis hi guys  laura hi grog  liam i think a little bit actually got out buddy  laura gross come on  travis it didnt dont worry  laura so foul  matt all right so youve all managed to reconvene a little ways off from the base of this  large tree what do you wish to do  sam should we  laura singing mansion it up  sam yeah  taliesin i could use some sleep and ive 
none	 got a little thing to work on for the moment  sam okay  liam what are you doing with this log percival what is this for  marisha is this what we were talking about that time  taliesin swamp shoes  marisha swamp shoes  laura swamp shoes  taliesin i think some swamp shoes might not be a terrible idea  marisha i can help you with those  taliesin thank you swamp shoes  laura so you can walk like me  taliesin yes i mean not quickly it wont help you walk quickly its not 
none	 necessarily the most  stealthy thing on earth but you wont drop two feet into the muck every time you take a step  laura thats good  travis ive got a question can one of us that can turn into things go in the muck  laura oh  taliesin maybe  laura i feel like is it bad do we get any kind of bad vibe bad energy off the muck  sam other than it being black magic  matt roll an insight check  taliesin the muck is unhappy to be there  marisha that mud 
none	 looked at me the wrong way  laura no but i mean what if it makes us sad to be around it  taliesin it does make us sad to be around it  laura nineteen nineteen  matt those are some nice boots youre wearing youre probably gonna have to get a new pair when  all this is over it stinks its sticky the muck itself is probably not a very nice  conversationalist it doesnt also from what you can tell appear to be sentient or give you any  kind of bad vibe that you can 
none	 pick up  laura okay  taliesin its just muck  matt from looking at it it is muck  travis i mean ill go in and  marisha i can go  travis yeah  laura stankystank  matt stankystank  marisha sounds fun  travis what are you gonna turn into  marisha something that burrows i guess i technically couldve taken a short rest correct  matt not yet no  taliesin we havent yet  sam so were doing this now  marisha in the time were just chilling okay well ill take a short rest 
none	  taliesin lets take a long rest i mean  sam well no i  marisha i just want to take a short rest just  matt a short rest is about half an hour or so half an hour to an hour  marisha yeah just enough time and then im gonna  turn into an earth elemental and im gonna swan dive  sam wait wait  laura swan dive  matt well get to that because as you take your short rest and  begin sitting amongst the ground or the bough of the trees  marisha 
none	 i thought we were in the mansion  matt no the mansion hasnt been cast yet  marisha oh  matt so as youre resting here amongst the tree tops  laura were in the tree tops  matt yeah the branches begin to sag ever so slowly  laura shit  matt and particularly keyleth and percy actually grog as well you begin to feel the  branches slowly almost trying to push you off them like you sort of slide forward  marisha did i say something i dont know  taliesin no you didnt say anything  
none	 laura trees youre so lovely even though youre covered in this black stuff i can tell that you  have really good personalities  marisha youve clearly been moisturizing  travis you really dont think thats  matt all the branches begin to slowly sag down  laura shit i push off were flying were hovering  matt and you guys all begin to slide down  taliesin im going to make a jump to another tree  marisha yeah i do the same  matt okay make an athletics check both of you  sam i will too  
none	 laura what about you grog  marisha oh my god this is horrifying  taliesin oh my god  travis all right ill try  marisha ten  taliesin my potion has worn off hasnt it  matt at this point in time how long does it last  taliesin one hour  matt yeah  travis i frenzy raged last time  matt yeah so you have disadvantage  sam youre dead sir  laura oh no  travis dont worry about it  laura oh my god you rolled 19 twice in a row  travis yeah 19 
none	 and 16  laura oh okay  travis 24  matt okay so you leap onto another tree branch  sam i got a 23  matt you also leap after and actually land next to grog  sam hey buddy  grog hey pal  matt what did you get percy  taliesin seven  laura oh no  marisha 10  laura oh no  matt you both reach leap for the branch but youre a good foot and a half two feet  short and as your fingers catch the edge  marisha percy catch me  
none	 matt its slick and both of you go plummeting about 15 feet to the ground you both suffer four  points of falling damage as you catch yourself on the ground kind of jamming your ankles a little  bit theres a splash of liquid as you impact and the lower patch goes partway up your calf  almost to your knee as you hit and you have to wiggle to try and  taliesin i want the mansion now  sam okay  laura can we drop the endless rope down say hey grab on  matt yeah  
none	 laura and try to yank em back up into the tree  matt okay you guys take the rope and begin to pull yourself up  you feel your branch begin to slowly  laura oh i was on the broom  matt youre still on the broom this whole time  laura ive been on the broom yeah i dont wanna stand on anything  matt all right then you manage to get the rope down you guys grab onto the rope and you pull  them ever so slowly out of the muck its a lot of weight 
none	 i need you to make a strength check  laura can i tie the rope off on a branch  taliesin it wont hold  liam can i help  matt sure sure we can do that you dont need a strength check to tie the rope off well just  take it you guys manage to pull yourselves at least out of the muck however youve gotta climb  up the rope to try and get back in the branches  taliesin im just gonna hold on  laura we just need to get in the fucking mansion  
none	 taliesin we just need to get in the mansion  marisha yeah can we have the mansion  sam okay ill do the mansion  marisha i mean we can still come in and out of the mansion  sam yeah thats true thats true  matt all right  sam i will cast the mansion i will sing the song to conjure it  sings home home on the range where the trees are acting real strange  where chickens are pecked  vex shoots me in the neck  and the hot tub is filled with grenades  
none	 all laugh and applaud  matt well done  travis im sick dont make me laugh that hard  matt all right with that scanlan after leaping onto the next branch you create the doorway into  the mansion up in the trees you guys all slowly eventually climb back up and get to where the  entrance is and each member of vox machina currently present leap into the mansion  to safety where its seemingly much more clean though  you are dragging clumps of this liquid on the main carpet  travis thats good  taliesin its 
none	 fine  sam i command my servants to wipe our feet  travis whoa whoa whoa im sure you want to test the gunk right percy  laura yeah we should  sam oh go out and test it  travis is it flammable is it poisonous is it acidic  marisha i take my fire hands and i see if i can light the gunk on fire  matt okay as you bring it near the gunk does not burn you see one little pssh as a bubble  bursts and there is a little burst of sulfurous flame 
none	 but it burns away in an instant the actual  liquid itself does not catch  marisha okay i start taking my short rest  matt all right  laura should one of us lick it  taliesin sure  sam grog  travis i take a pinkysmear  liam give it to mikey hell try anything  travis like a droplet right i stick my tongue out and i touch it to my tongue  matt it resembles and its only familiar to you because youve tried this before its like  tasting the filthiest copper coin youve ever 
none	 held in a pocket before it has that kind of metallic  residue to it but also this kind of earthy griminess where its probably been devoured and  digested by a number of creatures before it found its way  laura ew  travis i detect a note of digestive tract  matt it is not pleasant by any means  laura do you feel evil more than usual  travis i raise my hand no  laura okay  taliesin give me a little bit and ill do something to it i dont really know what i can 
none	  tell you but ill take a look  laura hold out your hand then  taliesin thank you i need that tree as well lets take that down to want to help me with  this before your nap or after  marisha i dunno after  taliesin all right ill start on it then you can help when you finish  matt all right so you guys begin  taliesin im gonna go work for a little bit  matt okay what are the rest of you doing  liam im gonna hobble past vex and say you 
none	 know i think that broom is not as wellsuited for um  men i think you might have done gern a favor ive just taken a very long spin class  i sort of tenderly walk past  laura well i have a seat sorry i didnt think about  liam oh dear  matt so vax goes to rest his bruised arch  all laugh  marisha is that enough time  matt youre making those  taliesin im gonna make swamp shoes  matt okay thats gonna take you  taliesin theyre very simple but yes i have 
none	 to make a lot of them  matt you have to make a pair for most everybody here  taliesin and im going to be enlisting her help its literally just thin slices im not making  them super nice im just  marisha i druidcraft the shit out of those  taliesin yeah im gonna have her  laura im gonna come out of the door with you  taliesin thats pretty much what im doing other than sleeping  matt okay go ahead and make four tinkering checks  sam im gonna inspire him once with an inspirational 
none	 quote  you have to look through the rain to see the rainbow  all laugh  travis i gotta leave i cant  taliesin i have to take a negative 10 for that like that really removes 10  marisha did you get that from a fortune cookie whered you get that  travis i cant be here when this happens  sam hey pal life is what happens when youre making other plans  if plan a doesnt work theres still 25 letters left in the alphabet  laura oh wow  travis oh my god  laura 
none	 thats three inspirations youve just given him  taliesin lets burn that page  matt thats borderline lisa frank quotes here this is  liam kill him  taliesin can i remove that extra two from your charisma im gonna wipe it out  matt yeah all that reading finally goes to shit  sam it was my footprints you saw  taliesin its proficiency bonus plus dex  matt yes go for it  sam i was carrying you all along  taliesin i hate you i hate everything that you stand for oh this is nice this is 
none	 um  matt remember you dont have to use the inspiration dice if you dont want to  taliesin its two 26s  matt okay  taliesin im keeping the inspiration dice and lets see and two 19s  matt all righty yeah you guys take the better part of the next hour to make some loosely  functional swamp shoes theyll get you a short distance theyre not gonna last you a long time  taliesin theyre not pretty theyre made of rope  matt yeah all right so you finish your short rest  marisha i really wanna 
none	 swan dive into the muck  laura i feel like keyleth a swan dive is maybe not the best idea because i feel like itll make a  lot of noise maybe nice and quiet  marisha if i tighten my abs and keep my feet together it shouldnt make much noise at all  taliesin youve been watching a lot of olympics  marisha i have been watching a lot of olympics  liam i come back in with a big bag of ice  matt and two spirits trying to hold it for you  travis did we 
none	 take a long rest or just a short rest  laura short rest right now so keyleth can go into the muck  taliesin im going for a full long rest after my crap  laura im gonna go outside with her and just hover on the broom to keep an eye  sam im going out as well and im just sort of shuffling in place and moving  laura do you wanna hang out on the broom with me  sam oh yes that would be better  matt all right so the two of you on the 
none	 broom grog what are you doing  travis im going into the kitchen with the titanstone knuckles  and im gonna start hitting things  laura wow grogs getting aggressive  travis well i wanna see if i can upgrade the knuckles so im gonna start using them  laura oh smart smart  sam i have a training basement but okay sure  taliesin and theres food  matt you guys make your way to the front door in the distance you can hear a series of dull  thuds bangs cracks and various sounds as grog begins to 
none	 just punch his way through the entirety  of your mansions kitchen  laura do you wanna check on that  sam seems like its normal  laura all right  matt you doubt youd ever see a fully dominated spiritual servant look nervous yet at this moment  you have about 17 of them all just going highpitched whine  you just tear through the vicinity  travis yeah  matt youre trying desperately to finish up your short rest as you get up you hear this noise as  well as you guys make your way to the 
none	 front door youre left to try and finish up this project  probably for the next 20 minutes or so while they go ahead and attempt this process  vax youre resting up your loins with ice  liam no i mean im gonna take my bag of ice and im gonna sit on the doorjamb and watch them go  and just see if they need help but ill stay here if i can  matt all right you  laura scanlan do you wanna actually sit on my lap so you dont have to suffer through the  
none	 indignity that vax just did  sam yes that would be lovely thank you  matt all right so as you guys step out keyleth  sam will you tell me a story  laura whatever you want darling  matt keyleth as you step off of the tree branch are you gonna climb down  or just leap down into the muck  marisha i swandive i take a minute to compose myself and then  laura youre earth elemental  marisha as gracefully as possible pull like a pocahontas  and then turn into the earth elemental as 
none	 i dive in  taliesin sail  marisha sail  matt all right as you do your form suddenly ripples and extends out into the form of your  elemental body you slam into the surface and sink down below you guys see a slight burble sound  in the liquid and it leaves this sort of crater of splash that slowly closes up over with no sign  of keyleth now visible on the surface  laura im gonna hand vax the endless rope and say you might just wanna drop that down to the  muck so she 
none	 can get out if she needs it maybe like fish for her  liam yeah i go and i tie one end of it to the heaviest piece  of furniture i can find in the foyer  matt all right no heavy furniture per se but there are a series of large marble pillars  that are loadbearing within the interior and thats probably your best bet so you go  ahead and wrap the rope around that  liam yes i use the swirlywhirly knot  matt great the one that pike taught you from her sailing days 
none	  marisha i start to earthglide breaststroking through the mud under the swamp to the tree  laura to the tree youre going to the tree  marisha im heading towards it  sam wait hold up  matt swimming through the tar itself is a slowing process even as an earth elemental earthgliding  would mean going subterranean to where the actual physical earth and soil is what you can traverse  through the tar is not natural in comparison to your elemental form  so youd have to go beneath the actual bog  marisha how much further 
none	 down is it  matt id say its probably anywhere from three to five feet depending on certain things thats to  get past how much of it has seeped into the ground  marisha okay then i go down  matt okay you go down and you have to get lower the closer you get to it as the actual seep  the actual depth in which this substance seems to have penetrated the dirt gets lower and lower  you begin to move through as you glide in the darkness  sam you know what we shouldve definitely 
none	 tied that rope to her before  laura yeah before she went in yeah yeah yeah  marisha i wanna use my tremorsense too to just be aware  matt yeah every now and then you feel a twitch a large twitch in the ground and you kind of  shouldercharger into what seems to be a large root that is dug into the ground and you start  finding little pockets here and there beneath these roots of that awful tarlike substance that  have just been pushed into the ground like these little tar geodes if you will 
none	 you start feeling  around and finding these large roots that are just a heavy network of chaos beneath the tree  youre now under the tree probably a good 25 30 feet below it  marisha okay if i reach and out touch one of the roots  like just run my hand along it what happens  sam god what is she doing  taliesin youre my hero  matt you run your hand along the root its stiff the surface of the bark itself is a little  rough at the touch yeah  taliesin sorry i 
none	 just love that word  sam dick joke  marisha i move back a little bit kind of getting away from the tree  matt okay glide backward away from that large root that you had run into  marisha do i sense any type of creatures living under here  matt not within your vicinity no  marisha any movement nothing crazy  matt just the occasional shift like a very faint movement thats  rather sudden in certain areas nearby  marisha okay im gonna start making my way back to the mansion  taliesin it was good 
none	 it was good  matt you earthglide back up you guys after waiting a few minutes suddenly emerging from the  bottom of the bog you see keyleths now covered in black tarlike material  her elemental form emerges  marisha ooh like the swamp thing do i look like the swamp thing  matt kinda  marisha thats cool  laura are you okay  marisha rock noises  laura oh right cool  matt she talks it sounds like a slowmoving rockslide rock sounds  laura awesome  taliesin do you speak rock  marisha thats very poetic 
none	 and then i kind of make my way up and drop earth elemental form  matt okay as you drop the form much of the muck just kind of drops off of where the form once was  a little bits still clinging to the bottom of your robes but mostly clean  marisha yeah i think its good i didnt really see much or learn much more than we already knew  laura did you see any creatures around  marisha no creatures  sam did the muck try to eat you  marisha the muck did not try 
none	 to eat me its not as deep as i wouldve thought actually  its only three feet or so deep i do believe that the tree is living though i think its roots  were kind of twitching and moving around  sam but you felt the roots its not an illusion its a real tree  marisha it is a real tree  sam okay  marisha the roots were very turgid  sam hmm what a good word  marisha someone taught that to me earlier  taliesin i feel like a terrible person i think its just 
none	 a great word thats all  matt all right so with her return what are you guys gonna do  travis punching sounds  laura do you wanna go maybe  sam yeah i guess we should go in and see what going on whats cooking in the kitchen  laura okay  matt as you guys rush into the kitchen and looking around you can see now every  cabinets pulled off of its hinges and shattered in half what was a central stone island is now  just a pile of smashed granite  sam damn it  
none	 matt every single possible breakable utensil platter  travis dont forget the holes in the wall  matt oh it is just ruin you see every servant is now on the ground trying to scoop things up  and as soon as they get a handful to go ahead and set it somewhere  just slapped out of their hand by a fist  sam grog what are you doing this is our kitchen and we need to eat dinner here  travis im trying to activate these and they require pain yells  matt with that what was once 
none	 a large black cauldron that was used in soup and other sort of  baselike liquids is now pwang a large heavy ding is now on the inside in the shape of a fist  and its half as useful  laura grog  travis do i notice any difference in the gauntlets  matt make a perception check  travis at disadvantage  laura because youre super tired  matt yes because you havent rested yet  travis one less ten  matt no difference whatsoever  travis maybe i need to hit people  liam i start backing 
none	 away slow  all laugh  taliesin i walk in at this point and im just looking for some chicken  marisha i also walk in scanlan  laura oh youre not an earth elemental anymore  marisha are you remodeling  laura thats too bad  sam i didnt intend to but grog has forgotten that i have a whole training ground downstairs  that he couldve used grog if you need to hit something someone  i can give you a few of the servants  travis would you  sam sure ive got like a hundred of 
none	 them  travis how many  sam you guys dont mind do you  laura wait do they feel pain  matt they all turn to you and kinda go  travis how many can i have  sam have a dozen bakers dozen  travis i go into the next room  taliesin a dozen bakers  travis with the dozen servants  laura go downstairs grog  travis what if a change happens dont you wanna be there  laura all right yeah  liam scanlan does your house unbreak itself if grog breaks it you know if 
none	 it goes away  it poofs and it comes back is all his damage there or does it  travis please grog always leaves his mark  sam the damage i believe ive never seen damage this bad in our place before but i believe it  will reset it goes back to normal at the end  matt well find out  laura we havent looked at the spa since we destroyed it  sam i havent been down to the spa in a while  travis i pick up one of the servants by the head and i 
none	 try and crush his head  laura oh no  matt your fingers pass through its spectral form theres no actual  travis make yourself grabbable  sam you have to try harder grog  matt passes through again  travis fix this you fix this now i will break more stuff  sam i thought that would work honestly  taliesin is keyleth still covered in goop  travis i punched the cow before  laura you did punch a cow  marisha i kinda fwooshed it off  taliesin do you have any left on you  liam 
none	 grog he doesnt want you to know this he told me this the last time you were here  you actually have to do that 33 times before it takes hold so just keep going  travis i grab again i grab again i grab again i grab again  matt as you keep going youre not even sure quite what a 33 is but you just keep going  the servant stands there its kind of loosely formless face other than you can see eyes  a nose and a mouth but the features are very plain and translucent 
none	  just stay wide and staring straight at you  travis fine fine bring me a cow  laura ohh  sam we usually have one cow  matt the servants vanish and come back you hear a familiar dinging  laura no i hated it when you punched the cow  travis no no no  taliesin im going back to my room  travis its time to ring this bell  laura no  travis i beat the shit out of the cow  all groan  laura that is awful i leave i cant watch i go 
town	 and look for chicken  sam before you beat this poor senseless cow  travis its a purple like ethereal cow  matt yeah  laura its still a cow its still a cow dont  travis im gonna rocky ribs the shit out of this cow  liam street fighter it  matt bonus round you take the next half an hour beating the nonliving crap out of this spectral  cow which every impact has a sound hit does not seem to react in pain as much as  distressed mooing theres no physical damage seen upon its 
none	 form it just gets knocked around  laura thats good  sam ive got an idea i can fix this grog i want you to be a satisfied customer lets go  downstairs  travis okay  sam okay i take him downstairs  matt all right  sam i say youre gonna punch me and keep punching me as long as you can all right  travis are you sure  sam and i transform into a triceratops  laura awesome  marisha i go downstairs to watch  travis is this my daybirth or something  sam birthday 
none	 i mean growls  matt yes as you hear the growling creature youve never seen before in your life horns  protruding from the front of its bony armored headpiece its scaled armored body standing before  you massive snorting you just start punching the crap out of it  travis yeah ragepunching  all singing jurassic park theme  sam im gonna fight back a little  matt a little bit all right you guys do begin to scrap back and forth for the next ten minutes  cause it takes ten minutes of solid punching and missing for 
none	 grog to eventually whittle your  triceratops hitpoints down to zero however in the process you do manage to get a bit gored  suffering a total of nine points of piercing damage throughout the entirety of this just  little scrapes and scratches the occasional puncture wound but eventually you get one solid  crack with the gauntlets across his face and the triceratops form shifts back down to a  tiny little scanlan shorthalt  laura dont hit him dont hit him  sam wait wait did it work are your gauntlets better or whatever youre trying to 
none	 do  travis do i feel anything  matt perception check  laura you need to rest so you can perceive things better oh  taliesin can you roll lower  travis i could theres one number lower  all laugh  matt no seeming change whatsoever although no scarring the good thing about the gauntlets is  that theyre powerful enough where all those impacts  dont appear to have scratched or dented the surface  travis no  sam am i okay  matt youre a little sore that last hit did carry over a little bit the 
none	 form didnt absorb  the entirety of the blow you did come back with uh four points of bludgeoning damage to your  chin so youre you know a little bit of blood on the corner of your lip that you can taste  and your jaw is a little sore on the right side  taliesin just for fun while everythings going on im running two passive experiments in my lab  while im working on the shoes  matt sure  marisha oh and i help him finish the shoes by helping druidcraft them  taliesin im leaving 
none	 some of the muck on some chicken that i took from the kitchen to see if it  has any effect on flesh after a long exposure  matt okay  taliesin and then im distilling some to see if i can even  identify anything in there or anything weird  matt all right so what are you guys doing now  travis being disappointed  taliesin do you have to roll for that  matt disadvantage  laura natural 20  all laugh  laura i was saying it but it really happened  taliesin metaphor metaphor  
none	 sam you know what grog you could it might make you feel better if you repaid the favor  ive been meaning to try to upgrade mythcarver  travis yeah come get it come get it  sam all right im gonna do a stab im gonna sing a note and see if this does anything to  mythcarver ill just go sings a note and ill try and jam it through his arm  matt okay you hit up a scale of notes and one note resonates with the blade and the  harmonic resonance kind of causes it 
none	 to shake ever so slightly as it kind of amplifies the sound  go ahead and roll an attack  laura oh my god  sam 18 plus nine  matt that definitely hits go ahead and roll damage  sam uh not much 1d8 three six plus one  ooh nine  matt nine points of damage to you grog as the blade kinda sinks about four inches  through one of your pectoral muscles  travis grunts  sam and i will sing as i withdraw it as well sings a note  matt you pull it out 
none	 and the blade almost vibrates as it does it scatters the blood off of  its surface as you withdraw it from the wound  sam do i notice any change in the weapon  matt it is bloodless  sam damn it  matt no noticeable change  travis nothing  matt nothing  travis youre only gonna do it once  sam but it hurts you  travis nah do one more but like angrysing  sam all right all right one more time ill do some like black sabbathy sort of  heavy metal screaming  matt 
none	 laughs go for it  sam all right  matt take advantage on this one because of your intense singing  sam 18 plus nine  matt all right go ahead and roll damage  laura oh my god  sam ooh yeah thats better  sam and taliesin ooh  sam 15  matt shnk other pectoral muscle now  travis yelps  matt a matching wound this one kind of yelps tickles you a little as it goes a little deeper  and kinda tickles the outside of a lung  sam all right i withdraw and any 
dung	 change  matt as you withdraw it kind of rings with the pullback blood scattered blade is clean  no noticeable change  sam ah damn it all right forget it  travis these things dont work  sam i know these suck  travis what are we doing wrong  sam i dont know wish there was a manual  travis have we looked for instructions is there writing on the titanstone knuckles  matt there are various carvings on it  travis carvings  sam anything on mine  matt there are runes around the base of it 
none	 what languages do you know  sam nothing i know common and gnome  matt yeah you dont recognize it  laura im gonna go up to grog and cast cure wounds at third level  matt okay go for it you can roll that up  laura ten whole points of healing  travis thanks man  marisha i also go ahead and cure myself up  matt okay all right  sam were about to take a rest  marisha eh  matt what else do you guys want to do  travis im gonna long rest now 
none	  taliesin long rest eat some chicken  marisha wait do we have any vague plan wait we plan at dawn  laura well plan tomorrow morning  marisha well plan at dawn  travis well plan at dawn  laura i wanna go upstairs and just open the door and keep an eye out of it for just a little bit  and see what i see out the doorway  matt okay make a perception check  laura oh come on oh um that would be a 15  matt 15 all right how much time do you 
none	 spend out there  laura well at the door  matt yeah  laura how much time can i spend and still get a good rest  matt well i mean you need an eighthour rest for a full nights rest so it depends how much  time you want to push off until you begin taking your rest  laura oh right well how about a couple hours  matt okay first hour seemingly no real change second hour  go ahead and make another perception check  laura 17  matt 17 you do notice a little ways 
none	 off some of the tree brush shifts a little bit  and then you see what looks to be a few trees kind of fwoosh  laura disappear  matt seemingly theres now a hole in the canopy where once was straight canopy  travis what do you think that is  laura i dunno  travis like a giant werewolf maybe  laura a giant werewolf eating an entire tree  travis trees not missing  laura the tree like disappeared  matt there is now a hole in the canopy where there was not previously seemingly the treetops 
none	  that filled that space have kind of moved out of the way  marisha they go straight down  laura oh i bet something was sitting in the tree maybe and was keeping still that could be it  can i look down underneath us and see if the trees are kind of staying put where we are  matt yeah and glancing about nothing is really moving in your vicinity and the area the part of  the canopy that is now missing is a pretty large area  laura it seems bigger than a creature would be 
none	  matt it would probably have been the sudden removal or shift of multiple trees to leave that  opening in the canopy  taliesin all right  laura holy moly  taliesin all right  marisha maybe something has trees on its back and moves  laura wow maybe the hag can just move her hut magically whenever she wants  do you think thats possible  marisha i dont know maybe  laura but the big scary tree thats staying still  matt yeah  marisha was it coming from that direction  matt yeah its still in 
none	 its place  laura what direction was it coming from  matt actually it would be kind of southwest from where you are now  marisha so the direction we came from  matt no you came southeast not the direction where you came from its still maybe a  quartermile to a halfmile from where you currently are so its not on your path per se  travis can i roll some hit dice to heal up  laura all right shit  matt well for a full nights rest youre fully healed  laura i guess i shut 
none	 the door thats creepy  matt all right you close the door  laura i dont know who i would talk to about that can i go find keyleth are you asleep yet  marisha no i dont think so ive been helping percy with his shoes  taliesin yeah were in my room making shoes  matt okay shoes are finished now  laura oh okay so you guys are together  marisha just finished making shoes  laura oh look at those beautiful shoes theyre lovely  marisha yeah they might work  taliesin theyre not but thank 
none	 you  matt theyre pretty rough theyre pretty rough  laura no no those look great  marisha thank you  taliesin rustic very rustic  marisha thank you im proud of them percy  taliesin im proud too  travis your shoes suck  taliesin youre not here  matt he did pop in briefly to just tell you that  laura grog voice those shoes suck  matt and closes the door  sam he did that to everybodys room just in case  matt to cover all his bases  sam hey  matt perfect  laura 
none	 can i sit down  marisha you were supposed to be a bootmaker youre superjudgey  laura oh this is true  taliesin you were a bootmaker thats very true  matt you did start making your own boots yeah  laura that was your very first  travis you didnt ask me to make the boots  laura can i sit down and start playing with the shoes and um ask keyleth do you know of  anything that would cause entire trees to vanish  marisha how do you mean vanish  laura well i was staring at 
none	 the door and all of a sudden around a space  about three trees just disappeared  marisha like something really large passed in front of it  laura no like they dropped and theres a hole in the canopy  taliesin huh  marisha thats different  taliesin thats interesting  laura do you know of anything that would cause that  travis in the feywild  marisha do i know of anything that would cause that can i roll a nature check or something  matt roll a nature check  marisha dont fucking fail me  laura 
none	 would we have learned anything about that in our studies  marisha yells wordlessly  sam wow those dice  laura maybe just dont use them anymore  travis dont know who you pissed off  marisha 14  matt 14  laura theyre so nice and maybe just put them on display  maybe put them in a really pretty glass case  matt no make em work for you make em work for you you paid for that shit  laura turn em into jewelry  matt i mean there are a number of things that couldve done 
none	 it whether it be lumbering  people chopping down trees takes them down creatures that are large can push over trees  trees that are dying and rotting and eventually fall over on their own  laura did it look like they dropped down though or did it look like they dropped over  matt its hard to know from this perspective you just saw them kind of fall out of the canopy  so youre not sure if it was at an angle or straight down or what  marisha that could be so many things  laura yeah 
none	  marisha its hard to say  taliesin at this point can i tell anything about the muck from just boiling it to separate  components trying to just see whats in there im assuming its probably just deathpaste  its just rot  matt it looks to be just congealed decayed matter it does not have any properties that you  can tell on a chemical level at least that stand out  taliesin but it is decayed matter  matt it is various types of decayed matter organic matter  taliesin the tree is producing it  laura 
none	 so it is like oil  taliesin well heres my question  marisha its producing a lot of it too way more than it should  taliesin what do trees need to live  travis grass  sam sunlight and water  laura sunlight and water  marisha and a little bit of minerals and dirt  taliesin where is the sunlight  laura not here  taliesin and the trees alive  marisha well were also in the feywild  laura might not need the same thing  marisha might not need the same thing  taliesin well its 
none	 got to eat something this is what its producing  and its got to eat something  laura maybe it eats living creatures  taliesin maybe it eats trees  liam so percival would you imagine that the science of the feywild i dont know what that  phrase means would it be the same as our own world maybe it follows different rules  taliesin it probably does but at the same time you dont get something from nothing and  life needs things to live  sam thats so poetic  taliesin you dont get life from nothing 
none	 a little iffy  laura and we did see those branches moving like actual limbs on a being  as opposed to branches on a tree  marisha well i mean nothing here has really been natural  laura it could be like a venus flytrap  taliesin its just a hypothesis but what if the trees carnivorous or omnivorous  laura i think thats a very viable option  marisha so you think maybe its the tree that ate that other group of trees  laura possibly  taliesin its very big  marisha its a cannibal tree  
none	 taliesin it might be a cannibal tree  marisha its eating its own kind  travis i mean the sphinx did say that the bow is the heart of a cancerous tree i think if were  expecting to not find the tree were stupid  marisha does fenthras mean anything fenthras doesnt mean anything right  travis i am the wrong one to ask  laura fenthras is that elven  matt fenthras is elven  marisha is that a name  matt there is no direct translation to it per se but its name has hints or at 
none	 least bases  of the ancient elven words for protector and growth  taliesin interesting  marisha protector and growth  travis why dont we poison the tree  laura i think its already poisoned  taliesin how do you poison a poisoned tree  laura give it sunlight  taliesin sunlight is definitely something you should put in your arsenal  whatever its not used to being exposed to  laura sunlight and water fresh water  taliesin i dont think rot is going to be how we kill this thing  i think its not going to be 
none	 like the crocodile  travis abba music  laura laughs abba music  marisha no it seems  taliesin it needs purification  sam dont worry pike can oh  travis i also have poison  sam oh okay  taliesin i think it might just laugh poison off  travis oh  taliesin i dont know  travis what about honey  taliesin nothing laughs honey off  laura you have honey can you make honey in your  taliesin can you make honey in that jar  liam pull out the magic jug yeah  laura you can 
none	 make fresh water in that jug though cant you  travis i got honey for you  taliesin youve got very little brain dont you  marisha make some maple syrup  sam how about holy water  travis no  laura maybe i dont know  travis i mean i can make some water if you wanna bless it  sam no  taliesin thats not what were hoping for  marisha i mean when i was in my earth elemental form i got up underneath the tree i mean  i feel like if we needed to i 
none	 can get inside of it  travis laughs by yourself  laura i think that could be a very scary prospect  travis let me tell you a tale of two people that went inside a dragon  liam worked out  marisha yeah theyre still sitting here today its fine  taliesin i was about to say i dont think its much of a cautionary tale really  marisha no if anything its a terrible terrible influence  taliesin yes i think thats definitely i think light i think electricity  marisha well its not short on water thats 
none	 for sure  taliesin there is water in the was there groundwater of some kind  marisha i mean it was sludgy enough was there groundwater  matt i mean there were pockets or some bit of groundwater in there but a lot of the dense  pockets you found were just deeply seated pockets of that sludgelike material that seems to be  produced or put out by the nearby roots  marisha right  laura when you talked to the trees around you did it seem like they were actually alive  or was it all dead forest 
none	 that weve been traveling through  marisha when i communed with nature  laura yeah  marisha everything was alive everywhere thats what the rules here havent really  sam have you been talking to any of the trees around here right around here  marisha yeah i can i can  laura maybe before we sleep can you talk to the nature  marisha i can  taliesin ill watch this  marisha do we have any questions that i might want to figure out before i  sam is the big tree eating you all  laura are 
none	 you friends with the big tree how can we help  taliesin can we cure you  marisha cure the tree is the tree eating other things can we cure the tree  sam is that a tree  marisha is that even a tree  laura oh what if its a big scary creature not actually a tree  travis can we hurt the tree  liam does the tree have a weakness  laura yeah  marisha ill maybe try and figure out okay all right im gonna go step outside  laura do you want to hang 
none	 out on the broom so you dont actually step  travis youre just giving the broom away now  laura well i just dont want anybody to actually stand on a tree for very long  travis just saying  marisha i have to be connected with the ground i think  taliesin tie a rope around her this time  laura right  marisha okay yeah tie a rope around me and i jump back in the mud  matt you land splash close to kneedeep in the actual muck below you  marisha im gonna kind of lay 
none	 back into it  laura oh jeez  sam ooh like american beauty  marisha sensory deprivation tankstyle  laura i just send things down onto her  sam chicken  matt as you lay there you slowly sink into it until you guys just see the outside of keyleths  face emerge some of her horned crown sticking out of the muck a little bit of her chest and her  knees and some of the hands emerging the rest of her is submerged entirely in this muck  travis sweet  matt you close your eyes and begin 
dung	 reciting the incantation of the spell you begin to worry as  she begins to sink further in but as she finishes the incantation she stops sinking and it brings  her to the surface halfway and keeps her at this balance point there  laura were just staring out the door down at her  taliesin holding a rope  matt suddenly your consciousness kind of extends into all the nearby and its rush because theres  just life all around you life itself is dark its twisted but it is living what do you wish  to ask 
none	 of the nearby essence  marisha um okay can i figure out what is feeding the tree what the tree if the tree is  consuming things around it what is fueling the tree  matt the response  marisha i sense a lot coming out from the tree thats clear  can i sense an energy going in towards the tree  matt well your question is what is feeding the tree you have to ask a question  marisha what is fueling the tree yes  matt sondur  sam sondur  laura we arent listening to this 
none	  marisha sondur  travis i love having a character who cant read no pressure  matt sondur is the only response you get  marisha what is the trees weakness  sam poovah  all laugh  sam shamalaka  taliesin terry  laura laughs terry  matt you get no response it seems like the question doesnt take hold in the connection  there is no answer to that question it doesnt consume  the question asked as part of the incantation  laura remember we asked if it was an actual tree if its an actual tree 
none	  sam has it been eating you  laura whispers who is sondur  marisha who is sondur thats actually i shouldve thought about that  thats a good one  matt it has to relate to the area terrain bodies of water actual information about  individuals the living essence of the forest would not probably know that  marisha okay then can i ask the living fauna around me if this tree is sucking life force from  them is the tree in the middle hurting the plants all around like for example  matt the answer is 
none	 yes  marisha is that all i got  matt thats your two questions you asked one that wasnt effectual  and thus the incantation did not consider it utilized  sam is it a tree  matt one more question  marisha is the cancerous tree more than just a tree  sam good question  matt yes  sam yes  marisha sure that probably sure  taliesin we got a name  matt and with that suddenly you feel the incantation break its hold with the nearby life  sources you begin to sink once again  
none	 laura gasps pull her out pull her out  matt as you guys pull up as you reach up and grab it pulling her free from the swampy morass  and carry her back up to the entrance of the mansion  sam what did he say  marisha sondur  sam sondur  laura what do you mean sondur  marisha sondur thats  laura is that a band what is it  sam flight of the sondurs  marisha laughs flight of the sondurs  travis is that like an elven word  laura is it an elven 
none	 word  marisha is it an elven word  laura that weve heard  sam do any of us recognize the word  matt none of you recognize the word but it does sound like a name with elvish background or  heritage or at least some sort of ancient elvish roots to the name structure it doesnt have  specific meaning but there are names youve heard of people of  elven lineage that are plays on a similar sound  laura does it sound i mean what would those names mean  matt well i mean the one 
none	 thats closest to you is your fathers which is syldor  laura right and hes a dick so the tree probably is too  sam sondur syldor theyre brothers  matt totally  sam isnt that how it works  laura that is how it works vex and vax  marisha percy  taliesin yes  marisha youve done a lot of reading of the elven culture do you know anything about a sondur  matt you have no idea  taliesin i have no idea im racking my brain and wishing i had access to a library  laura 
none	 do you have a library here  sam do i  matt well you can have one apparate within the mansion if you wish  sam with books  matt yeah  sam of course i have a library its in my personal chambers where i do all of my studying  travis keyleth  laura oh we have to go to your actual bedroom  taliesin its all pornography just the entire library is like  sam only in the back  taliesin its like beauty and the beast its just pornography  marisha yes grog  travis did 
none	 you ask if the tree was just one thing  marisha it didnt appear to be one thing  because it was harming the plant life around it so its not necessarily all connected  it seems but it is also definitely not just a tree  travis what if we like salt the earth thats an expression  taliesin its more than an expression its legitimately something you do unfortunately  you need salt for that  laura do we have salt do we have lots of salt here in the mansion scanlan  sam its all over the 
none	 floor of the kitchen  laura oh but we cant bring it out we cant bring it out  travis i have 12 gallons of salt water  marisha didnt you get a bunch of salt when you jumped into the  laura i dont know if 12 gallons is enough to kill a tree  marisha when you did the cannonball contest  taliesin that wasnt salt  travis ive heard them say it before theyre like oh you are the salt of the earth  taliesin that wasnt salt that was something else and i used it all 
none	 for the cannonball  sam so whats our plan do we attack this thing with brute force how do we corrupt the ground  you can turn the ground to stone will that help anything right  travis whats on the other side of this tree its huge its a hundred feet  taliesin inside the tree is the bow i think if we remove the bow i think if we find the bow  inside the tree i think thats how  sam thats a lot of tree to search it could be way up it could be in 
none	 a branch  liam what is the legend at the heart of this tree  taliesin the heart of this tree i think we go in  travis it used to be a titan that had its heart broken or something  liam probably inside  laura yeah what if the  sam it says it now acts as the heart to a cancerous tree corrupting the verdant land  taliesin if i were the heart of a tree id be in the center  marisha it was a bow that felled the titans  laura i feel like we 
none	 probably shouldve done some research on fenthras before we came out here  sam we can go to my library  laura look in your library i am following you to your library  taliesin im curious to see the library i just want to see  what a giant disaster this is  matt you did receive a little information about it from allura from her research as well  laura yes thats right thats right  matt did you write that down  sam maybe  laura yeah but i listened to her real hard when she was 
none	 talking  sam marisha writes down everything  marisha i do its just where  sam the bigger question is how does she find it  marisha how do i find it exactly when did we talk to her  matt last time you were in whitestone right before you left for the actual feywild  laura aw man i dont think i wrote it down i think i was just listening  marisha all right feywild hang on  sam i know that simons mom is elwen  matt there you go see perfect that was prestream  sam 
none	 i know that  laura fenthras no thats all i wrote  matt laughs you were so excited for a second so excited  laura i was so excited cause i saw it written down but no i didnt write  matt no  laura im sorry  travis youre gonna make me check my notes  laura i didnt write it down dammit balls but i have a real good  sam i know that theres a hatmaker named deirdre somewhere in the world  matt guys you guys  liam would a really successful history check help vex 
none	 remember what the fuck she was told  matt laughs go ahead and make a history check  laura okay okay okay  travis ive got vegemite written down  taliesin i think thats a shopping list  marisha god i was clearly writing incredibly fast  laura shit history  taliesin yeah  sam did you roll it  laura 17 is what i rolled  sam well thats something  matt 17 is not too bad  marisha i have archfey black heart  matt yes  laura okay that jogged my memory a little bit i sort 
none	 of remember  matt there you go  marisha he was an arch yes go ahead  matt there was an archfey that existed here that was apparently the holder of fenthras that was  betrayed and his heart became corrupted and thus became the center of this corruption  sam there you go  marisha so we can assume that the archfey is probably sondur  laura sondur  marisha and hes probably still inside the tree and he probably is not gonna let go of his bow  laura what exactly is an archfey  matt an archfey 
none	 from your knowledge and experience theyre very powerful fey creatures  some largely belonged to some of the leading courts in the feywild  the seelie and the unseelie  liam oberon  laura oh  matt some unaffiliated like for instance in midsummer nights dream  titania and oberon would totally be archfey  laura archfey okay  matt very very powerful and influential fey creatures that both have understanding and powers  to bend the surrounding feywild to their will  marisha and then he must have fought in what was known as the calamity  travis yes 
none	  matt well the calamity wasnt against the titans the calamity those were the final battles  of the gods physically on exandria before the divergence in which they  separated from all their creations for good  marisha where does black heart come from  marisha why did i write that down  matt his heart was corrupted i dont know why you wrote it down  marisha i wrote down black heart  taliesin seemed like a thing  marisha seemed important  matt sure  laura okay  marisha cause he was corrupted okay  sam so 
none	 were fighting an archfey inside a tree  laura so we know how to fight the tree okay  sam we gotta get the archfey out of the tree  taliesin we gotta get the archfey out of the tree  marisha so someones going into the tree  laura maybe we can talk to it  sam whats its name again sorry  matt sondur  sam sondur  matt was the name you were given  laura maybe if we call out to him hell talk to us  marisha maybe  liam maybe if we put shorthalt 
none	 forward  laura youre so charming  taliesin you are so charming  sam yeah sure  taliesin and you have so much good advice  travis do fey creatures live a long time  sam hey sondur sondur give us your bow  travis what if he was betrayed by something in the feywild and we found that thing  whether it was a comrade or a  liam well that seems likely but wed have to turn over every stone in lala land to find it  laura or we have to talk to him and find out 
none	 and maybe  travis yeah and you can talk to trees  marisha i can i can attempt to talk to the tree  taliesin after a rest im going to sleep  liam scanlan and keyleth combo  marisha huh  liam scanlan and keyleth duo to talk to the tree  sam what are we asking the tree  laura in the morning  sam yeah but what are we  travis who betrayed it  laura were gonna talk to sondur and see you know why are you acting this way  liam yes how can we 
none	 help you how can we fix whats going on  laura oh no look at his face he looks like that is a very bad idea  marisha laughs why are you acting this way  matt no im just im just enjoying you guys planning and plotting  sam were just gonna say hey sondur how can we help you  laura yeah yeah yeah like how can we help you why are you hurting  marisha please give us your bow yeah  laura no no dont even bring up the bow right now lets just try to 
none	 help him out  marisha so wait are we here on a mission to cleanse the land is that what were posing as  were like missionaries  laura i mean if we did cleanse the land that would be a wonderful thing  taliesin that would be great  marisha it would be a wonderful thing  taliesin but were also getting the bow  laura the bow is a wonderful thing i have a pretty fucking cool bow now i dont even know if  this new ones gonna be as cool you dont even know what mythcarver 
none	 does titanstone knuckles  arent advancing at all who knows maybe this bow is shit and  the whole point of this is so we can help people  taliesin i think itll give you wings so you can fly  travis cant we just say that were obsessed with the hundredfoot fucking  moving tree in the middle of the feywild  laura maybe we just think its really cool  travis yeah weve come to talk to it no bullshit  sam were fanboys  laura yeah  travis no  laura yeah like weve heard tale and 
none	 its wonderful  travis we wanna know whats up  sam great that sounds like its gonna end well  travis well if he pulls any shit then we kill it  sam okay  taliesin i am going to sleep theres nothing that can be solved right now that cannot be solved  over coffee and bacon  laura we dont have bacon  marisha just chicken and waffles  taliesin i will make bacon from chicken  sam chickenskin bacon  laura ooh that actually sounds really good  taliesin that actually sounds really good  liam tofurkey

none	 you all right  laura um yes i dont know its the weirdest thing i never realized how much it affected me  until we actually were faced with it again it was good standing in front of him with  everyone else wasnt it  liam ive hes not a concern for me anymore i dont think fondly back on it we have bigger  things on our plates but i do care how he affects you and there is no question how much it affected  you when percival made his offer in that room and i was 
none	 a little surprised and im not trying  to start an argument or anything like that i know why he did it of course and every fairy  within a thousand miles of that room could see how deeply it affected you and it surprised me  because look if that makes you happy it is to be embraced and im certainly in  support of anything that gives our father heartburn but  im sorry his offer in your brothers eyes is a bit like gilding a lily or framing a  sunset you have always been the coolest 
none	 person i have known ever in my life and you still are  youre already perfect at least in your brothers eyes and i guess i just hope you  believe in you as much as i do because its quite a bit  laura thank you i mean i cant give back the title that would be kind of shit  liam well youre a countessa know i understand thats what you are  laura baroness no baroness actually  liam all right  laura just a little bit cooler than before just a little  liam whatever floats 
none	 your boat stubby but you know just dont wuss out on me now  laura i wont  liam all right youve always been stronger than me i need you to keep doing that  laura its all an act dear  liam bullshit thats it  laura i love you thank you  liam i love you too  laura go get some sleep your feathers are all ruffled  liam all right  matt all right so as you separate and go find your own ways to rest you guys find your way to  your dreams for

none	 say anything and  taliesin no  laura really what you did back in syngorn was more than i ever expected and honestly its  i dont know of any other time that somebody has stuck up for me quite as much outside of vax  so thank you  taliesin youre welcome and its the lovely thing about a title and i had one to give  is that its when used appropriately and properly its mostly there to remind you you  dont really need it  laura right question though  taliesin yes  laura because i 
none	 sort of realized being a baroness of whitestone that i literally owe my  fealty and allegiance to you  taliesin yes  laura all right  taliesin well technically my sister but yes  laura okay  taliesin if that makes you feel a little better  laura thank you grand sire de rolo and if theres anything you ever need in return  all you have to do is ask  taliesin never do that again that was very weird it was really it was it was worth it to  see the look on his face  
none	 laura it was quite wonderful  taliesin it was quite wonderful no and it worked out well because technically speaking  theres only really about 15 foot square thats actually standing  that you technically have a baronry over  laura oh  taliesin and at the moment it is currently a shrine to the raven queen  so that works out well  laura oh thats what so technically we gave it to zahra didnt we  taliesin no shes just fixing it up for us  laura okay all right  taliesin we did not give it to 
dung	 her it wasnt mine to give just the title youre welcome  and it doesnt change anything  laura good that would be very strange wouldnt it  taliesin yeah although i imagine youre eventually going to  become very insufferable but yes  laura only sometimes dear  taliesin oh you have to be theres a thing but well get to that later there is a thing  i forgot there is a thing  laura does it have to do with the hunt  taliesin yes a thing well get to that its really not important right now 
none	 thats if we  survive that would be very important but right now its not  laura not not a given  taliesin no  laura we might die today  taliesin we might  laura im gonna get some coffee  taliesin i think thats an excellent idea let me join you  matt you all eventually find your way down breakfast served in a central dining table with  no platters no silverware  laura thanks grog  travis its a mansion we could eat somewhere else  matt the meals are just placed literally on the table

none	 theyre swamp shoes theyre circular theyre like large circles and theres like a  base connected to them and whole things connected together with ropes  marisha kind of like snowshoes but with more surface area  travis im only wearing that if it helps  taliesin it does it will keep you from sinking into the muck it will allow you to youll have  to walk very slowly you cant walk very quickly and if things get hairy you can cut them off  theyre just wood and rope theyre not that complicated  marisha basically wood paddles 
none	 on our feet  taliesin yes move like a giant frog  marisha yeah  travis i put the giant frogshoes on  matt all right you put them on you guys exit the mansion  liam i set the deathwalkers ward for necrotic damage  matt okay necrotic damage is set okay as you guys emerge  laura oh wait  taliesin you dont need them though youre the one person who doesnt need them  laura how long does protection against poison last oh its only an hour okay so no  i dont want to cast it

none	 of you it does help you are not sinking your progress is very slow  slower than it was previously when you were already at halfspeed but you arent breaking the  surface of the actual substance it is sticky and you have to pull it forth and it is tension  put on the ropes but for the most part most of you are light of foot and its not a  huge issue except for you trinkets just up to his elbows just sloshing through the water  laura does he look miserable  matt hes not enjoying 
none	 himself  laura do you wanna go in the crystal okay  matt and he just keeps pushing forward  liam all right im scritching his ears while we walk  laura thank you  matt you push onward its not too far of a distance it takes you ten or fifteen minutes to  reach the very base of the tree where you had previously scoped out the large roots climb up  ten 12 feet before emerging from the base of this large tree maybe at this point you can look at  it now taller than you 
none	 thought at a distance its roughly 80 to 100 feet in width and probably  over 150 to 200 feet tall it is just a thick solid giant tree  laura that is a hugeass tree  sam as we approach i take a little muck and im going to draw like a little tree on my forehead  and one on keyleths forehead as well  marisha what are you drawing  sam just like a little mud tree on your forehead  marisha oh yeah  liam not a penis at all  laura oh yeah  marisha

none	 while others begin to slowly pull apart  that giant mass of vines that are clustered between two of the large roots that merge with the  tree begin to untangle and fall free revealing what appears to be a slowly opening pathway into  the tree itself you now see what looks to be about four and a half feet tall and about three  feet wide a tunnel like a crack in the bark itself  that disappears into darkness deeper into  the tree  laura no  marisha me and my fellow companions are coming in

none	 inside this space  marisha i look at scanlan and wipe the treedick off my forehead  matt okay its pitchblack in here by the way  sam whispering its our sign  matt percy you see nothing the rest of you have some semblance of darkvision here so you can  see the interior here it is walltowall vines and thick heavy roots you are definitely on the  inside of the tree this portion of the giant hollow chamber you can see it kind of lifts up  entangled webs of these branches and smaller longdead trees jutting 
dung	 out inside  like actual smaller physical trees within the large tree as you all enter the little bit of  light behind you grog begins to shrink and you look over your shoulder as the entrance  you came through slams closed and you are all left in darkness  laura were just stuck in a tree now  travis well he puckered up  matt the smell gets stronger and stronger at that point as grog you kind of pull your way  through and youre all standing shouldertoshoulder in this dark space  this one singular tree 
none	 root thats sticking up from the center in two different places  this thin reedy voice begins to echo through sourceless around you that says  i know you the moment you touched my  sickness i knew you  at this moment small patches of fungal clusters  begin to illuminate in the room areas of the vines and ground just spring to life and this  dull blue glow begins to fill the room with very very low light you can just make out shapes  you can see that the vines are just very slowly shifting around 
none	 you the walls are not still  that little bit of movement youd occasionally catch on the outside of the tree it is perpetual  inside here it is this constant churning mass of living tree you look up and you can see all the  branches come and mat together into this conical ceiling where a number of vines drip down and  just hang hundreds of them you see the vines are slowly coalescing in the center of this upward  kind of pinnacle slithering one into the next like a thousand slithering snakes  a voice comes 
none	 out again  why do you come here children of the lost  what purpose brings you to sondurs madness and pain  laura weve come to help you  matt a mass in the ceiling separates ever so slightly and you watch as two feet descend from  this strange apex you now see the feet are a full creature held aloft by connected tendrils of  black plant matter emanating from the back and shoulders as it slowly descends from the ceiling  a thin elflike individual their body comprised of hundreds of small plants leaves and thorns 
none	  the only semblance of flesh you see across the face is the nose the eyes and the mouth  the rest of it just slowly giving way to a similar nest of plantlike vines that completely  fill the exterior of this room it slowly touches down its feet hitting the ground and as it does  the tendrils all detach and withdraw back into the ceiling leaving it there arms to its side  its head down its face comes up its eyes immediately open with this bright yellow glow that  kind of bathes you you can 
none	 see the form the edges of all of your allies now even being  framed by this light thats just pouring forth from its face  laura i bow  liam follow suit  sam sure ill bow as well  matt you all bow before this creature do you bow all right  marisha i stand as well  matt all right  you all come here but one of you is the reason  it looks straight towards you the light focuses  and narrows from his eyes  you sweet broken vexahlia unwanted daughter unproven ally selfish 
none	 and cruel you drive those  whom you would call family into danger and death for your own gain i understand you  theres a softness and sadness to the face as  he takes one step in your direction  you are lost without form without knowing who you are child  you stand shattered by expectation  presenting an illusion of confidence behind it you never left that bloodied girl  dagger in hand body at your feet you are a killer run as you may the tears you cry are not  in vain my sweet my 
none	 dear vexahlia you can rise above your trembling destiny i have lived a  thousand years and a day i have seen many things i can grant many gifts  laura are we still pretending to like this fuck  sam nope  laura i dont want anything you offer  matt you mistake my intent is not to hurt but to understand i see lots of my youth in you  we are not as different as you may think you have things i do not companionship  i have been without for so very long and the ones 
none	 i have let in have hurt me so very deeply  his eyes actually cast away from you for a second and he steps back into place almost seems  to his confident form withdraws into this almost hanging sad position  laura youve been betrayed  matt we all have in some degree yes  laura is that why you are what you are now  matt i dont even remember i just know that im alone and she left me there  laura she who is she  matt memories have faded i just want someone to understand

none	 lonely guy  laura 16  taliesin i have no respect for anyone who says were not so different  matt 16 points of piercing damage  liam and shitting black diarrhea out of the tree  matt as the arrow hits his form as hes being pulled up gasps you hear the air escape like  he had the wind knocked out of him his glowing yellow eyes blink blink and his jaw kind of  hangs open there in the lowlit darkness and you watch as more of that black thick tar  just begins to pour from 
dung	 his mouth onto the ground splattering and seeping into the floor  his jaw slowly closes  then i am to be alone  he reaches his hand up and you watch  marisha oh shit  matt  as these vines reveal and give to him this large curved bow that he grasps in his hand  the other vines curl around his body and you can see his form begin to build like his actual body  begins to grow as the vines become part of him his face of flesh disappears behind an exterior  of dark 
none	 and gnarled wood the voice grows deep as he all of a sudden withdraws into the side of the  tree itself and then bursts forth landing on the ground not an elflike entity but some sort of  gnarled rootlike tree creature holding fenthras in one hand  laura was that bad should i have not attacked him  sam you did great  laura okay  taliesin no no he was being terrible  laura we should probably  matt your choice is made  laura i call out trinket  matt become another memory here and keep

none	 a tree it instantly dies  laura thats just the rule thats just what it says  matt you notice as you tear into its body with the tree stride to open it up it looks down  confused as you pull into it and then just begin pummeling and scraping the inside of its form  as you do so from the inside what little bit of fire retardantlike black liquid was somewhat  dried or coated on these not as thick as it was on sondur not only has it caught fire but the  wood here is 
none	 very very ready for kindling and its vulnerable to fire everything in that  was doubled so you just tear into it  all yell  matt you just watch as this treant has a flaming elemental in its stomach just bursting forth in  gouts of fire you watch as it begins to crack up the center and parts of it are just bursting into  flames and burning at the top  laura holy crap  matt its having a bad day right now  laura keyleth serious  matt is that the end of your turn

none	 energy causing the one arm that was getting ready to pull one of  its thorny arrows kind of goes limp for a second and a second arrow just shoots right in the side  of the face and is now protruding from underneath his cheekbone angry breathing  laura and for my movement can i get on my broom for my movement  matt youd have to  laura id have to pull it out  matt your broom is kind of slung over your shoulder  laura right okay then im just gonna i feel like anywhere i

none	 there while the rest of you are  thrown including the treants at a similar velocity as you would plummet off a cliff  but upward up into the ceiling and roof slamming into the roots crack and then gravity  returns to normal and all of you fall once again slamming back down onto the ground  marisha am i immune to that as a fire elemental  matt you still take bludgeoning damage as an elemental  marisha just resistant to it  sam how highs the roof above the ground  matt its about 50 feet at 
none	 the top  laura so 100 no thats just two times in a row  sam two 50 drops  laura wow  matt thats a total of 24 points of bludgeoning damage to all of you except for vax  marisha i take half damage  matt you take half that because  marisha how much did you say it was 24  sam 24  matt not you grog youre unaffected by it yeah but the treants also take it  sam oh poor guys  matt all righty  sam no problem no problem  matt end

none	  matt make sure i got it right  liam it was roughly it was 20something 25  matt yeah were good were good all right third strike  liam third strike got eight  matt eight got it  liam thanks  matt as its on the ground sprawled out flames still burning off of it you leap up onto  its thigh and come down to some of the open wound that keyleths fire elementals been tearing  through youre just prying into it with your daggers and pulling the bark back revealing its  softer burning underwood 
none	 if you will you do a sincerely awful amount of damage to it and it  looks like the creatures already in dire straits  sam this is one of the treants  matt one of the treants yes  sam oh okay  matt does that end your turn  liam i just quickly look into keyleths flaming eyes and say finish it off and then im going  to run double speed along the curve of the wall underneath flying fuck  matt this way  liam yeah  marisha other way i think  matt oh this 
none	 way the one thats not flaming  liam past keyleth and the one that i just stabbed the shit out of  laura oh the other way you were going the right way  matt this way  liam yeah  matt okay youre about there with your movement  liam ive got double speed  matt all right oh yeah double speed youd actually get closer to there if you wanted  all right that ends your turn percy youre up actually at the end of percys turn hes gonna  use his last legendary action to go ahead 
none	 and make an attack with fenthras as he sees you running  past vax he goes ahead and takes one arrow shot at you  as youre running super fast across the floor  liam disadvantage  matt no because well no  liam turns on  matt  no you did at the beginning of your turn it did youre right so good thing too  19 and a one it goes to fire but youre too quick and as it releases its spikelike arrow  you hear it go right past you catching the edge of the cloak 
none	 and actually going through it  leaving a small hole in the corner but no impact to you all right so now percy its your turn  taliesin were both prone does that mean that were in combat  or can i walk away from it and it doesnt  matt youre both prone you can walk away without it getting an attack of opportunity you just  spend half your movement to get up  taliesin all right im spending half my movement to get up and im backing up against the wall  matt okay  taliesin backing 
none	 up against the wall im not using bad news im going to use retort  im going to try and first thing im gonna do is use a bonus action to heal a little bit yeah  thats nine plus twelve so thats 21 figure that out when its not my turn next thing im  gonna do is im gonna start shooting to try and get that bow out of his hands one more time  matt okay  taliesin first shot  matt this is with retort right  taliesin retort yeah same trick but not nearly as 
dung	 much damage thats 16 to hit  matt hits the nearby wood splinters off one of the vines sending a shower of broken wood chips  taliesin firing again  liam cmon dangerous nerd do it  laura laughs dangerous nerd  taliesin thats another 16  matt cant quite catch a bead on it being a human without dark vision its hard to see it in  the low glowing light  marisha i give off a soft glow  matt but at a distance  taliesin 18 to hit  matt that misses  all groan  taliesin 
none	 god damn it okay thats my bloody roll  marisha thats always a bummer man that sucks  matt ending percys turn that brings us to our next set of lair actions all right  taliesin god damn it  matt suddenly all the vines on the nearby walls on the inside of the tree whip out and begin  grabbing anyone nearby percy scanlan keyleth and vax you guys are all of a sudden the vines  try and wrap around you they pull you back  marisha immune to grapple  matt so yeah  liam dexterity save 
none	  matt the vines try and wrap around you keyleth and burn in the process you are still pulled  right against the wall i need vax scanlan and percy to make a strength saving throw  sam strength  liam strength  matt yes  sam oh god just straight strength  taliesin 23  sam 15  liam burn a luck ah 20  matt 20 okay vax and percy you guys manage to break free of the vines scanlan you are  considered grappled so your speed is zero the vines are actually holding you against the 
none	  side theyre not hurting you or anything but you cannot actually move from your space  cause youre being held against the wall of the tree  that ends the legendary action grog youre up  travis can i run immediately underneath sondur  matt sondur yes you can  travis are there any vines that are hanging from him there are none  matt there are vines hanging from the ceiling but he himself just kind of sunk into the tree  and then emerged above he himself does not have any wayward vines that are just hanging 
none	  travis right are there any vines that look like they might be thick enough for me to try and climb  up if i wanted to get to his height  matt probably a couple yeah  travis could i grab a few of those vines to try and climb up to where hes at  matt make an athletics check with disadvantage and then you have advantage because youre  raging so just a straight roll on that  travis athletics 23  matt 23 all right let me check and see how far you can actually climb 
none	 at that speed  sam tense fight guys wouldnt wanna be in it with anyone else  liam us against the environment  sam i think that my plan should work  matt id say your physical strength and your ability to just kind of one hand over hand  not even pull up especially with your titan gauntlets and that type of a roll you could  probably get right up to him but thats gonna be your action to get up there  travis okay  matt so youll only have your bonus action left at that time 
none	 but essentially you climb up and get  right up to where he is at the top of the tree as hes up there pulling the bow back getting  ready to you see another pointed arrow kind of shift out of his arm you come right up to his  face and youre right there holding on with the vines  with the axe hanging over your shoulder with the chain  travis with my bonus action can i let out the loudest howl i possibly can  matt yes you can  travis howls  matt all righty 
none	  marisha calling in the cavalry  laura yeah come on please i hope he can get in here  matt thats your turn  travis thats my turn  matt all right it is now sondurs turn  sam oh boy  matt all righty  laura hes deaf from that howl hes definitely deaf  matt no not so much sondur takes fenthras and actually lets go of it to his side and these  vines grab it and hold it in place just wherever he lets it go as he pulls back his fingers curl  up 
none	 into these giant extremely hard petrified rootlike clusters and he just starts starts  whaling on you as youre holding onto that vine three strikes against you  the first one is gonna be a 25  travis hits  matt second one is a 23  travis also hits  matt third one is a 15  travis misses  matt it hits you but just not enough to do any damage so looking at this that brings it to  oh no thats two 14 points of bludgeoning damage on the first one halved  and the second 
none	 one  laura oh its just the fucking coolest  matt 22 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to 11 i need you to go ahead and make a strength  saving throw to maintain your hold on that vine  as he just bats you around  travis thats a 21  matt 21 it punches you twice and your grip causes you to slide a foot but you catch yourself  and youre still maintaining yourself the vine is now swinging from the impact and youre in the  process of this weird momentum where youre passing by a 
none	 little out of control with your  movement up in the air of the inside of this tree  travis awesome  matt so thats gonna end its action you now watch as sondur reaches up and grabs the bow again  and shifts into the tree to get away from you you do get an attack of opportunity though  as you come around watching him sink in with your one hand on the axe  travis oh that was so close to being a crit that is a 33  matt laughs  laura 19 isnt a crit 
none	 for him right  travis no  matt no so go ahead i will say the damage is gonna be a 1d10 rather than a 1d12 just for the  sake of youre swinging with one hand  travis thats wait no thats 22 plus one point of necrotic damage so 23  matt all right so 23 points of slashing damage as you come around as the vine is arcing around  whack you cleave through catch part of the side of the shoulder and the jaw part of this hard  bony root exterior actually gets carved off 
none	 and you see more black ooze spill out from underneath  as it shrieks pulling back into the tree you watch him vanish youre still left there  travis killed him  laura good job grog  liam smacked him into the wall  travis not so tough really  liam go hide like a potato in the earth oh jeez  matt as high up as sondur can get right at the edge actually emerging out of the ceiling portion  of the top of it ten feet higher than he was before he comes out with fenthras  
none	 laura ten feet higher than he was before  matt before he was out of the wall before the ceiling even came up into a cone hes now coming  out of the ceiling in another part  laura jeez  matt now hanging out halfway and ready to go ahead and let loose with a bow thats gonna end  his turn however  liam how high off the ground is that apex that hes hanging out of  matt right now hes 40 feet up  liam 40 feet all right  matt yep that ends his turn 
none	 it is now the treants go they both get up using half their  movement laughs lets see that one currently is just being harried with the flames on the  inside it takes does it take any damage on its turn  marisha it does unless he douses himself he takes another 1d10  matt go ahead and do 1d10 damage to him  marisha six  taliesin doubled  laura doubled yeah  matt as it begins to take the damage it begins to pat out the flames but as it does the fire  just roars into 
none	 this inferno and you hear it give out this creaking painful pained groan as it  tumbles forward in a timber fashion the flames actually burning the life essence out of the  treant it falls to the ground dead smoldering  sam hey damn  travis yes  matt you pop out of his form as the living entity is no longer living and you are but an elemental  now im gonna leave him there just for reference because it is a big thing to get through  but you are now pushed off to the side that 
none	 treant is gone the other one gets up and  steps over to percy  taliesin i made a friend  matt you did as you just manage to avoid that the treant comes up  and goes into a doubleslam against you  laura fuck  matt that is gonna be 19  taliesin that hits  matt and 21  taliesin that also hits  matt all righty you take  taliesin im fine  matt 13 points of bludgeoning damage 20 points of bludgeoning damage on the second hit  laura gasps  taliesin thats mean  
none	 matt its now pushing you up against the side of the tree you can feel the roots hitting the back  of your head and as you ricochet off the impact you come into another fist right to the face  you feel the nose break under the impact and possibly a tooth get loose as you spit blood out  the side it was a rough hit on you  taliesin yeah that was rough  matt all right that ends the treants turn scanlan and keyleth youre up  marisha youre still  matt youre grappled and currently 
none	 prone  sam okay  marisha where is he where are you scanlan  sam im against the close side of the wall  matt youre over there  but because your movement is zero and youre grappled you cannot get up so right now you are  prone and stuck to a wall  sam can i pull out a wand or not even  matt you can pull out a wand youre just at disadvantage for all attacks right now  sam all attacks even spell attacks  matt you have disadvantage on attack rolls and any attack 
none	 rolls against you have advantage  yeah if theyre within five feet of you otherwise they have disadvantage  marisha i might be able to try and do something if i can go first  sam thats attack rolls fireballs just happen  matt correct  marisha maybe i can burn you away  sam ill do fireball on the treant ill aim it far away enough so that it wont hit us  is that a thing is that possible  matt it is its hard because youre on the ground and hes right there  sam can i 
none	 go up  laura can you hit sondur  sam well yeah but i dont know how  matt its your call its a tough circumstance here because to hit the treant from your  perspective youd have to hit behind it but you have no view behind it  because youre on the ground  sam got it got it all right  matt i mean if you want to try that ill give you a roll and based on how good you roll it may  or may not hit an ally  sam then i will not 
none	 risk it and i will just fireball good old sondur i guess  matt all righty how many more  sam ill use three more charges i have seven total  matt okay seven total left or total  sam total so ive used three  matt well no you used five last time  sam i thought the first one is just three balls no i dont know how this shit works  matt what does it say on the actual item  sam i dont have it anymore i lost it months and months ago  all laugh 
dung	  matt its a good thing its in the dungeon masters guide god damn it sam let me know  these things i can get you the item printout  liam king of improv right here  matt okay wand of fireballs has seven charges you can use an action to expend one or more  charges to cast the fireball spell for one charge its the level three and for each  additional charge its more than that so  sam so i used three charges  matt so you used three charges you have four charges left yes 
none	  sam okay so im gonna use three on him  matt oh three more all right go for it thatll be another 10d6  taliesin i dont understand how magic works  laura i dont know i dont understand that at all  matt well see if he makes his saving throw it does not make the saving throw its gonna use  its legendary resistance to automatically make it  laura aw  marisha fucking dick  laura does that half it again  matt yeah  travis i have a question  matt whats your question grog 
none	  travis i forgot about retaliation thats a new feat i have  matt yeah where when it hits you you can use your reaction but you used your reaction to get  an attack of opportunity so you still hit him  travis oh thats true  matt but essentially they dont have to do that now as long as they hit you you can use your  reaction to just hit them back  travis hit them back  matt so yeah as long as you stay within melee  travis as long as im within five feet 
none	 that count on his two hits against me  matt i mean you can only do it once because you only get one reaction  travis one time okay  matt and you technically already hit him with that  travis thats true  matt same thing so you used your attack of opportunity  so you can do that whenever anybody hits you  laura see youre fine  matt youre good but good to remember  sam laura are you like  laura about to die yeah  travis i havent used it before  sam all right 
none	 that was 29 so 14  matt 29 halve that 14 points of fire damage  laura like one more hit and im unconscious  matt as another fireball bursts into the air lighting up the room even brighter for an  instant you can see now as the smoke clears the front of sondurs form is black and beginning  to char with each blast of flame a lot of the oil has dried off and is now coming off in clumps  laura thats good  matt almost like dried mud all right  sam i will also 
none	 heal vex shes close enough right yeah yeah ish  taliesin yeah  sam with an inspirational quote  laura laughing no  sam something percival once said a long long time ago  taliesin oh no oh no  laura im ready  sam life needs things to live thats it thats the whole quote  all laugh  sam earlier tonight percival von fredrickstein von rollo de frankenstein de roll  credit where credit is due  liam put it on a kitten poster  sam oh and ill do it at level three so thats  sorry

none	 basically killed him with broshame  liam and that cheeky line about romance  travis i know fuck i throw it and hopefully get it to go right in his mouth as hes trying to have  a comeback and ill just look bewildered that it worked  matt as you just shove it upward  liam can he use his bonus action to just shove his sunglasses up at the end  matt as you chuck the javelin you see it burst forth with lightningbased propulsion magic  it sinks into the center of the jaw which the eyes 
none	 go wide the jaw hangs open loosely  and you can see the secondary face of sondur inside the javelin pierced through his jaw now  his eyes wide and you see the hand reach up to try and grab the back of the vines as he does  the javelin bursts into a shockwave of electrical energy scattering his body into a hundred pieces  across the wall falling off vax you are pushed back from the force of it tumbling manage to  catch yourself in the air with your wings still flying as the rest of sondurs 
none	 body just  comes clattering to the ground in chunks  laura i jump up on grogs back what the fuck  travis i honestly did not expect that to happen  taliesin im gonna walk up and grab  laura oh my god  matt the javelin clatters to the ground  taliesin grab the bow real quick  travis i go get the javelin because its obviously worth keeping  sam i instinctually throw keyleth in the air  marisha and i go for it too  matt you manage to dig yourself out of your vines and 
none	 rush up to keyleth  sam no no with the hand  matt with the hand oh yeah the hand darts over grabs the fire elemental and just kinda  sound of throwing and catching  marisha heeheehee  travis can i run back to vex and offer her a healing potion unless someone can do better  laura oh i can cast cure wounds on myself  travis are you all right  laura im fine thank you i was really regretting that attacking him i thought maybe i  shouldve just said yes and dealt with it  
none	 travis what become a corpse bride  taliesin he was terrible  laura i dont know i just felt terrible  taliesin he was terrible  marisha i drop my fire elemental form  taliesin that was a terrible person  travis its all right  laura thanks grog  travis you did you did good  laura thanks so did you  matt a loud impact sounds as ukurat lands  sam oh thank god  laura im gonna cast cure wounds on myself before anything else happens as high of a level as i  can which is 
none	 level three  matt go for it  sam does my song of rest need to be during a short rest  matt yes  taliesin we have a mansion thats within walking distance and if we have to we will run  travis im gonna hand her the potion anyway as shes standing there so  matt okay as she finishes healing herself ukurat walks up towards the center of the room  where youre standing next to her and just kind of pushes the currently nowsmoldering body of the  treant to the side  a little late 
none	 on the call to arms im just sad i missed most of the fight  travis didnt want you to miss out on all the action  matt got a couple licks in well i guess this calls us even  laura yeah  sam thanks for coming  laura thank you for joining us  matt be safe  laura you too  travis wait what will you do now  matt my business is my own as is yours ill find my people well find a home for us  now youve done your task  leave before 
none	 you plummet into any further  unknown dangers foolish people  he turns around and leaps towards the opening that he carved and crawls out  of it and just disappears  marisha you know from him i think that was a compliment  taliesin it kind of was  marisha yeah  travis hes so awesome  taliesin it is sort of sad that we didnt catch any theater  laura well theres still time  travis can i try and jump through the hole like he did  matt you reach over and leap through the hole catch 
none	 it  yeah its still open its like pulled open and actually  travis i dont make it all the way in though do i its up there  matt oh no the hole that he pulled in was the entrance you walked in to the base  travis oh good  matt so you get there  travis little colonoscopy  matt little bit yeah  marisha i go up to vex and i just grab her arm and i say  dont let any man or anyone for that matter make you feel like you need them to 
none	 be  great because you dont im not good with words  laura that was wonderful keyleth thank you  marisha but he was an asshole  laura no yeah he was really right  marisha and i dont want you ever dating an asshole  laura laughs thank you  marisha he wasnt good enough he was mean  taliesin im going to saunter over  laura what  taliesin in an exaggeratedly evil voice were a lot alike you and i bleaaah normal voice what  an asshole jesus  marisha in an exaggeratedly evil voice you drug 
none	 your friends to their doom  travis can i walk over to vax while theyre making a show  marisha we keep making a show  travis quietly i say  what was he talking about with the bloody dagger  liam sorry feywild interference what was that  travis what was he saying about the bloody dagger when he was talking to vex  liam you know its interesting i understand exactly zero percent of what the dm was saying  while he was incharacter as that particular character  due to the nature of skype and microphones  
none	 travis yes  liam so i was faking understanding the whole time and then picked it up in retrospect  listening to lauras responses i missed it  travis yeah  laura whos this laura youre speaking of  all laugh  liam i dont know i dont know anything  laura thats okay its fine that you didnt hear he said nothing about a bloody dagger  nothing at all  liam we should find that dagger no question  taliesin is there anything other than the bow worth looting on this terrible person since im  rummaging through 
none	 his  matt make an investigation check  taliesin right  travis well lets not downplay the bow  taliesin ive got it already  sam hey guys im still trapped in the vines  laura oh scanlan i run over and i start pulling the vines off of him holy shit scanlan  im so sorry thank you for healing me  sam certainly  travis are you in fine form should i hit you until you  sam no dont hit me ill sing more spice girls  laura that was really lovely  sam thank you  
none	 laura spice girls is so empowering  matt so you pull the vines from him as you inspect around too you notice theres not much  really of worth here this home is mostly natural in its base however the slow trickle of the  black oillike substance has ceased most of its grown thicker and stopped and it just feels like  the whole place went into this sudden stasis like the slow crawl of everything nearby  the vines everything stopped  laura we didnt kill the whole forest did we  sam little bit  marisha i 
none	 drop to my knees and do a commune with nature  matt okay  marisha do i gather a different energy from the surrounding plants  matt you still feel the everpresent bloom of life and lifeforces surrounding you entirely  you do feel a wave of relaxation there is a sort of general radial sigh that is slowly trickling  from the center of the tree  marisha do i still sense the presence of sondur  matt no  marisha do last question does the tree seem happier what is the tree gonna do from here on  
none	 out what are you gonna do tree  matt exist  marisha exist cool everything seems great  travis cool since i got the killing blow can i chop this tree down now  laura this whole tree  marisha this big one  sam no its just a tree now i think its okay  marisha yeah you know the tree just told me that it actually feels much better so  travis i get to chop a tree at some point  laura you see those trees over there  travis theyre already down  laura no no 
none	 no i see it twitching grog its definitely twitching  liam were going to vasselheim soon you can cut down a lot of trees there its cold there  they could use the firewood soon  marisha trees that wont take it personal  taliesin i know thats not nearly as much fun but it is available  travis this is true  liam what are we talking about vexahlia  laura what  liam im fucking curious pull that bowstring  laura well i dont have it  taliesin toss it  sam are you sure vexahlia should get 
dung	 it  taliesin i know i was thinking that  laura do you need it scanlan do you think  sam i think maybe i should get it i fought bravely in the last fight  laura you did maybe grog should get it i mean he did get the killing blow  liam scanlan i think you would make a very good arrow for it  all laugh  travis i could get down with that  matt you hold it in your hand and look at it the handle is wrapped with a very tight dark  brown 
none	 black leather and at the cusp of where the handle itself is and where the arrow is notched is  this nice goldenbronze caplike metallic inlay the rest of the bow itself is this curved  almost deep verdant green jungle vinetype texture to it where it builds on itself like a  series of natural leaf scales and as it curves into the ends of the actual recurve bow  as you hold it it flexes and shifts on its own it actually looks as you hold it it almost seems  to tighten and then relax and then 
none	 as you reach back an arrow it goes taut and the string goes  extremely tight as you pull the arrow back its like no strength involved at all  laura what  matt it pulls back on its own and as soon as you release the arrow that you fire shoots off at an  incredible speed and the actual bow itself flexes with such intensity that it makes this roaring  whoosh sound with each shot  taliesin well thats exciting  laura thats really badass  travis you wanna shoot me with it  laura i wanna 
none	 shoot everything with it  liam do you still need muscle strength to pull it or is it just easypeasy now  laura its kind of easypeasy i guess anybody could pull this  liam youre going to have to start doing pushups then  laura laughs i guess i did say  marisha do you want to hit something here im  sam do you want to shoot me ill be okay  laura im not going to shoot you  sam ill be okay you shot me before  laura no  sam right here  taliesin you 
none	 dont know what it does  laura oh look at that scar its beautiful  travis can we get out of this fucking tree first  laura youre right we should probably get out of here maybe  sam guys life needs things to live  all laugh  taliesin i had not had my coffee i was tired there was no bacon  sam and we are those things i think weve all learned a lot today  laura weve learned so much  taliesin i hate you so much  travis i walk out of the tree  
none	 taliesin i need fresh air im done  laura what does it look like outside of the tree is the black muck still black mucky  matt i mean the whole forest is still just coated in this horrible thick liquid  travis did you loot sondurs body  taliesin i did but it wasnt much  matt but when you approached and you inspected the tree there was just an everconstant flow of  it of this thick molassestype material just slowly drifting down the tree you look down  and a lot of it seems to have stopped 
none	 and is hardening almost like an amber  laura okay  travis like jurassic park  taliesin this is good  sam cracks up  laura yeah at least its not burying the forest anymore  taliesin no we did very well  sam sweet  taliesin lets go home  marisha you guys ready to go home  taliesin im well do we wanna is there a reason to stay or is it time to go home  laura lets get out of here  marisha i think ive seen enough of the feywild for now  taliesin im

none	 then we just shoot out of the feywild how about no  sam all right  travis anybody want to climb to the top of the 200foot tree to see what the rest of the land  looks like  matt clapping  liam i fly up there  sam oh wait someones here  matt you hear slow clapping from nearby  marisha that cant be good  laura oh no  matt as you look off to the side of the tree rounding the bend you see a very tall and thin  chestforward regalposed almost elflike but 
none	 still exaggerated in the feylike features  long ears that curl past the head the head itself is small with a pointed chin the eyes  almondshaped and wild curly orange hair like a lions mane that goes down to the lower back  just up and large curves up at the very tip you see sleeveless silk vestments of blue and  green billowing freely behind him as he walks up clapping  laura i instantly case cure wounds on myself again  matt all right  laura at a level three  matt how much do you heal 
none	  laura 13 plus eight is 25  matt there you go 25  liam garmelie  laura no thats wrong 21  matt bravo everyone  sam who is this  matt bravo to each and every one of you its been fun to watch you know i get so  disinterested in these lands and i have to say im impressed well i wish to say adieu  good luck on your journeys  laura who are you  matt but i am a simple wanderer an individual who sees the landscape for artistic benefit  taliesin i
