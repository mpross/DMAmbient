none	 the wanderer  taliesin no but i know of groo we dont know groo well enough to really delve in  sam if you do an episode on groo thats the one ill watch  taliesin not the one youll be on  sam no no no ill watch it though  taliesin youll watch it then  sam yeah yeah im not going to go on your show  taliesin okay  laughter  sam i could bring my comic collection on your show and show it off  travis you have a comic collection  sam yeah man 
none	  travis more than ten more than ten comics  sam yeah ive got some good books man  taliesin you gave me that really good comic book for was it christmas last year or the year  before because i read it in colorado it was really nice  matt save your rolls laura  laura i had to test it  matt i know i know you do  laura that was the joedice  matt oh there you go  laura hes making it into the battle  matt there you go you need to know whos 
none	 in your corner laura  laura thats right  matt all righty guys if we dont have anything else to discuss were going to go ahead and dive  into tonights episode of critical role  dramatic music  matt all right and welcome back everybody so as part of tonights battle royale a couple of  things that i want to put out there one because were at higher power levels it may go quickly  if it goes quickly we may do a second round which keep in mind whatever alliances or  betrayals you endure that first 
none	 round will probably be remembered for the second  laura wait wait wait were we supposed to make alliances  sam oh yeah we all made alliances we all made alliances laura  laughter  sam its all four of us against you  travis yeah raise your hand if youre on team right  marisha table right  matt laura have you played risk  laura yes  matt risk is a game where you make alliances and then doublecross people it doesnt say it in the  rules but thats how it always happens thats what i assume 
none	 will probably happen it may not  you guys may surprise me im just saying be prepared  laura and travis singing be prepared  matt laughing okay now im voting for that table all right guys the other thing i want to  mention is whoever the victor is will get a minor prize a very very minor prize  laura what is it do we get to know what it is  taliesin a nintendo switch  matt playstation 2 no you will get a fate die that you get to carry over  into the main campaign 
none	  its a single reroll  sam that could come in handy  matt its like a luck point  travis well fuck no my lighthearted self is now changed  laura you already have fate dice you have a fucking deck of many things you have an entire  plethora of fate dice  travis that is not the same theres like a seven percent chance i even pull  something even close to that  taliesin im with travis on this one its just not the same no  travis thats a big prize  laura enjoy the 
none	 fate die keyleth or grog  travis yeah like when you choose to become a goldfish from a thousand feet  marisha yeah that would have been great to have then mmhm so clutch  taliesin is this your first battle royale so what happens though is that the people who are  obviously the problem often get targeted first and then itll be other people who somehow have  all their hit points in round four  sam oh thats happening guys youre going to forget i existed  marisha mr lootdrop over here  taliesin mr lootdrop may 
none	 go down early  travis mr carepackage  matt as you all comfortably find yourself resting falling into sleep and darkness for the  evening in the city of whitestone over some point in the break of the yearlong period you  find yourself your eyes opening bleary blinking towards what appears to be a grey  cloudcovered sky you look about and find yourselves somewhat scattered amongst an  unfamiliar battlefield travis i want you to go ahead and roll a d6 for me please  travis oh god okay  laura this is serious this is serious  
none	 travis a two  matt a two okay  laura oh my god i was just looking at the topview i didnt realize that  those are fucking towers  matt yeah so thats you there  travis okay okay  matt laura go ahead and roll a d6  laura panting okay six  matt a six with trinket there  laura oh god oh with trinket up there  marisha exactly where the ranger should be  matt all right marisha roll a d6  sam first roll of the night  marisha four  matt four all 
none	 righty taliesin  taliesin four  matt roll again  taliesin three  matt okay go ahead and roll a d6  sam one  laura look at us spreading out our numbers  matt all righty so as you take in the scenery around you seemingly no rhyme or reason you  wonder how you transported to this space taryon in particular you find that you seem to be a  little more viable power than you were when you went to bed that night you watch as a singular  cloaked figure seems to emerge from the clouds 
none	 above you and slowly fall from the sky as the  entity you see arms out hood up the wind blowing around causing the cloth to flap and curl  about them the hood blows back and you see before you a  sam its me vax  laughter  sam hey everybody i can fly 200000 feet in one second  matt so if we ever do a liveaction vox machina film we get owen wilson to play vax so as the  figure descends to about this point in the center of the battlefield you watch as the 
none	 wind blows the  hood back and you see there a handsome man with immaculate somewhat earlength brown hair and a  magnificent beard as he smiles and looks around and goes tonight you fight for me and my  pleasure for i am the forgotten deity known as colville  laughter  matt and you will dance before me and between you all one victor shall stand and gain my  blessing at which point he raises his hand and you watch as a force field of energy suddenly  whoosh warps around and encapsulates around it also zeroing 
none	 off the top about there so there is  a height limit to this chamber right across there about 20 feet up  from the base of this tower  sam which are 30 feet tall 20 feet tall  matt these are 30 feet tall  marisha so about 50 feet up  matt 50 feet up yeah you watch as he grins and smiles i hope you all learn something now you  have six seconds to decide where to go and what to prepare for no fighting is to commence until  these six seconds are up 
none	 and then show me what youve got  laughter  laura so wait we can cast things in these six seconds  matt you can cast or prepare anything you want to an action or movement or bonus that doesnt  attack or assault another person for the first round but first lets roll initiative guys  laura oh my gosh  taliesin yeah  sam im feeling lucky thats terrible  matt all righty  sam thats one luck down  matt so 25 to 20  taliesin 29  travis what the fuck man  taliesin aint gonna 
none	 have a repeat of last time  matt all righty laughs thats right yeah  taliesin i was just low enough if i had been above liam that would have been the end of him  but he hid  matt all right 20 to 15  laura 19  travis 16  marisha 16  matt okay vex and then keyleth and grog interesting  sam you need a tie breaker  matt i think so ill have you guys both roll dexterity checks for me please just roll a d20  travis just normal dex rolls or just 
none	 straight up  matt just roll a d20 and add your dex modifier  travis okay 20  marisha four  matt so we have vex then grogkeyleth all righty and then tary  sam oh sorry nine  matt all righty which by the way you also have  sam doty  matt doty at your disposal at the top  sam yes  marisha are you at the top of the tower too  sam im on that tower shes on the other tower  laura wait a minute heres my question did we see where everybody landed 
none	 could we see  everybody when we came down or did we just see the guy  matt you guys just saw the guy and you just got your vision around so this round is going to be  running and taking in your surroundings and doing what youre going to do to prepare from where you  are right now you can barely see somebody well say as part of this round  you guys get a feel for it  marisha as part of this round we what  matt you get a feel for where everyone else 
none	 is as part of this first round  travis on the towers on the far ends of the map is there a back entrance to the tower  or just the door  matt just the doors there or climbing upward and there appears to be a trapdoor on either side  travis going up  matt theres a ladder ladder and a chain  laura when he said you have six seconds i immediately duck down and cast pass without a  trace on myself and trinket  matt okay so well get to your turn percival youre up 
none	 first  taliesin im going to activate the boots of spider climbing should knock that out im going  to charge diplomacy and then im going to  travis cant hide  sam what is that a rule  travis no im just talking shit  taliesin i aint hiding  sam im hiding  talisin im going to climb up to the top of that building thats right over there  matt which one this one  taliesin that little hut  matt okay so you climb up  marisha is that a hut is that what those are 
none	  matt theyre little stone bunkerlike structures theres an entrance on this side and  on this side  marisha shit  taliesin actually how far i have a counting six one two three four five  marisha its like a paintball arena  matt so its half your movement thats 15 feet you can move 15 more feet if you want to  taliesin yeah let me get just one step back or so  matt there  taliesin still at the edge on the other side though to your right  matt okay here okay so there you 
none	 are  taliesin yeah and boots are activated diplomacy is activated  matt boots are activated diplomacy is activated perfect all right just after percy goes you  watch as all the flickering braziers the flames flicker bright you see these two glowing towers  that are slowly spinning the blue crystals crackling noises little sparks and each of  these pillars gives off a slight hum vex its your turn  laura its like a trapped thing this is so hunger games oh shit okay im going to cast  pass without a trace on me and trinket and 
none	 im going to send him down is there a trapdoor or  like a stairway around that he can go down  matt there is a trapdoor that he can go down and then make his way  laura hes going to make his way down but i am going to hide at the top here  behind one of those  matt behind one of those okay go ahead and make a stealth check and trinket makes it well say  halfway down the tunnel with trinkets full movement there so down the stairs and hes  halfway through 
none	 the tower there  laura so my stealth is 30  matt okay good to know nobody else has any idea where you are right now  laura solid  matt at the moment all right that brings us to grog  travis grunts i would like to rage just oh so angry i dont like people putting me in  strange places and floating down from the clouds colville can i equip yeah fuck it fuck it  im going to stick with the bloodaxe not the dwarven thrower  matt okay bloodaxe oof  travis i know i 
none	 know that might be a poor choice oh you motherfuckers can fly  taliesin i cant  travis bullshit youre climbing up shit with spider boots you know what no dwarven thrower  dwarven thrower and can i start to climb the little rope ladder thats next to me  matt yes you can make an athletics check  travis i just want to get a good lay of the land i dont even know anybodys up there 15  sam the glasses are clutch  matt you rage get up and just crest over the top  laura oh 
none	 shit youre already there  sam screaming he sleeps in war paint why would he sleep in war paint  matt he rageclimbs the ladder one rung over the other and with the rest of his movement gets to  the very top of the tower  travis do i have a bonus action  matt well your bonus action was rage  travis oh thats right never mind  matt if you have an action you want to do that doesnt involve attacking or hurting anybody  travis i blow a snot rocket when i get to the top 
none	  matt okay you watch as a large globule of goliath snot slaps the ground in front of you and  skids a bit leaving a trail  sam oh man  travis dexterity check  sam its like a cicada  laughter  matt all right is that your turn grog keyleth youre up  marisha oh god it begins can i just run up and just check that water right in front of me  and really fast put my foot in it and see if i can see how deep it goes  laura and you die 
none	  travis no no let her do it  marisha let me take my staff and just put my staff down a little bit  matt okay your staff dips down and it goes about it keeps going its pretty deep  marisha its pretty deep  matt to the point where you get like to the very edge of your staff holding it there and it  manages to go all the way in  marisha oh i touch the bottom now though  matt yeah well you havent felt the bottom yet any more and youre  going 
none	 to submerge your hands  marisha okay im going to cast freedom of movement on myself and then can i move around to  this side hereish this side hereish over here and hide  matt and move over this way well youre not hiding you dont have anything left to do a hide  action but you move there  marisha thats fine  matt okay all right so taryon  sam everyone else has gone  matt yeah  sam i have a lot to do  matt all right what are you doing  sam number one 
none	 how much does doty weigh  matt at his size id say he weighs somewhere in the range of 700 pounds  sam fuck that changes things  matt he is somewhat hollow in places though  travis build him out of aluminium  matt no hes large and hes heavy metallic substances but he is hollow in places so id  actually say hes probably closer to 500 maybe 400 to 500  sam still anything over 400 bones my strategy so its okay were okay plan number two okay i  say doty i need you to carry 
none	 me away from all the bad people remember how we played keepaway  as children were playing that now keep me away from everybody  matt tary  sam yes i cast sanctuary on doty i think i can do that yeah okay and then for my action i will  throw down the bead of force on myself and enclose myself in the bubble  marisha youre going to be a guy in a hamster ball being carried around by robot  sam i take 5d4 damage  laura thats pretty smart  marisha its pretty awesome  travis 
none	 you take 5d4 damage  laura just putting yourself in the ball  sam uhhuh  laura thats smart you know what and then we cant hurt you  sam not for a minute  laura oh shit  sam i got ten rounds yall see ya  marisha is it totally invulnerable type of shit  sam yes  laura unless somebody can dispel it or something  matt only breathable air can pass through the spheres wall no attack or other effect can  sam it says no magic can pass within or without the space it doesnt 
town	 say that i cant do magic in  the sphere it just says it cant leave the sphere  matt correct so you can cast things on yourself within but nothing can pass by however you are  at the mercy of whoever has control of the ball at the moment so yes  marisha so wait but you cant cast spells out either  travis you ever see those sporting events where the beach balls just going  around the fucking crowd  laura so wait only air can pass through it huh  sam breathable air not poison 
none	 air  marisha if i was an air elemental could i go into the sphere just conjecturing  matt i dont know if youre considered breathable as an air elemental  marisha yeah but im a breath of fresh air  matt taryon as you slam into the ground how much damage do you take  sam ill roll six seven eight nine points of damage  matt thats not too bad you take nine points of damage and the sphere encapsulates you and you  begin to roll forward slightly as doty walks over grabs you and pulls you 
none	 back about there to the  edge not sure what to do hes just holding you now in this ball  sam sure  matt tary confused all right at the end of that turn you watch over as colville floating in  the center goes and now my champions let the fight begin slams his hands together and you watch  him vanish in a burst of thunder as it cracks around the landscape and you feel this energy  pulse you all at once as the battle has begun percival youre up first  taliesin who can i 
none	 see  sam grogs head  matt you can barely see part of grog with threequarters cover barely  taliesin i can barely see grog with threequarters cover  matt everyone else looks apparently at the moment not really in your line of sight  taliesin thats fine thats my first shot then lets just take a couple shots at grog  matt okay  taliesin you know if you hadnt made it all the way up that tower youd be in intense trouble right  now okay just pointing that out  matt you have sharpshooter so you ignore

none	 hit  matt yeah that hits all right so one animus shot and then one bad news shot  taliesin one animus shot one bad news shot and i also take really quickly  i take a little damage  matt you take 2d6 psychic right  taliesin 2d6 psychic damage five six seven seven points of psychic damage did i no it  doesnt matter anyway because i was going to call hex but ill do it later fuck it all right  lets roll im also going to run some cabals ruin into this just for fun  
none	 matt okay  taliesin so lets do the first one is 1d10  matt so do cabals ruin damage at the end because that is not halved  taliesin yeah so 1d10 plus 1d6 so first shot is ten points of piercing damage and four points  of psychic damage  matt ten points of piercing damage so thats reduced to five and then how many points of  psychic four points of psychic seven points of damage  taliesin then the bad news is  matt wait ten points its nine it was ten points piercing reduced to five 
none	 and then four  psychic so thats nine  travis oh and the psychics not reduced thats right  taliesin so thats cocked thats seven eight nine ten 11 17 points of piercing damage  matt okay so take that down to eight  taliesin and lets just three four five six seven eight nine this is not halved is it  matt nope  travis the psychic  matt no this is cabals ruin hes pumping you full of lightning damage  taliesin im going to empty cabals ruin into him  matt okay thats how many d6s

none	 intensifies spin up you hear this crackling noise and you watch as each of these  four towers suddenly gives off this intense vibration around it as youre walking you feel  this force pulling on you like being within a certain radius of this is forcing you to move  slower grunting thats all vex your turn  laura okay i can see grog as well because im assuming his head is above those parapets  matt yes he does have halfcover from you currently  laura i have sharpshooter so he does not  matt all right  
none	 laura im going to send trinket down  matt so trinket does manage to get all the way to the bottom and emerges from the front door  there but thats as far as trinket can get with his movement  laura trinkets like confused bear sound  travis arent you concerned with the love of your life running across the courtyard  laura i cant see him hes hidden like from my field of view im assuming i cant really see  him can i see percy  matt percy yeah you can see percy from there  laura

none	 since you used skirmisher stealth  laura i know i dont remember yeah its a ranger thing  travis this fight started and im like machine gun fire the fucking godfather just  screaming  matt basically youre not wrong  taliesin i hit you with a ball of lightning man like a tesla coil  travis i climb up to the top of the tower like whats going on machine gun fire  matt at the start of your turn you pick a creature to remain hidden from  not a general hiding  laura oh so i could 
none	 say im keeping hidden from percy  matt yep but everybody else can still see you  laura and then i would roll for stealth to hide from everybody else  matt if you wanted to make the hide action  laura im going to keep hidden from percy for skirmisher stealth and then im going to roll for  stealth and i got a 24 to hide from everybody else  matt okay good to know now you guys are aware shes there you just cannot shoot her or attack  her from this distance necessarily all right that 
none	 ends your turn  laura yeah  matt grog mr pincushion what are you doing  travis i take the titanstone knuckles and i smash them together and i cast enlarge on myself is  doty up there with you  sam oh sure hes holding me in a ball  matt like a giant hamster ball  laughter  taliesin do it  laura is this teetime  travis can i go into a frenzied rage  matt yeah  travis and can i try and shove doty off of the top of the tower  matt yes you 
none	 may  sam youll have to succeed a wisdom saving throw first  matt yes you do  travis my wisdom aint bad my intelligence is dickall  matt make a wisdom saving throw  travis okay 14  matt nope so you go to shove him and you go groan  travis oh because hes got sanctuary on himself  laura thats what earthbreaker groon had  matt yep thats what earthbreaker groon did to you  travis understood  sam you can still make the attack you just have to point it at someone else  travis interesting 
none	 i choose to urinate all over no  taliesin does the ball count as someone else or just doty  matt you can attack the ball but it does nothing  sam well itll throw me away  travis interesting interesting i dont learn lessons very well im going to try again one  more time i get three attacks so  matt okay so youre going to do the second shove attack  travis yep  matt wisdom save  travis 17  sam i mean thats it dc 17  matt okay so now getting dotys sheet out 
none	 here for a shove attack i believe its a contested  athletics check let me doublecheck real fast  travis okay not strength but athletics  matt pretty sure im sure the internet right now is going no its this god damn it mercer  no its athletics contested by athletics so go ahead and roll an athletics check grog with  advantage because youre raging  travis thats higher  matt roll a d20 add four for doty  sam 14  travis 24  sam goofystyle screaming  matt you watch as doty turns to grog goes tary 
none	 bang and end over end gets shoved off  the parapet slamming onto the ground prone here at the bottom of the chain you taryon fly off  boing harmlessly and roll into the middle of the pool and are currently now on your side  sam floating is it like at ren faire im in one of those balls  matt for the 30foot fall doty takes 11 points of bludgeoning damage  sam still alive hes fine  matt and is prone chuckles  travis i have some movement left  matt you do you have 40 feet 
none	 of movement left  travis right is there a trap door at the top of the tower  matt there is yes  travis would i need an action or a bonus to be able to open it to go down into it  matt it would be an action to lift it up  travis i have one well i have an attack okay can i move to the  matt actually its not that much because its not locked or anything you can probably just pull  it open  travis yeah id like to go into the 
none	 tower stairs  matt okay so with the rest of your movement 40 feet you can get almost to the bottom so youre  partway through that  travis and im still inside right  matt yeah youre still inside  travis great as long as no one can yeah  matt all right that ends your turn grog keyleth your turn  travis fucking hamster ball piece of shit  matt thats so awesome  sam i might be alive for a long time after youre all dead  marisha thats kind of true ten rounds thats a long 
none	 fucking time okay question the radius of  the energy field sound effect i have freedom of movement do i seem to not be affected by that  matt you seem to not be affected by it actually you see it there and as you push forward a little  bit with your hand it doesnt seem to be the gravitational shift isnt affecting you  marisha cool im going to move up and forward this direction  matt up this way  marisha yeah one two three stop right there  matt right there on the edge  marisha 
none	 do i see doty  matt you can just barely see the edge of doty right past these you see his head on the ground  you see taryon in the middle and you see percival right there  laura i like the idea of seeing tary like  marisha i can move one more square correct  matt you can move three more squares if you want to  sam the inside of the ball is all puke smeared everywhere  marisha okay move me up to the doorway up one more  matt okay you can look inside 
none	 now you see a small chamber and what appears to be a small  chest against the wall there and this area is just an open space  laura oh fuck is there loot  travis you shut your damn mouth  laura and im up top fuck  marisha thats good to know  taliesin you have a beacon its a very nice beacon  laura i do have a beacon i have a feeling that beacon is going to attack us  taliesin its probably going to attack us  travis no its so benignly designed  marisha 
none	 im going to on top of doty cast a 5thlevel flaming sphere  matt laughing okay boom so you watch as suddenly spiraling out of the air this swirl of  fire forms into a large burning ball of flame that begins to collide and burn and singe into  dotys squealing metal prone form on the ground still reeling from the impact of being knocked off  the tower thats 5d6 damage go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw for doty i think its  dexterity right  marisha hes prone  matt prone doesnt change your dexterity 
none	 saving throw  sam oh i rolled a 16 plus dexterity of zero so 16  matt that does not make her dc unfortunately so thats 5d6 points of fire damage against doty  marisha 18 20 21 22 22 and then  matt 22 points of fire damage  sam sure sure  marisha i dont get any other bonuses okay im going to say sorry tary and then go whoosh  and go fire elemental form and hope that this isnt a mistake  travis please be nothing but black powder in the chest  marisha wouldnt hurt 
none	 me none  matt just tary explosion just a white flash like akira opening  marisha can i do any more movement with my elemental form  matt you know what you had ten feet of movement left  marisha im going to pop into the room  matt so ill say boom boom there you go so you flicker inside and you are currently contained  on the inside there  laura ooh with the roof on there and everything  matt oh yeah its all sorts of held up there for you so that ends your turn keyleth 
none	 taryon  you are floating in a sphere over a pool of murky green liquid  sam end of round one okay action prep my healing draught just pour it into a bottle and  get it ready to rock bonus click my boots of speed  matt boots of speed clicked  sam movement rapid vibration sound effect  travis like sonic the hedgehog  sam with my boots of speed on and the feat that i took ive got 80 feet of movement  travis have you ever run in one of those balls on the water they 
none	 dont go anywhere man  sam shh its shooting water everywhere its spraying it on keyleth  matt you have 80 feet of movement on the sphere however the sphere is half your movement to push  it so you get to push it 40 feet  sam but im also in water and i dont know if it has any friction or anything  matt right now on the water you get about that far  sam hey i moved  matt straining sound its splashing behind the balls coasting and youre almost three two feet  from the 
none	 edge of the rock and youre like oh god oh god the sweats starting to pour from  your brow  travis youre vomiting inside the sphere  taliesin like the worst spin art ever  marisha throwing up the wine you drank earlier  matt all right and whats doty going to do  sam i cant communicate with him i dont think i dont think sound can escape so hes going to  keep doing what i told him to do get to me and keep me away from other people  matt trapped inside the sphere it 
none	 doesnt say anything about it making silence or blocking  sound so you can still communicate  travis does sanctuary stay on doty now or does it go away when i hit him  matt sanctuary once you get an attack  sam it lasts a minute  matt it lasts a minute until  sam it doesnt say if he gets hit it ends  matt im pretty sure its until the creature attacks yes until the warded creature takes an  attack so right now it still has sanctuary on  sam okay but if he attacks hell 
none	 lose it  matt yes  sam im going to tell him to do that get to me and get me away from other people this is a  suicide mission for doty guys this is not going to end well for him  taliesin dotys not going to win this  matt thats a valid point and reminder it probably will be fine but keyleth i shouldve  remembered because he did have sanctuary  sam no its okay because hers was an area of effect  matt no it wasnt you target it to ram into something it 
none	 wasnt a fireball  marisha i have to make a wisdom saving throw  matt wisdom saving throw because it says target with a harmful spell so yes  marisha ive got crazy high wisdom 22  matt youre fine i just wanted to double check on that because i totally forgot about the  sanctuary but still warded with sanctuary getting up half movement so doty has 20 more  feet to move i think speed of 40 what do you want doty to do  sam get to me and push me away  matt okay so dotys

none	 them you  watch as the corners of the battlefield are suddenly engulfed in flames briefly then the  flames retract back into just very gently burning braziers  taliesin i love it this is like battlebots  matt vex youre up  laura okay grogs coming for me  travis no  laura first of all trinkets going to just wade out into that water to get no longer on fire  matt okay well trinket first takes three points of fire damage at the top of the round trinket  wades into the water and does manage to 
none	 put out the fire however trinket does take  laura damn it its acid or something what is it  matt  does take six points of acid damage  travis ooh that shits not water its acid  matt nope it is not water  travis he called that shit poop  matt as trinket wades in he goes acid sounds hurt bear sounds  laura no trinket goes ow ow and then he comes back out  matt he gets back out of the water and hes like you see like the sizzling off of him  laura 
none	 trinket i didnt even tell you to do that you just did that on your own and then  matt if a bear could shrug  laura yeah you know and then im going to get on my broom  matt what is a whale  laura whats a whale i get on my broom and i want to fly up and over above grog  matt okay so you whoosh over and as you get up you almost bump into the ceiling  where that tower is  laura actually could i actually get to grog if i was 
none	 flying  matt if you were flying from here you could get right over there and see him on the ground yeah  laura i couldnt get down to him though  matt you could get right down to him  laura oh this is going to be the worst move ever if it doesnt work im going to get down to where  grog is this is so stupid though no because if it doesnt work i cant get away because thats  all my movement isnt it  travis lets team up you and me  matt what 
none	 are you doing  laura you want to team up i go down to grog and i say lets shake on it  but i take my necklace off and i put it into my hand  taliesin and marisha oh  matt make a deception check  travis which is not hard  laura oh its a one whatever i still try to touch it to him whatever he doesnt do it  matt right so grog do you accept it  travis no  matt okay she still touches it to you but youre not willing  so 
dung	 whats the saving throw on that  laura its a wisdom saving throw  travis you sneaky  laura its only a ten  travis thats okay its not a high modifier thats a five  matt suction sound grog you are absorbed into a familiar dark stony throne room staring out  through this small open space almost like a personalized movie theater of  the outside of the necklace  travis how do i get out  laura you cant unless i release you  matt she has to release you mind you vex the battle cannot be 
none	 won until all the other people  have been defeated this is not considered defeat  taliesin you could release him into the acid though  laura hey man my minds already there  matt remember just be aware if youre the last one standing after everything else happens and you  release grog hes going to destroy you so think tactically  laura yes i plan on it believe me im going to use my bonus action to stay hidden from for my  skirmisher stealth can i pick a target i want to stay hidden from keyleth  
none	 matt okay you cannot because in order to get there your full movement leaves you right in the  doorway where she can see you you literally landed did that to grog and turned over your  shoulder and see a giant fire elemental looking right at you  laura great so i cant use my bonus action to hide because shes right there  matt yep because youre not behind anything  laura tight im going to then use my skirmisher to stay hidden from percy  and ive got nothing i can do  travis fuck fuck like 
none	 a rat in a cage  matt youre just groans  taliesin i imagine this as the interior of the genie bottle from i dream of jeannie  pink and plush  travis really i was picturing something from saw like the inside is just awful  matt the inside is essentially a 20by20foot cold stone room with a central stone throne and  the view you have is this tenfootbyfivefoot slit window that looks out from the necklace  travis is it fisheyed  matt no its just a perspective this is what galdrick the wolf had been looking 
none	 through for  hundreds of years and what trinket looks through whenever hes trapped thats your turn vex  keyleth youre up what are you doing  marisha oh shit  sam its like prison you could do some pushups  travis im going to rocky montage this shit wait are you skipping me  matt oh thats right youre up next grog what do you want to do  travis im going to flip the fuck out im inside of a goddamn box im going to take my dwarven  thrower and throw it as hard as i can 
none	 at the window  matt okay go ahead and roll an attack  travis yep reckless yep almost a natural 20 26  matt go ahead and roll damage  travis awesome im getting out of here in no time 25  matt all right damage  travis yeah 25 damage  matt okay good you are also technically sieged because of your gauntlets  travis thats right double damage  matt all right as you slam your axe into the front of this you watch as the stone rumble  quakes a little bit and a little bit of 
none	 dust hiss settles from the ceiling  taliesin oh my god  travis oh really  laura he could bust out of the necklace  travis yeah this is also matt mercer who had us fight an entire thing taking down damage the  whole time while nothing was happening ill take all three attacks at the window reckless  matt go ahead and roll attack  travis natural 20  laura does that mean if i put an actual monster inside of it during the game  that they could break out  sam you dont know  taliesin 
none	 theyd have to think of it i wouldnt think of attacking the room and hes designed to  hurt rooms  laura and hes designed to not think  matt hes designed to make terrible choices  taliesin the room could collapse and squish him like a bug for all we know  travis that critical is 55  matt so thats 110 points of damage with your siege weaponry  laura im so dead you guys hes going to pop out  matt as you rear back for your second strike you bring your axe to go against this 
none	 crystalline  field this layer that defends you from that as you slam it the axe hits and you watch as it  spidercracks cracking all across and the room rumbling is now actively shaking as you look  around you can see that the walls are starting to crumble and rocks begin to tumble and you see  what looks like a black void behind the cracks that are opening  laura oh no that could be really bad  matt you have a third attack grog what are you going to do mr raging  taliesin oh god 
none	 i love watching his brain strain  matt what are you going to do  travis fuck it  laura oh shit  travis natural 20  marisha no way you are lying  travis no its true  laura what if you get sucked into a random void then we can never defeat you  matt roll some damage  marisha if he gets sucked into a random void i imagine that would be considered defeat  matt oh he would be fucking dead  travis 60 this time so 120  matt so 120 points of damage so 
none	 grog you rear back once more and that little bit of doubt in  the back of your brain you quickly squash as your frenzied fury takes over you see nothing but  red anger and blood as you rear back a third time and whack as you slam it you hear what  sounds like a thousand windows shattering at once and all the walls suddenly collapse in towards  you rocketing and spiraling inward it crushes into your body as youre thrust forward as the  crystalline structure ahead of you shatters and pulls you through like a 
none	 heavy vacuum  laura oh god hes out  sam or hes dead  matt you suffer 26 points of piercing and bludgeoning damage  travis halved to 13  matt halved to 13  sam thats not bad  travis and imploded from the inside  matt and the necklace in front of you shattering shatters off your chest and you  watch as a giant grog right there into the hallway right in front of you  marisha oh shit so much just happened  travis because i reference terminator 2 later  taliesin you punched a hole 
none	 through time and space well done  matt your necklace is gone it is not functional for the rest of this battle i was not expecting  you to attack the inside of the wall  travis i was just going to do it because hes an idiot but that really worked  matt all righty that ends your turn grog  travis yeah  matt keyleth youre up  laura i was going to release you  sam in acid  marisha okay im going to turn around and be like screams booming on both of these guys im 
none	  going to move into vexs space and then attack grog bam bam  matt go for it youre technically occupying vexs space right there  marisha correct  matt so you attack  marisha 15  travis misses  marisha second one much better that hits 16 plus six is 22  matt 22 that hits yeah so go ahead and roll damage against vex vex you also catch fire  marisha oh im attacking grog  matt oh grog i misunderstood sorry so grog you catch fire flames are just whoosh  sam youre having a weird six 
none	 seconds of your life right now  travis i know panting warp sound effect screaming hulk angry  marisha thats 20 fire damage  matt so you take 20 points of fire damage reduced to ten and youre on fire and you will  remain on fire taking 1d10 fire damage every round until you spend an action to put it out  sam but it looks cool  matt but it looks cool all right and because you moved into vexs space vex you also catch  fire automatically does she immediately take the 1d10 damage for occupying someones 
none	 space  marisha the first time it enters a creatures space on a turn that creature takes 1d10 fire  damage and catches fire  matt okay so roll 1d10 damage for vex technically both of them because you had to move  into both of their spaces to do it so you take another 1d10 damage grog  marisha five for vex and four for grog  matt all right so grog you take two points of fire damage vex you take five  travis can i make my retaliation strike after her melee on me  matt yes 
none	 you can  travis okay reckless wheres the crit now thats what i want to know  matt actually thats a valid point go ahead and roll because he did reckless attack last turn  travis oh yeah you do get advantage  marisha oh on that first one again nope  matt okay so whats your attack roll  travis it is a 22  matt yeah that hits go ahead and roll damage  marisha this is going to hurt  travis nah youre fine no thats going to hurt im just kidding yeah 25 thats it  
none	 matt 25 points of damage to your fire elemental form  marisha okay is that halved because its bludgeoning no his weapons magical  matt you take full damage however doesnt he take damage whenever he  marisha yeah when he attacks me he takes another 1d10 damage  travis good to know  marisha sorry im an asshole eight  matt so you take four points of fire damage all righty keyleth so thats your action youve  moved 15 feet to get into vexs and grogs space  marisha okay im going to back out and around again 
none	 through the room  matt okay so thats 15 20 25 30 youre going to stay in the room  marisha do i have any more  matt yes you have 20 more feet of movement from here  marisha yeah let me go out one more and onto this lip next to trinket  matt there  marisha and im going to take my bonus action to take my flaming sphere and i want to jump it over  this shallow end on this far side ive got cameras right in front of me it can jump over a 
none	  tenfoot gap  matt how much does it move  marisha 30 can it get ten more feet over  matt 25 30 itll get just about there  marisha to the edge if it looks like its not going to land in the acid and extinguish it or  something weird  matt it looks like itll probably land in the acid  marisha would it extinguish it  matt probably  marisha then ill keep it there on the edge  matt next round it can it doesnt have the movement for the full jump unfortunately so 
none	 its  right there on the edge fire noises angrily burning i need you to make a concentration check  by the way with advantage for the damage that grog hit you  marisha yeah ill take that 16 what do i have to get over  matt its a constitution saving throw and you have to beat half his damage that he did to you  marisha so he did 25 damage  matt so 12 half  marisha so yeah im good  matt that ends your turn keyleth taryon  sam oh hi im going to read 
none	 my scroll of fire shield setting it to a warm shield that will  protect me from all cold damage and last for ten minutes  travis no one can hurt you in there anyway right  sam oh but when i get out  matt wait so your scroll of fire shield you said  sam fire shield  matt okay yeah thats ten minutes not concentration so you said warm shield which  gives you resistance to cold damage  sam correct  matt okay  sam thats what i want because im already resistant to fire damage 
none	  and then ill roll my ball  matt all right youve got 40 feet of movement  sam im just going towards that corner  matt here  sam no top right and ill also pull out my rod and ill say crossbow  matt clang turns into a nice crossbow  sam and ill load it with a bolt  matt all right clicking thats your turn all right top of the round  percy what are you doing  taliesin pulling around the corner  matt around here  taliesin yep  matt all right you turn 
none	 the corner  taliesin casting hex on grog  matt grog is now hexed and on fire  taliesin and now im going to take a sharpshooter shot and add a point of grit for an aimed shot to  the legs actually does that make that harder for me to shoot him later  travis i have pretty big legs  taliesin no i mean if youre prone i can still shoot him just fine  laura not with sharpshooter i think if theyre prone we dont take disadvantage right  matt if theyre prone an attack roll against 
none	 the creature has advantage if theyre within five  feet otherwise its disadvantage if the person is prone its harder  for you to hit with ranged weapons  taliesin in that case im going to hold on that grit and im instead going to use a piercing shot  with sharpshooter so for shot number one with animus sharpshooter oh for fucks sake  travis is that a misfire  taliesin its another misfire  matt this is not very percy of you  taliesin no so that needs to be picked up thats fine irritated i pull out 
none	 bad news and  take another shot  matt okay is this also piercing  taliesin this is also piercing  matt so thats another grit spent  taliesin another grit spent oh thank you god damn it thats better 22  matt 22 grog  travis oh yeah that hits sorry  matt so you get to also roll an attack against vex as well  taliesin yes  matt basically the shot goes through both of you it goes through grogs shoulder explosion  and has enough weight to actually impact and hit vex in the same shot 
none	  taliesin thankfully it cant misfire when i do this 16  laura no  matt so you watch as the muscle of the shoulder explodes and in that brief second you dodge your  head out of the way and watch as the ball goes whoosh and skims the edge of your cheek a  little blood goes flick down the side  laura i glare at percy from under grogs armpit  matt you glare at him through the hole in his shoulder tombstonestyle  travis grog doesnt understand why youre so mad at his shoulder  taliesin 
none	 aw shit so thats counting thats 33 points of piercing damage  matt 33 points of piercing damage thats 16  taliesin plus four necrotic damage  matt four necrotic not halved  taliesin and im going to take my last shot actually im going to take a retort shot because  this is the fucking day im having and im going to burn another grit and im going to try and  knock him prone because youre welcome  travis you just have a thing for me today  taliesin that too this is another sharpshooter with retort ugh 
none	 thats a 16  marisha snitch is failing you tonight  taliesin 16 to hit  travis misses  taliesin goddamn it  matt this time you turn around and see percy there he pulls out the retort shot and youre  like whoosh and duck right out of the way  taliesin im diving back behind the bloody doorway goddamn it  matt okay thats about the extent of your movement there  taliesin yep that did not go well  matt all righty that ends your turn  taliesin yep oh you have a disadvantage on wisdom saving 
none	 throws right now wisdom checks  travis because of hex wisdom saves  matt not saving throws checks so insight perception things like that  travis most things that i normally suck balls at anyway  taliesin i want to make sure you really suck at them right now  matt all right the pillars that you see in the center here begin to vibration emit that weird  vibrating hum again and you feel keyleth as the gravitational pull warps around you but doesnt  affect your form because of your freedom of movement  taliesin like the matrix 
none	  matt however trinket seems to groans be pulled down by the gravity of it you watch as dotys  form on the ground across the way crack gravity crushes a little further in towards the stone  travis is it anything inside of the four pillars or in circles around each pillar  matt it seems to be radial around each pillar all right vex youre up  taliesin i take two psychic damage on top of that i forgot about that  laura im going to put myself out  matt okay so you put yourself out as

none	 can lay underneath the  surface of the acid  matt you delve into the pool with a splash as it spills over the edges and you submerge yourself  beneath the surface its just deep enough for you to get entirely within the water  laura but all the acid pours up and out doesnt it displacement  matt it displaces a bit yeah but while shes in it shes currently submerged  travis shes not hurt from it  laura does trinket get hit by the acid but doty does too  matt yep both of them begin 
none	 to just sizzle dotys done  laura right but just in case  sam oh i thought he was immune but hes not  matt nope and trinket begins to slowly dissolve in his unconscious state that is a second failed  death save on trinket  sam dotys done  matt well yeah  laura keyleth doesnt care about animals apparently  marisha nope  laura only plants  marisha thats true a little biased  travis at least finish him with dignity before you go into the pool you just passed right by  him just let him 
none	 suffer unconscious  marisha i mean i could accidentally trip over him and kick him into the pool with me if you  really want me to  matt is that your turn keyleth  marisha thats it  matt all right taryon  sam land in the smoke  matt all right  sam see that doty is history  matt yes  sam fire prismatic spray at the dragon  matt okay  marisha you cant see me  matt youre submerged in the water but the spray goes through water its a light effect so you  
none	 grab one of your rubies you run up to the edge of the smoke and release a prismatic spray in this  direction trinkets done trinket is turned to dust and ash were talking terminator 2 dream  sequence atomic bomb  travis its all t2 tonight  marisha question sorry before we move too far are people affected by my frightful presence  within 120 feet those who are aware of me once i heavy footsteps and then go in  matt thats an interesting point actually  marisha 120 feet wisdom saving throw  matt well the only

none	  screams and watch her dive into the acid pool and you go screams  sam so when im frightened i just want to get away right  matt well no when youre frightened specifically you have disadvantage on ability  checks and attack rolls as long as you can see them and you cannot move willingly closer to it  you can move away or adjacent but you cannot move closer to her you make the saving throw at the  end of your turn  sam i was not planning on it anyway  taliesin but it does 
none	 mean that you have disadvantage on the attack  sam but its a spell  matt its a spell it doesnt affect him at all so you still have to make a saving throw versus  prismatic spray  marisha shit what kind of a saving throw  matt well find out here in a second  taliesin it could be anything it could be something youre downright immune to  marisha thats true come on acid  matt so i need you to roll a d8 please  sam d8 four  matt four i need you to make

none	 of the side of the mouth and you see  a giant grog  taliesin on fire  matt on fire with the hammer pulling back grog you look over your shoulder and you see a big  black dragon whoosh  marisha i look at him and i say in draconic because i always forget i go grog check it out  grog look  matt the dragon goes guttural growling speech  marisha im going to be like sorry but ive always wanted to do this vomit noises and do an  acid breath 60foot line fivefoot wide 
none	  sam youre trashed  travis fire elemental back to keyleth into a dragon  laura come on  matt to be fair you guys focused on each other for most of this fight  travis thats true  matt i need you to make a dexterity saving throw grog  travis thank you thank you sir may i have another 17  matt that does not succeed keyleth i need you to roll your 12d8 acid damage  that grogs about to take  laura oh are you immune to acid damage  travis no  matt nor resistant

none	 plus  taliesin 70  marisha 70 total acid damage  matt guttural growling theres a stream of acid that sprays down the tower over you grog go  ahead and make your constitution saving throw  sam tary versus a dragon this is dragon slayer  travis 21  matt so as the acid sprays over grog grog still stands there covered in acid and looks at you it  puts out the fire  marisha do you have one hit point left or some shit  matt barbarians have an ability where when they go to zero hit 
none	 points they make a constitution  saving throw to resist going to zero  laura what is he at then  travis one  laura oh okay  matt but hes still standing as the acid is sizzling  travis but the fires out  marisha the fires out which is ironic because that means at the top of your turn you could have  theoretically died with the remainder of my movement  matt your hunters mark is gone now you have your movement  marisha i still have more movement can i go oh fuck in draconic and 
none	 go boop right back  underneath the acid  laura she basically pooped thats what it sounded like she did  matt okay  travis how much movement do you have  marisha i have an 80 fly speed  matt into the water youre mostly submerged right now splashing in and out of the water its  displacing a lot of the acid your wings and your back are still visible  all right that end your turn  marisha he doesnt have anything fighting against threequarters cover  matt with that taryon  sam yeah ill be fine 
none	  matt you watch this dragon fly up spray acid onto the tower  and then disappear into the water below  sam out of curiosity where and in what condition is percivals dead body  matt you havent seen him  sam great not even when i was in the sky  matt when you were in the sky you saw what looked like a mess in really nice clothing so you  saw percival the head was pumpkined it was bad  sam okay then  travis are you checking on the state of percys brain  sam 
none	 i might need to use it can i poke out this corner  taliesin is that getting closer to the dragon  sam is it  matt actually heres the thing real fast let me read this frightful presence you repeat at the  end of its turn make another roll for the end of your last turn i forgot to make you do  sam thats a two again  matt so in theory you know the dragons there you cant quite move closer to it and that would  be considered closer so youd have to go around 
none	 this way  sam wheres the door to the thing its right there on the front right the door to the tower  matt the door to the tower is right there yeah  sam thats away from the dragon  matt it is yeah  sam ill use my movement to go there  marisha are you still invisible  sam nope  matt you get there you see the dragon as you rush by the smoke is still there  sam i poke around the side of the smoke  marisha im like a florida alligator right now 
none	  matt you move past the smoke and the pillar  sam and a quick little prismatic spray  matt this flaming sphere is gone by the way forgot that all right so roll a d8  taliesin thats a d6  sam oh shit four again its the same  marisha fuck  matt all right so go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw keyleth  marisha nope i think thats the exact same thing i rolled last time  matt so thats another 10d6 poison damage  sam should we call it the same  matt and 
none	 taliesin no  sam i dont like to roll this many things  travis youre actually very fast  taliesin two four six eight nine and you have one there you go  sam 35  matt 35 points of fire damage to you  taliesin 35 points of poison  matt poison damage yeah  taliesin im enjoying being the rules nazi here  matt keyleth make a constitution saving throw  marisha dont fuck me gil dont fuck me thats good thats even better 24  matt yeah youre fine you maintain your concentration okay and  sam 
none	 going into the tower i have a bunch of movement left right  matt you do yeah  sam ill go into the tower  matt you have your boots and the potion so your movement is 160  sam 120  matt 120 yeah you can go anywhere in that tower if you wanted to theres this floor theres the  second floor theres a third floor and then theres the hatch through the top  sam ooh theres floors  matt yeah  sam im going to go into the second floor that has those little  travis 
none	 yeah the little slit windows  sam yeah is there any that can see the dragon or no  matt this is a stairway which blocks this technically thats just there so you can fit up  into here and you dont technically see the dragon from that you can glance over to the side  of here and poke your head through the stairs and look and be like whimpers  sam ill look get a bead and then just duck back so no one knows where i am  and also sanctuary  matt and also sanctuary one 
none	 more sanctuarys not there since you used prismatic spray  laura i know right  marisha just hide  laura i mean come on that wouldve been the absolute best thing to do  taliesin just hide and be extremely inconvenient to matt  travis it is a strategy  marisha yeah youre called a dirty camper a camper like someone  who camps in firstperson shooters  sam thats me thats exactly me  matt all righty so make a wisdom saving throw to see if you can resist the frightened effect  sam 15  matt plus  
none	 sam minus one  matt minus one nope youre still frightened youre still like oh god dragon  laura damn i wish my thing wasnt busted i would put him in the  travis i know  matt all righty top of the round the pillars once again vibration and begin to affect this  area around these pillars beginning to call gravity to the ground all righty that brings us  to vex roll a death saving throw  laura save  matt yeah okay grog your turn  travis standing there with one hit point acid melting my

none	  the power of energy the darrington name strikes him down  matt the cold shatters you and you feel the ribcage break like brittle glass on the inside of  your chest from the blast backward you fall to your knees unable to move a muscle you can feel  the life barely beating through your body is heaving with each heartbeat pulse hes prostrate  before you taryon as you approach  sam i say doty take this down i win and i kick him over  matt as you hit the ground as the last of the 
dung	 cold damage has curled over your body and freezes  you solid you shattering shatter into thousands of small frozen pieces the last t2 reference of  the night yep as taryon darrington stands victor of this round as you stand there breathing  heavily suddenly the stone top of the tower cracks open like its being pulled apart by giant  invisible hands and there you see descending from above a gentleman in a large dark cloak and  a magnificent beard and a glorious wellkept mane of hair he lands let this blessing of  colville carry you 
none	 into any dimension he touches your forehead and you feel the fates reach into  you and plant you with a seed of possibility and then with that a flash is gone you awaken in  your bed cold sweat the next morning after you went to sleep youre not as powerful as you felt  before that was a crazy dream but you look down and you see this slight glow of white light across  your sternum from underneath your silk pajamas and then it fades and you feel like something  from that dream is holding on 
none	 and thats where were going to end our game tonight  cheering  travis you got your fate dice  laura oh my god and your parents are named after tony starks parents how crazy is that  sam oh wait they are  travis how many hit points did you have left  sam i still had 30 or something  taliesin he had 25  matt im curious where were you going to try and plane shift grog  marisha water plane water dimension you would have just drowned  taliesin solid  marisha i didnt know your

none	 it feel like little bunker areas  laura you did have places that people that were flying could hide  matt yeah  travis if we had tried to hit one of the spires that created electricity  would that have ended that  matt here you could have destroyed it hitting it would have done damage to it but it would have  prevented that from going off in that area  sam were all the trunks the same thing  matt yeah each trunk had one healing potion it was whoever got there first  taliesin and there 
none	 was one trunk left  matt one trunk left that nobody went to  travis which one  marisha the one that i was in for a lot of the time  taliesin i kept thinking about telling you  travis oh really the one down here in the lower left  taliesin yeah bottom left  marisha it was the one i was camping out in  taliesin but it wasnt my turn so i didnt say anything  marisha i almost thought about taking it just so no one else could have it but never got to it 
none	  matt well done guys  taliesin giggles that was nuts  matt oh man well when this campaign arcs over and we have everybody available hopefully well  probably have one final battle royale with everyone max level with vax with pike and see  who comes through on that one and whatever gift boon i decide for that one if its similar or the  same will probably carry over to the next campaign for their first new characters  should be fun  marisha level 20 keyleth is nasty i get unlimited shapechange  travis what do

none	 fucking necklace  matt nobody tried  taliesin theres so many ways that you could have died tonight  marisha yeah you could have died 80 times  taliesin if that glove had worked i would have had an action surge and five shots to the head  matt its the balance to the necklace so you cant just imprison the main big bad guy of  something and be like oh thats over because he rolled poor it will help for a while but if he  stays in there for a long time and hes intelligent hell eventually 
none	 find a way out its  an imperfect prison  taliesin its a wicker basket  travis and the deck yet again didnt harm me  laura well you dont know that because it was all a dream in tarys fucking head  marisha you pulling that knight probably changed things because he did just enough damage to me to  make it a pain in the ass  taliesin that plus two to modifier theres a lot  sam the cards were amazing  matt im going to hold onto those if thats okay i want to use those
