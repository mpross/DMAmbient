none	 stolen letting he still messages  occasionally wheres my broom its pretty great anyway that being the case lets go ahead  and jump into tonights chaos for this episode of critical role  dramatic music  matt hello everyone so from last weeks episode vox machina our band of adventurers who  have found their way into a struggle against a group called the chroma conclave a collection of  ancient chromatic dragons that have torn across the landscape of taldorei and beyond setting  ruin to a number of major cityscapes and then claiming areas as their own 
none	 after the fact in  order to combat this eventually hopefully their leader thordak the cinder king a great and  powerful red dragon theyve been in search of ways to improve their prowess as heroes in search  of these artifacts known as the vestiges of divergence lost from wars long past after  finding information about these it was also discovered that one of their original homesteads  westruun the actual place where pike and grog for a large portion of his life grew up after  being sieged by the dragons had been overtaken by the herd 
town	 of the storm of which grog previously  ran with for most of his life and was helmed by kevdak his uncle a rather cruel and ruthless  leader after they had absorbed the river maw years beforehand that had swollen to a great size  battled the dragon and amongst their losses came to an accord in which they would leave riches for  the dragon and it would let them be for the time being upon making their way into the town  thinning some of the ranks of this ravenous herd travis as grog threatened kevdak to 
town	 a battle  oneonone for supremacy of the herd and quickly may have gotten in a little over his head in the  center of the town square a great battle commenced where after calling to his side his  friends vox machina a bloody fray that nearly felled a few of you through some ingenuity some  decent planning and some trickery of magical item use you managed to survive and have grog deal the  death blow to kevdak amongst all of the watching herd after some barely scraping by diplomacy  managed to bring it all to 
none	 a ceasefire for the time being freed kevdaks son your cousin  zanror who from his bindings seemed to be of a different mentality emotional mindset than his  father was and is now wishing to with the two of you being vox machina and the remainder of the  herd bring this fight to the black dragon itself pulling themselves from under the thumb of  its rule thus saving westruun and your own lives in the process you all have brought to life one  child who was lost in this fray and are currently escorting this boy 
none	 northward towards the temple  district of westruun and that was where we left off last time so as you guys recovered somewhat  some of your wounds taken a breather begin walking through the now slowly unrolling streets  of westruun some folks are coming out some are still staying in because there are still various  druids warriors of a very aggressive nature wandering the streets though sparser than before  seeing you guys walk through as many people do recognize you through your previous exploits  building a little sense of security they have not had for 
none	 the better part of a week making your way  northward with this little boy you eventually find your way into the outskirts of the temple  district the very familiar halftoppled stone wall that in a circular way encompasses this  portion of the northwestern side of westruun what would you like to do  ashley well i would like to make a proposition if everybody would like to take a rest i know im  pretty rough right now and maybe we could go see if my greatgreat grandfather is okay  laura of course  marisha we 
none	 were in the process of  sam escorting this boy to his home  marisha it was the three ladies right  laura but well bring him home then well find your grandfather  ashley yeah  laura or we can take him home and meet you  ashley who how where is  sam little dead boy  ashley yes  matt the little boy is still clutching on to trinkets fur riding him behind you hes got a  little smile on his face the dried blood still covering half of his smile  laura does any of 
none	 this look familiar to you darling  matt yeah mom should be up that way and he points further down the thoroughfare  ashley its close  laura yeah and your grandfather lives in this area as well  ashley yes  taliesin dont see why we cant do both  sam swing by his house yeah  matt giddyup and he kicks the side and trinket like grunts lumbers forward  laura i pat trinkets butt its okay  matt licks your hand begrudgingly and continues forward plodding on the cobblestone for a while  eventually the boy looking 
town	 for familiar sights some of the buildings have taken some damage in  the initial black dragon onslaught he does suddenly point his finger forward and goes  thats it thats it and you go past a couple of humble buildings and then you start getting  into the slum section i say slum its where the poor people in the temple district live when  theyre not tending to temples or businesses that are surrounded by this district you can see its  a functional its a standing hovel but its mainly a scrap wood roof bits of thatch 
none	 to help  maintain any protection against rainfall the wood looks old some of it may have been rotted but  treated since its functional but the boy jumps off trinket  laura oh be careful  matt doesnt even pay attention to you runs up to the door and hits the door and its solid he  goes and pulls on it and it seems to be closed so he goes mommy mommy he seems genuinely  excited but also trying to get in the front door  laura i walk up behind  marisha i whisper to pike 
dung	 and be like mm we didnt think about this potential outcome did we  laura hello is anyone home its relatively safeer than it was  matt time passes what are you doing  ashley can i check the door if its locked  matt the door itself doesnt have a knob per se it has a small dark iron handle thats bolted to  it but you pull it and somethings holding it back like theres something actually barring it  from the other side  ashley thats a good thing  matt a few moments pass silence  
none	 marisha child how long has it been since youve been away from your home  matt they just pulled me out today then you hear a voice come from the other side of the  wooden door peeking through the space hello  laura knockknock we have your son safe and sound  marisha delivery  laura special delivery for childs mum  matt theodore and the boy goes yes mom please please please theres nice people out here  and you hear the shifting of wood onto the side the door opens ever so slightly and on the  
none	 inside you can see a pale and scaredlooking woman clean simple clothing has some sort of  halftorn apron on thats wrapped around a simple peasant blouse she has her hair up in this small  cloth cap and she pushes through theodore opens the door and picks him up and wraps him in  her arms and holds him for a second not even paying attention to any of you and theres this  moment where you can see the fear that has been stuck in her mind since he was pulled from the  inside of their abode 
none	 slowly abated with the return eventually she stops and her eyes come up  over his shoulder to the rest of you im sorry pardon my manners im yulia thank you  laura of course well  matt puts theodore down hold on let me she goes and steps inside of her home eventually a  few moments later she comes back and she has a small handful of coins  laura no darling put that away  matt i its the least i can do  travis is that it  laura truly put that away  marisha its 
none	 not what we did this for its fine were just glad hes home safe  laura and not even slightly dead  marisha nope not a scratch  ashley hes fine just nothing even happened  marisha if he has weird dreams dont worry about it children you know  matt her eyes are partially trained on grog as she now notices you she steps further out of the  house shes like is everything okay now  laura oh yeah he killed the bad guy  travis were under new management now going to be a lot of changes 
none	 around here for the better  matt okay thank you she cups the coins back into her hand reaches down and rubs theodores  hair looks at the blood thats still there and looks a little worried for a second  laura i think its paint i think it might be paint they were painting  matt is he going to be all right  marisha oh yeah hes great  sam we had spaghetti for lunch  laura quite an adventure  matt thank you  marisha give him a little hot cocoa warm blanket hell be fine  
none	 matt better go clean you up go clean you up and hes like okay and he runs in behind her  as she turns again and takes the door and pauses for a moment looking out at you and says once  again very quietly under her breath thank you  laura have you sorry have you seen a small elderly an older gnome  matt wilhand  laura yes have you seen him is he all right  matt weve been staying inside since the incursion came  laura all right  matt the few that i have seen 
none	 were not under good circumstances but the fact that i havent  seen him might be a good thing  laura yes  sam do you know if they were hiding anywhere if anyone else went anywhere specifically to hide  matt not a lot of places to hide only certain areas in the sewers are safe and our homes are  the best places if we knew our way around our own homes we had a hiding spot but theodore got away  from us hearing all the noise and they managed to take him away  travis where 
none	 did you hide  matt she brings you guys inside and its very very plain in the interior its very cold you  can see there is a small firepit with a cauldron over it thats used for making simple soups and  whatever food they prepare in here there is a portion of the roof that is open to allow any sort  of smoke to pass through but it does have some runoff to let any sort of water fall off outside  the window she heads back behind where the cold cauldron is and where the stones 
none	 are set up to  guard the back from catching any of the wood behind it she goes and pulls on one of the pieces  of stone and as she pulls it back its a false front of stone that pulls open theres a small  cabinet there that you see there used to be a religion check for those who are trained in it  or who are skilled in it  laura trained in it  ashley you can try  matt have a proficiency  ashley 20  matt okay you see even a quick glance 
none	 theres a small broken statue that lies to the ground and  you can see the semblance of a destroyed shrine this back room was a shrine to melora and has  since been seemingly tossed aside in the hurried state of trying to protect ones family  marisha can i reach down and pick up the statue  matt its in three pieces as you pick it up she goes oh im so sorry we she goes for your  hand and goes i didnt hopefully shell forgive us i know she will  marisha tell me about this 
none	 deity  matt melora  marisha melora  matt and youve heard melora its a whole section of vasselheim that is based around her  sphere of influence and she is actually where most of the food in vasselheim is grown in such a  cold environment her blessing is what allows the land there to be fertile for crops from many  different places  travis sweet  matt but she tells you and you can see the symbols too the symbols that are carved in the  side of the stone are these swirls almost like a slow 
none	 cascading spiral she says melora watches  over nature she watches to make sure we have a good harvest she makes sure we dont get washed  away in the storms she makes sure that the ships to the far west make their passage across the  ocean she looks out for us smaller folk and brings vengeance upon those who attempt to destroy  our life as she looks distantly out the open door behind you into the city itself but anyway  ill repair that  marisha i might be able to help can i attempt hang on 
dung	 can i attempt a mending spell on it  matt yes you can you take a moment close your hands around it close your eyes and you can see  what little bit of dried grass or moss thats gathered at the edges of the stone all of a sudden  spreads and encompasses all the pieces of stone as youre holding it together she takes a step back  her eyes full of wonder as the moss then turns dark brown like a shell of soft vegetation and  then cracks and falls away leaving behind the stone statue 
none	 in one piece  laura thats sick  travis sweet  marisha i hand it over and i tell her im a druid of the ashari people and i know several  worshippers of melora but wasnt necessarily a believer of her powers  matt she protects you too  marisha and youre sure of this  matt she looks over to her child whos now sitting on the side pulled a couple of these  wooden toys out from the side and is gathering them in his arms and is grabbing all the things  that he missed while 
none	 he was taken away and she says she brought you to me she brought you to him  marisha why should i believe  matt shell show you in her own way  marisha thank you my lady  matt she takes the statue and well if theres anything else i can do for you  travis yes actually you should leave i dont mean that in the way that it sounded sorry back  up so come tomorrow there might be danger in westruun you and your kin should go in fact  anyone that you see take them 
none	 with you theres a little encampment not far from here  sam there is  travis yeah all the shanty area of people  sam oh oh the refugees  matt they were south of here by foromir basin  sam south north northwest south  travis its over by foromir basin head for that if you can  sam look for no trees  matt she takes a mental note no trees all right i havent been that far south should we  get the others should we tell others to come with us if there is danger here 
town	  sam were going to fight here i thought we were going to do this out of town  travis theres a fight coming here you dont want to be here dont be too obvious about it on  the sly if you can but try and make your way out of here before dawn tomorrow  matt okay we will theodore start gathering your things were taking a little trip  laura a fun trip  matt he goes a trip yay and starts gathering more of his things he gets a pillow case and  starts putting stuff 
none	 into it we havent done a trip we havent done a trip  i know thank you  travis on second thought should we ask them to leave on the sly like through the sewers just  in case  marisha i wouldnt make a show of it  travis so maybe underground if they can  marisha yeah  taliesin i think were going to have are we here i cant remember  matt yeah youre all together  marisha i thought we werent either i thought it was just the girls but then everyone started talking  liam 
town	 and then grog was here reality is very malleable  taliesin i think were going to have to have a larger conversation about where everybody ends up  in the very near future and while two people in and out of town is definitely agreeable i think  theres a larger discussion to be had  liam i have an odd question for you  matt yes  liam do you know of anyone still in the city who would know their way about the sewers  matt i mean usually the guards would go through and make sure that 
town	 the things that were  living down there werent living anymore but i dont know anyone in particular that worked down  there sorry  liam its fine  sam i know someone  taliesin you do  sam yeah  marisha why dont we let this woman return to the rest of her day  taliesin we have more appointments as well much to do today  laura whispering one last question this is it i swear  matt okay  laura are you familiar with anyone in the farming area just outside of town  matt ive seen 
none	 some folks come and go  laura were looking for a woman who was a daughter of one of the gentlemen that worked in  the fields and we really have no idea how to go about finding her  travis whispering reginald  laura reginalds daughter yes  matt reginalds daughter ill ask  laura all right you know where to find us well be about  matt all right  taliesin i think i know who to have that discussion with as well  sam good day oh  ashley i go over to theodore and i dont 
none	 think i have to bend down  matt no no hes maybe half an inch shorter than you  ashley i had a little wooden doll and so im going to pass it to him and say in case we never  see you again you can always think of us when you play with this thats for you and you can name  him whatever you want  matt whats your name  ashley pike  matt i will name you pike throws it in the pillowcase says thank you gives you a quick  little kiss on the 
none	 forehead  matt pulling more things in the pillowcase  ashley theodore  liam so much better alive than dead  laura i know i mean good thing he never died  liam hey a rare ray of sunshine from the dm today  sam lets continue on  travis dont poke him  matt you guys say your goodbyes she lets you go and she locks the door behind and you gather  theyre making their necessary preparations where to next  taliesin pike  sam to wilhands  ashley follow me please  matt all right not too 
none	 far away actually you come to the red brick homestead where pike grog  and wilhand live mostly intact the second floor which you guys are definitely familiar with  liam hey i remember this place wow  matt part of it has fallen in doesnt look like its been set fire or any serious damage in  that regard some sort of nearby rubble or some sort of impact caused part of the roof to collapse  from the outside you come up to the front door its currently locked  ashley thats a good sign i think thats 
none	 a good sign  travis do you want to knock  ashley yeah  matt no answer  laura you have a secret knock you maybe used  travis maybe you should say whos knocking just in case you do knock so strong  ashley poppop wilhand its pike  taliesin well i heard that  matt nothing  laura he might have very soft footfalls  taliesin he might not be home  marisha is he old and hard of hearing  ashley a little he could a little vax would you mind maybe youll get some luck with 
none	 this door  matt technically pike you do have the keys to the home  liam i mean i can do it if you want to  ashley wait hold on i forgot that somewhere in this armor  taliesin no he needs this he needs this its all right absolutely needs this  sam ill explode the door  ashley all that clanking is actually this key moving about my armor all right  matt unlocks the door  liam that key has seen a lot of miles  marisha been around the world  matt you push and 
none	 the door hits something  sam damn it doors  matt it like budges maybe a quarterinch  laura hes barricaded the door thats a good thing thats a really good thing  ashley i go to the crack poppop wilhand its pike  laura i go and look through the window is there a window  matt there is a window there is cloth shuttered around it you cannot see in the inside  liam and the hole in the roof could i get up it  matt you could probably get up there if you wanted go ahead 
none	 and make a make an athletics check  liam all right  taliesin bugger all i say we give it a shove  liam eh 14  matt it takes you a few minutes but you eventually climb your way up looking down into  the second floor part of the roof is fully pushed in it looks like theres a piece of wayward stone  that was ejected from an impact not too far from here possibly from one of the nearby temples  that ended up slamming through the roof its partially embedded in the ground the woods 
none	  splintered up around it but it didnt hit the bottom floor it lodged itself in the floor of the second  liam hear anything see anything inside  laura what do you see oh well  matt are you at the bottom floor bottom floor all there is some furniture thats busted but a  lot of the furnitures all been pushed right to the front door theres a giant barricade of  mishmashed furniture that is jammed impossibly into this front area  ashley hes very strong  taliesin were going to give a push to the front 
none	 door  matt more amusing when you consider that theres a glass window right next to it that is not  blocked at all shuttered so carefully  liam theres a window theres nothing in front of it you want to come in the window  taliesin we give a shove  marisha we give a big shove  matt make a strength check with advantage well say as you well him having advantage youre helping  marisha oh him having advantage because im helping  taliesin oh 18 is my strength  matt 18 you guys have to slam 
none	 it a few times and the impact lodges a few things loose come  cascading down causing a bit of a racket but eventually you manage to get it pushed open enough  where you guys can squeeze through  liam you just broke a chaise lounge but come in  laura pike after you  ashley okay i step in and start looking around  matt looking across the way you see the fireplace mantle has been ruined where the  original small shrine to sarenrae used to be looks like its been knocked over and then put  
none	 back together on top haphazardly like it was shattered and then was put up there and is  delicately keeping its form by how it was laid the rest of the room is cold its quiet other  than your footfalls  ashley can i check the bedroom  matt okay you go up to the bedroom area as you go up the stairs you can see the giant piece of  stone thats smashed in there where the bed would be in part of the bedroom area  laura pike did he have any hiding places like that other 
none	 house  travis i go with her  taliesin im going to look around for personal effects papers  matt make an investigation check both of you guys  liam is there a basement here pike  laura 18  taliesin 15  matt what were you going to say  ashley there are hiding places  matt you guys go through the kitchen area and as you are looking about moving stuff in the pantry  area there is a small wooden slat that is partially moved across that leaves a small opening  in the floorboards  laura 
none	 percy wilhand  taliesin hello  matt shh im not here  taliesin pike ive got good news he says hes not here  ashley okay i go running down  matt okay you run and you push stuff out of the way theres the one board thats slid open all  the rest of the boards are still loose and placed over it do you just take the boards and toss em up  ashley i just pull them off  matt as you pull the boards off what little bit of light has made its way from the 
none	 window on the  far end of the kitchen you can see a bit of glimmer off a set of glasses that immediately  recoil in the shadow and go oh  ashley poppop wilhand  matt pike oh my goodness and his hand reaches out and grabs yours and you pull him up and hes  covered in dust and dirt and hes probably been down there the smell probably been down there  for a few days  ashley i give him a big hug  matt you give him a big hug he has long ratty silver 
none	 hair thats bald on the top bowled on the  sides curled up and matted on the edges of his shoulders his normally nice light blue sky blue  shirt is torn in places and covered in dirt he has been living under the house for quite a while  theres a little bit of dried food crusted on the side of his chin but hes there with a big ol  hug pike i missed you so much  ashley i missed you so much im so glad youre okay  matt look at you look at you whered

none	  travis but what is known is that theres going to be a fight tomorrow  taliesin theres probably going to be a fight tomorrow  travis and unless you want to throw down and i know youre a mighty warrior not saying you  shouldnt but if you dont want to now might be the time to hopskip out of here  taliesin theres no shame in prudence  travis no no not in the hole  matt he swats your hand away and goes heh goes back down into the hole you can hear him  rummaging a 
dung	 little bit something falls and shatters incoherent grumbling eventually he  comes back out clutching a dark brown glass bottle with a cork in it and he goes im going to need  some of this ugh  travis well dont be stingy  matt this is the trickfoot special been distilling while you were away  liam how much you got of that old man  matt ah about two casks  ashley all right i drink the whole rest of the bottle  matt it is awful it is like potato moonshine in its most basic form it

none	 sam is the kitchen even functional here  liam is there food  laura you know what we should do  marisha eat food and talk about a plan  laura bring him into the mansion  taliesin we could bring him into the mansion  sam we do need time to rest and plan  taliesin we still have one more stop before the evenings done  laura you can show his people that work at the mansion how to cook cause they are terrible i  can tell you that much  sam theyre great at one dish 
tavern	  matt you have a mansion  sam i do im quite successful as gnomes go in fact before we  matt pike he has a mansion  ashley he does he does have a mansion its a magic mansion  travis is wilhand drunk right now  matt he looks like hes coping with the past weeks events  travis insight check his soberness  laura hes been drunk the whole time  sam should we make the mansion get wilhand a room and then go to our last destination of this  night before we turn in  
none	 travis yeah we could do that  liam yeah grog how long do you reckon we have before your cousin wants to either talk or get busy  travis i dont know  sam are we supposed to meet up with him later tonight  travis he said at dawn we wait at dawn we fight or at dawn we plan  marisha i dont think ive ever heard anyone say at dawn we plan so im going to assume  ashley at dawn we plan  sam at dawn we rise and make a plan  taliesin at dawn 
none	 we quorum  marisha at dawn we microsoft excel  matt you get the sense he meant at dawn to make an aggressive action  taliesin so we have two stops before the evenings done then  laura wait where are we going  sam theres a house were supposed to plunder  taliesin theres a house were supposed to plunder and we should plunder it  travis aw really do we give a shit about it  taliesin yes we do  travis no youre right we do  laura oh right master quall  taliesin master quall and 
none	 i will admit im vaguely indifferent about whether or not he gets  his property back but i am very keen to find out what that property is and what else he left if he  left that  travis why dont we set up the mansion in wilhands house well go and run our errand and  well come back and hell have gotten the kitchen all up to spec  liam yeah seeing as we might be tangling with a black dragon tomorrow an old one i think maybe  that stuff off youre talking about  taliesin 
none	 god forbid  liam no i dont think its a good idea but if it should happen if we get i wanted to say  railroaded into it but i dont know what that is well probably need every bit of edge we can get  so i actually agree with you for the moment percival we should stop by this house  taliesin this is terrifying and this is proof that we should do it then  marisha can we get an early 12 angry men raise of hands on who if they want to fight the dragon  
none	 or not do we want to do this  taliesin who wants to fight the dragon tomorrow  sam yeah im down weve got 40 goliaths with us this is the best time to attack no im alone here  laura its true its true i mean it could be one of the best times to attack  taliesin i would like to do three more days of research and planning  travis so can we make the door wilhands starting to turn green  liam i mean its a big conversation that we should have  sam lets table 
none	 it  liam the wherewhenhow is pretty huge  travis wilhand just give me the bottle take it easy  taliesin i feel that thats not something we do spur of the moment  sam all right lets get this man to safety and then well finish up our errands for the day yes  laura is there anything you want to bring with you  matt uh he starts walking over to the shrine and he takes it off with his hand thats all i  need as the head rolls off  travis never saw anything  ashley 
none	 well fix it  matt its fine they took ol davin too  sam what who  matt davin was your neighbor  ashley davin was my neighbor  sam is he gone is he dead  marisha didnt we meet davin  matt you didnt meet davin no  matt they dragged a bunch to the iron stocks i could only hide your uncles a coward pike im  sorry i shouldve helped you get the sense now the alcohols kicked in and hes started to go  through his emotional process now  laura hes your uncle i 
tavern	 thought he was your grandfather  ashley hes my greatgrandfather  sam and uncle  liam hes drunk  matt very drunk  taliesin come on no more of that talk  liam grandfather let me carry that for you before you drop it ill keep it safe ill keep  it safe for you you dont want the head to fall off it  matt no its heads fine okay passes it over  liam i subtly pick up the head from the ground  ashley so we can put him in the mansion  sam all right yes 
none	 ill make the mansion  ashley all right i kiss him on his forehead and say its going to be okay go in there take a  nap and show them how to cook  matt i will you come back soon my dumpling and he squeezes your cheek a little bit  whispers he has a mansion  ashley whispers what  matt whispers a mansion  laura whispers and hes super interested in her  matt youre of marrying age young pike  travis holy shit  ashley well talk about it later  matt ill tell you 
none	 how it is  ashley what  matt mansion ill tell you how it is  ashley oh ive been there you can go stay  matt youve been to his mansion  ashley i have my own room you can go stay in my room  matt i dont know if i want to  ashley hey scanlan how will he know which room is my room  sam your room is the one covered in rose petals  matt show me the mansion  sam so i will cast the spell ill sit down and start humming singing 
none	 my house is a very very  very fine house with chickens everywhere it used to be so fair  matt as the shimmering doorway is conjured in the center of the room  sam i take him in i show him to his room  matt the door opens and he looks inside whoa turns around to you looking at you through the  doorway its big  ashley its very big  sam here come with me i take him upstairs take him to his room and before i bid him adieu i say  later tonight we 
none	 can discuss more but i would like to ask for your granddaughters hand in  marriage but ill need your permission first  matt i need you to roll a hell of a persuasion check on this one  liam roll for initiative sam  ashley roll for initiative  travis holy shit  sam well its a 20  marisha shut up  sam but thats low for me  taliesin no it is  matt he goes ill think about it id like to see more of your fine abode  sam i call for five servants and 
none	 i instruct them to take him wherever hed like to go and give him  whatever he needs  liam wilhand voice wine cellar  matt they begin taking him on a tour of the grand estate  sam dont be cheap with the chicken  all right so i scoot out back to rejoin our friends  matt okay  taliesin i assume at some point were taking a short rest by the way  matt you guys took a short rest the end of the last session  taliesin oh lordy thank you  matt so if you 
none	 wanted to use any hit dice to heal yourself at that time  ashley i would like to go check my room out and see how it is see if its okay any damage  matt your room is intact its a little dirty and some of the crumbled stone and roof part pushed  its way into the room across the floor but for the most part your room is intact wilhands room  which was the main room on the upper floor was the one that got destroyed by the fallen rubble  ashley right  matt all 
none	 right whats the plan  sam should we split the party and send a few people to pillage this house that we were  instructed to pillage  taliesin we can all do it lets do it together  marisha yes i feel like this would be a group outing  ashley i wanted to grab something under the bed im going to take it and im going to hide it  matt okay  sam but there was some talk of needing someone to take us through the sewers and i can go fetch  someone who knows the 
none	 sewers  liam i think we need to maybe have a talk about what were doing  taliesin talk before that happens  liam before finding your friend  marisha time is of the essence  liam youre talking about mr d i know yeah  sam well or someone with him yes  liam right its a good idea but i think we need to figure out what were doing first  sam sure what are we doing  liam i have no fucking clue  marisha what are we doing actually  taliesin first were robbing an old 
none	 man  travis can we walk and talk  laura yeah we walk and talk  sam wheres master qualls  laura its at the fountain crossroads  sam brick twostory house near the fountain  marisha before we walk and talk do we get the general idea that its safe to walk through the  city right now without being murdered considering we just put on the most epic avengersstyle display  matt right and some people are coming to the streets though moving quickly from destination to  destination word has gotten around and theres been a general 
none	 sense of release throughout the  city you do pass a few of the herd members some of which are gathering their supplies gathering  their arms some of them are dragging the bodies of friends that had died in previous frays or just  havent been tended to and all of them keep a very intense eye on you nothing aggressive but  not friendly either  taliesin i think we have to convince kevdak to abandon this plan to attack the dragon  liam hes dead hes not going to do it  taliesin oh no kevdak wrong 
none	 one im sorry you all look vaguely the same to me im sorry  laura percival  liam except for this one  taliesin no hes got the beard and the ability to kill me in my sleep  travis im a unique little snowflake i take no offense  taliesin i find you charming  travis thank you  taliesin but no we have to convince them not to do this tomorrow  travis really  laura well honestly isnt the dragon going to come pick up its loot in the next couple days  its happening tomorrow  
none	 taliesin i think that perhaps if its possible to convince them to at least wait one more cycle to  heal and prepare for the battle  travis i dont know if well be alive in the morning i dont know if its occurred to any of  you but i dont particularly feel safe im glad we got out of there  laura im glad we have a mansion to hide in  travis im glad we have a mansion im glad we have a vestige because of it but look i got  abandoned once think anythings changed 
none	 since then  laura theyre not good people they killed a lot of innocents  taliesin i genuinely dont understand the place you come from  travis no neither do i but i dont really understand much things  taliesin i feel much better about any decision to just leave then although we would have to do  something about the city and everyone whos in it  liam yeah theres a lot to think about there are a lot of people still here and i personally  dont think attacking that dragon in the next few days is a 
tavern	 wise decision but if we do leave what  do we do with these people theyre going to be run over by these people  laura its possible we can wait for all of the goliaths and other barbarians to attack the  dragon and when they all leave the city we bar them out take the city back  sam and hold it against a dragon  laura well the dragon could be content fighting them we take the time and get everyone else out  of the city  taliesin are they clever enough to attack the dragon 
none	 at the point at which the drop is made or  are they going to not make the drop and wait for the dragon to attack the city  travis look if it was the day before yesterday i would have said theyre all fools and theyre  going to do it the stupid way but i think i underestimated em a bit so yeah i think they  might be a bit clever  marisha we also have your cousin zanror now at the head which seems a little bit more clever  than kevdak ever was  travis 
none	 yeah  taliesin we also have to empty out the prisons if we get that chance of any of the citizens they may  be holding  marisha well look its not a bad call the dragons seem to be interested in the power that  they hold over the people theres no people no power  taliesin will your cousin understand that we have a bigger battle to fight  travis no  laura on the other hand  sam this is our battle were trying to kill these dragons  laura when are we going to have a 
town	 better opportunity to kill a fucking dragon than with 40  giant strapping  sam two vestiges an army of 40 barbarians  liam are we going to have this discussion right here in the street  taliesin well were walking while were having it  liam how are we going to deal with one of the largest dragons weve ever seen in the air what  are 40 goliaths going to do with something 500 feet above us spitting bile from above  marisha he has to land to get his treasure  sam were going to have to 
none	 make that plan at some point  taliesin if i had time if i had a few days  liam youve got a day and a half maximum  marisha if we had a little bit of time or if were really really smart we could theoretically  rig the most epic dragon trap ever  taliesin we could  liam do you think your cousin would hold for a couple more days could he see the sense of  planning that longer  laura we cant leave the people in this city under the rule of any more of 
none	 these monsters  taliesin which is why we should get them to flee  laura we have to get people out  marisha right because even if we somehow by some insane chance defeat the dragon cool weve  defeated the dragon and now the city is still under control by the herd  taliesin well the herd will leave i think  laura will they after they ransack everything again  liam well thats what grog pitched to them  travis heres my vote so i can have it said i would rather get everyone that doesnt want to 
town	 die  in this town out to that encampment if we take this meeting with zanror we will no longer be  able to walk away there could be a total chance that they all turn on us right then in the throne  room in the yard wherever we are we could leave now  laura how do we get everyone out  marisha you and zanror seemed to have a mutual respect  travis yeah because i just saved his life for a second i also beat his ass when he was little  and let me tell 
town	 you a thing about grudges they dont go away  marisha so you dont think he would hesitate in a second to turn on us  travis no hes a little man and little men have napoleon complexes hes this horrible elf from  the west  sam i do have a napoleon complex  taliesin ive seen it its huge  ashley but if everybody is out of the town and its empty then wont the dragon know  taliesin yes itll be furious  ashley and then wont he leave  laura and hell come find us  
none	 liam anything we do here anything we do to that dragon anything we do in the city is likely to be  known by the other wyrms  marisha sure  taliesin eventually yes  liam so if we kill that dragon what do the other dragons do in that moment and are we ready to  take on thordak right now  sam no we kill it and run  laura but we cant kill all of them at the same time its got to be a onebyone process  liam absolutely but are we going to try to 
none	 kill the black and then go on a hunt for all these  marisha there are going to be consequences to this no matter what  taliesin how big is the black dragon  matt from what you saw oh man  travis bigger than the blue bigger than the white  matt it was bigger than the blue about equal size to the white  laura the white one that we killed or the white one that we also saw  matt the one that you fought at the keep  laura yeah that one was real bad  
none	 travis where i rolled a 21 and it missed  matt yeah it was id say from height size of standing on its legs probably i dunno 30 to 40  feet tall  marisha weve never fought like a full realized dragon correct  matt youve fought them  liam weve run from them  travis yeah remember 21 missed i cant believe im saying this  laura yeah but all those guys they were i mean they had strong attacks  travis right but there might be some that can hit him when hes in the air but 
none	 not all of them  taliesin if i if i had time i could build a machine that might be able to trap him on the  ground for at least a little while  travis yeah if you had time why are we being in such a rush about this  sam because we know where the dragon is we have an army we have an opportunity this is it were  never going to have an army  taliesin i think i disagree with that i think well absolutely have opportunities to have an  army and i 
none	 think that if we call upon the herd later for something like this maybe we can get  them i dont know  ashley how much time are you thinking  taliesin as much time as it takes  marisha you cant build a machine like that in under what a few weeks  sam and what if the machine fails we need a plan that doesnt rely on technology im sorry  laura what if we put out the loot let him come down and get it and then we throw big ropes up  and over him or 
none	 something  marisha i feel like between pike and scanlan and i well look i feel like between pike scanlan  and i and percy with his mechanical genius we can figure something amongst the spells that we know  to make a viable trap  sam if we have 40 goliaths throw 40 chains attached to  travis theyre not all goliaths  sam fine 30 goliaths would throw 30 chains with 30 spikes on them at this dragon i bet a few would hit  ashley i could throw up a blade barrier on top of him  
none	 sam yes we are super powerful theyre strong were smart lets do this  liam if we kill it now were going to have to be if we kill it now all the others are going  to punish the people theyre sitting upon and were not ready to go dragon to dragon to dragon  like that  laura will they dragons are vain how do you know they wont just find that dragon weak and  think that hes not worthy of them  liam theyre going to know that something challenged his power and there are going 
none	 to be  consequences for it theyll make a display of their strength  marisha i have a feeling they were very upset when we killed the blue one  sam so what were never going to kill any of the dragons then because that will happen at some point  liam we will we will its  sam and they wont react then its this is our mission to kill these dragons  marisha once again theres going to be consequences no matter what we do  matt at this point you guys have as you hit the end 
dung	 of your sentence percy you all look up and  you all see the twostory building with a dark red brick contrasting against wilhands home its a  deepset heavy brick with dark wood siding to it and it looks like dark marble finishes certain  elements of the base of it it matches the description that was given to you by quall  laura does it look like its been ransacked at all  matt it looks like the door is partially ajar  marisha partially ajar  taliesin why dont we see how our favor holds lets take 
none	 a moment  sam all right if we find something cool we kill the dragon  marisha oh were leaving this up to a coin flip now  travis 20 or a one seems to work well for us  marisha yeah  taliesin im curious what the fates would say  marisha sighs i dont give a shit what the fates have to say  laura i do have a coin with a 20 and a one on it  matt all right so whats the plan  laura are we going silently quietly walking up to the front 
none	 door  taliesin vax if you would be so kind  laura its already partially ajar  ashley should we check it for traps first  taliesin check for traps  matt all right if you want to make an investigation check  liam investigation or is it perception is normally what ive done for traps isnt it  matt investigations for traps perception is to notice how to disarm it  liam all right 27  matt 27 you approach the front door doesnt appear to be trapped you open partly the door and  the interior fireplace is 
none	 still going and you see the crackle in the distance fine furniture  set up there is the body of a goliath facedown on the ground about five feet from the front door  head splattered across the ground  liam oh hes dead  matt you also look around the circumstances and you glance upward to where his head would be and  amongst all these stone tiles in the ceiling theres one thats set slightly lower than the  rest right above where that splatter occurred  all whispers traps  travis a warm fire and i run 
none	 no  laughter  liam grog voice its a little brave running around  taliesin well this is exactly what i was hoping for  liam i need a minute everybody everybody hang back just for a second  travis yeah do you want me to hang outside  liam yeah vexahlia could you come here  laura of course brother  liam yeah this is a death box this room is a death box and i have a keen eye but i wouldnt  mind another set  laura dyou want me to look around  liam id like 
none	 us both to look around  laura from out here  liam no i said come inside  laura i can actually walk in  liam yeah  laura all right i stand exactly in front of the door and dont take any more steps  liam come in aww youre my bestie all right im going to start looking around for traps  laura i look for traps visually  matt both of you guys make investigation checks as you slowly move forward at a slow pace  sam can i assist you guys  liam well you know 
none	 your music does calm and soothe me  sam not with music ill send an invisible guy in there to start pressing on the floor and walls  laura oh well give us just a moment yeah but thats a good idea 24  liam 24  matt okay the two of you guys scoot forward and you find there are four different pillars in the  ceiling that are arranged in a similar way they are triggered by a little bit of pressure and you  see theres a rug that oversets it you can see the slight variations 
none	 in the texture of the ground  where the actual trigger plates are you get the sensation that this house was going to be  ransacked and then the troop that came in one of them went crushing noise and they went nooope  and backed out of the house  laughter  matt you eventually find your way across this area marking quietly with an arrow or scraping  the carpet where each one of these places are but you make your way across the room to a staircase  that leads up staircase that leads down  liam 
none	 bullshit bullshit lotta bullshit all right guys i think its safe to come into the  first room so you said because i was being a jackass and saying bullshit what was the  description you just gave  laura theres stairs were at the bottom of the stairs  matt yeah theres the main living area that has the fireplace and then stairs that go up and  stairs that go down  laura are there doors in this main its like a foyer  matt its like a giant foyer area theres an area that passes behind the 
none	 stairs something that  would go into a kitchen area like a dining room kitchen  liam lets not split up lets do this together  taliesin hes rich and paranoid so if anything is of value itll be downstairs so i say we do  upstairs first  laura all right  matt does trinket wait outside or is trinket following you  laura ohh trinket dear come on come on dyou want to go in the locket you do if you dont  you can wait out here but its probably safer in the locket  matt disgruntled 
none	 bear noises lumbers forward gives you a look like  laura dont be sad about it if you dont want to im not going to make you  matt trinkets pulled into the amulet  laura ooh i love him so much  matt amulet which youve now been in  laura what was it like grog  travis i left a little something in there for him time doesnt pass right does time pass in  the locket  matt you dont know  travis well i farted right before i hopped out  laughter  liam like a 
none	 nintendo cartridge  ashley fart noise raaaah goosh  travis i might not live past this fart noise  laughter  matt got to leave your mark  laura can we check out the stairs and make sure nothings wrong with the stairs  matt yeah go ahead and make an investigation check  laura oh i did not see anything  liam im fine i got a 20  matt okay the stairs as you begin to inspect you reach out and take the railing and take the  first step and your foot passes through the stair  
none	 liam ooh thats not solid at all look put your foot through that  laura im going to stand here and watch you do it actually  liam im going to get down on my knees and stick my head through the stairs  laura oh what are you fucking kidding me right now  matt you go to try and stop him as he pushes his head through the step  laura youre a moron  liam i know  matt you pass through this illusory staircase and you look up and you can see the bottom half of 
none	  the staircase this area is a slide that descends into darkness you having your darkvision can see  that the slide descends into a nowcold furnace  laura dyou want to get your whole body in there  liam but can i see i pull my head up what can i see at the top of the stairs is there a landing  matt no you look up and if you from where the illusion is the illusory stairs stop at a ceiling  a stone ceiling that leads down you cant look past it looking up you can 
none	 see a landing and a  secondary floor  liam okay is there any stray furniture around  matt yeah theres precariously placed  liam are there any shitty pillows or anything  matt yeah theres like a couple throw pillows on the couch that are by the  laura what are shitty pillows  liam i totally ignore my sister which is what ive done half my entire life and i stick my head  down and i let it go and watch it go down the slide  laura was that fun was that fu  matt roaroffire 
none	 sound you guys watch as a jet of flame jettisons out from the staircase  laughter  matt singes the top of the roof area where theres a bunch of wood but the wood is not  burned or charred and the flames die down again  liam hey yknow it wasnt fun but it was educational shithead and i walk over and stop at  the edge of the stairs going down you said there were stairs going down  marisha who the fuck is this guy  taliesin i dont know i certainly like him  liam same 
none	 thing i want to see could you help me over here  laura im looking im checking out those stairs too  liam wisearse  laura i wouldnt have slid down the fucking slide i would assume that leads to death i dont  need to throw a pillow down the slide to know  liam you are very smart and wise you know we could be dead tomorrow do you want to keep  arguing with me like this  laura no 21  liam yeah i got higher than that 26  laura dick  laughter  taliesin 
none	 i could watch this all day  matt the staircase descends solid stairs partway down you do see a slight carving in the  stone a glyph of some kind that is faintly hidden with dust and dirt placed to fill the gap there  is some sort of a symbol eversofaintly hidden in the stone halfway down  laura can we read it do we understand it  liam dyou know the last time i saw something like that the carpet was fucked do you think  wilhand would have any idea  laura the carpet  liam yeah 
none	 the no the other carpet  laura maybe scanlan has an idea what it is scanlan  sam oi  laura you know this rune over here  sam this what i dont even see what youre talking about  laura this little glowy rune right here look closely  sam oh i wouldve totally missed that  laughter  sam i think that i have not seen anything like this before but have i  matt make an arcana check  sam 13  matt it appears to be magical in nature the symbols elude you their construct the 
none	 arcane  equation that is based around this you cant tell if its still functional or not but it is magical  in its construction  sam want to throw a pillow down there  liam what an interesting idea  laura i go get a pillow and i throw it at the rune  matt laughs okay  laura howd it work does that is that how youre supposed to do it  matt the pillow impact down the stairs  liam yeah you did it wrong see nothing happened  laughter  sam well go get the pillow 
none	 try again  marisha try a lumbar maybe a different result  laura so wait wait wait the last time you saw runes like this you lost the carpet how did you  lose the carpet  liam well so did we never talk about that yeah a bunch of us were riding it ah it was  the dwarf i swear it was the dwarf we were on the carpet and there were runes on the walls and  as soon as we got near the runes the carpet went raspberry noise and fell down  laura so it 
none	 might disenchant whatever we have on us  liam well it could do that it could also i dont know anything about magic but i assume it  could burn us  laura well how do we make it not burn us  liam well sighs i mean hey shorty youre our best bet here i dont know anything about  this shit  laura who can undo magical thingies  sam not me pikey pike  pike you got any undo magicky things  matt this would be a dispel magic spell for the record  ashley yeah i 
none	 have dispel magic  matt you have it prepared  ashley yeah  matt then yeah you could give it a shot  sam youre my girl  taliesin i could try my dispel magic ability  liam whats that one  taliesin its called a bullet ill shoot it until it doesnt work anymore  matt all righty so pike so as you step forward they point out this glyph on the wall  youre going to cast dispel magic on it i need you to go ahead and roll a d20 and add your  spellcasting ability modifier 
none	 which  laura whoa oh what is it what was it  liam its a 20 on the floor  laura if it was bad it doesnt count but if its good it does  matt that doesnt count roll it intentionally  liam good because its not that good  matt so your wisdom modifier is actually a five because she forgot to add her level 12 bonus we  discovered recently so its now a 20 plus five on the roll so go ahead and roll a d20 add five  ashley all right 18  matt 18 
none	 as you reach up and grab your symbol of sarenrae you focus for a second and there is a  flash like a flashbulb as it flashes the glyph glows for a second and then you hear what sounds  like a cracking sound and this glowing energy seems to shatter almost like glass made of  energy as the energy fades and falls out of the glyph it hits the ground and it dissipates into a  light mist that then vanishes  laura good job pike  ashley i think its dispelled  sam i think so  
none	 liam good job pike  ashley thanks vax  marisha were going up right up or down  taliesin there were stairs there was no up  liam you dont want to go up theres no up up is ouchie  laura i thought we could skip over that one step and then there was up  matt the stairs from underneath go all the way up to underneath the point you havent attempted to  go over if you wanted to its up to you  laura yeah yeah we can jump over that little gap  liam oh 
none	 i thought you said it went to the ceiling  matt i mean the stair illusion is the entire staircase but you havent you dont see whats  on the actual landing  marisha youve got the fancy broom  liam you got the fancy broom exactly  laura hmm all right i get on the broom and i float on up to that landing and i look and see if  theres any traps on the ground without setting foot on it  liam ive seen you take other people can i hang off the bottom of that thing 
none	 can you carry me up  laura i dont know youre pretty heavy you might fit  liam im lighter than you  laura gasps its nothing to brag about scrawny  liam look at my constitution its very low  laura minus two i am equally scrawny  laughter  taliesin were learning so much tonight god  laura dangle well onto the bottom you can hang off the bottom of it  marisha you guys were born at the same time youre both scrawny  sam if youre going to do this i insist that we visually see

none	 enchantment on the door and the keyhole area itself you cant  ascertain the nature of it but as you approach you can see that the metallic sheen shimmers  without the light changing there is something about it that is unnatural  liam shit  laura whispers hey pike do you think you can try dispelling magic again because theres some  shimmery sort of shit on this door and i dont trust it  ashley yeah its really pretty but lemme give it a try  marisha its iridescent  ashley lets leave it its so pretty

none	 help because i only got a ten  sam can i inspire her retroactively  matt nope  as you mark off your second thirdlevel spell releasing the dispel magic the shimmer  intensifies for a moment on the door and then returns to its natural state  laura shit  sam i think it worked  taliesin do we have anybody who has telekinesis telekinesis of any kind  marisha telekinesis no  sam wait i can have i can have someone  laura oh your invisible servant  sam i can have someone turn the key if thats

none	 is  sam hes right in front of you dont be rude to mort  matt nothing happens  sam oh mort take the key  matt the key lifts out of your hand  taliesin thats very unsettling  matt its now in the middle of the air  taliesin okay lets everyone back up  sam i have to wait six seconds all right  marisha i want to throw up a gust cantrip in front of us to help shield us if anything happens  matt a light breeze shimmers before you whatre you going to do 
none	  sam mort open the door with the key  matt the key drifts over finds turns enters the keyhole turns to the side the metal around  the keyhole begins to glow brighter and brighter and brighter for a second the outer rim of the  door itself begins to glow accordingly like the actual frame of the metal door begins to go from  this dull dull old iron look to this almost red to orange to whitehot vision and then fades to  darkness and the door creaking  sam wouldve burned us  laura hey maybe 
none	  liam not us not us  laura yeah  marisha is your unseen servant okay  sam ah hes fine yeah hes fine  laura i walk through the gust of wind and get my hair tousled  matt you go through your hair gets tousled you unintentionally shouldercheck mort  laura sorry mort  liam im going to see if i can see any traps inside the room  matt sure investigation check  liam yeah doesnt matter 20  matt stepping into the room you do see that this is a chamber familiar to you you actually 
none	 had a  room similar to this in your keep this is specifically an arcane sanctuary this is used  for the construction and the enchantment and the development of various arcane items similar to  youve seen the chamber before at gilmores although on smaller scale this has seen various  types of use theres an alchemical setup in one corner untouched  liam wait scanlan  sam oi  liam would you and your lightfooted friend like to join me in here  sam sure ill come  liam yeah  sam yes mort join me  matt 
none	 mort has joined you  sam okay  liam i dont want to touch anything in here i dont see any traps  taliesin i want to touch everything in here  marisha i do too  liam have at it and i back up  sam all right lets go pillage ill start looking around and looting  matt perception check  taliesin im going to gingerly start looking to see if anything is useful because i have  a lot of plans  matt okay  sam five  matt the architecture catches your attention  sam ahh 
none	 its beautiful  taliesin 14  matt okay and what did you say you were going to do  marisha i wanted to head towards the alchemical stuff to see if theres  matt setup okay theres various glass beakers  marisha supplies  matt i mean there are supplies you can see there are there is a small rack that has many  glass vials that contain ground materials liquids various metals theyre all labeled  what languages do you know  marisha primordial druidic sylvan elven  matt oh elven youre not able to read the actual label 
none	  taliesin celestial can i read any of it  matt what other languages do you know  taliesin common celestial elven  matt also cant read it  taliesin would i recognize any of the alchemical symbols  matt from what you can tell theres symbols for you know mercurial liquid metals there are many  different herbal elements that are in here there are a few that the design on the label shows  toxicity you see there are iron filings all these things that are used in various you have  the brew potion ability correct  
none	 marisha yeah  matt so you also recognize some of these are used in the process of preparing liquids with an  easytoaccept presentation when youre enchanting and brewing a potion  marisha i start clearing out the materials and throw them in my bag  matt okay  laura can i look around for a fucking circlet  matt go for it  marisha what were you saying scanlan  sam dont you have some ability that you can find magical objects  laura 16  matt 16 you look around the room you dont see a circlet but 
none	 what you do notice in the far end  of the room is a 12foottall humanoid structure built of solid stone that stands there looming  across the way giant pistonlike stone arms tree trunklike legs youve encountered something like  this before  laura yes that looks very similar  liam with grogs dead dad  matt well no this was in the druid barrows  laura a golem that was up in the wall how about we tie its legs up just like we did before just  in case he comes alive then he can trip and 
none	 fall  marisha well im assuming its there in case someone breaks in like would trigger a trap  laura i dont care i start tying a rope around his legs  liam yeah dont we have that neverending rope lets do it like 200 times around  matt all right as you approach the giant stone entity pulling the rope out you can see  embedded in the chest theres a little slit a very very tiny slit in its stone chest you see a  faint blue sparking glow the very same color of the cortex that you 
none	 had recovered from the druid  barrows when you were originally hired by drez vina to recover it as you see this and you  approach it doesnt seem to react  marisha right wait and drez sent us out through quall  laura yeah  matt the masters who hired you  laura yeah yeah yeah so we fought this other thing because of quall  marisha so why are these things showing up wherever we go for quall  laura well because thats what he does  matt well the first one you encountered was built for the 
none	 barrow from whoever was in charge  laura he wanted the orb to bring this thing to life  marisha oh thats right and now he made now we see the fruits of our labor i see  sam we made this thing  marisha we brought back the crystal so he could make this thing  sam wow  taliesin i have no idea what youre talking about  laura if i take a step forward does he look like it has any kind of reaction  matt you take a step forward no reaction  laura im going 
none	 to keep trying to tie around his legs  liam ill help her out and well go back and back and all around  matt okay you guys bring the rope around and you tie it pretty taut around the legs which are  pretty close together theyre not like in a wide aggressive stance its standing there inert you  wrap the rope around it multiple times give it the best knots that you have  laura all right well i feel safer  liam i grab in my bag i have the charcoal that i once painted half 
none	 a beard on grog with and i  use it to draw a little curly mustache on it  laura really  matt okay so as you climb to the top and you get up there and smear this big ol pringles canstyle  mustache out of charcoal on the front of this stone golems featureless face  now it has personality  laura can you try to look at its chest it has a little blue glimmer in it climb down and look and  see if you can  liam yeah im more comfortable drawing mustaches on it 
none	 than i am dickering with its power source  laura just look and see what it is  liam i look at the crystal admire it go dinkdink with a knuckle  matt you glance through this little slit and its about that wide like you can barely see the  flicker and the stone is about a good foot and a half two feet deep before you even see the source  of the light its a very very thin slit to it and from what little bit you can see you see the  gem is embedded in 
none	 there with multiple metallic and stone things keeping it suspended there  liam can i inspect the chest of this creature like its a trap  matt make an investigation check  laura can i see if the golems wearing a circlet  liam 20  matt 20 ah well he was up against its head there was no circlet on the golem looking at it  i mean theres no trap per se its part of the construct of this construct  liam whats it made of is it metal or stone  matt stone  liam is there 
none	 any way to open it from the front  matt not from what you can see no  liam okay  sam should i go upstairs and get grog just in case things get ugly  liam i add a little pointy beard on the bottom of his chin  matt okay  laura we should keep looking anybody else want to look around the room for the circlet  taliesin i feel like this is not the only room this is not enough i feel like theres  marisha yeah i start looking around to see if theres hidden 
none	 chambers  loose stones in the wall  sam keyleth dont you have something that he gave us  marisha oh thats true the hunk of quall i pull out the hunk of quall  matt okay pull it out hold it aloft it begins to glow a little bit and react the golems chest  glows a little bit and reacts in a far distant corner underneath the alchemical table in a pile  of some pieces of wood and crumpled stone theres a slight dull glow  marisha i walk over and i start brushing it away  
dung	 matt okay you pull it away you find an almost full loop of metal  marisha would it be a dark iron cobalt band  matt yeah it is actually  travis thank god for that lump of quall  sam oi did she pick it up already  matt yeah  sam didnt kill us  matt no  sam well thats good did it wake up the beast  matt no the circlets glow has faded you have it in your hand  laura well we have the thing  taliesin im going to quickly take a look 
none	 at the papers that were buried in  matt a series of notes scribbled on the paper you can see a number of sketches of the construct  of the actual golem itself pieces of its body and its form but some of its been torn and crumpled  up tossed aside failed attempts  taliesin failed attempts does he write his name anywhere  matt no  taliesin damn  marisha i take off my very prized circlet that i love oh so much  matt okay  marisha whyd you make that face  matt no nothing whatre 
none	 you doing  marisha and i put the serpent circlet on  matt okay  marisha and i concentrate to see what it feels like  matt okay  marisha and i hand my circlet to dont break it  sam of course im not going to break it  marisha its a family heirloom  sam ill have mort hold it mort  matt so the circlet floats in the air just out of reach concentrate as soon as you place it on  your head it locks to the sides of your head and you feel this cold 
none	 probing into your mind  for a moment  taliesin its installing windows  marisha not windows 10 not windows 10 god damn it  laughter  taliesin im so sorry  liam into the corner face the corner for a minute  matt its funny because its relevant all right so you feel there is a connection trying to be  made but you would need time to attune to this should you want to take the time to do so 30  minutes to an hour depending  taliesin lets take all of this out of the house 
town	 maybe  laura including the golem  marisha i want to stay here and see you guys continue looking around im going to meditate for  a second  matt grog much time goes by 20 30 minutes not a peep silence  travis can i since im bored i look up and down the street anything suspicious  matt i mean a few folks wander by looking nervous around you make a perception check  travis hey minus no plus one no laughs eightee wait  laughter  travis zero 19  matt okay you do notice on the 
town	 far end of the street there does appear to be a pair of  individuals that are leaned against a building looking right at you  travis yeah thats what i was thinking  matt theyre about a block and a half down the direction you came  travis i dont look at them can i try to attune with my new bloodaxe while im waiting  matt you can just the bloodaxe  travis both  matt okay so you sit down your hands still inside the gauntlets and take a moment to find  the connection you feel 
none	 this rush of adrenaline hit your body as your hands seem to go numb for a  moment and in a flash your eyes see the chaos of the elements of the creation of planets slamming  into flames and earth this instant vision of the very force of creation a time before  civilization and you feel that fiery wrath all of a sudden burn through your fingertips the vision  ends and you look down and as you curl your fingers strength pulses through your body that  you havent understood in a while as youre coming over 
none	 that moment the bloodaxe solidifies  in your grip and you can see where this rush could definitely send kevdaks head to get a  little big  travis sweet  taliesin the power of neil degrasse tyson is with you  laughter  liam but you know lets go kill the dragon before we get the rest of these things because  thats a good idea  taliesin because thats going to be great god  matt so you take the time and eventually the connection finds its way and theres a clarity  and you as it hits 
none	 you at the end of this restful period in the basement you open your eyes and you  feel its hard to describe a bit of coldness in your head thats off to the right side of your  head its this slight tickle of cold  liam thats no fun  marisha slight tickle of cold  matt right there almost like inside your skull  marisha i concentrate on it  matt okay  marisha and i see if i can manifest the cold  matt okay you look down at your hands and try to manifest the 
dung	 cold nothing happens  marisha i focus on the golem  matt you turn to the golem and as you turn the cold shifts to the front in the direction  of the golem  laura oh yeah yeah yeah  marisha i look at the golem and i say step forward  matt suddenly the eyes which were dark flare with bright blue light matching his chest  laura oh shit oh wait his legs are tied up  matt and as he does fwoomp boom facedown onto the ground the rope coming taut it slams  into the 
none	 floor you hear this loud impact beneath the ground  sam were okay were okay  liam i swivel out a dagger and cut right below the knot  laura he looked like a moron that was amazing  marisha and i go sorry sorry  matt no response its still facedown on the ground  laura im on the ground laughing  marisha and i go rise  liam wait wait one second one second we tied it around a lot of times hold on  matt as youre trying to cut the rope free it starts standing up 
none	 you finally pull away as its  foot backs up and almost crushes you as it rights itself and stands before you  liam look at that mustache  matt it has a majestic black mustache across its face its glowing arcanedriven eye sockets and  its pulsing blue energy source in its chest stands looking down at you intently  taliesin im going to go diving to see if theres an instruction manual somewhere in this room im  on my hands and knees going through the papers  marisha i look at the rest of them and i 
none	 go holy shit  ashley make him wave  marisha and i say your manners wave to pike  ashley keyleth thats awesome  marisha and then i say and a curtsey for vex  sam oh come on dont demean him  marisha this is the coolest  liam can it do a doublebird  marisha and i say what do we say to those who we have just vanquished  matt turns to vax big ol stony middle fingers about that wide around  marisha and i look at him and i say never forget that  sam 
none	 he doesnt have a mind  marisha he has my mind  laura 21 what i rolled  matt as you guys are scanning around the floor no sign of any sort of instruction manual the way  that things have been pulled out of here and the way the circlet was found you get the feeling as  you look about this place that in the escape quall was grabbing and drez vina were grabbing  everything they could and didnt realize until they had left that the circlet had fallen from their  grasp and been left behind 
none	 anything else they probably have that is pertaining to this  experiment  sam well we have a killing machine now  laura how do we get him out  marisha thats what i was just thinking  sam can only creatures go in your locket thing  laura i dont know  sam well probably only creatures  taliesin theres only one way to find out  laura okay yeah i pop trinket out it says a creature no more than large in size  matt hes a construct  laura so no  matt well i mean youd 
none	 have to try to find out  laura i walk up hes not going to hit me is he keyleth  marisha ill tell him not to i tell him hey whispers what should i should i say his name  does he have a name  laura spike  marisha i like it spike is he spikey at all hes bludgeony  laura i dont know i just liked the name  marisha okay i ask him are you called something  sam he doesnt have a mind  laura can he talk  matt theres no response  
none	 sam fassbender  marisha laughs fassbender no  laura why  sam too hunky  laura can he put his finger down and i hold the locket up hey fassbender  marisha enter the locket fassbender  matt puts the finger out touches the locket  sam ahh dammit  laura nope no luck  marisha good work fassbender i guess we walk him out of here  taliesin or cast a spell  sam oh if only i had any  taliesin if only he had any spells  marisha what kind of a spell  travis what are 
none	 you guys doing down there that is so loud  sam sorry we met somebody whos even stronger and awesomer than you but we still love you and  well bring him out to meet you soon  taliesin keyleth has a pet giant robot i dont know what to make of this  liam a what  taliesin its a thing ive been working on but apparently someone else has done it first so  never mind  marisha its a thing youve been working on  taliesin never mind im not working on it anymore  laughter  
none	 sam you can do a pocket fisherman instead  taliesin its passé and stupid i dont want to hear about it  matt so whats the plan  marisha i walk him out  sam wait oh no hes not a creature i cant make him invisible  matt i mean he is a creature just the particular enchantment based on this you get the  sense that as part of the realm of the raven queen is the living and the dead and this is not  necessarily a living creature its a construct and the magic does not 
none	 have an effect on it  sam oh any magic  matt that magic  sam i could try to make him invisible  laura oh thats good  sam it says creature  marisha scanlan do you have a circlet right now you had the ioun stones do you have anything on  your head  sam i am fully attuned  matt yeah this requires attunement to wear  liam keyleth is this something youre going to want to do in the long term  marisha well my circlet im a bit attached to it and its very 
none	 nice and has a lot of benefits to it  liam so if were going to go to the trouble of taking this thing out of here one of us has to  use it what about your pompom or what did you call him  ashley poppop poppop could do it but i dont know if he would be very  marisha i can wield i can use him honestly fassbender might be something that we use  sometimes and not all the time anyway maybe  taliesin could we get him into the bag of holding  liam 
none	 i doubt it  matt has to fit through the opening  taliesin yeah we dont have a big enough bag of holding  liam ooh i have an invention idea could you build a little gnome chair for either scanlan or  pike or wilhand on the back of it  laura but i think he moves rather slow  taliesin yes it would be so mad max it would be beyond thunderdome  liam i dont get that reference but i think you feel me  laura how fast can he run  marisha well lets try it 
none	 i guess  taliesin perhaps lets try this somewhere that is not a basement filled with chemicals  sam we can try this in the mansion if we can get him through the door  marisha lets make him invisible and get him to the mansion  sam ill try to turn him invisible i dont think itll work though but  matt you cast the spell for a second using your bardic flair you wink and reach out and touch the  golem and the golems form vanishes  sam hey thats great all right lets get outta here 
none	 then  matt you tell it to follow  marish lets see how this works follow  matt stomping  laura well hes rather loud  matt as you guys come to the doorway and begin stepping through you watch as the doorframe goes  breaking metal and its bent outward like something bursting out of a tuna can  laughter  marisha shit hey vex do you have a pass without a trace handy  laura let me see how many spells i have left i think i do yeah i can do pass without a trace i  
none	 have a couple left  ashley i couldnt possibly use my glove of storing could i to hold his hand  matt you can try you know from your experience that the glove of storing is usually  for handheld objects  ashley all right  laura im going to cast pass without a trace on all of us including the golem  matt okay  marisha and im going to tell the golem to walk quietly and stealth or attempt to as best as he can  matt stomping you guys make your way up the stairs as you 
none	 make it up towards the top of the  stair landing you hear the crashing of wood behind you as the golem begins making its way up  the staircase destroying it in the process  marisha stammering what why is it no  sam hes wider than the stairs  marisha why is it going up the staircase  sam because were going up the staircase  marisha oh were going oh i thought we were outside the front door  matt no this is all down in the basement you guys make your way up as it tears 
none	 through the  stairs there is a stonework incline the stairs are built on so it just destroys the wood but it  still manages to make its way up into the house itself breaking through the banister you dont  even see it you just see parts of the house sounds of destruction it steps forward into the center of  the room on one of the plates that you had marked the thing goes impact and stops in the middle  of the air before a couple smoke sparks go sparks  laura this thing is awesome  
none	 matt another one impacts  liam i feel like quall didnt really think this through  sam are you still unclear about whether we should kill this dragon or not we have a killing machine now  liam does it fly  sam it doesnt matter he can catch it with his hand  laura thats true he actually might be able to hold onto it at least for a little bit  matt the golems about 12 feet tall ten to 12 the dragons like 30 to 40  sam yeah yeah  laura so the dragon could probably 
none	 like fly away with it  taliesin the dragon would find him a very uncomfortable horse pill to swallow  sam however him plus a bunch of other people could probably hold the dragon  marisha lets get back to the mansion  laura wait can he get through the mansion door  taliesin we will tell him delicately to kneel and crawl  marisha i mean its a magic door scanlan can you just make the door a little bigger to fit him  sam why dont we have him smash through it who cares we dont live here 
town	  liam were talking about your mansion door  matt you guys all look at grog across the street sitting clutching the bloodaxe almost in a lotus  position looking at it  liam hey buddy whatcha doing over there  matt you guys glance up and see grog smiling as suddenly behind them crashing the doorway  blows out and wood gets thrown out in the middle of the roadway splintered ruin theres a giant  dome shape of the front of the house where brick and wood has been blown out  travis you guys the door is 
town	 exploding move this way i race across the street to them with  the bloodaxe in my hands  matt okay you get halfway across pass them before whack something hits you really hard in  the face and you can already feel the blood running in the back of your sinuses  marisha and i say grog meet fassbender fassbender grog  travis i dont understand what youre telling me right now  marisha hes invisible but hes a giant stone golem  travis can i reach out with my hand and try and touch whatever it was that 
none	 smashed me in the face  matt you reach out and theres a very solid surface in front of you  marisha and i say fassbender shake grogs hand remember manners  matt you reach up as youre feeling out all of a sudden a giant form grasps you from behind and  shakes your hand roll a strength check  marisha ooh  sam your arm gets torn off  laura oh god  liam also i lost a hitpoint when he flicked me in the nuts nothing nothing  travis a new strength check right 19  matt 
none	 19 as this invisible hand meets the strength is overwhelming and then as you focus  you take over the handshake and force it to move your way  sam ooh youre stronger than the thing  matt you are stronger than it  travis what the fuck is grabbing my hand  marisha fassbender scanlan named him  travis yeah you keep saying that word i dont know what it means  laura well show you what he looks like in the mansion i see youre wearing the gauntlets grog  travis yeah ive been wearing them  ashley

none	 laura probably shouldve brought a ranger with you im really good at tracking  sam fuck i dont know what you people can do  laughter  travis outstanding  matt so now as the sun is disappearing right behind the mountains and nighttime is coming you  lead vax southward through westruun dodging around a few patrolling goliath herd members and  eventually find your way to the alley where the entrance to the sewer the protruding entrance  existed where you left dr dranzel and kaylie and a number of survivors that were in the ruined  temple 
none	 of arathis  sam okay vax i know that you are an expert tracker right  liam im pretty good ive watched my sister do it  sam wait youre not the one  liam you know that my name is vax right  sam yeah i know arent you the tracker guy  liam sort of  sam i dont know dont you move in the night and do things  liam i do have really good eyes do you want me to have a look  sam can we go in the sewer and see if we can 
none	 figure out where they went  liam lets have a look  sam they went down here and they went towards the city wall thats all i know  liam lets go  sam okay  matt all right dranzel closed it behind him you go ahead and grab it make a strength check  sam well i cant lift anything  liam could we do it together could i help him give him advantage  sam whoop natural 20  cheering  matt well say between the two of you pulling scanlan most of the weight you manage to 
none	  strained sounds  sam cmon pull your weight man  matt pull the grate it scrapes and you manage to haul it off to the side its still a difficult  process but you do manage enough strength in the two of you to pull it off  liam your forearms are like popeye motherfucker  sam yes they are years of use  matt the stench of the sewer immediately hits your nose there is a metal ladder that leads down  into the subterranean area  sam all right where do we go  liam i well 
none	 lets see if she left any my sister looks for tracks you really shouldve  brought my sister im going to check for tracks  matt okay make a survival check  liam survival check okay well  matt oh wait no is this for checking for traps or tracking  liam tracks footprints  laura is that what you said  liam i said tracks im not looking for traps were in the sewer tracks  matt yes survival  sam dyou need an article of her clothing for a scent  liam 17 im concentrating on the mud 
none	  matt as youre down inside the sewer there is a recess in the center of the floor where most of  the various sludge runs through there are bits of runoff from when the rain does pour through and  it rains fairly often here in this part of taldorei where bits of mud and compost that get  caught on the sides are you do manage to find a few spots that appear like footsteps you dont  know who from it appears some sort of humanoids footsteps over an area that heads southward  liam i hold 
dung	 my foot over one is it smaller than mine or is it about the same size  matt the one you see is about the same size  sam there were some humanoids humans with us we were traveling with a bunch of people  liam yeah okay well i mean they wouldve washed away if they were old so probably pretty  new lets follow them  sam you are the expert  liam i clearly am  laughter  liam lets go  sam shit  liam yeah ill lead the way  matt okay you continue both 
none	 of you guys make stealth checks  liam yeah okay  sam seven im just excited  travis going to see my daughter  liam 33  matt okay you guys continue finding your way weaving through the southern area following the  tracks they vanish and youll see a couple footprints here and then you guys will lose the  trail the scent is terrifying and getting worse the further south you progress you do head into  one central chamber and both of you guys make perception checks  sam huh 19  liam 30  sam okay 
none	  matt you both stop in as you immediately see in the center of this room a large bulbous form that  is massed in the center you both stop  liam quiet quiet  sam im always quiet  matt it is not moving  sam oh okay  laura oh my god did you send your daughter down to get attacked by a giant bulbous shit  sam can we go around it  marisha its true there were like a bunch of slimes and stuff down there  liam so were in a larger chamber and its 
none	 in the middle  matt yeah its like a fourway four different platforms or passages merge in the center here  where one of the drains leads down into  liam and are there any of the footprints left anywhere  matt i mean you do see bits of sludge around and there are a number of footprints that are all  scattered around some smeared some skidding  liam i reach down and i scoop scanlan up in football pose again which way do you want to go  i cant tell which way your daughter reach deep man 
none	  sam can i sense which direction the wall of city is like do i have any sort of  matt make a survival check  sam survival ive never done this before 13  matt 13 keeping track of where you were and the direction you gather its probably that way  sam oh i lets go that way  liam shh  sam whispering sorry lets go that way  liam dont move  sam all right  matt as you carefully move past you look and you see you did encounter one of these entities  before 
none	 when you were tracking down the rakshasa its a terrible swollen creature with tendrils a  mouth it feeds on refuse and rot this was a rather swollen and dangerouslooking one however  as you pass by and look you see a series of wounds across its body and its lifeblood dripping  out this one has been slain  liam im going to set you down all right i think your daughter done killed a  oogedyboogedy  sam what how do you know that  liam sit down its dead  sam oh oh good  matt survival 
none	 check again you followed the tracks  travis are there any track marks  liam 12 i already asked that  matt the tracks vanish youre not sure how to follow a direction  liam is there any blood or ooze walking away i mean dripping away from there  matt i mean it all congeals in this general area most of the central room the middle area is  very clustered with slime and goop theres no natural flow and there hasnt been a very recent  rainfall so there isnt a fresh flow of water through here either 
town	  liam and where were they going where did you tell them to go  sam out of town get out of town  liam do i know where that is which direction that is down here  matt i mean based on where youre going you guys can follow that path and well say for the  sake of brevity you eventually find your way to a portion of the sewer dodging a few shadylooking  areas to where a final grate leads out into the night because it is night at this point in time  its a 
none	 large tenfoottall circular grate if you look the bars are actually bent open and it leads  outward the liquid from the sewage now spills out into this small ravine in the very southern  portion of westruun and leads out into  liam sort of like this or is it  matt no its up like this its vertical  liam vertical and what do we see past the bars  matt you see the open plains south of westruun  sam no sign of tracks anyone huddled for safety  matt i mean looking around you can see 
none	 a few footprints scattered footprints you can make a  survival check  sam pff ten  liam 12  matt ten nothing that specifically catches your attention  liam i think she got outta here pal  sam balls  liam but shes not here  sam thats true  liam shes better off  sam all right all right sorry wild goose chase  liam no no dont worry about it you want to talk about it  sam no no i just dont know when ill see her again so ill find her again thats all itll 
none	  be good  liam i believe that too  sam yeah oh and hey thank you back at the sphinx your sister was unconscious and you dove  in to save me that was very nice  liam i knew she would be taken care of and i wasnt sure about you  sam because you love me  liam youre very entertaining and i would be sad to see you go  sam well i owe you one forever and i hate to say it but i feel terrible about it but i think  i mightve killed 
none	 a couple of civilians because i feel like i owe you some some help  liam what do you mean  sam well i was in the big fight back there i couldve hurt you or the civilians but i decided  to hurt the civilians because ive got to protect you because you protected me  liam well theres no right or wrong but next time ill be all right you help people more in  need than me and ill be all right  sam all right next time  liam i dont know any of your fancy 
none	 you know fluhduhduh but  sam well im no ranger like you  laughter  liam there is no ranger like me this is stupid we should go back  sam through the sewers again  liam yeah i mean we dont have big man with us and i dont want to run into any of his third  cousins or whatever so yeah  sam all right ill lead the way  liam might as well  matt eventually you guys make your way back  taliesin not going to make them roll survival to get back  laura 
none	 you guys are lost forever in the sewers  matt little roundabout but they get there eventually they return to the mansion  marisha status gained fall into a pile of shit never to get out  matt smelling awful all right so you wanted to go ahead and do some exercises with fassbender  marisha i do want to do some exercises with fassbender  laura laughs who doesnt  marisha who doesnt want to do exercises with fassbender abs of stone that fassbender  liam p90x with fassbender  laughter  marisha okay hes not invisible anymore right 
none	 you dropped that im assuming he dropped sure  matt thats faded by now yeah  travis ohh i get it makes so much sense shit he is huge fuck now i get it all right hes  with us got it  marisha he is with us yeah  travis understand  marisha oh yeah oh sorry grog fassbender fassbender grog  travis his name is fassbender  ashley i call him fluffy  travis fluffy it is  marisha im terrible at naming things i just go with whatever the first person shouts out  laura thats a 
none	 lie because i said spike  marisha oh you did say spike we overruled it with fassbender  laughter  taliesin she goes with the second thing that everybody shouts out  matt too late now its in stone  taliesin literally  liam its like an improv show salty mcfucknuts  laughter  marisha spike ehhh not that one  matt it basically is yeah  marisha okay so first i say fassbender run and i want to see how fast he can go  matt and he runs about the same speed you do i mean as far 
none	 as its bigger steps but it gets about  the same distance  marisha okay and i say fassbender punch grog hes used to this grogs fine with it  matt do you do anything  travis no yeah i totally take it  marisha this is how we train with grog its fine  laura youre healed youre healed up  travis enough  matt the golem pulls back whoosh swings at you with a giant fist that is a 19  travis yeah that wait well i took off yeah i did take off my bracers of defense 
none	 so  that hits  matt all right whack right square to the side of the face and jaw you take from the impact of  its giant batteringramlike arm 24 points of bludgeoning damage  all oh  matt youre not raging so its not halved  travis okay tit for tat bitch and i swing back with the titanstone knuckles and punch fassbender  in the face  matt okay go ahead and roll for an attack  laura do we know if we can heal him once we damage him  marisha well find out  travis 
tavern	 28  matt that hits so you do one plus the plus seven strength damage to it so eight points of  travis of the four or the six because its my fist  matt huh well its not a save your fists for this because youre not a tavern brawler and were  saying because youre not like on even ground with the other guy youre doing boom one point of  damage from the punch plus seven for the strength so eight points of damage from the crack as the  fist hits it does cause like a 
none	 crack where the impact hits a little bit  marisha i say okay all right enough hitting each other enough of that  travis well hold on we were just getting warmed up i mean this is where the game starts you  know its like ping and then you really start playing  laura ping you can  travis its a song  marisha theres some other questions first other questions first i cast call lightning  matt okay  taliesin im going to get in the way of this just for fun  sam indoors by the way 
none	  marisha and i just its fine i bring down a bolt of lightning on a dummy and then see if i  can also command fassbender to punch a dummy  matt okay bolt of lightning hits a dummy the dummy is shattered as you command fassbender  fassbender leaps forward at another dummy whoosh giant haymaker and causes the dummy to explode  into a bunch of fluff and cloth  marisha so would we say that would be like a bonus action what i just did  matt no  marisha no it was an action for 
none	 each  matt i mean you have to focus on it yeah i mean you can give it you have an action to  give it a command and itll continue the command as it goes  taliesin so once its set in that motion itll continue to kill that thing  marisha okay so then theoretically i can have a concentration spell up and be like kill that  thing and they wont overlap  matt hmm lets see  liam yknow while he looks that up let me point out that when i punched percy in the face 
none	 there  were zero points of hitpoint damage  laughter  sam hey now rangers arent very strong  liam yes yes i did punch him  taliesin i want to check by the way liam are you imagining the eightiesera xmen danger room  right now too with like the hoops and the bars  all ohh  liam yeah metal rods and nightcrawler going  matt it takes an action to focus and give it a new command  marisha a new command  matt yes once it is commanded it will continue to do it until told 
none	 otherwise or it completes  whatever task it was given  marisha its not a concentration to keep up that command so like keep fighting the dragon until  it hits the ground would theoretically be one command that would keep going  matt based on your experience with it so far theoretically it should work  marisha okay  liam robotic voice whatever keyleth wants keyleth gets  marisha thank you speak and spell we found out if it can talk  taliesin ask a question  marisha fassbender  laughter  marisha fassbender how many years old are 
none	 you hold up hold on how old are you  matt no response  taliesin all right this is good were finding out its intelligence level  marisha can you gesture to me with your fingers and tell me how many years old you are  whispers i dont think hes listening  taliesin it may not be smart enough to know that  marisha hes distracted  matt yeah there its no response  taliesin so it doesnt know anything thats good lets find out if it can does it have any  magical properties beyond punching can it 
none	 tell it to use magic  marisha okay hey fassbender cast a spell on percy  laughter  sam deaths eye  taliesin and then i die  liam disintegrate beam straight on  taliesin and then you dye a blue streak in your hair and everything goes fine  matt it turns over brings its hands up like this make a wisdom saving throw  sam oh my god  marisha well look i wanted a live test subject  taliesin no no im with you im with you  travis thats my designation  taliesin natural one  
none	 laura oh no  matt laughs you feel like  marisha hey to percy  taliesin no no no its happening  matt youve been near explosions before not like super close but big enough where you feel like the  concussive wave from a distance not enough to harm you but enough to like send you off your  balance for a moment you feel that impact and as you fall onto your back foot time around you  seems to be moving faster that youd expect and slowmo voice you find your motion sluggish  sam oh thats 
none	 slow  matt slowmo voice and you really have a hard time really moving  marisha thats awesome  taliesin slowmo voice this put  ashley its youre in slowmo  taliesin slowmo voice the candle  marisha percy youre in slowmo youre slowmo percy  taliesin slowmo voice back  marisha its amazing  laura how do we fix him  marisha itll wear off  matt make another wisdom saving throw  liam how will he do zingers now  taliesin wisdom where are we 16  liam slowmo voice were slow  matt slowmo voice not really 
none	 changing  laura oh no  marisha all right fassbender can you drop this  liam bet he cant  taliesin you asked him a question as opposed to telling him to do it  marisha fassbender drop the spell  matt slowmo voice no apparent change in percy normal voice he stands there  laura oh no  marisha itll wear off okay fassbender do you know any other spells and if so cast them at the  dummy this time  matt looks at the dummy looks back at you  marisha i go up to fassbender and 
none	 i cast stone shape on his chest and see if i can repair that crack  actually before i do that can i do a level one cure wounds to see if i can heal him  first okay  matt go ahead and roll for that  marisha do i roll a d20 for it  sam hes talking to a whale right now somewhere  marisha eight points  taliesin slowmo hate you  laughter  liam tell us all about the nature of politics  laura just think the fun thing is i think youre aging much 
none	 slower than the rest of us  matt okay this is this hmm  taliesin laughs this is the most torturous thing ever  matt so you go ahead and reach out and touch it and the healing magic seeps up into the crack that  grog left behind and the crack fuses shut  laura thats cool thats cool  matt for how much was the total  marisha eight points  matt yeah fuses shut entirely its like there was no crack  marisha so he gets healed by a heal  matt about a minute passes and 
none	 then you come back to your normal pace  taliesin no its no its good  marisha how was that how did that feel was it frustrating  taliesin yes  marisha good good  laughter  taliesin can it  marisha thank you thats all i need  taliesin can it fly  marisha ooh fassbender can you i dont think he can fly  taliesin just try it  marisha fassbender can you fly  liam tell it  marisha fly fassbender fly  taliesin how high did it jump  marisha how high is it jumping  
none	 matt its getting six feet off the ground vertically and then landing with a heavy impact  each time causing these divots to continuously push into the ground  laura ooh i wonder if it can like earthquake  marisha okay i stone shape i take a chunk of the wall and i stone shape a boulder and i hand  it to him and i say throw it at that target  matt tiny little boulder  marisha yeah  matt it hits the target the stone shatters across it  marisha so his aims pretty good  taliesin 
none	 all right  laura nice  marisha and then i go fassbender highfive  yeah  matt you take two points of bludgeoning damage  marisha ahh  matt unable to control its force  marisha mm yeah youre my buddy fassbender  taliesin out of idle curiosity two last important things that i would recommend  marisha okay  taliesin perhaps fassbender go into recharge mode or sleep mode perhaps so that maybe it can  regain some of its magic ability which it might burn through and two and im surprised that im  the one to mention 
none	 this but we should doublecheck to make sure that that thing isnt  doing anything strange to your head  matt for the record while this has happened mort whos been following you guys around because  its not concentration the circlet that he was carrying the one that you previously had hit the  ground and is lying there on the ground  taliesin im going to pick that up  marisha thank you  taliesin all right its very nice  marisha thank you its very old okay fassbender rest  matt the eyes go to a very 
none	 very dull glow its form tends to slightly hunch forward in the  position it was at rest when you found it in the basement seems to have gone into some sort of a rest state  marisha okay  taliesin take that off for a bit maybe  marisha but i like it  laura try taking it off kiki  marisha its my friend  taliesin itll be your friend in the morning  marisha okay i take it off  matt as you reach up you go to pull it off your head  and it slides 
none	 off without a problem  shouting  laura i am going to throw something at you  travis thats like the fifth time today and its so good  ashley you sneakysneaky  travis no like a good horror movie fakeouts  ashley as you take it off your head  sam your eyes start to bleed  marisha i take it off  taliesin seems all right  marisha do i look funny  taliesin more than normal oh no you dont look different  marisha youre a dick  taliesin i know well you made a robot cast

none	 thatll help with this  if any  that you have prepared  ashley whered it go whered it go it was right can i  matt theres a level one spell detect good and evil if you have that prepared that would detect  for an evil entity  laura do you have identify  travis no  matt identify is more of an arcanebased  travis what do you think  matt that would be like scanlan or any other arcane casters you would know  ashley can i perception check it  laura do you have identify 
none	  sam im not there  laura im asking you not you  ashley insight check it can i  sam youll have to butter me up first  matt i mean its hard to insight check something thats not living from what you can tell theres  no communication theres nothing it just looks like an axe  ashley ill learn that spell and ill check it later  travis oh you cant tell anything  ashley i cant tell anything right now it looks pretty normal and its a good sign that its not  talking to you

none	 damage is doubled  travis oh just damage 25 25  matt that was pretty funny all right so as you rear back your fist slams into the stonework here  of your magnificent mansion the stonework shatters eight up to 16 points of damage from the  sheer punch against the wall the stone sends a crack through that actually pierces to the top of  the rather large 25foot ceiling here in the training area that has been crafted by scanlan  stones tumble and hit the ground a bunch of it plaster and pieces fall and hit 
none	 the area around  you causing a small pile of wreckage pretty solid punch  ashley whoa  travis i remember being little and kevdak went and punched a boulder and it went like  stone shattering and split in half  ashley whoa and you just did it with the hands  travis yeah were going to be busting balls big time  ashley can i swing the axe  travis yeah at me  ashley no at the dummy im going to try it im going to try swinging the axe at the dummy  matt it sticks

none	  marisha all right well when are we going to talk amongst ourselves  travis we should do that now  laura short short talk  taliesin i dont feel comfortable fighting a dragon on 24 hours notice after almost getting my  arse handed to me  travis all right thats percys vote keyleth what do you say  marisha can i pass and wait to hear other peoples thoughts  travis sure vax what do you say  liam much to my own chagrin im in perfect agreement with frederick von whatsitface de rolo  de whatsit  
none	 travis vex  laura i am i stand by what i said before i think we should let them go out and fight a  dragon and we try to rescue the city while they are distracted  travis badass handsmasher the first  sam thats you pike  ashley thats me im having trouble what are you thinking  travis i wouldnt care if we left now i dont think were ready i think it would be foolish i  learned a lesson yesterday and im anxious to die dont get me wrong but id rather win if we 
none	  planned a little better than lose  laura are there any big trees in the city  taliesin thats not a lot of people we need to move a lot of people how many people are in  theory still left in the city  matt you have no idea  laura an entire fucking city  marisha i think a lot  matt i mean a lot of people have left and gone to kymal a lot have left and gone to the foramere  basin which you already saw and a lot of people are still within 
none	 the city and currently being  lorded over and runor were by the herd you dont know quite how many still remain youve  seen many jump between homes and a few thatve waited for this whole thing to blow over  taliesin based on the size of the city and the number of people ive seen what would be my  extrapolation im a reasonable human being triple digits four digits  matt i mean youre looking at maybe four digits low four digits  taliesin low four digits thatll do  sam listen we have this herd they 
none	 will be our allies for exactly one day  travis in theory  sam in theory so if we do not use them to attack dragons can we at least use them to do something  because they will no longer ever be our allies again after today we could use them to go try to  kill the dragon on their own we could use them to try to kill something or someone else for us we  could use them to try to help clear the city if we convinced them that it was in their best  
none	 interest to  travis ill amend my proposition to this im not sure what that word means  sam this  travis yes if we go and speak to zanror and we cant change his mind about fighting this dragon  which im not entirely comfortable asking him to do we at least get the innocents prisoners and  hostages out of the city we pretend that were going to fight the dragon with him and when shit  goes down we wait  marisha thats actually what i was thinking  taliesin this is not a bad plan  
none	 marisha we have the means to bail us out very quickly if things go wrong  travis and if i may in case any of your consciences are in conflict the herd is full of  murderers and pillagers and rapists and child killers the worst of the lot and only when i was  younger did i not know the difference between right and wrong still working on that definition  but i can tell you this group aint the best lot in the world and they mean nothing to me compared  to the people in this room 
town	  marisha conversely you were a part of that lot once and you came out of it  travis once but are we trying to save a herd or are we trying to save a town  marisha i think were trying to save the world at this point  travis thats bigger than a town right  liam by a bit  laura a little  taliesin today we can save a town  sam you know were all gathered here together so id like to take this opportunity with  wilhands blessing to propose marriage to you pike 
none	 trickfoot will you make me the happiest  gnome ever im sorry i couldnt contain myself any longer  ashley that was so sudden  sam i know im sorry ive been thinking about it all night tonight i went looking for kaylie  she wasnt there and then im sorry i blurted it out its just were all together were never  all together like this so  liam can i roll stealth and hide right now  laughter  matt go ahead  ashley can i roll stealth and hide right now  matt you can try to

none	 vax here  matt no  travis shit i wanted to put like shaving cream in his hand and tickle his nose with a feather  marisha although i feel like we still need to finish this conversation  shouldnt we all be present  travis whats left to finish  taliesin other than take a rest  sam were going to try to convince them to delay if they wont delay then we say all right  lets go fight and we send them into battle  laura and then we dont really fight  marisha huh  laura 
none	 well we see how they do and we try to rescue people  marisha maybe its time to split up maybe some of us help fight the dragons while  others help evacuate  laura no im not separating from you when we go fight a giant fucking dragon  taliesin i may run to try and quietly by myself grab a few things from the library that we may  need for the next vestiges  marisha youre going tonight  taliesin ah possibly in the morning  marisha ill go with you  matt you do recall based 
none	 on your previous scrying spell  marisha it was ruined and most of it had been picked clean  matt it was ruined a lot of it picked over allura was escaping with a couple of tomes under  her arms before escaping via spark  taliesin oh all right then  marisha i mean it doesnt mean that theres not something still potentially there but im sure  allura got most of the good stuff shes not stupid  taliesin no thats fair  marisha we can still check it out  matt so whats the plan  travis 
none	 we go to sleep  liam i dont have a plan but while theyre all dicking about after about an hour of staring at  the wall i start talking to the air and say you know ive never put much stock in faith and for  the life of me i question so much why my sister took that broom and i cant figure out another  reason for her to have done it other than fate for i would not be standing here nor would anyone  else in my family so you werent my first choice but 
none	 im over that and im ready i will  come to you as soon as i am able i dont know how any of this works im coming whatever we need to  do i dont know what i believe but i made a promise and im sticking to it and im coming to  you so just hang on  matt minutes of silence pass no response nothing  liam i go to bed  matt okay as you get to your bed you look down and a single black feather is currently set on the  pillow before

none	 very smooth with everybody else i dont know what it is  ashley its just that its fine its okay i have to confess something to you when you gave me  that letter  sam yes  ashley when you told me not to read it until you died  sam yes  ashley i read it immediately after you left because curiosity gets the best of me sometimes i  cant its not  sam but you cant youre like a priest or something you cant lie  ashley i know but that what does that even mean 
none	  sam i dont know i  ashley i go back and forth with it  sam there was personal stuff in there  ashley i know but what i know it was very personal and i just wanted to tell you that  everything you said in that letter i promise to you  sam you do  ashley that i give you my word that everything you said in that letter i promise to you i will do  sam really  ashley if you die  laughter  ashley which i am hoping that you never do

none	 if it does that makes me feel a little bit better  about things  ashley okay well i love you  sam sleep tight  ashley i give him a hug and a kiss on his cheek  matt okay  sam i kick the dirt a little bit and then i walk away and i click my heels little jumpandclick  matt and anything else before the evenings rest comes all right sleep finds you all some  easier than others until a measured period of time i believe  travis yeah  matt grog sprung awake gathered 
town	 the folks in the predawn hour of the following morning you gather  your stuff exit the mansion and start making your way towards the margraves house  travis is there anyone on the street  matt make a perception check  travis 19 plus zero  matt you guys exit wilhands place and there is a crossstreet that wilhands home is nearby thats  like a building sandwiching it on each side and the one just south of it is on the corner of that  cross street across the way as you guys exit the room or exit 
none	 the front of the building you see  two figures stand up arms crossed the same individuals you saw earlier  marisha of wilhands place  travis same people i saw outside of the house earlier all right fuck this shit i turn and i  walk towards those two people  matt okay you approach you recognize them theyre the same two people that were watching you  while you guys were resting directly after the battle with kevdak in the center of the square the two  that were assigned to keep an eye on you  travis 
none	 hello whatre your two names  matt they look at each other veskin mortar what do you want  travis funny i feel like ive seen you about in the last few hours watching us  matt keeping an eye out  travis huh why  matt because you killed our leader takes a while to see what strength is a man whos killed  your leader if hes a murderer if hes an honorbound man or if hes a piece of shit that  you should wipe off your heels  travis hm  matt takes a bit of 
none	 watching to get that jurys still out  travis dont you have a new leader now  matt they look at each other maybe  travis would you like to walk with us were going for a little morning stroll  matt nothing else to do  and they wipe a little bit of sleep from one of the corner of the eye lead on  travis and we head to the margraves house  matt okay  marisha i put my oldschool circlet back on by the way but i have the other circlet with me  matt okay 
town	 so youve reattuned to the original circlet you guys walking through the town as you  do there is a bit of business there are some of the street lanterns have been lit where  previously at this hour they would be greatly diminished there is movement you see some of  the herd that are now wandering forth armoring up gathering weapons you know this  this is the morning before a siege this is the predawn meditation before the herd takes its  next yeah warpaint being applied breakfasts being enjoyed people preparing themselves for the  frenzy 
none	 of battle this is the prewar ritual of the herd of storms as you make your way  southward across the oncebattlefield returnedtownsquare outside the margraves home  to the front doors the door is open and you see there are two individuals sitting at the front  one of which is a goliath keeping watch to the right of him on the other side is a grufflooking  female human humanoid sitting there arms crossed watching as you guys approach  travis i make eye contact with both of them i seek an audience with zanror  matt hes 
town	 expecting you get in  travis we go in  matt so you guys walk into the house you see the interior of the margraves abode across the way  there is a haphazard throne thats been built from lumber and carts and things that were pulled from  resources within the town you can see this is probably where kevdak sat once they had taken  the home the estate  travis i grab my earpiece and very lightly say vax keep your eyes about you  matt are you all entering with grog  all yeah sure  
none	 sam should we leave a couple outside or anything or no  travis nope stay together  matt okay you guys all enter into the foyer area the throne is across the way theres a long  hallway that leads to the back of the estate and at the very back you can see the throne there are  some low sconces in the walls that give the flicker of light in the center there is a round  table which is currently set there are some weapons and daggers a few javelins tossed onto  it looks like some 
none	 fruit thats partially eaten and there on the table you see zanror already  armored up arms splayed across the side looking down at the table looking down at the weapons  before him behind him you see his wife the lady the other pregnant goliath that is currently  behind rubbing his shoulders and talking to him into his ear they both look up and see as you  approach at which point zanror whispers to her for a second  laura what does he say  matt he says we have company they both sit back as he 
dung	 goes upright as you approach glad to  see you had the sense to take my summons so nows the day where we prepare  travis aye wouldnt miss it for the world  matt sighs first and foremost grog take that shit off its really freaking out most of our people  travis it is pretty sweet though isnt it  matt its confusing to say the least aye  travis we all have our preparations to make before battle dont worry about mine  matt to each their own i suppose heh youve fallen in some strange paths 
none	 since we last met  travis you have no idea  matt rest of you can we expect your attendance in this glorious fight  liam wherever grog goes we go as well  matt good good  marisha i suppose we could ask the same of your herd leader zanror  matt were prepared now and weve met around with the remaining herd weve spread the tale of  kevdaks fall demanded solidarity under my arms and yours and our plan to show our strength and  independence from his reign by cutting down the black dragon of gatshadow 
none	 many are easily swayed  by words of bloodshed and glory others the hesitation in their eyes worries me now  greenbeard had set us down a path of ruin coming here we conquer and move as a people this  life without roaming lording over a broken city living under the thumb of a drake this is not our  life since greenbeards age and selfishness had caught up to him kevdaks lust for the fear of  others swayed his judgment into more selfindulgent territory and while we all quelled  rebellion gathered gold and goods while i 
none	 parlayed with that beast my uncle stayed in  here points back at the throne behind him taking his drink and his women breaking those  who could not defend themselves out of idle boredom i could see it regret hed listened to  the old man and led us into ruin but the only thing stronger than kevdaks might was his pride  so we stayed he could not admit he was wrong he abandoned reason and foresight and i questioned  him our actions here in the city our future he beat me and threw me into chains 
town	 so learning from  the mistakes here when this dragon is done we leave we have no place in this city  laura you speak of pride of listening to reason might be smart to listen to reason in this  instance as well that dragon is ancient and very large its quite possible hell wipe out all of  us the town included it might be smart to swallow our pride for the day and prepare come  back when we have preparations made and we can take the dragon down  matt please understand the dragon has claimed 
town	 quite the tithe from our people weve provided  what we can what we could scavenge but even then the coffers of this town that we could acquire are  growing thin the reason that we were preparing for this attack even before you arrived is because  we were at the end of our rope many of the people made away from this town with their goods before  we came and many still have escaped our grasp when we took over so the paltry sums that we  could gather in the time that we did hold reign 
none	 over westruun the dragon is not going to be  happy that each package dwindles with each passing couple of days either we take this element of  surprise and fight it on our own terms or we wait for it to come to us angry on its and if we  leave now the herd may survive but i havent heard of a dragon that when crossed lets that  vengeance fly and ill be honest with you we leave a trail behind us as you know  travis that i do it is a wide wake my friend 
none	  matt at this point the door slams open behind you guys you see a muscular man walks in skin  sunscarred and calloused his long black hair clustered in wild unkempt clumps a wild elf  tress who accompanied you to the square naught but earlier the day before walks in behind him  ivon your timing is good we speak on at which point this man steps forward to the table pushing  you guys aside and looking directly at zanror we do not recognize you zanror kevdak was the  thunderlord who conquered the river maw and 
none	 now hes dead you take his title unearned and intend  to lead us into suicide against a dragon that even kevdak feared we will not stand for this the  river maw are picking up and leaving now we return to our fens to lead our people you can  all die for your own reasons zanror leans forward very serious a grave look on his face  are you saying youre abandoning the herd at which point you can see theres tension in his  muscles and you can see tress currently reaching back for a weapon and 
none	 ivon not breaking a sweat  leans into his face square chiseled jaw going yeah i guess thats what im saying herd of  storms is no more if youre going to lead us into death wed rather live on back to the lives we  had before you came in and mucked it up close the doors zanror says and the door shuts behind  sam shit  matt zanror looks to you what do you say grog strongjaw slayer of kevdak he who raises might  against the dragon  travis thunderlord we back your play  matt 
none	 the rest of you those who travel this world afar outside of our people where does your  allegiance lie  sam well certainly not with the cowards whore abandoning you in the face of a tough fight  matt ivon turns to you now eyes red with fury whore you calling a coward little man  travis watch where you turn your gaze it may be the last movement your head makes attached  to your body  matt make an intimidation check  travis oh thats not good ten  matt ten  sam im dead  matt 
none	 hes still staring at scanlan spits spits right in your face  sam thats not very nice  matt no its not neither is calling me a coward  sam well im just a guest here so i dont want to spill anyones blood in someone elses throne  room so ill be the bigger man and take a step back  matt as you take a step back he stands back up turns to zanror zanror open the door let us go  live our lives and you can run into whatever fires you want the last thing we 
none	 need is a civil  war this morning what do you say  laura how many people do you have with you  matt turns to you and you are  laura vexahlia  matt we take 18 with us west of the fens let us be its not fair to drag them into this chaos  ashley may i say something i realize you want to go and protect your people but even if you run  you guys will eventually come across a dragon that will kill all of your people so what if we fight  together 
none	 because theres strength in numbers  sam maybe we should just let them leave  matt make a persuasion check with disadvantage  laura why  matt because youre a tiny gnome talking up to a very burly man whos  ashley yeah but i have gnome cunning charisma  matt right go ahead and make your roll  ashley so i have advantage on charismas  matt on charismas  laughter  travis pike  ashley i do gnome cunning advantage on all intelligence wisdom and charisma  sam saves  laura saving throws  ashley oh yes i 
none	 didnt read the rest of it  matt yeah thats not really going to help with that unfortunately  ashley all right so persuasion  matt this is persuasion  ashley little persuashe all right thats a 20 fuck nine hah he laughs  matt its interesting zanror i walk into here and suddenly all the tiny people are talking for  you tress lets go  liam im a head taller talk to me  matt i aint got time for this shit anymore  liam make time blade out those dragons are going to find you and me 
none	 and everyone in this  room whether we fight them now or later the only stupid thing we can do is separate ourselves from  each other yeah keep twitching twitchy i dont want to fight this dragon today either but  stupider than that is splitting this group of powerful motherfuckers apart id rather walk away  from here id rather take everyone out of this city and build our strength and come back and  hobble this beast but the stupidest thing you could do right now is separate yourself from the  herd you make yourself weaker 
none	 you dont have them to protect you while youre in the fields  alone while that dragon belches shit on you from above youre strong these fucking guys are  strong we need to be smart your strength is shit compared to that dragon shit  matt and your tiny people are going to do better  laura our tiny people are pretty fucking powerful  ashley weve already killed dragons  sam im getting pretty sick and tired of being called tiny listen i dont want to  matt killed dragons  ashley i pull out my necklace with 
none	 the tooth on it  matt lemme see that he pulls it forward and looks it over can buy that in any caravan that  passes through  laura we killed a white dragon motherfucker  ashley i spit at his feet  sam oi forget it guys why are we trying why are we trying to convince this asshole to fight  with us lets just let him leave hes a coward  marisha zanror if he doesnt have your allegiance in this room he will not have your  allegiance on the battlefield let them go only big 
none	 men talk big words that only fail on the  battlefield he has nothing to represent any of his claims let him go  liam the only difference between you and us is that we want to actually kill this thing you want  to be a prick  marisha zanror zanror its not worth losing any of your men before we fight this dragon just  let them go youre already losing 18  matt open the door the door slowly opens behind them all right ivon you want to leave  go take your people but you better 
none	 go now because when were done cutting that dragon down  were going to come after you deserters or you can come to this fight with us yes these  dragonslayers he who fell from the sky and cut the uncuttable down we will gloriously bathe in  the blood of that beast take back the spoils that we fed it you can do what you please i have no  interest in lording over you looks about the rest of you ive got your arms at my back for  this aye  travis ashley and laura aye  
none	 matt tress puts her hand to the side ivon looks at her  well take our chances with the wild turns around and exits the room  ashley as ivon starts going out i want to trip him stick my foot out  marisha oh my god  matt all right okay  travis wars have been started over less  ashley itll probably fail  matt go ahead and make a strength check plus four to your roll is what itd be  ashley 12  matt stumbling catches himself shoots you a look  ashley sorry im so 
none	 small you probably just didnt see me  laughter  matt they both exit out the door  liam have fun melting in trails off acid and theyre gone  matt door closes  ashley dick  matt sorry about that so  laura how many do you have left after they left  matt 18 youre looking at about 25 strong we have more wounded but theyre not going to be  of use in this battle  laura 25  matt 25 strong people  sam does that include your wife  matt no shes not and she 
none	 turns around and goes i will fight in this you are not going to  keep me from glory he goes she will fight with us  travis aye she will 25 strong we have injured are no good to us neither are the prisoners or  hostages that were kept by this herd you said you have made preparations what sort of preparations  do you have in mind  matt well the creature sleeps at the top of gatshadow weve acquired an ally in this city  that seems to know a secret byway to get to the 
dung	 side of that cavern i figure that way we can go  ahead and take the fight to it where it sleeps when its not ready  travis interesting  matt cant fly if its stuck in a cave  travis very true have you seen this cave  matt only from afar but we have some scouts that are making their way there right now  travis might report back with how the size of the cave  matt should know soon  marisha if im not mistaken i recall hearing that no scouts that have been sent thus 
none	 far have  returned is that correct  matt that is correct  marisha and you have faith that these that you sent will  matt its better than not  travis do you have any interest in a tactical ambush  matt im all ears what have you got  marisha whens it due for its next pickup  matt tomorrow morning just after dawn  marisha wait 24 hours pike and i can take time and scanlan to heal some of your wounded gain a  couple more to the fight we set a trap in the morning 
none	  matt what kind of trap  laura something that explodes it  marisha something big  laura something that traps it  marisha something heavy  taliesin something even in theory that we could convince it to take back to its lair if we still  wanted to go with that we could load the next parcel with something  sam or someone  liam would three days be better than one percival  taliesin a month would be better than a week  travis dont have that one thing dragons  taliesin yes three days would always be 
dung	 better than one  travis dragons and kevdak shared one common trait arrogance in your previous dealings with  this dragon did it ever speak down to you  matt huh thats the only way it knows how to speak fucking coldminded beast  travis aye  matt cant wait to sever its head from its neck  travis perhaps if we tame your lust for blood for a day we can control all the variables that we  have by setting this trap if we go to that cave aye we will find war sooner but we know less 
none	  and the reason youre the thunderlord now is there is a better brain in that skull than there ever  was in your fathers lets use that to our advantage  matt make a persuasion check does anyone want to aid  travis dont need it  laura sings he doesnt need it  travis 19  sam he might need it  matt takes a moment well take your day set what you need well go ahead and call the troops  off for the day heal our wounded lets make this such a majestic death for this 
none	 terrible creature  marisha zanror i think percy just had an idea but vexahlia knows a lot about dragons she might  be good to educate the troops also as grog mentioned we have people who could be very  valuable allies that your people have imprisoned it would behoove you to release them so that they  can join our side conversely any other type of magical enhancements that you can use to arm  against acid  laura acid  marisha for any and all of your troops its definitely suggested  matt ill talk to our speakers
