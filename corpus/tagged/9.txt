none	 all of matts toys where does he get these wonderful toys did it do it  sam yeah theres music  liam it did it on the edges of the cyrengreen forest not too terribly far from the city of  deastok on the continent of wildemount stands lorelei castle home for many generations to the  lorelei family the lorelei bloodline stretches back almost three centuries but only rose to  prominence during the war between the dwendalian empire which we now reside within and the julous  dominion which once ruled the southern half of the marrow valley 
none	 in the preceding age the  loreleis proved their worth in that conflict and were gifted for their service with a stretch of  land that you five siblings were born and raised on it was also during the bloody struggles of  that long past war that the bloodline would be changed forever during a near fatal encounter  your ancestor alfarr lorelei was bitten near the end days of the war the curse of lycanthropy  burned its way into the blood of alfarr in a relentless fever that nearly drove him mad but he  did not 
dung	 bend to it he persisted as did his daughter and her sons and so on the familys  secret has been closely guarded over the centuries and in its earliest days the curse was  seen as just that a curse but with time came acceptance and the responsibility of power once  of age lorelei youths eventually undergo the taming of their wilder nature and their  animalistic blood and it has largely been responsible for the familys ascension over many a  generation some have faltered there have certainly been dark periods in the lorelei  history individuals 
none	 who let their baser impulses rule them but the family always returned to the  right and the good aurra  erica yes  liam lucius luseeus or lushus  tj luseeus  liam portia  laura hello  liam and the twins benicio and lawrence  sam bro  travis whats up brother  liam you know a little of this struggle yourselves at least you hear tell from your  father i love this game  travis so much  liam at least you hear tell from your father and your great aunt katerine your father haldur  
none	 lorelei never knew his own mother genevieve lorelei but by his aunt katerines account she  was unbridled and wild spurned the taming embraced the animal within more than the family  would have liked it led to her doom they would say it was that very nature that drew her into a  whirlwind romance with a man the family did not approve of haldur or hal was born out of  wedlock and never knew his mother she was murdered not far from the castle grounds and found  in a wolven heap her father was dead or 
none	 fled or possibly killed genevieve the family theorized  anyway the only mother hal knew was aunt katerine who loved her sisters son with all her  heart raised him well led him through the taming made him the kind and just nobleman he is  today sadly history repeats and repeats and katerine is mostly the only mother you five have  known either when your mother rosalind died during the birth of the twins old though she was  katerine dutifully continued her role as the family matriarch aurra you as the oldest and  you lucius two 
tavern	 years aurras junior you both remember rosalind some but for all of you it has  been old aunt kat who sat by your beds as children who taught you your letters and how haldur and  katerine love you youve grown into your adulthood with grace and strength and absorb the  lessons of your forebears to an extent aurra you were meant to rule this house after your  father is someday gone but like your grandmother genevieve and others with that wilder streak in  the familys history you have eschewed the taming in fact much to 
none	 your fathers heartache  you have chosen instead to wander the wilds forsaking civilized nobility entirely he loves  you and you love him but its been complicated lucius in a similar vein you too have chosen a  path outside of the loreleis elder traditions you were but a child when you heard the voice of  the moonweaver whispering to you by the light of the full moon you soon began praying to her  nightly when you were old enough to make up your own mind you followed her voice to the temple and  found your 
none	 second family it was really portia accomplished and driven portia who first fit the  mold of the lorelei noble you excelled at everything demanded to undergo the taming two  years early and while you love your older siblings dearly you know if they have no desire  to rule you will gladly assume that seat of power then there are the twins our two burly  hulking twins  sam larry  liam studious and seriousminded larry lawrence really you underwent the taming as was expected  and youre prepared to offer what the family requires but your 
none	 true love is logic reason and  the study of this curse that runs through your familys blood perhaps it can be better  understood and better used for the good of house lorelei if anyone can do so it is you then  there is you benicio  sam yeah  liam slightly taller than your twin brother with none of the useless fixation on books you  couldnt wait to undergo the taming you had an itch for danger from an early age and were  impatient to enter your adult life and flex  sam fuck yeah 
none	  liam power it was this love of trouble actually that led you to burning your arms so  badly all those years ago all in an attempt to prank your twin by sabotaging one of his  explorations of alchemy lesson somewhat learned  sam fire bad  liam two weeks ago each of you received identical letters from your father haldur  summoning you home to castle lorelei intimated in those letters is his wish to discuss the familys  future and the handing down of power within the family you all have been spread to the winds 
none	 the  last six months to a year maybe following the individual threads that life has laid before you  now hal is eager to see his children all around him again as yet another token of his love he  has provided you all with three days and nights of rest recuperation and general pampering together  at one of the finest inns in deastok the shaded bough it is here that we begin this current verse  in the song of the lorelei you are gathered in the sumptuous dining room of the shaded bough  your breakfast 
none	 is finished your bags are packed bough  travis and laura boughwow  liam your horses have been prepped for your departure and it is raining  travis i need to hear that shit  liam yeah so do i where is it where is it matthew  travis drop me in  liam drop a beat  travis should we shake the fucking water off oh were people  liam the morning is yours it is about a days journey home to castle lorelei you have a way you  go we have a shortcut that will get you 
none	 there before sun is down but it does not look as much  fun as you expected it to be with the heavy rain  travis are we inside  liam yeah you just finished your breakfast in a very fancy dining hall  sam have we seen each other in a while all together  liam you spent the last three days getting facials steaming catching up  travis after all brother and sister did need to have their fleas removed from so much time outside  sam good one bro  travis thanks  erica truly  travis 
none	 sorry  sam youve been gone so long  erica i have  sam do you feel like youre better than us now  erica i feel im aware of things other than you are  sam so yeah you think youre better than us  erica you can put it however youd like brother  sam well see about that  liam i would like to thank whatever videogame company screamed you hoarse to make you sound so deep  travis you sound ragged and sexy as eff  sam this is my normal voice i do a voice 
town	 for the other 130 episodes that weve done  liam well if theres any business you want to see to you can certainly can but we could also  hit the road if youd like  erica would anyone like to step out into the rains  laura the path will be covered with mud  erica doesnt that make it better  travis and laura does it  erica i remember why i stayed away  travis i have no objections to getting started i suppose the sooner the better right brother  tj of course let us begin 
town	  laughter  liam hoods up into the rain you leave the shaded bough mount up and ride out of the larger  city of deastok its slow going the visibility is low the rain is pouring in sheets but you are  taking the same path you always have when traveling between deastok and your home the  quickest route there is following the main road for three or four hours theres a particular  field that youre all familiar with which if you cut across there is a stream there a small river  wispern river which you 
none	 cut over and you can get home by the end of day if thats the way you want  to take or you can take the long way which i dont know why you would  laura well the stream will be flooded with all this rain  erica i say we take the long way  laura laughing just to fuck with our dm  tj before having left i spoke with the small folk i want to know what is going on in the  nearby lands is there any trouble  liam there is a great deal 
none	 of trouble not in these parts were more towards the east in  wildemount but to the west there is mounting confrontation with the country of xhorhas all the  military forces have been sent in that direction rumors hey man i dont know what matts  planning so lets keep it vague shall we but word has gotten back to you not generally known  but to you lucius that its not been going well on the front  tj and in this land no bandits or anything  liam no there is definitely hiring of there is a 
town	 criminal element in deastok and you do keep tabs  on it but nothing no bump certainly that would alarm you  tj very well we proceed on the long road  erica thank you brother  liam okay so portia wisely avoids the wispern river anticipating possible flooding so its  going to be a long journey it will take the better part of the day you might not make it by  sundown this time in fact in the interest of time well say that you ride all day in the wain  liam and laura in da 
none	 wain  liam mawwaige  travis singing im widing in the wain  liam singing werewolves in the wain speaking see were very serious here you spend most of  the day riding and getting sopping wet and miserable and you are looking forward very much to  seeing all of the familiar faces who work in the castle the cooks the people in the stable all  the familiar faces and catching up with your father you maybe are a little anxious about  seeing him for the first time in a while but still the sun does eventually 
dung	 set and you ride  for a bit in the dark you do have in your belongings some hooded lanterns which is lucky  because thats the only thing that would stay lit in weather like this castle lorelei is built on a  tall hill a ways from the road on the edge of the cyrengreen forest so youve spent a lot of your  youth poking into those woods and getting into trouble you especially nostalgia always hits  when you return but something is off this time returning home at night which youve done  before this 
dung	 is not the first but coming around a bend about a mile away from lorelei castle youre  used to seeing lights twinkling on the horizon few fires and torches in various places in the  castle but you dont see any of that today it is pouring rain it is very dark out and youre a  little bumped a mile out from home  laura why isnt the castle lit up  sam well maybe theyre trying to conserve torch light or something  travis dont be an idiot thats not a real thing  sam torches are 
none	 expensive  laura theyre not expensive  travis i too am concerned  erica i sense wariness among the woodland creatures  sam what okay  laughter  laura any time father knows were coming he makes the castle ready this is strange  sam ooh is it a surprise party  laura possible  sam luci its close to your birthday isnt it  liam luci only you notice as you draw even a little bit nearer that the gates to the castle are  open as well  tj the gates are open this is not normal fathers 
dung	 fastidious about the gates the house  and especially if we were coming everything would be lit  travis i agree cause for concern  laura i think we should enter the castle warily off of the horses  sam you guys are a bunch of nambypambies  laura you want to ride in there benny  sam well i mean im not going to its dark  erica i will produce a flame  sam all right then ill  liam youre doing it youre doing it  travis youre doing it peter  laura oh my god theres 
none	 a flame in your hand right now  sam you want to come in the front way with me  erica of course  laura the castles overrun youre just going to get attacked do you think theres not a good  reason all the flames are out  travis caution may be the wiser choice here brother  sam sighs fine  erica i will put it out  laura is there a side entrance theres a side entrance we all know about it  liam there are multiple entrances to the castle theres one at the back theres 
none	 one on each side  in fact  laura whispering the side entrance  sam all right were all going in the side entrance then  tj which way did we sneak in and out of the castle as children  liam on the back side of the castle facing towards the woods and the family cemetery  grounds and the fields you played in  tj aurra do you remember the way that we used to sneak in through the back  erica i do brother  tj perhaps this is a wise way to enter  laura its 
dung	 a pretty small tunnel benny you might not fit now youre so big  sam ill make some space  travis yay more going through the woods my favorite lets go  liam you guys loop around in the dark  tj leave the horses behind  laura stealthily well do it quietly so no one notices us  travis we kill the horses before we laughing snarling not yet not yet  sam not yet wait for it  laura dont let him transform the whole game make sure you never let him transform  liam okay  travis 
dung	 i wait i tie mine to a tree though so i know where my snack is  liam you guys do in the dark make your way around do you want to leave the lanterns lit or  are we going to go in total  laura how good is our vision  travis well these two people are quite familiar with the woods and that of nature i would not  mind letting them go first  liam the woods are a half mile out from the back of the keep  tj our lanterns are hooded we can 
none	 control the light we proceed carefully  liam everybody make a stealth check  travis ooh first roll  sam wrong one you want to roll the big one  erica holding the big one thank you for moving those appreciate it wait what am i tracking  stealth thank you oh that is bad thats real bad im going to go with a five im a five  liam great whatd everybody get  travis 13  sam 21  laura 14  tj i seem to have tripped  laura did you get a one  liam did 
none	 you  tj six  liam oh six okay you guys are traveling along the outer wall and lucius is trailing behind and  you do hear metal scraping against stone for a split second  travis what is that  tj im fine nothing  travis is that a belt what is it how much metal do you have on you  tj its the lantern i dropped it  erica its all right you found our way  sam do you need to make some sort of prayer or something before we go in there  tj the 
none	 moonweaver guides me  sam could you tell her to guide you a little better burn some incense man come on lets go  liam arguing you eventually make it around back and you do find the one single small door that is  on the back side of the keep it also can be fired at from above but no ones doing that it is also  barred from the inside  travis barred from the inside  liam youd know because you live here obviously  travis right are there any signs of struggle or debris arrows staffs 
dung	  liam make an investigation check look at that its that easy you just make it up  travis 14  liam no nothing seems amiss it is dark maybe youre missing something but it looks like the  same old door in the same spot that you would run out in the middle of the night  travis no signs of struggle strange they wouldnt be anticipating our arrival  sam because theres no one here you guys are freaking out over nothing they turned off the lights  erica then who barred the door  travis exactly how 
none	 many times has no one been here  tj our father has invited us the entire family yes when has he ever missed an opportunity to  hold a social gathering without all the frills this place should be lit and filled with cooks and  bakers and smells of love and yet it is cold  laura smells of love you heard him smells of love  sam yeah yeah he always had the nice flowery  erica should i produce a flame again  sam if you must we cant get into this tunnel weve gone in our 
none	 whole lives  liam youd opened it from the inside and leave it thats what youve always done is left a crack  sam oh its locked  liam yeah its not a squeaking its a thudding  laura how old is the door can we bust through the bottom part of the wood or something  liam you can certainly try  laura should i try  travis are you strong  laura i am so fucking strong  liam you are pretty strong  laura im going to try it im going to try and just through the 
none	 bottom  travis ill help you you get advantage if the dm allows it  laura if you want me to have advantage do you want me to have advantage because hes helping me  liam how are you doing this  laura is it a wooden door  liam yes it is heavy wooden door  travis heel kick that shit  laura yeah at the bottom im going to aim below where the barricade is im going to try to make a  tunnel at the bottom of it you know what i mean  erica are you 
none	 aiming for a specific location  laura the bottom center where its the weakest  erica should i illuminate your effort  laura do i see a weak spot where the wood i mean its pretty old theres a tunnel is there  rotted wood anywhere  liam one slat is a little mangier than the others  laura i want to aim for that  liam you can have advantage because your brother and sister offered to kick that shit with you  tj i give her a prayer of guidance without her knowledge to the moonweaver of course 
dung	 d4  travis singing ooh moonweaver  sam what are you doing over there you praying what are you doing over there what is that  tj the moonweaver will see us through  laura jesus h its fine what do i do add my strength modifier 20 wait 11 plus seven 18  liam you do slam your foot as hard as you can into that door and it does break it pushes in  about this far and it is dark in there but there is now about this wide a gap so if you can shrink  
none	 a lot  laura all of the rest of the slats just really try to  travis how does it smell  liam it actually smells terrible it smells nauseating  laura does it smell sweet does it smell like death  liam yes  sam like death  laura it smells like death in there  liam you do smell the smell of a heavily ripe rotting body  laura really try to bust through  sam its probably just a rat or something you know those ran down here all the time  liam also lucius you know 
none	 where you are this room which used to be a meeting hall when you  were inducted into the temple of the moonweaver your father as a gift to you had it altered and  turned into a chapel in honor of the moonweaver for whenever you visited  tj we need to get inside  laura will you stick your flame hand through the door  erica of course  laura what can we see does it look like a lot of bodies in there  liam you can see about six feet in from the angle that the 
none	 wood is in its still blocking  your way and you cant get your noggin through that gap but you do see two legs and an arm and a  stone with congealed blood on the ground  laura two legs and an arm of the same body  liam no they look like three separate bodies  travis i was going to ask if the limbs were attached to anything but i take it theyre all separate  liam you see up to a shoulder on one and the other one you just see the ends  sam all 
none	 right im still not a hundred percent sure that this isnt some crazy surprise party or something  travis really  erica benicio  sam i dont know maybe i was wrong  erica do you smell that  sam yeah that could be hors doeuvres  tj we need to get inside  sam how thoughts  tj break this the rest of the way do what you need to do  sam ill take it give me a crack  tj guidance  liam excellent  sam growls ill take my glaive and grunting  liam okay make 
none	 an attack roll on that door  travis can you do it while be electrocuted and on fire  liam did you roll higher than a five  sam 21  liam you hit it roll for damage  travis these doors dont fuck with the loreleis  sam 11 points of damage  liam oh man the door breaks one hinge busts inward you now have a one foot view its still  connected at one hinge and didnt come off it would be hard to climb up and over into the gap  but youre looking in its 
none	 a pile of bodies its about 15 bodies piled in the middle of a chapel  devoted to the moonweaver  sam going to need some light in here  travis normally the castle is approximately how many stories is this an underground level  liam this is ground level there is an underground level and it is three stories  travis three stories got it were on ground level  laura do we recognize any of the bodies  liam yes you do you see one of the cooks a woman named estelle you see the stable master and 
none	  his eight year old son you see two of the guards the others you dont recognize per se  erica i will illuminate the room  laura look for father  liam make an investigation check  travis no  sam can i look at some of the bodies and see if i can discern the method of death be it burning or  slashing or strangling  liam absolutely perception check the door has not been broken free so you can look in its  hanging on a diagonal angle it probably wouldnt take much more to take 
none	 it away  sam 14 to look in  liam they are all slashed to shit  laura 14 for finding dad too  liam 14 for finding dad you do not see your father  travis were still outside  laura im going to shoulder  travis just a moment in case someone was anticipating us arriving there could be a trap  tj i grab two rocks and i pray for light and i throw them into the room at different angles so i  can see inside is there anything moving  liam no nothing is moving 
none	 and the door on the far side of the chapel which leads into the  courtyard inside the castle walls is closed you have very much illuminated the wretched pile of  lost souls in the center pews have been pushed to the side and theyre in a heap in a mound in the  middle of the room  tj break it down we need to get in  sam all right grunting punch the door  liam i will say that door comes right off the hinges  sam even though i rolled a two  laura to 
none	 hit it you rolled a two to hit it  sam i did its plus six so thats eight  liam in that case the door comes right off the hinges clatters down onto the ground and youre  now standing on top of it  tj i rush in i see if theres anyone that i can help anyone whos still alive  liam make an investigation check  laura ooh hes got a tower  liam hes been playing for 30 years  sam how come none of us ever used a tower in this game  laura 
none	 i dont know but it looks so cool now i want one  tj 18  liam what did i just say perception  tj investigation my perception is way better  liam they seem like they have been dead a while in fact follow that up with a medicine check  tj 15  liam you bend down by the body of the cook a woman who has cooked many meals for you and you  check the body and study the blood on the ground and how hard it is and you can tell that it has  
none	 been somewhere between i dont know two weeks a month maybe these bodies have been here a while  tj is my father in here  liam no hes not you push over a few bodies you spend five minutes sorting through the dead  and theyre all  tj these are dead and although they brought us up we must find our father  laura did you say how long theyve been here  tj days longer perhaps i start to go upstairs to where he would be  liam theres no upstairs here within the wall are rooms 
none	 on the ground level there is this  chapel theres a great meeting hall where your father receives people there are the kitchens  there are the stables the courtyard is huge and the entire thing is empty in the middle its  where youve trained and where youve played you would get there by exiting the door on the  opposite side of the room  travis someone will pay for this but can we please gagging open the other door  sam are you going to barf  travis no im not i have allergies  sam you 
town	 sure because theres blood and guts and brain all over the place  liam i should add its only the towers of the castle for the watch and the central keep that  is three stories tall the rest of it is low buildings  tj are there any shields or armaments on the walls  liam in here there is only a single shield  tj i grab it  liam okay it has the two arrows with the crescent moon in the middle that is symbol of the  moonweaver upon it  tj i was too small 
none	 to wield this when i was a child but now i will show my father different  and i grab it and i leave  liam okay lucius pushes past you all opens the door  laura wait lucius arm yourself everyone arm yourself  liam lucius by the dim light of the rocks that you illuminated in the chapel you can see a little  bit out here the first thing you see walking into the courtyard it is mostly empty what you can  see is a pile of weapons in the center of the courtyard piled up 
dung	 there seems to be a cart on  the far end but its very dark so you cant make much of it  tj light  liam okay its still a ways off its about 100 150 feet away but there is a cart full of  vegetables half unloaded you cant tell quite what they are from here  tj i yell to the others what i see on the inside and i wait  sam dont go any further wait until we come up with some kind of plan or something man  travis its a cart full 
none	 of vegetables what kind of plan do you need  tj our father might be in danger we must move quickly  laura does it look like the bodies were dragged into the temple or does it look like they were  murdered inside the temple  liam make an investigation check  travis ooh good question  laura 15  liam there is the residue and trails of blood leading from the courtyard you cant see it in  the mud in the courtyard because its raining so heavily ill add that its still raining is it  still 
none	 raining  travis yeah i hear it  liam you do i cant tell from here on the threshold leading in you see trails of blood that  are getting washed away by the torrential downpour  laura the rain of course gets rid of the tracks  travis do we care to visit the pile of weapons everyone have what they need in case you know  someone needs to be dealt with  sam i brought one with me if you guys need to stock up ill watch your backs  travis im good i pull out two 
none	 shortswords from my back harness underneath my jacket  liam excellent  erica i think i smell father  sam do the woodland creatures tell you where he is  erica no ive spent many years in the woods my senses are far more highly attuned than yours  sam all right i get it you dont like that i dont have a career  erica is that what im saying  sam i dont know youre always ragging on me to finish school and make something of myself  erica benicio i am simply speaking of your wolf  
none	 sam i get it  travis i wonder if maybe this is not the time to bring up old shit  sam i just dont want to be a craftsman  erica i smell father is that not important to you  sam yes it is lets go  laura where do you smell him  erica coming from that direction  liam from your vantage point to help you see the thing youve known all your life youre  standing with the chapel at your back and on your right is the keep your home your old bedrooms

dung	 laura awesome  liam you exit out the back of the keep and it is dark out although you are starting to get  occasional wisps of the moon almost full appearing as the clouds break and then cover  again to get to the family crypts they were built into a cave system discovered hundreds of  years ago and that you follow along the treeline about a quarter mile in that direction it wraps  around and that leads you to a mausoleum whats the other word sepulcher  travis yeah like a domed entrance to the  
none	 liam its a small building that serves as an entrance to the greater crypts below we set off  in that direction i assume  travis mmhmm  liam are we marching merrily along are we doing anything special  laura are we trying to be sneaky  travis fuck that  laura they know were here they know were coming  travis going to carve them  erica do you feel the moon  travis yes  tj i always feel the moon  travis i admit i feel a little its not as strong an urge but yes 
none	 some  liam this conversation happens as you trudge through the tall grass behind the keep  tj the final bit though we cannot approach from the front several people it took to kill an  entire castle of our friends and family if theyre waiting for us they will expect it from  the front no doubt  travis he speaks true  laura should we split up and enter from both sides  tj we should never split up  erica i agree  tj this is what caused this unfortunately we should come around from the side 
none	 i think  liam okay you know intimately what it looks like it is a low wall surrounds the entire  cemetery and its broken its old so the wall is fragmented and easy to enter from any side  really theres a wroughtiron fence that is aging and decrepit but that also surrounds the  mausoleum itself many generations are buried both in the grounds and below  liam alfarr the first wolf is buried within but you could potentially enter from any of the  four sides to get to the rear you would probably have to cut 
none	 into the woods and then pop back out  again but thats possible  tj i would like to suggest that to the group she can guide us through the woods best and we can  have a look to see if theres anything waiting for us  travis im already covered in muck no objections  erica i would be more comfortable as my wolf self  sam you want to turn now  erica the moon is full brother  sam well yeah but you dont have to i mean youre pretty scary when youre a wolf  
none	 erica not a full wolf brother  sam all right well maybe not yet  laura im not doing it  travis do it sister set the tone  erica thank you i become a werewolf  travis yeah sorry  liam you watch as aurra pops her shoulders and twists her neck and you see her grow a full two or  three inches and her shoulders widen and that very familiar prickle of fur which starts like needles  but then pushes out and becomes thick do me a favor erica what is the pattern of fur  
none	 erica gray with white  liam she stands there her breath floating in the air its cold now after the rain youre seeing  her breath in great heaves in the air  sam havent seen that in a while  tj she has mastered the gift it is effortless and graceful moonweaver bless you  erica thank you brother  sam ill guess youll lead the way then  liam so through the woods to the back  sam is that where were going  erica to the back  liam well you can approach its open almost from 
none	 all sides so there is definitely an entrance  erica yes through the woods  sam lawrence i think the moon is affecting you your hands are already turning  travis what  sam i slap his hand into his face when he looks down at it  liam you know that in times of great traumatic pain benicio has always sought solace in slap dick humor  travis well played brother  erica dont resist it  liam into the woods you go i dont require any rolls for this to find the way because youve  done it 
none	 many times you lead your siblings through the woods in an arc and take about 20 minutes to  reach a point where you know if you then veer back to your right and out of the woods you will be  will be about a hundred yards away from the cemetery grounds  tj were here solely to first gain information about our enemy and to see if they lie in wait for us  laura so we should move stealthily  tj i should not lead the way  erica i will go on all fours  travis 
none	 indeed  tj ill hang back and allow them but ill keep looking  liam so were stealthing in are you hanging back lucius  tj i hang back a healthy distance while i can still see them because im not good at dexterous  liam well how far back are we saying  tj 15 20 30 feet whatever is comfortable  liam so ill say everyone make a straight stealth check  tj i pray for my stealth check  laura shit  erica great im a two  sam well she had a natural one  liam

none	 see that low wall ahead of you and the rear wall of the mausoleum where the  ceremonial entrance to the crypts you dont see anything from back here and the main cemetery  grounds are in front of the structure are we going to creep up to the wall  erica were going to climb the wall  sam climb the wall  erica were going to climb the wall  tj how high is this wall  liam the wall is only five feet and its broken in places you can just walk through  laura as they 
none	 climb it i walk around it  erica i attempt to climb the wall and dislodge a stone in my stealth  liam so you scrabble up claw your way up  erica all fours  liam portia strides in regally alongside you  laura really  liam youre now standing at the very rear side of this stone small building not much bigger than  the space that were all in right now in this studio you dont hear anything you dont see  anything what do you want to do here  travis does your keen nose sense 
none	 anything  laura can you smell father  erica no but i smell that satchel  liam make a perception check at advantage  laura ooh that means roll it twice  erica is that  laura thats a nine  erica thats a nine  liam at advantage so roll again  sam do it again and take the better number  laura ooh much better  erica 16  laura plus  erica plus  sam other things  laura perception  erica perception is counting  laura whoa 23  erica thank you jesus wow  liam

none	 flickering light being reflected from some source that youre not able to see on the cemetery which  has been abused you see headstones pushed over you see piles of mud you see cloth or canvas  tarps lying about in great puddles its a mess  laura is someone camping in our cemetery  travis yeah i go and inspect one of the canvas tarps  liam theyre further towards the entrance  travis i dont mind  tj you said thats where light is coming from  liam no if this were the building right here and im 
none	 you guys initially coming around the side you  would see the light reflecting off of things over there so its here but out of view  tj there is light directly in front of the building that we cannot see the source  liam that you cant see the source right  erica flame light  liam it looks like it the light is shifting yeah  tj listen  liam you hear just the gentle crackle of fire  erica im on my legs again just for the record  tj so we smell smoke  liam make

none	 the sign perhaps  sam now we dont smell anything yet do we  laura do we see the light  liam have you turned the corner  laura have we i mean we saw the dancing reflection  travis we moved to turn the corner  laura stealthily  liam you move to turn the corner theres a giant wooden door that is closed here locked for all  time unless fathers bringing you here for visits but that door apparently is wide open and you  still cant see the source but the flickering lights coming from inside 
none	  laura can we creep up to the edge of the door i want to see if i can see a reflection in my sword  you know if i stick  liam so youre going to  laura use it like a mirror you know  liam yeah i know exactly what you mean as you stand there and hold your fathers blade out to  try to catch the light you hear a sound from behind you from two places the sound of fabric  and you hear and this is happening in a second metal banging off

none	 and you feel it  travis perhaps its time for us to continue below yes  tj say a short prayer to the moonweaver and ill pray for her and give her guidance  laura for what  tj i dont know youll have it for about a minute once we start moving for checks  erica can we speak to the goddess of the wilderness as well what  sam what are you going to say what do you need  erica her aid  sam oh yeah  tj couldnt hurt  liam are we progressing  laura 
dung	 lets move forward  liam okay who wants to lead the way  sam ill lead the way  travis ill join my twin  sam before we go down there im going to cast the rite of the flame on my glaive because the  short rest has lost that  liam thats right professor frink voice on my glaive  sam professor frink voice to glaive  liam lawrence was the only one who saw this before once you descend these marble stairs down  to the crypt its dark youre still getting the light of the fire 
dung	 above you but that trickles to  nothing in about 30 or 40 feet  tj i will pray for light on anything that you want if you have a shield or a weapon that you  would like  travis yeah ill pull out both shortswords and say  liam it glows in the dark and the twins lead the way down this hall youve been here many times  youve seen these likenesses of people long since past some in this century but the deeper you go  the longer back it goes you reach that bend and 
none	 turn to the right and as soon as you turn  something is off because you have been here at night even sneaking out of the back entrance of  the keep stealing your fathers key on a lark it is always pitch black down here but right now at  the far end where you know there is a dead end is light flickering in where the wall is its  hard to tell youre a good 150 feet away from it right now  erica do you see that light  sam yeah  travis if this elf 
dung	 is worth anything hes laid some traps before us i certainly would  sam you want to go first and check for them or do you want me to do my thing  travis by all means  laura how far away is it  travis 150 feet  erica may i cast faerie fire  liam right here where you are  erica into the darkness  liam into the dark you can absolutely with the intention to what light up the hall  erica light up whatever objects are in our path  liam currently you can see 
none	 from the light of his blades that the hall is clear and light gets  dimmer and dimmer and dimmer but you see some flickering at the wall far in the distance  nothings blocking your way  erica okay got it im going to hold that then  tj i will take out a copper piece and pray for light on it and throw it as far as i can comfortably  liam interesting okay you throw it about 40 feet and it strikes the stone and you hear it go  tinging you watch as that little light 
none	 slides down the hall it makes it about halfway there  its strange you know at the end of this hallway is where again alfarr the first of the wolves  and his daughter grenya the first to be born a wolf thats where their bodies rest in shrines to  each of them monuments i should say your father and aunt kat before your time created a small  altar at the end of this hall for genevieve its the family not secret but shame the family was  ashamed of genevieve and her leanings and her choices in 
dung	 life and her ferocity they worried  that she would let the secret out that generation above katerine they were very rigid and they  sealed her away again these crypts were built within an already existing cave system that was  utilized and built out your father told you a couple of times it pained both hal and kat but  genevieve was laid to rest within a cave and sealed inside never to be seen or to be spoken  of where that altar to your grandmother has always been there is clutter on the ground and  
none	 there is a hole  erica so she was entombed alive  liam no she was killed outside of the castle grounds  laura we dont know who did it  erica by perhaps her husband or no  liam youve heard a couple of theories kat was always very reluctant to speak of it it made her  very sad the subject  sam but theres a hole in front of her crypt tomb  liam it wasnt even a crypt it was just a small statue in her likeness and a small step that hal  would leave 
none	 flowers on theres rubble there right now  travis enough of this i walk forward  sam lawrence  liam you stride down the hallway your siblings watching as you go  laura i follow  sam im following as fast as i can  erica whats your intention  laura were going into the tunnels  liam it becomes easier to see the statue of genevieve is in three separate pieces on the  ground and as you come up by the light of the coin behind you and your own sword overtaking it  you see two large 
town	 black iron hammers lying on the ground here you see what you remember as  being a very smooth wall of stone ruptured with rubble lying around and its not wide but a  crack leading through this is something you have never seen before  travis so a dead end no longer  liam correct  travis whoa i figured as much our road does not end here blood on the floor any signs of struggle  liam make an investigation check  travis thats 18  liam you take that blade and spend five minutes carefully checking that 
none	 hole as you go but  looking along the ground you dont see any blood you dont see signs of anything other than the  destruction of the stone in front of you and the desecration of your familys most hallowed ground  laura aurra  erica yes sister  laura can you smell him  liam make a perception check with advantage  laura wait roll again  erica oh roll it again at advantage thank you  sam thats good  erica 16  laura but the other one was higher so it was 12 plus  erica 
none	 was it 12 thank you plus seven 19  liam you sniff through your canine snout you dont smell anything but your ear finely tuned  listens and listens and you do hear shallow breathing  sam from where  laura do you smell him  erica breathing i hear breathing i do not smell him  liam deep ahead  sam that way  erica that way  sam im going running noises  liam going in  sam yeah  liam sneaking in or storming in  sam no just storming  laura yeah going off to find

none	 dont know is it close if we can hear them breathing theyre close i just dont want  to waste it  erica you folks have always been afraid of your darkness  liam the way beyond  laura i go im going to go wolf  liam youre going wolf okay so your arms your shoulders your biceps swell you start to reach  the size of the twins and pass it just a little bit why dont you tell us how you look in your  wolven form  laura okay i resemble the way my hair is 
none	 so im all black fur on top and my underside is all  stark white kind of like a reverse skunk yeah  liam still holding that blade in your hands stalking forward  laura yeah and im clutching his ring around my neck it has a long chain so its not strangling  me or anything  liam got it got it okay so two wolves three men  tj who has that elven blade  travis oh i do  tj is it in your hand  travis i just have it like in my belt would you 
none	 like to see it  tj can i see it  travis yes of course  tj i can read elven what does this say  liam the dagger that was found inside  sam message or something what was it  liam silent message  laura kind of like a whisper  tj is this an elven blade  liam yeah its got elven language carved on it well it has elven language carved on it  tj silent message does that mean anything to me  liam make a history check  tj i pray  travis yeah 
none	  sam singing pray pray  tj 18  liam 18 youve heard a fair amount not as much as your brother youve read about  tj ill discuss this with him because hes smarter than i am  travis oh thank you  liam okay then roll again at advantage  laura he only thinks hes smarter than you  travis yes because i read  tj no its not as good  liam not as good youve read similar names in histories that touch on the nation of xhorhas  tj our enemy nation  laura ah  
none	 liam that is correct the country to the east  tj i mention this to everyone it doesnt strike any chords though beyond that  liam no  tj ill hand the thing back to you where did we find this blade  sam it was in aurras room it was in a bag it was no big deal  erica in this pouch with a familiar smell  sam guys youre making too much of it theres just some bad guys out there were going to kill  them then were going to have the party that i was 
none	 promised  erica too much of it  sam what huh  erica katerine was murdered our father has lost a hand and has been taken  tj the elves are an ancient people and they know magic well if this is true then they perhaps  know that this dagger is coming to them they know when and they know where perhaps  sam you want to get rid of it  tj i dont know we might need it  travis huh  liam so were pausing at this crack in the wall i assume  laura no 
dung	 were going in and were barging in  sam oh gosh shes freaking out  laura growling  liam its not that far what starts i lost my place here it starts out as structured  excavation you can tell that this was dug out at some point what lays beyond this cask of  amontilladotype wall but it quickly gives way to natural formations opening into a substantial  chamber ahead its a cave and there are two torches at the far end of it flickering the cave  bisects though not that far in front of you and 
none	 it seems to split as it opens up there is a  passage on your right but your eyes are more drawn very obviously very clearly to the far  end where those torches burn a tumble of stone leads up to a slightly higher ledge and you see a  figure standing there staring at you all as you enter  laura do we recognize him her them  liam make an insight check  tj can we do this as well  liam you can you both can  laura 13  tj 14  liam okay as 
dung	 you draw a little bit closer he is familiar he is familiar hes slender  youthfullooking dark almost bluehued skin of course sharp ears sharp expression the sides of  his head are shorn and there is a shock of white hair tied back he is staring at you and you  right now hes wearing dark oiled scale mail with a single chitinous pauldron on one shoulder  in his hand there is a cruellooking flail its jagged edges are currently trailing down and  wrapping around the neck of your father who is lying at his feet breathing

none	 you have been doing this for 30 years when i first started navigating moonbeam i  thought that when you cast it the damage happened immediately but ive seen a lot of debate about  this and what generally people say is that its when the moonbeam moves onto you or at the start  of your turn but not when you throw it on somebody else meaning you would dump the moonbeam  on grandma and then as soon as her turn started thats when the damage would take effect  tj i dont know why that would matter 
none	 one way or another for simplicity in bookkeeping  liam lets just do it now  tj its just easier  liam because her turn is so far away lets just nuke her  tj okay  liam she has to make a save it is  tj versus 15 save con  liam constitution  tj she doesnt look too healthy  liam she makes it  tj of course she does  liam rolled a 19 she takes half the damage is  tj 2d10  liam okay i got papers everywhere  tj 14 points of damage 
none	 full  liam okay  tj so half of that i dont know if this matters theres extra information first off shes hit by  the mark of waning because this is radiant damage so her speed is halved and she has disadvantage on  strength ability checks  liam cool  tj also a shapechanger makes a saving throw with disadvantage is she a shapechanger  liam i would say shes not anymore  tj okay  laura because shes stuck in that form  liam thats it yeah  sam whispering tjs notes are color coded  travis
