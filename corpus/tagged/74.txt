there friends let me ask you something chroma conclave got you down aw sure  it does thats a heavy scene man remember when things /none/ were simpler when the biggest threats  around were an eyeball under a mountain and a bohemian power couple sighs good times hey  what do you say we turn the clock back a bit welcome back to emon before the dragons came  anyone in the mood for a heist job okay lets go over what were doing tonight  everybody remember this gentleman spireling shenn yeah i like the look of this guy you  probably recall him attempting to reach a business arrangement between the clasp and vox machina in  the days after emon fell it /none/ didnt really pan out and thats okay hes always been a busy guy  has multiple irons in the fire on any given day and on this cold and rainy evening he simply  needs something retrieved for him something important only trouble is it belongs to someone  else someone whod rather not part with it  this is adelaide bluebutton better known as the shrew adelaide is a rather successful  businesswoman here in emon she buys and sells exotic curiosities from all the farflung corners  of the world mostly on the black market oh and shes /none/ really good at money laundering too which  the clasp would know theyve used her extensively in the past had a bit of a fallingout in recent  months though the clasp invited her to join them but adelaide wasnt interested and with her  business growing the way it was well the clasp prefers people they can control and by the way  if youre by any chance wondering how she came by the moniker the shrew she earned it bluebutton  is as mean a son of a bitch as you will ever meet a visiting merchant once /none/ tried to get the drop on  her and steal her wares she ripped his arms off without lifting a finger but a mark is a mark  and spireling shenn wants something specific earlier this year adelaide acquired an emerald as  big as a cantaloupe tagmuts eye priceless that is a substantial amount of capital that the clasp  could bend to its purposes thats where these guys come in  this is tarvis yes that is the name travis went with hes an assassin a good one tarvis is the  lead on one of shenns many /none/ teams here in emon hes also being groomed for more responsibility by  his higherups and is entirely devoted to his masters his instructions lead his team into  adelaide bluebuttons private residence find the gem and get the hell out of dodge simple  actually i should probably confess something here all of our players tonight theyve been  given secrets and they all think theyre the only ones tarviss secret the gem is actually a cover  shenn has given him specifically to keep the rest of his team from knowing the missions true  objective the shrews /none/ secret records shenn has told him to find a green leatherbound ledger  containing the name of every shady character the shrew has ever dealt with in emon including  traitors to the throne valuable information but according to shenn intelligence indicates that  the book will most likely be found in the womans basement or possibly in some sort of vault on the  second floor its not clear hes to find the book and keep it secret from his team sighs you  know what id better hurry this along weve got a house to break into  /none/ this fellow here is obby the rat hes quick with his hands and quicker with his mouth hes the  breakin guy hasnt met many locked doors that can slow him down obby has known tarvis for  years they used to play in the streets together as kids and tarvis saved him from enough  asskickings that he is fiercely loyal to the halforc loves that big guy also i gave him no  secrets just because i thought it would be funny  next we move on to delweth good with a blade knows a bit of magic /none/ just as easily kill you as  look at you shes pretty badass also just between you and me she secretly loathes tarvis  shes been with the clasp for years and is itching for advancement but instead of her they  fawn over the halforc instead so shes decided tonight is her chance to solve that problem  thats her secret once they secure this gem tarvis is a dead man hell probably the whole  team what happens at the shrews stays at the shrews and as far as the clasp will know they  all died doing /none/ what they loved  and this is dren she may be small but trust me she can wreck your day although lately shes  been doing a lot of babysitting see the team actually has an outsider in tow tonight someone  who knows adelaide and knows the house almost as well as the shrew does dren has been assigned to  guarding this turncoat for close to two months now the clasp has kept her under house arrest  and dren has been the one to bring her food keep her from bolting pass the time with her in /none/  fact probably too much time see she and her charge have fallen in love or lust you know  what its complicated but dren has revealed to her prisoner that despite their word the clasp  intends to kill her as soon as the job is done so the two have cooked up a plan once the emerald  has been secured they kill everyone take the gem and live happily ever after in another city  which just leaves us with devan devan is well a gambling addict mostly shes pretty good with  magic too but losing /none/ money is her real gift three months ago devan drunkenly shot her mouth  off at the wrong card table and boasted that she knew the shrew and whats more she knew the lay  of the old hags house like it was her own and she was even telling the truth see devan is the  shrews granddaughter well estranged granddaughter all right they hate each other  grandma adelaide once trained devan as she came to master the familys innate magical talents only  for a few years though when she was younger after the kids mother cut /town/ and ran but for some  reason it didnt end well and the old woman kicked her out on the street what can you do  well before she could blink the clasp had promptly bought up all her gambling debt and now  they have her under their thumb they gave her a choice guide tarviss team through her  grandmothers death trap of a house or take a dirt nap in the sewers now remember bringing dren  back into the story the two halfling lovers have hatched a plan once the gem is procured they  kill /town/ the others and run off into the sunset theres just one thing devan doesnt love dren  shes playing her once the others are down shes taking out dren grabbing the emerald and  splitting town on her own nothing personal  so there you have it thanks for tuning in tonight and welcome back to emon  laughter  liam welcome back i am very excited to share with you all what has cooked inside my head for  two weeks before we go i think it would be cool to really quick to clarify for the audience  /none/ could you all introduce yourselves your name your class your race thats racist  sam my mouth is full  liam we can start on this end  laura hi my name is devan bluebutton i spit as i said it im a halfling and im a sorcerer  ashly my names dren and i dont have a last name like prince and im an assassin and a  halfling  laughter  mary my name is delweth im a wood elf i have no last name like cher actually my last name is  cher is that it  /none/ liam sure  travis ive got naan in my teeth  mary thats his name naaninteeth  travis my name is tarvis  laughter  laura sounds like a lot of thought went into that  liam i texted travis about five times over a period of a week saying hey man you know give  me a name at some point so i can start crickets crickets crickets finally im like hey man  im going to go with tarvis yeah sounds good  laughter  travis brilliance inspiration incarnate and i am a halforc  mary whats your /none/ other half

we go  travis oh man  laura im so nervous  sam im nervous for liam because he has to be under a lot of pressure right now  liam liams nervous for liam too  for the last 24 hours the city of emon has been blanketed in the heaviest rains in recent memory  the streets have flooded with water and the /tavern/ few residents stubborn enough to brave the elements  hurry as quickly as they can to their destinations drenched and chilled to the bone  but not so for you four one of the clasps countless hidden cells youve been keeping warm  and cosy in the diamond nest tavern waiting for word from spireling shenn you already know the  task that awaits you youve been over it all that is left is for the spireling to set you  loose the diamond nest isnt horribly busy this evening but there are a few patrons scattered  about trying /none/ to warm themselves by the fire trying to warm themselves with drink youve been  here since the late afternoon hiding from the rain and tedium set in hours ago youve all been  pretending to nurse the same drinks since the sun went down and after minutes of staring at the  wall out of the corner of your eye delweth you notice the door to the kitchen swing quietly open  and a familiar figure come strolling over towards your table in the corner its garthok a lean  looking halforc youve run with a handful of times /town/ the rest of you finally notice him as well  as he slides up to the table evening friends  mary hello garthok  liam you all as bored as you look  mary pretty much  liam he looks towards the opaque windows facing out on the street the sound of heavy rain  spattering against them id hate to be the poor schmucks wandering around out there tonight  chuckles he looks back to you stares you dead in the eye hes waiting and with that the  halforc heads across the tavern and seats himself at the /tavern/ bar over the next few minutes starting  with dren you leave one at a time slip through the kitchen down into the secret passageway that  leads to the clasps headquarters below the diamond nest and dren while you wait for the  rest to catch up with you you make your way down a long hall nod at one of your brethren standing  watching at a door he unlocks it for you past the door reveals your charge devan lying on a  bed who sits up and looks at you  ashly hi giggles hi devan /dung/  laura whats going on out there  ashly oh were very bored  laura oh okay  ashly yeah  laura have you heard anything from shenn  ashly no mostly everyones been drinking there was a halforc whos a little scary and i wanted  to see do you need anything do you need like food or water or  laura oh youre so kind i think if you brought me anything they might catch on though  ashly oh right okay i worry about you you know alone in the dark  laura i worry about you /none/ too i think the sooner that we can get to the house the sooner we can end  all this  ashly thats true okay i wrote a haiku for you do you want to hear it  laura i would love to  ashly okay whats your last name again  liam should i pull up a chair for this and watch i could get some popcorn  ashly oh silence prisoner hi sorry  laura ow it hurt when you hit me a second ago  ashly hi i was checkingwhohow are  liam you know the spireling /none/ is waiting for you right  ashly oh ill go right now to go dont you go anywhere  laura scared sound  ashly oh yeah you better be scared yeah im going im gone  liam bring the girl  ashly oh right i lock the door and  liam everybody else catches up you all gather outside of shens chamber to wait four members of  the clasp and this yutz after a while the door opens and another group of four files out heading  down the hallway you all came from and inside you see shen /none/ looking down at some parchment spread  out across his table his red monocle catching a bit of light from a lantern in the room yes  yes come in i know you all must have been going a bit stircrazy come right i had hoped to move  on this last night but im afraid the elder bluebutton delayed her departure for a day  however she has finally left for her little excursion in vasselheim weve had her trailed to  the city limits and beyond her house staff is still on the premises but they largely keep /none/ in  their separate lodgings for the night and even if one of them decides to poke about in the main  house im sure they wont be much of a problem any last questions before i send you out  sam exaggerated russian accent obby the rat has question  laughter  sam describe item again  liam all right i will its hard to miss its a gem the size of a skull an emerald as big as  your head sir  sam obby has big head  liam that you do tarvis do you have any /none/ real questions or are you good to go  travis oh im ready to roll whenever everyone else is  ashly im ready  mary yeah all right  liam he walks up to you tarvis and right up close to you takes a little latch on your armor  and tightens it and says now bring me my prize  travis of course spireling  liam i know you wont disappoint  travis never dream of it  liam he then walks over to you devan miss bluebutton i hope you will put your trust in our  very /none/ capable hands im sure with your guidance your grandmothers precautions will pose little  problem my people will keep you safe just do as your escorts say and theres no reason why things  should go any differently than our little test runs over the last couple weeks  laura okay  liam once tagmuts eye sits on this table you will be free of your debt as promised  laura thank you  liam im a good judge of character ive no doubt youll do fine go  laura now  liam you all leave the room make your /tavern/ way through the various halls of the clasp underneath  the tavern and you find the entrance to the tunnels that connect to the sewers the drainage  system underneath emon is vast and labrynthine but obby knows them well hes traveled through at  least half of it at this point sleeping below the streets of the city as much as he has above  bluebuttons home adelaide bluebutton your grandmother the shrew  laura she is a shrew  liam shes over in the central district its a ways off from the graveyard district where youre  starting /dung/ and even though the rat hasnt been down this stretch of tunnelwork before with maps  procured from city planning hes able to guide the party there without any trouble  sam i follow my nose  mary liam and sam it always knows  liam so most of you can see in the dark but the two halflings would be blind as a bat so devan  and obby are carrying torches to light the way theres also a lot of icky shit in the sewers so  better to be prepared and eventually you make your way to /none/ your destination which is a large  runoff from adelaides property you come up to a deadend on a side path in the sewers two equal  walkways on either side of a canal and there is a shawshanksize pipe coming out of the wall and  water is rushing out of it at a steady pace because it is raining cats and dogs outside  whispers ive got rain  all ooh  liam and this is the plan looking at the schematics here you know that the main pipe leads  to two smaller big enough for tarvis /none/ barely to shimmy up to two separate runoff drains on her  property so thats the plan it might be a little trickier than anticipated because of the rain but  you can certainly have at it  sam and we pick one or the other  liam well initially its one and then it splits  travis a few marching orders before we begin obby and i work together a lot so were familiar  with each other wouldnt you say  sam yes id follow you anywhere tarvis  travis anywhere  sam hes very smart  travis /none/ delweth ive been learning a little bit more about  mary yeah  travis dren not quite so sure what it is that you do  ashly well i guard devan our prisoner and on the side im a bit of a poet and i also assassin  people very well  travis good how do you like to assassin people  ashly stealthily usually  travis with your hands  ashly no i have like a crossbow type of situation going on  travis nice a little range action  ashly yeah yeah  travis delweth would you mind /none/ sharing with devan what exactly you do to people like her in case she  thinks about running off or leaving  laura im not going to run anywhere  travis no its a hypothetical deal youll enjoy this  mary starting at the head or at the feet  travis you know what dealers choice  mary really  sam obby prefers the feet  mary all right  travis this is violence not the other stuff  ashly is this really necessary shes being very wellbehaved  mary youre rather small so i cant really wear your skin /none/ as a suit but i could try maybe do  id like a skirt id probably make your skin into a  ashly hey guys maybe we should pick a way to go  travis that was lovely thank you for that  mary i could flay you alive  travis yeah thats really nice  sam tarvis  travis yes  sam even though this dren is guarding our prisoner we are all allowed to kill her if she  acts up correct  travis oh did i not mention that in the clasp yes if you betray one /none/ of your own we will turn  you inside out and wear you as a hat  mary oh all right a hats all right too  travis but dren knows that  ashly yeah i know that  travis you knew that already didnt you  ashly yeah yeah yeah  mary shes small too itd be a small hat but a nice one  ashly i wouldnt make a very good hat  travis does anyone have a preference marching order into the pipe  sam i will go first  travis really  sam yes let me /none/ tell you story you know why they call me obby the rat  travis i mean i do you want to tell them  sam because i am small like rat i go first  liam okay it is not easily walked into its about 15 feet above all your heads 17 feet above yours  sam i will climb up there will it be an easy climb or difficult climb  laughter  travis im going to die i wasnt ready for this  sam obby the rat is now realizing he must maintain accent for three hours  /none/ laughter  sam with very limited accent abilities  liam if youd like you can make an acrobatics check to get up to the pipe  sam hold my torch acrobatics ooh 22  liam yeah you are a spry youre skinnymini for a dwarf you scrabble up parkour off of one  corner and then leap out and manage to catch with your hand and hang from it  sam i look back down at them clicks tongue  liam and then you yank your butt up inside it is slick and slimy from plant matter that has gone /none/  through here and also there is water rushing in your face youre getting toileted on for the most  part here id also make a quick strength check to make sure you dont get flushed out  sam natural 20  all wow  laura already  liam like a cat you go up on the ends of your fingers and the ends of your toes and all the  water scoots out under you okay as he scrabbles up delweth you bored and not interested in the  dwarfs ass are staring at the wall and you notice /none/ off to the side a single brick maybe an  inch out of the wall its nothing major but it bumps you a little because the rest of the tunnel  is pretty level and clean  mary im going to kill the party in the first five minutes can i do a perception check  liam sure  mary 13  liam yeah without touching it you get a bit closer and can see that it is loose thats going  to slide right in and out  mary hmm  travis brick in the wall  mary yeah /none/ tarvis  liam well call that checking for traps as well you dont see anything hinky  travis yes dear  mary tarvis did you see this  travis i do  mary what do you think oh great leader  travis hmm you think its trapped  mary i do actually  travis maybe we should have dren touch it  mary yeah  ashly sure ill touch it  travis you will  ashly well once you guys are all up there what do we think it would be do we have to touch it  mary no /none/ we dont have to touch it  laura its not trapped  travis did you want to give it a touch oh  liam you pull and not one brick but four bricks all connected come out and uncover a flatter stone  surface inside and youre right up against it now and you see a very familiar circular insignia  there of a rodent curled in on itself in a little ball you know this this is your grandmothers sign  laura siggle  liam this is a house seal its a siggle  mary siggle  liam its /none/ the siggle of the shrew  laura gasp i wonder if it works the way it does upstairs  travis how does it work upstairs  laura i pull out my dagger and i cut my hand with it  sam whoa  laura and i stick it on there anything  liam yes you remember how this works it doesnt happen instantly but you feel the blood seep from  your hand into it it stings a little bit but its not too bad and after like 20 seconds  enough blood is pulled out and you hear a /none/ little click and the seal spins a quarter inch and the  door because its a door pushes a little bit in  ashly ha see yeah it wasnt a trap good job devan  laura thanks  travis good job devan  laura thanks  travis proving useful  laura i am useful also i cast dancing lights and throw my torch on the ground  liam okay rolls into the canal goes out floats away down in the rainwater  laura see guys  liam and four beautiful globes of light swirl around devan and light up and /none/ shadows sparkle all  around you its like a little disco  travis was that our only torch  liam in the sewer no obbys got one  mary no we have two  laura why do you need another torch  ashly so does the door open all the way or a little bit  liam i dont know  mary oi devan  laura huh  mary next time you think to throw something away check with us first please  laura okay but ive got lots of light though  mary im so glad  travis hat /none/ remember shell wear you as a hat  mary skirt actually yeah with pleats  travis could i check the partially open door  liam sure you want to check it for danger  travis i would like to check it for danger  liam sure make a danger check also known as perception  travis oh perception  sam not great  travis seven  liam it looks good i mean youd know if there was something wrong with this seems fine i mean  its a door right doors open and close  travis they sure do  /dung/ ashly can i check to see if i can fit through it  liam you can almost fit through it it catches on your armor a bit so youre through and it feels  cool and its dark in there you cant see shit in there  laura oh i send one of the dancing lights in with her  liam okay it floats in past and you looking through can see the light the tunnel curves to  the right and it goes around the corner and you see the light go whoosh also shimmying around  like this /none/ the door goes a little bit further and opens it almost feels like its on some sort of track or  rollers and it slides back a little bit further and follows you in a bit and theres actually a  way to step over to the right and go around and youre in  ashly im in guys  travis well keep it up well follow you  ashly can i borrow a torch or something  laura i send another dancing light in  ashly thanks devan  laura youre welcome  liam a little gold ball dancing /none/ around the top of your head right now  mary check the walls for a torch  ashly my perception is not great but should i roll  liam you can you dont see anything here  ashly i dont see anything here  liam its a plain flat smooth not curved but goes straight and then angles and then angles  again and you cant see around the corner  ashly okay so i could walk down  sam i stick my head out of the pipe and say i think it found where it splits into two im /none/  covered in mostly number ones a few number twos we can make it through here it will be very  difficult though where are you all  travis obby  sam what  travis we found a secret door  sam i can come down from the number one and number two place  travis we should leave him up there  mary you want to  travis no you can come down from the number one and number two place  sam all right tarvis i jump down  liam okay despite being covered in its not a /none/ lot of poo or anything  sam and ashly mostly number one  liam you land and do a nice little dwarven threepoint landing on one of the pathways and  now you three are standing there youre at the edge and youre inside  mary are there bricks around the door or do we need to  liam yeah you know that scene in labyrinth where shes running down that long brick passage  laura and the thing goes spinning  liam no the one where it keeps going forever and she cant find any doors its like that /none/ i mean  where the door was is uneven theres teeth of bricks sticking out the sides and the whole thing moved  in straight  laura so its a door  liam yeah it doesnt come out it goes in and dren was able to go whoop  mary does the door keep moving all the way down the hallway  liam i dont know  travis devan those dancing lights are awfully cute do you mind if i ask you how you came to be  in the service of the clasp  laura oh  liam let /none/ me rejigger your memory tarvis shes not in the clasp  travis no why youre indebted to the clasp  laura oh well yeah well so you know gambling huh  ashly i know gambling  laura how fun is that  ashly its so fun  travis dren  ashly sorry  laura but sometimes it gets you into trouble and sometimes you cant pay off all your bills and  sometimes your grandma has a lot of gold and some treasure and i said it and the clasp heard me and  now im stuck with you guys /none/ but im totally on board and im real excited to help you out and be  free of you at the same time  travis boy golly gosh that sounds so nice do me a favor gamble on your own time dont gamble  with our lives we work as a team here so those dancing lights down here are fine but you check  with dren or her or him before you do that again we clear  laura sure  travis good give obby a hug for checking out that dangerous pipe for you  mary hes covered /none/ in number one  sam its okay i am frequently used as punishment  ashly you get used to it  travis i would like to stealth into the doorway and moving forward be on the alert for traps  liam okay would everyone like to make a stealth check  mary yes  travis i dont normally stealth so thats a weird sentence for me  liam i know nor do you have an intelligence of 18 but its going really well  travis im trying not to speak as grog  sam 16  ashly 24  mary /none/ 26  travis 18  laura 17  liam 17 okay and yeah i would like a marching order so how are you guys going in  travis ill be first through the door  mary ill be last  sam ill be number two  laura ill be behind dren then  liam okay youve got a very scary elf behind you  laura yeah  liam yeah all right so very quietly even your gambling charge here slowly creep around the door  and curve around the side and it is pitch black in here you guys are /none/ fine you can see in low  light and pitch black its pitch black in here or it was and you see the tunnel stretch on  really far you can see maybe 40 or 50 or 60 feet ahead of you but it keeps going and goes whoosh  into black its a long tunnel and theres nothing its very nondescript  mary we still have one torch lit yeah  laura and three dancing balls of light can i ask a question  liam yeah  laura cantrips  liam yes  laura how many do i get /none/  sam all  laura i just can do them  liam all you want  laura this is amazing  liam you can make it rain with cantrips  mary seriously all day long all night  laura make it hail baby all right thats gold coins  sam as much as i dont want to rely on our prisoner this would be a good opportunity to  throw a light down the hallway  travis i suppose youre right obby maybe you should be the one to let her know that she can  sam obby says do /none/ magic trick  laura go down the hallway  sam thank you  liam a little ball swirls in a spiral down the hall and you watch this little circle like a  firefly go further and further  laura its 120 foot range  liam yeah it keeps going and then starts to dim and then you lose sight of it  laura come back  liam and you wanted to check for traps here right  travis yeah  liam make a perception check  travis 16  liam okay from where you are its a smooth flat /none/ tunnel its plain you guys want to move  forward  mary i pull out my rapier and hold it as we proceed  liam okay all right so you move forward in a little conga line down this tunnel and it takes  a while youre walking the sound of the rain once i adjust vanishes behind you come on  buddy there you go  laura as were walking can i make the four lights combine together in the shape of a human  all the way down at the end of the hallway  liam sure in /town/ a rough  laura yeah it makes a humanoid form yeah  liam like one of those plastic signs thats shaped like a person on the street saying like  dont walk here because youll slip  laura it says you can into a vaguely humanoid form  liam yeah thats vague  laura yeah  liam so yeah youve got a gingerbreadshaped light man  laura okay down at the end of the hallway  liam okay hes standing there like this and goes and you can see him you moved far enough  along youve probably gone about /none/ 100 feet at this point you can continue to walk on down or  mary tarvis how are the traps looking you seeing anything up front  travis nothing yet my dear  ashly do you guys want to hear a haiku i wrote  travis a haiku  ashly yeah  mary what the fuck is a haiku  ashly its like a poem  sam its a 757 meter poem  travis obby  ashly well 575  sam not where im from  travis sure dren wed love to hear one  ashly thanks tarvis wow i /none/ really didnt think you were going to go for that okay we walk down  a thing there is a bright man here too we are all much friends  sam you wrote that  ashly yeah  sam ahead of time  ashly yeah i worked on it really hard  mary how long  ashly couple hours  liam as youre having this little walkandtalk down the hallway tarvis you feel a little  click under your foot  travis dont move  mary what is it  travis i stepped on something that clicked  mary whos /none/ got the torch you do put it down by your feet what do you see  travis what do i see  liam you see one tile pushed diagonally down about a half inch in in a real odd way  travis real quick everybody check the walls ceilings floors see what this might unleash  liam everybody make a perception check  travis 18  ashly 13  laura four  mary 17  sam four  liam devan you no  mary 17  liam who got the 18 you got the 18 okay you guys both look /none/ everywhere look all around look  up and starting right above you tarvis and stretching about 20 feet along the roof of this  tunnel are maybe 100 tiny holes in the ceiling  laura is it behind us too or just in front of us  liam it starts above tarvis  travis the duration of the hallway  liam right where tarvis is right where he has stepped  laura we could back up we could just back up then  sam we hold devan above us as a human shield and keep running  laura thats not /none/ smart im the only one that can get you to the actual thing that you need  mary can i do a perception check to see how much weight pressure it would need to keep the tile down  liam make an investigation check  mary investigation check  laura while shes looking at it im going to send a message to  mary thats a natural one  laura to dren no one else can hear im going to say hey im thinking they might be catching  on to something so maybe it would be smart if we /none/ pretended that we didnt like each other a little  bit more than we have been  ashly i know im sorry im trying really hard i just like you a lot  laura i know i like you so much  ashly okay should i be meaner to you  laura yeah maybe a little mean so theyre not catching on as much  ashly okay lets use her as a human shield  laura oh no  tarvis wow dren that was really drastic  ashly yeah  tarvis okay would you like to hold her up  /none/ ashly sure okay  laura that was maybe a bit too much  travis maybe not dren i like your enthusiasm though  ashly thanks  travis yeah devan  laura yeah  travis you have some tricks about you right  laura yes i do  travis any favorite spells that you like to use  laura nothing thatll work on these things  travis the holes  laura holes on this trap i can try casting ray of frost on the tile and freeze it in place  sam thats pretty smart  laura i mean it might /none/ work i can try it  liam thats true it might work and you can try it  travis one could say you can certainly try  laura but tarvis in doing so i might actually hurt your foot but i dont want you to blame me  because im just doing it because im trying to freeze the thing  travis i appreciate your concern  mary well lets have a think for a moment right so its not behind us theres nothing in the  ceiling behind us its just ahead of us  liam you dont see /none/ anything behind  mary little holes  liam the holes stretch above tarvis for 15 or 20 feet  mary 15 or 20 feet all right  sam we could all go leaving tarvis here  mary well what i was thinking was what if i cast mage hand and pushed down on the tile you take a  step back and we see what happens and if it holds then we can move forward because the mage  hand will last for 30 feet and well be beyond the 20 feet of ceiling shite  laura thats really smart /none/  travis objections  ashly do we know that it only goes on for 20 more feet this tunnel  liam the tunnel goes for another i dont know 100 150 feet but the holes that they noticed  above tarvis and moving about stop after about 15 20 feet ahead  travis i like your idea devan  laura what  travis how about you use your ray of frost on the holes so that if anything decides to drop out of  them it meets a little stopper  laura do you want to pick me up because /none/ im short  mary let dren do it  travis and laura shes also pretty short  travis sure devan i would like to do that  laura thank you  ashly i mean dont get any ideas  travis shall we  mary yes  laura as we go i hit a ray of frost okay  mary i cast mage hand and place the mage hand direct it towards the tile that tarvis is standing on  liam okay and were moving forward  mary nope  travis as it appears wed like to do the old indiana /none/ jones like foot off  mary foot off put on and they take a step back as she casts ray of frost to see whether or not  itll hold  sam obby the rat runs  liam forward  sam forward  liam forward  sam this will not work i run  mary theres nothing behind us obby  liam obby bolts to the side of tarvis and books it down the hall  travis obby  liam he makes it like 15 feet and you hear another little click and immediately acid  starts spilling out of /none/ all the holes  laura shit  liam obby tarvis  travis son of a bitch like trickles of acid or like a shower of acid  liam a little spew of acid  mary so before you even got to step back  travis yep  mary thats shit well done obby  liam both of you make a dexterity check  sam who me or them  travis you  liam both of you  laura am i on his shoulders at this point already  liam who picked you up tarvis did  ashly tarvis did  /none/ liam yes you make a dexterity check as well  laura fuck  sam me too  liam yeah  sam 25  travis 13  liam was your dex check  sam yes  liam and you got what  travis 13  liam and you got  laura 19  liam 19 okay boy this is crazy obby hears like hissing and you do a dive and roll and you  feel a little drop of something splattering against your butt and burning into the seat of  your pants a little bit you immediately hear hissing and /none/ you wriggle free like a cat and  scratch down along the side of tarvis and tarvis you take a big ol dump of acid on your head and  take seven points of acid damage  travis seven  liam yeah  travis oh jesus i miss grog right now  liam youre burned youve got holes burned into your armor and into your shoulder and its still  stinging  ashly are you okay tarvis  travis oh you know i need a word with my good friend obby just a quick chat would you mind  waiting /none/ here for one second will you keep your finger on the button  sam is the acid still going  liam no it was about a ten second pee of acid from the holes  travis can i make my way up to obby hopscotching over the puddles of acid that i can see  liam yes yeah you can hear under your shoe is going sizzling  travis obby hey obby  sam im sorry i panicked  travis you did panic  sam you know why they call me obby the rat  travis why  sam rats /none/ survive  ashly who hugs obby when obby needs to be punished  travis that is a good question  sam well never know  liam the raven queen  mary yes  travis since youre so eager to make your way through the hall would you mind leading the way  for us at a good 20foot distance from the rest of us  sam obby will oblige  liam so obby hobbles ahead shamefacedly  laura it might be smart you guys to keep looking for little tiles because my grandmas  really paranoid  sam i will /none/ do a perception check to see if i see any more tiles  liam okay go for it  sam five  liam five well theres lots of tiles theres tiles from here all over  travis as he goes off i will also check the grounds around him  liam great  travis 14  laura better than five  liam youre scanning the ceiling really hard now for little holes and youre looking for any of  these tiles on the floor any marble tiles that look askew at all you dont see anything you do  though /none/ as youre walking looking down notice the little leather pack with the three healing  potions that you guys were allotted when you left and go oh good to know thats there youve got  it dont need to use it now but you have it eventually you guys all make it to the end of  this tunnel and obby youre the first one there you notice the same no you dont know what it  is you point this out to you tarvis same little circular shrew symbol about three feet off the  ground in a heavy /none/ wooden door  travis you know obby before they get here it was opened earlier by devan cutting her hand  really really deeply  sam i cut my hand  liam okay going to do anything with it  sam i cut my hand and put it there  liam okay your hand slowly dribbles out on the door you feel a little dizzy hungry  travis i meant to tell you she cut it a couple times  liam the others catch up with you you see the dwarf shoving his hand on it and you know thats /none/  not going to work  laura oh obby that only works with people that are related to her  sam i have a vast lineage  laura well then keep trying  sam does it work  liam no but you could keep trying all day maybe itll collect  mary try cutting the other hand  sam no  laura i loosen up the cut that i already dug in  liam yeah thats all you need to do is get your hand open  laura ow  liam 30 seconds and the way that it works it /none/ takes your grandma something like five or six  hours to set one of these or make one of these it takes your grandma about three seconds you  watched her do it youve never done this youve just watched her do it she cuts it and its open  its taking longer for you its taking like 20 or 30 seconds  laura shit it might not work  liam youre a weakass punk is the thing but eventually clicking  laura hey see  travis nicely done very useful  laura here to help  ashly so should /none/ we go in  mary does the door open  liam you open it  sam i will try  mary ill cast mage hand again and push against it  liam this spectral purple transparent hand pushes against the door and it goes creak and  soft warm light spills from over on the right youre looking in at some sort of cool dry  cellar its not that bright in here but the light thats coming from off to the side here lets  you see that there are shelves lining all the walls you see a lot /none/ of wooden boxes stacked next  to each other something like 20 of them against the wall and in the middle of the room which you  can see mostly from where youre standing are three pallets in a row of similar wooden crates  but the ones on the pallets are wedged together very tightly very orderly all in a row for  storage of some kind  mary well looks like weve got a storage room im not sure if its wine theres boxes along the  wall and theres three in the center but theyre rather purposefully /none/  travis does this look familiar to you at all  liam no it does not  laura no it doesnt i dont think ive ever been down in this room before but weve got to be  close to the basement  travis are we looking for the basement  laura well thats where she keeps a lot of her treasure  travis in the basement  laura yeah  travis can i insight check devan  liam sure  travis 12  liam oh man this is one of those instances where im going to homebrew it because /none/ i dont know  what the rule is  laura do i roll against it  liam yeah sure you do  mary thats it yeah no chat room so it doesnt matter  liam also dont tweet me because i dont care  laura i rolled a six  liam a six okay she seems nervous as fuck but shes not artfully carrying off any lie that you  can tell  travis shes nervous because obby is so attractive  liam im nervous because obby is so attractive  sam im squeezing the number one out of my /none/ moustache  laura ew so foul  travis the clasp we like to do things quietly if we hear any rumblings of trouble hide fair  enough  laura yeah  travis good  laura believe me if anything starts happening here you should hide because her magic is really  powerful  travis whats your relationship with her by the way good terms bad terms  laura terrible  travis really  sam what did you do was it a boy  laura so you know this thing have you heard of gambling  ashly oh i know gambling /none/  laura yeah its really fun right  ashly yeah  travis dren dren  ashly oh yeah sorry  laura so i took some of her money to do that thats all  mary how much  laura i dont know she has a big room of gold i just took some of it i really dont know  ashly could we take some gold too  laura thats what i mean but she might keep the emerald down there  mary do you remember which room that was  laura yeah its in the basement  mary the /none/ room of gold is in the basement  laura uhhuh  mary all right  travis you have pockets  ashly yeah  travis if we find a room of gold you can fill your pockets  ashly thanks tarvis  travis no worries  mary can i check for traps in this room as we enter  liam youre entering  mary yeah  liam okay as you step in you see where the light is coming from there is a small little  writing desk in the corner and theres a little globe very similar to your dancing /none/ lights  floating above the desk the desk is too small for the bigger folk in this group but its about the  right size for a halfling just a couple papers scattered on it  laura ooh can i go over and look at them  mary do you want me to check for traps first  liam yeah well whatever you roll  mary 18 perception so 18 19 20 24  liam you hold devan back as she presses forward and you eyeball the room for a good 15 seconds  check the ceiling no holes look /dung/ around the room seems okay  mary dren  ashly yes  mary you go check out that table  ashly sure yeah  mary you stay behind me  ashly stay behind prisoner i go over to the table do i need to make a check or anything or  can i  liam you can or i could just tell you what you see  ashly yeah just tell me what i see whats dungeons  dragons  mary wheres the dragon is this a dungeon  liam theres a couple of pieces of paper on the desk /none/ theres a letter made out to a cousin about  a wedding theres another letter about a disagreement over the price of fabric  ashly these are boring so far  mary do you see a log book  ashly do i see a log book  liam just a couple pieces of paper  ashly is there a drawer in the writing desk at all  liam there is  ashly can i open it  liam sure  ashly i open it  mary explosion  liam no  mary roll for initiative  liam there are more /none/ pieces of paper in there and you find bills of sale and amounts of coin  changing hands records of hers you see the names of a couple of money lenders listed in emon that  youre familiar with you randomly pull a contract for surveillance of general krieg tristan thats  a name that raises your eyebrows everyone in emon knows him thats it its a lot of business  transactions but you cant really make out what or who i mean not what you can tell whats  being changed hands for the most part but who knows /none/ who bought who knows who sold  ashly and theres nothing like hidden or tricksy  liam make a perception check  ashly thats not going to work but here we go one  laura oh no were halfling  ashly oh hey except my perception is zero eight  travis your perceptions zero  mary yes  laura this is the one that got me killed so i dont know if you want to roll that  ashly so were going to replace this guy with a new one  travis there is no one more jinxy than laura /none/ no one more superstitious  ashly ooh this is the pretty one ill use this one  laura yeah  sam oh that got someone else killed  laura no no it didnt  travis she runs up her dice more than a professional athlete its crazy  liam tarvis you also notice theres a couple pieces of paper also lying helterskelter on top  of the pallets as well theres papers all over this room  ashly i collect all of it and i bring it to tarvis  travis are there any records or binders ledgers things like /none/ that  liam no you crack the lid off one of these boxes and it is full of paper and you pull it  out you take a couple of minutes to look through this stuff whats weird is that again it is all  about amounts of money being moved around and bills of sale but theres no names but theres  weird words that pop up over and over again like you see the word shortstack like seven times  whisperer appears several times you see on a bill of sales adelaides signature and then next  to /none/ it is the word overbite but you dont know what it means but it seems to have some sort of  pattern  ashly does it make any sense to you tarvis  travis not sure yet do i recognize any code or a cipher in the writing  liam make a straightup intelligence check  laura natural 20  travis nine  mary 11  liam its like carpets being sold some weapons being sold a loan  travis okay  mary can i investigate the boxes on the wall  liam sure make an investigation check  laura /none/

maverick goose hollywood  travis wolfman  sam i cant make it out  travis slider  liam that is true  travis sundown  mary do you feel the need /none/ for anything  laura i start heading towards the exit of the room  mary excuse me dear  ashly oh excuse me you cant go by yourself im in charge of you get behind me  laura sure  ashly sorry guys she  mary i do have rope if she gets out of hand we

you said it was in the dungeon or the basement  laura yeah this is not the basement this is a storage room  travis all right as we go back up towards the stairs can we check the /none/ walls for any secrets  liam in the room or in the stairway  travis up the stairway  liam yeah sure  travis 22  liam you two are the big ballers with perception yeah its a wellmade staircase  travis great dren will

still have your lights going  laura yes  liam yeah okay theres light flickering from behind the group all the way near the back and so  youre seeing shadows and light flicker in this room and in this room you cant see the whole  room yet but you see glimpses of rows of chests thick wooden chests solid locks /none/ on some of  them not all of them but neatly done in little aisles each one about two feet tall big thick  bastards you recognize this room peering through this is where you used to skim from  grandmas stores although youre a little confused because theres only one door to this room  sam wait this is the only door in  mary the door that we just came through is the only door  liam youre disoriented this is not how youre used to entering it  laura right i came in from the other way

for traps  liam okay make a perception check  mary 12 no yes 12  liam okay devans globes of light are floating lazily around the room close to you and again  the shadows are shifting moving slowly but

your hand  travis who can check for magic  ashly whats the difference between perception and investigation  liam perception is seeing and spotting things hearing things investigation is looking at stuff  left behind and going how does that connect to that /none/  laura do you want me to grab some gold to show you its fine were not here for the gold but  sure and i pick up some gold  liam okay  travis yeah that was bad its not on alarm  sam a dragon appears  ashly oh thats why its called dungeons  dragons  liam but as you dig your hand into this gold and pull and up and coins fall away you

over there seems to be desk tables stuff you associate with an office but right  where youre coming out you see in the middle of the floor going up to the ceiling a weird looking  brass column going from the floor all the way up to the /tavern/ ceiling and there are constellations that  you are familiar with from books and from living in emon as long as you have spiraling beautifully  all the way up this column up to the ceiling and then around that are dog beds five dog beds you  also see a really large bone in the largest one you see a ragged hydra doll with a couple of heads  ripped away and it looks like its been whipped around ragged theres a crude leather ball made  out of leather fabric wrapped up and thats this side of the /tavern/ room  ashly i skitter back to everyone and i go devan  laura yeah  ashly does your grandma like dogs  laura does my grandma like dogs  ashly like own them  liam she didnt have dogs when you lived here  laura yeah like well i mean not that i know of

at least and theres a beautiful globe in a brass fixture on one side of the desk on the other side  is a bookstand like a bible stand if youve ever seen one with a huge book with red ink in it and a  red ribbon hanging down the /none/ binding of it looks tancolored maybe leather theres a huge table  on the far end of the room with papers scattered all over it  travis are there any windows or doors

in space all down the hallway stretches  out about 80 90 feet ahead of you the hallway is absolutely littered with countless strange  extraordinary and occasionally offputting objects this is taliesin jaffes wet dream  objects of beauty and horror are mixed together /none/ in a crazed jumble along each side of this hall  there are paintings hanging all the way down each more unsettling than the one before a large fish  skeleton hangs way down on the other end of the hall it looks about fifteen feet long things  right nearby that you spot there are a crude pair of heavy black iron tongs a unicorn fetus in a  very large jar pickled and curled in on itself a set of eerie looking dolls beautifully crafted  but with no eyes the front plate smashed in stacks of books /none/ everywhere a large stuffed bear  rearing back with a giant open snarl then all the way down the hall you see ornate gothic  creepy as fuck looking chandeliers three of them evenly spaced down the hall and they look like  cruel teeth pointed downward but they are gorgeous theyre stunning to look at you almost  dont know whether to shit or go blind you dont know where to look theres so much stuff and  youve seen this before most of it theres new things here things you havent seen and youre  overwhelmed youre shortcircuiting /none/ with all the things youre looking at around you  mary devan what do you remember  laura i remember  mary close your eyes what do you remember  travis do you remember  laura i remember a shield  sam shield  liam you look over your shoulder and you see that theres two of them on the walls to the  side of both doors theyre black with a red barren tree in winter painted identically on each  one hanging decoratively  sam were the shields traps or something  laura theres a very specific thing /none/ we have to do when we go down this hallway  sam okay what is it  laura well does somebody want to go over to the shield on the right  sam i will do it  laura lift it up  sam will

hiding behind these books  ashly if we go deeper in the room you might see something  liam ill also remind you that there /none/ were two doors that she opened using blood  sam weve got to keep her hand with us  mary we could keep a vial of her blood  travis just bring her hand with us  ashly its a lot easier if we take her with us i feel like  mary so what were you trying to do with the shield  laura well i remember my grandma did some stuff and things happened and we had to do things in a  very specific order but she also said  sam how did you do that  /none/ laura i dont know these are so tight i dont even know how my hand came out of it i also  remember her saying not to touch anything  travis laughter i cant imagine why  liam obby as shes rattling this off youre spacing out looking around the room checking out  the artwork on the wall the one right above you is of a ship splitting open on the sea and the  crews are plunging into the waves in the center of it you look across the hall over there is one of  mourners at /none/ an open grave filled to the brim with blood you also look around and notice a gorgeous  metallic egg studded with jewels all around it beautiful  sam how big  liam this big a little bit bigger than a regular egg a teapot made out of it looks like bone  sam well i like this art better  laura dont touch it i keep looking for a wall sconce obby when you touched the shield did you  hear a click did you hear anything click  sam yes felt a click  laura lets look for /none/ the wall sconce  sam were supposed to push up the shield and then tilt back a wall sconce or something  laura you pull out a wall sconce yeah  sam pull out a wall sconce  laura yeah  mary is there a holder for it behind one of the paintings maybe  laura do we see anything  sam

see if i can intuit how it works  liam investigation check  travis 19 /none/  sam four  liam tarvis you see poking out of the edge of the carpet you know how downstairs there was a  long red carpet theres one here as well you see a bit of scrawl something poking out of the edge  of the rug about eight feet in front of you  travis be careful of the rug its booby trapped  laura gasp okay do i see a bowl a plate anywhere a bowl with water in it  liam not offhand no  ashly do i because i got a 17  liam no /none/ bowl you do see a really cool little brass and wood clockwork owl thats cool  ashly that is cool  sam should we start opening things and  laura no dont touch anything  sam well something needs to happen or we leave this room  ashly devan and i will go deeper into the room and if anything goes screwy well get hit by it  and then maybe well find that wall sconce  travis no dren you stay here delweth will go with devan  ashly okay  liam walking forward going down the hall  /none/ laura i send a message to dren  travis i walk up to the little part of the carpet that has the little bit sticking out from under  the carpet  liam you do that before they walk off  travis yes before they go  liam all right you peel it back there is some sort of arcane scrawl on the floor  travis like scrawl  liam yeah like a ring written in a circle you tug the rug back a bit and you see it goes further  under the carpet and you see the edge /none/ of a spiral pattern of writing that you cant  mary is it elvish  travis i was going to ask  liam its not  travis oh its not  liam no  mary dwarvish  liam no  travis orcish  liam make an arcana check  travis oh me no problem thats a motherfucking one  laughter  liam that is esperanto  travis cool  sam i can jump on things and unlock

much shit in here that its like process a little bit as you go  mary all right lets take it real slow  travis what if you do an arcana check  mary can i do an arcana check on the scrawl  liam sure  mary forget about it thats 18 plus what do i add 18 plus three thats 21  liam yeah you know what this is  mary of course i do  liam how do you /none/ think you know magic you had to study  mary yeah i know what this is  liam you dont know all of it you would never be able to make this on your own but you recognize  some of the key glyphs in it this is a magic sigil this will turn gravity haywire here you  look straight up at one of the iron gothic toothlike chandeliers right above it  mary right do not step here from what i can see if you do youll be thrown up into the  ceiling into the teeth of /none/ this fantastic chandelier so my recommendation would be to go  around  travis if we cross this threshold or if we step here  laura are there any wall sconces up top  travis are there  liam no there is enough room on the sides to gingerly step around this  mary i grab the back of the rope of your hands youre in the lead im behind you i hold you  with my left hand and i have my rapier in my right we start to move very slowly on exposed  wood that we can /none/ see whether or not theres going to be any  liam so what are you saying someones pulling carpet as you go or its one carpet that goes all  the way down the hall and tarvis went and under this part of the carpet was one area  sam were avoiding the carpet altogether  mary we cant because its wall to wall right  liam its not wall to wall its a very wide hall and its down the center and all the eclectic  craziness is piled up to the sides of it i mean some stuff /none/ spills over on the rug but its pretty  hodge podge  travis were there windows that were along the wall  liam no windows up here  mary so we make our way down the right side on the wood  liam you cant do that because the wood all the way down is taken up by things like jars with  pickled unicorns in them  laura but we can avoid the gravity scrawl  liam this one spot you can sneak around  mary all right well sneak around that and slowly work our way forward  /none/ laura keeping an eye on the ground for any more of those things  liam okay you pass by a portrait of a woman all in black stiff austere dress a cold white face  and you double take and look at it again and realise that that woman is dead and theres a fly  crawling in the side of her mouth on the other side theres a painting of a large still lake  stretching away from the shore and theres a small boat drifting off in the middle and theres a  piece of fabric draped into /none/ the water and things floating in the side of it  mary grandmother had a very strange definition of fun  laura i think she might be into some creepy shit  travis is the dead woman behind a case or is she out the dead woman  liam its a painting you see an assortment of bells covering the top of one table all different  sizes and different colors of metal a platter with a series of bone needles lying on it you see  a stuffed ostrich with a little skull cap metal pith helmet with a /none/ spike coming out of it on one  armoire theres a shiny black stone wasp as big as a bird also gorgeous a wicker rabbit with  antlers protruding from its head  mary a wabbit with antlers  liam yes arcane jackalope  sam tarvis has told me to pick up the wasp  laura dont pick up anything dont touch anything  liam pick up the wasp  laura seriously  liam make a con save  travis well you dont have to  liam it is done

wrist you take two points of damage  sam what kind  liam poison  sam no i am a dwarf advantage on saves versus poison resistance against poison damage  liam resistant nice you take one point and you have a small red hole bleeding out in your hand  sam i suck the poison out i swallow it down  travis you are hard /none/ as nails obby the rat  laura through all of this have we seen a wall sconce  liam youre still walking down the hall whats our order by the way  mary devans first im second  liam devans first  travis im third drens fourth  liam theres also enough room to go side by side which

investigating everything as we go  liam are you looking for traps further traps  mary i use my mage hand to push the carpet as we go forward to see if theres anything  liam sure but also make a
