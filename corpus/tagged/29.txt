none	 matt hello everyone welcome to critical role tonight  we have some interesting adventurous points to go over  were also coming off international tabletop day  which we had a great time  met a lot of the wonderful fans one of which  had created their own tshirt of our group  and inspired us to do the same  so youll see a bunch of us wearing our fantastic  full assortment of critical role party member tshirts tonight  just for fun  in the meantime let’s go ahead and get this started  as we 
town	 all have the chance to warm up with  character backgrounds and maybe a little surprise  so be back here in a few minutes guys  drumming battle music  drumming battle music continues  ashley pike grew up in the outskirts of town  near the bramblewood  her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes  with quite an unfavorable reputation  thievery destruction and trickery left them  with the curse of the last name trickfoot  sarenrae the goddess of healing and redemption  had other plans for pikes greatgreatgrandfather  wilhand who left his 
none	 family at a young age  after a dream  a dream that changed the course  of the trickfoot family  wilhand devoted his life to sarenrae  and pledged from then on that him and his family  would live a life of service and devotion  as a child pike seemed to have an affinity to heal  whether it was animals people or even flowers  she felt she had a purpose in making things whole  that had once been broken  she studied and learned the ways to heal  through divine magic  
none	 she lived a peaceful life quiet and simple  until one day wilhand was captured  and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians  one of the goliaths took a stand  against the murder of the innocent gnome  and he himself was beaten bloodied and left for dead  abandoned by his herd  wilhand went to pike for help  she prayed and healed this barbarian  as best she could bringing him back to life  when he awoke she discovered his name  was grog strongjaw  after that they were best of 
none	 friends  a rather unlikely pair  little did she know that in a few years time  grog would soon return the favor  and bring her back from the clutches of death  after being killed in battle  pike felt angry  she wanted to be stronger  so that it would never happen again  she spent four months at sea  training with the men and women  aboard a ship called the broken howl  gripping her holy symbol in one hand  and her morningstar in the other  this time pike is 
none	 ready  travis right listen up if you have ale  then you have a friend in grog strongjaw  a goliath of towering height and size  this barbarian has an appetite for the two great  loves in his life combat women and ale chuckle  record scratch  wait  easily the brains of the group  grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge  of shapes colors and chuckle shiny things  also ale  in his early years armed with his twohanded great axe  grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks 
none	  of his familys wandering herd  but after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods  he objected to the killing such an innocent life  a creature of impulse grog felt only pity for this  well this terrified little thing  and his disobedience cost him dearly  weapon crack  beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader  his uncle kevdak  grog was abandoned and left to die  exiled from his herd it was then that  the relative of the very gnome he fought to save  saved him  
none	 it was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike  that healed grog bringing him back from deaths edge  and they have remained close friends ever since  brawling sounds  most nights grog can be found challenging  entire taverns to wrestling matches ha  or accompanying scanlan to the nearest house  where you pay for  lady favors  also ale  marisha a first impression of keyleth would  leave you with little information  on the halfelven druid  you might even think that her social awkwardness  due to her sheltered upbringing 
none	 is kinda sweet  chuckle  of course it would be unwise underestimate her  based on first impressions  thunder crack  under that unintimidating petite frame is a  vicious beast waiting to be unleashed  whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of  champions pee their pants literally  soft chuckle  born to the air tribe of the ashari people  keyleth was raised with a deep love  of nature and the elemental magics  it is her people’s inherent duty to protect the  delicate areas in taldorei  where the four 
none	 elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm  since she was a little girl she had quite a knack  for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities  well if you consider kittens and  flying squirrels to be little beasts  which i do  clears throat  anyways it wasnt long before the headmaster of the tribe  her father kohren  realized her true prodigious abilities and  she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster  just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and  replaced with endless spell memorization  teachings 
none	 from ancient traditions  and exceedingly high expectations  every druid leader to be must embark on a journey  to seek out the sister tribes  in order to introduce and establish respect  amongst the fellow headmasters  they call this the aramente or noble odyssey  when her father felt she was ready he set her on the path  to truly discovering herself  not knowing when or if she will ever return  as she hiked down the mountain towards stillben  she meditated on the task ahead  part of the aramente is proving 
none	 yourself  a strong warrior a valiant protector  and a wise and compassionate leader  with this knowledge one thought plays  in repeat in her mind  is she even worthy  taliesin percy was the third child of 7 children  born to a noble family who lived far to the  north in the ancient castle of whitestone  with so many siblings to share the burdens of  lordship percy turned his attention to the  sciences engineering and naturalism  one day a mysterious couple  named lord and lady briarwood came to court 
dung	  during a feast held in their honor  the briarwoods violently took control of the castle  killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way  percy awoke chained in the dungeon  only to be freed by his younger sister  together they fled chased by the briarwoods’ men  as they ran percy’s sister took  several arrows to the chest and fell  percy kept running eventually jumping into  a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom  he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat  he barely remembered the 
none	 next two years as he  slowly made his way as far south as possible  then one night percy had a dream  a roaring cloud of smoke offered him  vengeance against those who destroyed his family  when he awoke percy began to design his first gun  sound of a gun cocking and firing  sam oh you haven’t heard of scanlan shorthalt  well gird your loins ladies  because he has his eye on you  a talented musician master of disguise and dashingly  handsome in his own mind scanlan sings songs  
none	 almost as much as he sings his own praises  born a poor gnome scanlan used his endless  charm and soaring tenor voice to  croon for coin and support his single mother  one day he was discovered by a halforc promoter  and joined dr dranzel’s spectacular traveling troupe  where he learned the ways of the world  and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire  a loner much of his life scanlan has never quite  come to terms with the violent death  of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion 
town	  while his years on the road provided many shall we say  educational experiences with the opposite sex  deep down scanlan yearns for the one thing  he’s never known the true love  of a fellow gnome  still scanlan considers himself a lover first  performer second and fighter distant third  on the battlefield he’ll support his allies  but rarely draws blood unless it’s to protect  fellow gnome pike count on scanlan for a hearty laugh  a rollicking song and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts  and makes the 
town	 females swoon  orion greetings and salutations  i am tiberius stormwind  i hail from a town called tyrex  located in the heart of draconia  born from a politically respected family  at the age of 15 i succeeded in passing the sorcerer’s rite  showing prodigylike control of my magic  the judges and the draconian high council were amazed at  how powerful my spells were for how long i had been training  at 20 years old i was the youngest appointed member  of the magic guild in draconian history for the  
none	 next few years i almost went mad from the  malaise of being a guild member  as it’s rather boring  however one day i happened upon a chamber  unused for quite some time  in the room were stacks of books and maps  of the surrounding cities and areas  around the known world  for months i would frequent the chamber and learned  of artifacts from legend  after a long period of research i made a list of artifacts  that caught my eye  i brought these findings to the high council 
town	 and was told that  all of the information in the chamber i had stumbled upon  was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries  and hence were lost forever  i found those answers to be unacceptable  a year later i devised a ruse and managed to  convince the city council to lend support  in me leaving draconia on a mission of peace  and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms  going from town to town and making friends and allies  in and for the name of draconia  being a red dragonborn 
none	  i had quite the task on my hands in that respect  but it was exactly what i needed so i could explore  the world and find these artifacts  as i felt the truth was out there  some may describe me as buffoonish  but i say poppycock to all that  i am much sharper than most give me credit for  i just don’t pay attention to things sometimes  i’ve also been known to be rather cunning loyal  happygolucky and well dangerous  i can’t help but show my true scales every 
none	 now and then  but overall i think i’m quite friendly for a dragonborn  liam never entirely welcome in the company of  elves or men vaxildan learned  at a young age to skip past formality  preferring instead to invite himself in your door  along with twin sister vexahlia  vax was born by a chance encounter between elven  royalty and human peasantry  raised by their mother in their early years the twins  were eventually sent off to their father  in the elven capital of singorn  but their cool reception among 
town	 the elves there never warmed  and their time in the capital didn’t last  the siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on  the open road  after a few years of wandering they eventually decided to  return to their mother and journeyed  back to the lands of their youth  but instead of finding their childhood home  they returned to a pile of rubble  their mother was gone their home burned to ash  pressing the townspeople for answers  they learned of the day the dragon came  dragon roaring 
none	  with their ties all severed vaxildan and his sister  set out to find their fortune together in taldorei  an outsider since birth vax quickly learned to solve life’s  challenges in his own particular way  often by sidestepping them entirely  and when his knack for circumventing adversity isn’t enough  ringing weapons sfx  the way of blades the elves schooled him in  more than makes up the difference  laura like so many halfelves  vexahlia has spent most of her life suffering  the cool reception of a people who don’t fully 
none	 accept her  born of a human mother and an elven father  who only later in life  took an interest in their existence  vexahlia and her twin brother vaxildan quickly  realized the only people they could truly rely on  in this world were each other  it was at the age of 10 when the two were taken from their mother  and brought to live in singorn  the isolated elven city for which their father  was an ambassador  he quietly took them in but always kept an icy distance  and 
none	 after too many years of disdainful looks  the pair decided to leave his indifference behind  and set out on their own  vax took to the cities stealing small trinkets and  learning the ways of the thief  while vex kept to the woods  she preferred the isolation  always the keen observer she learned to hunt and to track  to spy and to shoot  and through a series of fateful events  earned herself a companion in the form of a bear   her own stolen trinket   to fight alongside 
none	 her and protect her fiercely  also he is adorable and gives expert massages  matt welcome back everyone the new intro tonight  which i think were all pretty damn proud of  was put together by our fantastic overlord zac  all cheering  matt it put him to work for quite some time  also the mixing and sound effects done by  the amazing alex neat and the music you heard  was composed by the amazingly talented  jason charles miller  so if you dont know jason you should look him up  hes

town	 arcanist allura vysoren  in search of a halfling paladin  a very revered folk hero named lady kima of vord  who had gone missing following a vision quest  somewhere beneath the dwarven city of kraghammer  supposedly for some great evil that was germinating there  festering and growing  after you guys traversed through the dwarven city  you began to find your way down into the mines  the mythril mines of greyspine beneath the dwarven town  after a few fateful encounters the return of your gnome cleric  ashley hey thats me  
none	 matt grog having his proverbial brains blown out  by an intellect devourer  the party then decided to make friends with a mind flayer  an illithid that had been cast out from its people  seeking vengeance and possible return to its people  upon making this alliance  they made an attack on the dwarven or the duergar  war camp that is threatening to rise up  and attack kraghammer  from deep within the mountains themselves  the attack was successful  the general was killed interrogated  and some interesting information was gleaned from 
none	 him  before his brain was sucked out from his head  by clarota the mindflayer friend  however this attack also announced to the local war camp  of your presence and in the process of attempting  to escape  the druid was damaged and lost her eagle form  and thus began a freefall of many party members  a haphazard attempt to use the magic carpet  far over its weight limit led most of the party  to come crash landing and nearly killing everyone  managed to escape  walled themselves in thanks to 
none	  keyleth’s stone wall spell  and after staying the evening in one  of the deeper tunnels  and barely avoiding a roving band of duergar there  you managed to find yourselves in battle with 2 ogres  carrying some sort of strange mutated  black pudding ooze  contained in a glass container  the glass container being shattered of course  by an explosive arrow created by percy and fired by vex  laura go us  matt at the very start of the battle  led into a very rough battle  with this strange 
none	 mutating ooze  that kept splitting and splitting  until through some good teamwork  crafty use of telekinesis and a nearby lava pool  and general high damage rolls  you guys managed to survive the encounter  travis barely  matt making your way to the bottom of this tunnel  you found yourself looping back around  to the large crevice  where the giant waterfall had fallen in before  where you had met clarota  which allowed you to retrieve your bear trinket  laura yeah trinket  matt we pick up as you guys 
none	 begin to step down  into the lower tunnels  the ones that are partially coated  with a series of magma pools and falls  that are trickling out of the rockside  all right everyone  sam i was just so out of it last time  have we rested  are we in some need of rest  laura we should probably rest  sam what are we around  whats near us  is this just a tunnel  is there any sort of shelter caves  laura were by that lake with the giant monster 
none	  liam we circled all the way back around  sam oh shit  laura and went down to that place  that you told us not to go in the first place  yeah thats where we ended up  sam how was that for you  all laugh  matt so essentially there was  sam were back in the camp  matt youre under the camp  youre where the giant chasm leads down into the waterfall  there is a pool of water at the bottom  where the aboleth was in the water  liam 
none	 we just barely survived the chat room  and now we need to rest  travis chuckles the chatroom  take it easy on us all right  matt you guys also just woke up about 2 3 hours ago  laura right so we dont really   oh we can take hit points  matt you guys can take a short rest  and use your hit dice to heal up  you didnt take any damage last game  thankfully you stayed out of the fray  sam so im okay  thats all i need to 
none	 know  matt you did use one of your dominate spells  sam okay  matt only thing of note  so the rest of you who need to heal up  can use this time to take a short rest  and use your hit dice to heal up on your own  travis im ready  who we fighting next  sam anyone need some healing  are we all okay are we all good  ashley i think were all good  wheres everybody at in terms of  orion well im fine  laura on a 
none	 personal level or  ashley you mean like in life or  sam as we survey the area  how many tunnels we looking at  whats our options here  matt so  all laugh  travis hes back hes back  orion would you calm down  matt let me pull out this visual aid for you  this is the tunnel sequence  you guys have traversed down to the main area  where the goblin encampment was  this is the large bridge that went across the giant chasm  to where the duergar war camp 
none	 was  this is the giant dropoff at the waterfall  you guys are currently in this section  about to go deeper into this tunnel  where a series of small magma trickles are pouring  out of the rock  sam so we never went up to the war camp and through it  matt you did  sam oh we did  liam we crashed down by the tunnel we fled  we sealed up the way behind us ran in  sam got it so we should keep going  we should just keep going  
town	 magma follow the magma  liam well i recommend  we dont want to go up and through the camp again  laura no no no were going into the cavern  liam so were going to backtrack the way we came  to that war camp road yes  laura no were going into the tunnel  sam did you see the visual aid  orion yes we are going into the lava tunnel  laura no no no in through the tunnel  liam i’ll just follow i thought i understood  matt laughs it’s been a week 
none	  sam i mean there might be something to be gleaned  from going back to the war camp  laura that tunnel  liam we went out of there  laura no no no no no  matt you guys came through here  you traveled across over the war camp  went back here and tunneled below  laura and popped this out right there  so now were going into this  matt correct maps  liam and just to make sure that my memory is on point  travis its not  liam before we circled 
town	 back around  we hit a fork in the road where we could have gone up  and we could have gone down  matt correct  liam so thats behind us  laura thats behind us were going down down down  liam cheers  matt cheers indeed huzzah all right  laura shall we  ashley we shall  sam is clarence with us still  matt clarota is indeed with you  clarota took a large black iron duergar bolt  to the chest earlier and is mostly recovered  but is still even more hunched than 
none	 usual  laura does he need healing  ashley he also ate those brains  matt the brains helped him  ashley helped him a little bit  matt keep healthy but hes still a little wounded  but hes taking his time to rest up  he seems to be okay  not as worse for wear as he was before  a slight wheeze thats always to him still present  ashley hes just always a little weezy  laura  liam meh meh meh sounds  matt sounds just like that  so as you guys begin 
none	 to push down into this lower chasm  the temperature of the air itself  grows steadily warmer and warmer with a drier heat  orion this feels nice  matt you find yourselves especially those of you  with thick armor  ashley oh its so hot  matt you find that sweat beads begin to  trickle down the side of your face  ashley im sweating  marisha youre all glisteny  matt and begin to pool and gather in parts of your chestplate  sam pike if youd like me to hold your armor  or 
none	 do you want me to take it off for a little while  ashley no ill keep it on just for safety  sam let it hang out a little bit  liam do you even lift bro  sam just saying you might feel more comfortable  with a loose fitting sort of cloak  laura scanlan stop being creepy  sam im not creepy im just trying to be mindful  ashley no its fine scanlan  travis very considerate of you a gentlemans offer  ashley yeah it’s okay ill keep it on  sam ill just 
none	 have to use my imagination  marisha a gentlemans offer yes  thats what well call it from now on  travis what permission  sam onward  matt pressing further down the air itself that once  had a kind of a hint of that sulfur smell  is now becoming stronger and stronger as you step  deeper and deeper into this cavernous tunnel  it rests about 30 feet to 40 feet at width and about  25 30 feet up and it varies to come pinched tighter  or wider at moments but it continues to 
none	 be  a steady downward climb in a continuous direction  the small trickles some of them pool  and gather into these small magma cups if you will  molten hot magma i knew it was coming  orion murmurs i was just wondering if it would happen  matt ooh thats minus 200 experience points  all laugh  orion i feel a bit weaker now  matt you get about 20 or 30 minutes deeper into this  tunnel  before the sweltering heat gets noticeably warmer  and as you crest a slight incline and decline 
none	  over a small hill portion of this tunnel  you can see now a large portion of the rock has  collapsed on the left side and a gargantuan pool of magma  is pooling into the tunnel essentially covering  half of the tunnel you are traversing down  it can be walked on the side of safely at about 2 or 3  at shoulder width but you only have about  a 15 foot width here  and the rest of it is just extremely bright hot molten rock  laura does it hurt us to 
none	 get near it  matt no but its uncomfortable and something  to be very aware of and to watch your step  orion i feel great  matt you feel great  liam i would just like to point out that were 9 adults playing  dont touch the hot lava at the moment  all laugh  sam keyleth you dont have any way of   say it gets hotter than this  you dont have any way of getting some water out here  orion ooh i do and i pull out an empty bottle  
none	 laura oh oh  liam tiberius ive seen that bottle a lot what does it do  orion oh um well uh i pull out two bottles  this one  theyre both empty bottles   but this one is an air bottle and this one is a water bottle  liam oh thank you that clears that up  all laugh  travis even i feel dumber right now  all laugh  sam your intelligence is now 4  all laugh  travis 43 and a half  liam does it make a lot of water  
none	 orion oh this if we ever need air  sam i think thats the water one that you just pulled out  orion i take it out wind sfx  i control a small gust  laura yes but what about water  oh my  orion this if we need water   and i do a small stream  matt okay so a little bit of water just begins to pour perpetually  and without seeming end due to the size of the bottle  sam its like a piss stream  laura oh nice  orion so 
none	 if you want to just squirt   and i do a small little squirtblasts on scanlan  sam ahh  laura oh okay lovely  liam is that unlimited  orion well of course it is  why would i carry a nonmagical item on me  thats ridiculous  ashley just a water bottle  orion so yes scanlan were fine  sam thats good to know  laura so should we try to cross this little path here  ashley that sounds cool  sam thats really cool  laura can i use my tracking to see 
none	 any of those duergar  to see if any of them have passed through the area  if theres a large group of them ahead of us  matt sure  laura i can use my tracking and my favored terrain  to see how many within 6 miles  if theres a large group of them  matt yes you can all right  go ahead and roll for your tracking check on that  liam first roll  matt i believe its survival  laura ooh here we go  travis do it for the star wars trailer 
none	  marisha roll roll roll  matt this is with advantage i believe  because its your favored terrain correct  laura oh okay  marisha singing your favored terrain  laura okay thats better  is that it  liam survival  laura 21  matt 21 all right  you take a moment  and about 30 to 40 feet you go through  and inspect the way the terrains been pushed  and the dirt has been shoved aside  tracking footprints and scuff marks on the rock  and the walls nearby seeing if any of 
none	 the flows  have been interrupted recently and you ascertain  that there is actually a pretty continuous patrol through here  about once every 4 to 8 hours up and down this tunnel  that contain anywhere from 5 to 10 or more duergar  sometimes other larger creatures  you find footprints that resemble maybe the ogres  you mentioned earlier possible troll footprints  but youre not familiar with that entity  you also notice some of the walls have what looks like  small localized caveins almost as if something  had burrowed through at one 
none	 time or another  travis awesome great  matt large large creatures so theres also things  that exist outside of the tunnel system  ashley like tremors  laura so as quickly as possible we should get  through these tunnels i assume  matt probably a good idea  as a note though you said within 6 miles  laura yes  sam 6 miles  matt as you continue tracking down this tunnel   and it takes you a good 3 or 4 hours to finally reach a point  where the tunnel begins to widen 
town	 up   you assess that maybe 3 miles up  there is a localized town  or at least a population of duergar amassed  in a central place  liam check out the brain on brad  laura so 3 to 4 miles up you said  from where we are at this point  matt yeah from where you began  travis should we be stealthing  laura we should probably start stealthing  at this point yes  liam yes i was about to say id like to move  ahead of the group a bit 
none	 and start sneaking along  matt lets do that go ahead and roll stealth  liam do i have advantage like my sister had for  matt you do not  liam no all right well  laura should we all try to stealth  liam 26 for me  matt this would be a group stealth check  liam 26 ive tiptoed away  sam 19  marisha 15  taliesin 7  travis 17  ashley 7  laura 20  liam 26  matt all right  ashley laughs  matt picking up on the shortcomings of 
none	 a handful of members  of your group you do manage to maintain what you feel is  a fairly stealthy advance deeper into this tunnel system  about an hour and a half of perpetual travel  as the tunnel slowly widens further and further  with every quarter mile or so you eventually  get to a point where the tunnel shoots open  into a gargantuan cavern  a chamber nearly a mile and a half across  from this visual point  ashley quietlyof secrets  matt it is extremely tall with hundreds of very jagged 
none	  stalagmites hanging from the ceiling  and rock formations that rise and fall at different points  of the topography this entire tunnel is built  in this strange large natural  downward curve that disappears out of sight  about a mile ahead and to the left  but this huge tunnel is lit with what looks like maybe  2 to 3 dozen various small lava falls that are pouring  down the sides of this giant caverns structure  you also see some small pockets of that red glow stone  that a lot of these 
none	 dwarven tunnels tend to use  as a light source  you also as you begin to step into this carefully   you taking point on this both the twins you notice   on the far end of this cavern…  well first off the entire landscape is rough and craggy  with large black obsidian spikes  just jutting out of the ground at various points  whether it be seismically created or otherwise  its a very unwelcoming atmosphere  and that sulfurous smell is extremely strong  even though you’ve gotten used to it as 
town	 far as you can  for this travel it’s still a very pungent odor  and you find that it’s going to be very difficult for you  to make out any other scent in this location right now  other than that horrible mixture of chemicals that probably  isn’t very healthy to be breathing at the moment  what you see across the chamber your eyes focus  on a small cluster of buildings it looks of a similar construct  as the barracks that you saw at the war camp  you can probably surmise somewhere in 
none	 the neighborhood  of about 20 to 25 of these structures  all localized in this one area  that is punctuated with   you can count about 7 of these black obsidian spires  that rise out at different points around like watchtowers  liam still natural  matt no these are constructed  these are very smooth and have that  rigid dwarvish construction  with a jagged edge to each one of the leveled lips  of these towers  the one that you can see closest to you  which is about a quarter mile 
town	 off  you can just barely make out what looks like a couple of duergar  walking across one of the upper levels  and what looks like some sort of ballista andor  antipersonnel weapon that is put  laura this is where kima’s being held  sam how do you know that  laura she had a vision  orion plus it’s a really big thing  sam that’s true  matt these giant boltthrowers currently reside on  each one of these  and then in the center of this cluster of buildings  you see standing 
none	 a gargantuan ebony fortress  serrated stonework marks the top of each wall  and more of these giant boltthrowers  are mounted across the parapets  a massive magma fall descends from the rocky ceiling  right above the stronghold onto the roof  and is forked onto each side and then continues to flow down  buttressing each side of the stronghold almost as  a defense mechanism  like they built it intentionally underneath this magma fall  sam wow  laura oh that’s where the trapdoor is  sam what trapdoor  travis there’s a trapdoor 
tavern	  laura yeah  marisha waitunder the magma  laura you missed a lot scanlan marisha oh right  sam i was with you the whole time  orion yes but you were never paying attention  sam i was drunk  orion you got that new magazine and you’ve  been staring at it a long time  sam well it’s hot gnomes  liam vax creeps back to pike and ushers her up to the front  do you recall any of the details from your vision  from your dreams  ashley i’ve definitely been here in 
none	 my vision  all laugh  ashley i do remember that much  all of this looks familiar  and i think we’re in the right place  laura sweet  orion very good that’s all important  ashley do we know what else is around  what was the building again with the  sam it’s a fortress  matt the giant building you see is called emberhold  that’s what it’s been referred to as  sam and it’s not a temple  matt it’s not a temple it is a fortress  the temple of where apparently 
tavern	 kvarn  as far as you know exists  is further below in the fungal forest that  surrounds this ancient city ruin  that has been repurposed by the illithids  that clarota actually came from  laura oh yes and we know here because the general  that we mind melded  clarota read his brain  sam yeah i was there  laura i know it’s just you were drunk so i’m reiterating it  all laugh  sam yeah yeah good thank you for that  orion just making sure  taliesin you had this very 
none	 vivid look the whole time  laura so remember scanlan that the general said  that on the left side of the fortress  sam of the fortress  laura is how we can get into the trapdoor  sam how we can get into the trapdoor exactly  liam by the smaller  sam smaller  liam of two lava flows laura by the smaller of two lava flows  sam of twowhat  laura lava flows  ashley so what we’re looking at is the fortress  laura yes  matt you’re looking at emberhold itself  the 
none	 center of the duergar society and from what you’ve gleaned  from two different duergar that you’ve interrogated  supposedly where lady kima has been held should she still  laura by king murghol  matt by king murghol  murghol and queen ulara  liam from our vantage point can we see the two lava flows  that we were warned about  matt it is way too far away  that stronghold is probably a good mile and a half away  from you right now  laura so there is a lot of cover as we go 
dung	 near it  because of all the…  matt there is a lot of cover yes but it’s a lot  of open area with cover  so it’s one of those you’re just going to have to be careful  as you move through  sam percy  laura it’s pretty dark here right  taliesin yes  sam how long would it take you to make a nuclear weapon  matt yes it’s pretty dark here the only reason  you can see much is because of the low light vision  taliesin a very long time if 
none	 i start it right now  matt even at this radius things you could see nearby  a light source would be very helpful in making sure  that you can see details and not fall in anything you  don’t want to  but it also makes you very visible to anything else out there  so you have to decide  liam between the lava and the red stones the twins can see  correct  because of the dim light  matt you can see near but these are things  that are a mile away  
none	 laura but nothing at a distance  liam right right right  matt it’s way too far away  the reason you can make out this small city and emberhold itself  is because there are clusters of the red glowstone  used within that city and the giant magma fall  that currently envelops the sides of the stronghold  making it very very visible and easy to pick out  against the rest of the cavern  ashley so this is a whole little city down here  liam yes  matt about a mile off yeah  
none	 laura so we should keep to the left and head  down that direction and try to  marisha im actually gonna go ahead and cast  pass without a trace  matt okay  sam whispering what does that do  marisha whispering it makes us really stealthy  sam oh cool  orion its the thing that saved our butts last time  liam it quiets your parts  matt youve seen this before  as she finishes her incantation you feel the darkness  of the shadows around you begin to coalesce  and almost stick to 
none	 you  although theres no substance for a moment you almost  find yourself repulsed by it until you realize  that its probably an advantageous circumstance  but you find yourself now much easier to slip  into the surrounding shadows  marisha theyre nice shadows  travis and im doing my flower girl routine  with the dust of tracelessness  just over here over there put a little on pike  taliesin we dont really need  well  travis what weve got a really large amount  orion you never know percy he does it all 
none	 the time  we dont know how many times its saved us  marisha laughing weve got a really large amount  taliesin i suppose thats fair  sam whats our angle here gents  liam we need to get closer up  we need to find this trap door because its suicide  going in the front  laura right and lady kimas being held here  sam so theres an entrance to this trap door that  possibly is on the outskirts of the city  liam  laura yes  sam so we need to find it 
none	  laura yes its on the left  sam oh its on the left  laura yes so were heading left and going  sam lets do it  liam the twins will creep  continue ahead  ashley yeah you guys real stealthy so  travis yeah keep creeping keep creeping  ashley probably smart that youre moving ahead  matt okay  orion ill take point on the group thats following  matt all right  laura you guys take care of trinket as im ahead of you  ashley come on trinket  travis growling sounds me 
town	 and trinket are telling jokes  in the back of the group  sam quietly  marisha classic trinket  matt all right you guys continue staying off the main path  and you can see there is about a 20foot natural formation  of a walkway or at least where most of the patrols  and any sort of duergar foot travel is localized  you can see where that natural road has been created  over time  you avoid that path and steer off to the left  dodging between the various bits of terrain  and 
none	 its a very rocky and difficult terrain  should you not be with your ranger  who has the underdark as her favored terrain  laura oh ill go back then should i  or is it okay because were all together  matt its okay because you guys are in theory together  im going to say essentially youre just marking places  where the terrain would be dangerous to watch your step  and to be wary of any locations that might be unsafe  for load bearing anything like that  travis yeah i saw that look 
none	  you calling me load bearing  all laugh  matt yes  travis thats honest  matt specific as you guys begin to curve around the left  everyone roll a perception check real fast  sam oh snap  travis prepare for a natural lap  orion with our proficiency bonus  matt only if youre proficient with perception  sam i cant read the dice  its either a 6 or a 9 no idea  orion 15  matt is there a dot on the bottom  sam oh thats the bottom  matt yeah  
none	 sam its a 6  all laugh  ashley oh scanlan  marisha 16  orion 15  taliesin 24  travis 9  ashley 19  laura 20  liam 25  matt all right both percy and vax simultaneously  put their arms out to hold everyone back as you instinctively  liam dtdtdt  matt you hear a slight distant clanking of metal and voices  low kind of conversational voices  too far for you to listen at this point  but you guys immediately stop everyone  and you can just see over maybe a 
none	 good 70 80 feet  from your distance heading up the path you guys  had just began to skirt around  a small what looks like a roving patrol of duergar  probably the ones that go up and down the tunnel  laura i can ambush them  sam ambush them  laura yeah yeah yeah  taliesin whispering let them pass  sam why dont we create a distraction and get rid of them  laura well okay but i can  whispering i can be really quiet  i can do hide in plain sight now 
none	  so i could completely hide myself standing there  sam how many are there are you gonna kill  matt no ones seen them you can just hear them  no ones gone to check  laura oh can i look  liam yes lets go look  matt you can  laura okay lets look  liam lets go catch one  marisha quietly can we not just hide  matt just the two of you  orion how far away are we from them  like in distance  matt right now youre guessing about 80 to 
none	 70 feet  but closing fast  not closing directly on you because theyre doing  a slightly different path  laura whispering everybody stay quiet  taliesin theyre taking the path that were not on right  matt correct  taliesin so if we hide  laura they wont find us  taliesin they wont find us  laura potentially  orion and they can just pass  laura but i want to hear what theyre saying  matt okay so all of you guys whos  marisha well all hide i go ahead and cast  guidance on 
none	 vax  laura what does that mean  liam vex  matt is that a concentration spell  laura im vex hes vax  we look alike its understandable  matt just checking if it’s concentration or not  because that will definitely break your other spell  ill pull it up here real fast  laura oh no then dont keep pass without a trace  travis well we could just get this party started right here if we want to  marisha let me see it might just be  matt guidance is concentration  marisha no sorry 
town	 you dont have my guidance  laura thats okay that’s okay  marisha no guidance here  liam why dont we go just up ahead and scout  laura just a little bit ahead and see what we can see  matt okay so the two of you kind of work up  as the rest of you are holding back  the twins slink between the various rock formations  and strange jagged spires that are currently  peppering this entire underground landscape  you get up to a point where youre maybe 10 feet  from the road 
none	 and with your backs against the rock  you can begin to see the roving band slowly move around  sam whispering band  matt the band of duergar  you count at quick glance roughly 12 to 15  marisha oh yeah  matt armed with hammers halberds um  both of you guys roll a perception check right now  liam perception check  matt perception check specific for this one  liam 26  laura 17  matt you make out that one of them holds no weapons  instead is dressed in  laura wait no 
none	 i get advantage on perception  because im in my favored terrain  matt there you go  liam i already perceived it  laura oh yeah never mind okay  all laugh  matt you can also perceive i suppose  orion whispering i already perceived it  matt one of the duergar walking alongside is  completely bald on top with this extremely long  well sculpted black goatee beard that streams down  thick black and red trimmed robes  carries no weapons and looks extremely dangerous  however as youre listening to the conversation  you 
none	 specifically being able to understand  undercommon  laura yes  liam what is he saying  laura hold on  matt you pick up bits and pieces as they begin to pass by  you hold your breath hoping nobody notices you  and so far so good  they begin to walk slowly past the rock you guys are against  you overhear one of them say  “well keep your eyes peeled eh that thing is still out there”  and the other one slaps him and says  “horek says that it ate a whole scouting 
none	 party in seconds”  another one goes  “listening to horek was your first mistake  “shut up and keep walking”  and they all keep pushing at which point the same  scared one from before says  “i mean if that one went crazy well  “cant the other ones crack too  “i dont know if i feel safe around any of kvarns pets  anymore at this rate”  and by that point they begin to slowly move past  and their voices begin to fade  as they continue up the path you guys just 
none	 traversed down  laura gasps  matt up to the lava tunnels  laura oh shit  travis good thing i was clearing our footprints  all laugh  matt its actually a very good thing  sam its a win for grog  travis highpitched voice is it  did i do something good  liam good job dummy  marisha laughing did i do something good  matt you guys have like  bear tracks and a giant goliath like what laughs  orion these are amazing  marisha what are they  laura fried banana  marisha 
none	 oh thats fun  matt fried bananas toss me one of those  is that from the chat  sam youre working you dont have time to eat  zac off screen yes the chat room  matt  laura thank you chatroom  marisha thank you orion thanks so much  matt i know its not a piece of pizza guys  but ill do what i can  all laugh  sam next time sushi sushi  zac off screen instajur and somebody who didnt  put their name on it  matt disappointed oh  orion instajur 
none	 and mystery guy thanks  zac coleson sent the pizza  all thank you  ashley oh my god thats so good  matt the sound of the duergar walking eventually fades  and you feel pretty confident that  youre safe to return to the rest of the party  laura okay so we walk back  so apparently number one big party  we dont want to fight them if we dont have to  secondly theres some weirdo creature thats gotten loose  and is very very bad and its killed multiple duergar already  liam quickly 
none	  laura that might be the thing  sam no indication of what kind of a creature it was  laura no but it might be the thing we already killed  it couldve been the thing with the plate that  showed up in the camp i dont know  sam the thing with the plate  ashley the thing in the red rider wagon travis the bullet the bullet  laura the big thing  travis bulette marisha bulé  sam oh laura it couldve been that im not sure  travis its a french dog  marisha 
none	 it’s french yeah  laura regardless we should be very careful  traveling forward  taliesin ive seen your sheet you dont speak french  sam we could use that to our advantage  orion we could we could  we could scare them off quite easily  marisha i had a grandmother who did okay  laura i like the way you think all right  orion i can make funny sounds  laura should we keep moving forward  at a very stealthy sort of pace  orion waka waka  matt certainly  taliesin the stealthy mix 
none	  matt you guys push forward keeping that wide  kind of left curve which adds a fair amount of time  to your travel as youre being careful and moving  at a very very heavy circular arc around the duergar city  sam im looking for doors and stuff as we go i dont know why  matt sure looking for doors  sam well theres a trap door somewhere right  orion old man voice there’s doors in them there caves  matt good thinking  liam thatll be the fortress maybe but  laura possibly could 
none	 be farther can we see  the molten things that he was talking about  the lava flows  matt still too far away  laura still too far away  matt as you begin to make your way around  youre just starting to get to the point where you can see  the front of the fortress and you can see where  the magma fall splits and just coalesces around  each side of the stronghold  almost like a blanket waterfall on each side  it does split up at certain points you can begin to 
none	 start  making it out  taliesin where does the magma runoff lead to  does it just pour out does it fill a moat  matt its hard to tell from this distance unfortunately  youd have to get closer up to see  about an hour of travel around the side  laura oh wow  liam i’m so bored  laura laughs dont say that  matt laughs that can be fixed liam  all laugh  taliesin if only there were a way to just speed up  this exposition somehow  travis of all the 
none	 things matt indeed  taliesin life isnt like that  orion wow percy  taliesin sorry  all laugh  laura whispering be quiet  matt its at this point immediately catching your eye vex  one of the nearby obsidian spires is a different  color than the rest  the rest are like a deep black glass shiny color  this one is a dull crimson  laura ooh we should go towards that one  sam because its a different color  liam lets go check it out  marisha wait what was the first color  
none	 i was still laughing at percy what  liam just eat your banana the twins  will go check it out  matt black obsidian this was red  marisha laughing red okay  matt crimson ruddy anyway  taliesin do you not know anything  liam the twins are gonna go have a peek  matt okay  sam im coming with  matt scanlan comes with go ahead and roll a stealth check  sam oh boy laughs  taliesin im not coming with  sam not my strong suit  travis dont fuck it up  laura 
none	 no scanlan what did you do  liam you dick  travis did you  marisha what did you do  all laugh  orion you can change your mind  ashley wait wait i go and  sam ive got advantage dont i  ashley i grab scanlan and i kiss him on the cheek  and make him stay  all gasp and exclaim  orion what  taliesin way to take one for the team  orion oh no  travis i dont know  liam you just stopped him from farting into his flute  ashley 
none	 persuasion that would be  orion ladies and gentlemen this is a huge moment  marisha can you roll a persuasion against a critical fail  can you can you persuade a crit fail  laura can you persuade the dm  ashley wait is it a fail  marisha laughing can you persuade the dm  ashley it is a 1  matt okay so it was a 1  sam it was a 1 liam thats a 1 face  all laugh  liam thats a 1 face  matt i will say pike roll a perception check 
none	  orion d20  laura come on come on d20  ashley perception  liam yes d20 uh thats a half a d20  ashley 14  laura soft high voice no no yes 14  all laugh  sam i dont know  laura ill stop  matt unfortunately youre not quite perceptive enough  to notice scanlans not quite so quiet walking away  as youre distracted by the surroundings  and the circumstance locally  you continue up with the twins  absentmindedly humming to yourself  sam sings softly  matt the twins being used to 
none	 your humming  for some reason it doesnt connect  you make your way up to the spire  at about 15 20 feet out you notice  the coloration is different because it is completely coated  in what looks like dried blood of some kind  liam fuck  laura gasps oh god  matt and immediately to the right of it along the ground  orion so grossed out  matt currently your vision is obscured by another  large kind of twisted stalactite but there appears to be  an arm and a whole bunch more 
none	 dried blood  across the ground just out of view  laura gasps stop can we stop can we stop  matt you can stop  marisha an arm  laura scanlan shh  sam what what  laura whispering youre singing  sam i was singing whispering i was singing  i didnt even know its a force of habit  liam im going to see if i can see anything in the area  that has done this recently  laura is the arm attached to whatever did  matt make an investigation check  liam investigation check 
none	  laura is the arm part of a dead thing or is it alive  matt its on the ground  travis im pretty sure whatever it is its dead  liam 7  matt 7  laura can i check it out as well i mean im there  i might as well  matt you can also attempt to make an investigation check  liam clever there you go  laura wait im doing advantage too just in case  okay that ones better  liam oh i can get advantage  sam you get advantage on investigation 
none	  laura no i got it because im fucking  in my favored terrain  all laugh  laura 21  marisha you walk up in this terrain  matt the state of the blood that you see around  seems to indicate that this has transpired over some time  youre guessing probably within a few days if not a week  since this happened  liam im picking up one of the arms  laura gasps  liam to bring back to the group  matt okay so as you walk up towards the arm to grab it 
none	  you have more of a view of whats happened  and what you see before you are definitely remnants  of some battle long past  laura this is the skelly pile  matt against these rocky formations theres  dried blood everywhere  liam not pretty  matt this terrible bloodbath whatever this event was  it was probably a horrible thing to see  there are pieces of duergar flung about  and i say pieces  the only reason you know duergar  were there is because occasionally you see  part of a head or 
none	 part of a foot  and you recognize the ashy skin from the areas  that arent currently caked with its own gore  liam gagging sounds  matt from what you can tell because of  your investigation check  the remains are torn apart by no blade  theres no cuts theres no clean wounds  theyre either pulled apart by force  travis yeah  matt like arms and limbs were wrenched from the body  just out of sheer power  travis like a wookiee  matt or there appears to be some sort of gnawing 
none	  some chewing like toothy fangs sharp teeth  have partially eaten portions of these bodies  liam this is the work of a beaver  laura yes definitely a very large beaver  orion a busy beaver  sam i think its suicide  all laugh  laura based on tracking and everything and insight  can we tell if that creature is anywhere nearby  or if its gone  orion i think it might be foul play actually  matt from what you can tell  liam it happened in the past  matt yeah it happened 
none	 quite some time ago  looking at the tracks you can see duergar feet  you can see other creatures that resemble  those hook horrors that you encountered earlier  during the lava pool  however theres a series of tracks that you havent seen  well there is very erratic footsteps that look human size  but they seem to be placed randomly  like one foot here one foot here one foot here  laura gasps its that big creature that  it was like one of those things that that thing put together like  matt 
none	 and you see what seem like strange strikes  through the sand like someone had been dragged  very quickly in a very localized spot scattered all about  liam its a human centipede  sam it is its a human centipede  matt its a very strange pattern that you cant  really grasp what kind of creature would make it  laura and it seems like it was here recently or a while ago  matt best you can tell the last time it was here was  about two or three days ago to feast on more 
none	 of the remains  liam human human footprints  laura should we get out of here  matt human sized  liam human sized  travis or set a trap  laura we could try to set a trap or we could  look and see if we can loot anything  is there anything to loot  does it look like anything shiny  matt any semblance of armor that belonged to any  of these individuals is in such tatters that its unusable  you do manage to find across some of the body parts  a couple 
none	 of bloodsoaked gold coin purses  laura okay  marisha take it laura i like gold  matt one of them contains a handful of gems  laura ooh  marisha gems  matt yes those right there so you can mark that down  until you get a chance to appraise them  liam i dont think we want to tangle with this  what are we trying to prove  lets just keep trucking  sam im really bad at stealthing we should go  all laugh  sam we should leave  liam also put the accordion 
tavern	 back  in the bag all right  sam was i doing that its force of habit i dont  its like breathing  liam yeah were going to go back to the group  im going to bring the arm  travis i take out the cask of ale and pour  a little tankard of ale just because im bored  ashley have a sip sip  matt good man well done its very tasty  travis would anyone else like a sip keyleth  matt having been underground for what probably amounts  now to four or 
tavern	 five days that little  taste of ale on your lips  is a very welcoming and very refreshing sensation  travis its good shit right  ashley oh delicious oh no im drunk just kidding  all laugh  ashley that was fast just kidding  liam when we get back to the group  im going to toss the arm to grog  matt grog you instinctively reach up and catch it  you look down and see what looks like  a duergar arm that has been very heavily mangled  travis oh thanks for the hand 
none	  all laugh  liam its a back scratcher  orion that was clever grog  laura well we killed a lot of duergar this time  travis dont negative anything it was a good joke  all laugh  matt it was a good joke i considered it but no  travis have mercy  orion that was a good joke  laura theres a big centipedey  human creepy creature  thats killed a lot of things and we should probably  avoid that at all costs  orion i would agree with that  liam if we 
none	 have to we will but  taliesin that seems fair  laura can we avoid that and still  head left of the keep  matt you havent seen a creature  sam wait we didnt make it into the   was there a structure that we could have entered  laura thats where were going  liam  matt youre heading towards that structure  sam okay but i mean where we just were  orion the magma fortress  matt where you just were no theres just all these  giant rocky spires jutting out of the 
none	 ground  liam spike coated in dried blood  sam they didnt have doors in them  laura should we probably have looked for like a nest  matt there were no doors  sam okay good im looking for a door  liam no we should just keep going  if were going to run into it were going to run into it  lets not find it  laura yeah  matt it appears like there was at one point in time  some very intense seismic activity in this area that  created this cavern and whatever 
none	 is the source  of a lot of this perpetually flowing molten rock  thats why the entire terrain here is so dangerous and uninviting  is because of the sheer force that went into its creation  sam okay  laura so we should just keep freaking being careful  and keep going towards the giant thing  sam okay lets go  ashley keep trucking on  sam pike i have this weird feeling  like you wanted to make out with me  is that something that happened  am i dreaming  ashley well you just 
none	 you know you werent paying attention  sam really  laura and that makes you want to  make out with him  ashley no i think you were moving  along to try to go stealth  and sometimes you should just stay  put and see what happens  all laugh  orion well said cleric  liam that was the most adorable diss in history  all laugh  taliesin that was cold  sam all right  orion yet inviting  travis its all right scanlan  well go pay for it later  all laugh 
none	  matt a small hit to scanlans morale  but the party marches on  liam you lose an inspiration die  all laugh  travis disadvantage on whatever roll  sam i deserved it i deserved it  liam okay twins in front here we go  laura lets keep going  matt twins in front you guys  continue to push forward  for the sake of the length of this journey  im going to have the party go ahead and  roll a communal stealth check once more  marisha i still have pass without a 
none	 trace up  taliesin oh for the love of god  marisha which gives everyone a plus 10  laura oh really  matt yes  liam percy dont bang the guns together  taliesin yeah that happened too  orion 24  matt 24  sam 19  liam we all have plus 10  matt yes  laura and this is plus 10 already  sam yes  taliesin i rolled a 1  matt okay  all groan  laura oh percy  sam i kiss percy  all laugh  taliesin what ah  sam i

town	 that bit is key a one is two failures  laura oh no  ashley im not stealthy man  marisha a one is two failures  matt a one is considered two failures for this challenge  pushing forward  taliesin now you roll well  matt you manage to stop percy and find out  the root of this audio problem  pushing forward you manage to make your way  about a quarter mile on the outskirts of this cluster of buildings  curving far left youre just managing to keep out of the city proper  
none	 and move straight towards the very back wall of this cavern  which is buttressed against   what this fortress is built against  so youre circumventing the city to go  straight to this fortress  as youre moving about a quarter mile  from the stronghold  vex you pick up a strange person  standing maybe about 50 60 feet ahead of you  laura just a person  matt just a person it looks like  laura  orion worried laughter  laura can they see us does it look like they can see us 
dung	  matt you take a moment keeping an eye out  and the person isnt moving just standing right there  laura whispering so theres a person standing right there  marisha whispering what  laura whispering a person hes just standing there  matt its too dark to make out any details unfortunately  laura no hmm  sam could be good could be bad  we have no idea  liam can i see him now that shes  pointed him out to me  sam i can hold him might piss him off  travis at least 
none	 do the hold  matt you can see it  and there is a humanoid standing on its own  liam it doesnt seem to be moving though  laura maybe its a scarecrow liam maybe its a statue  laura yeah thats what i mean  travis a statue  sam want me to go check it out  liam no i don’t  laura cant you go invisible  sam yes i can go invisible  laura go invisible and check it out  sam i polymorph and turn into a fly and i buzz over  marisha 
none	 oh yay thats fun  liam good job gnome nuts  laura oh no if hes magic hes going to know  sam its all right ive got magic too  matt you approach this individual and  notice it is unmoving  and is of a singular solid color  laura whispering its a statue  matt what looks to be what is an illithid  or a mind flayer  is currently locked in some sort of reactionary position  but is completely turned to stone  laura oh no  marisha oh shit  sam like a 
none	 medusa type of a thing  liam we faced basilisks once and they did this to vexahlia  travis weve got basilisk eggs  marisha theres a lot of things that can do this  actually to be fair  laura we do have basilisk eggs in the bag of holding  travis yeah we’ve got eight of them  maybe we should crack one on statue guy  sam i buzz back to the group buzzing  laura oh whats that oh its scanlan  sam i kind of fuck with tiberiuss ear a little bit  all laugh 
none	  orion oh scanlan stop it  sam and i turn back  all laugh  travis well what did you see  laura what was it  sam a crazy statue of a crazy illithid  liam thats crazy  laura can we look at clarota and say  “do you know anything about this”  matt clarota kind of thinks for a second and goes  breathy raspy voice “as far as ive noticed occasionally  “these patrols do walk with a lizard creature that  has this ability  “its generally used as a threatening device  
none	 “or a guardian amongst the city”  marisha oh so the duergar  laura have basilisks  marisha have this as like their pets  matt “a trained beast yes”  liam why do you suppose they used it  on one of their own  matt “i can only imagine maybe this transpired  “before the union and is left as a warning”  liam so its a duergar pet  laura do we remember how to take care of basilisks  like do we not look at them is that how they dont  liam dont look at 
none	 them thats correct  laura dont look them in the eye or dont look at their face  liam yes thats it its a vision thing  laura yes taliesin yes i believe its vision based  laura okay  matt this would be a nature check  taliesin double check  matt for anyone who wishes to make one  marisha ill do that  travis me too  all laugh  taliesin 23 natural 20  laura oh well never mind hes got it  orion very good yay  marisha oh well ill stop there  travis 
none	 just go ahead and dunk on everybody  why dont you  matt natural 20  essentially it is a sightbased circumstance  taliesin its entirely visual they have to catch your gaze  and then that is how they can turn you into stone  otherwise as long as you dont catch their gaze youll be fine  laura all right  liam all right its a good thing weve all been watching  daredevil last week  travis so look them in the eye got it  all laugh  taliesin yes very helpful  travis lets go

none	 slightly for a second  raspy breathy voice “aye weve met  “not the kindest of my people but nevertheless  “should all this pass i would like to maybe  “release him from this stony prison”  laura so you know how to do that  matt “i know not but it can be done ive seen it”  laura didnt we do that  orion yes  laura didnt we have to do that  liam we sprinkled some of its blood on your eyes  if i remember correctly  orion yes  laura i turned to

none	 the large magma fall  that is pouring over the top of the fortresss second story  and completely encompasses that side  it splits and divides towards the center   a larger fall towards the front of the fortress  and a thinner one towards the very back  laura whispering thin one thin one  travis yeah lets go towards the door  liam all right creeping back  laura yeah creepy creepy creepy towards the thin one  liam the creeps are creeping  matt okay  liam were in stealth still or  travis yeah

none	 see where  portions of the stone have been  gradually worn and melted  by just the contact but then built upon by  more and more cooled rock  this is a very weird clustered  framing of cooled rock around this fall  you see no doorway as the actual magma is pressing  directly against the side of the stronghold  liam right i want to see if i can tell if anything   i know this all looks natural but perhaps  something is fashioned to look such  i want to see if 
none	 i can figure that out  matt okay go ahead and make an investigate check  liam uh lalalala 18  matt 18 best that you can find looking around  you cannot see anything before you any sort of mechanism  any sort of any button any sort of lever or additional doorway  its just a solid wall with the two magma flows  liam all right i double back for the underdark expert  and i bring my sister up  laura right right right can i come up and look and  see if i can 
none	 see any tracking  if theres any footprints around a certain area around this  liam see if you can find a false door or something  laura yeah  matt all right go ahead and make an investigate check  liam do it do it  marisha wait i thought it was behind  liam no  laura its okay no no no i get an advantage  liam it was a 1  laura shush  liam all right thats not a 1  marisha laughs laura is it investigation  liam yes  laura 22  matt 
none	 okay looking at this the side of this fortress  you can see what amounts to a very very slight raise  in the smooth flow of magma it seems to pour down  most of the stronghold and then slightly bulge out  and then it pools and you can now have a better  closer so you see where it runs off to  it continues into a stream following the edge  of the giant cavern wall thats curving down  and to the left into a far deeper cavern  you can see the entire cavern 
none	 almost like a giant u  its open and the entire thing banks around it and goes  deeper still you guys have made it to the far back wall  laura gasps sighs  matt ah the chicken has arrived  sam laughs metaphorically  matt metaphorically and actually  but from what you can see  there is a slight raise beneath the magma  laura okay does it look like its safe to bring  everybody up here or does it seem like  anythings around that could see us  anything looking from above  matt 
none	 you glance up and you can see there are two duergar  perched up on the edge of the first floor right on the parapet  you can see theres all this jagged obsidian stone  almost teeth sticking out of the very top edge of the wall  and you see the patrols just walking keeping an eye out  they have crossbows on their arms  a couple of others just have javelins at the side  and theyre just doing slow patrols  laura okay  sam we need to 007  laura were going to have 
none	 to be super  sam were going to have to 007 sniper them out  laura yeah  marisha i can handle this i think  laura you can  marisha i think i can get us into that trap door  sam i think youre right  laura do you have something that can  pull it towards you  sam no no no can you redirect the magma flow around  that bulge with your  cant you move rocks or  marisha i can  sam so you can create a like a little lip for it 
none	 to go around  laura ooh  marisha i was thinking i could either do   thats not a bad idea or i could   thats actually not a bad idea  all laugh  matt singing thats fucking teamwork  all laugh  marisha or i could or i was thinking i could cool off  the magma and we could break it  laura oh yeah maybe you can move  it away and then cool it  liam that sounds kind of noisy  marisha well  sam first we’ve got to take care of 
none	 the guys on the roof  are they back with us or are they still stealthing in front  matt theyre still stealthing in front and you guys have  come back to the group  laura yeah i guess we came back to the group  and told them about whats going on  sam okay we can  me and pike  can take out  the guys on the roof  laura oh really  travis yeah do it ashley you want to give it a go  laura wait but hes got sneak attack  liam

none	  matt all right  sam so i will take pike  liam portal motherfucker  matt you reach over and hold on to pike gently  give her a little wink and suddenly  sam were going to try to appear between the two of them  exactly between the two of them  matt okay you feel the sudden rush of air and  the surrounding atmosphere of you goes from  that uncomfortable warmth to a sudden freezing cold  as your vision goes black and all you can see  is scanlan looking at you with 
none	 this heightened grin  as hes muttering these arcane incantations under his breath  an instant later you guys are both standing at the top  of the wall with both of the duergar  one kind of facing away one looking really surprised  at the fact that you guys both appeared there  you have a surprise round what are you doing  sam i cast thunderwave and blast out from where  im standing between them 15 feet in either direction  laura whispering thats so loud  marisha isnt that loud  sam so 10 feet 
none	 and 10 feet away from me  matt okay whats your save  sam uh 19  liam but a quiet thunderwave right  matt 19 all right  laura a really quiet thunderwave  orion thunderclap is loud thunderwave is different  laura oh okay  marisha but im pretty sure its still thunder  matt thunderwave looking it up real fast just to  make sure of the situation  travis i like this plan  orion thunder makes a noise right  liam singing this is a triumph  ashley singing im making a note here

none	 matt so as you guys appear you release pike  you bring your arms up and slam your arms  in a downward motion as you do there is  a dull flash of light and a boom noise  burst sound emanates from you  orion i say “ooh light”  matt both of the duergar the one who sees you  who is bringing us his crossbow to fire  gets impacted and blown off the side of the wall  the one facing away gets blown up towards  slams into the side of the wall right 
none	 at the edge  and then topples over the side both plummeting over  liam wilhelm scream  ashley oh  matt brief wilhelm scream youre standing there  you watch this happen  ashley i didnt have to do anything scanlan  sam make out with me  all laugh  sam we’re alone it’s super romantic  i just killed two fuckers  come on it’s now or never baby  travis singing i think we’re alone now  ashley  travis singing doesn’t seem to be anyone around  all laugh  ashley well let’s just wait

none	 liam come on grog  travis i rage  all laugh  matt there’s one that lands just to the side of the  magma pool that’s forming  he took some damage and is like pained gasps  trying to get back up he fell hard on one arm  the other one that’s further away from the magma  the one that saw you managed to reduce his damage  a little bit because it was aware at least you were there  sam we have to kill these fuckers  matt looks like it took some damage 
none	 but not too much  it’s maybe 10 feet from you  travis eager laugh  matt as he’s trying to get back up he looks up and sees you charging towards him grog raging  go ahead and make your two attacks  laura yes  travis roars 19  matt 19 hits  travis nice and 19 again  matt both hit go ahead and roll damage  liam i’m going to get some duergar  travis 17 and 19  matt so as he gets up grunt he goes back for  his warhammer  before he 
none	 gets a chance to you cleave off one arm  and send the axe right into the center of his torso  silencing him in an instant  he slightly spreads at the wound choking sound  this gurgling sound and you just have to kick him  off the edge of your axe  travis i tilt him towards the pillar to spray  the pillar with his gore  look i can make one too ha ha  all laugh  marisha i run across to the other one and thorn whip  him from across the lava 
none	 pool  matt you have to jump over the lava to do that because  he’s on the side you guys are on  marisha oh well then is there anyone on the other side  ashley is he already dying or no he’s in the lava  marisha he’s on the same side as me  matt he’s on the same side as you sam he’s hurt  laura we run up and kick him into the lava marisha is he standing up oryeah  matt he’s in the process of standing up yeah laura can we just run 
none	 up and kick him into the lava  marisha yeah can i just run and push  matt laughs okay all right so…  liam i use pushing attack  travis grunts hunh marisha grunts hunh  sam high voice i’m sorry  marisha laughing yes exactly  all laugh  matt all right so go ahead and roll athletics  marisha this is the meanest thing i’ve ever done  liam  matt laugh  laura no no remember you killed that kid one time  marisha oh thanks for bringing that up vax  all laugh  laura 
dung	 i’m vex he’s vax  travis that’s some dark shit that’s some dark shit  marisha oh i thought it was vex and vax  every time i get confused  matt laughing it’s a long story  ashley oh my god remember you killed  that kid one time  liam two and a half years in and keyleth  has just learned our names  marisha i get them confused  sam i do too all the time  several all the time  marisha see no one else has any idea  orion i have your names 
none	 written down  liam i’m vex okay it’s simple  sam no no that is not true  laura no no don’t do that he’s lying  marisha laughing two years and i just don’t  matt so as the terrible blood spray occurs across the  nearby pillar on grog’s side the other duergar is getting up  with his crossbow trying to get it ready  you rush forward  go ahead and roll athletics  marisha oh  ashley come on  laura oh no  orion as she does this i notice  everything and i 
none	 sit down  marisha this is for that kid  orion and turn to the next chapter in my book  matt okay  liam singing he had it coming he had it coming  ashley this is quite a good read  marisha it could be worse 14  matt that’s okay he rolled a 1  laura ooh yes  matt so as the duergar is getting up he goes  grunt  you just run up and  boom  and he falls back  hissing sfx screams   and starts giving a horrible painful scream 
none	 as he’s  essentially flailing in the magma melting  ashley someone shoot him in the mouth  marisha i say shh shh shh and i wind down  to push him under the lava  ashley oh this is brutal  orion that’s not what it’s called  matt okay so as he’s screaming your wind wall shoves  him further under the magma as he’s screaming  cooling the magma around him as the rock cracking sfx  cracks around him turning into black rock  marisha i’m sorry i’m sorry  matt his face still visible over 
none	 the surface  going choking sfx  in this horrible almost hanincarbonite type of look  at the top of the magma pool  laura keyleth  liam you just oneupped grog man  travis that was awesome  matt as fresh magma now begins to pool over the cool  covering his face you step away  sam piss on the body  travis i never knew you were an artist  marisha laughs nervously  matt however the subtle sound of the thunderwave  and then the horrible screams of pain  you can hear footsteps coming toward 
none	 the wall edge  where both you and pike are currently on  what are you going to do  laura run or can you turn yourselves into duergar  sam is there a door or something  matt not from your current position no  you’re just on a five foot ledge of the second story  sam of the fortress oh it’s not a standalone  tower it’s part of a larger wall  ashley how far of a jump down is it  matt it’s about 25 feet  laura what am i too excited about it 
none	  turn yourself into a duergar make it seem  like everything’s okay  ashley should we call grog  sam no i’ll do the same thing to get us down  ashley oh yeah dimension door  sam unless you want to stay and fight  matt you’ve got 20 seconds  marisha wait what’s happening  ashley we could try to stay and fight  liam turn into a duergar cawing sounds  laura turn into a duergar act like you’re a duergar  say everything’s okay  ashley turn into a duergar  sam should we get 
none	 out of here  ashley yeah let’s get out  sam okay we’re going to dimension door out  matt okay so you grab her magic sfx  back down to the bottom  travis cast that shit  matt they reappear at the bottom  orion are you done  marisha okay i cast wall of stone but right  over top of where i see that lip  but i dont want to bring it out far just like halfsies  sam laughs just the tip  marisha just the tip  ashley does it stop the magma 
none	  matt as you guys appear at the bottom  marisha so it goes like magma flow heres the wall  i want it to go  grinding noise  matt you guys hear footprints along the wall  they dont seem to have seen you yet  at which point theres this grinding and thump sounds sound of shifting rock  a giant stone wall juts out the side of the fortress  right where the lava pool was pouring over the side  as it does the lava pools on top of the wall  and is offset 
none	 leaving a small gap  where you guys can try to squeeze through  you can see right underneath where it was  there is a stone doorway  it does not appear to have a handle or anything  its just a stone door  sam how do we get in  liam tiberius fly up there quick  orion what  liam stop eating chicken and fly up to that door  orion oh  ashley where did you get that chicken  orion whats going on  liam theres a magic doorway up there i dont see 
none	  any handles or anything  matt its right underneath the lava  liam oh it’s on the ground  matt basically she put the stone wall out it pours off  orion its right there what are you talking about  liam i walk up to it and take a look  laura oh yeah that was good maybe grog can push it  orion im going to do an arcana check  liam do i have advantage  matt uh no  laura can grog push it  liam all right take a look dude  travis no 
none	 hes doing an arcana check  sam grog just kill it  marisha laughing go kill it just punch the door  orion 22  matt 22 as you guys are inspecting this  in the time youve taken to do this  both the duergar up on top have seen you  and are both taking shots at you  sam oh shit  taliesin i was waiting for that anyways  so im going to  marisha he was waiting  matt as they appear on the top you guys who have  your arrow and gun at 
none	 the ready  both take a shot then they get a retribution shot  liam keyleth  marisha what  liam lets go up  marisha go up  liam up to them quick  marisha i want see how they fare  liam that’s going to be about 6 seconds  matt the door is not magical it is a mechanism of some kind  laura 65 oh 65 laughter shit  sam i rolled a 65  liam 65 holy shit youre a deity  laura im amazing  orion vax pay attention the door mechanical  it 
none	 is not magical thats how we open it  laura 25  matt 25 percy and you get 2 attacks each  so  zipping sfx  taliesin i hit a 23  matt 23 hits go ahead and roll second attack  taliesin okay roll damage  matt well roll both attacks first  laura 18 for the second one  matt hits as well  taliesin i have to reload with my second attack  matt oh right is this with the bad news  taliesin ive got the big gun out  matt you’ve got the bad 
none	 news out okay then  yeah so you fire and then reload  go ahead and roll damage  laura im using my fire bow  matt youre using the fire bowstring as you nock  your first arrow swoosh sound it bursts into flame  as it hits your fingers  taliesin oh my god  marisha dejected groan  taliesin 7 damage  matt 7 damage okay  taliesin im so embarrassed  matt im sorry  liam gunshot sound you got me right in the ear  laura 20 damage on the first attack  matt okay 
none	  marisha come on vex  laura 13 on the second  matt okay as both are going up with their crossbows  ready to go first one bad news  gunshot sound   with a cacophonous echoing gunshot  that within this cavern  definitely carries some sound to it  and to some degree suprise may be a  little harder to find going forward  taliesin they were ready to start shooting at us  matt however the shot hits the guy in the shoulder knocks him off balance for a second  not enough of 
none	 a wound to prevent his next action  you however place one arrow into  the other guy’s shoulder  hes dropped the crossbow as he goes to reach for his  other weapon the other one just  right at the bottom of his throat out the back of his head and he just drops below the wall  ashley awesome  matt the other one does get a crossbow  shot off at you percy  that is a 23 versus armor class  taliesin that hits  matt you take 9 points of piercing damage  as 
none	 the bolt just streaks you across  the front of your torso  passes through thankfully but you do feel there is  a wound that’s slowly turning warmer  beneath your armor  laura can i shoot at the other one  matt thats been the round  now you guys have been inspecting the door  the door is not magical there is some sort of contraption  that opens it from the inside  liam i’m getting my picks out seeing if i  can figure out some way to  matt go ahead and make a 
none	 check with your thieves’ tools  liam 29  matt a 29 you take a second and you find that the contraption  that holds this door in place definitely is on the other side  its a series of winches and a chain pull  you find that there is one slight gap where you manage  to hook one of the chains pull it out ever so slightly  and you know with a strong yank from a strong person  you could probably pull it out from the outside  orion grog travis sounds like we need 
none	 a strong person  liam so this is the part where i ask grog over to pull  grog grab this  ashley ill do it ill do it  all laugh  travis yeah me and pike are on this  ashley ill assist  matt grog you reach over and grab the chain and pike  grabs onto the back of you and you both pull  travis give it a good heaveho  matt go ahead and make a strength  check with advantage  travis oh yeah 23  matt 23 as you pull you hear 
none	 the grinding of this chain  against the stone cracking sfx  and you can see the actual door begin to  rise upward this way  sam its a delorean  matt essentially when it opens up it moves  the magma out of the way  thats how this construct is used as an exit its what i mentioned before  this is supposed to be an exit for the royal individuals  of the stronghold  it only opens part way however because the stone wall  currently blocks the rest of its movement  however you 
none	 can still move through it  liam we cant leave this duergar behind though  we gotta take him out  matt yes there is one duergar still there  so thats been all of your guys actions were bringing it back pike you havent gone yet  ashley okay  matt keyleth youve gone so the only one left to  take an action is  marisha tiberius have you gone  matt yeah he checked the doorway  marisha oh right  ashley wheres he at  matt hes up on top of the wall about 25 feet 
none	 from you  ashley i want to create a spiritual weapon  like a poisonous lasso and whiff sfx  and then put him down into the lava  matt huh sure  all laugh  sam a lariat of truth  travis thats awesome  taliesin well all right then  matt so using your spiritual weapon you take a moment  you grasp your sarenrae holy symbol around your neck  and as you pull your hand away from the symbol you see  this glowing celestial rope extends out of nowhere  you begin to spin your 
none	 fingers and on its own  it begins to swirl and swirl  you then throw your hand forward and on its own  it cascades upward toward the edge of the wall  go ahead and roll an attack roll  ashley an attack roll which is  matt using your spell modifier as the attack bonus  ashley 10  sam ooh that aint gonna do it  matt total of 10  ashley i think so  all laugh  matt whatd you roll  ashley i rolled a 2 and then i have a plus 8
