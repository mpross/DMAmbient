town	 zadash seeking opportunities information getting their bearings amongst the  various townsfolk streets and what goingson there are getting updates from town criers  wandering through the roads speaking with individuals going into bathhouses where you met  up with your fantastic longlost barbarian yasha coming in to join alongside you guys in your  exploits you managed to converse with a meeting or at least beau and fjord met with a meeting of  unhappy denizens of the empire discussing their frustrations beneath the leaky tap and had  crossed some information with them you had gone and made 
town	 some purchases you had sold off  a few of the things you had acquired in your journeys northward along the amber road you had decided  to looking for work go to the kings hall where they had a task board there and had taken one of  the contracts that had been posted you would be paid to seek the sewers beneath the city near the  outskirts of the trispire area of the town for something that had been lurking within those  tunnels below a couple of guards had not returned one had gone there and 
none	 fled you were  promised a sum of money should you be able to exterminate whatever this entity is and bring back  proof of its demise you jauntily accepted this before this happened as a part of a journey  towards this trispire both caleb and jester made their way there caleb unsuccessfully entering a  nicer district of the city that did not seem to believe or respect his presentation jester did  so she got a room at one of the hoitytoity inns in the district and was led to some mild  disappointments where we left 
tavern	 off the two of you had reconvened and begun making your way back to  meet up with the rest of your friends at the leaky tap tavern probably at a brief distance from each  other as caleb has huffed off in a bit of frustration eventually caleb you make your way  to the familiar outside of the leaky tap you enter the fresh mud now a little bit less fresh  and dried against your face into the interior at this point its midafternoon theres maybe  about lets say nine patrons in there and a number 
none	 of your friends who have been waiting for  the two of you to return that are all sitting around a table and discussing amongst themselves the rest  of you guys look across and watch caleb enter and then a few moments after jester enters as well  laura oh hi  travis howd you do  marisha big money  laura no not so much not a lot of money  travis lots of gifts then  laura no  marisha jewels  laura no nothing really but i saw the traveler so thats good news everyone hes 
none	 still  around hes here hes probably hanging out  with us right now  travis hes in zadash like staying here  laura yes well probably yes  travis isnt that hard since hes not technically recognized  sam should you be talking about him out in the open like that  laura well not a lot of people know who he is yet so really no i dont think ill get in trouble  sam hes a new god  laura well i dont know if hes new but he is just not wellknown especially here im sure 
none	 where  hes from everybody knows him because hes really cool so i bet a lot of people are like  oh my god i love you  travis he plays lots of local clubs yeah  laura yes basically  travis up and coming enjoying a resurgence  marisha and youre sure hes a god  laura yeah yeah hes really cool hes so powerful you guys should really see what he can  do because its amazing  sam give us a hint  laura well he can do lots of magic and he can appear out of 
none	 nowhere thats cool  sam that is cool  travis were you with anyone when he showed up  laura no  travis do you think hed want to meet us or introduce us maybe  laura i can ask him yeah  marisha yeah im really interested in a god that kicks it with people  travis and laura yeah  marisha ive never heard of that  laura well traveler you heard it yourself if you like everyone here you can just show up anytime  travis perception check  matt make a perception check  travis first 
none	 one thats an 11  matt 11  travis yeah  matt you look around the room and nothing seems to apparate the clientele all seem disinterested  with your presence theres nothing that would belie any arrival of an entity she spoke of  travis whispering i dont think hes here  laura well its possible hes just invisible right now he does that sometimes  travis that is problematic  taliesin incognito  laura yeah  liam i mean it is not totally unheard of the legends in history are full of stories of the gods  dabbling 
none	 with mortals i dont know what happened for you today but it is not common but it does happen  laura yeah it happens  travis well  ashley he shows up to you as a man or how does that work  laura yeah you know hes just this guy i dont know exactly what he looks like because hes got  this hood  travis a hood  laura i imagine that hes really handsome  ashley okay  laura i think hes really cute he sounds really cute he can probably hear me right now im so 
none	  embarrassed  laughter  liam hello guy  laura right maybe hell start talking to you too  marisha maybe molly can do a seance and hell come out  laura oh well he might get you know what he might think thats really fun that could be fun  taliesin i dont normally speak with the dead on a first date but well think about it  travis yasha do you have any kind of communication with your  ashley i mean i certainly dont see him in the flesh so no  sam but do you talk 
none	 to him  ashley yes of course  marisha does he talk back  ashley not exactly  laura maybe you have to get somewhere really quiet because the first time i heard the traveler  it was super duper quiet  ashley thats a good idea actually thats a good idea  laura fjord can i ask you a question  travis yes  laura do you remember how long it took us to get from port damali to the border into  travis i dont think it was more than a few days i dont recall exactly do 
town	 i recall exactly  matt you do from port damali to the southern gates of the empire and the wuyun gorge on foot  which you guys were traveling on foot it took you about the better part of two weeks you passed  through nicodranas or you didnt pass through nicodranas but you went through along the road and  skirted along the side you took the road pretty much straight there but it was quite a bit of  travel on foot to get there  travis by a few days i mean a couple weeks i think 
none	 thats more of an appropriate estimation  laura so wait if i sent a message from alfield then or wait where were we when i sent that message  sam you were in alfield  laura then would it have got to nicodranas and to zadash by now  travis oh yeah jester thats got to take a while to get there and back  liam it would take quite a while longer i think its too early for you to have checked today  marisha we were in alfield because that was also when i stole the mail  
town	 laura okay  liam also sometimes people steal your mail you can get robbed on the road  matt no i believe it was trostenwald  laura no i just had an itch you have a little dirt on your face but other than that  liam shit happens  laura so maybe thats what it is thats why  travis of course now is she supposed to send you stuff here  laura she was going to send it to the pillow trove  travis well have to hang out until it shows up then  laura yeah  
none	 sam it seems like its harder to get over to the pillow trove maybe you could have them forward  your mail to here or something like that  laura it would be a pretty expensive package so i feel like maybe i could do that  sam or if we had some sort of a po box  laura i dont know what it is but ill look into that i have a room there tonight you guys  marisha room party  laura the thing is that apparently its not easy to get into that district  liam 
none	 i was not able to accompany her to the pillow trove  sam and marisha why not  liam because i am shabby  travis youre shabby  taliesin that is fair you are shabby  liam shabbily dressed  laura shabby chic  sam we need to get you some nicer clothes then  liam you know i was thinking on the walk back here that i would probably like to get a cloak of  some kind  marisha you could also get a new jacket and new pants  liam i know where everything is in every 
none	 pocket of this coat it has been with me through a lot what  laura maybe we can go somewhere and they will make a coat exactly like that coat with all the  same pockets only it wont have the holes in it  marisha how long could it take you to memorize pockets on a coat thats like 20 minutes  liam i will probably just get a cloak  laura yeah thats probably good too  ashley should we get you a rag as well just to have on hand like a hanky so you dont have 
none	 to do  a full bath you could just do a quick  liam im not bothered it seems like maybe  sam and taliesin im not bothered  ashley im definitely not bothered  travis yasha makes a good point though just in case a simple wipedown was enough to gain you entry  liam you know water is not very hard to come by so i can  laura or we just keep going to visit that guy who made you clean every day we could go see him and  then he makes us all clean  
none	 marisha you could really just get a new coat  taliesin does feel like a terrible abuse of hospitality  laura what to use his power like that i want to ask the traveler if he knows how to do that  because i wonder if he could make me do that  taliesin is the traveler the only god youve ever seen or have you seen other gods out of curiosity  laura no ive only seen that guy  taliesin so this is the one that decided to make itself presentable to you  laura mmhmm  marisha 
none	 she does see hamster unicorns are they gods  laura no theyre just unicorns  sam weve been sitting drinking right  taliesin ive been drinking  sam weve been plotting our next moves  travis weve got to tackle this job at some point  laura weve got to get to that sewer you guys  travis yeah its a sewer nexus with a beast with webs  marisha so were not having this room party  taliesin were having the room party after the sewers  travis yeah because well have bank and  then we can get 
none	 room service and shit  laura but well have to get clean or else we wont get in there  taliesin i want to defile a very expensive shower  liam thats what im saying is the sewer first because you are all going to be dirty like me  taliesin and somebody elses hotel room will get us clean  ashley if youre renting a room there maybe they have to let us in  marisha you also have to get in in order to rent the room  laura i think they only have to let me in 
none	 technically  travis did they give you a hall pass or something  laura i have this key it says pillow trove on it  travis is it just a key or is there a thing that dangles from it something we could mimic and make  more of  matt its a very intricate key it feels like a dense iron but its been gold leafed or coated  in some sort of reflective goldlike metal its very well made it has little scrawlings on it  almost like a spiral in the center the key itself  travis 
none	 jester can i see it real fast  matt is probably worth a silver in its own right  laura oh yeah beau has it right now  travis oh thank you i take a real good look at it in case i want to fucking minor illusion that  shit later  matt okay good to know  liam also i dont think thats the main issue theyre very strict at the gate for who gets in  and some of us might not have a problem but more than one of us might  marisha caleb why are 
none	 you so hung up on just changing clothes for like ten minutes just to  get through the door  liam it seems more like you are hung up on it than i am  taliesin let a man be eccentric  marisha im just saying you want in dress for what you want  liam thats why i want to pay for a cloak  sam this is your jam  taliesin im a real fan of this one  travis it gets real turnt up when this here starts playing  matt you turn back at the threepiece 
none	 halfelven band that are moseying their way through the  afternoon lazily theyre whispering and chatting amongst each other and ribbing each other with  their elbows between things halfpaying attention to the music but its nice enough to keep atmosphere  taliesin im tossing a silver over just for that  travis a silver  taliesin yeah  travis fucking start small man  taliesin dont tell me how to spend my money  matt as the coin clinks and rolls about two feet off the gentleman standing with this double set  of drums that lays over a 
none	 leather strap on him you can see hes got the shaved sides of his  head this young halfelven boy immediately sees that stops drumming grabs the coin gives you a  nod and goes right back into the song you watch as the other performers all of a sudden  immediately look to you and theyre all like  travis now the beats all off  taliesin what youre hearing is the happiness of a performer  liam are we going to  laughter  matt so hes steve martin in the jerk yeah  laughter  taliesin fuck 
none	 you birdman  laughter  liam two things one fjord will you pass me these cookies over here  travis yeah  liam thank you second of all are we going to try to tackle this sewer this evening or is this  something that were going to do tomorrow  sam what time is it  matt later afternoon  travis ive been looking at some of the folks around here i think theyre overexaggerating the  importance of this beast  liam yeah  travis yeah i think we should at least go down there and take a 
none	 look  liam oh im not opposed to going down there i just mean are we waiting until cover of night or  are we doing this  travis nah i dont think so im not a super fan of the sewer during the day i figure ill like it  even less at night  marisha well why dont we at least go and talk to that guard that came back try and track him  down maybe get a little bit of insight  travis ooh yeah do we know where that guy is  marisha do we 
none	 know where that guy is  matt which guy  travis the guy that came running back  marisha oh or was there a guy that came back  travis that voloshin said that one of them ran back from the task  matt yeah you dont know anything you can go back and try and ask for information on that but  you havent met him or know anything  taliesin i know one thing thats a photosensitive thing if we need to make a fast escape id rather  have some light maybe if its something like that 
none	  travis yeah  taliesin daytimes better for that different environment  travis good thinking  laura so is it better to go now or tomorrow morning  taliesin i dont know  travis and taliesin now  travis how long does it take to get over to the trispire area find us a manhole  matt from where you are now itd take you maybe the better part of 45 minutes better part of an hour  travis is it early afternoon or late afternoon  laura late afternoon you said  matt its late afternoon youre probably about 
dung	 an hour and a half two hours from sundown  travis well be fine  taliesin i say we do it  travis yeah why not  marisha i mean it will be dark after that  taliesin im buzzed and if i have another drink im going to be more than buzzed  marisha oh yeah lets drink and fight thats a good idea  travis were definitely going now  taliesin im right where i want to be i want a 45minute walk to get there  travis hey lets do it youll walk your buzz off  
none	 marisha lets maybe stock up on some torches on the way there nah we dont need torches do we  liam no  marisha not anymore  liam no  travis not with your nerd goggles  marisha yeah  matt do keep in mind and this is my fault too for not keeping track of it but even with  darkvision youre still seeing pretty low light longdistance perception checks without light  youre still at disadvantage on them ive been bad about keeping track of that  liam youve been bad  taliesin we have a light spell 
none	 though dont we  liam yeah thats also dim light though as well its not super bright unless i  taliesin i must have a torch or something  marisha i have one in my adventurers kit  laura you have an adventurers kit  marisha yeah  taliesin i have a tinder box  matt so you can turn things into torches  taliesin i have a hooded lantern  ashley i have a tinder box too i have a torch  matt laughs everyone looks at their equipment suddenly  liam this game is amazing  taliesin i 
none	 have all this stuff in this bag i never opened  matt well all righty whats the plan  laura oh i have an axe now  matt you do you have a handaxe  taliesin youve got a handaxe  laura yay  taliesin have you equipped it  laura yes  taliesin yeah look at that oh wow  travis how about we casually make our way over and as were doing that we can keep an eye out for  kingsguard and see if they know of this guy  marisha copy  matt are you guys 
none	 making your way towards that direction  laura yeah  liam i would like to keep my eye out for a decent clothing shop  matt okay fair enough make an investigation check for you as you guys travel and traverse the city  liam that is 11  matt yeah along the way and keeping an eye out asking a couple questions here and there you  eventually find a very basic clothingwears company nothing fancy but just utility pants  workers shirts gloves and cloaks are available so if you want to buy a cloak you can do 
none	 that  liam i would like to get something that is brown muted nothing gaudy probably dont have that anyway  matt not in this one no your choices are pretty much brown black and gray so youre good  liam ill take the brown one yeah  matt youre good on that one i do not recall if they had any pricing put down for cloaks  liam its 50 gold  matt 600 gold pieces please eh it falls under what would be general common clothes so ill put the  cloak cost at two silver  liam 
none	 okay i have that  taliesin a poor man could buy half a cloak half a cloak between them  travis one of those shitty dueling shawls that they throw off  matt exactly  taliesin i love it  sam actually what season is it are we north is it going to get cold  laura its cold  matt the further north you go yeah this particular area is pretty chilly especially since  youre getting towards the end of fall its almost harvest close in two weeks you guys are  hitting winter in the very near 
none	 future you would know this too that snowfall is fairly  common throughout the winter here  sam can you pick me up earmuffs  liam of course i can do that i ask for the largest size they have and i get a woolen cap as well  matt for both of those together one silver piece  liam yeah okay i have that  ashley are you going to take your ears and roll them  sam that sounds amazing i will do that  travis warren t rat in american tail  marisha two sponge rollers  
town	 matt perfect following that the task board contract that you recovered and was assigned to  you by the herald of the hall contains both the writ of lawmaster intent which is what will give  you approval to travel into the sewer without being harried by the crownsguard and also gives  you the location of the sewer that leads you there following the basic instructions and asking  around you eventually find yourselves at the corner of ruen road and dewmist  liam ruin  matt yeah ruen as you approach this intersection largely still cobblestone a few 
none	  that are missing and the dust has sift pockets to make it soft the sky is still light  but you can see the sun just beginning to crest past the near walls and familiar to the two of you you  guys are maybe two blocks away from the outer wall of the trispires  laura hey guys were about two blocks away from the outer wall were super close  marisha all right  matt at the intersection there are two crownsguard that are stationed there that are  keeping eyes and watching around off to the 
none	 eastern side of that intersection behind one of the  poles that contain the lanterns that are lit at night you can see the cover that leads into the  sewer below its less of a sewer or manhole cover but theres an open drain and a latch and a  small metal pole that prevents anyone from going into it  liam are there any clowns in it  matt make a perception check  liam that is a why im looking it up a ten  matt you dont see anything dangerous georgie  travis oh jesus please 
none	 no  matt as you begin to spend time staring through the grate and start deciding how to get into  there one of the crownsguard stationed walks up and approaches quickly and goes excuse me can i  ask you what youre doing here  marisha oh good they came to us  travis yeah this is your opportunity to shine get em  marisha what  travis explain what were doing  marisha all right heres what were doing we got this whole writ thing from the lawmaster were  going to go down kill the monster thats 
none	 been tormenting you guys heard you lost a few guards  heard any rumors do you know anything before we go down there and maybe die  matt ive heard a few things its a  marisha uhhuh  matt apparently theres something down there thats been real scary and  marisha come on man  matt im not fucking going down there you kidding me  marisha im not why  matt i only know what ive heard  marisha did i ever ask you to come with us i just asked for rumors man  matt no i 
none	 can open the grate  marisha dont put words in my mouth  matt i wasnt meaning to put words in  marisha open the what did you hear  matt he scratches his head over his helmet and doesnt realize hes not getting to the itch  marisha stop with the nervous tics stop  matt all i know is that apparently they lost a couple of guys down there and  marisha i know that  matt one of them was pissing himself and ran  marisha thats still not information on the monster  matt well be 
tavern	 my guest he pulls a key off of a ring and goes down to the latch on the metal bar  that blocks off the entry and pulls it open  laura what guard was it that ran away  matt i dont fucking know theres a lot of them around here  ashley do you know how they were killed did anybody see any wounds  matt they never recovered the body  travis oh  ashley they never recovered the body  laura theyre probably eaten completely by now  matt well youre welcome to go down there 
none	 and continue  sam are all the sewer grates blocked with a lock  matt yes to prevent folks from wandering into them  laura oh no but how will we get out  matt well im stationed here for the next several hours so as long as you return  sam to this one  matt to this one youll be fine  laura what if we get trapped at another one and then we cant get out  matt well start shouting keep that writ on hand and if theres any crownsguard that hear you  theyll probably 
none	 be able to let you out  laura okay  travis seems reasonable enough  marisha is there a way to navigate the sewer systems any markings we should look out for  matt im going to be honest i havent been down there it smells real bad  travis do you know if the sewers flooded any time during the day any sort of unexpected water flows  matt i dont think so we havent had any heavy rainfall i havent been able to hear more than a  trickle down there for a number of weeks  marisha 
none	 nothing about what kind of monster it is no darkness tentacles big teeth  liam any sounds going on in there  matt nothing ive heard no  travis when people ask you who were those brave souls that ventured into sewer you tell them the mighty nein  sam and laura whistle and intone theme of the good the bad and the ugly  matt i understand theres seven of you  sam count again  laura i move to the other side of nott  liam you have to think about it for a while  matt he 
tavern	 looks genuinely overwhelmed by all the information and goes good luck and yell if you  need something throat clearing he pulls the rest of the bar open and you guys have this space  about a foot and a half  travis whos first  ashley i go  travis yeah get in there tank  matt yasha as you climb down immediately it drops  and your foot finds a rung theres a metallic bar that  acts as a ladder as you begin to lower yourself down you can look to your left and right and  
none	 what little bit of daylight is coming through helps fill out some of the interior you can  see what looks to be maybe 15 or so feet across from  side to side 15 to 20 feet from this wall to the other  slick stones a slight curvature that leads into a base where there is a small ditch or a  basin where old liquid is trickling through there is a mild decline heading away from the direction  you are and a mild incline heading in the direction of the trispires the smell is not  
none	 pleasant but youre a tough chick its never been an issue so you get yourself down and its  no more than ten feet to climb to the base of this at the moment you see from this spot where youve  climbed down the ceiling drops low to about ten or so feet youre probably about 15 or 20  feet below the surface now  ashley ill take out my torch ill light my torch once i get down there  matt your torch lights and the bright space begins to open up from side to side  
none	 laura yells do you see any monsters down there  ashley i look around yells back everything looks good  matt make a perception check  ashley oh  laughter  matt spoke too soon  ashley i forgot how to play dd everything looks good screams uhoh  liam the boulder from raiders  travis yasha  ashley eight like i said everything looks good  liam do you want nott down there its what you do youre very good  ashley yeah come on down nott  sam before i go can i borrow that ring of water 
none	 walking  laura oh sure wait which one was it  sam not that one that one or that one i know what those are  laura what about this one  sam yeah thats it  laughter  sam i dont know if you have to attune to it but im going  laura you dont  matt yeah you dont have to  sam all right ill go down there with yasha  matt you climb down and join yasha there you can see the slight decline behind you as it progresses  away from the direction of 
none	 where this current seems to have happened once again the smell is stagnant  a combination of waste product and whatever else has rotted and congealed down there that smell of  bacteriafilled liquid and water continuing upward it curves a little bit to the right and  out of sight with a faint bit of torchlight that bounces off the slick wall there is a weird humid  warmness to the air down here its not extremely pleasant you dont see anything else in here other than  what look to be clusters of waste combined with sticks and 
tavern	 whatever else has washed down here  through previous storms and has begun to build up blockages here and there maybe a foot two feet across  sam are we going to keep going or should we get the  ashley we can wait until everybody gets down  laura can we come down  sam its fine just come down  taliesin coming down  ashley i keep looking keeping watch listening  matt you all eventually down into the sewer grate and then you hear the metal scraping click and  the metal bar up top is closed 
town	  laura he locked us in  travis no he just closed it jester  sam its a trap were all going to die  ashley we wont die  travis what do we think go up or down up right  laura i think a monster would be down  sam monsters are down  marisha can i do a look around to see if there are any types of street marking for the sewers  matt make an investigation check  travis i put the glove of blasting on my left hand  marisha natural 18 22 i 
town	 believe 22  matt looking at right near the base of where the rungs are it looks like there are arrows that point each  direction the arrow to the right which leads upward splits into three additional arrows  marisha so one two three type of a thing what about the arrow to the left  matt its just a continuous arrow  travis what the fuck did you just draw  marisha this arrow splits into three arrows and then and its a penis  travis if you ever make a road sign people are fucked that is 
town	  liam thats a nintendo controller  travis yep thats some old fucking street fighter combo shit  taliesin up up down down left right left right  marisha right yeah also theres got to be an a and b around here all right i guess there are  more options this way or down deeper  taliesin south  marisha i mean it is a sewer system  travis you really want to go south you two  taliesin always down  ashley well i feel like if you were a monster you would go  liam go further 
none	 away from people  travis i like that logic  marisha or it could just be the main drainage out of the city  taliesin thats fair  travis bobby tarantino territory lets do it lets go south  marisha all right  laura i feel like were walking in a stinky crotch why  travis asshole  laughter  laura the traveler  liam and ashley no  liam everythings going to be fine jester  matt shh dont spoil it you guys begin to head southward its a very faint decline you can  only tell its a 
none	 decline in the sense that if you look right or left you can see the water is  trickling in the direction youre traveling the tunnel continues for about 100 feet or so before it  curves slightly to the right and then comes to another set of rungs and another sewertop access  liam were we told that there was some sort of webbing  matt yes that was the only notable element of what you were looking for  liam i see any of that as we go  matt perception check  marisha i wrote down blockage 
none	 webbing and nest  liam 19  matt no sense of webbing no  laura do we see any rats down here  matt at the moment you dont see anything moving no  ashley any tracks of any sort  matt make an investigation check if you want to  ashley 13  matt you get down and look about and you dont see any tracks by any means but you notice that  near where the water is and its a faint trickle of water the stream is about that wide and you  barely hear it moving 
none	 past you see elements of sludge that has slowly congealed over time along  the edges of this groove that guides the liquid and you can see bits are pushed like something had  moved through in the direction of where you were but thats it  laura in the direction of where we came from  matt angled like something slid and pushed through the water in the direction you came from  marisha how big are those slide marks yasha  matt about four inches  marisha four inches  matt yeah you see one or two that 
none	 slide out  laura does that mean were going the wrong way or the right way  sam im going to get down and take a little bit of the smear and  laura ew  sam do i taste anything  matt make an intelligence check  sam 19 plus five no plus three  matt its a combination of things your alchemical history and heightened goblin senses  for waste product theres hints of excrement  liam know how much diarrhea blasting they did in the middle ages  groaning  matt no no no  no all 
none	 right um  sam its old diarrhea  matt stop it sam okay  taliesin this is your fault  marisha there are people eating  at home right now  matt theres a hint of an iron aftertaste something oxidizing somewhere in the water or the  water itself a faint hint of sulphur from the water and things breaking down in the water  nothing that catches your immediate attention except for  oh my god shes no longer  roleplaying  laura oh my god i didnt even put it together  liam thats all thats in 
none	 the haversack  laura i just want this  matt because you rolled so high that faint iron aftertaste is familiar  sam familiar  laura is it blood  matt it reminds you of when youve licked a wound or bit your lip its very faint because you  rolled that high youre like hmm  sam this is bloody stool  groaning  taliesin how would you know that  sam i know this taste i know it well  travis nobody is going to ask you why you know that just so were clear you dont need 
none	 to  explain anymore  sam its sort of like pringles where you just cant have one  laura i might throw up  matt so what are you guys doing  sam so somethings been killed and dragged that way  travis i think maybe we should head back in the opposite direction  ashley in the area where were at the only exit now goes up another rung to the outside  matt correct or continues on the direction you were traveling looking at that set of rungs you  can see the arrows that are still marked 
none	 there theres a singular arrow that goes in the  direction where you came from and the other arrow splits into two you get the sense that each of  these indicates where the next if you continue that way if its going to divide or be straight  part of this network of sewers that have been built below zadash long ago  travis since youre tasting hemorrhoids in the water its probably coming from that direction  laura yeah youre right  marisha the water seems to be moving towards the direction were going  matt you were 
none	 heading down and the waters trickling in that direction  marisha go back the other way  laura we turn around  travis lets do it  matt you guys continue back to where you were and traverse instead upwards you guys had paid a  little bit of attention when you were traveling towards the trispire but the entire city is not  level there are grades to it it was built over hilly terrain as most of this valley itself has  all sorts of varying heights of hills and clusters of hills the trispire is up on 
none	 a raised hill  within the citys construct so as you ascend in the direction of the trispire you get the sense  that youre not ascending too terribly much but youre now just about underneath where the wall  was as it curves around a bit you look ahead as yashas holding out her torch and you can see a  tintersection of the sewer where it continues on straight or heads to the right or to the left  laura you should probably lick the ground everywhere and see if you taste that blood  anymore  matt 
none	 you also see more of those clusters of builtup refuse that have created small masses in  the ground where the water is pooling and making its way around  liam blockages  matt yeah  travis the curved surface of this area can we see the ceiling clearly or is it way above us  matt you can yeah and while the floor itself the walls gradually come in and become a bit of a  level platform and then descend into the ditch where the water is traversing the ceiling is a  continued curvature of it its 
none	 almost like a tube  laura any webbing  matt make a perception check  sam im going to look for footprints  matt you make an investigation check  laura perception  sam thats a one  laura 21  matt you see a very faint barely shifting piece of thin silk cheese clothlike material that is  barely visible on the cusp of the torchlight on the righthand side of that intersection  laura guys guys look look bring the torch over  travis dust  laura its a webbing  matt as we continue from this point 
none	 guys i want to know what your marching order is as youre  traversing forward  liam hey im at the back  matt right we have caleb at the back  laura maybe that would be bad though maybe you should be in the middle have you ever been at a  haunted house they come at you from behind  marisha thats true the middle is the safest ill take the front with yasha im assuming  sam ill be right behind them  taliesin ill be with you  travis yeah swords in the middle  matt 
none	 nott youre in the middle with them  sam middlerear  matt jester where are you  laura i guess ill be right behind molly  matt there we go so you go up and inspect the web  laura yeah  matt you guys head up with the torch you come into the intersection the water is coming down  from the path in front of you directly across the lefthand tunnel continues for about 40 or 50  feet before it curves off and goes upward again almost a parallel path theres water trickling  down there thats 
none	 all meeting here to the right where this webbing is there is no water it is a  dry ditch  laura i bet thats where we need to go its blocked  ashley can i touch a little bit of the webbing with the flame  matt sure you bring the torch to the webbing and watch as it burns away in a few seconds and turns  to ash and dust theres also a very faint scratching sound  taliesin im activating one im pulling a hand down one of my swords and im getting it to light 
none	 up  matt you activate one of them as it lights up you bring the torch around to look  marisha putting my goggles on  travis im going to go ahead and cast armor of agathys get on the spectral frost armor  matt as the armor filters up onto you the weird warm humid air of the sewer interior seems to  crystallize against your armor the ice that normally gives a translucent bluishwhite color  has a strangely yellowgreen tint to it  marisha poopmist  travis its the snowcone variety  sam as i see everybody 
none	 doing this im going to take a big swig of liquor  matt okay you take a quick swig you guys look out in the distant tunnels and you see nothing  travis scratching sounds a rat and were all like whimper  marisha squeaking  matt its funny as you glance down at the ground though one of those small clusters of  refuse shifts a little bit and shifts again  laura whispering what is it  marisha i take a ball bearing  laura poke it with your stick  matt i say little its a few 
none	 feet across theyve gotten larger as youve progressed on  marisha im going to take a ball bearing and ping it  laura how close is it to us  matt theres a bunch up in the hall around you right now as you throw the ball bearing and it  hits some of it breaks away and you see horrible matted fur theres a flash in the torchlight  where you see two eyes reflect through and you hear this sound shriek you watch as fangs open  up and a bunch of the other clusters of gathered refuse 
none	 all suddenly begin to shift and skitter in  your direction i need you all to roll initiative  all exclaiming  laura were fighting pooprats  marisha its a hairball  taliesin oh my god  laura thats what happens when i roll one that i havent been charging up  sam yep yep its definitely because of that  look at this sewer is that real wet  laura it just looks wet  marisha its like resin  matt we had you guys up here  travis its actual shit  laura matt is very committed  
none	 marisha its reality seeping into our game a little bit  matt all righty  laura oh no see caleb look you shouldve been in the middle of us  matt all of these sewerfaring giant rats begin to rush towards you their fur seems to have over  time merged with other bits of discarded debris and matter causing this outer shell of broken  garbage trash and excrement that protects them and gives this look of a horrible halfburned  pile of compost with teeth and fur rushing in your direction on that note  ashley i love 
none	 that were fighting rats right now  marisha i know its so baldurs gate i love it  laura chanting level three  matt for initiative here guys lets start with 25 to 20 anyone  laura oh shit really  matt oh damn  sam 20  travis 20 as well natural 20  matt you rolled a natural 20 whats your initiative  travis zero  matt oh thats right we have nott and fjord 20 to 15  ashley 17  marisha 19  travis im a limited fucking warlock  marisha chanting level three  matt 
dung	 15 to 10  ashley oh shit  matt 10 to five  laura eight  taliesin six  ashley no i know im one to talk  laura no mine was nine  travis and marisha nine  matt molly what was yours  taliesin six  matt all righty  liam vier  laura it mightve been eight lets just make it eight because i cant remember if i rolled a five  or a six  matt its fine it doesnt matter in the order at the top all of them start rushing in their  eyes 
none	 glaring as they shift past the torch that yashas holding theres probably six maybe seven  in the vicinity at a quick glance around you and theyre all rushing in your direction nott and  fjord you guys are up first  travis i turn to see where all of them are in relation to the party are there any sons of  bitches over here that i cant see  matt at the moment you dont see any  travis okay great i turn around and i see caleb being flanked by two of them and i know he 
none	 is  super squishy can i run towards this rat  matt you can  travis can i reach back with my hand and  matt that rat there gets an attack of opportunity as you swipe out of its range first that is going  to be a 15 actually not bad  travis that hits  matt that hits  laura you just got bit by a rat running away  matt as it snaps out at you you take five points of piercing damage as it bites out  you feel its teeth sink into the back 
none	 of your calf muscle through the armor and into the back of the  thick running muscle the pain strikes through you you yank your foot away and you feel  something tear you can feel the blood running down the back of your leg and inside your boot as  you feel the pounding of the very dirty bite that its left in the back of your leg  travis the rat takes ten points of frost damage  matt as you pull away from it the pounding pain of your leg is also accompanied by the sudden  
none	 sound of a rat shattering into ice pieces against the ground and disintegrating as it bites and  sinks its teeth into you the thing suddenly crusts over with a similar type of strange  yellowishgreen ice before it t1000 shatters across the floor of the inside of the sewer  continuing your round  travis i reach back to strike the rat as my hand comes down ill summon the falchion into my hand  and strike down  matt in one sweep an empty hand apparates and water springs out from the grasp as it slams down  
none	 go ahead and roll for an attack  laura is it also yellow water  matt and travis no  travis its a 14  matt a 14 hits you can roll damage  travis it was onehanded so 1d8  ten points of damage  matt as you sweep down you completely bisect the rat with your blade it screams out in this loud  heavy horrible monstrous squeak youre not used to hearing what normally is a small rodent sound  but amplified from a larger bulbous mutated form that it now has as you impact you see 
none	 it cut in  half it releases this putrid cloud of whatever gases its body holds in it i need you to make a  constitution saving throw please  travis oh shit  travis nine 13  matt you manage to hold your breath and back out of it as it dissipates around you that finishes  your turn  travis yes it does  laura fjord why you got to fart while were fighting  travis i got nervous  sam theres a couple rats within range of my allies right so that i could get sneak attack 
none	  matt correct theres one right there each one of these is considered one spot between you  sam okay ill disengage back away down that hall that way get far enough away then turn  around back go whimper and fire my crossbow at the one next to jester no thats molly  matt right there okay go for it roll for attack  sam 15 plus four i think  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  sam okay thats a lot of d6s right yeah  okay so 15  matt it rears back and 
none	 goes to leap in the air towards mollys face it gets maybe two inches off  the ground before your bolt sinks right through its skull emerges on the other side and it spins  in the air the momentum of its leap striking the momentum of your bolt and theres a spray of  blood in the air this noxious cloud of gas emerges from the wound thats left in the side of  its throat i need molly beau and yasha to make constitution saving throws please  marisha not fun  groaning  ashley oh no  
none	 sam its a small hole the bolt makes  matt its like popping a balloon it explosion they seem based on the bacteria and whatever  theyve been living in to be carrying a large amount of this gas in their body whatd you get  marisha natural one  ashley eight  taliesin 16  matt molly you pull away for the moment and put your coat over the front and block it the two of  you unintentionally it gets into your nose it stings your eyes you both take three points of  poison damage  laura 
none	 oh no  ashley shit  marisha and travis gagging  matt finished your turn nott  sam thats it  matt beau youre up as youre coughing its stinging all of your senses and you right  yourself and prepare for your turn  marisha oh sorry hang on im taking damage one two three apply damage im going to take  this one that is in between closest to me and yasha and im going to do a big ol golf swing  with my quarterstaff not that dice you were mean to me ooh thats good 22 
none	 to hit  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  marisha oh no thats a four i thought that was a one for a second eight damage  matt eight damage angrily in response to this you sweep down with a giant golf swing of your  staff and as it hits it impacts bludgeons the side of its body it gets slammed hits the wall  and falls to the ground some of the gas seeps out of its body but it isnt exposed it is dead but  the method of damage delivery seemingly didnt disturb 
none	 whatever was contained within its body  marisha interesting i still have my other attack yeah can i move in and kick that guy  matt over which one  marisha yeah that one im going to rat kick rat kick  natural 20  matt jesus  marisha come on give me that big ol four thats a one six damage  matt you rush up and critically kick this rat in the side of its body wham you feel breaks and  bones or might be sticks might be whatever else has created this shell of debris about 
none	 its body  it gives this screeching sound as falls over onto its side and then gets back in its place its  hurting its barely holding itself in place but its angry and ready to snap back at you  marisha i reach over to yasha and i go  matt and it is yashas turn actually  ashley yeah wait is this a dog next to caleb what is this  matt no those are all rats i didnt have as many rat minis for this use your imagination  travis laughing i have reservations about killing a 
none	 sewer dog  ashley okay i think  matt you get the idea  ashley i think shes got this so i dont want anything to happen to caleb can i get to any of  the ones over by him  matt you have enough movement to get to any of those  ashley okay so ill move over to one of those lets go to the one closest to him  matt over here one two three  ashley im going to wait so slashing so bludgeoning keeps it from  liam from breaking open  ashley im 
none	 going to rear back and punch it  matt okay go for it make an attack roll  sam and marisha punch it  matt yasha the rat puncher youre not raging right its just a regular attack  ashley 23  matt that hits so it takes one point of damage plus whatever your strength modifier is  laura thats good  taliesin dont you have a actually youve got an unarmed strike  ashley unarmed strike yeah  laura i look like i have an unarmed strike too but i dont think i do  ashley one plus 
none	 your strength modifier  matt yep  taliesin so that means you can do four points of damage technically its not one point its four  points  matt well its one point and then she adds her strength modifier to it so four yeah so it  takes four points of damage as you bludgeon it you hold the sword with one hand or your swords  probably still sheathed at this point youre holding the torch in one hand so you rush up and  fistpunch it  ashley do i get i dont because i moved do 
none	 i get a bonus action mumbling still trying to  figure this out  liam is the torch in your punching hand  matt its not a light weapon its not a weapon you can offhit with it  ashley can i just touch it set it aflame  matt you couldve if that was your action but youve already punched it however you did  straight up rush up and coldcock deck a sewer rat in the face once again you feel the crunching  right behind it as it falls over and gets back up its jaws hanging 
none	 off to one side and it has this  horrible gurgling sound as it screams at you a combination of this reddish blood and whatever  putrid green liquid is mixing and pouring out of its mouth  ashley i move my cloak to  matt okay that ends your turn then right all right its now their turn this one is going to  shift around painfully limping to get down and try to bite out towards your legs this ones  going to move still in combat with you and go after actually no because you punched it 
none	 its  going to continue after you this one is going to come after you as well since you rushed up in its  way so the one coming after beau that is going to be a 15  marisha miss  matt misses you duck out of the way the two against you is a 16  ashley mmhmm  matt that hits  ashley mmhmm  matt all right and a 17 both hit so you take from that first one six points of piercing damage  as it leaps up and actually  ashley i have resistance 
none	 to piercing  matt youre not raging  ashley oh you have to be raging  matt yeah thats resistance from the rage thats okay  ashley okay got it  matt you can use a bonus action on your turn to rage if you want to  ashley got it okay  matt its okay so you take six points of piercing damage as it bites up and you put your  arm in the way and it clamps onto your forearm it begins tearing you shove it off and it lands onto  the ground spins and gets 
none	 back to its feet the other one you take four points of piercing  damage as you shove that one off the other one leaps onto your back and begins snapping at the  back of your neck and shoulders and you shove it back onto the ground and it readies itself for  another strike as theyre slowly swarming around you ending their turn now jester youre up  laura okay im going to run up to the one that just attacked yasha yeah and im going to hit it  with my handaxe because im not very smart 
none	  matt go for it this is the one thats already been punched too so you rush up with your handaxe  and swing go and make an attack roll  travis you could flip it bladeup  laura that definitely hits thats 21  matt yeah that hits go and roll damage  laura thats a seven  matt seven points of damage the rat thats face is already broken even when it managed to bite  towards yasha earlier it was mostly dragging its top fangs across the side of her forearm as its  jaw would not 
none	 actually snap shut you finish the blow by taking the axe swiping down as you do  you carve into its body and a cloud of poison dissipates from its torso area i need yasha  caleb and you jester to make constitution saving throws please  laura aw you see it was like strains no fuck you  ashley 19  matt okay you manage to hold yourself off not being taken into it a second time  liam eight  matt five points of poison damage to you as you accidentally inhale a spray of it into your 
none	 face  youre like gasping  travis its in my mouth  matt five you also take five points of poison damage  laura oh no  sam tomato juice bath  laughter  travis that shit doesnt work  taliesin no it doesnt help  matt that end your turn jester  laura i think so  matt okay so you finish coughing  laura wait yeah i dont want to use that just yet  matt okay then molly youre up  taliesin i see the mess this is making and im going to turn around and im 
none	 holding the sword  but im going to punch with the hilt of my sword  matt go for it which one are you going up to the one that beau kicked earlier  taliesin no the one that attacked yasha  matt okay go for it roll a d20 and add your strength bonus  taliesin plus my strength my nonexistent strength modifier  thats a 12 to hit  matt 12 just hits  taliesin thats one damage  matt you deal one point of damage to that one as you reach down and sock it in the 
none	 head  taliesin i can take a bonus attack though and im going to hit it again  matt go for it  taliesin 12  matt well are you attacking with your  taliesin well im using my other hand since technically i have two attacks its not two  matt you have two attacks with the light weapon on the side technically eh ill allow it its  fine go for it  taliesin its another point of damage  matt okay so it takes two points of damage so now you guys are rat punching you guys 
none	 are going  through and punching the fuck out of rats  travis punching the fuck out of rats  matt repeatedly decking the face  travis fuck you you dirty rat  matt your knuckles are bleeding a little bit its not really enough to damage you but as  youre punching down youre hitting slick oiled fur and jagged points of broken wood and whatever  else has jammed itself into its matted fur but youve managed to hit it a couple of times and  its taken a little bit of damage but its still like snarls 
none	 it looks very cornered and lashing  out now that ends your turn molly caleb youre up  liam i would like to start backing up towards in this direction towards nott away  laura oh no  liam oh no i would use a caleb bonus action to dry heave and then i will use my action to cast  fire bolt towards the rat by yasha  matt by yasha go for it roll for the attack  liam ja groans that it is a oh no thats okay its a 13  matt 13 hits go and 
none	 roll damage on the fire bolt its a d10 right  liam ja d10 its five hit points of damage  matt five between the punches you gave it thats enough to finish it  cheering  matt as you run back you finish dry heaving and then release the bolt of fire it rockets past  the sewer walls light up in succession down following the streak of flame through as it  impacts theres a burst and what would have been the gas that is released from its body  incinerates from the fire damage and does not 
none	 affect anyone surrounding it all righty  finishing calebs turn that brings us to the top nott and fjord  laura are there more rats  matt there is one more over here thats limping next to beau  sam wheres our order  travis its down here its rats were not using that shit  laughter  sam all right nott will go forward next to caleb and peer around and fire another crossbow  marisha oh no i got it god  sam i know i havent been in any gas i dont know whats going on all 
none	 i can see is you guys  going yelling like weirdos so ill fire  matt go for it  marisha aw too helpful youre being too helpful  sam 18  matt 18 hits roll damage  sam theres sneak attack damage too right  matt yep  sam thats a lot in the teens  matt how do you want to do this  sam i guess i will  travis ray  laughter  taliesin way to date yourself right there  sam if theres a way to pin the rat to the wall ill do that 
none	  matt okay as you turn around the side of caleb putting your second bolt in spinning around  firing it strikes the side of it and where you hit it in the side theres this large pocket of  stretched rat skin where its pulled so far that the fur itself is disparate and you can see the  peach flesh beneath the fur as it hits it explosion its a combination of force from both  the blow of the bolt and the propulsion of the release of gas that sprays right in the direction  of beau 
none	 i need you to make another constitution saving throw please  travis save you got it smash it youre rolling the bad dice again  marisha it rolled a natural one again laura put it in jail  matt thats okay you only take one point of poison damage i rolled really low for that one  laura its really pretty though what a pretty die  marisha whimpering i know  matt you take one point of poison damage  marisha okay  liam everyones catching their disease here  laura oh no matt wait how do we know 
none	 where were going though how will we choose  matt ill leave this here as a visual aid sure  taliesin you worked to make it so nice  matt this is the direction you guys had come in from so the liquid is traveling down this way  and then down this way and there is no liquid from the side and the web that you had destroyed  is up in this corner  laura okay we go that way  matt youre going to go in this direction  liam before we move i am standing with 
none	 two flickering calebs next to me and all three of us  look at molly like jim from the office and they go away  laughter  laura oh no how hurt is everyone  travis you gotta look in the camera  taliesin i did  travis oh good yeah  ashley i mean im 19 out of 32  laura right i should do a cure wounds on you  ashley ill take it  laura okay i cast cure wounds on yasha  liam what were you down to  ashley 19  laura thats above your 
none	 whole  liam yeah thats my max  ashley thats your max  liam yeah im sitting at 14  ashley well its good i took the hits you know  liam yeah thats your job  laura thats why i said it eight points  matt in comparison to some of the scents youve encountered in this conflict suddenly the rest of  the sewer doesnt smell as bad  travis yup nostrils are burned right the fuck out  matt yeah  laura oh how hurt are you beau  marisha im all right im only down five 
none	 hit points  laura oh okay let me know you guys because ive got lots of healing because im the cleric  taliesin seriously caleb how are you  liam ah you know ive been worse its okay im okay  taliesin if we hit you really hard would you still be standing up right now  liam if who hits me very hard  taliesin thats a good question i hadnt really thought about that  liam if she hits me very hard i am a dead man if she hits me very hard im probably okay  sam 
none	 i would never hit you  liam i know thats just you know its just a  sam i care for you caleb  liam you have a monster on your chest  ashley are you very scared  liam generally are you asking me  ashley just right now  liam right now no because i am with all of you and those were just mice  sam i am extremely scared right now but i think that we killed the monster and we can go back to  surface now right  ashley i dont think that that 
none	 was the monster  sam that was clearly something down here thats been killing people  laura i think somethings making those things like that  liam the rats are not making webbing theres something else  laura oh god what if its a giant spider  liam its probably a giant spider  laura and its infecting the rats whispering and theyre turning into poisoned  sam spiders dont like rats do they  taliesin rat spiders ooh  ashley i dont understand why those rats were  laura poison balloons  ashley chuckling yes  sam did you 
none	 see the one that kind of looked like a dog though that was freaky  taliesin at first i thought it was some sort of evil gassy dog  liam well i would theorize that perhaps their diet is 20 food and 80 diarrhea so its not  very surprising that they explode into fecal matter  marisha can i bend down and covering with my vest a little bit see if i can search and figure  out exactly what these things are made out of  matt okay as you push through one of the open wounds from 
none	 one of the ones that was cut through  by either jester or fjord id say about a third of the body mass is an assembled shell of refuse  the interior of it appears to be rat or animallike general array of organs though a lot  of them have a colorless gray or beige appearance to them and a lot of them look to be in various  stages of necrosis and theres a lot of infection inside  travis and laura groaning  matt yeah its pretty nasty  marisha guys i think these are undead rats 
none	  laura i think theyre full of pus  taliesin are they undead rats  matt you can go ahead and make an intelligence check  taliesin with advantage  matt with advantage  taliesin all right wheres my intelligence there we are thats a no thats a nine  matt nine  taliesin travis laura and ashley nein  liam you could just say nine  matt you would know enough from the knowledge that you have that while there is necrosis in  there it doesnt look like its fully in there these things are  taliesin mostly 
none	 undead  matt or at least they were alive up until a moment ago these infections when they continued  for a period of time probably not for long  marisha zombie rats  laura just really infected rats  liam no they had pinkeye in all their parts  travis you know this really isnt what we need this is only the appetizer maybe we should try to  find the main course  laura we should keep going should we be more sneaky or should we just walk  ashley yeah maybe we should be sneaky  travis 
none	 yeah i think stealth would be a good idea  taliesin lets be sneaky  travis to the right  matt to the right okay you do get a glance with your torchlight yasha as you glance up the path  across the way and the path that curves around the side and you do see a few other similar  collections though not moving or not reacting to the vicinity of where you are even glancing at  the ones who were fighting you you can see upon closer look that their eyes are snowblind or  infected to 
none	 the point where they were very nearsighted or close to blind the patches in the  distance you can see arent reacting you your presence  laura we could set them on fire from a distance  travis or just dont disturb them  laura yeah but what if they all spring up we could just set them on fire  sam are we going that way  matt no youre going that way  sam were going a different way  laura okay then let them live and die in horrible pain  taliesin yes  matt laughs id 
none	 like you to all roll stealth checks please  sam stealth checks can you help someone there jester  laura oh yeah here you go  sam not me i dont need it  laura who is the most noisy of us all which one of you fuckers needs some help  ashley i rolled shit for stealth so it wouldnt do me any good  laura well here take an advantage  ashley oh  matt ill let it happen usually you have to give that before they roll so you dont know  laura just kidding  ashley 
none	 should i take up the rear  liam youre coming back after a break  matt its fine  ashley 15  matt 15 is better  taliesin 12  laura hold on i have to check  sam ten not so good  laura eight not so good  liam 16  marisha and travis 18  matt okay as you guys continue down the right pathway you continue further and find the  clusters of makeshift bits of discarded material begin to give way as about 20 feet ahead of you  the torchlight begins to refract and 
none	 reflect against some sort of soft material that is  drifting and enclosing a portion of the walkway you see ahead of you a majority of the tunnel is  currently blocked other than a small path on the right side of it by a dense webbing of some  kind  laura lets set it on fire  matt you see a large knot or a not a nott a knot of webbing as well that is held aloft a foot  off the ground  marisha its the egg sack  sam or a body  laura or 
none	 it could be somebody thats being slowly sucked dry of all their blood  marisha youre totally right  laura should we set it on fire or should we see if its living  taliesin i think we should try to cut it down in case its a person  laura is it wiggling at all  matt make a perception check  laura 15  matt 15 it does not appear to be moving  laura i think its dead  sam you think its dead  laura or its sedated  ashley what if we blows air  
none	 sam should we go try to cut it down without alerting them  travis you normally touch a spiders web they come running  marisha thats true  liam i have read a lot of books lots of them have i ever read anything about the science of  larger insectoid creatures  matt possibly insectoids this would not be technically an insect  liam okay but its not familiar to me  matt i mean its webbing there are many creatures in nature that use webbing in different  forms and types  liam like youtubers  matt yes 
none	 theres that too glancing at this the mass that is encased in the webbing is about this big  laura its a dog  matt its about dogsized  taliesin or a rat  ashley is it close enough to us  matt its about 20 feet ahead of you  travis can we see a past that into any further clumps of webbing  matt make a perception check with disadvantage because it does go beyond the torch threshold  marisha it doesnt appear to be humansized  matt that one does not no  marisha that one does 
none	 not  travis 14  matt looking past you can see layers of webbing continue for about what you can see 20 feet  beyond that it looks to be an even heavier wall of it behind that completely blocks continued  access into that chamber you can see two other much larger clusters of webbing that are wrapped  around something  ashley are we able to get to this lump  matt you can get to it yeah  ashley or do we have to go through some of the web  matt theres bits of it that 
none	 are drifting below you see that it does shift every now and then it  looks like theres some sort of a breeze coming through faint as it is thats why from the  webbing that is currently held aloft between the ceiling and the floor and the left wall from your  perspective the first one you see every now and then you see it faintly shift as if a breeze or  water moves through  travis do we have to break any of the planes of webbing to get to this cluster  matt to get to 
none	 this one no  laura lets cut it down  ashley maybe we can look at it up closer  matt you can  taliesin im going to try to very gently maybe with everyones permission im going to gently  start cutting into the bottom of it not too deeply  sam wait should we get ready for some sort of distraction or to do something to the other web first  taliesin im sorry do you have a plan  sam no no i just  taliesin well all right then i keep moving downward  matt okay 
none	 is this the one with your activated rite  taliesin yes  matt and the rite you activated was  taliesin it was the radiant rite  matt the rite of the dawn as his scimitar which is now glowing with this faint radiant light  energy it almost burns through as you carve through slowly its not an easy cut but you do  carve through as you do the webbing begins to curl back and blacken at the edges as it pulls  away you see something furry and fleshy as you pull it back a few more 
none	 inches you watch as a rat  head lolls out a tongue falling out the side it looks to be dry it looks to be bereft of any sort  of internal liquid or life  laura thats good to know that means the humansized ones are probably fucked up too  ashley yeah thats probably true  taliesin or they havent been eaten yet  laura how long ago did they say the guards went down and didnt come back  travis quite a while but ill remind you that our mission is not to retrieve any guards its 
dung	 to  kill this beast  liam if we kill the beasts that are down here then it might be worthwhile to also check the  bodies of the guards you know because theyre not going back to the to their families you  following me  travis that was dark and angry  sam steal from the dead bodies  liam well theyre not going to use it  sam i agree yeah  taliesin ill work with that  travis shall we move forward to the first plane of webbing that would hinder our movement  liam just 
none	 a suggestion we dont have to do this im not even sure how i feel about it but i have  just learned how to create a somewhat spectral servant to me one that is unseen i could send it  in to poke about and if anything is going to happen it could happen to it first instead of us  sam i like that idea  travis does it interact with the environment  liam yeah it could poke at things and you know  marisha would it move the webbing as it went through  liam yeah 
none	  travis what do we like more poking the webbing or sending it up in flame  marisha i agree with fjord i think we we start poking around that things going to come running  travis might as well  sam but then well get to see it and get the drop on it  liam if you burn its web it will do the same thing  laura yeah what if we back up and burn it  travis my way of thinking is what if that web is sticky as shit i dont want to get caught 
none	 in it  laura thats why i said why dont we back up and burn it  liam i think thats actually a very good idea  taliesin lets try and not set fire to the human shaped things  sam yeah what if theyre still alive  laura well caleb how about you send your spectral servant to poke at the little masses of  human and see if they start wiggling  liam okay also i will say that you were worried about burning their dead bodies but if we  burn the dead bodies they might burn 
none	 were not going to help them but if any coin have or any  items that are magical in nature will be fine so its okay  sam oh yeah thats good  ashley the thing is if we kill them i mean were putting them out of their misery you know  laura theyll probably end up as giant pus sacks if they survive  ashley yeah theyre probably already  sam or maybe they just were wrapped up five minutes ago and theyre totally fine  liam yeah thats possible this thing that i can do this servant 
none	 that i can make its not going  to be able to open these things its very weak  laura i said poke it then if they wiggle then we know that theyre alive  liam thats true  travis how about a poke and then a flame  taliesin poke and wiggle then a flame  ashley i think if they start moving this things going to  taliesin well it knows that theyre alive  ashley but then well get eyes on it  taliesin so im sure they wiggle every now and then anyway  travis that 
none	 way nott doesnt have bad dreams that we burn some people that are still alive and then  we can set it all on fire  marisha oh no that was caleb who was freaked out by fire  travis oh right  marisha yeah  laura do it caleb  liam i pull a stick out of my coat and i hold it between thumb and pinky like this and theres a  string wrapped around it and i take my fingers and i pull along the string which begins to glow  a faint gold glow and a 
dung	 being same height and about same skinnyass proportions as myself  appears before me  matt well it does not appear  liam it doesnt appear you tell me because youre the dungeon master  matt its unseen but you sense its presence arrive  laura its unseen  ashley oh thats what that means  matt on the dry dustcovered floor of this interior part of the sewer where the temperature  has dropped and is a little less humid in this area there are two small plumes of dust on the  ground and you sense the servant 
none	 has arrived  laura i go up and i push it  matt okay you put your hand forward and its like hitting the back of someones back but  theres nothing there and it catches you off guard youre like what the heck it feels  somewhat amorphous like a heavy wind pushback for a second but theres no wind and theres no  whipping of force around your arm its very strange  laura i think your unseen servant farted on me  liam well the rats have already started so schmidt i want you to go to 
none	 these larger bundles  and give them a little pokeypoo  matt all right schmidt goes past  laughter  matt you sense this the first webbing barricade which has a small fivefoot space between it and  the wall to the next one the one that you saw which encompasses the entirety of this wall there  are small onefoot wide sections of it along the upper part of the wall where theres a gap but  most of it is pure web across there are two of them there and are you getting close with the  torch 
none	 to reveal it otherwise its going to be beyond the torch light its going to be very dim  and hard to see the details  ashley yeah ill follow as far back as i can  liam i have to stay within 60 feet of schmidt  matt right so the two of you approach the first barrier to see the second as schmidt approaches  the second barrier one of the masses which does appear to be humanoid in size shakes slightly  doesnt react the other one shakes slightly and you watch as an arm limply falls 
none	 from the side of  it some webbing tearing as it does you hear a metal sword clang to the ground you see a bracer  that once belonged to a crownsguard  liam whispers schmidt bring me the bracer  matt the bracer whoosh and drifts on its own in your direction  laura i wonder if the giant spider thing heard that  liam what  marisha yeah probably  liam what did you say i did not understand your accent  laura loudly i said i wonder if the giant  liam shh  laura you  
none	 sam she wonders if the giant spider heard it  liam yeah we all wonder that  travis so theyre dead huh  liam well not moving  laura burn that shit then the spider will come and we will burn that shit too  ashley how close am i to one of the human form ones  matt youre about ten feet from it  taliesin they look pretty dead dont they  matt they look pretty dead theyre ten to 15 feet from you  travis firestarter  ashley i mean this is the firestarter over here  
none	 marisha lets burn it  liam i can do it from a distance yeah  sam should we get into some sort of position so were not all clumped together  matt yeah do you have any specific order you want to maintain here  travis how about four on one side and three on the other of the tunnel  taliesin thatll do  ashley caleb do you want to stand behind me and little peeksies from behind  liam i would like to stand behind everybody  travis ill take the front of the other side of yasha 
none	 since ive got some armor  laura ill stand behind fjord  matt all right  marisha i guess ill go with team calebyasha  travis wow fucking betrayal okay  matt all right caleb yasha and beau  marisha im trying to split up evenly  matt is it molly and fjord at the front of the other group  sam ill go behind caleb  matt okay so nott goes behind caleb and then we have fjord and molly on the other side with jester  behind them  taliesin yep little bit of magic on both sides 
none	 little bit of tank  matt okay you move around that barrier and get to the next ten to 15 feet up where there is the  next larger barrier of webbing and the two unmoving humanoid forms wrapped up there  liam i can do this from 120 feet away once every six seconds im going to use fire bolt i would go  whoosh whoosh and hit them both  matt okay they both impact and the bodies shift theres a burst of flame some of the webbing  ignites and burns and curls away but it looks 
none	 like the flame is so instantaneous its not enough  to immediately ignite the webbing there is a burnt mark on them and neither of the forms move  or react to the impact and the web shifts and shakes for a moment before it eventually comes to  rest again  liam just as a test to the one on the right i do it again  matt okay you do it a second time it burns a little more as the webbing burns away in that  section you can see the crownsguard armor chestplate that is now 
none	 a little bit charred  beneath the impact  liam okay well hes dead should i just keep chipping away  marisha you still have your torch yeah  ashley yeah ill help are we moving forward or were still  matt theyre all still in the back but you can move forward if you want to move forward  liam well this is every six seconds so i could just stand here for a minute going whoosh whoosh  whoosh and not get close  travis hey nott will you do me a favor and make sure nothing sneaks 
none	 up behind us  sam theres things behind us too  travis could be  liam so i guess ill take the next 30 or 40 seconds if thats what it takes ill focus on  one and just keep burning it away  matt okay  sam im going to go 15 feet behind us  matt okay you shift yourself 15 feet behind make a perception check so you can watch with  disadvantage because unfortunately youre away from the torch light to do so  sam thats a one  matt so youre keeping watch  laughter 
none	  matt as one after the other the webbing is shaking and shifting eventually after four or  five blasts the web begins to catch fire and you watch as the red and orange flames expand and  begin to immolate both the unmoving bodies the webbing then burns away and eventually begins to  detach from the weight and the loss of tensile strength and that whole wall shifts and collapses  to the ground both of the bodies hit the ground the webbing burns away its not enough to catch  the bodies on fire though it does 
none	 singe and burn the exterior and as you look theyre both in  various states of decay the skin you can see as you approach a little bit yasha to take a look  the cheeks within their helmeted heads are sunken and sallow the lips are curled back over the  teeth they are drained of any internal life force or blood  ashley can i poke around with the tip of my sword and see if theres any money or something in their pockets  matt make an investigation check  liam singing we are the worst we 
none	 are the worst  taliesin hes not using it  ashley 18  matt prodding around yeah there is from just a glance they both have coin purses on their belts  folded into their belt as a protective measure they both look like they were caught in a state  where theyd be willing to travel anywhere and spend money  ashley ill take them  matt okay you being to pull from their bodies what are the rest of you guys doing  laura we could take their weapons i bet theyre nice weapons or we could return 
none	 them to the  crownsguard maybe they would reward us  taliesin and marisha do they have a dog tag  matt glancing about as you inspect the bodies theres no identifying tag to them there isnt an  elaborate system of maintaining crownsguard members or identifying that youve noticed at  least  travis can i search for puncture marks stab wounds bite marks  matt make a medicine check  laura can i take their helmets and put them in my pink bag  matt sure easy enough to do  laura what about their weapons do they 
none	 have any  matt they do they both are carrying a longsword theyre well kept not used you look along the  blade and there are barely any signs of indentation  laura does it say anywhere property of the crownsguard  matt no but they are uniform design theyre not elaborate or ornamental the crownsguard weaponry  are all pretty much designed or provided by a similar blacksmithy technique so they all feel  like theyre uniform to a certain degree  travis ten on the medicine check  matt thats enough its not too hard to see as 
none	 you look over each of the two bodies both of them  have heavy puncture marks either right in the back of the neck on one of them or the other one  has it right under the front of the chin the puncture marks are about that wide about two  inches across on each side where the skin and flesh has bubbled and pushed away from the side  and they go very deep in  travis so big fangs probably fucking pincers you know clicking yeah so watch your shit  liam caleb stands still for a 
none	 second and looks around do i hear anything  matt make a perception check  liam oh in my sleeve oh thats a one so i dont hear anything  travis hows the ground that were standing on now  matt there would have been some general webbing towards the base of this but youve burned away  that central area as you step forward you look beyond where that burning mark is and there is a  stark left turn it curves to the left and looking around the side it curves again to the right  maybe 20 
none	 feet beyond that and you see another webbing barrier where there looks to be three  different figures you see now there is another figure that is not part of the webbing barrier but  is just webbed to the wall right next to it  travis but the stone is unim  matt unimpeded to the point it would be an issue  travis not tacky  matt no you feel a little bit of stickiness when you step around from general fallen bits of stray  webbing strands and such but nothing that would impede your movement  
none	 laura how is it to try to chop through it with the axe  matt you can go try to either the one behind you or the one ahead  laura yeah i want to try doing it and see if it sticks to the weapon or if it cuts through  matt to the one ahead  laura yeah  matt okay you come forth to the web there in front of you to where the two other figures that  are massed there they are both humanoid and you now look over at a close glance as a 
none	 third one  small looks to be another one of the rat creatures that is caught in there you carve  through go ahead and make an attack roll roll damage for the handaxe  laura seven  matt seven okay you carve through and a large part tears through before your handaxe stops and  youre like grunts cant push any more you try and pull back and as you do you pull your arm  back and it gets ripped from your grasp and its now stuck and folded and your handaxe is now  wobbling in the 
none	 web  taliesin im going to very gently cut her handaxe out with my radiant sword  matt okay you begin to carve around it and pull it out and you eventually get it free but now  theres a cluster of webbing around it almost like the worlds worst cotton candy its wrapped  around the center of it but its sticky  travis the worst kind of candy  taliesin dont eat it  liam jester put it on the ground and take ten steps back away from it  laura metal plink  matt metal plinks the 
none	 metal hits the ground and makes a bit of a sound  laura except its covered in webbing so not as much sound  matt no but the metal still hits the ground  liam whoosh  matt you watch as the flames burn around it and free it it lights up the vicinity a little bit  theres that wedge opening where youve cut in that webbing barrier and behind it you can see the  entire floor of the next portion appears to have some sort of webbing layer around it and all the  walls are covered 
none	 in it across the way you can see rungs and the end of this portion of the  drainage that leads up into where you can see the wind would be coming through and that faint bit  of wind thats pushing through thats causing all the webs to shift is coming from what you can  barely make out to be the faint bits of sunset light peeking through another exit a sewage exit  just like the one that you came in you also see a number of other figures that are all webbed to the  walls 
none	 and encased within there  taliesin all of the ones webbed to the walls are just as emaciated and dead  matt make a perception check  laura can i get my handaxe back  matt you can yeah  laura thanks caleb  taliesin six  matt you glance past in the distance its too hard to see unfortunately because the torchlight  is too far away  ashley how close are we to those now  matt well youre at the second web wall thats about 25 30 feet from you so its beyond the  torchlight of 
none	 where youre standing  laura its a dead end past all of this its a dead end and just goes up  matt it looks like it it goes to a dead end but its all covered in webbing  laura its got to be around here somewhere right  ashley or its behind us and waiting until we get in its room  sam its not behind us  taliesin im going to start trying to cut down find the points of the web wall where its being  held together and cut any of the web  sam 
none	 nothing back here  matt because of your rite you manage to carve through and you watch as the second web wall comes  and folds to the end the bodies that are encased in it hitting the ground with heavy thuds you can  see the other bodies that are webbed to the walls around on the inside you can see the end of  this it is a giant web nest  liam if we deem it safe maybe someone could look out this other exit because probably something  is down here with us but mayhaps above 
none	 the grate this thing lives in a house perhaps i dont know  im spitballing  travis or if we go up to the grate and try and get someone to open the hatch in case we need to  beat a speedy retreat  liam that is also good that is two reasons to do it  laura should i go up  travis yeah do it  laura okay  travis give her the writ of law thing  laura is it blocked in and webby all along the ground  matt as you walk past the ground 
none	 itself is sticky you can still move but youre hindered  somewhat having to like pull through and it tugs at your feet you guys watch as webbing tears and  builds on the bottom of her boots as she walks in  laura i stop walking  matt okay you stop and look and you can see the faint outline of bodies that are webbed to the  wall parts of the faces that are revealed that are gray and lifeless drained on the far wall  you see a large cluster of webbing it looks like a mass 
none	 of three or four bodies jammed together and  you see one body thats right next to where the rungs are that is not as webbed as the others and  there is color to the skin you see elements of a humanoid face a halfling it looks to be about  halfling sized it is about a foot up off the ground webbed to the wall one arm is drifting  out and part of the face and unconscious but is not gray and dead like the others and thats  where were going to take a break  
none	 sam wait no but thats a person  matt i know well come back on that its because i want to make sure we all get to the  bathroom including myself i have to pee like a fucking racehorse so yeah well pick up on the  reveal of this nondead body  laura i dont like it either  ashley you went to nos like no no no  matt well be back here in a few minutes first and foremost we have our wyrmwood giveaway which  weve worked through some of the stuff yeah giveaways and

none	 of this segment of the sewer  where the webbing had become far more apparent you had discovered a few bodies that came over  you had carved through one wall and caused that to fall off to the side and leading to the very end  of it you saw an ascension that went to another exit grate into the city a number of bodies one  large webbed mass of a few bodies and one individual that looked to be still alive though  unconscious and webbed against the wall  laura is he reachable  matt from 
none	 you right now hes about 20 feet ahead of you  laura whispered hes still 20 feet away from me you guys hey fuckers  marisha what  laura im a little worried about walking any further because my feet are starting to stick to  the ground like a lot but theres a halfling stuck to the wall over here and i dont think hes  dead  marisha okay you stay there with the halfling i might be able to negotiate my way a little  further  liam is jester right up with the halfling  laura 
none	 no im 20 feet away from it  travis if you had to ballpark the distance to the halfling or to the very end of it  matt from you guys all together its about 25 feet 30 feet jester is a little bit closer  sam all clear in the back  taliesin id forgotten  travis i am going to join nott at the back and keep an eye on the rear  sam no need  matt make a perception check  marisha oh jeez louise  travis ten  matt okay fjord you shift around to 
none	 join nott in the back and you guys look off in that distance  you see nothing in the darkness behind you who else is doing what  liam i am going to walk up to jester and stand next to her and then i am going to send schmidt  forward to this halfling to try to maybe lift up his its i cant tell you the chin of this halfling  marisha im going to also move forward next to caleb  matt you move forward next to caleb as well you guys are finding your feet sticking 
none	 to the  material of the floor webbing you approach you watch as the head of this halfling is pulled away  from some of the webbing and lifted up it is male actually because youre still with yasha in  the back make a perception check both of you  liam well if i cant see  matt its low light beyond that so make a perception check with disadvantage  marisha ive got dope goggles though  liam oh well okay  matt you can make a straight perception check if youd like  liam well i would 
none	 say if i cant see if i knew i cant see if i were really in this place instead  of sitting as this table  matt you can if yasha comes closer but yasha has the only source of light  liam if i couldnt see coming up i would go poofing and send out dancing lights  marisha natural 20  liam there you go  matt the dancing lights appear in the air and begin to drift in help fill out the area your  torch light still being this larger beacon of flame light in the 
none	 space beau you glance ahead  and can see as the chin is lifted a thick band of tattoos  marisha i think these goggles are like polarized its real cool hes got a thick band of tattoos sorry  matt a thick band of tattoos that completely encompasses the neck to the point where whats  exposed from beneath its like black shapes and designs completely around  marisha of the halfling  matt of the halfling yeah  marisha do they look old or like a fresher tattoo  matt did you roll a natural 20  marisha 
none	 i did roll a natural 20  matt your amazing monklike sight theyre not fresh  marisha theyre not fresh  matt theyre not fresh  marisha do i see puncture wounds  matt you do not  marisha okay  matt also theres this weird sense that creeps on nott and fjord as youre glancing forward and  you both turn over your shoulder to see a massive pale white and blue arachnid creature legs  spindling outward at a width of ten feet or more giant dripping fangs and beady red eyes a row of  them glaring 
none	 right at you as this hiss pincers open up  laura how close is it to you guys  matt its right behind fjord and nott and it is striking you fjord as its first strike  sam it snuck up on us  ashley wait so its behind  matt its literally here  all oh  ashley was it on the ceiling the whole time  matt that is going to be a 23 to hit  travis against my 14 yeah  liam while this death is happening caleb is schmidt go like this to the halfling

none	 thrust into your torso you  take thats a terrible roll you take five points of poison damage nott you look up and see  this thing as it digs its giant pincers and fangs into fjords body and it pulls back and you watch  it vanish and disappear  travis fuck  matt i need you all to roll initiative  laura its an invisible spider  taliesin to be fair invisible spiders are the best spiders because you cant hey look at that  travis oh look at the webs  marisha why are we invisible oh 
none	  laura were not invisible those are dead people i see dead people  travis invisible shit ass bitch nipples on a horse  matt the last place you saw this  ashley are they invisible the people that are on the walls  matt the last place you saw it was there before it disappeared  all fuck  laura where before it disappeared  matt right there  laura wait why are all the other things invisible does that mean those are other things  that are going to attack us  matt these are all the bodies

none	 matt it does have partial cover though because of the angle youre at  liam yeah okay all right im going to use my movement to crawl out of the box so i can get a  better bead on it hopefully ill go as far forward and to the side as i can to get a better angle  matt counting thatll improve your sight there  liam okay so i am going to steady my arm against the other arm and point at it and blacken my hand  and send a fire bolt at it here it 
none	 goes well see if it hits probably not no i dont think it  does that is a 11  matt that unfortunately does not hit as its reacting from the impacts it begins to rear back  and as it does theres this one flash of light it seems like it notices its presence and gets really  low and flat suddenly its whole body which is massive shrinks low to the sewer as it passes  overhead it pops back up ready  liam then before the end of my turn im going to snapping and schmidt silently 
none	 comes up as close  as he can get next to me  matt that ends your turn  liam ja  matt all righty its now the spiders turn  travis its my turn  matt thats right i forgot  travis with my bonus action can i cast hexblades curse on the spider  matt yes you may  laura you should just kill it kill it its already nervous kill it and dont worry about  healing yourself  ashley hes looking rough  laura destroy it fjord  travis with the fucking glove of blasting that 
none	 we took off the thing can i go grunting and  fire all three of the scorching ray balls at the spider  matt you may make your three attacks with disadvantage because its a ranged attack in  immediate facetoface range  travis thats a nine plus two for 11  matt 11 misses the first one goes wide second strike  travis thats a one  matt goes wide again  travis 16  matt 16 does hit your first time using the glove youre not too sure how the aiming works  and the first two go

none	  it lights up you can see the streaks of blue designs across its pale white body the flames  impact and burn around the side it pulls back ready angrily back towards you that ends your turn  travis yeah  sam what happened to the healing coming  matt it didnt happen  taliesin hes a liar hes a lying liar  travis you just got to kill the spider and ill be fine  taliesin fair  matt its trying to decide what is the biggest threat right now im going to roll for it  between

dung	  all cloud over black with bits of trickling dark purplish blood pouring from the edges of them  that gives it disadvantage which you are very lucky it is because that was a natural 20 that  still comes to 16 does that hit  ashley that hits  matt you take from the fangs as it lurches towards you oof thats going to be 11 points of  piercing damage  ashley halved  matt yes because youre raging  cheering  matt you take five points of piercing damage and i need you to make a constitution 
none	 saving throw  please  ashley okay  marisha youve got this  ashley natural 20  travis woo crit on that shit  matt as it lurches forward and slams its fangs in the collar bone area you having no real armor to  protect it you take it head on the fangs sink and you feel the venom pulse through your torso  through your arms the burning pains goes through and you flex it off as you do so thankfully  reducing what would have been you only take 11 points of poison damage  liam yasha

none	 around i am deader than that spider would have left me  marisha all right where do i inquire  matt he sighs for a second theres a dive naught but five blocks from here called the  evening nip  marisha the evening nip  sam weve heard that before  laura yeah its in the letter  marisha all right  matt dont say his name just walk up to the old man behind the counter and mention youd like a  drink and while you have no coin youd be willing to offer many gifts  marisha 
none	 id like a drink  travis i have no coin willing to offer many gifts  marisha no coin  matt many gifts is the important part now i hope thats been of service and i as you seem  to be the types who see it fit to save a person that you havent met in the bottom of a terrible  sewer i would hope that you would be kind enough to know that that information did not come from  me and that youve never seen me before in your entire life  taliesin oh  marisha 
none	 whats your name  laura his name was thed  taliesin of course friend weve never seen you before in our entire life  matt as i havent seen you either  laura i didnt take anything from your pockets i really didnt  taliesin does anything about his tattoo irritate me  matt its not very well done  taliesin you know what i mean  matt yeah no  taliesin all right  matt okay  laura you really do have like a key to the grates like an extra one  matt i mean  he looks 
dung	 up behind him and says ive got mine but i need it for my work  taliesin thats fair  travis pretty sure we can call for someone with our  matt he glances over towards nott and says unless im mistaken it appears you have a female  friend here who could probably help you get around that anyway  sam i could try  matt anyway i bid you all adieu he pulls his hood up over his head and his little halfling  feet quickly carry him back in the direction where you guys travel the sewer 
none	  sam watch out for poo rats  matt distant yell im aware  travis how many of these victims were other than crownsguard any civilians or women children  matt no children one of them appears to be a woman in her 40s or so a lot of them appear to be  dressed in heavy leathers they may have been either coming through to try to clear up parts of  the sewer some of them look very poor and may have come down here in hopes of scavenging  whatever had fallen down into the sewer and 
none	 collected over time some of them appear to be  similarly dressed as thed or at least have a somewhat skulkingtype demeanor about their  wares  marisha anybody have any neck tattoos that look like serpents  matt no there are a handful that look like they probably have traveled this route before and got  caught up in it  travis well what did you find on the bodies sorry  marisha no are go ahead  travis yeah what did we find  liam there was a bunch of weapons and armor  travis nice  taliesin 
none	 and some coin  travis anything unique any unique things  taliesin why dont we get into some daylight and take a look  travis sure  liam we should reconnoiter to look at what we have  laura anything else interesting in the room outside of the bodies  matt outside of the bodies it looks like there is broken bits of what would have been furniture  or a cart at some time that got discarded or shoved down here from above other than that just  the general refuse youve come across down here in the sewer 
none	  taliesin we do have a spider body to pick  travis can i happen to see am i able to see the guy with all the tattoos of ships and stuff  matt yeah you see him  travis oh cool do i recognize any of the names of ships or any imagery  matt make an investigation check on that  travis ugh 11  matt okay looking about them and what you can rummage through hes pretty much naked other than  his underoos looking through theres like the midnight lorry you dont recognize that name at 
none	  all theres one of them thats the shell carrier dont recognize that one theres one name that  catches your attention it was called the pink giver and it came through your ports at one  point you remember it coming into port you were paid to take care of it offload things back on  the name itself was derived by a wooden carving at the front bow of the ship that was of a mermaid  with her arms extended that was gifting a human heart that was painted with this vibrant pink  color that was 
none	 its signifying visual yeah other than that nothing particular about it just that  you were like oh yes i know that ship  travis yeah  ashley is the broken howl on there  laura aww  matt its on the back  liam throwback  ashley that looks like a piece of shit ship  laughter  taliesin sings continuity roll for continuity  marisha beau turns to nott hey girl  sam yeah  marisha that little code you were talking  sam clicks tongue  marisha see any of that written around these walls or something 
none	 that looks similar to it  sam i can look around thieves cant is a written or spoken thing  laura both  matt its almost universally spoken and as a language its used for extended ciphers make an  investigation check  marisha can i help him out see if i spot anything give him an assisted roll  matt you can if you want to assist him  sam 19  matt you have advantage on it because shes helping you  sam 19  matt okay glancing about you can see behind the rungs theres about a 
none	 twoinch gap across the  wall there is a very very faint scratch into it that says although not referring directly to  yours it says money pot  marisha money pot  matt yes  sam whispers money pot louder it says money pot  matt which catches you offguard because youre like thats one of our  sam thats one of our oneshots  marisha what what  sam thats one of our things but thats not it cant its not us we werent down here before  were we  travis insight check  laughter  laura 
none	 i wonder if this grate leads up into the trispires then maybe it means lots of rich  people are up here  sam maybe maybe this is the name maybe theyve named all the entrances and exits or something  like that  laura maybe easy pickings  taliesin maybe they buried something here  laura if they dont allow the criminals in then theyd be real easy to pickpocket because no one  would expect it  marisha yeah  travis one way to find out  sam should we try to jimmy this lock and get out 
none	  laura well we can probably call up we have the writ  sam okay well do we need to get the spider first  laura well its all tied up me and yasha can probably  ashley we got it yeah  marisha ill put a little bundle on my staff as well  liam jester will you come look at my eyes they feel a little bloodshot im not feeling well  after my encounter with the rats  laura sure i put my hands on either side of his face can i see anything weird  liam

none	  taliesin im waiting for them to break up and i suppose were packing the spider up to bring topside  ashley i really hide the money that i found  sam im taking at least one button off of every single person in the  matt easy enough to do you have quite a collection going  sam yeah  travis im just waiting  matt you guys have reconvened youve gathered your things the spider has been all the legs  have been pulled up and wrapped and you have either beaus staff or something else to lift 
none	 it  with on both sides because its pretty heavy its going to take two of you to carry  laura all right well carry it  ashley yeah  matt it would have to be you two its pretty strong the two of you lift it  ashley are we the strongest  laura oh my gosh yes  ashley oh  laughter  matt so where are you guys going  laura because you have a big lollipop to carry  sam weve got to go up  laura up these things into the money pot  matt 
dung	 okay so whos going first  travis nott  laura well somebody that can talk to the guards  travis and taliesin nott  sam i dont know guys all right ill try shouting hello were stuck down here and we  want to come up let us out of the sewers let us up  matt as you climb up nott and look through the sun has set and the night has gone purple to  dark navy blue as night has taken it you glance up through and youre looking out into a dark  alleyway you see 
dung	 two sides of an alley shaded and dark about maybe 25 feet ahead it opens up  into a fine cobblestone road you can see fine buildings across the way you see the lanterns are  light in the center of the town you have not been to this part of the town but its pretty well  kept and no one seems to be immediately around to hear you  laura is it locked  matt it is locked  laura can you pick the lock  sam oh yeah  matt go ahead and make a lock picking 
none	 check  sam what is that sleight of hand  matt no its your thieves tools so your proficiency bonus plus your dex bonus  sam dex bonus is four proficiency is three plus 12 is  matt well two isnt it  laura yeah i think its just two right now  sam oh its just two okay  matt itd be six  sam 18  matt 18 it takes a moment and you have to reach around the other side and it opens up and the  bars push open the gap here into the back of 
none	 this alleyway is about two feet tall each of you  can get out comfortably that spider is going to need some squeezing  taliesin well give it a push  sam we can move it up first  matt you guys one by one get up back topside you manage to push it through it damages the  body parts of it break and slide off its not designed to fill through that space but its  still mostly intact  marisha im imagining the playdoh fun factories  matt not quite that bad but it definitely doesnt look 
none	 as pretty on the other side  taliesin i hang back for a second and i very quickly gently socially pin caleb to the wall  face to face as awkwardly close as i can get  liam i am definitely not looking you in the eye  taliesin no youre not hey caleb im fine if you skim something off the top thats fair but  be clever about it just distribute 60 or 70 percent of what you find okay good boy give him  a little slap on the face and then i go up  liam 
town	 nothing from me  matt so you all eventually gather up at the top street side its completely dark the night sky  is above you you can see the warm lantern light across the various street intersections and along  the path in front of the various buildings you definitely recognize this jester this is indeed  the trispires district  laura hey you guys this is where my hotel is  travis oh well wasnt the plan to have a what did you call it  marisha shouting room party  liam what time of the day is 
none	 it  matt it is night it is freshly night  liam but what time of the day is it because i know  taliesin party time  liam very very close to what time it is i know sundown sunup  matt yeah its sundown id say with the time it took you to scavenge the bodies about 30 or 40  minutes after the suns set completely  liam what time does the sun set  travis oh jesus christ garmin over here  laura are you trying to figure out if the stores are still open  
dung	 liam does it look dark of course i am  marisha we cant ask siri here we dont know  liam thats the feat i took its siri does it look like stores are open thats all im asking  matt yeah probably i mean in this district shops are still open past sundown for a little  bit but the later in the evening it gets many of them close down some shops stay open later you  dont know  liam lets go to this room party you are talking about  sam wait to get the spider 
none	 inside the hotel well need a clever disguise for it a hat a  beard perhaps  laura good call ill get out my disguise kit and put a mustache on the spider  liam also nott mask up for sure yeah for sure maybe earmuffs its very cold  sam i could do a spell and make myself look like someone else  liam that did not work very well for me several hours ago i think maybe you want to use tangible  things here use the earmuffs use the hat use the mask  sam mask and 
dung	 earmuffs should make me look just perfect  liam you also have a hood so its nighttime with the hood up in the dark yeah  sam i like it  laura its really bright and shiny in the hotel though  travis if i may you raise a good point nott if we for some reason get caught being where were  not supposed to i think that writ only allows us to kill this beast and return it for the coin  liam yeah were not supposed to be here  travis i would not want to gamble 
none	 with our reward of 700 gold perhaps we should leave and collect  our reward and then find our revelries elsewhere  marisha i mean to be fair we know how to get here through the sewers now we can always come back  travis this is a good point  laura should we just make it straight  marisha make a beeline  laura just go straight and just stay  travis we can walk  laura yeah lets go straight out and leave and go to the crownsguard  travis yeah the kings hall  marisha lets do 
town	 it  laura maybe we should shut the gate up and then lock it  sam good idea  laura so they dont know  matt so you remark it you close it you guys step out into the main street and youve traveled  through here before you immediately think oh thats where the nearest exit gate in the  direction of the hall would be you guys get about a block before two of the patrolling crownsguard  stop and look at this troupe of people walking with a giant brutalized spider bright white and blue  travis 
none	 dinner  matt immediately jogs up both of them excuse me what are you doing here  laura oh yes dont worry were staying at the pillow trove but we have this very beautiful writ  matt takes the writ and they both look at it the other one has his hand on the side of his  blade each looking very closely at each of you and you are a motley lot going through all of  you sneering a bit in the direction of caleb  liam i have a hood on  matt yeah a bit frightened 
none	 at the vision of yasha and confused at the sight of mollymauk he  finishes reading the writ okay very well but we will escort you to the gates and you can  continue this on to the hall  laura thank you  matt how did you get this in here  laura oh we are really powerful  marisha were the mighty nein  laura we killed it we took care of the monster problem  matt looks back at the other guard and they share a brief glance right very well let us  leave then they 
none	 escort you towards the entrance the opening gate where you guys had  passed through you move through and out into the interstead sprawl at the exact gates where you  guys had entered or you had entered and you had attempted the night before  liam yeah on the way there too i also turn to one of these guards and say excuse me could you  point me where we are right now which way to the nestled nook from here youve heard of this bookstore  matt i didnt well the nestled nook did you say  
none	 liam you dont have to pretend with me its fine  matt he points over that way he goes to the south side of the silken terrace look for the  small greenish hutlooking building  liam thank you  laura were going to clean up well be back this is not normally how we dress ugh we were in  the sewers  matt they escort you out laughs get you quickly out of the district carrying a giant  bloodied awfullooking spider as youre making your way some of the folks that are walking  through start gasping 
none	 at the sight and whispering to each other pointing some begin to approach  and somebody else grabs their shoulder and pulls them back you become this slowmoving sight  through this district  travis yeah mighty nein stay back nein  laughter  matt all right you guys eventually make your way back to the hall  liam you know i grew up with this language  travis yeah  matt so youre outside the kings hall as you approach some of the guards rush up to you and  hail what do you carry and bring here to 
none	 the what is this thing  taliesin these papers oh thats a spider  laura the evil monster that was killing everything  marisha yeah you might want to send someone to collect your dead too by the by  travis and taliesin quite a few  matt you bring him in some more of the guards begin to gather around and then voloshin is pulled  from his interior office somewhere as he steps forward he says all right they tell meoh  goodness me thats a beastie he tugs on the end of his chin beard for a 
none	 second so this is it  this is the one  travis indeed in fact it would turn invisible when it wasnt trying to stick its fangs into all  of our gang  matt shouting someone wake up cloen  marisha who the hell is cloyde  matt cloen and he was the one survived  marisha cloyde  matt cloen  ashley cloyne  marisha cloine  matt cloen  marisha that is not what i heard at all  travis with that accent all those letters disappear  taliesin theres also an egg sac that got taken

none	 the  doors on the left side of the building a human woman comes through in her early 60s oncebrown  hair has turned mostly gray and shoulderlength its curled up a bit into a soft bob on the sides  shes older her face is weathered and has seen some time shes wearing robes of gold and white  but they seem to be not ceremonial or at least worn  enough to the point where they look like theyre worn for  comfort she steps forward and she has these warm brown eyes that peek through this face 
town	 sorry to  bother all of you word just came to me that you were successful in taking care of this beast in  the sewers i am lawmaster orentha and i just wanted to extend my thanks its not often that  folks are willing to go to lengths and put their lives on the line for the honor of those fallen of  the crownsguard and those within the hall of the king so i just wanted to say i appreciate that  travis of course we appreciate the law in this town and the services you provide 
none	 you can lean  on us for any further needs you might have  matt the crown appreciates it the people of the city appreciate it and i appreciate it thank  you she turns around and shuffles back into the hallway everyone goes about their business again  and begins shoving you off towards the door  laura she seemed really nice  travis yeah  sam why did all those people want to rebel against her  marisha shes still a part of the crownsguard shes still a part of the system  sam she seems nice though 
none	  marisha yeah theyre nice individually sometimes but theyre still a part of a shitty  whole a real shithole  laura and travis a shitty hole  sam theres not a lot of shades of gray in your world are there its just shit or not shit  marisha its been a long day  travis laughs a shitty hole  matt whats the casting time on identify again  liam as a ritual its 11 minutes  matt you guys would be exiting the building just as youve finished that process you complete it  take a moment

none	 minute we  get inside should we go and see pumat sol and see if hell make us clean  travis we do have some extra coin maybe hes got some fancier shit to buy  liam also as long as were in here i couldnt get in earlier but were here now there is a  stop i wanted you to go with me  laura were not in the trispires anymore  liam where are we now  matt you guys are back at the kings hall back in the interstead sprawl  liam thats a bummer

none	  marisha yeah thats fine but time of day  liam time of day i know thats part of the feat i know the hour of the day  marisha thats bananas you should be able to look at the sun and say oh six  liam i am so cheating by following the rules in the book  matt i know right now its close to 830 900 its still early eveningish  taliesin dinner and bad decisions and cleanliness would be great  laura we have to get not stinky before we eat okay  travis agreed should 
none	 we head back clean up  sam sounds good  matt you guys easy enough find your way back to the leaky tap where you can utilize the washroom  to get yourselves back to a personable state  liam on the stroll fjord  travis yeah  liam i want to talk to you about how that went back there can we walk alone for a minute  travis sure if youd like  liam lets drag back two things one is i didnt bring it up even though maybe beauregard  knows but i found something in there 
none	 that i think is up your alley i found some armor beyond just  crownsguard armor down there i mean listen my friend you spit out salt water youve got a  sword thats covered in fucking anemones and shit  travis im not repeating that word  liam this armor is like the little mermaid armor its all for you i found it but i would like to  trade it for you yeah you have that glove and i know i handed it over willingly just yesterday  but i have a checkered past and an interesting history 
none	 with flame fire theres no real reason  youd be very good with that glove but i feel like i would like to have that glove and i would  love for you to have this armor i took a look at it while you guys were inside and it would allow  you to move freely in the ocean or in rivers or lakes underwater and keep you safe in water  travis wow wish i had that before yeah i think a trade would be fine but ill trade you for a  story of why your past 
none	 is so checkered with flame you seem to trust in me enough to tell me about it  liam i dont trust you yet i dont trust any of these people yet except for no i dont trust  any of these people yet  travis thats too bad  liam ja ive made mistakes in my life ive harmed people not in a long time you know i  thought i was going to be something someday a long time ago and now i dont oh god ask me  again in a couple of days i will prepare 
none	 an answer that is better than this for you i promise  travis sure you know weve all harmed people but i hope that you will learn to trust me in  time and i appreciate you sharing that here im fairly certain that you will do far more damage  with this than my shitty attempt did  liam thank you  travis of course thanks for the armor what does it look like  laughter  matt its a darker gray but elements of where its been pressed in with leather scrolling  designed to look almost like 
none	 waves curling on the outer parts of the different leather plates have  a very faint turquoise inlay color on the inside that you can only see when its directly lit it  looks like a very beautiful set of leather armor theres no arms to it other than the bracer  plates right there theres no sleeve there you go its got an arm guard and a bracer there  shoulder piece the torso portion a couple of plates that go over that and some leg guards  travis all good things thank you for this  liam thank 
tavern	 you no youve go to go higher  travis yeah youre welcome  marisha dont want to interrupt your broment  liam oh hi you want to be part of the bro moment or a beau moment  marisha im not here i am not here  liam i thought you were i thought youd walked up  laura are we going to bed or are we what  matt what are you guys doing  travis were going to get clean first because good god were going to clear out that fucking  tavern  matt well say you 
none	 got clean for the expediency of the story we dont have to roleplay through  your bathing individually  travis but matt  matt unless you really want to always stop me if you want to have a moment  liam we went to the bathhouse to get clean  matt no you went back to the leaky tap  liam by the way part of the reason i didnt wash up at the leaky tap is because in medieval times  they didnt have baths i thought this isnt the sheraton they dont have a bath  laura were 
none	 pretending that theres a bath  matt this isnt medieval times in the fantasy world its a weird mixture of different time  periods and when i say they have a washroom i mean its a basin with water that is replaced  every couple hours that people communally come up and wash in its not the cleanest water and its  probably been used by other people as well and if you bathe fully in it it might be changed before  the next two or three people use it  liam i was under the assumption that you 
tavern	 had to be de rolo level to have a bath in your house  matt in your house they have one washroom for the multitude of rooms the entire tavern has and  the water is changed every few hours maybe thats what im saying but its functional  laura thats why we should have gone to pumat sols  taliesin thats why people have bathhouses to clean up  sam when fjords taking a bath im going to go through his stuff and try to find his letter  laura his letter  sam the letter for the solstryce 
none	 academy  matt okay go ahead and make a stealth check  sam not good 15  matt 15  would you have taken your stuff in with you  taliesin or would i still be in the room  matt molly would probably still be in the room  sam i got to stealth past molly or get him out of the room  matt you do make a perception check molly  travis im certainly not trying to hide it  taliesin lets call that a 20  matt you watch as nott slowly creeps into the room 
tavern	 heading over towards fjords pack  sam ooh  taliesin whatcha doing  sam yells  theres no liquor in here oh boy i better go down to the bar  taliesin what were you looking for  sam nothing liquor  taliesin were you looking for this i hold up a folded piece of paper  sam gasps  taliesin what will you give me for it  sam ill give you a whole gold piece  taliesin no something i dont want money i want something give me something  sam two gold pieces  taliesin not gold

none	 salt water every morning i  would be grumpy  taliesin maybe if he spends more time around beau hell get grumpier  sam you know what i think he is grumpy but he stands next to beau so much that he looks happy  laughter  travis grumpyass wingman makes me look better in comparison  matt i mean  taliesin thats a fair point i stand up dont go through my things i know everything i have  and i walk out the door and i walk by him shes going through your stuff by the way  
tavern	 travis who which one  taliesin ive already walked away  travis i shuffle in with like a towel nott what the fuck  laughter  travis get out  sam im sorry  travis shoo shoo  laughter  travis son of a bitch  taliesin i am downstairs having a drink  laughter  matt all right you finish your baths you all convene down in the tavern yeah when you guys  come down there and begin to reconvene about two tables away you see sitting alone with a tankard  a familiar dwarven figure to both 
none	 beau and fjord  marisha oh wait  matt ulog who you had met before  sam ulog  matt ulog with a g  marisha oh ulog not lok  sam the dwarf from the knights of requital  travis oh with the buzzed head  matt yeah you watch as you guys approach and as soon as you all gather at the table he gets up  and walks over  marisha he was the one who was super notcool with us being there super angry  matt he seemed to be yeah  marisha wife illiana into 
dung	 it  matt he walks behind where fjord and beau are and goes dont mean to bother you but if i could  have a moment of your time id like to talk  travis of course  marisha yeah man  matt excuse us he leads you guys back to where the cellar is  travis quietly dont talk  matt you guys head back he nods over towards your dragonborn bartender gives him a nod walks  past leads you down to the same cellar its dark in there theres no light but he lights a hooded  
town	 lantern as you enter and it gives this low mysterious atmosphere in the shadows as he spins  around and goes  ive been watching you a bit youre a curious lot more of you than came to the meeting five  more did you and please be honest im good at telling otherwise did you reveal any of our  sentiments to your of our moot to your companions  marisha no we did not  matt went and saw you come back to town with this spiderbeast you had on your shoulders now  thats take it youre 
none	 pretty good with a sword maybe with a bow experienced whats your skill  sets if i might ask beyond just being curious  travis well we come from all sorts of different backgrounds i happen to be very handy at sea  know my way around a merchant area beau  marisha i consider being curious a pretty high skill set but since youre asking beyond that  im pretty good with this here bo pretty good fighter named beau its a little redundant to  be totally honest  matt thats a little strange not going to lie 
none	  marisha its kind of obnoxious  matt yeah  marisha sometimes it irritates me  matt understood  marisha yeah  matt curse upon ye who made that decision for you  marisha cant pick them  laughter  matt so you can move quickly without a ruckus you say  travis at times we can be quite quiet  matt and your friends do they share our sentiments  travis i would say its safe to say that they dont have sentiments opposed to yours  marisha indifference is a pretty strong sentiment  matt sighing listen if 
none	 you indeed have a heart for goodness in this world and you want to  make a difference were moving on to something soon that i think we could use your aid on you  and your companions blast if you need payments ive got coin i can muster and i see you do work  for coin i have few others of us who can chip in as well other than myself most of the knights of  zadash are unskilled in the ways of the arm were willing to raise a voice but not much of a fist 
none	  or backing up a word with strength im willing to make it worth your time  you dont have to answer now tomorrow at midnight me and a few others from the group the  decision makers were meeting back down here if youre in bring your friends we can all talk  give you more information about whats going on and you can say yes or no at your leisure but i  think we have a chance to really do something good in this city to change part of the status quo to  root out some 
town	 of the unworthy at the top think on it  travis just letting you know that coin always helps but we did see the posting outside the  kings hall about uprisings against the empire it seems the heat on your group might be quite intense  matt were not against the empire it protects us there are good things about it what were  against are the people that abuse the system there are a handful in this town and their time is up  travis what cancers are you looking to remove i would tell you that tomorrow 
none	 night the devil lies  in the details and that will depend  matt your curiosity is piqued come by well talk  marisha what makes you think that now is the right time for all of this  matt well weve been talking for a very long time and there is a shift coming that we want to  ride the wave of ill let dolan tell you the details tomorrow anyway he snuffs the lantern  good night  travis good night  marisha shouting oh god stubbed my toe  travis wow that was really good like

none	 or not the  empire is going to look at it as fucking with them and that never ends well  travis thats right if its amateur hour were going to be shooting ourselves in the foot  marisha last thing we want to do is take the fall for these assholes  travis no joke especially since we just got here  marisha and hes talking like he wants us to be the fist to his voice what the fuck is that  travis yeah what the fuck  marisha and travis sigh  travis beer  marisha yeah

none	  sam wow  laura oh hi guys  travis hey  marisha sup  travis i wasnt sure what our next engagement might be but it seems like we might not have to  wait that long  sam did we get another job offer  travis well not through the city per se but remember that group that we joined the other day  laura the cult the orgy cult  travis no that is not at all no no we joined their meeting right we did not join them we  didnt participate  marisha we sampled

none	 wings off flies you kick a cat what is wrong  with you  laura wait a minute is it wrong to pick wings off flies because thats not  travis thats really hard to do very small and hard to catch  laura not if theyre already dead then you can pick the wings off super duper easily  taliesin oh sure if theyre already dead just go for it  marisha you know what we used to do as kids we used to take fireflies and crush them and make  glow jewelry when theyd light up and 
none	 youd crush them right as they light up and then you  can make glowing war paint  laura whats a firefly  marisha its a thing that happens on the east coast  travis and in the south  marisha yeah its a southern thing  liam and in new jersey  laura oh wow  taliesin is this a thing that really happens  liam on second thought who am i to judge its fine you know frumpkin will be back tomorrow  morning because i am going to stay up late and do what i have to

tavern	 but you paid for it  liam you paid for it you know you dont want it to go to waste theres probably a very nice  sitting room or tavern or something underneath this place its a shame to let it go to waste  laura yeah we all look nice enough they might let us in if not lets all go  ashley kill them  laura yeah  sam what what  ashley im kidding  sam oh okay  laura sure we walk back to the guards and i show them the key can we get 
none	 in  matt for the sake of brevity since its getting late and i want us to get to a good ending point  tonight they will let you in but nobody else  taliesin but she paid for the whole night with all of us  marisha its a posse  taliesin i try to look him right in the eye when i say that  matt its not the same guards you met before and they take your key but they look towards the  rather roughlooking large scary barbarian woman they look towards the very shiftylooking  
none	 multicolored tiefling they look past the while he is wearing a cloak still rough grimylooking  wizard and they begin to fixate directly on the tiny green but white maskskinned halfling  creature thing in earmuffs thats squinting very hard and they begin to really pry in that  direction before you start thinking this is not going to go well if i keep going  laura all right  marisha well maybe dont let us hold you down if you want to go enjoy  laura oh i dont really want to stay in there alone  travis how 
tavern	 about we dive bar it tonight then  marisha being alone is sucky right  taliesin roll for random bar  matt you know one dive  laura the evening nip  taliesin no work lets go make an ass of ourselves at the evening nip  marisha okay no questions just scouting them out yeah yeah  taliesin scout it out i think thats a great idea  liam singing bar wars nothing but bar wars  matt all righty let me pull this up real fast easy enough to find you head to another section  of the 
tavern	 interstead sprawl  marisha have we been here yet  matt no you have not been you come to what is a small darkwood rough and tumble dive bar with  two very dangerouslooking guards at the outside you see these thicker human guys one who is  completely bald pale skin big square chin that looks like its been broken in multiple places who  has his arms crossed the other one looks to be a spindly guy whos sitting there daggers sheathed  on both sides and they both watch you as you enter and they both just 
tavern	 stare  marisha theyre bouncers like rough bouncers at that bar  matt yeah which is interesting because you expect for them to go through that it would be a  really rowdy place but its very quiet you walk inside and aside from the central candlelit  chandelier that is almost obtrusively laid from a low ceiling with a number of small booths that are  built out of wood as well it has a classic oldengland pub feel but everything smells of  dried beers and ale and rotted wood you only see two other patrons in there 
none	 that are at separate  booths drinking alone and across the way you see this very very old dwarf with half of his beard  burned away and this perpetual grimace hes sitting there looking out as you enter he perks  up aye can i help you  marisha hes the bartender  matt yeah  marisha well take a round of your house ale if you dont mind  travis start a tab were looking to tie one on tonight were celebrating  matt if i can ask what youre celebrating  travis killed a fucking giant invisible 
tavern	 spider friend  matt thats a pretty good reason to celebrate drinks coming right up he goes and gets you guys  a number of drinks the basest most bitter ale youve had but its functional  travis i appreciate that can i ask your name  matt they call me clive  marisha clive  matt clive bens and this is my bar  travis nice to meet you clive  matt pleasure as well  travis noticed some toughlooking types out front  matt never be too careful dangerous times riots breaking out in the cities in the

none	 to thed who you  met earlier  laura maybe you should ask him about his tattoos since you have tattoos as well  taliesin just because someone has tattoos doesnt mean they know everyone who has a tattoo these  are very different tattoos  travis does the floor look barren wood any rugs coverings  liam how big is this place  matt this place is maybe 20 feet by 30 feet its very small the floor appears to be wood boards  there are a couple doors that leave into a kitchen or storage area its a 
none	 tiny fucking dive  laura like unless were going to do this we should get out  sam should we just do this then  travis we did a little recon  marisha yeah maybe we finish our drink and move on for now  laura just go back to the leaky tap and then you know  taliesin we learned something today  travis have we slept after our spider bite  matt you guys finish your terrible ale and you leave  laura this is awful and i dont want it  marisha i pound it for her
