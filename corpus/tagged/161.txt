king on  tonights episode of critical role  dramatic music  matt welcome back so last we left off /none/ vox machina after spending the better part of a  number of months traversing the prime material plane and planes beyond in search of ancient  relics known as the vestiges of divergence they finally increased their abilities theyve made  allies and theyve begun their trek to tear down the collection of evil chromatic dragons known as  the chroma conclave that destroyed your city of emon and took over most of the continent of  taldorei and beyond youve defeated and youve slain three members of the conclave allied with a  fourth and youve made your way /none/ along with an army combined with the powers of fort daxio and  syngorn to the central city of emon utilizing aid from the ashari people to cover the skies as  the armies began to assault the outer walls you along with zahra kashaw jarett gilmore the  whole party everyones there kima  travis britney spears nsync  sam my other brother  matt drakes staying back with the army to help them with the assault you guys made your way  underneath through the sewer system made a brief alliance with some wayward clasp who led you /town/ to  the center of town where the volcanic essence of thordaks mutated draconic form has been pulling  volcanic activity up beneath the city you climbed out on top and there at the walled gates to the  central cloudtop district which thordak now calls his home and his lair you saw two fire giants  guarding the entrance kashaw and zahra in a heroic display bound the giants to place and  decided to take care of them while you rushed into the fray bursting through the door due to the  strength of your titanstone gauntlets you /dung/ rushed into the cloud smoke and emberfilled cloudtop  district ruins jumping from ruined building to wreck of rubble and stone the air itself is dense  and black with dark fume and its hard to see anything you all carefully gingerly stealthily  made your way into the alcove of one ruined building where across the way you see a giant  raised central cavern a hole a burrow if you will that is close to 40 feet across apparently  your approach was somewhat sensed by the red dragon himself as you watch thordak emerge from  this /none/ burrow and climb out saying to itself it appears we have visitors  sound of liquid pouring  sam im really nervous  laughter  matt so as ashley unfortunately can not be with us pikes control and duty will be taken care of  by the twins for the evening you guys will be dual clericing tonight  laura were jaegering  matt indeed at this point in time you guys are all keeping as still and as quiet as you can while  figuring out your circumstances you can hear the low growling voice of thordak as he /none/ begins to scan  the vicinity growling  marisha potions potions  sam oh good idea good idea  laura i take fire resistance  matt fire resistance fire resistance fire resistance  liam am i able to make a jello shot of invulnerability and haste at the same time  laura but you know they only last for one minute each just wait for like a second just wait fire  resistance lasts for a while i passed them out so if youve got them take them  matt okay so we have scanlan keyleth vex grog all with /none/ fire resistance and percy all  right thats pretty much everyone but you i believe right  laura oh but hes got the armor  matt so yeah the entire party thank god is set to resist fire that may help your chances here  as you all guys quietly begin to drink and figure out your circumstances  travis why are you laughing whyd you laugh  matt because i was rolling thordaks perception check to see if he noticed any of your presences  as you were drinking the potions i got a natural one  laura wow /none/ just drinking a potion would make him notice us  liam i guess ill go back to sleep now  matt hes still scanning and hes still like we can sense you here where are you and you hear  heavy footsteps  sam should i cause a distraction  laura i cast pass without a trace on all of us  matt okay what are the components of that spell lets take a look here  laura it cant be vocal because its pass without a trace oh no its verbal  matt yep  laura no i dont /none/ do that i dont know what those things mean  travis you better get your shit in gear  laura its a whisper tell me its a one tell me its a one  matt that was not a one  travis i mean lets be clear what are we really going to hide from look where his fucking head  is hes like the sun we aint hiding from that shit  laura he may have heard us but now weve got plus ten stealth  matt so as you guys are all quietly huddled over in this broken /none/ space there vexahlia begins to do  her incantation beneath her breath and as you feel the shadows cling to you you hear in the  distance ah there you are  travis i just want to pee on myself and run  matt he has currently moved out to this area and began to asses the scenery i need all of you to  roll initiative  screaming  laura already take your potions  liam i cant were into initiative right its too late for potions  matt you took your fire resistance potions thats all you had /none/ time to do  marisha thats not too bad not too bad  taliesin that will do  laura whos rolling for pike  liam ill do it i got 11 plus what  laura i dont think she has anything so  matt pike has no bonus  travis 14 oh wait you ask them in order  laura im freaking out shit im sorry i thought i was helping  matt vex what did you get  laura 13  matt 13 for you all right  liam 12 and pike got 11  taliesin pretty good for /none/ pike  laura and marisha that is pretty good for pike  matt keyleth  marisha 17  laura good  marisha yeah its pretty good for keyleth oh god  matt percy  taliesin 25 fast fast  sam eight ill be bringing up the rear thats how i like it anyway  liam while were cowering here pike says guys i think i could really help you out if you wait a  second okay  laura oh pike didnt even get a chance to  travis were we supposed to have a heroes feast  laura we /town/ did we did have a heroes feast  travis im so glad i was totally here last week  laura were all immune to fear and poison still we all have advantage on wisdom  matt you do indeed  taliesin and extra hit points  matt all righty so with that beginning of the round at the very top percival you glance around the  corner and you see sifting through the large columns of smoke that are billowing off each one  of these destroyed burning buildings you see the gargantuan form of thordak heavy footsteps and  /none/ looks right over you see all of a sudden as his eyes pass in your direction almost like a cat  caught in a light beam as his eyes flare up with bright white light as it sees your presence  taliesin okay  travis what do you see  taliesin its coming is there room can i get even vaguely a shot in that room  matt from here at his size you could get a shot if you moved a little bit  taliesin ill move a little bit  matt jump between these folks there  taliesin /none/ i have spider climb on right now so actually ill climb up on the wall and then climb  back down when im done  matt okay  taliesin im going to ignore that ive been drinking first of all im going to cast hex on  him because thats really going to make a difference  travis no it is stay positive  taliesin what kind of checks should i im going to down him for  marisha i feel like hes real good at everything  laura like wisdom or something  taliesin im going to give him /none/ a disadvantage on dexterity checks because fuck it all right im  going to take out bad news and im going to take two shots which is my way with hex and bad news  and hopefully everythings going to go just fine im going to use sharpshooter and im going to use  deadeye on the first one im going to drop a point on deadeye so deadeye roll that should  have counted damn it i shouldnt have picked it up oh thank god thats sorry im blanking  26 to hit  matt that hits  travis /none/ thats a good sign  taliesin yeah lets not start saying that now and thats wow im nervous  sam wow  taliesin thats actually really good first shot is 21 37 points of damage plus five points of  necrotic damage  matt in addition to 37 thats nice  taliesin thats really nice i rolled really high and i have sharpshooter running  matt good opening shot  taliesin next one im going to shoot sharpshooter but no deadshot is an 18 to hit  matt nope  taliesin okay second one misses im going to crawl back /none/ and hide again and get a little bit  of yeah i got up on top took two shots and crawled back down to hide  matt all right as you climb up to the top you slam bad news over the top of the stonework and  as soon as the barrel catches a little bit of the light through the smoke you watch as thordaks  face whips over in your direction gunshot the first shot smashes across the crest on the front  of the dragons face you see sparks fly and bits of flame red crystal /none/ get shattered in the  distance the head spins back towards you and immediately you start shaking and you fire the  second shot and it ricochets off of its angry thick hide you immediately duck back behind the wall  taliesin im regretting so many things right now not you oh god i shouldnt avoid my family it  leads to dragons  matt in all of your focus and all of your attention into the arrival and the crawl into  this and thordak none of you noticed that larkin is not with you  laura no surprise /none/ there  matt keyleth youre up  laura piece of shit  marisha piece of shit okay i dont know what to do here what are we trying to do do we have a  plan should i try and burn a big spell  sam do whatever you do weve been practicing for this our whole lives  marisha okay before i do something crazy based off of percy saying that i turn to vex and i go  by the way ive been meaning to ask you about that if he ever followed through so stay alive  /none/ we can talk later okay and i pop over the corner and im going to cast tsunami  sam ive never heard you say those words  liam no its not  matt so youre casting tsunami  liam she did this once and wrecked our enemies  marisha that was tidal wave this is like a big daddy version of that  liam its worse than that  marisha this is my 8thlevel spell so i create a wall 300 feet high 300 feet long and 50 feet  thick of water  matt you watch as the smoke /none/ is instantly replaced with steam in the vicinity completely filling the  area with fog as this giant wall of water is conjured out of the broken cracked dry earth and  begins curling over towards thordaks front side all right so strength saving throw wait any  huge or smaller creature  laura is he bigger than huge  matt he is bigger than huge  laura so it doesnt have any effect on him is he bigger than 300 feet  marisha yeah hes not bigger than 300 feet is he  matt its big but the sheer /none/ mass size you watch as the tidal wave smashes into thordak and  splits and falls around him no effect his form is too big  marisha none at all  matt the water crashes against him hes too big for it to actually have an impact on him  liam are there any fires left burning in the vicinity  matt actually this fire is out now this fire goes out and water spills down into the tunnel  and you watch a bunch of steam whoosh rise out of it  marisha well its also a sixround spell /dung/ and hes supposed to get stuck in it nothing no  matt hes too big  laura he doesnt even get damaged at all though  travis does he question his choices in life  marisha because im questioning mine  matt it says any huge or smaller creature inside the wall has to make a saving throw or take  damage creature caught in the wall can move but yeah it only seems to have an effect on  sam well that was a valiant effort  matt i was with you but hey 8thlevel spell  sam you /none/ got tons of 8thlevel spells youll be fine  marisha but hey 8thlevel spell did you just say that to me  matt sorry im sorry i didnt mean to  marisha holy fuck  sam no problem  taliesin i would get back behind the wall if i were you  matt so keyleth do you want to use the rest of your movement  sam dont get back behind the fucking wall dont get back behind the wall were all bunched up go  somewhere else  travis scatter  laura i know how painful this is right /none/ now keyleth but it looked really cool just run  liam our pores are cleared the steam  taliesin the wall will at least take some damage at this point most things hes going to do are  going to be a giant area effect anyway that youre not going to be able to outrun you might as well  have cover  matt oh wait hold on  sam judges weighing in  matt sorry i scrolled past that part there each creature has to make a saving throw so it  does affect him the first round it /none/ does  marisha just on the first round though  laura still thats something  matt each turn after that so yeah basically as it gets smaller it affects less and less  creatures sorry i scrolled past that one  marisha so it just doesnt keep him restrained  matt that is a 21  sam whats your spell dc  marisha 20  matt so it takes half so roll 6d10 and it takes half damage  sam oh thats something  laura thats better than zero  marisha its better than yay 8thlevel spell to quote matt /none/ mercer  taliesin that will be our next tshirt yay 8thlevel spell  matt its fine keep digging this is my battle against you guys  marisha im not digging  laura no no not at all were very happy with that  marisha 26 35 halved  matt okay half of the 35  marisha but its not going to do anything to him on subsequent rounds  sam 17 points thats something  laura is there water all over the ground though  matt it says here that at the start of each of your turns after the /none/ wall appears the wall along  with any creatures in it move 50 feet away from you so it will move him 50 feet back unless he  gets out of it  marisha yeah it says any huge or smaller creatures must make a strength saving throw in  order to move  matt correct he can move through it fine hes too big now he doesnt take the additional damage  in following rounds  marisha so he gets to move out of it no problem is that essentially the deal  taliesin but he is picked up /none/ for 50 feet though  marisha yeah but is he moved back  matt it still has to try and make an athletics check against your spell dc to move at all but it  doesnt take any additional damage  marisha all right ill take that  matt its her first time using this spell guys so be patient were figuring this out as we go  taliesin i would say also just because pike was going to do a thing so come back for pikes thing  that she was going to do  marisha pikes going to /none/ do a thing  liam so is he  laura i feel like run marisha cause the thing that pikes going to do is  marisha is that an aoe thing that shes going to do  laura yeah but just go  marisha all right heres what im going to do im going to move in this area over here kind of  poke into this building  matt thats as far as you can get with your full movement  marisha no no i dont want to go that way i want to go behind sorry this isnt /none/ very  matt over here  marisha yes that way thank you  matt that right there is as far as you can get with your full movement  marisha yeah sure yeah  sam its going to be great  marisha its going to be so great its going to be great  matt all right that ends keyleths turn jarett is going to go ahead and rush around here pulling  out his heavy crossbow hes going to go ahead as he runs past releasing a bolt towards thordak  two bolts actually that is a nope that /none/ misses that also misses well they both hit but  they both splinter across his hide all right jaretts going to make the full move behind this  wall and begin loading another bolt its all right we got this  sam hes dead  matt it is now gilmores turn  sam shaun gilmore  laura im sorry i dont know how i just stole two pencils  liam i do  matt gilmore is going to as he watches jarett rush off and keyleth rush back around the wall  watching the wall of water crash past the /none/ dragon goes all right its been a while since ive had  to do this and he points his finger up towards the dragons head and you watch as this green  spark shoots this single green beam in the direction of the dragons face  travis please hit his face please hit his face please hit his face  laura hit him gilmore  matt lets see if it makes its dexterity saving throw that is yeah he succeeds against the  spell dc yeah he succeeds with a 19 he goes and fires and you watch as thordak /none/ sees the beam  glimmer out of the fingers and he ducks down and it fires past dodging between the side of the  head and the beam goes casting out that way no effect  travis shit hammer  laura what level spell was that gilmore  matt 6th  marisha i look at him and i go yeah 8th i feel you man  matt its okay weve got this  marisha fucking sucks bro all right lets do this  matt and hes going to go ahead and  liam i dont understand all this arcane terminology /none/  matt scatter right he pushes past and goes running this way all right thats going to end  his turn grog  travis yeah i see gilmore take off running and being theres a giant trex on the map im going  to go must go faster must go faster and i would like to run as fast as balls this way  towards this cover as far as i can for 50 feet  matt okay you get right about there as thordak has the same initiative as you  travis oh  matt thordak who has dodged /none/ the beam and is seeing the ants begin to scatter in front goes  moving targets  travis glad i joined gilmore  matt we love moving targets and hes going to step forward  laura no dont move  matt and is going to rear back and inhales whoosh and unleash flame breath  sam oh kiki youre okay  laura you made it  matt i need vex percy vax pike scanlan trinket grog and gilmore to all make dexterity  saving throws hold on to that number  taliesin does partial cover help at all  matt /none/ no the flame is like napalm  taliesin im rerolling that  matt kima fails gilmore rolls a one are you serious  laura did you roll for pike  taliesin thats a little better  sam can i cutting words to do anything  travis the ancient dragon  matt cutting words actually can reduce the damage  sam just the damage not his attack  travis well take the damage reduction  sam will it reduce the damage for everybody  matt im doublechecking that im pretty sure it does  sam if so i will do that /none/  taliesin i just had to use a resolve  laura what did you roll  taliesin a one so i had to burn a resolve which i have done  matt yeah so you can reduce the damage by a certain amount for everybody  sam it wont be much but ill do it  taliesin itll help  laura and then hes got disadvantage on something next doesnt he after you use cutting words  matt and sam yes  matt all right so  sam so as he goes i will yell at him oi what sexual /none/ position makes the ugliest children i  dont know ask your mama  laughter  matt wow thats a thing  liam i like to think of all of vox machina nervously laughing  matt she has advantage on her saving throw kima does make her saving throw all right so go  ahead and roll your d12 and it will reduce the damage  sam guys you can reduce that damage by five  laura sweet  sam so instead of 150 its 145  matt no instead of 99 points of fire damage it is 94  sam /none/ 94  matt 94 points of fire damage  laura 9d4  matt it was 99 now its 94  taliesin does the five get subtracted before we halve it or after  matt it reduces the damage of the attack  laura and then if we have fire resistance then it but what if we rolled 28 did we make our save  matt grog what was your  travis 17  matt nope  laura 28  matt yes  liam 24  matt 24  sam oh shit he has to look  matt you just make /none/ it  taliesin 24 is a just made it  liam so i take zero because im using evasion  matt yes you do  marisha i didnt have to roll  taliesin 18  matt 18 nope  sam 21  matt 21 nope  laura and trinket and pike both fail as well  matt okay thankfully thats half damage so that would be at half of 94 37 im sorry no  47 47 points of fire damage to grog to percy to scanlan  laura pike and trinket  matt well trinket does not take half /none/  sam wait i thought you said i didnt save  laura takes the full 90 trinket is in my necklace again already  matt trinket goes right into your necklace  sam wait wait so i get 94 or 47  matt you didnt succeed so you would take 94 but because you have fire resistance you take 47  sam oh okay thats not bad  matt you take half of 47 because you have fire resistance and you made the save  laura so 23 24  travis tell me he has only one of those per /none/ day  matt nope that regenerates  laura 23 or 24  matt it would be 23  sam and matthew dm do our temporary hit points go away first or last  taliesin theyre technically not temporary its actually your max increases so they can come back  matt correct they can come back yeah  taliesin you can heal into them  travis did somebody get temporary hit points  sam we all did  17 from our feast  laura oh thats right pike has i need to  taliesin youre 17 up you can go 17 /none/ up even if you lose them  travis right well im going to add them now  taliesin your max is now much higher  travis oh thank you thats much better  matt okay kimas doing okay but gilmore is looking rough as the flames burn through hyper  white red orange blazing fire you havent felt heat like this before you instinctively close  your eyes but it doesnt seem to help as the flames pass by you keyleth you can even feel the  impact from here singeing your eyebrows and you have to cover your face /none/ for fear of being  disfigured by the proximity as the fire eventually burns away gilmore is like stumbling  right now burned all around the rest of the party is already smoking bits of your outfits and  edges of clothing are now actually curling up and burning that was bad so that ends thordaks go grog  travis well being that my run was so rudely interrupted by shitchest over there can i change  course seeing that hes going to barf fire at all of us and run straight at him in a rage  matt yes /none/ you may  travis yeah can we go ahead and see how we do here and i will go reckless attack great weapon master  matt sure  laura doesnt that mean he gets advantage on his attacks against you  travis yeah i mean lets buy the ticket and take the train right who fucking knows one  better 19  matt 19 misses  travis shit roll better thats better  laura hes so big though  matt but his armor is hard  travis that is a 25  matt 25 hits so the second attack hits /none/ are you doing  travis reckless and great weapon  matt right but i mean are you doing your frenzy for the third attack or are you going regular  travis yeah im going frenzied  matt all right  travis 21  matt 21 misses but you did get a hit in  travis i do  laura oh my god what was the second attack  travis 25 so somewhere between 21 and 25 which one is the d12 this one 11 two points of  necrotic and 36 total  matt 36 nice as the flames subside /none/ from the dragon breath the flames part and you see  rushing out flames curling off the edges of the fur this angry raging goliath yells runs and  takes one swing it skids across the scales of the front of thordaks chest gleaning past the giant  scar in the center no damage thordak laughs you look up into the beaming starlike eyes and  angrily yells this time the axe sinks in and the laughter stops you see the slight twinge of  pain in the right eye of the dragon as you pull back for a third /none/ one brings its claw up and  swings down to try and crush you as you swing for your attack you instinctually realize its  probably best to let this go and you duck out of the way in time as the claw slam into the ground  in front of you  travis yeah yeah fuck that ends my turn  matt vex your turn  laura cool i click my boots of haste  matt you feel for the first time the adrenaline surge through you and you suddenly go my  brothers been hoarding this this whole /none/ time everything slows down around you ever so slightly  and for a second your minds racing faster than it normally does  laura with my full movement can i get behind the wall up where keyleth was headed  matt you can move 60 feet  laura i want to stop in a place where i can attack before i finish my move  matt youll go over there and as youre rushing past keyleth  liam as she rushes past she hears slowly those are just a loaner  laura slowly go fuck yourself okay all right im /none/ going to cast hunters mark then for my  first attack im going to try a bramble shot  matt percy by the way i need you to make a concentration check its a constitution saving throw  laura yes 30 on the first  matt that hits  taliesin ten  matt your hex fades  laura i took the bracers off right yes i did okay 15 plus two lightning damage plus two sneak  attack and a hunters mark ooh 12 plus 4d8 for the bramble shot  matt nice so already at 29 damage plus  /none/ laura 15 no 13 17  matt plus 17 all right 46 points of damage on the first strike whats the dc on the strength  saving throw  laura oh 16  matt yeah he makes it  laura that would have been amazing  matt ten plus 12 that would have been amazing as you run past and fire the first arrow it sinks  in and jams into the side of where the plates of the chest armor meet the scar as it hits you  watch it cause a spurt of dragon blood knowing exactly where /none/ the weak points of the armor are  being a person that studied dragons  laura oh thats right and an additional d6 because hes a dragon right 2d6  matt you should have the additional damage i think it was plus two damage against creatures  that are  laura oh just plus two  travis 2d20 of damage  laura i thought it was a d6 sorry youre right i think  matt do you want to go look it up  laura no its fine ill look it up between my next attack i want to try /none/ one of my poisoned  arrows  matt you see the brambles extend out from the arrow and the dragon leans forward already focused on  grog as youre slamming him in the side as his body flexes the brambles shatter  laura 27  matt 27 hits  laura okay 14 plus four lightning damage plus hunters mark is another four what is the poison  do i do anything for the poison  matt i am going to go ahead and roll a constitution saving throw for him which succeeds  so yeah he just resists the poison /none/ effects of the arrows  laura okay and then im going to do a third attack right because i am hasted  matt yep  laura and that hits too thats 31  travis damn girl  laura 16 plus another four lightning damage plus hunters mark plus two plus two because he is a  dragon but i didnt do plus two on the second one because i  matt so 24 damage that final strike nice you did almost 100 points of damage in a single round  cheering  laura and then i finish my round of /none/ movement and i keep running behind the building yeah right  there i know  matt as you rush past looking up into the face of the creature that you know for certain seeing  it there that this is the creature that brought your mother to her end and half the city of  byroden to the south and as that anger swells into you and mixes with the surge of adrenaline in  your body and you dont even feel the momentum your hands instinctively go through all training  all the years that have gone by as /none/ each arrow gets loosed there is just kind of this fuzz this  kind of numbness around as your hatred is focused so clear on this dragons head and then the air  rushes back into your lungs and you slam your back into the wall preparing for your next round all  right that finishes vexs go vax and lady kima go at the same time what do you want to do  liam i am going to down the potion of healing with a bonus action  matt okay  liam and then now i have two actions /none/ because of the potion  matt the potion of healing  liam no no haste so thats bonus action now i have two actions because of the potion  matt correct  liam second actions used to pump out the wings  matt okay wings are up  liam then i am going to fly directly towards thordaks face to you dont need that to ten  feet away from him to his face you can just hold it for a second and cast vow of enmity at him  matt all righty  liam and then i am going /none/ to barrel roll back fly and land hard right down next to my sister  where shes hiding  matt okay at a nonhasted fly speed  liam 120 hasted  matt oh because you are hasted with the potion so yeah not a problem land right next to your  sister  sam so you prayed at him good job  matt you swoop up right in front you cast the vow of enmity  liam he could have taken a swipe at me im just glad he didnt  matt oh but we are going to get there /none/ as you swoop up within ten feet of his face and cast the  vow focusing on him the dragon grins and as you pull out of his attack space because he has a  reach of 15 feet with his bite he is going to take a bite attack at you that is a 32 to hit  liam can i uncanny dodge this  matt you can  liam yeah i have to  travis 32 to hit  laura were fucked  matt thats actually a bad roll 17 points of piercing damage plus  liam i /none/ knew it was going to happen  matt plus 16 points of fire damage reduced to half  liam no 17 plus 16 total  matt well because you have fire resistance that is reduced  liam okay so eight and 17 25  matt yes 25 points of damage to you  liam gives me advantage on every attack  laura oh thats great  liam i will get sneak attack on every attack whether theres someone next to him or not  laura thats good  taliesin good thats really good  matt kima is going to  /none/ sam who that who that is that kima  matt thats kima kima cant do too much at this distance unfortunately she is going to cast aura  of vitality on herself  sam on herself  matt correct what that does is allows her to heal people as a bonus action for as long as it  lasts which is pretty damn helpful right now let me pull it up real fast lets see aura of  vitality she can use a bonus action to cause a creature in the aura including herself to regain  hit points shes /none/ doing okay she looks over at gilmore whos hurt on the ground staggering over  in flames as she rushes up casts the spell on herself holding her holy symbol of bahamut to her  chest she looks up at the dragon remember me without even losing her vision she puts her hand  out like this and you watch as a beam of divine energy streaks out slams into gilmores side he  almost doubles over as it swirls around his body and heals his wounds for 2d6  sam okay  matt so he heals four hit points /none/  sam hes looking better  matt all right that is going to end kimas turn pikes turn  sam by committee  laura okay were going to move to the corner of the building that shes standing in  liam inside squished into the corner  matt okay ten feet of movement to get there  laura yes shes going to as a bonus action cast spiritual weapon at fifth level  liam okay ill mark that off  taliesin go nuts with it yeah  matt what else is she doing this round  laura and then shes /none/ also going to cast beacon of hope  matt beacon of hope is a 3rdlevel spell if you are casting a 3rdlevel or higher spell as an  action you can only do a 2ndlevel spell as a bonus action so you can either do beacon of hope  and then a 2ndlevel spiritual weapon or  laura so we should do beacon of hope and not do spiritual weapon because we want to do a higher  spiritual weapon later  liam so anyone within 30 feet of her is getting some nice things  laura so anybody within /none/ 30 feet gets advantage on wisdom which you already have but you get  advantage on death saving throws as well  liam and the best part  laura is any time youre healed youre automatically healed to the max possible amount  sam what do you mean any time youre healed  liam when someone heals you you dont roll you calculate the maximum amount you could possibly roll  laura and thats what youre healed for  taliesin so if its 3d4 you just get 12 thats amazing  sam do we get any healing from this as /none/ well  laura no this is a prep spell this is something that probably we should have done before thordak  started attacking us  sam yeah well youre not pike you dont know  liam so dm who all gets that looks like grog is just out of reach of it  matt within 30 feet of her grog is just out of the radius gilmore kima  laura should we have run around the corner if we had run around the corner would grog get  matt if you run to there okay yeah that would get grog /none/ gilmore scanlan percy keyleth it  does not get either of you  laura well thats fine  marisha this looks bad but i feel okay about this  matt so thats your action  laura and that gets pike in that as well  sam you get a bonus action  laura bonus action  sam you can do a healing word  laura oh thats right healing word  matt you can do up to a level two  laura okay so she should do a healing word is healing word a level two  taliesin you can /none/ do it at any level you like  liam percy needs it grog needs it  laura grog needs it  travis yeah i took like 40 points of damage  laura i feel like hes okay still so percy  taliesin one of the two of us i would say  marisha i didnt get hit im good  taliesin oh ill take it how much do i get back  laura at a level two thats 2d4  matt 2d4 plus five  taliesin 13  marisha is that for everybody or just for her  laura everybody /none/  matt anyone who is affected by the spell all healing is maximum for as long as it lasts and  its concentration okay that ends pikes turn pike can technically move five more feet from  where she is  laura but she cant hide though  matt no shes out in the open right now scanlan youre up  sam ill move ten feet towards that way still ducking behind that stone there i will inspire  percy wait should i heal or inspire ill inspire percy ill sing him a lovely christmas  song singing you know /none/ raishan and vorugal the frigid doom brimscythe and umbrasyl we killed in  his room but do you recall the most fuckedup dragon of all thordak the cinder king had a  very shiny gem and if you ever saw it run the fuck away from him  matt take your d12 inspiration die  taliesin all right d12 is awesome  matt bards are great all right thats your bonus action  sam and for the move i guess ill attack him i dont do that very well ill do bigbys hand  sings bigbys hand at level seven /none/  marisha oh shit  matt 7thlevel bigbys hand  taliesin were just going to spraypaint matts hand purple and hes going to sit there punch things  liam check out the big hand on scan  matt where do you want bigbys hand to appear within 120 feet  sam i guess keep it low just go for the ball shot yeah  matt all right so what are you having the hand do  sam punch just punch  matt so clenched fist and that is with plus 2d6 for each sorry plus 2d8 for each slot above /none/  fifth that is an additional 4d8 that is 8d8 if it hits go ahead and roll your spell attack  sam 18  matt 18 no the fist gleans off of thordaks chin the dragon just kind of grins growls is  this all youve got  sam actually yes that is my biggest thing so yes  matt good all right that brings us back to the top of the order now at the top of this  round were going to start doing lair actions  laura no  taliesin lair actions are the worst  matt /none/ it happens after percys turn though  taliesin oh good  matt so percy your go  taliesin fine  laura make sure he dies before he gets anything else  liam pull out your dragon gun  taliesin my dragon gun  marisha were going to be real disappointed if you cant take this all on your own  sam wait a second matt doesnt he get a disadvantage on his save because of my cutting words  matt that wasnt a save that was your attack  sam yeah thats what i meant  matt on the next /none/ saving throw he has to make he has a disadvantage yes  sam making sure you guys know how spells work  travis yep thank you i was confused  sam jesus sam 3 why didnt you tell me that  matt percy what are you doing  taliesin im going to take a deep breath and shoot directly north or i suppose to you it would  be south down the map towards that building on the far corner im just going to run in that  direction  matt as far as you can get with your full /none/ move  taliesin thats as far as i can get with my full movement and he has to recharge his fire probably  before he can do that again  matt yeah when it comes back to his turn i have to roll to see if he gets it that round  taliesin okay thats fine im going to take two shots while im running im going to just  because im not feeling lucky right now im going to burn another deadeye on my first run so lets  do that  marisha are you feeling lucky  taliesin /none/ no no i am really not so less so that im not even going to do sharpshooter thats  awesome i take that back  marisha percy you should have done it  taliesin its okay actually that doesnt affect the crit at all sharpshooter isnt affected by a  crit i critted by the way sorry thats nice so hey i get that deadeye back thats cool  travis you should have said that first and wed all go yay  taliesin this is like bad college theater no one knows when to applaud excellent thats oh my  /none/ god thats kind of nice 1d12 2d12 3d12 4d12  liam nice actually not bad pretty good this makes me happy this is going to be funny  taliesin pretty good thats not great but itll do 24 points of damage and im going to take  another shot you know what screw it lets put a sharpshooter on this actually no never mind  yes im going to put a sharpshooter on this i am so nervous im putting a sharpshooter on it which  is good because i rolled  sam you have an inspiration  taliesin 17 /none/ 18 19 26  matt 26 hits  taliesin yay and thats 2d12 yay boo but thats okay 30 points of damage  matt nice so both shots as you are running past you watch as it slams into the sides  causing a little explosion out of the side of thordaks armor the scales slip for a second the  second shot smashes a small hole in one of the wings but you watch as the leather seems to be  largely unaffected by the impact its already tattered at the bottom anyway but well done  taliesin highpitched /none/ noises okay  matt so there you are at the end of your turn thordaks going to go ahead and use one of his  legendary actions to do a tail attack against grog right now because youre within range  travis yeah test your might oh no please dont sobs  matt thats going to be a 25 to hit  travis it hits  matt yep you take 22 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to half so 11 points of  bludgeoning damage to you grog  travis yeah its good  matt all right that ends that /none/ at this point now you watch as through the clouds this winged  figure comes and crashing lands on this distant building the flames flickering out  laura moment of truth moment of truth  matt as the impact happens you watch as thordak turns and grins there you are oh youre going  to taste so good raishan grins from the side not to worry my king  sam oh shit that doesnt sound good  laura i cant tell what shes going to do  sam is she lying shes a deceitful one  matt at this point /none/ she will let me pull it up oh there you go theres the spell sheet shes  going to go ahead and move right there gets right up onto the building that you guys are hiding  behind as you feel the rubble and rock tumble around you you look up and you can see the giant  green leathery wings unfurl she inhales her chest expanding  cheering  matt releasing a giant cloud of poisonous gas in the direction of thordak into his face suprise  motherfucker  sam we have the best friends  matt does not /none/ make his wait this is a poison oh its constitution he does make that he  takes 38 points of poison  travis 38  matt 38 points of poison damage on that one as thordak rears from the attack oh youll die  especially painfully  liam is thordy la forge poisoned there  matt no he just takes poison damage  liam no disadvantage i really just wanted to say thordy la forge  taliesin of course you did  matt all righty so that ends raishans turn raishans like now get in circle and finish this  /none/ marisha wait raishan said that  matt yes  travis no that was lady kimas voice  laughter  liam clarota is that you on a flying steed  marisha i turn to raishan and say i dont take orders from you im only doing this because its  a good plan and then i run in if i run my full movement can i get into touch range with him  matt you can yes  marisha okay angry at what happened before and realizing that not a lot is probably going to work  unless i get ballsy /none/ i run in guns blazing and i am going to do contagion on him  matt okay  marisha im going to attempt slimy doom  all ooh  marisha in honor of zahra and her teaching us about hentai  travis yup i saw that hentai  sam we hear zahra in the distance im still alive  matt okay so make a melee spell attack against him so roll a d20 add your spell attack bonus  marisha i know im picking the right one  laura it should probably be like a black or a green or /none/ something thats like slimy  marisha ill do a green one greens good  travis or just any dice  marisha shut up travis ooh thats not too bad thats not too bad plus 12 so thats 28  matt 28 hits  marisha laughs redemption  liam keyleth is on the price is right  matt contagion well put that blue there so at the end of each of the targets turns it has to  make a constitution saving throw after failing three the disease takes effect  sam after failing three  marisha he has to fail /none/ three  matt so as youre rushing up running past the tumbling rocks and boulders of the barely standing  ceiling that raishans stepping on you rush towards thordak and getting closer you see the  immense size towering above you and getting this close there is a heated presence around him like  an aura of superheated air that burns you as you get close enough to touch him you reach out and  grab as you cast the spell under your breath and as you touch the edge of his scales its like  touching a hot iron /none/ sizzles your fingers singe upon contact but you feel the burst of druidic  energy pierce through the scales and you watch as a little bit of black power seeps into the body and  curls in between the scales and has taken root  travis whispered yes  marisha thats all i got right im going to turn grog youre still down right  travis weakly yeah  marisha im going to do a bonus healing word on grog im going to go ahead and do it at third  matt cant do third level because you cast a /none/ 5thlevel spell  marisha second level  matt all right so 2d4 plus six  marisha but its max eight plus six  matt 14 you heal 14  travis woohoo 14 points 194  matt all right at the end of your turn thordaks going to go ahead and use his next two  legendary actions to use his wing attack thordak now being surrounded by everything goes wing  flapping he begins beating his wings you watch as the flames on the ground begin to curl up into  these small tornadoes in the presence from the sheer /none/ vacuum of wind up under the wings i need  grog and keyleth and raishan to make dexterity saving throws  travis i think i have advantage on those singing because i got danger sense  marisha 12  travis natural 20  all ooh  matt so you stay put hunkering down for this keyleth you suffer 13 points of bludgeoning  damage 13 points of bludgeoning damage and six points of fire damage  marisha to three so 16 total  matt yes and you are knocked prone as the wind blows you to the ground and the /none/ dragon can move  up to half its movement speed so its going to pull back to there  sam do you get an attack grog  matt you do as you get hit by that by the way you can do retaliation or you can do your attack  of opportunity either works right now  travis yeah yeah reckless and great weapon master  matt go for it  travis eight and thats a natural 20  matt go ahead and roll your brutal damage there  sam wow thats a hit  travis 19 20 plus ten /none/ is 30 points of damage including the one point of necrotic and then i  double that  liam double all the dice  travis double all the dice right so 60  laura no double the dice  travis oh sorry okay 12 so 25 35 37  matt 37 nice  travis thanks two points necrotic  matt yes okay so as the wind beats up and the dragon begins to back up  laura did you add your plus ten because it was reckless  travis yeah  matt hovering off the ground you strike out with /none/ the technically yeah it was reckless you  cannot do great weapon master on the well i guess you can on any attack you make ill double  check on that real fast so well say thats right there  travis yeah if its a reaction im not quite sure  matt im going to double check just to make sure  travis that could have been better  laura thats okay that was a six  matt on your turn so no you cannot do that so 26 yes  sam thats great thats extra thats just bonus  /none/ matt you reach out with the axe amongst the heat and the wind blowing in your face wind blows and  strike across the front of thordaks chest as he begins to swing back with his wings beating out  all right at the end of that turn as thordak does that at the end of that turn raishans  going to use two legendary actions to cast blight on thordak  travis theres some shit going down on this map  laura oh my god matt im impressed and terrified of you for having to keep track of this /none/  liam they should really just do it already  laura i honestly had no idea what my hands were going to do  matt constitution saving throw from thordak  sam at disadvantage  matt at disadvantage thats a natural one he is going to use one of his legendary resistances  laura get rid of them  marisha burn it burn it burn that shit  sam he might have five of those  taliesin yeah and now hes got four  marisha he has three right  laura hes probably got more than three hes thordak  /none/ taliesin thordak hes got like 12  matt he takes 18 points of necrotic damage all right and because i initially forgot it lair  action  sam oh shit lair action  matt lair action indeed  laura isnt that like if you forget to move or something you dont get to do it later if you  forgot about it  sam everyone with knees dies  matt for that were going to choose  laura no no no no i was just joshing you  taliesin dont make him look things up its always going to be /none/ worse  matt the two twins that have currently ducked around the way you feel the ground nearby begin  to shake and down below you the earth cracks open and a giant column of magma explosion shoots out  and sprays in the vicinity  liam evasion  matt youve already used evasion  liam on this round its once a round this is a whole new round  matt actually youre right youre right you havent gone since then all right dexterity  saving throw from both of you  liam okay at advantage because of those boots /none/ man  laura thats good whispers okay thats good thats good  liam 23  laura 27  matt okay you both take  liam did we fail the save  matt you succeeded on the save  liam so i take zero  matt so you take zero you however take what would be 12 points of fire damage reduced to half  so six  sam scoffs you call this a lair  matt all right that ends keyleths go its now jarett jarett whos loaded up his crossbow is  going to go ahead and spin around /none/ take two shots at thordak thats a cocked die thats good 18  plus seven hits and the second one just barely hits actually theres two hits on him five  points two ones in a row for damage are you serious okay  marisha goddamn it jarett  laura its okay im happy that hes here  liam happens to everybody  matt and then he is going to try and move back this way to keep everyone scattered and use the  space to his advantage thats going to end jaretts turn  taliesin is there a little /none/ hole in the ground where the magma came out or no  matt no it burst and then it cooled and covered the space all righty that brings us to gilmores  turn gilmore whos in a bad place is going to go ahead and take his superior healing potion  taliesin gets max healing because he was in the spell  matt thats true yeah so he takes 16 20 24 plus eight is 32 nice  marisha thats awesome good spell  liam thanks pike

a hold monster from where he is right there thats a wisdom saving throw  for thordak yeah that succeeds thats a nine plus but he tried  sam and looked good doing it  laura thats right those robes are fabulous gilmore  matt thank you he goes darting behind the other building off the opposite side yeah that  actually doesnt help in this circumstance that ends his /none/ turn grog  travis yes  matt

gathering at the corner of your mouth you swing with the axe and carves a  small line but doesnt actually penetrate the armor of thordak  travis scottish accent great thats better that is a 26  matt that hits  travis good  taliesin you beat the scottish into him  travis 27 minus five is 22  matt 22 misses  taliesin good to know were learning 22 misses  matt roll damage /none/ on that strike  travis i got to get rid of that fucking great weapon master that things killing me  laura oh yeah  liam his ac is high so ditch the handicap  travis hey thats a six six points of necrotic for a total of 36 points of damage  matt 36 points of damage nice so as two blows are deflected from the armor one does sink in  pretty hard carving a piece of dragon flesh thats dangling off now in the torso

natural 20  sam on the last one im going to cutting words  travis theres three theres one more  sam then on the last one  matt okay natural 20 laughs  sam well then maybe that wont help  /none/ travis singing happy trails to shit  matt okay so a bite two claw attacks and a tail attack against you as its tail swings down  and whips towards you so first the bite attack you suffer 16 plus a 12 28 points of piercing  damage reduced to 14 as well as  marisha come on this is what youre built for this is why we trained you  matt 19 points of fire damage reduced that to nine  travis cool  matt so

and see keyleth on the ground how are you doing keyleth  marisha im okay im on the ground but im not super /none/ low im still full on hit points well  matt yeah shes going to go full double move on this one she wants to get into the fray and is so  frustrated that shes too far out of the way kima is going to go ahead and rush out and do a 2d6  heal to gilmore again so thats seven to gilmore  sam no well he gets full healing  matt oh thats right 2d6 so its a full 12  taliesin thats so clutch we should do that every time from now on  matt kima /none/ is now taking a full 50 foot move 50 okay shes charging in weve done this before  and we can do it again as she has her holy avenger arcing over her shoulder running  screaming yells vax what are you doing  liam bonus action im taking the potion of invulnerability  sam oh shit  travis time to get crunk  liam next action i cast hunters mark on thordak  laura yeah  matt okay  sam you can do that  liam then i fly at thordaks face and strike at him with the dragonslayer /none/ sword  cheering  liam face face  matt right so youre up in the air now  liam at advantage good 26 hits  matt yes it does  liam so this is dragonslayer sword

do that  liam thats done so i dont know exactly how far it was to his face and i know im all out of moves  and im open to getting bitten again but i want to fly away from his face as far as i can and land  opposite everybody maybe near the lip no behind the building behind him  matt im currently working out how much movement youve /none/ done because youre crazy  liam 120 feet of movement  matt its about 65 to get up to his face  laura oh sweet  matt all right and youre going to pull back from him  liam curve over his oh no swords in his head my friends are going to fucking kill you  today you fuck arc over his head  matt the blade which has jammed itself right in the cheekbone under the eye of the dragon as you  draw it out theres a streak of dragon blood roar unhinged laughter you arc over /none/ as you  do he reaches up with his face his jaws snarl reach out to try and bite you that is a 21 to hit  liam no  matt the jaws snap in the air just as you coast through with your wings  liam ill slam down if i can behind the building behind his big fat ass  matt sure  laura i whisper on the earring that was my brother that was my brother  matt you are going to have an attack of opportunity from oh no you disengaged from the  liam i /none/ didnt disengage  matt oh sorry so the fire elemental actually would have gotten an attack of opportunity on you  as you ran past  laura before all that he knocks you unconscious  matt thats a 20 yeah misses  taliesin vax it might be worth taking a peek in that crater when you get a second  liam working on it working on it  matt all righty that ends your turn kimas turn pikes up however at the end of vaxs  turn thordak is going to go ahead and use a tail attack against grog /none/  marisha did he ever make that save by the way  sam not yet  matt disadvantage which is good because it was a natural 20 and a six plus 16 22 makes it  laura 22 hes got to roll under a four or lower to get  sam theres no way its not going to happen  laura its possible its possible  marisha it keeps going it still goes  matt it keeps going it lasts for seven days  marisha yeah its a sevenday thing  travis after were all dead hell get very sick /none/  taliesin if we die today hes going to get the flu later in his life  travis lets reason with him you can die now wait for later  liam that doesnt look normal  travis why does it burn when i pee  matt however it lasts for seven days but remember thats if the spell succeeds if he  succeeds three saving throws it goes away  marisha if he succeeds three  matt yeah  marisha i thought he just had to fail  matt fail three to take effect succeed three to just get rid /none/ of the disease  liam just dish out damage  laura these damn spells  taliesin he has disadvantage  matt so anyway that brings us to pike oh he was doing the tail attack to you so using one of  the legendary actions to make a tail strike against  liam so legendaries can fall whenever they want  matt at the end of someone elses turn  travis this is against me  matt yeah because youre right there with advantage that would be 31 so yeah that hits you  taliesin i pray for a singledigit /none/ number  travis almost double my ac  matt 20 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to ten  taliesin man you are a tank  travis not much longer  taliesin were working on it  matt all righty so pike whats pike doing  laura okay pike is going to run forward  liam oh grog  laura oh grog and she runs as far forward as she can  matt thats as far as she can get  laura were trying to get a little diagonal she wants to be 60 feet away from him  matt hes /none/ within 60 feet  laura okay can she be at a diagonal so shes not lined up with keyleth and bigby  matt i mean thats as far as she can get  laura okay then she casts heal on grog which gives him 70 hit points automatically healed  travis thats amazing  matt yeah so youre up 70 hit points grog  laura and thats a 6thlevel spell so shes going to cast spiritual weapon as a 5thlevel  spell as her bonus action  matt she cant because she already cast a 6thlevel spell if you do /none/ a spell thats higher  than 2ndlevel you can only do a 2ndlevel spell as your bonus action  laura oh thats how it works i thought it just had to be lower than  matt technically rules as written you cant do that but as weve been playing for the sake of  having so many players i allow bonus action spells as long as theyre level two or lower  laura should we just do it  taliesin no no  laura if she does it at a 2ndlevel then  liam and itll keep going  laura /none/ yeah  taliesin but what happens if you do it at a higher level  marisha more damage  laura well yeah but shes always going to be at a higher level than 2ndlevel spells so it  doesnt matter  taliesin well i mean like next round though if she does that at a 5thlevel just the damage  itll add will be more than double the damage itll do now  liam i say wait because shes doing her job shes keeping grog alive  marisha so you might want to do that at a lower spell level /none/ and keep the higher levels for  healing  laura okay okay okay wait okay she can also do mass healing word as a bonus action at never  mind thats a 3rdlevel spell so fuck it  matt yeah sorry  laura she can do healing word though at second level  matt she can  laura should we do that who needs healing  sam i mean everybody  laura shes going to do healing word on grog again  liam at max  matt okay so at second level that means thats 2d4 plus five so 13 /none/ you heal 13 hit points  travis nice  taliesin which is like another attack you absorb thats great its like one more attack to  absorb  matt all right that ends pikes turn then scanlan youre up  sam im up  matt yes  sam for my attack i will punch the fire elemental currently menacing kiki with my fist of  fury  matt all righty go ahead and roll a spell attack  sam okay 24  matt that hits  liam it would have hit the fucking dragon  matt it wouldve so 8d8 /none/ points of damage to the fire elemental  sam 8d8 i need all the d8s  travis all the d8s  marisha here ive got d8s how many do you need  laura hey scanlan mimes playing a flute  taliesin thats seven  sam four i need one more thats a d12 laughs oh man these are all good though  taliesin so you want one more though  sam i do oh my god okay 16 17 18 19 20 30 41  matt 41 points of damage nice it slams into his form and you watch as /none/ his body kind of tears open  for a second the flames dissipating and then form back in but theyre starting to flicker  sam hes not dead  matt no  sam as my bonus action ill punch him again  matt no bonus  sam that was my action as a bonus action i can do something else with bigby no  matt let me double check  sam every subsequent action i can do something as a bonus action does that also negate the action  matt when you cast a spell as a bonus action it /none/ says here you can move the hand and cause the  effects its your bonus action to move the spell so your action is there ill say it says  specifically bonus action  sam so i cant do it as my action  laura so you can do something else  sam so that was my bonus action then  matt correct to do that is your bonus  sam so i can do something else then  matt ill let you do it again if you want to  sam no no no ill do something else oh /none/ by the way i cant use my movement to drink a  potion right  matt no  sam okay laughs  travis laughing id like to drink a potion  sam can i lean over the wall there and ill lightning bolt the same guy  matt okay so it would be over the edge of that wall there and blasting noise all right go for  it so thats a no that is a 12 for its dexterity saving throw so it takes full damage  sam all right so  taliesin and sam oh  sam four /none/ ones in a row so far so  laughter  sam so i made up for some of them 15  matt 15 points of lightning damage against the fire elemental okay the bolt hits it and the  fire elemental goes sizzling not terribly damaged by the impact  travis at least it didnt point and laugh at you  matt okay do you want to stay where you are  sam yeah absolutely  matt okay that ends scanlans turn up to the top percival  travis he used your full first name  taliesin yeah okay thats /none/ fine  marisha its like when youre in trouble  taliesin i am in trouble i have a whole bunch of your d8s over here by the way feel free to pull  them out whenever you like im going to try a couple things im going to do a piercing shot on  the fire elemental which i think i can do im going to start moving in a northerly direction so  i guess ill take like one or two steps southwest i suppose it would be to you yeah there you go  matt there  taliesin /none/ yeah thatll do it and im going to do a piercing shot that burns a grit okay thatll  do thats 25 to hit the elemental  matt 25 hits  taliesin and now i have to roll again for thordak  matt well you have to decide whether your if its a piercing shot affecting also kima or grog  because its a straight line and it hits depending on how you angle it youre either  hitting kima or youre hitting grog  sam oh shit  taliesin really  matt yep  travis im saying kimas not /none/ actually attached to a human being just saying  taliesin kimas not short enough that itll go right over her head  matt nope as per the rules as designed no  travis i totally love kima i got nothing against her just looking out for myself right now  matt shes parkouring off of the damaged wall trying to get into the fray with the dragon and  happens to catch where the bullet would be going  taliesin okay thats happening apparently  marisha are you shooting kima  taliesin its either kima or grog although grog takes /none/ half damage  matt this is true  travis yeah okay come on  taliesin you take half damage  travis all right ill remember this later  matt so grog it is roll for attack against grog  laura i know his head is so high how are you hitting grog  travis its in the rules  taliesin its in the rules  matt in theory from this angle in to hit the fire elemental and thordak he has to aim up  taliesin 20  matt 20 against grog hits  travis yeah it hits  matt /none/ and roll against thordak  taliesin and no i cant have a misfire once ive already hit the first  matt correct only the additional attack can misfire  taliesin okay thats 15 that doesnt hit  sam so you only hit grog  taliesin i only hit grog no i also hit the fire elemental  matt roll damage once  taliesin yeah i hit the fire elemental though  marisha maybe youll kill it  taliesin maybe i will maybe its maybelline where are my d12s they seem to have all  vanished  marisha kill it oh /none/ jeez come on man  taliesin thats awful 13 points of damage  matt okay grog you take 13 points of piercing damage halved to six round it down six  taliesin sorry and the bullet gets lodged in you  matt yeah basically  liam its there for 50 years  taliesin sorry and then is the fire elemental still standing  matt yes it is  taliesin im irritated im burning another grit and im going to do a pushback on the elemental  thats actually no save thats just a pushback i just have to hit and /none/ that hits i should have  done a thats a 29 32 to hit  matt 32 to hit thatll hit go ahead and roll damage and it just gets pushed back ten feet  taliesin no im saving you  marisha i mean i could have handled it  taliesin 14 i want you to be able to get up without that thing on you 20 points of damage  and it gets pushed back ten feet thank you  matt its form gets knocked back coalesces again as a flickering flame creature its looking hurt  its barely /none/ keeping its form together at this point its still standing  taliesin im going to use my bonus action for a healing surge to add 22 points to my hit points  then im going to keep running use spider to run over that wall into that little house beneath the  green dragon  matt all right  liam spiderclimb is cool  sam little house on the prairie with the dragon on it  taliesin there we go  matt all right that finishes your turn percy now you watch as the skyship deera pushes through  some /none/ of the clouds and you can now see a series of small shapes as it looks like a halfdozen  wyverns are currently harrying it from the sky attacking it you can see some sort of combat  going on on the bow of the ship but you also watch as two of its arballists are set up and  fire towards thordak that actually hits thats cocked and yeah a 16 and a 15 with bonus it  hits both  laura thats captain damon right to the rescue  matt so theyre both superheated they are flaming arballists /none/ fire doesnt have an effect  but they still do piercing damage for a total of 22 points of piercing damage you watch these two  large thick heavy metallic piercing bolts come arcing through slamming into thordaks hide the  flames flicker on the edge where it impacted though it has little effect and thordak is  insane growling  travis crazy motherfucker  laura hes so fucking crazy  matt insane growling maniacal laughter  sam oh god  matt two of the wyverns apparently noticing the fray and peel off beginning to make their way  down /none/ to where this struggle is happening  sam no problem whispered big problem  liam this is a busy battlefield  matt at this point in time im going to do  taliesin youre having way too much fun  matt yeah okay  sam matt has been waiting a year for this  liam dont worry sir we didnt see you playing with your dolls  matt laughs grog and kima suddenly the ground quakes beneath you and it splits open and a very  thick yellowishgreen sulfurous gas just spills out in the vicinity immediately filling your  /none/ lungs and causing your chest to seize just from breathing the air in i need both you and her to  make a the area is now heavily obscured so now there is a heavy smoke all in this area right now  laura does his head peek up above that  matt yes it does  laura hes so tall  matt you dont do anything yet  travis nothing yet  matt you dont do anything yet  travis on my turn  matt on your turn youll do it  sam does that affect the fire elemental /none/ too  matt it may  laura you dont know  sam i dont sam five has his theories though  matt for raishans turn as smoke has filled the area coughing youre having a hard time  raishan sees this picks up off the ground as the wyvern begins to strike first im going to see if  her breath comes back it does not seeing the new creatures in the fray is going to rush up and  interfere with this one immediately and just do a full round of attacks against the wyvern  travis singing eat /none/ the little pterodactyl  matt thatll hit thatll hit thatll hit bite and two claws yep that wyvern is looking really  hurt as you watch as raishan reaches up and just tears into its side and claws into its belly  theyre both wrestling in the air almost in a momentary freefall then catch themselves again  raishan just clings on the wyvern is already in a really really bad place  sam oh thats great  matt that ends raishans turn at the end of raishans turn thordak is going to do another  wing attack  liam /none/ man groggy 17 displacer beasts just appear  laura like why would he add wyverns for his own sake  matt hes going to do another wing attack at the cost of two of its actions picking up the wind  around it once more i need grog kimas just out of the range thankfully grog i need you to  make a dexterity saving throw  travis i have advantage because of  matt you do  laura would the wings disperse the gas on the ground  matt nope but it does push it  laura damn it /none/  marisha oh boy  travis 17  matt 17 nope you take  laura oh no  matt 16 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to eight  travis okay  matt and you take eight points of fire damage reduced to four from the impact and you are  knocked prone so you are now prone on the ground and this gets pushed eversoslightly this way  travis off of me  matt off of you onto keyleth pike kima currently the dragon does shift  taliesin oh no grogs down so theres no attack of opportunity  matt /none/ keyleth youre up initially i need you to make a constitution saving throw  marisha yeah all right not that one not that one gil dont fuck me gil all right thats  not too bad 19  matt 19 you succeed you manage to just hold your breath and the poison doesnt makes its way  and fit into your lungs  marisha so i still have this asshole in front of me right  matt yes you do  marisha but hes been pushed back  matt its pushed back yeah so its not in contact with you /none/  taliesin yeah you

half of 35 all right as the blight spell takes hold you watch as the tendrils of black  necrotic energy begin to carve between the scales of thordaks body you watch as portions of the /none/  scar in the chest split almost like a fresh wound a little bit of pus begins to pour forth  its nasty  marisha i take a few steps back can i tuck into that little broken building a little bit just  inside the doorway  matt sure you are just inside the doorway right now with percy  marisha perfect  matt actually you cant quite get that far because you were knocked prone so youre just  barely no you can just get in there so youre good  marisha how are you doing  taliesin /none/ i am just i am regretting so many things right now  marisha i dont know how we got here  taliesin neither do i i should have

right how many feet am i from the elemental  matt he is 15 feet from you ten feet  sam you could have cast it on the  marisha no im not going to blow a 4thlevel spell on his ass im going to do a

there youre fine as /none/ you get up off the ground the smoke you  slam your staff into the ground the smoke around you dissipates momentarily as the shockwave hits  the fire elemental it just turns into ash and vanishes  marisha got rid of that fucking asshole all right and thats all i can do  matt you have 15 feet you can move  marisha okay now ill tuck into there  matt now you can tuck in yeah since you did move that time there you go  travis marisha there you go  matt at the end of keyleths /none/ turn raishans going to use a legendary action to make another  attack against the wyvern that will hit and that will do it with that the wyvern gets its head  ripped off by raishan the body plummets the lizardman that was riding it ends up falling off  slams into the ground  travis wilhelm scream  marisha taliesin halfhearted wilhelm scream  taliesin ive got shit to do in the morning im not going to do it for real  travis all right fair enough  matt nine points of bludgeoning damage as it hits the ground /none/ its still alive but its  looking up at this green dragon that ends keyleths turn jarett is currently afraid as shit  travis laughs because he rolled not very good  matt hes going to reload and look over he has to roll with disadvantage against thordak from  that distance cant get closer even with disadvantage hits on the first attack with 16  and 18 misses with the second one  travis crossbow  matt yeah with the crossbow still manages to do 13 points of piercing damage to thordak which is  nice jarett is then /none/ going to finish moving out of visual sight of this like nope nope nope  behind the wall panting this is uh this is a terrible idea theyre not paying me enough for this  taliesin hes not going to take a shot at the elemental while hes running away  matt no he was focused on thordak he was just like yells that ends jaretts turn gilmores  turn gilmore is dodging out of the outside of the cloud and goes all right lets see if we can  try this again hes going to go ahead and move /none/ up into the building just outside of the radius  travis come on buddy  matt looking behind where the window is busted open hes going to blow his one 7thlevel spell  as a lowerlevel spell of disintegrate once more up towards the chest where its kind of cracked  open that is a 24 13 plus 11 that hits  travis boom nobody else is excited about this  laura i am

fan og  matt so it deals 88 points of damage to thordak  cheering  matt you watch as the beam slams right into the side of thordaks shoulder and torso area the  beam firing out from behind the /none/ broken wall the wings extend as hes bearing down on vax and as  it hits the flesh kind of peels away and turns to dust in the vicinity pained roar you can see  hes just reeling from the pain the mouth opens wide the eyes go wide as it begins to curl  across as it does you see it theres a bit of bone exposed there where the flesh once was you  can see scar removed and pulled back you can see on the inside of the ribcage just barely exposed  the outside of a /none/ glistening red crystal that is embedded in thordaks chest  sam he does have it  laura it was just covered  travis the skins grown over it  laura and its being absorbed so im not going to get it  matt that is the end of gilmores turn that brings us to grog and thordak  travis would you like to go first  matt first let me see this roll is going to yes i would like to go first  laura sam oh no  laura he just got his fire breath back  matt after /none/ getting disintegrated thordak who was focused on you his attention keeps shifting  from place to place hes not focused in his current mental state enraged roar and you watch  as he heaves you see the flames flickering brighter and brighter across him fwoosh  sam oh god no

it blows out the rocks from this side of the wall and the wall the wall here actually  gets knocked open to that side as the tidal wave pushes out keyleth do you want to move or stay  where you are  marisha ill pop myself out of the door a little bit  matt okay  sam whats that other thing that youve been doing to him that he has to save on every once in  a while  laura /none/ oh contagion

you should sorry thank you  sam i rolled a what do i add to it  matt its a constitution saving throw so you add your constitution save /none/  sam constitution so 18  matt with that bigbys hand fades the spell knocked asunder thank you for reminding me of  that so that comes to end that turn  marisha he has to roll a save  matt yes he does and that is a seven plus 16  marisha does he still have disadvantage on these  matt no he doesnt have disadvantage on every save just the one he was cutting wordsd youre right  marisha yeah he has to roll under a five  matt same thing so with that the third save is /none/ made contagion  sam at least it wont eat up my cutting words any more  marisha its resting in peace with my 8thlevel spell and her dragonslaying arrow theyre in a  puddle somewhere  matt its a rough couple rounds  laura did i see where that dragonslaying arrow sailed off to  matt with the sheer amount of clouds of ash and blackness in the air you have no idea where it  went im afraid at the end of thordaks turn the wyvern that had seen you it did spot you  your stealth was not /none/ very good it leaps down into the back of the building and growls coming  towards you the wyverns going to make a multiattack the first is a bite attack against  you thats a natural one does not hit you the stinger however is a natural 20 wow so that is  for 12 points of piercing damage to you and i need you to make a constitution saving throw  liam and taliesin poison immunity  matt thats right so no effect  laura 12 points of damage  matt the rider is going to swing at you /none/ with a heavy club and then a javelin that is a 16  whats your ac  laura 21  matt nope and no misses you with both youre just too quick for him the giant sees percy lying  on the ground and goes yells with its giant twohanded sword its going to make two attacks  against percy with advantage 19 so thats 30 for the first one  taliesin oh that just hits  matt and a 22 with the second  taliesin that also just hits  matt all right so you take 28 points of /none/ slashing damage from each hit  taliesin so thats 28 times two  laura 56  taliesin 56 all right thats fine i blame you for all of this  sam were getting in flute range soon  taliesin ill be hearing about it from the kitchen itll be great ill be working on my new  character  matt all right that brings us to  sam raishan  matt no

sam worth it  matt /none/ you release the first arrow which goes and strikes thordak in the upper shoulder wing area  growls he turns around and goes to face you the arms and wings open angrily as you release the  dragonslaying arrow it goes and hits the side where the chest is currently disintegrated and  exposed as the arrow using the power of fenthras behind it slams into the crystal the crystal  shatters as it breaks you watch as thordak goes crazed laughter and the form begins to slowly shrink  travis oh shit  matt growling he seems to be /none/ grinning and laughing through the pain as the swollen  primordial dragon form of thordak begins to slowly wither and wither  sam you have another model  laura what  sam and its even bigger  laura look at the puny little fuck  sam hes a little puny baby  matt thats still a pretty fucking huge dragon  laughter  sam hes so sad  matt now there are hanging folds of dragon hide skin the form shrunk but portions still are  sagging off of it  laura can i duck around the side so im /none/ in the building so im not in the opening yeah  marisha are we going to try and take raishan out as well  matt at the end of your turn hes going to use two legendary actions to wing attack trying to  whip the wings much faster now due to the somewhat dire circumstances i need pike and currently  just pike to make a dexterity saving throw  sam come on pike for all the marbles  laura 17  matt nope pike takes 20 points of bludgeoning damage and eight points of fire damage reduced to /none/ four  laura so shes got ten points left  sam shes a perfect ten always was  matt hes going to fly up  sam does pike get an attack of opportunity  travis i do  laura and pike does  matt there we go you both do  travis has his ac changed with his different size you dont know reckless great weapon  master natural 20  matt really  travis yeah on the first roll  laura and pike rolled a 32  sam jesus what is she attacking with  laura her mace of /none/ disruption  sam yes she is  matt so go ahead and roll damage for both of them  travis i also have brutal critical which at thirteenth level you roll two additional damage dice  matt yes you do  taliesin which you then double dont you  matt no you add those two so roll the damage first and then double the dice  laura and then she gets divine strike right on her attack  matt correct  travis 28 so i double that  matt you double the dice including the d4 and d6 from your /none/ weapon and your enlarged status  travis right so thats 16 doubled 32 so then thats an 11 so 47  matt nice and pikes  laura pike rolled fuck 18 19 it was 19  matt okay perfect you both strike as the nowdiminished form of thordak begins to pull  backward eyes looking around the piercing starlike white light of the eyes seems to have  slowly recoiled into a glowing reddishorange and you can now see where the crystal once was in the  chest there is just a gaping hole where bits of flesh and dragon /none/ muscle

die that hes got too sparkly  marisha shes getting ideas  travis counting 34 37 38 38 points of damage  matt 38 points of damage  taliesin that with your bonus i just said that randomly i dont actually know any of your  bonuses i just thought maybe it would jog something  travis with my movement can i /none/ run nuts towards where the fire giant is  matt sure you can get right there  travis thatll work i need a new plaything thatll actually stay  matt thordak who is physically falling apart at this point sections just sloughing off and just  the whole experience has been sending his physical his whole physical form is wrecked  right now the word escapes me that i was looking for hes going to go ahead and turn and go into a  full flight  liam im riding him  matt youre riding him  liam yeah shit /dung/ yeah im riding him  marisha oh no no vax no  taliesin vax is good  laura no  matt dash into the dark hole within  taliesin this is good  laura why is this good  sam a dark hole  laura vax be careful  travis we dont care about the tunnel huh  laughter  matt you need to go ahead and roll a strength saving throw to try and maintain grip as the  dragon goes into a full dive  liam ill use my last luck so its a 15  matt 15 /none/ you do manage to make it inside the tunnel but you lose your grip and then go into a  full tumble hitting the ground its a decline its a 45degree angle downward  liam so im in there with him  matt yes roll an acrobatics check to stop yourself  liam that is a 25  matt 25 okay so you do tumble and come to a stop you dont take any damage from the fall and  you stop yourself from doing a tumble but it is still a decline into darkness below and you just  /none/ watch as the back end of thordaks barely flying form slams into the side of the tunnel and  continues swooping away  liam do i still see him with darkvision at this point  matt he just begins to leave outside of your darkvision  liam are we still in the same chain of initiative  matt as of right now we are yes so finishing that is thordaks go vex youre up  laura okay i run after him and dive after him because i saw that and at the edge of my  movement i want to /none/ hop out on my broom and get ready to fly down the hole after  matt okay so you are hasted so you get down and you basically have just enough movement to catch  up to your brother and you get the broom out youre both down there in the darkness by  yourselves you guys watch as the rest of them dive into the hole vax youre up  liam how far away from me is he  matt how far does your darkvision go for  liam 60 feet  matt hes outside of your darkvision  /none/ liam then i am going to use my movement and go 120 feet or until i see him  laura can i cast cause i didnt do an attack right  matt this is happening after your turn so you begin to dart forward  liam this is just my movement 120 feet or until im on him  matt well your movement is not 120 feet youre still flying through there  liam yes im flying  matt right so your wings are still out there okay okay so yeah you begin to come in you see  him /none/ just begin to come into your visual range  liam still away from me  matt still away from you  liam then im going to use a bonus action to dash and hit his back and land on his back  matt okay you land on his back  liam attack attack first attack is a scheisse 24  matt i would say you have disadvantage on these strikes as youre currently gripping onto a  flying dragon underneath a cavern ripping through you have advantage on them automatically which  means you dont have disadvantage on these strikes /none/ but you do not get the automatic sneak  attack  liam i dont remember oh i dont get the automatic sneak attack  matt no  liam but i got advantage  matt no essentially you would have advantage and then trying to grip onto him and through the  middle of this tunnel and slamming into him you would have disadvantage and so they both cancel  to just a regular attack  liam all right so 24 for the first  matt what was the first one  liam 24  matt 24 hits  liam second /none/ one is a natural 20  matt second one was a natural 20 all right  liam so the first ones the dragonslaying three eight 14 19 plus hunters mark so  theres no sneak attack on this right you said  matt correct  liam 21 with the dragonslayer  matt 21 nice  liam and then whisper which is a natural 20 is one plus that is nine plus the six is 15 plus  hunters mark 17  laura times two  liam oh 15 times two is 30  laura its all times two cause thats /dung/ all well 15 times two is 30  liam 30 plus eight 38  matt okay  how do you want to do this  yelling  laura in the dark alone  sam in a dark pit  liam with whisper im going to shove it in so that my hand disappears from view so im up to my  forearm and stab as far in as i can reach  i hear the voice of my mother in the morning fuck you  matt as the blade plunges into thordaks nowsloughing and soft flesh exposed through a  /none/ series of wounds and gashes left behind by your allies and his form just slowly shriveling into  its diminutive space the dagger cuts cleanly through and with that force you go all the way up  to the shoulder as you reach inside as you finish saying your phrase your eyes narrow and you  clench your teeth and as you pull back and yank theres this strange series of low whispers that  come into your ears and as you pull back you watch as these bits of greyish energy begin to  pour out of the air /none/ coalescing around the blade fitting into the body where youre currently  plunged within as you yank outward you watch as the blade almost has an extended edge about ten  15 feet beyond whispers actual and this blade edge just leaves a giant wound on the side of  thordaks body you dont even hear an exclamation of pain as thordak just slowly slams into the  ground of this low barely glowing tunnel roll an acrobatics check with disadvantage  liam 25  matt 25  sam jesus  matt so with the speed and impact of tumbling /none/ you manage to reduce the damage by half so you  liam which is also halved by the potion  matt right that is 17 points of bludgeoning damage  liam is that the quarter  matt no thats halved so that would bring it to 8 as you watch thordaks form sputter roll and  then tumble grinding to a halt gathering a bunch of stone broken rock and part of the cavern  thats on the verge of collapsing from the impact of thordaks body now lifeless still in the  darkness subterranean tunnel  and were going /none/ to take a break  yelling  travis we dont even know its happened though yet its all underground  taliesin she would know  laura i do know can i fly forward before we take the break  matt you want to  laura i just want to fly forward and hug my brother as hes just covered in dragon guts  taliesin hes way down in there thats a long flight  matt and now well take a break so well be back here in a few minutes  sam dont forget backblaze is hosting a critical role

rest of you /none/ watch as  thordak swooped into the hole that he emerged from quickly followed by vex and vax there is  still on the field raishan just tore into this lizard man we have a fire giant that is unscathed  currently bearing down on the rest of the party and a wyvern rider back around this wall section  here that being the case they end that turn there first up is lady kima who is pissed that  she hasnt had a chance to really do anything tonight against flying dragons  travis theres a big fire giant /none/  matt thats what shes going to do  paladins that dont fly and have haste have a hard time getting around just so you know  laura vestige  matt watching this giant whale upon percy pisses her off and she cracks her neck youre first  and she leaps down  travis open him up  matt and shes going to multiattack against him that is that hits and the other also hits even  with a minus five on each for her great weapon master shes also going to divine smite on that  at a level /none/ three  travis yeah get it  matt first strike is a 14 plus ten 24 plus 11 35 42 points of damage on her first strike  against the giant  travis boom  matt and the second strike is 24 points of damage so that fire giants already had a big  chunk taken out of its kima rushes up and double strikes with her holy avenger one cleaving off a  piece of its armor the second one cuts through leaving a giant flash of divine energy as it  bursts out the side she looks up /none/ in the eyes and says bahamut says hi that ends kimas turn  pike is up now  sam oh hows pike doing  laura pike oh pikes turn jesus  liam shes doing great  travis head out of ass  laura im sorry okay  liam shes in manhattan  laura she stands up  matt technically i was going to say the giant was going on thordaks turn

both kima  and grog  travis thats such a mistake  matt and is going to take a strike on each takes an attack on kima and rolls thats a 20 that  hits and then roll grog that is a 29  travis that hits  matt thats 28 points of damage to kima and its fun to roll against the players 33 points of  slashing damage against you grog  travis so halved to math  matt 16  travis thank you i will use my /none/ retaliation the old chin turned back reckless great weapon  master thats better 21  matt 21 that hits  travis nice 21 that was crap and 22 both ones 22 plus ten is 32  matt 32 points of damage nice the giant already in that round of attacks and your retaliation is  it has its giant greatsword on the ground its rearing up for its next round of arcing attacks  that brings us to pike whats pike

roll a melee spell attack  laura okay okay okay thats 18  matt 18 just hits  laura okay oh wait 17  matt nope  liam 17 sounds like 18  matt it does but its not the same the giant sees the flash of light as the bolt comes towards  it out the corner of its eye as it has its blade down it instead ducks underneath using grog for  cover briefly /none/ as it arcs past its shoulder and shoots off through the cloud out of sight  marisha what if it was 1799 thats basically like 18  matt its not  liam crazy eddie prices  travis taco bell logic right there  laura she says so sorry i guess you do have all the fun how are you on hit points grog you okay  travis yep  laura okay then shes going to healing word herself at first level  matt okay d4 plus five  laura okay thats six points  matt there

that was a lot its either 33 or 34 they fucked me up but it was a lot it was  mostly sevens and /none/ eights  matt well go with 34 on that cool so as the giant ducks out of the way of the guiding bolt  streaking past it snickers and grins says something in giant which you hear which is  travis gasps  matt you didnt even hear what he said yet  travis oh i will hold my reaction  matt insolents bow to your king  travis no  matt and then as it brings the sword up while it saw the glimmer of the guiding bolt it didnt  see the purple glimmer of the shining fist /none/ as it comes up and whack right across the jaw  dislocating it briefly as the fist comes back up and is ready for another round still standing  but looking pretty rough that brings us to  sam that was my bonus action as my action i will swig a greater healing potion  matt okay  sam what is that four  matt greater healing potion is 4d4 plus four yeah  taliesin oh 4d4 plus six  sam yeah the potion doesnt do that for me does it plus four four three two one is ten right /none/  matt yes so 14 hit points you heal  laura when you were healing pike with the superior did you add  sam youre right its two less than i

marisha he needs horse blinders horse blinders  taliesin so 27 points of damage plus one im so sorry  sam what goes around comes around  matt so as the fist clocks him across the face dislocating the jaw it stands up and grabs the  jaw and snaps /none/ it back into place looks up just in time for you to come up out of the shadow and  gunshots turning the barrels you fire and the first shot hits in the side of the throat and  blows open the neck and you see as the blood begins to gout out reaches up with a hand and it  gasps but its to no use as the other shot takes out the right eye blowing out the back of the  giants head as it falls backward  sam violence violence who wouldve thought a fire giant would /none/ be so easy  taliesin i am now going to start making my way to the im going to start running my way to the  pit with what little movement i have because i got up  matt okay all right that ends percys turn top of the round the lair actions do not function  however you watch as the skyship deera still rotating around theres still wyverns attacking  you hear the distant sounds of lightning cracks as well and you hear very very distantly what  sounds like a sorry internet a cacophony of voices because /none/ theres no other word to describe  it hundreds and hundreds of voices all shouting combat war cries simultaneously you have no idea  how far away it is its very very faint you just pick it up you hear the sound of impacts of  crumbling stone in the distance there is a battle happening all throughout the city that is slowly  making its way towards your current location deeras turned around and is going to take two  shots at raishan because its going to fire at whatever dragons are there damon was not notified  of /none/ anything otherwise  laura you know what if raishan gets hit she gets hit  matt rolled an eight and an eight no it does not hit oh she gets three attacks because the  travis what  matt three eights in a row thats ridiculous yeah thats

taliesin ill respond to the pit now  matt /none/ which raishan at this point is now leaping whoosh and disappears into the portal or down  into the hole in the ground  taliesin she was already going that way she doesnt get into shit with that  laura i want her to get hit  taliesin shes not going to get shes going in the tunnel  matt all right at this point full speed that is 60 feet yeah you guys as youre having  this moment hugging each other  laura hugs  matt you hear wings flapping smash the ground shakes nearby as you turn /none/ and see you watch as  raishan skids to a halt right next to you and the currently smashed corpse of thordak within the  tunnel  marisha can i say over like a headpiece thing be like twins if youre still alive i think  raishans coming in your direction  liam thanks for that  matt raishan is watching both of you as she begins to walk towards thordaks corpse and goes  youve done well  liam yeah what now  taliesin every six seconds we get to move  marisha yeah were heading ass hauling ass /none/ that way  taliesin booking with my spider walk  laura im heading asswherever  taliesin running down the ceiling upsidedown  travis not me im putting out that last fire on the map  laura stomp stomp stomp  sam hes volunteer fire department yeah  matt 80 foot flying this wyvern swoops in  sam ah theres a fucking wyvern  liam keyleth  matt the one that was left earlier that was after you is going to swoop in and attempt to  make two strikes at kima miss and a three miss and the riders going /none/ to go ahead and make two  strikes at her as well miss with a 17 and a two kimas like deflecting getting against the wall  as the spear shoots by and as the blade comes down from the rider she strikes it with the sword and  stops it midair and she starts laughing in his face that ends its go  travis trinity  matt keyleth youre up  sam keyleth theres a wyvern on the field or you can ignore and go into the hole  marisha fuck that wyvern i say everyone in the hole /none/ and i head towards the hole  taliesin were going to need light down here  sam singing head to the hole  matt are you doing a double move  marisha singing black as your soul what  matt double move are you doing a dash action  sam youve got nothing else to do  marisha yeah ill dash  matt okay so you begin to make it into the hole that brings us to jaretts turn jarett is going  to turn the corner hes like so its gone okay good loads the crossbow sees the wyvern /none/  and goes are you no are you seriously and takes his shots nice 19 yeah two shots against  the wyvern  laura nice this is his level this is what jarett needs at a time  liam this is the jarett we know  matt 14 points of damage hes not the heroic individual you guys are necessarily  marisha look hes a great security guard  laura he is badass  matt he is in his own field  liam he caught my sisters attention anyone that does that has got to have a lot of spunk /none/  matt all righty so that ends his turn there those two shots both sink into the wyvern both  bolt stuns snarling that will end his go gilmore recognizing the circumstance here and  everyones rushing in there hes going to go ahead and okay hell go actually me first  and he dimension doors to the edge and begins to charge in after you guys that brings us to grog  travis i want to kill all the things that are alive  matt okay so you move into melee with the wyvern and the rider  travis /none/ yeah great weapon master reckless eight 15 19  matt hits  marisha kill it real hard  travis 16 22 ooh 26 36 for the first hit  matt well say for the sake of brevity youre going to wipe out the wyvern  travis yay  matt because youre giant grog  travis is the lizard man left  matt the lizard man is left yes  travis can i give him the option to run  matt if you want to  travis nah fuck that i kill him too  matt well all three of your /none/ attacks would be what it would take to take out the wyvern  travis hey oh cool  matt so as you finish cleaving the wyvern down it falls over and the lizard mans like snarls  travis yeah i do this  matt reptilian whimper it looks conflicted  travis youre at a crossroads bro crossroads  matt vex its your go  laura okay  matt you have raishan like booming footsteps stepping over to thordaks body watching you  closely  laura what are you doing  matt exactly what we talked about learning his secret  /none/ laura im going to keep my hand ready to attack and hold my action until anything gets aggressive  with raishan  matt okay  taliesin what do you see down there whats happening whats in the room  laura thordak is dead  taliesin whats in the room  laura oh what do i see around me  matt the tunnel that youre in its been a steady decline its rounded off a little bit and  it begins to open up maybe 70 feet ahead of you actually with your darkvision you would just  barely start to /none/ see it begin to open it looks like theres an actual chamber ahead of all of you  guys but you havent reached it yet  travis the shitter  laura okay im going to use my movement to back away from raishan towards the chamber but im  going to hold my attack until i think its aggressive  matt okay so as you move in you can see theres a very very faint glow of orange and red in the  room and the whole tunnel here has a very very very concentrated natural burning chemical smell  /none/ to it a lot of sulfurtype very putrid pungent smells and the glow you can now see there is a  lava flow that is coalescing in the center of this room or at least is pouring through and it looks  like its bisecting this room you dont make out much more detail than that at this distance but  you do see this chamber does have an actual flow of liquid rock  laura okay  matt vax  liam keyleth you tell me  marisha whats going on whatcha doing  liam you tell me  marisha /none/ just describe the scene  liam hit or wait  marisha wait till im there wait till im there  liam what  marisha wait till im there  liam im going to hold my turn until keyleth acts  matt okay pike scanlan you guys all follow suit  sam yeah  matt okay at a full run you guys can get at your tiny feet you can get up towards the edge  there  taliesin im at a full run on the roof  matt right percival yeah you do you get up there and inside raishan /none/ comes up to the body of  thordak and you see that she reaches up under one of her scales and pulls out a small leather case  travis oh shit  matt pops open the case  marisha dont let her touch him  matt and sits back and pulls open a somewhat weathered scroll and starts reading off of it  magical language  laura oh no what is this  marisha no no no dont go dont go  liam attack im attacking her she acted she said dont touch i said ill base it off of /none/  keyleth so im attacking im going to interrupt that  travis dont you want to see what happens  liam no  matt okay hold on you say attack based on because you dont see this yet  marisha i said dont let her touch him  travis shes reading that scroll man  matt she hasnt touched him yet but youre attacking on your own instinct  liam if ive heard dont let her touch him and shes doing that those two things mean the same  thing to me shes doing something yes  matt all right /none/ i will say for this go ahead and make a dexterity check  liam dexterity check all right and ill use my last luck of the day  sam i thought you did that already  liam i had two so thats a 28  matt 28 okay so you can make your attack this with the dagger  liam this is everything how far away is she from me  matt shes maybe like 20 feet so you can  liam all three attacks  matt well you held your action which means you can only take your action /none/ you cant move as well  liam okay move i dont need to move how far away is she you said  matt 20 feet  liam 20 feet so i can throw daggers at her right  laura yeah but you cant throw your sword  liam no but i have lots of daggers i still have the flametongue dagger which is not attuned its  just a lame old dagger  matt thats true you can do that yeah so yeah you can do that  taliesin oh boy  liam first one is a 23  matt /none/ a 23  liam second one is a 19  third one is a 29  matt okay so it was 29 hits the first one  liam god i dont remember  laura a 23  liam 23 sounds familiar  matt right the 19 was the one that didnt hit  liam so two of the three hit so it was hitmisshit right i think so all right so the  first one is whisper four plus eight is 12 plus psychic damage is 15 but theres no sneak attack  because theres nobody near her and the /none/ hunters mark oh can i move hunters mark to her at this  point i have no idea  matt no because youve used all your attacks  liam its a bonus okay got it okay so 15 for the first and the second one oh i dont need  that is nine  matt okay so what was the first attack it was  liam 15 plus nine  matt 15 15 plus nine so the first attack was 15 okay maintains concentration maintains  concentration  liam and ill use my movement to move between my sister and /none/ raishan  laura you cant do movement because you were holding your action  liam okay  matt okay so as both daggers come you watch as its muttering from the scroll not both of her  eyes but one of the eyes turns to face you  laura like a chameleon  matt yeah and narrows the scroll finishes and poof turns to ash and similar to something  youve seen before you watch as thordaks corpse which is currently buried into the rock with the  face to the side the breath filters into the mouth the body /none/ still motionless you recognize  this similar or adjacent magic to the speak with dead  liam weve seen pike do it  matt yes  sam shes just trying to ask a question vax i mean jesus  liam youre not here  matt so as soon as that finishes raishan the other eye flickers over now both eyes are on you  and says know what youre doing  liam youre not walking away from this field youre going to die maybe i will too but you are  going to die  matt chuckles okay  sam /none/ were men of our word were men of honor  matt raishan is going to  laura she did attack our home  sam im not saying shes great  matt hmm let me check one thing real fast  sam hmm oh boy you stumped the chump  matt well im trying to see what her reactions going to be oh okay she feels comfortable with  that she goes well then come claim me and just steps away from thordak and with one big  push of the wings turns around and coasts into the chamber beyond you /none/  liam out of sight  matt beyond you can see her form disappear into the darkness theres a little bit of an orange  glow in there but given that circumstance yeah she disappears into the shadows of the room  laura should i have taken my shots when things got aggressive  marisha so shes coming towards us  matt no shes going the opposite direction  laura i mean did that look aggressive  matt she flew away from your brother but your brother did throw three daggers into her and then  said she was going /none/ to die  travis did she ask her questions of thordak  laura it might not have been the same fucking spell it could have been something like it  travis he said it looked very similar  laura yeah adjacent  liam im sure she was just going to ask about cooking recipes its fine  matt so what are you going to do attack or not you watched your brother throw three daggers into  raishan and tell her that shes going to die and then raishan basically abandoned thordaks body  and fled  laura said come /none/ and claim me and flew toward me  matt flew over you and past into the chamber  laura yeah im going to attack  matt go for it roll your attacks  laura oh no  travis do it tiny toon  liam go for it  sam you got this bailes  marisha i mean she kind of released thordak shes totally little finger  laura this isnt about vengeance though you guys  sam what is it about  matt roll your attacks  liam five four three two  laura i dont know sad noise that /none/ one doesnt hit probably 18  matt nope  laura that one probably hits 27  matt yeah  laughter  sam saddest attack ever  laura and a natural fucking one fenthras can sense my trepidation  matt hah apparently so roll damage on one arrow strike and it is your hands shaking at this  moment youre trying to figure out what to do when she flies overhead you release one arrow pull  back and pull another and the second one is right as shes over and above sinks in and the third one  you fire /none/ after and it hits the rock ceiling  laura just 15 damage  matt 15 points of damage all righty raishan just swoops into the darkness of the chamber  beyond keyleth you just manage to catch up at this point now at a full run this will be your  full turn catching up to vex and vax or vax specifically vex is a little beyond aggressive  stance raishan nowhere to be seen thordaks corpse ground into the dirt  marisha where is she  liam forward  marisha are we going after her i mean  taliesin /none/ im not there  liam yes  marisha i run deeper into the hole  matt okay jarett and gilmore at this point manage to catch up to you guys as well itll  take a while for grog and kima to catch up to you guys  travis oh i didnt say i was leaving  sam looting the giants body  travis no theres a lizardfolk right there  matt its true actually yeah  travis i want to see how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie roll pop  sam one /none/ it takes one lick  matt well grog its staring at you going like growl  travis i reach out and go like head crushing sound  matt make a strength check  travis i have advantage on those  laughter  travis 18 18 plus seven 25  matt 25 theres this moment where youre grabbing its head and it reaches up and frantic snarl  travis cant hear you cant hear you  laughter  matt a very rikioh type moment the head just pops outward in a smear of purple gore  travis oh no thats the /none/ show folks all right well anybody see that whos here  sam my hand is near you  travis kimas there right  matt chuckles bigbys hand claps the wall applause  laughter  travis ha fuck bigbys hand  matt you look over at kima and kimas kind of spattered with it and she goes well done  travis smooth right lets join everybody else  matt all right all right youre going your movement about there full speed kimas a little  slower behind shell catch up at a full doubledash speed there jarett and everybody  else /none/ has kind of moved in well say at this point the rest of you  laura laughs jarett is just like  matt he cant do anything hes having a bad day man  marisha poor jarett  matt so you guys all charge in after  taliesin im doing the best i can i cant see a damn thing  matt no you guys are far behind so its currently you three in the lead  travis should anybody stay out here in case she wants to come back out you want me to stay out  matt do /none/ you want to move bigbys hand  sam yeah for the rest of the one minute  it works for which is not very long  matt nah  taliesin if she makes her way out that means were all dead come on in itll be fun lets  all die together  marisha well go to the spa afterwards  matt so you guys kind of rush into this chamber now and the heat in here is more immense than  anything you felt on the surface this is kind of the core of the volcanic surge that thordaks /none/  presence was pulling upward you see within theres this flow of lava i want the three of you  to roll perception checks if you can  sam whos the three vax vex and  liam 31 31  laura this is at advantage because its a dragonrelated thing  matt well are you looking for raishan or are you inspecting the room for details  laura i dont know what am i rolling for  matt i was rolling to see just the general vicinity of the room  laura okay 27  liam 31  marisha 25 /dung/  matt you guys the first thing you notice as you glance around is there are some kind of alcoves  inside this chamber where the rock formations pull inward you see kind of set into the stone and  various bits of fallen rock and earth a handful somewhat spread out throughout the room a handful  of large ninefoottall dark deep crimson red with crystalline elements to the outside ovoid  structures these are what appear to be larger than normal elementally altered dragon eggs five  of them in the chamber  laura five bebes  sam /none/ singing muppet babies  laura can i look back at thordak what does it look like i know raishan like gasps made him  do that does it look like theres anything around him or is he just deaddead still  matt hes a ways back if you want to try and move back to him you can but with your high  perception you glance up and see in the ceiling portion of this chamber where there are a number  of these small caverns that are pressed up to the side you see out of the top just /none/ the slight  peeking of raishans face kind of looking down into the chamber above you and you watch as the  teeth something muttering in the mouth the teeth grin as the ceiling of the room you watch  distortion in the air above you almost like these small portals kind of multiple fwooshes open  and coming flying out of them you see four large flaming rocks rocks these are massive fiery  meteoritelike boulders that come firing out of the ceiling of the room crashing sounds  slamming into the ground around you exploding in a massive /none/ explosions rocking you all you see is  white and ringing in your ears as your bodies are thrown from explosion to explosion i need the  three of you to make dexterity saving throws  liam 25  marisha i rolled a natural 19 so 22  laura 29  sam wow guys thats really good rolling  matt you guys take half damage well here lets do the first part so theres the fire damage  which is 20d6  liam what did we have to beat  matt you had to beat 22  liam zero  /none/ matt right so you take zero damage from this both of you take 63 points of fire damage halved  to 31 and then you each take 70 points of bludgeoning damage  marisha 70  travis thats 130something total points  matt as these flaming arcane meteors crash into the ground detonating and destroying a portion of  the cavern floor lava spatters everywhere and you watch as you duck out of the way as keyleth  what are your hit points at  marisha im actually still up at whats 101 minus 119 18 points  matt 18 /dung/ points set your hit points to that you watch as your sister is thrown her body  unconscious flung in the air like a ragdoll as it scatters to one end of the cavern you can see the  volcanic activity billowing up from the recent shaking of the room as bits of the molten rock  are flung across as the green dragon face kind of withdraws in the cave and i think thats where  were going to pick up next year  yelling  matt its 1122 guys we gotta get home  sam next year we /none/ have to wait a year  laura i have to find out if im for sure dead  liam i got you i got you  laura im across the fucking room  liam doesnt matter i can fly 500 feet i got

liam she just blew her wad shes done we got a dragon and a flute  laura shes not done  matt youre right she has nothing else up her sleeve so on that note  sam matt mercer  matt this could possibly be

needed to ask questions  sam of course she did she cast a big spell to do it  marisha yeah maybe she was doing it telepathically  sam what are you talking about she read a scroll /none/  laura maybe it was just taking his soul into herself  sam information  matt regardless laugh we are out for the evening thank you all for sticking with us for  this longer episode  liam we should have just let
