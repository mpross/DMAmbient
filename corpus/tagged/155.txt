none	 some critical role  dramatic music  matt welcome back as we left off last time to give you a little backstory vox machina put into  some sort of legal trouble in the city of vasselheim found themselves breaking a contract  for a guild called the slayers take that was essentially a monster hunters guild and all  kills near the city of this magnitude required approval so to make sure they werent sent to the  seat of judgment to essentially be arrested andor tried for this infraction they didnt realize they  made they were given 
none	 the opportunity to actually join the guild which they chose to do however  as part of joining it they had to go through a small trial in which the party was split and had  to go off to their own smaller contracts one half had journeyed through with our guests mary  elizabeth mcglynn and felicia day and they went after a white dragon they were awesome everyone  survived barely it was pretty rough and this adventuring party met as the second contract and  were given the task to seek out and destroy and harvest pieces 
none	 from a rakshasa a demonic entity  that stems from the nine hells and apparently was somewhere in the city masquerading as the  assistant to the owner of the velvet cabaret an establishment for upperclass pleasureseekers  the party after essentially forcing this individual to reveal themself the rakshasa fled  through a tunnel underneath its room into a long subterranean tunnel fraught with traps that were  set to protect it the party managed to avoid these rather deftly until the steady decline of  the hallway combined with the increasing moisture and scent of refuse caused a 
none	 slick surface and  our fantastic cleric brother kashaw slipped and fell down two party members keyleth and  tiberius decided itd be a fun time to go slipnsliding joined him at the bottom of the  tunnel where thorbir and vax stayed at the top shaking their heads with frustration upon  splashing down into what appeared to be some sort of underground cistern or a collection of compost  and refuse that had been just rotting food and all kinds of nasty stuff the party pulled themselves  up nearly waistdeep in this nasty substance began to hear 
none	 skittering and screeching sounds  throughout the room hundreds of small ones while two large thorny tentacles jettisoned out of  this call it a dung heap if you want and pulled itself to the surface with a central body filled  with teeth and one giant toothy maw and that was where we left off so in the nature of that i  would like everyone to roll initiative  wil even those of us that are very quietly walking slowly okay  matt you can continue slowly on your turn if youd like thats entirely up to you 
none	  will natural 20 plus two  marisha good start  orion ill take it thats 20 for me  wil well i guess that just leaves me then  marisha come on wil  wil two  laughter  matt and theyre off  will we pick up where we left off  liam we never left  will mit is just going come on  matt as a note because i forgot guys for subs tonight every hundred subscribers we get one  person in the chat will be chosen to win a signed cast picture and a 
none	 signed poster of one of our  artists kit busss wonderful art pieces for critical role signed by us as well  marisha and espionage cosmetic nail wraps  matt so we got some cool giveaways forgot that at the top anyway 20 and up  will 22  orion 20  matt all right ten to 15  liam 13  matt 13 all right  wil i dont know if you have numbers low enough two  matt keyleth what do you have  marisha six  matt six okay all right as the skittering seems to go 
none	 to a fervored frenzy you can see masses  and masses of extremely matted fur moving and quivering through this refuse as a series of rat  swarms pour out of the edges of this giant dung pile and where at the center that giant entity  has revealed itself to be a terrifying visage of some kind im going to have you go ahead and roll  an arcana check  orion 22  matt 22 immediately as soon as this creature comes out squelch this horrible guttural  bubbling sound its throat makes as it pulls itself out 
none	 of this nasty collection of refuse youve  read of this in quite a few tomes before in your travels this is known as an otyugh  orion a what  matt an otyugh  orion oh nasty things these otyughs  matt usually riddled with disease theyre controlled garbage disposals for those that can keep  control of them and it is kashaws turn  will do we get to know how dangerous they are to us  matt you currently have no idea  will are these creatures dangerous to us  orion yes  will so should 
none	 we just try to get rid of everything right now then as it were  orion theyre not even there yet  will theyre not with us at all yet are they  matt about 15 feet up you can see the opening of the tunnel where you guys slipped out and you  have no visual sight of the rest of your party which you guys were left in darkness by the way  you can see you have dim light so youre fine  orion whatever you do dont go up next to it right now  will 
none	 yeah can i cast some light turn on some light and see what we can see down there  matt well he still has his light spell  will oh were still lit up oh okay good  matt you can see this creature now growls  will okay now is there any chance that any kind of spell that i cast could hurt them even though  we cant see where they are  matt it depends on the spells radius if its relatively small then probably not theyre not  even within visual range so youd really have 
none	 to try hard to hit them at this point  will and how about the rest of us though how close are we to this thing and this cylinder  matt you guys are all about ten feet away from this giant creature right now  will yeah thats a pretty tight thing okay you know what i think im going to try to at least  slow this thing down as much as i can before everybody else gets down here i think thats the  best thing to do is just slow it down id like to cast 
none	 sacred flame  matt sacred flame  wil kash money  marisha laughs kash money  matt laughs kash money all right so go ahead and look at the spell  whats it require from you  will lets see its one action  matt okay so the target makes a dexterity saving throw lets see if it makes this what is your  spell dc  will my spell dc  matt should be at the top of your spell list  will where is that oh i see what youre saying yeah okay its a 16  matt 
none	 16 okay it does not make it as you bring out your holy symbol for a moment from beneath  your armor you look forward and thrust your spear forward this energy travels from the middle of  your torso across your arm down the spear and fires off as this burst of vibrant whitishblue  light that blasts into the front of this otyugh creature you deal 3d8 damage to it so go ahead  and roll eightsided dice three times  will eight now we need the full set right  marisha wait theyre all here heres an 
dung	 eight  will all right i got the eight here  wil if you need to roll a one you can use one of mine  marisha wait thats a ten thats a tensider this one  will so three right here we go  marisha big money no whammies  will thats all right eight and five and four  marisha thats really good  matt eight and five and four 17 damage impact growling you can see now it has the two giant  tentacles with these jagged spines that look covered in whatever its been climbing in 
none	 and this  one central stalk that has eyes across it and the eyes flicker in pain and wince and then  focus in on you and looks across your companions do you wish to move or do you want to stay where  you are  will yeah i would like to move once ive struck id like to get at least a little bit  farther away from it to try to distract it from the opening where these guys might be coming down  so the opposite side of the opening where these guys might drop in 
none	  matt okay so you can try and move closer this way probably youre now adjacent to one of the  rat swarms but youre pulling it away from the entrance here  liam are they rats or are they rouss  matt it looks like normalsized rats not that you would know because youre not in the room  but theres clusters and clusters of these rats swarming over each other  will were any of them affected at all by the sacred flame  matt no its just the singular target but if you have things that hit 
none	 larger areas they can  hit multiple guys that ends your turn next up is tiberius  orion i can move first right  matt you can yes  orion ill move around next to kashaw  matt next to him okay you will get free strikes from both the rat swarms currently because  youll be passing through there and out of their melee range you cool with that  orion no im not can i take a step back  matt you can this guy will still get an attack of opportunity on you  orion really i 
none	 thought i could move five feet  matt you can use an action to disengage  orion okay i wont do anything heres what im going to do instead im sorry i dont know what  was wrong ive been off and i apologize for how ive been sounding what im going to do is im  going to lift my finger and im going to aim behind that threeheaded bastard and im going to  release a 4thlevel fireball  matt over here  orion yes  matt show me with your laser pointer where you want the impact 
none	 to be  orion behind him where it wont hurt keyleth and will just hurt him wherever that is  matt okay id say thatd probably be right around this area here  orion im going to immediately spend two sorcery points and quicken spell and im going to turn  around and do three scorching rays to follow up the fireball right at that dude each head  matt okay  orion im going to on that spell spend another  matt wait up lets do the fireball first  orion okay  matt one thing at a time 
none	 so as you use your ring you focus the ray streaks past slams into  the wall behind explosion sound with a deafening roar and you guys definitely hear this the  hallway in the distance suddenly brightens up and you can see a bit of flame roll up and the scent  of smoke comes wafting past you as a wave of heat blasts through the tunnel  liam yeah he does that  matt whats the dc on your spells  orion 17  matt does not make the save so full damage on the otyugh  orion 
none	 wonderful so lets see heres a six  matt that rat swarm would also be hit  orion heres a five okay so im going to now  matt whats the damage on the fireball  orion hold on im going to spend one sorcery point to empower the spell and im going to pick  the six and reroll these four dice because i can reroll up to that many when i empower for that  damage perfect whats the total for that guys  matt singing math wizard math  wil math has no power here  liam 
none	 math is for everybody guys really  orion what is that nine thats 24 and then counting  matt were going to pimp out a calculator for him one day  marisha yes abacus  orion 48  matt 48 points of damage boom all right well after the fireball explosion settles you can see  theres a big char mark in the front of it some of its teeth have been blown into the inside of  its mouth the rat swarm behind keyleth is completely incinerated with a hundredsqueak  screeches and you can smell charred fur and 
none	 hair and flesh in the air  marisha oh you burned my new robes ugh  orion so im going to do that okay and then the scorching ray happens and im going to heighten  that spell which gives you disadvantage against the save is that what i want to do yeah thats  what im going to do  liam it feels like you just did 17 things  matt well no you have to make a ranged spell attack for each one  there is no saving throw for it  orion oh actually i dont do 
none	 that then i dont spend those points i was supposed to do  true strike to make that work d20s right  matt yep so roll for each ray  orion wonderful yeah they all hit i got a 14 an 18 a 19 and my  spell attack bonus is plus 11  matt okay they all hit  laughter  wil i saw that dm move of ill tell you if it hits i felt that  matt it was there and he was right 6d6 fire damage  orion ooh thats gross and im going to empower 
none	 that spell as well so its four and im going  to pick four out of these six no i rolled a six counts quietly 29  matt 29 all righty as each ray impact sounds you can see the flashing of the flaming light in  the air this darkened room is suddenly illuminated in bursts as each of these rays of  burning fire go blasting into the side of the otyugh its nearly pushed back into the pile that  it pulled itself from but steadies itself does that end your turn  orion yes it does 
none	  matt all right tiberiuss turn has come to an end  marisha ive knitted a sweater while tiberius took his turn  matt all right next up is the otyugh who is extremely unhappy with how that went down  growls you now see as it pulls from the front of its body one giant backwardslooking elephant leg  that steps into the front of the material a second one forward it pulls itself completely  out of the pile and you can see a third one like a giant tripod these thick legs carry it forward  it 
none	 is going to do a bite attack and a tentacle attack on you and a tentacle attack on keyleth  as youre the nearest to it so as it rears back with its mouth this giant maw opens with all  these nasty jagged broken teeth and the smell that comes out of its mouth is horrifying even  for your experience as a dragonborn that would be 18 to hit  orion did you roll at disadvantage  matt why would i have disadvantage  orion cloak of displacement  matt oh good call oh thats even higher 19 
none	 but thank you for the reminder  thats good to know  orion ac is 18  matt so it hits  liam now go home and get your shine box  matt so as youre hanging back and your image is shifting and shimmering nearby its mouth is just  too big and as it bites down while it would have partially hit the side it manages to find your  proper location the teeth clomp down onto you you take 16 points of piercing damage as you  grunts reach back in pain you push yourself out of 
none	 its mouth i need you to make a constitution  saving throw  orion 22  matt 22 okay so you pull off and away you can see where it dragged across your scales it left  this nasty trail of black whatever you would call it saliva but you manage to slip it off  your hand and you feel like its probably not going to bother you too much however as you  steady yourself one of the tentacles comes swinging down towards you that is also with  disadvantage that would be a 21 to hit  
none	 orion yeah that hits  matt all right you take seven points of bludgeoning damage from the impact thats only  four points of piercing damage as the spines slam into your side and seem to stick onto you you are  also considered grappled and restrained for the time as the tentacle wraps around you and the  spines are digging into your body it now has you by your waist and is holding you in place  orion this is fun how much damage is that total  matt thatd be a total of 11 damage  orion 
none	 really plus the other damage  matt plus the bite no did you not write down the bite damage i told you  orion thats 16 so 26 27 so whats half of that  matt half of that  orion because of the stoneskin my stoneskin is still up  matt stoneskin is still up that is correct how long does that last  orion hour  matt hour yeah that shouldve lasted long enough youre fine yeah so half of that  wouldve been  orion i cast that when we were chasing him  matt yeah 13 
none	 points of damage  orion okay 13 points  matt that was a lot of technicality in one turn well done tiberius all right  wil spellcasters  matt that will be a 23 against you  marisha yeah  matt that turns done thatll be a total of 14 points of bludgeoning damage to you and five  points of piercing damage and you are also grappled by the other tentacles here you are both  currently being held to the sides of the creature  marisha 14 and five you said  matt correct that brings us to 
none	 vax  liam were how high up from here  matt about 15 feet up and youre that far back  liam were that far back all right so it takes my whole movement just to run to the edge  probably yeah  matt counting yeah pretty close right there thats your turn  liam and thats it bonus action right  matt bonus action if you want it yeah  liam but i cant see can i see past the lip of the edge to the top of that  matt whatever youre trying to hit might have 
none	 threequarters cover  liam sighs thats it  matt okay that ends your turn now the swarms moving in each one of these rats swarms start  crawling up towards your body and theyre starting to find their way into your armor and  theyre biting its a terrible experience swarm attacking keyleth is going to be a 16 to hit  marisha nope  matt nope you brush them off yourself  marisha i look at them and i go rat noises  matt laughs the rat whisperer attacking you brother kash that looks like its going to be 
none	 a  ten to hit  will okay so now what  matt whats your armor class  will my armor class is where there its 20  matt 20 these rats come forward and you whack knock them out of the way with your shield  against tiberius that is going to be with disadvantage  orion man they cant touch me im up in the air yo  matt youre grappled but youre not floating in the air  orion aw man i thought he was whipping me around  matt not yet  marisha laughs not yet 
none	  matt thats going to be a 13 so its going to miss you so the rats no effect yet that ends  their turn keyleth youre up  marisha i take the tentacle thats grappled around me and i grab onto it and i cast blight  matt all right  marisha it has to make a constitution saving throw  matt what level is blight blight is 4th  marisha 3rd  matt all right constitution saving throw that is an 11 whats your dc  im pretty sure it fails  marisha 18  matt okay it 
none	 takes 8d8 necrotic damage go ahead and roll damage  marisha yes it does  will nice work  marisha whered all my d8s go  will you gave them to me you very nicely gave them to me  marisha heres one ooh theres four so five six seven i just like rolling all of them i  could roll okay thats all right theres ten theres 20 theres 35 sorry yes 36 damage  matt 36 damage  marisha yes  matt nice as you grab the tentacle you can see the slippery slimy flesh and it has 
none	 the residue  on it as your fingers grasp into it its brownishyellow color all of a sudden turns into  this grayish sickly dried landscape as you can see the flesh cracking to dust around it the  tentacles still grasping onto you the magical energy travels up the side of what would be its  torso and body and you can see it beginning to withdraw through severe pain it manages to  eventually shrug off any further spread of the magical disease of the blight but it has left  this horrible scarring across one side of 
none	 its whole body you cant really move this turn since  youre currently restrained  marisha its fine  matt yep all right that brings us to thorbir what you got  wil im going to continue down this corridor to get close to the halfelf  matt thats a full round of movement there  wil thats all i can do leave something for me  matt all right that ends that thats going to bring us to the top kashaw your turn  will is the side that she damaged useless at this point the one tentacle  
none	 matt no its still functional still wrapped around her theres scarring across it and a large  part of its upper torso torso its weird to say parts of its body when it has that strange  construction  wil dont attach your body norms to it man  matt laughs i apologize  liam are you bodyshaming that otyugh  will shouldnt we id like to move as much directly in front of the creature as possible  matt okay thatll get you there that one rat swarm does get a free attack on you as you move  
none	 past it that is going to be an 11 you can see the rats swarming up your legs and trying to get  past but the armors too thick and the chain mails too strong underneath the plate you have  and you brush them off as you move to the side pulls you right up in front of it now its giant  mouth is chomping sounds angrily gnashing and biting down in front of you and its sending bits  of that brackish spittle across your face and smells horrifying what are you doing  will id like 
none	 to try to take control of it with geas see if i can tell this bitch what to do  marisha do it  will not you  marisha i was hoping you werent talking about me  will id never call you bitch  matt okay the casting time for geas is one minute  will okay  matt knowing that every combat round is equivalent to six seconds so you could try it it  probably wont survive that long but hold onto that spell for now is there another one youd  like to use  will 
none	 i will hold onto that yeah i think then im going to try how about just another sacred  flame for now  matt sure go ahead and roll to attack sir no this one it just makes its saving throw i forgot  all right cool its going to attempt at making another dexterity saving throw that is a 14 and  that does not beat it so go ahead and roll 3d8 points of damage to it radiant damage tiberius  youre on deck  marisha oh nice not bad  will 16  matt 16 points of 
none	 damage nice yes impact sounds once again the flames burst up and you  can see parts of its body where the scarring is across it all of a sudden explode with light and  beneath you can see the freshly exposed grayishbrown fleshy muscle beneath its outer  armored structure it is looking a little rough that ends your turn that brings us to tiberius  orion hes got me like this right yeah sure im going to cast true strike on him cantrip  matt true strike on yourself  orion on him  matt on him  
none	 orion im going to look for a weakness thatll give me advantage on my next  matt attack roll against the target okay  orion then im going to quicken spell and spend two more sorcery points to cast well im going  to look over can i see where vax and him are coming  matt currently no there is so much going on in the room and the only light source is you right  now you have no inclination that theyre even at the top at this point and youre currently  wrapped in a tentacle and 
none	 being swarmed by rats you have no way of telling that theyve even  arrived at this point  orion i can see behind the creature though because thats within range so i will do misty  step behind him and get out of that grip  matt all righty misty step is a 2ndlevel  orion yes  matt all right to where do you want to go  orion as far away behind him as i can go  matt there you go  orion and that is my turn  matt all righty ending your turn the 
none	 otyugh turns around angrily now it looks it has its  empty tendril its going to step away you do get one brother kash as it steps away you get one  free attack with your spear as it tries to move away from you  will okay  matt so go ahead and roll an attack with your spear  will that is a d20 14  matt plus your attack bonus  will attack bonus is  marisha oh plus nine  matt oh that definitely hits so go ahead and roll damage for the spear  will 
dung	 damage for the spear  marisha which is 1d8 plus three  will 1d8 plus three wheres my d8 ten  matt so as it moves away stomping sounds you reach out and whoosh hit it with the spear  leaving this big old gaping wound in the side where more of its dark blood begins to spill out  from the wound as it moves over its going to go ahead and do one bite attack towards keyleth with  its open mouth thats going to be a 24  marisha that hits  matt all right thats going 
none	 to be 16 points of piercing damage to you and make a constitution  saving throw  marisha 16  matt 16 you can feel the diseased liquid that fills the inside of the otyughs mouth begin to  pulse into your arm for a second you tense and eventually the pain and numbness tends to fade  within a few seconds however as you take that moment to yourself as its still grabbing you  with the one tentacle its going to reach and attack twice towards tiberius  that is going to be a 16  orion nope 
none	  matt okay thatll be a 19  orion yes  matt so the second one hits you that is eight points of bludgeoning damage and five points so  13 half that because of stoneskin that puts you at seven points of damage and you are once again  grappled and wrapped up by it  orion i think he likes me  matt i think you pissed it off when you set it on fire multiple times in a row  will we could use a little help down here  liam coming  matt that ends its 
none	 turn vax youre up  liam okay im going to run up to the edge of it are any of my friends  right up against this nasty shit  matt currently keyleth is right next to it  liam keyleth so if its occupied with my friend i can take a second aim really well and sneak  attack from up here okay so that is 24  matt 24 that hits definitely  liam all right so sneak attack  marisha oh good you showed up  liam thats a two plus nine this is keen dagger nine 
none	 plus 12 17 21 thats 21 30  matt 30 points of damage all right  liam and the second dagger which is lifestealing hits with a 24  matt that hits definitely  liam that is eight  matt eight all right you still have the rest of your movement if you want to stay up there or wish  to move somewhere  liam nope just going to perch  matt okay cool all right  matt ending vaxs turn the rats now move up this one is going to go there attacking keyleth  you are currently 
none	 restrained tiberius you are also restrained so attacks against you have  advantage thatll be a 19 against you  marisha yeah  matt against tiberius it just has a general attack roll because you give it disadvantage on  attacks that is going to be a 17 which i think misses you all right keyleth you take nine  points of piercing damage as the rats are now swarming up over the side of the tentacle and  biting at your neck and shoulder area and youre trying to brush them off of you  marisha no squeaking noises 
none	  matt rats arent your friends anymore that finishes their turn it is now your turn  keyleth  marisha my turn okay are rats swarming me  matt yep  marisha this guys looking pretty close to dead yeah  matt hes looking pretty hurt  marisha hes looking pretty hurt im going to do it again im going to do blight again  matt blight again against this guy  marisha yeah im still grappled right  matt you are yes  marisha so just same thing im just going to sucking sound try and  suck the 
none	 life out of this guy  matt all right  marisha constitution saving throw  matt that is going to be a 13  marisha laughs counts i need one more wheres it at big money no whammies ooh thats not  bad okay so thats 14 15 16 24 30 32 35 41 45  matt 45 points of damage from blight so this time as the rats are swarming over you you reach  up your hands theyre glowing with the energy that youre drawing from this you can see the  actual air around her hands beginning 
none	 to turn black and the air is beginning to be pulled in  what was once a very moist and warm vicinity gets strangely cold as now her hands embody the end of  life she grasps the tentacle and the rats scatter as the proximity grows as you touch it  you can see now what was once the blights scarring begins to fill the entire tentacle and as  it turns it hardens around you almost like a brittle piece of concrete the rest of its body  cracking you see it begins to roars starts thrashing about 
none	 its tendril releases you  tiberius dropping you into a pile of refuse as it reaches around to try and grasp its own  tentacle shattering sound it breaks through its own arm as it reels back you fall onto your  butt the rest of the broken pieces of otyugh crumbling into dust around you you look up and  see the creature as it attempts to back up each one of its legs pulling up against the one door  thats partially buried in the far corner it slams into the side as the blight spreads across  
none	 its body its teeth begin to shatter and turn to dust within its mouth which begins to slowly curl  inward as it ages extremely rapidly in a short period of time suddenly it slumps to the ground  gurgling sound and joins the refuse of which it once came from  marisha dead  matt thorbir  wil you were supposed to save something for me  orion theres a bunch of rats down here  wil rats  will walk faster  wil clunk clunk to the edge there how far down is it  matt 15 feet 
none	 and it is soft ground  wil can i jump and land on those rats  matt you know what sure go ahead and make an athletics check  marisha come on you can do it  wil okay 17  marisha its rats  matt you leap slam down on top of the rat swarm that just jettisoned off the side of keyleth im  going to say for that impact go ahead and roll 1d6 it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from you  stepping on a few of the rats  wil six  matt six all righty 
none	 and theyre now all around you on the ground and theyre trying to swarm away  from the impact zone you still have your action  wil okay so i havent played a character this highlevel in this system so bear with me while i  walk through this i believe that i can attack three times in a round right i have the extra  attack feature  matt yes as a fighter you do you have three attacks  wil okay so im going to take my axe and just try to kill as many of these things 
none	 as i possibly  can so i swing my axe  matt all right  wil and i roll a two  matt all right you swing your axe for the first batch of rats unfortunately its hard to see  where the compost pile and the rats separate you cleave through a bunch of the slimy mess slinging  a bunch of it against the wall and as you spatter a bit against keyleth whos behind you roll for  your next attack  wil very unhappy about that okay three hows that hole looking its a great hole 
none	 right  matt you decide as opposed to a small swath lets make it a wider one and your axe swings  again this time you catch a singular rat but with the flat of the blade and you send it flying  about ten feet where it comes back unharmed and joins the rest of its crew  wil just getting warmed up and a one  will it cant be real it cant be real  liam that is cg that is computergenerated  matt this time in an angry fury that you are being stifled by what 
none	 is essentially sewer rats  you lift your axe up in the air as one rat has climbed up your pants  bites you right in the crotch  wil dont touch it dont do that okay yes it does  matt in pain you drop the axe behind you and reach down and grab the rat and tear it in half  out of frustration and anger and i will give you a point of damage for that  wil a point of damage the rat bit through my metal codpiece  matt it snuck up past the small 
none	 little gap there and ate through your leather britches and you are  in severe pain nearing prone  wil well i mean us dwarves are known for our dicks that are sensitive to rat bites  matt this is true they didnt put that in the players handbook but i think theyre going to  amend it too  wil oh its canon in my game  matt and with that thorbirs turn is up  wil yeah it sure is excuse me i must inform the internet of my majesty  liam you got your dick bit by 
none	 a rat son youre a man now  will laughs youre a man now  matt every dwarf when they hit the tender age of 30 has to wander waistdeep into the rat pits  all right kashaw youre up  will first i would like to turn to thorbir and say are you kidding me how many rats are left  matt you have the group that is currently swarming around thorbir one immediately to your  left that youre batting away with your shield and one group that is currently trying to get all  up in tiberiuss 
none	 shit  will can we tell whos in the most danger at this point  matt for the most part everyone seems to be doing okay hes looking the roughest from a  situational  marisha thats just a bruised ego thats different  will yeah i think i would like to move to come to strongcastles defense over here  orion stormwind  will right  matt all right so there we go the rats do get a swing at you that is going to be thats not  going to hit once again you hear the little small 
none	 tings against the back of your armor but  its not even a bother at this point all right what are you doing you move up to the rats  will once again because again people i need some help im a healer for gods sakes so im  going to try sacred flame again  matt all right which im going to say you stayed a step back on because its a ranged attack so  you get real close once again set your spear down real fast grab your holy symbol and then release  that burst go 
none	 ahead and roll for attack actually no its a saving throw again thats my  end the rats roll a one go ahead and roll straight damage on that its 3d8  will oh the 3d8s thats right im sorry  matt its all good  will here are the d8s right  wil you know if youre me you only have to roll once  will thats not that great eight  matt eight points of damage you release it and you can see about 13 14 rats get thrown and  scattered their lifeless burnt corpses pattering sound 
none	 around and the little hole that you left  in the middle of that pile closes up as the rats form once again into a coalesced swarm that  ends your turn i believe thatll bring us to tiberius  marisha kill some rats  orion what the hell are we in  matt its a giant cylindrical it looks like it was once a cistern that has been turned into some  sort of a refuse  orion is there a roof  matt from what you can see roll a perception check  orion what do i use 
none	  matt perception its a skill you dont use it very often  orion 15 no 14  matt as far as you can see it goes up maybe 30 or so feet beyond the radius of your light spell  and fades into darkness you have no idea if theres a ceiling or end to it or how far it would  be if there was one  orion okay well ive got one right next to me right  matt you do  orion im going to put out my hand and im going to do a firebolt 
none	 right next to that one  matt okay go ahead and roll to attack with disadvantage  orion why are they on me  matt yeah theyre right up against you ranged attacks when youre in melee with the target  its at disadvantage  orion oh right well then im going to not do that im going to cast obelisk of stone and then  quicken spell and then im going to do a firebolt thats what im going to do  matt okay  orion yeah  wil avenge me  matt obelisk of stone puts you up 
none	 on top there  orion about ten feet and then ill do the 2d10 damage  matt all righty  orion d10s heres one  will all right i think i have one  matt roll to hit first  orion is it a d10 do what now roll to hit first  liam you need d10s  orion yes thank you is that a spell attack roll thats 31  matt 31 yeah that hits swarm of rats not too hard to hit really  orion cool so thats 11 so thats 16  matt 16 all right you 
none	 lift up onto your tenfoot platform as this stone pushes up from  beneath all of the slime and as it emerges it sends this spilling cluster of whatever was at the  bottom of this you have to keep your footing as you go up in fact because of this room im  going to go ahead and have you roll a dexterity saving throw  orion what is that 12  matt 12 so you get the attack off but you lose your footing from the slick nature of the obelisk  you just created and you will 
none	 plummet off and fall prone into the refuse to the side of the  obelisk but you still get the damage off on the spell as you blast whoa and tiberius you  tumble off the side its a soft impact you only fall ten feet it doesnt do any damage but you  are currently prone on the ground next to your obelisk  liam refuse is code for shit  matt i believe that ends your turn you havent moved yet so you could technically use your  movement to get up from prone if you wanted  
none	 orion oh ill do that  matt okay cool that ends your turn hes gone vax youre up  liam im staying safe up here im going to throw more daggers theres a little pile under  thorbirs hiney and a little bit out by itself right  matt right here yes  liam are they spilling out from under the dwarfs hiney or are they all hidden  matt no theyre all around him theyre sharing the same space  liam okay im going to throw daggers at the one thats biting his ass so its a sneak attack 
none	  thats not good thats 13  matt so a 13 that hits  liam oh hey rats  matt rats are easy to hit  liam oh right  wil no theyre not  laughter  will usually they are  liam thats two plus seven is nine plus 11 12 17 18 19 21 is the first dagger and i send the  next one down if the last one hit this one hits so thats 21 and the second dagger  is a ten so 31  matt 31 damage total all right you notice that because 
none	 of the nature of the swarm what would  normally be a creature that you could do a shitton of damage to knowing its physicality it  seems like a lot of the physical attacks arent as effective as you would like however this swarm  has already taken a few hits and as you carve through dagger after dagger eventually you pick  off the remainder of the rats and the swarm is dissipated the few ones that are stragglers  realizing that safety in numbers is missing begin to curl their ways back underneath the piles they  
none	 clawed from originally  wil i was doing fine  matt that ends your turn at the end of your turn the other two rat swarms also realizing  the circumstance is bad fightorflight kicks in and they flee and crawl back underneath  marisha smart rats  liam cheese  will mickey mouse voice haha i think im going to flee lets all swarm come on we can do it  matt so you all take a moment take your breath you get back up  liam im going to hop down in the shit and loop an arm 
none	 under thorbirs arm come on old man  will hows your dick  wil i dont want to talk about it  orion i prestidigitate all the crap off  matt okay  will is she still on the ground or has she gotten up  matt youve gotten back up shes still spattered  will you ruined your new dress  marisha i know i got scorched by tiberiuss fireball  will you fought well though  wil im looking for the way out of here im looking to see where the rakshasa went  matt looking on the 
none	 far side its partially buried in the ground from the collection here but  you can see there is a bit of a push like the door had been opened briefly and pushed things  away then slammed shut and its slowly starting to coalesce back towards it  liam all right hold on everybody i walk right toward it perception checking the area around it  and the door itself thats 24  matt 24 the door appears to be a normal door nothing strange about its presentation however  upon checking the handle on the edge of it 
none	 it does appear to be locked  liam locked all right well i pull out my little sack and i pull out one of these twing  and go to work on it that is a 28  matt 28 in a matter of seconds this is an oldschool lock and one that is generally used  for not very securityrequired rooms flick of the wrist click creak the door pushes inward a  little bit and you have to get your strength in to push back the cluster of dried and liquid plant  matter that is rotting against 
dung	 it with just enough of a gap to push through into a dark room  beyond it looks like  liam i fonzied it  matt you did kind of  liam and marisha fonzie impressions hey  liam okay tiberius are you still lighting up this room  matt he is currently the only light source yes  liam okay so theres probably a little bit of light going in there so im trying to look in to  see what i can see from his spillin there  matt okay glancing into the next room you can see 
none	 theres a little bit of a trickle of liquid  that has spilled from underneath the doorway from this room and you get the feeling this door isnt  open very often if at all and the little bit of slime that has coasted through only goes about  five ten feet into a long stone hallway that disappears in the darkness no more than maybe 20  feet from you even with the low light you can see pretty far to the right and left of you  though sets of iron bars  liam okay tibs follow that 
none	 try and keep behind me and i throw up the hood and go as low to the  ground as i can and i start to gollum along the floor looking at the ground in front of me in the  dim light trying to see if i can see any traps ahead of me  matt okay go ahead and make a perception check  liam 25  matt 25 as you begin walking into the hallway you go past and you start to notice from the  visual around you theres smooth stone floor the iron bars are 
none	 all the way across with some  partitions between this is in particular a subterranean holding facility some sort of an  underground prison and its very quiet and there is no light in here there are sconces set up but  it looks like there have been no recent torches set  liam hear anything  matt hearing you hear nothing it is absolutely still and quiet  liam i grab my earring lets do it and i start moving forward  marisha i follow him  matt the rest of you guys continue with him  wil i 
none	 come up to the door and see what i can see with my darkvision  matt okay glancing inside as well you can see the prison goes on for as far as your visual range  is about 60 feet there are four sets of prison cells on each side so there are eight cells total  and the hallway continues past that but you cant quite see beyond those initial four on each side  you can glance on the inside you can see what looks like dried and brittle thatch that was once  used to cover the 
none	 floor has slowly molded over time to your left you see what looks to  be elements of a skeletal corpse that was left for a very long period of time in the cell immediately  to your left as you look through the doorway  wil ill continue on  matt okay as you enter this area and start stepping in the air itself has a very chemical  smell to it its hard to describe theres something musty and untouched to the air but  theres also some sort of gentle hint of an acrid scent do you 
none	 guys continue forward through this  prison area  liam im looking at the floor and everything as far out as i can see ahead of me  matt okay  marisha whats above us  matt looking up its about 15 feet up and it is another smooth stone ceiling the construction  here looks old you specifically go ahead and make a perception check with advantage because  you are a dwarf  wil 12 plus whatever do i roll again  matt yeah roll again as youre a dwarf and this is an underground stone structure  
none	 wil oh nine so 15  matt okay thats not bad looking at the stonework here its definitely created for  function more than any sort of presentory functionality you gather from looking at the  nearby pieces of the stone wall that connects with the first set of metal bars that this was probably  carved a few hundred years ago and the metal bars as you move past you guys see this too the  doorways that lead into these some appear to be locked and some are completely open easy to  swing and as you pull 
none	 it open creak very heavy rust against those iron doors probably affected  largely by the nearby moisture emanating from the room and whatever chemicals hanging in the air  will are we still lit  matt youre still lit by his light spell yes  marisha and theres nothing really in the prison cells with the exception of one skeleton  matt well that was in one room if you want to go ahead and check around go ahead and make an  investigation check  liam i thought we would have seen it here  marisha yeah ill 
none	 look around in the cells natural 20  matt there is balance to the universe as youre walking past keyleth looking over on one side  you see further up with a bunch of the thatch pushed around it there appears to be a corpse  that doesnt have the layer of dust that a number of the other skeletal piles in some of the other  cells seem to have the door to get into the cell though does appear to be locked  marisha vax need your help this is locked  liam whats in there  marisha 
none	 looks like a fresh dead guy  liam okay out comes the pick im going to perception check that corpse through the cell  thats a 12  matt its hard to tell its mostly covered with a lot of this thatch it doesnt look like it was  intentionally covered but some sort of a struggle took place in this room  liam now for the door natural 20  wil youre welcome  laughter  wil i work in mysterious ways  matt the lock on this its not an intricate lock but it is very heavily rusted 
none	 and as soon  as you start moving in there you realize that there is actually something metal that has been  broken off inside whether by a previous key just through accident or intent it was broken off  inside you manage to find a way to remove it pull the piece out and still get the lock open  the gate swings open and you guys enter to inspect this corpse looking at it you notice  that the body has been probably dead for a couple months it is in prolonged state of decomposition  but there 
none	 is still some semblance of flesh sloughing off the remnants of the bone you can  see from the wounds that it has received that a large portion of it has been torn open very  violently and elements of it have been removed the softer organs  wil is it wearing any clothing  matt as you inspect it you look and see that while smashed with blood and dirt and dust the  outfit does appear to be that of a duskmeadow bastion  liam i feel really terrible but im going to give him the old halfelven 
none	 patdown and see if i  can find anything on his personage  matt looking about his entire body anything of value has been taken  will can i speak with him  matt can you what  will id like to cast speak with dead  matt you can  will lets find out what killed him  liam you can do that  will yes i can do many things  liam thats badass  marisha and hes a duskwhat bastion  matt duskmeadow which is the section of vasselheim that worships the raven queen the guys  
town	 that you encountered earlier in the road the dark studded leather armor with the cloak swept  over one arm  liam you know hes dead right  wil i cast annoyed dwarf to know that he was likely killed by the rakshasa why are we standing  in this room  will i want to know when he was killed  wil im not stopping you  matt okay so as you sit down and you begin preparing your ritual you once again mutter under  your breath and begrudgingly pull out your symbol as you continue casting the 
none	 spell theres a  slight shimmer of greenishblue light that slowly pours over the corpse seeps into the bones and  for a moment you see kashaw go into this trancelike state kashaw you see from within the  corpse the face sits up with this horrible cracking bonelike sound the skeletal element  with this partially mummified and mostly rotten face steps forward and the vacuous sockets that  once held its eyes turn towards you and you could swear you see the bone of its grimace grin as it  airily whispers towards you why do you bother 
none	 me  will because i have questions  matt what questions do you have  will what killed you  matt something that was not supposed to be here something vicious something untrue it wasnt  what it seemed this woman was asking for help and no ones supposed to be down here if its not  their route occasionally we come and check on these abandoned parts of the prison a woman was  here a woman should not be down here i went to ask what was wrong and she took this from me  and the bony 
none	 hand reaches up and gestures to the throat and you can see theres giant claw marks  across the front of its spinal cord where its neck is that give the sensation that something tore its  throat out  will a woman did this to you  matt aye  marisha shapeshifter  will or theres more than one when when were you killed  matt 14 weeks have passed i was resting  will anybody have questions hes not going to be here long i can tell you that not at 14 weeks  marisha ask him if 
none	 he knows which direction he went and if he has a hideout  will which direction she went you mean  marisha well he or she or whatever it was  will did you see which direction she went after she killed you  matt she walked away laughing and eating parts of me i have not seen her since but others walk  these halls ive seen a dwarf pass through two or three times and as it did and passed my cell it  laughed sometimes guards come to inspect but none have found me none have found 
none	 me yet  will are all the guards that come bastions of the raven queen  matt we are the ones to protect the amaranthine oubliette that is our job here you sit in the  lower forgotten halls of the oubliette my final resting place  will stormcloud any questions  orion i think weve learned all we can from this one  marisha which direction was the dwarf walking  will you can answer her what direction was the dwarf going  matt the other hand creeps up from underneath the thatch as you guys are watching this 
none	 the corpse  is doing nothing its just lying there he is talking to an unmoving corpse for your vision  the hand reaches over and points in the direction you guys came from  will so it went the way we came  matt that was two weeks ago  marisha but he said hes been coming and going so maybe he was just leaving  will coming the same direction we came from though that seems odd and a man  a dwarf and a woman  liam weeks ago not five minutes ago  matt the spell 
none	 fades and the corpse falls back to its original pose jaw left open aghast in its  final moments  liam thorbirs right were burning time we need to go in  will go in where do we go back the direction the dwarf came  orion i rolled a 23 arcana check on thorbirs jeweled knife that he gave me  matt just so you guys are aware you are essentially in this vicinity of the prison this  was the room where you found the corpse here and youve seen just enough light begin to reveal  there 
none	 is a secondary prison room up here  will im sorry but we came from that direction  matt from this door yes this wouldve connected right there  will okay  wil every second were here its getting away  orion i agree  liam youre absolutely right were going in when were in there you keep it busy and i will  carve it up  wil i will keep it busy  will try not to get your dick bit by a rat  liam i slide past tiberius crouch down to the ground again and start 
none	 scuttling along the  ground looking listening  orion what was the ruling on the arcana check  matt for  orion the jeweled knife that thorbir gave me  matt the knife does not appear to have any sort of magical aura about it its just a very  wellcrafted and probably relatively expensive piece of functionality or ornamental use its a  very fine blade though it would be a fine thing to enchant if you were inclined to  orion kashaw how close are you to your god  will at one time very close now i 
none	 dont think youd want to be anywhere near her  marisha and which god is that  will my god is called vesh and i am the only one on the planet who has ever heard of her yeah she  killed everybody else want to talk to her  orion i dont  will no neither do i  marisha why did she spare you  will because im her husband  orion oh how is that being married to a god thats rather inconvenient  marisha and how does that happen in the first place  wil thorbir 
none	 sighs heavily and steps into the room and follows vax  marisha we can walk and talk you guys go  matt so youre walking forward  will she married me at birth my mother was told that i was a special child which is why i had the  yellow eyes i had two when i was born we were married at birth she killed everyone in the  village on my 15th namingday she came to consummate the marriage i made the first 50  slashes on my right arm she made the next 50 for a ritual 
none	 called the sting of the hundred and when  my blood mixed with her sweat i gained all her memories thats when i found out she was  essentially the devil i was raised as a healer because i wasnt just supposed to be her husband  but also her balance because the universe wouldnt accept somebody as black as her  in it tried to kill her at 15 havent seen her since  orion ooh so its not like you can ask for a favor i suppose  will i suppose i could but theres a good chance 
none	 shell kill you me and everyone around at the  same time  matt at this point in time as you guys are having this conversation you moved up and looked  and you can see there are two humanoids walking from this direction further down this hallway  which you can see leads this direction  liam id like to imagine that thorbir and vax left that conversation behind a little  matt as you see them approaching here stepping in your direction they are both dressed in full  duskmeadow bastion armor the one on the far end 
none	 appears to be older balding with thinning gray  hair the one whos further up is in his forties big thick brown beard hair pulled back into a  ponytail and theyre both lightly conversing to each other not paying much attention like  theyre running through a routine  liam i start pushing back on thorbir backing everybody up silently pushing backward and trying  to steer everyone in a heap backwards and to the side of the cell we just came from  just trust me  matt make a stealth check  liam 19  matt 19 
none	 okay as youre pushing everyone back shushing whispering all this you hear a voice  say hello hold on hello the one with the beard approaches with his hand on his weapon the  other one moving along the back  liam did i get them into the cell  matt you pushed them far back and into the cell  liam yeah that was what i wanted to do just backwards to everybody  orion yeah and as this is going on i dissipate the light spell  matt okay light spell vanishes he walks up and turns the 
none	 corner  liam i give everybody a group hug with my cloak of elvenkind and try to make a big rag pile out of  this corner im very uncomfortably pressed against thorbirs backside  matt okay the cloak can only really cover you and partially another person the rest of you all  make a stealth check  marisha so whos it partially covering  liam laughs thorbir  marisha thorbir  matt no its not enough to really effectively do it to another person its just more for flavor  liam its the thought that counts  marisha 
none	 15  will five  orion 20  wil a viewer whose chat name begins with a u i wont identify the viewer in case this goes  badly sent me these dice and said may they roll well i would like to apologize in advance for  what is about to happen to this persons beloved dice its a 15 oh look at that it turns out  that there are twodigit numbers on these dice  laughter  wil and my stealth is two so thats 17  matt 17 all right so the guy walks into the 
none	 room looks back and forth the one behind him  steps forward into the room a bit the other one steps behind him looks about looks from one side  of the room looks over to your room theres almost a glimmer of recognition in his eye and  continues walking past they just start walking back the direction you guys came from  marisha uh  matt the other one  marisha i throw up a wall of stone  matt where  marisha right there  matt right there  marisha to lock them in  will that 
none	 wasnt quiet  matt wall of stone goes up  liam muffled what the fuck  wil how long does that last  marisha its permanent  wil lets go  will its time to move  liam all right back around the corner following around looking listening everybody the same  matt that chemical smell is getting stronger and stronger its burning your nose a little bit  marisha so kashaw if youre the only one who knows about this goddess that means she also  killed your parents  will yes thank you for bringing that up  
none	 liam perception i got you baby well that was perception  wil so im attempting to make a perception roll to see if i can pull anything out of these smells  maybe based on my experience with smithing and the chemicals that are associated with all that sort  of thing but i did roll a three so i guess i would add a three the best i can get out of that  is a nine  matt okay you sniffs and it clears your sinuses up pretty well much like a fresh dab of  wasabi your 
none	 nostrils are a little more open because its not sulfurous it doesnt have  something similar to what youd find in smithing in your experience at the very least its hard  to really place where it comes from you said youre going which way  liam towards that other door that they did not come out of  matt this here all right  liam 23 i rolled perception  matt 23 you approach the door this door is locked it does not appear to be trapped  liam okay lets unlock it  matt okay  liam that 
none	 is a 21  matt okay as you reach down to the lock and you place the picks inside start fiddling you look  at the iron around it and the actual metal seems to be frosting over you pull back your head and  as you exhale your breath becomes visible and the temperature seems to drop significantly and as  soon as you look up at the wood something shimmers in the wood and its a humanoid face  that just pushes out of the wood  liam can i use uncanny dodge to roll backward right now 
none	  matt right now  marisha oh my god  wil do we see this happening  matt you guys are hearing his reaction to this just happen in the front there im going to go  ahead and say sure  orion are there torches down this hallway  matt so one of the hands comes through reaching out for you this ghostly arm  just swings towards you  liam and i say nope  matt id like to have everybody roll initiative  marisha oh again man were going to run into everything  orion are there 
none	 torches in this hallway  matt no  will lighting open flame of any kind  matt currently no  will ten  wil 11  matt all right so we have 20 or higher anyone  orion yes 21  matt all right 20 to 15 15 to ten  wil 11  will i had ten yeah  matt there we go all right nine to five  marisha nine  matt all right and then  liam 11 as well i roll back going squeals  matt all right tiberius youre up first as you see these 
none	 two drifting humanoid translucent  ghostly entities drift out the door that vax was at as he leaps backward a second one drifts out  of the stone down the hallway and turns towards the group both of them giving these horrible low  moaning sounds moans their feet are dragging about a foot off the ground  orion ill point to the one coming from opposite of vax  matt there  orion that guy  matt that guy all right  orion and then im going to do true strike on him and ill back away  matt 
none	 back away  orion thats good thats my turn  matt cool all right they go next this one is going to drift forward now the one that swiped  at you as you dodge backward it drifts forward and its arms reach out for you and attempt to  pierce the front of your chest go ahead and make a charisma saving throw  liam okay i will do that  matt keyleth you do the same as the spirit suddenly  marisha a charisma saving throw  matt yes flickers and appears right before you  liam 11 
none	  matt 11  marisha okay 11  matt okay  liam marisha and will cartoonish ghost  noises  matt you guys watch as both of these ghostly entities whoosh completely slip into the  physical form of vax and keyleth who each shudder for a second as their eyes glaze over both the  entities are no longer visible however you feel the presence of a cold invading mind full of  anger and distant loss and rage fill your brain and your body is not your own  marisha sorry guys  liam this is going to 
none	 be fun  matt suddenly you see vax pull his daggers out and turn around and look at the rest of the group  keyleth turns around and snarls at the rest of the group this twisted grin  liam whispering they call me count chocula  laughter  matt thorbir youre up  wil i am going to make a goading attack to try and draw whoevers closer  matt closest to you would be keyleth keyleth is right next to you  marisha i dont even know what to do  wil yeah so im just going to 
none	 make a goading attack and if i hit then they come after me or  she comes after me im pretty sure i dont hit i dont know why im rolling sorry thats a four  on my first roll  liam use this one its quicker  wil laughs oh 14 im sorry i cant remember oh plus ten 24  matt 24 versus keyleth whats your armor class  marisha 17  matt 17 that hits keyleth  wil sorry about this  marisha its okay just keep me alive cashew  wil can i pull the attack 
none	 to not do as much damage i mean other than the way i usually roll  dice can i hit her with like the blunt side of the axe  matt you can say subdual damage itll still damage her  wil okay should i roll my regular attack dice  matt yeah your regular attack dice  wil 15 points of damage  matt 15 points of damage to you keyleth as you get smacked broadside with the blunt edge of  thorbirs axe you see this happening and in your head youre screaming trying to push this out 
dung	  but no matter how hard your will imposes itself your body is not your own you feel like youre  restrained in a dark closet watching from a distant hallway as  somebody else controls your body  wil so i have to expend a superiority die and i add this yeah oh fuck you now youre going to  work so thats nine more points sorry  matt nine more points of damage on top of that  wil and then the target needs to make a wisdom saving throw  matt all right i will make that 
none	 the ghost creature that is a 16  wil yeah  matt whats the dc on it  wil i dont know it doesnt say  matt is this for your battlemaster for goading attack  wil yeah  matt goading attack with battlemaster  wil sorry nerds i dont play this version  liam would it be his wisdom  wil my wisdom saving throw is two my wisdom is plus two  matt okay oh the dc is eight plus your proficiency bonus which would be 12 plus your  whats your strength modifier  wil four  
none	 matt four so thatd be 16 16 so yeah it just makes the saving throw  wil oh well glad i wounded my friend for no good reason okay  marisha it makes its saving throw  wil so it makes its saving throw so nothing happens  matt right so that was your first two strikes  marisha so he just punched me for no reason  wil yeah im not going to make my third attack i dont want to hurt anybody  matt vax you dont get a turn you are unable to control your body and 
none	 you also do not get a  saving throw you are considered possessed kash youre up  will i dont know if this is possible can i use banishment and target one of the ghosts thats  actually possessing them  matt you have no way of knowing how to target the creature there is no visual or physical form you  just see your friend with a glazedover look in the eyes and that cold sensation around them you  have some experience with undead and you know you have some tools against them but banishment is  something 
none	 that you have no way of targeting the spirit within them you would have to target them  physically  will i think what you said was right we might have to knock them out so maybe we target one at  a time i hold vax and you come in  marisha i have 13 hit points  orion yeah you should definitely  will should do that okay yeah im going to cast hold person and im going to hold vax as tight as  i can  matt all right whats the spell dc for you  
none	 will it is 16  matt and is that wisdom saving throw on that  will is that right  matt lets see hold person wisdom all right go ahead and make a will saving throw vax or  wisdom saving throw  marisha fail it something ill never say to you  liam 17  matt 17  marisha whats his dc whats your dc or is it versus his wisdom  will 16  matt 16 defeats it the spell effect shimmers off  liam right now me and ghost in my mind are doing that scene from 
none	 ghost with the pottery  will and my spell just cant get to you damn it  matt all right so that finishes your turn do you want to move anywhere or are you going to  stay where you are  will yeah i think im going to have to tuck tail and run lets try to split them up at least if  we can  matt okay which way do you want to go  will really you want to get them together then lets do that all right fair enough lets get  them together  
none	 orion over here kashaw  will yeah lets move i want to go with stormdragon  matt as you move back keyleth you get an attack of opportunity on him go ahead and roll an attack  with your staff  marisha sorry cashew ooh critical fail i dont want to  will i think she might like me  matt as there is the mental struggle going on in keyleths mind this swing has extreme intensity  and then halfway through just streaks off and slams into the stone wall part of the staff splinters  and breaks at 
none	 the edge its still functional but definitely took a hit from the wall  marisha my favorite staff  matt all right that ends your turn keyleth you lose your turn up at the top of the round  tiberius  marisha can we not try and save from it we cant do shit were just on autopilot at this point  matt does anyone here at the top of this round want to make a religion check does anyone here  want to make a religion check  will might as well right  matt yeah youve had some 
none	 experience with death and undeath in your history  orion 20  matt 20 not you  will so plus seven its a six no it was nine 16  matt 16 okay youve heard of certain creatures ghosts that can possess certain entities when a  creature is possessed you know from your experience that it is very difficult to remove the  possession unless its through some sort of a ritual that forces undead away or if the actual  person is brought to unconsciousness and near death themself tiberius you have the same visual  on this 
none	 though a little part of your brain says wait youve seen pike do something that scared  undead before top of the round brings us to tiberius  orion i take no pleasure in this i cast obelisk of stone and crush them  marisha crush who  orion both of them  matt you dont have visual on vax currently theres a wall  orion ill move forward and then do it  matt okay you move up to there and do it  orion or as close as i can as far away as i can see vax 
none	  matt cool so currently these two stone pillars slam and crush both of you towards the ceiling  liam no tiberius   matt well its a dexterity saving throw right so both of you make a dexterity saving throw  liam i rolled 22  marisha its not going to be good yeah i rolled an 18  matt so take half damage  orion no they take the damage theyre not pinned they just take the damage  matt so they both take the damage  marisha probably unconscious  orion 31 points of damage  marisha 
none	 im unconscious  matt keyleth you fall unconscious on the ground forcing the spiritual entity out of your body  orion im going to spend two sorcery points to quicken a spell and then cast scorching ray right  at it fire blasts  matt okay go for it so go ahead and roll for the attack on each of them since it was forced  out it is not in melee with you because it is far enough away so you straight roll for these  orion what is that oh plus my spell attack okay so 16 was 
none	 one 19 and 19  matt all hit go ahead and roll damage for each just give me a total damage  orion two four six  liam rock that math come on  orion okay thats ten and 15 and then 18 23  matt 23 okay you release all three scorching rays blasting into the ghost its impacting but  the bursts seem to detonate through it you can see its taking the hits but it seems almost like  because of its ethereal form its not feeling the full brunt of the attacks its affected by it 
none	  and you can see its form being shuddered around by it but its not as effective as youre used to  them being that ends your turn tiberius this creature here okay it does not regain its  possession ability it is going to use horrifying visage all of a sudden the ghost roars  ghostbusters style it grows and its just a horrible screaming entity i need all of you  except for vax to go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw  orion thats negative thats 16  matt 16  wil 13  will 12 
none	  matt 12 all of you guys manage to shrug off the effect you however theres something about the  way it screamed that for a moment you swear it had a face similar to vesh from your wedding  night it clutches your heart and you are considered frightened for the next minute that  means you cannot move closer to it and your attacks against it are at a disadvantage until you  shrug it off all right then the possessed vax is going to as his bonus action attempt to make a  stealth check and back 
none	 out of the way goes against the wall if i could have thorbir and  tiberius make perception checks  liam dont i make a stealth check  matt im making it for you  wil oh look at that  liam he got 19  marisha oh my god  wil all right 24  matt 24 nice  orion i failed  matt you failed okay you see out of the corner of your eye a couple of footsteps as vax comes  rushing up you do not see it though and as vax turns the corner right 
none	 here brings out the  daggers and goes towards tiberius out of the corner of your eye you see a flash of light  actually no you make the attack roll on this attack roll against tiberius  liam oh yeah  matt okay  orion wait he has to roll at disadvantage cloak  matt right but he has advantage on you because you didnt see him so it cancels it out  liam thats true yeah my cloak gives you disadvantage  matt all right so go ahead and roll with sneak attack damage against tiberius  liam 
none	 okay that is a nine plus five ten 22 24 thats 33  matt 33 points of piercing damage against you  orion whats half of that  matt no stoneskin youve already cast a concentration spell right but when you cast one  the other one lasts for two more rounds and you started with true strike  marisha its also been way over a minute  orion its an hourlong spell i can still hold another one and do a different one and hold the  other spell  matt how it works is whenever you cast a 
none	 new concentration spell the other one lasts for two  rounds and then vanishes i think this should be the last round that you have it because its been  two rounds since you moved back so this would be the last round that you have it so you still have  it but it fades after this round so halve that  orion thats 16 17 points  matt actually and stoneskin only works against nonmagical so no you take full damage because  his daggers are magic  orion both daggers are magical  matt all of his 
none	 daggers are magical  marisha yeah were only rolling with magical weapons at this point yo  matt so you take full damage  orion okay cool thats actually great to know im actually happy about that  matt and you do not have your bonus action because you used that to hide so thats the one  attack you got that rounds over  liam theres no save or anything  matt not for this not until someone somehow forces the undead entity out of your body or drops  you to zero hit points  liam lets go 
tavern	 to the bar  matt all right that brings us to thorbir  wil sighs if i see this correctly theres this spectral creature in front of me and my possessed  friend to my left is that right  matt correct actually keyleth make a saving throw  marisha im unconscious oh right because im unconscious seven  matt mark off a death saving throw thorbir  wil okay thorbir is going to im sorry 16  matt total of 16  wil yeah total of 16  liam 17  matt 17 whiffs hes too fast he ducks 
none	 underneath the depth of the axe swing  wil okay second attack 18  matt 18 will hit go ahead and roll damage on that  wil and i want to do that same thing  matt goading attack okay  wil sorry no those are 20siders im like how did i roll a 19 on a d12 15 plus six 21  matt are you rolling 2d12 for damage on that  wil yeah my damage is 2d12 plus six slashing damage  matt for a great axe i think it should be 1d12 im pretty sure  wil 
none	 im happy to make it 1d12  matt laughs just as a note yeah the great axe is 1d12 damage  wil oh well i dont know why it says 2d12 then  matt thats okay  wil all right so thats ten  matt so ten damage to you goading attack it failed its saving throw it rolled an 11  it failed its saving throw as you slam you can see the spiritual anger in the eyes growls  turn towards you and its focused on you at the moment  wil and im going to make my 
none	 third attack so everyone knows that things have gotten back to  normal  will the world is right again  wil everythings fine  matt the third strike you swing and you swear its going right for the torso of vax and for a  second you almost want to restrain because youre afraid of what its going to do before all of a  sudden both daggers catch the axe in midair and scissorhold it before it shoves off the blade however it does  appear to be focused on you does that end your turn  wil 
none	 oh im sorry im supposed to expend another superiority die im sorry this is a whole new  mechanic  matt thats okay its a new mechanic for me too  wil okay so i add one more to my damage roll and that was it that was the only attack that  landed  matt all right that brings us to brother kash  will who still cant move correct  matt you cant move closer  will well what id like to do is if i know im going to be rolling everything essentially at a  disadvantage 
none	 id like to at least help the people that are still standing as much as i can so id  like to bless stormwind and thorbir and can i do myself as well its up to three creatures  matt then yes you can  will and myself as well  matt okay so you are all currently affected by a bless spell what a bless spell does if you want  to read it real fast  will bless up to three creatures of your choice within range whenever a target makes an attack  roll or a saving 
none	 throw before the spell ends the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to  the attack roll or saving throw  liam its hard to accept love from others when you hate yourself  wil no one hates themselves as much as i do  matt all right so do you want to move  will i can only move back and forth right then let me stay there so i can concentrate as much as  i can on holding the blessing  marisha an attack roll or saving throw  matt yes  marisha 
none	 can he target me and would it work for my saving throws  matt i think you have to be a conscious creature for the bless spell to affect you you do  however get your saving throw at the end of your turn to try to shrug off the fright so roll that  and you can add a d4 to it  will so its a d20 plus a four  matt yeah with your wisdom and then add a d4 to it  will 19 was that right and wait its for wisdom  matt yes  
none	 will so its 19 then plus where is wisdom plus nine so 28  matt okay yeah  will plus d4 right  matt plus d4 if you want to add it go for it  will one 29  matt you slam your foot into the ground for a second and focus and for a second the divine  energy pulses through your body and you let a little bit of veshs essence seep into you  against your better judgment it gives you that sense of bravery to shrug off the fear you felt  and for a 
none	 second there youre like as a healing cleric undead should be afraid of you and you  remember that theres an ability that you have called turn undead that may come in handy going  forward that ends your turn keyleth make another saving throw  marisha sighs lets use this one this is a big shiny die 17  matt 17 okay so youre still unconscious  marisha im good  matt tiberius youre up louder tiberius youre up  orion keyleth is right next to me right  matt shes currently on the ground you can see a 
none	 little bit of blood trickling out the corner of  her mouth from the injury she sustained from the crushing pillar you can see a little of the light  fading from her eyes  orion vax is right next to me also can i move probably take a hit from him  and drag her with me  matt you can do that yeah that will be your whole turn but yeah you can do that  orion thats what i choose to do  matt okay so tiberius you reach down you grab keyleths body and you pull 
none	 her back through the  hallway you can get her probably about halfspeed which is 30 so 15 feet that far  back out of the fray go ahead and make an attack of opportunity against tiberius as he moves away  liam okay thats shit i rolled a 12  matt total of 12 okay as you swing back you dodge out of the way as youre pulling her along  the floor thats your turn this ghost entity here does not get its possession back its going  to make a withering touch against you thorbir  wil 
none	 damn it  matt with a 13  wil against my  matt yeah  wil no 20  matt as you reach out you manage to pull back with your axe and swing in its direction it  dissipates its form for a second and the attack whiffs through the air however as you pull on  that side vax comes up from behind you i want you to go ahead and do two attacks against  thorbir with advantage  liam with advantage on both attacks or one  matt you currently have him flanked  liam because 
none	 of my ghost friend  matt yes  liam so the first is high  matt that hits  liam 28 second is a one  matt and another roll they both have advantage because you have him flanked  liam come on one mutters 19  matt okay so roll damage for both first one with sneak attack  liam doesnt he have an armor class of 20 doesnt one of them miss wouldnt a 19 miss his  20 armor  matt it was a total 19 i thought you rolled a 19  liam no one was 
none	 a total 19  matt oh then the second one doesnt hit just the first one does  liam so the first one does and that is okay thats the lowest this could possibly be seven  plus nine 12 16 17 24  wil ouch thats a lot of damage  matt all right that ends the ghosts turn thorbir youre up youve now got the attention  of both spiritual entities and your possessed friend and theyre both swarming around you at  the moment  wil okay great i have this deal chuckles im sorry i dont 
none	 remember what its called i have a  maneuver where if i hit a thing i can hit a second thing lets just see if i hit im going  to go ahead and try to hit vax again  matt okay  wil two is probably not going to hit him probably not going to happen im thinking twos  probably not going to be its a total of 12 but im still pretty confident that 12 doesnt hit  him yeah im pretty sure that misses okay lets try again i get three attacks thats  right lets 
none	 see here oh a four okay so four lets see so thats 14 so im thinking the 14 is  probably not going to hit him all right lets try one more time come on right and oh thats  a seven so thats a 17  liam tag  wil oh  matt you find purchase with your third strike with your axe  wil i just need time to warm up im thinking about my daughter so i guess i hit you  liam i dont like this game i dont really like this episode  wil i 
none	 make a precision attack so i can add one more die to the roll  liam come on clock me war and peace lets do this  wil im working on it  marisha war and peace  wil oh good so thats a one on the d12 plus six seven plus nine is 16  matt 16 points of slashing damage to you  liam okay  matt do you wish to move or are you going to stay where you are thorbir  wil i would like to no longer be flanked by them if thats at all 
none	 possible  so i will move back sure  matt ill say you can move there pretty safely move the other way all right that brings us to  kashaw  will okay im going to channel divinity turn undead  matt turn undead okay whats the radius on that  will 30 feet  matt 30 feet youre probably going to have to move a little closer to get them both in there  will i want to get as close as i can right on the 30foot radius  matt all right not a problem so youre going 
none	 to go ahead and turn undead as you reach up and grab  your holy symbol pulling it out from under your armor once again clutching it tightly you can  feel the blood begin to pour from the inside of your hand youre holding it so hard and with a  flash of extremely vibrant white light with this strange halo of pitch black that surrounds it a  force wave billows out from you throughout the hallway for a brief moment you see vax look  over and his eyes widen for a second as the blast wave 
none	 hits him  will youre stronger than that  liam you have a fan  will i just think it would be funny hit pedals like a guitar you can just change your thing  fan rain  matt both fail all right so suddenly as the blast wave hits vax the spirit is forced out of  his body against the wall it pushes it out and all of a sudden you have control of your form  again blown against the wall and they both halfway slide into the wall they both have a  severe look of 
none	 fear on their face thats going to end your turn keyleth  make another saving throw  marisha eight  matt so a second failed death saving throw  marisha someone pump some life into me  matt tiberius  orion yeah im going to pop one of my simple potions  matt okay just the level one  orion yeah  matt all right go ahead and roll that is 2d4 plus two  orion okay thats seven  matt seven okay you heal seven hit points you come to consciousness  marisha gasps  matt you get rid 
none	 of the saving throws you look around your eyes focus and you can see now  theres these two glowing entities the ghosts that attacked the one that was inside you is now  over against the wall and looks like its dissipating and is extremely frightened by  something  orion can i use the rest of my turn to help her up  matt sure you go ahead and prop her up to her feet  orion all right and thats my turn  matt okay for their turn they both fade into the wall and vanish from 
none	 sight  marisha they were so cold  matt so all of you take a moment of stillness as the spiritual entities seem to have vanished into  the wall  marisha oh they left  matt they left after he blasted them with his shockwave of positive energy they just went into  the wall  marisha you scared them with positive energy  will unfortunately the only kind of energy im allowed to use most of the time  liam you told me when i pickpocketed that guy topside it was a healing potion it was blue  
none	 right thats what you told me  matt yeah  liam im pulling that out of my pocket and walking over to that door in a daze and i just  down it push the door open with my foot  matt okay that is a greater healing potion 4d4 plus four  orion and marisha are you moving forward  liam no well yeah sort of  orion vex no stop what are you doing  liam my name is vax and i keep going  orion thats what i said  matt okay you kick the door open 
none	 you have very little light source in here but with your vision  you manage to look in past there and it looks like its a hallway that was once used for storage  of some kind but the first thing that catches you is that strange chemical smell is extremely strong  in this room and your eyes burn as soon as the doorway opens and you have to close your eyes  thorbir you see vax kick the door open  marisha wait vax slow down  wil i follow him  marisha you guys  orion i 
none	 do not follow  matt you do not follow okay tiberius stays back you guys are all staying there  will id like to call everyone together if i could first lets take a moment  liam im just looking i take another potion because i have one more and im going to look  down the hall  wil wait friend i give him a potion of superior healing  will you know im a healer right you can save your potions  liam save it whats that superior is a 4d4  matt superiors another 4d4 yeah you 
none	 guys can take a short rest if you wish to and also use  your hit dice  marisha can i get some healing will you use some of that positive energy on me  will of course i will  orion i will go no further until i take a proper rest  liam im just going to look down that hall  matt okay both of you guys as you enter the room and your darkvision looks out you see the  room that has that strong chemical scent parts of the wall have crumbled in sections ruining 
none	 this  long empty hallway you can see there are elements of broken boxes and crates that have been  sundered or removed or destroyed in the collapse but what catches your attention too is a large  portion of the floor seems to be lower than the rest of it there is some sort of a liquid that  has largely overtaken the entirety of this room something has seeped through from some unseen  source and has slowly over time dissolved a large pit into the center of this hallway this  dull yellowishgreen liquid now fills the 
none	 entirety of the center portion of this hallway for a good  lets say about that distance there  liam okay i put my hand on thorbirs hand and guide him back out and shut the door and say its  fucking acid in that room i just sit on the ground  wil of course it is  marisha vax  liam im back in the hall with you acidfilled room im going to rest lets all just take a  breather  marisha can we make camp im hurting really bad  will lets take a moment here 
none	  orion i agree weve been hit pretty hard pretty quickly  liam do you want to camp or do you want to take a breather  marisha just take a rest actually i have something that i think will make us all feel  better and i prepare a heroes feast  orion you have those  marisha i do now  orion what does that do  marisha ill tell you  orion are there bananas  liam its a 20footlong hoagie  marisha yes its the 20footlong subway dealio  will no not subway  liam too 
none	 soon  laughter  matt marisha just a headsup one of the material components is a gemencrusted bowl that  costs 1000 gold pieces that is consumed by it you can totally cast this but youll have to deduct a  thousand gold off your personal gold supply  will how much money have you got  marisha like 3k i think  will you have 3k you said you were single  marisha all right fine ill do it  matt all right  marisha you guys ive just had a neardeath experience ive been craving some lasagna okay 
none	  so im going to make some of the best goddamn lasagna weve ever had in our life im going to  spend a thousand dollars and make some amazing fucking lasagna  orion what are dollars  marisha a thousand gold  will whats lasagna  liam its a tribal food that her people eat its vegetarian  will if shes spending the money ill eat  matt so as you guys take a few moments to tend to your wounds and catch your breath keyleth finds a  section of the center of this dank dreary prison and 
none	 concentrates taking this gemencrusted bowl  and setting it in the center of the floor as time goes on you begin to see this strange shimmering  energy in the center of the room at the end of the ritual she raises her hand in the air and  through a plume of whitishsilver smoke that slowly dissipates you can now see there is a long  table a very wellcrafted table in the center of the room with chairs and benches and an  extremely wellprepared incrediblesmelling meal fruits and breads and meats all just strewn about  this 
none	 table in the center of this prison  marisha okay everybody close your eyes okay tiberius will you make the little forks dance for  me with mage hand  orion sure  marisha okay are you guys ready singing be our guest be our guest  put our service to the test  will is this a thing is this happening right now  marisha look im making a musical out of our food people pay a lot of money for this  liam she set it out have a seat eat the food  orion thank you keyleth 
none	  marisha i thought that was funny  liam i just start eating im wiped out  matt all right you guys can use as many hit dice as you want to heal yourself if you check on your  sheet it has a hit dice number use those to heal yourself naturally  marisha so after we eat all of this food we are cured of all diseases and poisons we become  immune to poison and being frightened and all of our wisdom saving throws have advantage also our  maximum hit points increase by 2d10  will 
none	 for how long  marisha 24 hours and you gain the same number of hit points so dont spend any of your hit dice  were going to eat our way to health  matt well no you still spend your hit dice meaning you gain 2d10 hit points  marisha and it gains the same number of hit points oh  matt so you increase the maximum and you heal up what you gained  marisha okay i see what it means  will so how do you heal yourself then  matt where it says hit dice on 
none	 your page it should be toward the middle right above your  attacks  will yeah  matt you can spend up to your top level and you roll a dice with the number you have for your hit  dice and you heal that much so whats the number that you have there  will total is 11 1d8 plus three  matt so you can spend up to 11 if you want to and heal up that much naturally  will but i wasnt taking any damage thats the thing  matt then you dont have to worry 
none	 about it youre fine  marisha why did you burn all of your sorcerer points we told you not to burn all of your  sorcerer points we dont have time to sit here and take a full rest  will i can still cure everybody you know i can heal everybody the wounds  matt use your hit dice to heal yourself you commence on the meal and  it is a very delightful meal  marisha you can ask the group but i have a feeling that vax and thorbir arent going to want  to take a

none	 you look inside you walk up to the liquid it looks like there is a very slow flow to  it coming at an angle its very thick and looks like its melted through the basis of the floor  and almost like it would continue under around and out of this room into whatever is beyond you  get a feeling there is something to why this part of the prison was probably abandoned  liam wait a tic wait a sec i back out slowly and im going to creep back to the other door  that other

none	 about this how did you hear about this  wil he was a good man who was murdered by the gods  orion it is legend  will the acid guy is legend all right  wil i go walking down the hallway this way  matt okay keyleth what are you doing youre meditating  marisha let me wait until he opens this door  matt okay  wil ill make a perception check at that door  matt go for it  wil 11  matt all right the door does not appear to be trapped you dont 
none	 know if its locked yet its  hard to tell  liam just allow me youre strong  wil thats what they say  liam thats 27  matt it is also from your perspective not locked or trapped  marisha okay now im going to drop to my knees and cast locate creature  matt okay as youre finishing your small ritual for locate creature you open up the door and it  is a spiral staircase that leads upward you get the sensation this is where those earlier bastions  were coming from  will no acid  
none	 matt no acid in this room no  marisha just a staircase up  matt you finish locate creature and you sit there and you can sense grasping on that one  encounter you had with the rakshasa though it was still disguised as a dwarf and the descriptor you  have and you recognize this immediately this is the same type of ritual that you did earlier and  so theres now this weird synchronous moment that you share magical knowledge  will and she has money  matt and she has money though a thousand less now you 
none	 finish your concentration for a second  and the divine energy pulls you in a direction and it pulls you in the direction of this way  marisha im sorry i think were going to need to go through the acid  wil very well  liam my armor is resistant to acid let me lead the way is there any shit sitting around any  rubbish  matt there are clumps of what looks like a destroyed crate pieces of stone that have fallen  from the partially collapsed walls  liam im going to pull up a plank 
none	 of that crate  orion as hes doing this i cast fly on thorbir keyleth the cleric and vax and myself  matt you can only cast it on three people  orion i can cast it at 6th level  matt 6th level its one additional person per spell level  orion im terrible at math not vax  wil with your math and my rolling we are a formidable team  orion us four  matt all right its a 3rdlevel spell so you can do four okay so against who  liam everyone but me  matt 
none	 everyone but you okay so  marisha oh wait we brought the flying carpet with us its in your bag of holding  will you have a flying carpet  orion oh yes  liam well theres that  will that would be helpful to fly over things like pools of acid  marisha why dont we pull that out  will yeah thats a good idea  matt as youre pulling out the flying carpet were going to go ahead and take a break quick  restroom break for about five minutes or so and well come right back 
none	 to continue as they enter  the room with a rather large pit of acid well be back in five minutes guys see you in a second  marisha acid pit  break  matt welcome back guys before we get back to the game orion you want to talk  about that video  orion yeah that disney princess shit you saw was lewberger and theyre playing tomorrow at gather  your party on this channel and i will be performing songs with alex lewis whos half of  lewberger and i get to call zac a dumdum for

none	 viscous liquid you have pulled out the flying carpet  marisha yes we all fit on it right  orion oh yeah we can all get on this one  liam do you maybe want to sparrow across keyleth  marisha oh we took a short rest i could  liam then i get to come  wil whats happening  matt and marisha we have flying carpets  matt built by some of our amazing critters im going to go ahead and go with the crocheted one  tonight  wil thats fantastic  will crocheting is fantastic and 
none	 a wonderful way to spend your time  wil you guys have the best fans  matt we really do  liam you guys are pretty great  marisha okay we all fit were good  liam oh we all fit on it oh look at that  marisha lets go  matt all right  marisha onward  matt you drift down the hallway on the flying carpet  liam staring at the slime on the ground  matt the air itself like i said it hurts you have to continuously rub your eyes  and keep them shut 
none	  marisha i make a nice little wind zephyr to give us a little airflow  matt okay as you move partway through this section everyone make a perception check  orion oh natural 20  will nice  will 19  marisha 19  matt whos helming the magic carpet by the way  liam looks like kash is  orion i am helming the damn magic carpet of course  matt all right so youre helming the magic carpet  wil i rolled a six plus a 12 total 12  matt and you rolled a total of 
none	 what  orion natural 20  matt natural 20  liam 26  matt so pulling forward as you come around through the sections of the wall that are  collapsed in rubble you notice that there are some sigils in the wall twofoothigh  carvedstone sigils about five feet ahead of you guys theres one on each side  orion are they infernal  matt it is not infernal they are arcane in nature though make an arcana check  liam sometimes i really hate this oldworld shit  will can i do a religion check on them  
none	 matt you can yes  orion i got ten so i figured  will 15  matt okay there doesnt appear to be much religious connotation to these symbols but  theyre old and it looks like they were placed there for a specific reason thats as much as you  can get from it  liam can i make out any traps or anything in the ceilings or the walls  matt you can make a perception check tiberius points it out to the rest of you guys and you can  see it  liam but nothing in 
none	 addition to that  matt no especially for you your experience doesnt fall too much in the realm of the arcane  marisha could i do a history check  matt you can try  marisha why not  liam how about handle animals man  matt try every skill just go through the whole list  marisha 12  matt yeah theres nothing really historic about this other than the fact that youre in the  historic amaranthine oubliette prison here  wil did anyone make an arcana check and we didnt find anything out is this something that 
none	  my stonecunning skills would be relevant to  matt its not structural in looking at it it looks like these were added to it once it was  built although it is a storage room so its strange that these would be placed in the center  of the room  wil would i make an insight check perhaps no that doesnt apply  matt insights more for individuals and motives  marisha wisdom saving throws continue  wil i just dont want to be over this acid anymore  matt okay so you push forward  liam its 
none	 going to be all right  wil thats what my friend thought  matt you push forward you get about here as youre passing through the two sigils and theres  a flash from the sigils they glow bright and its almost like two flashbulbs go off from side  to side you stop the carpet dips as in the carpet goes limp  orion i cast fly on all of us  matt okay as the carpet goes limp you all begin to plummet forward you need to go ahead and make  a concentration check  marisha oh 
none	 my god  matt its with your constitution modifier  orion 16  matt 16 okay so you cast fly multiple times people begin to lift up and then the spell fades  there is something about these sigils that is cancelling magic however the carpet is now going  limp and all of you are now plummeting down towards the acidic surface below your action was  casting fly there is one piece of open ground here that can fit maybe two people  wil thorbir dives for it  matt okay  marisha can i cast wall of 
none	 stone and make a big stone underneath of us to support the carpet  matt go ahead and roll a concentration check  marisha lets use this one add my what  matt constitution saving throw essentially is what it is  marisha constitution saving throw why  matt this is to maintain your concentration as youre falling  marisha 13  matt yeah unfortunately due to the jostling youre unable to get the spell out in time  thorbir who else is jumping for the platform  marisha i go eagle  matt okay you go eagle form keyleth 
none	 catches herself before plummeting inside and goes giant  eagle form gliding past without an issue tiberius is falling i want you guys tiberius  thorbir vax and kash to all make dexterity saving throws  liam tell me how i would go about doing this as i fall with the carpet i want to try to pull up  on the carpet and land in the shit  matt okay make an acrobatics check  liam 27  matt 27 all right what was your dex  wil 14  matt 14  orion 17  matt 17  
none	 will 12  matt 12 so thorbir and tiberius make it onto that small platform and barely catch yourself  before plummeting into the liquid however brother kash you splash and its about  waistdeep from where you impact sizzling immediately you feel this horrible corrosive  burning sensation you grabbing the carpet lift and drift and come down into the section this  section has eroded more and you are about to go up to your shoulders immediately the two of you  suffer 18 points of acid damage  liam im wearing acidresistant armor  matt so you 
none	 take nine points instead  marisha can i fly and pick up brother kash as an eagle and try and fly and drag him to the shore  orion dont worry about him is he a gnome  marisha no hes a human  orion get the carpet from him instead  matt youre barely catching yourself shes over the other way right now you however are  submerged in the liquid now  liam am i under  matt youre having to tread you are now underneath yep you are completely submerged  liam is the carpet with me 
none	  matt carpet is with you  liam under the acid  matt it is currently sizzling in the acid  liam well that did not work  will laughs no  marisha wait carpets in the acid  matt with him yes you guys are still on the edge there you reach over and grab him  marisha grab the carpet grab the carpet with you kash  will grunts he reaches out and grabs the carpet even though its sizzling  matt the carpet takes 16 points of acid damage as youre taking your turn to pull it 
none	 out as opposed  to trying to escape from that point you take another 15 points of acid damage until eventually  youre pulled out from the entire pool and carried over to the other side and then dropped on the  other side both of you guys pulling the carpet out the carpet itself its color has dampened  portions of the corners of the carpet have dissolved and you can see the liquid on it is  still eating away at the actual fibers of the carpet youre still submerged you take another  18 points of acid 
none	 damage reduced to nine again same as you took last time  and what are you doing  liam me im trying to climb up onto the rock that is right there that i didnt jump onto  matt right here theres only enough room for two people  liam whos on it now  matt currently tiberius and thorbir  liam well i guess im swimming through acid then  matt you can try and get on there but youd probably push somebody else off  liam no im just going to start wading towards the other side  
none	 matt okay athletics roll it is a very thick gloopy liquid  liam thats all right because i rolled a 19 so that is a total of 21  matt 21 thatll be enough to get you just towards the edge and you grunts pull yourself  out onto the side of the stonework taking a final 13 points of acid damage halved because of your  armor you take seven pants on the side both you and kashaw are catching yourself wiping it  off the parts of the flesh you can see theres scarring on your skin from 
none	 where the liquid began  to dissolve some of the flesh on the outer layers the carpet itself is still sizzling the edges  of it are starting to burn away and dissolve  marisha can you prestidigitation that shit off  matt hes across the way right now currently on the small platform with thorbir what are you guys  doing right now  wil i want to look at the walls and see if theres handholds or some other way that i can  try to go across the wall you know god of war style  matt 
none	 looking at it there are parts of the walls that have slowly become pockmarked from the  proximity of this caustic vitriol theyre few and far between you can attempt to do a leap  parkourstyle but that would be a pretty hefty feat of acrobatics to do so  wil well as you may know acrobatics is something we heavy plate mailwearing dwarves are  extraordinarily good at is she still an eagle eagle hey eagle  marisha caws  matt swoop over  liam and marisha screech  matt you grab thorbir  marisha actually eagles sound like 
none	 shit they use a raptor or something like that eagles dont  actually sound like that eagles are actually like weak squawk  matt they use an actual raptor sound they record from the wild to dub the eagle  will they carry tiny little microphone things right here  matt yeah they have to construct eagle noises in post  wil its all part of the great eagle conspiracy  will its all foley everything with an eagle frank welker is the sound of every eagle thats  ever been out there  laughter  liam i saw this 
none	 great documentary about it on youtube  matt giraffes foxes eagles  will its all frank welker  wil every other animal dee bradley baker  all dee bradley baker  laughter  matt so are you grabbing tiberius or thorbir  marisha tiberius caws sorry hes more important caws  orion ill take out my mending wheel when i land and grab the carpet  marisha fix that shit  matt okay  marisha and then i go back for thorbir  matt okay you take thorbir and lift him back over magic carpet has sustained fairly hefty  
none	 damage and currently the way youre reading it its enchantment is fading  marisha hurry quick come on tiberius  orion what im fixing it im using the mending wheel  matt okay you take the mending wheel and you set it up  marisha maybe get the acid off it first  orion i prestidigitate it off first there  will how are you doing  liam i can walk i can fight im not as pretty  will lets heal  marisha and remember if everyone rolled 2d12 you get that added to your maximum hit points  
none	 from your meal  wil thorbir is pushing himself back as far away from the acid as he can possibly get he doesnt  care how ridiculous he looks  matt okay as youre keeping yourself at the back you can see its all flowing in this  direction slowly it looks like theres a section of the wall here thats somewhat open and you can  see theres a pathway where its flowing through this direction and its coasting and flowing out  underneath the wall on this side so youre keeping a close eye on that youve finished 
dung	  assembling the mending wheel you take the flying carpet and set it on there the wheel begins to  rotate and as it does the carpet curls up almost like heat to a hair curls up on its own  and begins to formulate this small cluster of material you can see where a lot of its vibrant  color is gone and left with dark charred and partially eatenaway cloth and cotton im going  to ask you to make an arcana check to attempt to use your concentration and knowledge of magic  enchantment to maintain it 
none	  orion 18  matt 18 vs the damage dealt okay as the wheel spins and spins you can see as the color is  fading and fading and fading the spark of enchantment sputters and sputters and then the  threads of the flying carpet begin to reattach and reform and areas where the damage to the carpet  begin to ravel back out into a fully functional formed carpet the mending wheel eventually comes  to a stop the spokes of it collapse inward and the carpet unfurls a solid seemingly untouched  piece of material a mundane 
none	 carpet  wil well that could have gone better  will it was a nice carpet  orion it was a waste of fucking time lets press on  will id like to mass cure wounds first  matt okay  marisha fuck  liam vex is going to kill us  marisha yeah  will who is that  liam my sister  marisha oh god we just heard them scream from the other room oh my god  liam on a delay they just saw it  marisha yeah they did were sorry  liam the other half 
none	 of the party saw it die 20 seconds after it happened and we heard them  scream from out there  marisha why are you being so poopy today tiberius  orion im cranky because i havent slept thats why  liam can we just take a moment for the carpet please weve had a lot of good times  with that carpet  orion yeah too bad right  marisha weve had a lot of good times  will youve had that carpet for a while  liam we found clarota on that carpet never mind lets not talk 
none	 about that sighs  marisha fuck  wil thorbir has no attachment to this carpet im looking for exits  matt okay go ahead and make a perception check  orion nor does tiberius  liam well i do and my sisters going to kill me specifically  marisha vex is going to be so angry  orion this is a death march  wil 15  marisha i give vax a hug  will are we curing the wounds too  matt yes whats the total amount of cure mass cure wounds  will i want to cast on 
none	 everybody if i can  matt i would say mass cure wounds as a tactical standpoint is a better thing to save for combat  because its a thing you can do one round and you can heal everybody  will oh okay  matt so youd more want to spend your level1 spells and cure people as you go  will yeah i think id like to do that id like to at least cure myself with  my level1 cure then  matt okay go for it looking at this area the wall is solid stone there is 
none	 no apparent exit  you take a while and inspect the wall but it just seems to be solid walls either the exit may have  been part of the collapsed wall or there is no exit to this room  will equal to 1d8 plus my spellcasting ability  wil i cant seem to find a way out of here  liam groans sorry  wil maybe your skills could be useful theres time to mourn the dead and the carpet  marisha its like a member of our family man  liam got an 18 on perception  
none	 matt 18 on perception  liam so were at a dead end on the other side of this shit  wil i certainly hope not  matt looking around the wall you can see theres a section where you both look over on the far end  in the corner and there is a small panel of stone that seems to have a slight mismatch in the  texture of the rest of the wall as you both look at the wall you see it and you take that cue  and walk up and shove the plate at the 
none	 side and it stone scraping glides to the side slightly and  there is a small three foot by three foot entryway that exits this side of the room  marisha we almost lost the carpet that one time too and we found it  will shes still talking about the carpet  marisha im sorry  will i was literally just swimming in acid  liam look tiberius it has sentimental value well put it in greyskull keep  just put it in the bag  marisha we can hang it up like a tapestry that would be nice 
dung	  orion no we can make it fly again  matt as you guys are having this conversation thorbir has disappeared through a small pathway  that he and vax both found  liam folks were moving and i follow him  matt you step through a 15foot corridor that immediately opens into another room that has a  small lower foyer area and a slight step up into a large contained room this room is not as dark as  everything else youve gone through as far as light source this room has a very faint series of  
none	 braziers along the walls they have almost a slight ember torchlight lighting the vicinity  looking inside you can immediately see what looks to be another small stream of that same acidic  vitriol that is slowly pouring across the floor and this appears to be the source that you saw  before that has been trickling through and is eating into the side of the wall immediately to your  left along the walls there are sets of armor of varying size theyre set up as ornamental pieces  in the center of the room there is a tenfoottall 
dung	 stone statue that stands before you  humanoid male with slicked long hair that goes to about midback you see fine robes that look  beautifully carved out of this dark gray stone the face is very chiseled and handsome but  at the top of the forehead you see these two hooked horns that continue upward there is not  two legs but one singular cloven hoof at the bottom of its torso as it stands and you can see  from the eyes the source of the green acidic liquid that drips down like tears pools on the 
none	  ground and spills out of the room  will well thats not good  marisha kashaw does this mean anything to you  matt you guys are entering after  will yes  wil i step away from the acid to my left  will can i do a religion check on the statue  matt you may very much so  will 18  matt 18 you recognize very clearly from your religious studies and your travels this is  dispater who is one of the archdevils of the second layer of hell also known as the iron 
none	 duke  and is considered a master of politics and manipulation  will the iron duke  liam im going stealth now  matt roll stealth  marisha master of politicians and deception  matt politics and deception  orion i cast greater invisibility  matt all righty i will say its at this point that as you all assembled you hear a voice echo  through the room it starts off as this low simmering growl growls i ask you all this  question why do you hunt hotis why do you come seeking me dead so fervently that 
none	 you would  continue past such terrible losses and dangers looking around the room you see no source of the  voice that seems to be either omnipresent or loud enough that the echoing of the walls doesnt give  away any location  orion our hand is forced we are bound by contract i do not personally wish to be here  matt what if i could tell you this contract you are bound to there are ways of getting around  such magics  wil why should we trust someone who chooses not to reveal itself  matt 
none	 why should you trust someone that with very little reason sent you to your death beneath a prison  cell to die a pit of acid  will were not dead yet  matt yet  orion what is this offer that you speak of  matt you could try and kill me and you may very well destroy me but ill be back or we could  choose to make a deal perhaps a separate contract equally binding but nowhere near as  dangerous as this one and i would say as part of this deal perhaps we could 
town	 do some business down  the road youve already walked into my place of business and disturbed my customers and briefly  nearly ended my business venture for the time being this is a very angering thing for one who  spends a very long time building these ventures and i have plans i have plots looking at the  both of you i can see that perhaps you are not bound by the moralities that such silly folks in  vasselheim seem to cling to am i incorrect  marisha why dont you come out and speak to us 
none	 face to face hosier or hosien  matt hotis  marisha ah so your real name is hotis  orion if that is your real name  matt chuckles it is the name you know that is all that is required but i think you know as well  as i do for my safety i will remain unseen just as your friend has now will you let me leave we  can have this conversation in the comfort of my own room in fact we can throw a small party i  have the means to do so youve 
none	 already proven quite skilled at combat and i would hate to think  you would throw away an opportunity for what paltry sum theyre offering you  for a temporary victory  wil thorbir steps back and blocks the door  matt okay  will does anybody trust this guy  wil no deal  orion i dont think its a bad idea  marisha he serves the god of politics and deception  will does he  marisha im assuming  orion that same guy  marisha well im assuming if hes got the statue of  will the 
none	 iron duke himself  wil id like to make an insight check and see if i can get a sense of how confident he feels  20 motherfuckers  i want to know everything about him i want to know his parents name i want to  know his social security number i want to know what his bank account balance is and i want to  know his ashley madison password  laughter  liam i want him dead i want his house burned to the ground  matt as youre all taking in this still and very creepy 
none	 omnipresence of this hotis character you  in hearing the voice it is a very trained voice this is an individual that has spent the entirety  of their life manipulating and toying with the emotions minds greed and goals of others to get  its desires itself both selfpreservation and progressive expansion of its own territory you  can tell in its voice there is a hint of fear and a very heavy coating of words that are very well  practiced and silvertongued but you gather that there is very little intent to follow through on  its 
none	 side of the bargain and everything is designed as misdirection to send whatever its  made a deal with to its eventual doom  wil it dies in this room do you hear me you die in this room  matt that is unfortunate i would like all of you to make a perception check right now  marisha oh my god  wil 13 total  marisha not bad 23  liam 22  will 19  marisha 23  orion five  matt okay both keyleth and vax looking around the room there is a little hint of 
none	 movement and  you look over at the statue itself theres a little glimmer of something shift you see what  appears to be this amulet or necklace of some kind that was resting around the statue it vanishes  marisha oh son of a bitch i want to cast faerie fire in that direction right where i see the  glimmer  matt okay first off everyone roll initiative  marisha oh shit  wil just in case anyone was worried if you thought perhaps wed slipped into some sort of odd  parallel universe where i was competent 
none	 or in any way able to do anything just to let you know that  we are in fact in the same reality i did just roll another one  will good god  liam i can fly  matt okay  orion well done  will you got us so much insight though  wil thorbir is just slow because he is processing and dealing with the rage and anger and the  memories of betrayal that he has experienced having heard these sounds come from the mouths of  others before  matt and with that 20 or 
none	 higher 15 to 20  liam 19  matt 19 all right 15 to ten  will 14  marisha 13  orion 12  matt laughs look at that all right so 14 was kash  will yes sir  matt 13 was  marisha me  matt keyleth and then tiberius all righty laughs all right top of the round you hear some footsteps  there is a brief shimmering and you see across the room a form appear in the far corner you see  immediately this humanoid figure appear long reddish robes humanoid body but the 
dung	 head itself  is this dark gray feline tigerlike entity this long pronounced feline snout big fangs dripping from  it long whiskers a sadistic grin on its face the amulet that was once adorning the statue now  around its neck where its hands are you can see the hands are actually backwards and upturned in  these nastylooking claws it continues and releases its hands in some sort of arcane form  orion rakshasa  marisha rakshasa  matt rakshasa  will a rakshasa  laughter  matt and with that tiberius  marisha so i dont get 
none	 faerie fire off on him first  matt no thats going to be on your turn there thats what the initiative roll was for i need  you to go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw  orion hold on what is he doing is he casting a spell  matt he is currently yes  orion 4thlevel counterspell  matt 4thlevel counterspell  marisha you have advantage on wisdom saving throws just throwing it out there  matt so you do that  orion no it shall not do nothing on my watch  liam to quote the 
none	 bard scanlan  marisha i love that you felt like you had to clarify  matt so he goes and finishes a charm person spell towards you you release that with your ring and  the spell dissipates from his grasp growls it growls under its breath  orion how can he see me by the way im invisible still  matt he can see you  orion bastard  marisha hes smart  matt yeah even though youre invisible he looked right at you and cast the spell you gather  that theres something about him that can see 
none	 through invisibility with that hes going to  move in that direction and at the end of that that brings us to vax  liam all right well i earlier rolled a 32 on stealth but i dont know if that means shit right  now but im clicking my boots of haste and moving along the wall  matt along the wall here  liam no im going to stay put im going to attack him im going to throw dagger dagger  dagger through the air flying blades from the shadows i have no idea he might be 
none	 able to see  me like the predator  matt okay go for it  liam he already moved right so i dont get advantage for assassinate but well see if i get  sneak attack damage thats a three so thats shit thats a nine 15  matt 15 misses  marisha dagger dagger dagger  liam that is 21  matt 21 does hit  liam that was the dagger of lifestealing  matt all right so first one spins off second one he ducks out of the way the third one hits  him in the side 
none	 of the shoulder  liam now you tell me i was hidden in the shadows and rolled a 32 does that matter with him  matt right you can roll sneak attack damage  liam yeah okay counts quietly 22 yeah 22  matt 22 damage all right it smacks into him it hits him the impact though seems to almost be  partially absorbed or shrugged off youre not entirely certain it feels like it should have hit  harder but nevertheless he took damage all righty are you going to stay put  liam im going to move 
none	 through the group directly counter to him behind the statue  matt all righty thatll end your turn now kash you are going at the same time one of the nearby  larger pieces of armor comes to life and steps forward you can now see there is a large  humanoid form that is built out of a giant breastplate with the shoulder pauldrons a helmet  and these giant stonelike fists and feet that come lunging forward portions of its body are  made of a thick leather or wood structure as it comes bursting forward impact noise 
none	  marisha whats that  matt you can hope to make a check on your turn brother kash what are you doing  will lets see how tough this guy is let me cast a quick sacred flame well first i want to move  into the room  matt okay move there further in  will yeah i want to get it to where eventually were going to try to get a semicircle around him  so closer to that area around there to get a crescent going  matt okay cool this is about as far as you 
none	 can get on this turn  will okay perfect and then lets try a quick sacred flame on him  matt against which guy  will against the new entity  matt all right go for it  will thats you right  matt yeah he gets a saving throw all right it does make its saving throw i just rolled a  natural 19 so as you release the sacred flame it seems to almost ricochet off theres some sort of  magical essence about this creatures construction that ends your turn this entity  here is going to 
none	 step forward and you can see it brings its fist up for a second theres a small  gem thats embedded in one of the stone fists and you can see its pulsing with stored energy it  puts the fist forward as the rakshasa in the background as hotis instructs it and points  forward towards you guys it puts the fist forward the gem glows red and then releases a  very familiarlooking bead of red energy  orion is that a spell do i recognize that as a spell being cast  matt it is a spell 
none	  orion counterspell  matt youve already used your reaction this turn  orion damn it  matt laughs you guys look over and see this as the red beam comes and hits the back wall and  explosion detonates in a large fireball blast that encapsulates the entire  opposite side of the room  liam im using evasion im going to hit the ground and roll  matt okay that would be a dexterity saving throw for all of you  marisha ooh yeah natural 19 19  will seven  matt seven laughs fail  orion 19 
none	  matt 19  marisha 24  matt 24  wil well i mean i know what youre thinking youre thinking oh clearly i havent touched my  die because the last time i rolled my die it had a one on it but in fact i did roll another one  matt i feel like were this close to starting the apocalypse with each one that you roll  will one small black hole is getting a little bit bigger in the universe  matt yeah somewhere deep beneath the vatican theres some monk whos running around screaming

none	 of these before but youve heard about it in passing and you feel  like there was a story once about it its referred to as a shield guardian it is linked to  whoever wears the amulet and manages to share damage should the wearer take damage  will oh thats interesting to know  matt it also slowly repairs itself over time so yes you cast slow the rakshasa appears  unaffected however the guardians movements do seem to shimmer and shake as its forcing its way  through the arcane net youve now cast around it  
none	 orion cool so now it takes a negative two penalty to its ac and its dexterity saving throws  and it cant use reactions  matt yep  orion sweet and i move as far away from everything as i can  matt okay so where are you going over here thats about as far as you can get away from  everything  orion thats what i do  matt all righty that brings us to thorbir  wil am i close enough to charge up and hit that guardian  matt you could you could probably leap over 
none	 these you could do that  wil i would like to do that  matt okay you leap across grin and bear it as you dodge over the bits of acid cringing  wil im accustomed to failure  matt and you rush up to the side with your axe and  wil im going to use an action surge so i get an additional action so that was my move right so  my additional action will be to make my attack does that mean i get to do six attacks  will thats going to be six points 
none	 go for it  wil i know right okay if im going to use a maneuver do i have to declare it ahead of time  matt i would say yes  wil this is a commanders strike  liam here we go this is science  wil 23  matt that hits yeah  wil all right this is a commanders strike when you take the attack action on your turn you  can forego one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike  when you do so choose a 
none	 friendly creature who can see you or hear you and expend a superiority die  that creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack adding the superiority die  to the attacks damage roll so i would like to direct the tiger thing to attack the tiger thing  marisha im there  wil can i do that  matt you can yeah  wil so thats with my first attack situation  matt so first roll your damage from the strike  wil six plus six slashing damage 12 slash  matt 12 slashing nice  
none	 wil do i roll the superiority die for her or does she roll it  matt you give it to her you can roll it now and shell add it to her damage  wil you dont want to touch this so just roll a d10  marisha good to know  matt so now he looks to you and gives you the opportunity to attack the rakshasa as a reaction  marisha roars so im going to do my bite attack and i get to add this  matt to your damage  marisha to damage okay so thats 
none	 15  matt 15 misses you strike out and the rakshasa right at your face ducks out of the way and has a  small cane to its side that it knocks your strike to the side  marisha sorry  wil thats all right second attack  marisha do i get to keep this or was that the only time  matt thats the only time  wil ha thats a two  matt all right you hit the side of its armor and deflects off the side with a loud ringing sound  wil attack number three is

none	 28 i think will hit go ahead and roll damage  wil great oh and let me look at these things and see if any of this useless stuff is going to  do any good for me at all oh you know what im going to use this as a maneuvering attack i can  expend a superiority die to maneuver one of my comrades into a more advantageous position one of  my comrades can move theres no point in doing that i thought i could move the bad guy which is  what i could do if 
none	 i had a pushing attack all right so can i use my riposte when a creature  misses you with a melee attack use your reaction and expend a die to  make a melee attack against it  matt youd do that if it attacks you  wil great okay so im just going to remember that i have that  matt just do your damage  wil 13  matt all righty so out of the six strikes three make contact youre starting to carve sections  into the leathery connecting areas of the shield guardian youre doing

none	 its backwardturned hand  trying to grasp out and push you off as it tears you away you got a chunk of its meat and for  some reason you did a lot more damage than you thought you would you hit some sort of vulnerable  point in its body or theres something about the attack method that it did not like gasps roars  it hisses at you with this guttural tiger growl tiger on tiger  marisha i go growls right back to him  matt you going to stay put or are you going to move

none	 fists  wil and my last attack 23  matt 23 hits as it pulls back from knocking away your blade you use the inertia to spin it around  and come down on top with your axe  wil hey i have a dumb question and im sorry this is at your discretion but i can add a d10 to  my attack roll after ive made the attack roll  matt you add it before i tell you if it hit or missed so you can roll and be like i dont know  if that will hit 
none	 or not let me add my dice to it  wil i get it so im going to hit again 11  matt 11 all righty knocked away and then come down with a third hit cracking in the center of  the breastplate the breastplate actually separates slightly you can see a little of the  arcane energy holding it together underneath starting to knock some damage into it you can see  its taken a little wear and tear its still pretty hefty but youre starting to dig into the  shield guardian does that end your turn 
none	  wil can i use second wind it says i can take it as a bonus action but i dont know how bonus  actions work  matt you get one bonus action every turn if you have an ability that uses one  wil oh great so i get hit points equal to d10 plus my fighter level  matt go for it  wil 11 plus ten is 21  matt there you go very nice ends your turn back at the top that is hotiss turn hotis  begins looking at itself it moves it gets an 
none	 attack from you marisha  marisha thats 20  matt so that does hit  marisha awesome im going to do my bite attack again oh wait thats a d20 eight damage  piercing damage again  matt all right you strike once again as it runs by you get a chunk out of it and it grunts  growls in anger and pain you notice at the same time that she takes the bite out of it the  guardian shudders like it suddenly took an impact on its own as it charges away though it runs  out 
dung	 of the field of silence it is going to begin casting a spell on itself and immediately  drifts up toward the ceiling it is now currently flying in the room about ten feet up right now  will hes flying now  orion i can do that too  matt thats going to end its turn vax youre up  liam im going to use my bonus action to hide  matt okay  liam 27  matt 27 okay  liam two daggers out of the dark ill keep that that is a 30  matt remember in 
dung	 order to properly hide you would have to go somewhere where you would remain  out of the sight of the individual  liam can i squat down behind kash  will wait whoa  liam all right you tell me i dont know how bright or dark it is in here  matt hiding behind another party member is a little hard to do  liam can i run narutostyle low now hes behind me toward the statue and crouch at the  base of it and then shoot up from there  matt yeah thanks to your stealth 
none	 roll the guardian does not see you it cant get a  reaction anyway because its slowed from you so yeah youre able to scoot around to the side  there and then fling the daggers around the corner the rakshasa  apparently has not noticed you  liam okay first roll was a 30  matt that hits and it does do sneak attack damage  orion good job lara i mean vax  marisha kill this thing  liam counts quietly 38 for the one dagger  matt 38 damage okay first off when you throw the dagger 
none	 and it strikes it hits the side of  the ribcage of the rakshasa who is floating up and grunts it doubles over in severe pain more  than you expected it would be and it clutches and tries to grab the dagger to pull it out before it  vanishes from the wound leaving the blood pooling out of it it looks like it was hurt significantly  by this attack more so than you were expecting however at the same time the shield guardian  doubles over for a second the link appears to be sharing the damage 
none	 between the two of them  marisha piercing damage yo  will when you hit either one or just when you hit the rakshasa  matt apparently just when you hit the rakshasa  liam number two probably going to go astray that was 14  matt 14 nope all right so that is vaxs turn the rakshasa you can see is clutching its side  now and theres blood beginning to pool around its robe and it pants is looking around with  nervous eyes that brings us to the end of vaxs turn kash youre up  will 
none	 whos over here  matt over here  will no near the shield warrior whos over there the shield guardian  matt this is thorbir and vax  will okay im going to move a little bit even though hes floating i can still move closer to  the rakshasa correct  matt you can yes  will i want to move a little bit closer and then cast spiritual weapon  matt okay all right so you create a spiritual weapon of some kind  what weapon would you like to create  will how about a giant mace 
none	  matt okay so as you clutch your holy symbol to yourself now theres a sudden pillar of bright  vibrant healing light surrounded by that same halo of pitchblack darkness almost like this strange  border around it this duality hits the ground and as it vanishes you can see on the  ground this shimmering almost staticy mace is left behind almost flickering in and out of  existence it drifts off on its own and is now hovering in the air next to you  will sweet  laughter  matt do you wish to send it 
none	 up  will i do i wish to send it towards the rakshasa concentrate all fire on the rakshasa  matt okay whats the damage on the magical weapon  will when i cast the spell i can make a melee spell attack against a creature within five feet  of the weapon  matt all right so roll a d20 and add your spell attack bonus  will spell attack bonus is 20  matt 20 hits roll damage its 1d8 plus five which is your spell bonus  will 1d8  marisha all those blue guys yeah  
none	 liam give him the al capone kash  will five and five so ten  matt okay ten points of damage all right so as it slams into the side the rakshasa gasps takes  the brunt of it to its arm and the shield guardian shudders slightly in the distance  will it says that now i can as a bonus action on my turn move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat  the attack against the creature within five feet of it so can i swing it around and attack him  again from the back 
none	  matt you can use your bonus action to do that yes so it drifts behind and makes a second  strike roll a d20  will a d20  matt a d20 to try and hit and add your spell attack bonus  will ten damn it  matt ten this time the rakshasas a little more wise to your plan as it swings around it  actually uses its fly to dip down as it swings and then comes back up around in its place  gliding and staring at it with a snarl snarls i believe that 
none	 ends your turn now the shield  guardian turns this way and now its taken notice of the rogue that has run up and eviscerated a  portion of its master its going to pivot in place and bring both fists  right down towards you  liam im going to uncannily dodge  matt okay what does that do again  liam once a round i can halve the damage  matt for one attack right well that one will be a 25 to hit  liam oh yes  matt and that will be a 14 to hit 
none	  liam no  matt so the one that hits you 15 damage bludgeoning damage  which is halved to eight damage  orion whats above us  matt above you its about a 15foot ceiling 15 to 20foot ceiling  orion okay any light coming down  matt nothing in particular no you just have the wall sconces up there this room has been  repurposed from its original construction and hidden away it looks like it was initially some  sort of storage or altar room based on how it was designed all right that ends its turn 
none	 keyleth  youre up  marisha okay since hes floating im going to go growls and go for the spiritual guardian  ooh the first one is a 21  matt that hits  marisha oh sorry 22  matt is this a pounce  marisha can it be a pounce was i far enough away  matt if you move back and then pounce you could  marisha then fuck yeah its a pounce  matt you have the movement to do so so you back up growls leap and pounce on the shield  guardian  marisha so 
none	 does he succeed his strength saving throw dc 14  matt nope not with a three  marisha then he is knocked prone  matt impact noise slow and prone  marisha and then i make a bite attack which is a 19 ooh thats not good in terms of damage  seven damage  matt seven damage all righty so as you jump on it you force it to the ground you see the thing  topple towards you and you have to step back to avoid it thorbir it crashes into the ground and  now minxie the 
none	 white sabertoothed tiger is on top of it and starts biting and clawing at it  dealing a bunch of damage to the front of its armor very cool that ends keyleths turn  tiberius youre up strangely enough none of this makes any sound its a silent battle it is  the creepiest quietest fight over here right now  orion im going to cast obelisk of stone rakshasa the butthole and smash the shit out of  both of them 20 feet high maximum height  matt okay im looking up the spell real fast  marisha dex 
none	 save  orion its a dex save  matt thats a natural 20 for the rakshasa and that is a six for the shield guardian  orion so hes pinned to the ceiling and they both take 21 damage  will and marisha laugh  will whats that weird james gandolfini breathing next to me its really bizarre  matt im clarifying this because the spell says this they make a dex saving throw or theyre  lifted by the pillar if they make a save they are not touched by the pillar  orion right that means they dont 
none	 get pinned by it  matt no they dont take any damage if they make their save they dodge out of the way thats how  the spell is designed  orion all right  matt its primarily intended to be a defensive spell that can occasionally be used offensively  if they fail their save the shield guardian takes the damage  orion and hes pinned  matt and hes pinned currently yep  wil and will nice move  will get him stormchaser  matt all right the rakshasa dodges out of the way and there is now 
none	 a giant pillar in the middle  of the room  orion i look at him and im like  matt all right that ends your turn tiberius thorbir youre up  wil can i hit the guardian  matt currently it is pinned against the ceiling so you cannot hit it  wil right so i cant do anything can i just delay  matt you can if you want to you can use your action to hold off until something triggers which  could be moving into range in case you could then take your action on it 
none	  wil ill do that i cant get the rakshasa  matt not from that distance no so youll wait for this thing to try and find its way out all  right cool so that brings us to the top the rakshasas turn  wil oh but i am calling out and yelling at and taunting at the guy and its just this  mouthing words  orion oh because of the silence ill dissipate the spell so i can hear him were you trying to  say something thorbir  wil shouting and i will be naked and 
none	 riding through the desert  laughter  matt the rakshasa finishes scanning the room for a second and he says well this has been a lot  of fun i appreciate this little scuffle however i have other business to attend to looking at the  rest of you at least i know where to hit you all the hardest i know you have a father you seek i  know you have family in draconia i know you have a sister that is not too far from here and you i  know you have one you hold dear 
none	 to your heart i can now see your minds see their faces and i  will see them soon however i must say adieu and he begins to cast  orion 4thlevel counterspell  marisha tiberius  matt you already used one 4thlevel counterspell from your ring earlier  orion yeah and i have two stored in there  matt how do you have two 4thlevel counterspells in a ring that can carry  up to four levels of a spell  orion no i can carry five up to 4thlevel spells its my ring of spell storing it can 
none	  carry up to five spells that go up to 4th level  marisha no thats not how it works  matt it can carry up to four levels of spells  orion i dont understand that  liam you can do four level1 spells you can do one level4 spell you can do two level2 spells  orion thats not how it worked before  marisha yeah thats how my ring works as well its a level5 ring of storing  matt welcome to dungeons and dragons its all good you have counterspell as a spell you know  
none	 though right  orion yeah still 4thlevel counterspell  matt okay good to know that makes a difference let me doublecheck one thing real fast because  this will make or break the circumstance really  orion as a matter of fact no 6thlevel counterspell growling you will go nowhere  matt all right  orion thats far as i can go  marisha we go to 11  matt all right it is a 7thlevel spell so lets go ahead and roll  marisha come on  orion do i have advantage or anything  marisha i dont think 
none	 so  matt okay dont roll yet  orion okay  will laughs thats awesome okay hes in charge  matt okay so roll a d20 and your spellcasting ability is five for this  liam dont piss off tetsuo man  matt so you roll a d20 add a five i will say you have advantage on this because you were  expecting and waiting for this so go ahead and make your first roll roll one at a time  marisha okay  orion 19  matt 19 all right  marisha oh take that 19  orion 
none	 19  matt 19 all right to counter this spell as a level seven you needed to roll a 17 or higher  you are targeting the spell not the rakshasa itself as you can see its form begins to  shimmer and you see a small gate begin to open around its form you as a reaction reach up and  unleash your torrent of countering arcane energy it hits this opening gate the gate then  fluctuates and shuts at which point the rakshasa goes quiet growl and for the first time  really in this entire battle 
none	 looks genuinely scared  will yeah  marisha fucking kill it  liam you were saying something about my sister  orion shouting no one threatens a goddamn stormwind  will what he said  orion i think i just broke my hand  laughter  matt dont break your hand its going to fly actually its going to fly toward the door  will towards the door  matt yeah thats all the movement it can get there but it is heading towards the exit  marisha oh hes fucking trying to leave  liam he suddenly turns pink 
none	 and says snagglepuss impression exit stage right even  laughter  matt hes gliding toward the doorway over everybody that brings us to vaxs turn  will come on vax dont let this bitch leave  liam how far is he from that statue  matt from this statue here at that height id say its about 30 feet  liam 30 feet okay hes not paying attention to me can i use my bonus action to go stealth  matt youre partially obscured by the statue id say you can do that  liam all right with advantage come 
none	 on you fucking motherfucker that is 28 and im throwing  daggers at the back of his head yes that is a 27 do we call that sneak attack  matt he did not see you stealth actually he did not roll high enough perception so you have sneak  attack on him  marisha ugh im out of alcohol its the worst time to be out  wil druid needs booze badly  liam 30  matt 30 damage  how do you want to do this  cheering  liam ive got the dagger in my hand right 
none	 i see him flying away im crouched down i flip it over  so the blades in my hand i dont go fast i just take my time pull back throw it harder than i  usually do through its neck out the front  matt the dagger hits it in the back of the neck and the spine it doesnt quite cut through the  spinal column you see it comes out the front of the throat choking noise the spell falters  thud it falls to the ground taking a serious impact fall and is now grunts dragging 
none	 itself  towards the exit of the room as you start walking up to collect your blade coughing gasping it  brings up its hand to start trying to cast a spell wet choking sound it coughs this big pool  of blood onto the ground  liam i grab it by the ear and lift its head back you talk about my sister again  matt death rattle with a spray of crimson across the ground and this horrible sucking sound  you pull back the head as the life force of the rakshasa comes spraying across the stone 
none	 floor as  you release it and leave it to the ground with the last bit of life left in its body leaves its form  you hear this chuckle ill find you  liam and i boot it into the acid  will no we need the eyes  matt laughs the body tumbles into the acid sizzling sound you guys run over really quickly  and pull it out  will what were you thinking laughs  liam dont push my buttons man  wil has the animation gone out of the guardian  matt the shield guardian 
none	 that was currently struggling has gone limp  pinned against the ceiling  will nice work  marisha okay i go over to it and i bust out my book and i start harvesting all the parts we  need whos got the contract what all do we need  will who has it i dont have the contract  liam i never touched it  will we need the eyes i didnt have the contract  wil you had the contract  will i did not you were in charge  wil i was not in charge i was 
none	 never in charge i was sent here to be a babysitter  will thats in charge as far as im concerned  matt does nobody have the contract  orion is it behind us  liam oh come on  marisha we signed it after and left it somewhere  matt it might have ended up in the storage  liam oh the actual physical  matt the actual physical contract  marisha might have ended up in storage  wil someone from production made us sign it  liam here it is clearly right here  marisha the fangs 
none	 and the tongue  will ah yes  marisha we found it  matt that would have been a real shame to get all this far  marisha i got it cool  will we got it its all good what do we need  liam were fine here everythings fine  wil liam and will how are you  marisha okay i have my book which i think gives me advantage i think is how it works  matt gives you advantage on those yeah  marisha yeah okay gives me advantage so i have to do this individually 
none	 for each one correct  matt correct roll two at a time to make it more expedient  marisha two at a time okay first for the eyes and tongue ooh ill take that 18 and 20  natural 20  matt well its with advantage so the first rolls a 20 thats for the eyes  marisha thats for the eyes  matt without a problem pop both eyes out  marisha tongue ill also take that natural 20  matt there is a purpose you serve  will and its the balance on the sides of the room 
none	  marisha ill take that  wil i am good for something  marisha and for the heart thats 16 total  matt 16 all right with some difficulty you manage to eventually tear the heart out of the  chest cavity its a very nasty process and most of you guys well not so much you guys youve  seen a lot of crimson but watching this little druid girl seemingly unfazed by the process of  tearing into the chest of this rakshasa is very disconcerting  liam come on mononoke  marisha here hold this  matt 
dung	 and it is this dark dull red like overcooked meat  marisha okay the claws oh ill take that 19 30 oh sorry 29  matt you take each one of the hands of the rakshasa the backturned strange upsidedown  humanoid hands and cut them off at the wrists very cleanly and both are  harvested without issue  marisha and the canine teeth ill take that 15 for 25  matt 25 total  marisha total  matt you take the rest of the head you can see this terrible grin this perpetually pulled smile  from its 
none	 final moments you manage to pull out very cleanly both of the canines from the inside  of the mouth  marisha tiberius do you have any vials left over empty vials  orion yes of course  marisha can i try and harvest some of the blood as well to keep for personal use  orion thats exactly what i was going to do  will gags for the love of gags  orion im taking some of the blood for sure filling some vials  marisha are you squeamish about blood kashaw  will im a healer  
none	 matt its a little difficult since a rather large portion of the rakshasas blood is currently  spattered across the floor thanks to vax you manage to harvest one vial of its blood  marisha one vial  matt one vial  orion im going to take my dagger out and im going to shave trimmings from his fur and his  whiskers ill take those  matt you currently have a vial of rakshasa shave scum  will thorbir you want the taint theres tons of magic in it  laughter  wil i take the jeweled dagger and 
none	 i walk down to the corpse of the rakshasa i drive the dagger  through one of the eye sockets and i say you will never harm my daughter  matt the dagger is left there as a proclaiment and all of you feel the weight behind that  whispered statement and decide it might be best to leave that dagger where it sits  wil let us conclude our business  orion very good  matt as youve completed the harvesting you notice the contract the sigils that currently  lock it flash and seem to vanish from the 
none	 paper your contract completed for the sake of brevity  you all manage to make your way arduously and with much difficulty not through the amaranthine  oubliette because that would be difficult but retracing your steps back through a tunnel which  has been sealed shut by iron pillars  orion we have to break through those first fireball fireball fireball breaky breaky  breaky  matt thats a terrible idea creating explosions in small enclosed earthen tunnels is a really  good idea  will laughs no problem  matt they completed the contract but then all suffocated 
none	 due to a sudden cavein it was so  unfortunate the second team  orion i had a bottle of air  matt everyones just permanently breathing air it is the worst fate ever for a pc  liam gather around watch what i can do  laughter  matt it takes you a long time to retrace your steps and find your way through the entrapment  especially since as you remove the iron pillars the boulder then begins to roll past so you carve  your way through you make your way precariously back to the velvet cabaret 
none	 back into the room  where the rakshasa once lived do you wish to walk into the center of the velvet cabaret covered in  various fluids  wil fuck yes we do  will yeah i think absolutely  matt all right boof the door slams open and you all step into the center of the velvet  cabaret as you do two of the guards turn and see you exit hey hey wait what are you doing  and they go for their blades to the side  will seriously  orion i turn around and go like 
none	 you really dont want to do that friend trust me please  matt make an intimidation check  orion oh what is that 14  matt 14 he rolled a three he looks to the other guy as long as youre leaving  orion garbled draconian again  laughter  wil thorbir just keeps walking  matt he sheathes the sword and they give a wide berth you can hear the music playing and  everyones laughing as you enter the room the music comes to a stop  marisha right before we leave i turn and have a piece 
none	 of pelt from the rakshasa and i throw it at  the guards feet and i say here thats whats left of your boss  matt he steps back for a second some of the other patrons are watching this some look scared  some look intrigued by this whole sudden arrival of strange warriors covered in various ichor  watching as you step out a swarm of them look at the feet and one of them goes oh they killed  some sort of tiger thats not an accent  laughter  matt another whos watching says they bought 
none	 that down at the market the guards take it and  lift it up with the blade and look strangely and you see coming out of the far corner the bashful  owner of the establishment that you had previously knocked unconscious looks out not wanting to  engage just watching you as you leave with a look of fear on his face you step out onto the  thoroughfare close the door behind you back into the quad roads district making your way towards  the slayers take guildhall  liam on the way out i grab two glasses 
none	 of ale and i hand one to this guy and just walk and dont  say shit  matt no one argues  wil thorbir is genuinely touched by this gesture  matt as you sip you make your way through the main thoroughfare back to the center of the  quad roads to the slayers take guildhall you step inside and there across the way in  midconversation with his wife is mertin talking to the huntmaster vanessa as you enter they  both turn with a look of excited surprise  i assume that this means the contract 
none	  went well right  wil its done  marisha i take a canvas bag and i plop it on the table full of the rakshasa bits  matt excited chuckles he shows it to the huntmaster she glances down with a smile very  good i am glad that we gave you such a trusted member as your overseer you did well thorbir  thank you for your effort in keeping these fledglings alive  orion one more insult madam and you will find your whole establishment on fire  marisha tiberius  orion im not in the mood 
none	  matt its not meant as an insult im sorry perhaps you do not understand that we speak with  terms of endearment  orion oh well in that case i take it as a compliment  matt very well so looking at the contract is everything hopefully in order she takes it from  you looks into the contents of the bag very well you shall be paid out in full and scattered  amongst your party as you see fit  marisha and our counterparts the rest of our party have they returned  have they checked in 
none	 yet  matt not yet they are still out at the moment theyve been gone for about as long as you have  been youve returned faster than they have let us hope that they are safe but i have faith they  seemed very intent on completing this without issue so i would not be too worried i will  notify you upon their return though  marisha please do  matt where are you staying  marisha where are we staying  will i thought as members of the take you got to stay here  matt you 
none	 could if you like we have room and technically as of this contract you are all  officially members of the take you may stay here if you wish  orion i need a bed and i motion towards the thing im sleepy  marisha well wait here  matt very well we shall hold off the ceremony for when the rest of your team arrives  wil if the rest of this team is half as good as these members the take has grown much stronger  this day theyre worthy  matt she crosses her arms and her 
none	 usual jovial passive attitude grows a little more stern she  gives a nod of genuine respect towards thorbir and for the first time she looks about the rest of  you with a slightly intense look of really understanding the essence of strength between and  behind each of you i believe youre correct i think there will be great things ahead for us  welcome to the slayers take she reaches down brings up a small wooden chest sets it on the  edge and opens it on the inside you can see it is rather abundant in 
none	 gold and platinum of which  the total comes to counts quietly 5100 gold pieces for this contract  that is 1020 gold each  marisha 1020 gold  matt correct  will you can split up my take amongst them i take it my obligation has been fulfilled  matt it has  will you know i have no desire to stay  matt if you insist but you know that whenever you come back to our little humble abode you  always have a place to stay and work at your disposal brother kash  will thank you
