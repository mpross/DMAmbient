none	 the beholder kvarn deep in the underdark once they had completed this journey  they spent some time in the city trying to figure out what can be done there preparation for  possibly keyleth making a venture out to one of her ashari tribes during which grog entered a fight  ring and lost and the party decided to go ahead and  marisha never forget  matt i have a feeling kern and grog are going to have a round two in the near future depending on  how grogs feeling about that then the party saw that 
none	 there was some sort of hydralike being that had  been harrying the walls of the outskirts of the city of vasselheim being the adventurers they  are they took it upon themselves to leap out into the jungles and the forests of the vesper  timberland found and hunted down this hydra fought it and upon slaying it discovered there  was another group also hunting this hydra an actually sanctioned group and that hunting this  hydra is considered illegal in  vasselheim unless you had actually been contracted to  do so so in breaking the laws 
none	 of vasselheim they could have been tried for it but instead chose to  return to the city with this group of hunters and be brought before their guildmaster the  huntmaster known as huntmaster vanessa cyndrial basically they were given the choice they could  go to trial or they could undergo their own personal trial to join the guild the slayers  take which is essentially a guild that takes on contracts to hunt various requested creatures  down harvest elements of their physical bodies to then be sold or returned to these individuals and  be paid 
tavern	 for it if they manage to complete these trials they will be absolved of breaking the law  because they will now be within the confines of it and will be members of the guild so choosing  that they were then also notified that they would be splitting up into two different groups much to  the chagrin of vex and vax our twins  will split apart  liam separation anxiety is a real thing  matt so this group the second adventuring group has gathered itself back to the bellows respite  inn vax you were asked 
tavern	 to go the bar to join your sister vex for a shot of the hardest liquor  they had available to deal with the coming separation you shared a brief breakfast shared  your bitter spiteful alcoholic imbibement and then went your separate ways the first group went  initially and its been about an hour or so of you guys waiting in the tavern for them to as far  as you know take care of their business before you were to go to the guild yourselves so we have  tiberius keyleth and vax all sitting around the 
tavern	 bellows respite tavern lamenting whats going to  come next  orion oh cheer up vax shell be back soon ive never seen you quite so down  marisha ive been separated from my parents for a really long time you get used to it  its not too bad  liam it took you years to do that im two minutes in so ill grieve a little bit longer  marisha dont say the word grieve thats strong  orion yes its implying that someone has died and no one has so you know  marisha its only a 
tavern	 few days itll be good separation makes the heart grow fonder and all  that stuff  liam its fine i just have a low tolerance for bullshit and id like to get past this little  piece of shit that were being made to swallow  orion i agree stormwinds should not be meddling around with these peasants are we in a tavern  matt you are currently in the bellows respite tavern  orion barkeep bring me your finest ale for my friend here and for the lady ill take a water  matt the relatively jovial gingerbearded 
none	 rotund human gentleman who runs the establishment  comes over to you looks like himself is a little blearyeyed and hasnt quite adjusted to the  morning light itself oh okay certainly ill go ahead and retrieve that for you its three three  is what im looking at  marisha what time is it  matt right now id say its roughly 900 to 1000 in the morning  marisha oh sure lets start early why not  orion and i flip him a couple of gold coins  matt he tries to catch it fumbles goes and pick 
none	 it up  marisha dont throw thats rude  matt five minutes go by your food and drink are brought to your table and you continue to lament  about the coming time is there anything else you guys wish to take care of before you make  your way to the slayers take guildhall  marisha well since were getting separated grog is taking the bag of holding  orion i have one dont forget that  marisha right but we had a lot of stuff in that bag of holding i kept most of the stuff that i 
none	  needed on me but how many healing potions do we have  liam not a lot thats what im concerned about we lost our meat shield and we dont have pike so  i think we probably need to go and get some potions  marisha i can go ahead and brush up on healing spells as well make sure i come a little bit  more wellequipped just in case  orion im good on potions but we should restock our supply  liam how many have you got  orion i have let me see here three 
dung	 potions of greater healing and three  regular potions of healing  liam can i have one  orion i suppose if were just going to buy more it doesnt matter but just in case something  happens along the way  liam thank you  marisha i only have one greater healing potion right now  orion yes so well go buy more and then well see what else they have i would like to see if we  can procure a couple of items like a couple of empty vials ive used a lot of mine maybe find 
none	  some acid or whatnot at these item shops so lets look around and get the stuff  marisha okay  matt okay go ahead and make an investigation check  marisha apparently we have the flying carpet  liam do we have the flying carpet  matt the flying carpet is for the most part kept wrapped up in grogs bag of holding  marisha because i think grog was checking out hes breaking up a little bit but i feel like he  just told me that we took the flying carpet  liam imitating grog we took 
none	 the flying carpet sorry  marisha hes very far away but i feel its reaching its limits  liam imitating grog i would like to bogart the flying carpet and everything in the fucking bag  marisha he apparently left us with the flying carpet  orion hes saying he left with the flying carpet keyleth he left with it we dont have it  marisha he said remember you took the flying carpet to break rp for a second  liam imitating grog am i texting you that right now  marisha yeah i cant youre cutting out youre 
dung	 cutting out grog  orion i held it for a time but i only have my wheel of mending in mine as far as i know hold  on let me check  matt as you reach into your bag of holding  orion im thinking really hard  matt through the luck of the draw it seems to be that the last resting place of the flying carpet  was within your bag of holding  orion hold on oh here it is  marisha oh look at that we have it  orion shut my mouth i guess 
none	 i was wrong  marisha found it were good  liam all right lets go to the store i dont really want to drag this out any longer than we  have to and i walk out the door and start going  matt okay what did you roll for your investigation check tiberius  orion 16  matt 16 okay as you guys take the next 20 minutes wandering the quad roads district of  vasselheim asking around a lot of the shops here offer general supplies there are a few that are  focused on the mining supplies 
town	 as there is a large market mining cobalt out of the center of the  mountain the city is built around you find places that provide clockwork for large grandfather  clocks that are starting to be distributed in this part of the city you also find that there is a large  bazaartype market in the center of the quad roads that you passed by when you first came to town  amongst many of these barkers you do catch one small tent tiberius that catches your eye  because it resembles the same purple color as one tent 
town	 you guys entered in emon about a year or so  ago in which you encountered a fortune teller  marisha oh shit its the witchs fortune what are you looking for  liam look at those fingers fly  orion i approach  marisha do you know her name remember her name i can probably find it it would take a minute of  digging through hang on ive got to go back to my old notes ive got to go back to my old dd  notes keep doing stuff  matt so as you enter the tent 
town	 you pull the curtains apart there is one other individual who  seems to be just perusing the interior but the smell that hits you immediately is very heavy  sage ceremonial burning of various spices giving the area a mystical scent the light itself is  very low just a few flickering candles and a hooded lantern in the far corner directed outward  give a bit of ambiance to the interior of the tent the series of small ropes and cords made of  hemp and silk carry trinkets and bones and various enchanted accoutrements and in the 
town	 far back  corner amongst the table there is indeed a very beautiful elven woman dressed in a fine silk gown  with a metallic headband her dirty blonde hair behind her ears and she looks to be in the middle  of shuffling a deck of tarot cards as you enter she looks up and gives you a look of surprise and  then a curious look of remembrance  marisha am i with him  matt youre behind him and outside of the tent he entered did you guys want to go in with him  liam and 
none	 marisha yes  matt all right you enter and are greeted by this same atmosphere  marisha gasps trista  matt she gives you a cross look  marisha its been so long fancy meeting you here  matt she puts her finger up for a second turns over to the noblewoman who is currently perusing  this small shelf of books and tomes im terribly sorry would you mind just giving us a moment  ive some personal business to attend to  the noble woman is like oh fine i didnt want to purchase anything anyway and stomps 
town	 out of  the tent the door closes behind her  at which point the elven woman immediately turns tristas my sister  marisha youre forsythia  matt its good to see you again young halfelf you can see now with the current  atmosphere the light seems to dim the interior of the tent and the elven womans visage shimmers  and then fades and there sitting behind the table you see a large hunched forward gnarled  humanoid this woman who is definitively referred to as a hag is currently  lording over the table long twisted fingers 
none	 holding that same deck of cards looking up at you  with a crooked nose and pointed chin theres a grin on her face and looks to you and it has  been some time dragonborn i can still see there is a fraction of you still missing  orion yes i still dont know what that means but i am actually happy to see you milady  matt still shuffling her cards so was there anything i can help you with  orion yes yes there is you mentioned before when i asked you last of the boros ring 
none	 you  revealed that it was in the fey the wild fen i am also in search of the item that i did not get  to ask you about called the pale stone i wish to know the location of that as well  matt she gives you a keen look i think for the time being one quest is enough return when youve  procured this ring you so graciously seek then perhaps the rest of this will be revealed grow  greedy with fate and i fear the timeline will swallow you up young dragonblood she pulls 
none	 the  cards down and just starts going over her own reading each card she slams down with a heavy  thud the room seems to almost cloud the air growing thicker and theres a hint of frustration  that shes currently being bothered and strung out after she takes a few moments to herself she  looks back you is there business you seek aside from asking me these questions perhaps a bauble  or two i make fine baubles  orion since youre not in the business of information then we are in the business of  procuring 
town	 some specific items potions im looking for a few empty glass vials perhaps some  acid if you have it  matt she stands up and as she stands up you can now see the hag which hunched forward sits at a  solid five feet tall at full height even with the hunch shes now cresting the top of the tent  at seven feet long stringy grayblack hair framing the shoulders the same nice goldish silk  outfit the elf appearance was wearing is there it looks much more worldtattered and matches the one  currently wearing it 
none	 she reaches behind her still staring you intently in the face and grabs  a small case off the wall sets it down before her pulls back the wooden lid and inside you can  see there are three small glass vials these are what i have to offer two of them will right your  physical form perhaps take care of some of those wounds someone as foolish and careless as you  eventually deal with the third one is caustic in its nature its application is up to you they are  sold as a set though 300 
none	 gold pieces take it or leave  orion you dont have to be all nasty about it i have the money here you go  matt she reaches over and as you hold the small bag of coin out her hand completely engulfs  yours the fingers wrap around and for a second you feel a tug and you are awkwardly pulled  forward a few inches you get closer to her face the breath catches your nostrils the scent of  swamp water and old fish its a moment of intensity where you forget your surroundings for a  
none	 brief moment and its just you and this entity and you realize shes far older than you ever  gave her credit for she pulls the bag of coin from your hand and withdraws the light seems to  return from the peripheral of your vision keyleth and vax are there at your side she reaches  forward and pushes the box forward toward you on the table be safe and may fortune smile upon  most of you  orion yes i know something bad is going to happen i show them the box i take it and pick 
none	 it  up this is all she had to offer shes not taking questions  marisha youre not taking any questions right now  matt not today  marisha not today  matt as you know my dealings with fate take a lot out of me im not quite ready for another  round of tellings you see this city as most bits of civilization are very eager to hear what  the future has in store for them so im a bit tapped out at the moment and you can see a  bit of dried blood around one 
none	 of her nostrils and if you recall last time the process was very  physically taxing on her perhaps return in a week or so and if im not here im around  liam old one are you still willing to trade today  matt trade  liam im wondering if you have any poisons beyond the runofthemill nightshades  this afternoon or morning  matt she stands up and reaches over and theres a small alchemical glassware set up on the side  and you see its cracked and old and its been brutalized and she pulls a very 
dung	 small vial of  some dark black almost umbratype liquid where you cant even see shine in the light it absorbs all  the light she puts it forward this would be very unfortunate to find its way into the  bloodstream of an enemy yes  liam what do you want for it  matt a favor not now but perhaps down the road  orion she does that vax a lot  liam why not  matt she pushes it forward with her long crooked fingernail shoves the vial forward it screeches  across the top of the 
none	 table she withdraws her hand so it is done at that moment theres a  very a cold shiver down the back of your neck that then fades she just grins with this nasty toothy  grin now be on your way i have cards to shuffle  liam yoink  marisha it was so nice to see a familiar face in such a strange place shes lovely  orion yes good day madam  matt as you step out she raises her hand in front of her and her form once again shimmers and  shifts down to that 
town	 beautiful elven maiden that greeted you as you entered the lights tend to  blossom a little bit and you close the tent behind you  liam as were leaving i say thats a good look  matt gives a slight breathy chuckle that starts beautiful chuckle turns into a cackle  orion what did we actually get  matt you acquired two potions of greater healing and a vial of caustic liquid you are uncertain as  to what its properties are  marisha caustic liquid  matt you also dont quite know the properties of yours but you 
none	 gather the assurance from a  creature of this power that she speaks in riddles but not in untruths  orion im going to give you another one of the greater potions so mark that down  liam thank you were right in the middle of the bazaar do we want to take a quick jog around i  grab someone passing by and say you potions where here  matt the person looks down at your arm brushes it off and the middleaged gentleman goes  sir you do realize that most of the potion trade is controlled by 
none	 the clergy  marisha theyre all like no magic and stuff here  liam i did not know that thank you well shit  marisha wait did he say that it was controlled by the clergy  orion so we should go there  marisha hang on just because it is controlled by the clergy doesnt mean that its legal doesnt  mean that if we go knocking on their door requesting potions that theyre going to take  kindly to that kind of like getting your concealed deadly  weapons license in certain places  liam i grab another 
town	 weirdo passing by and say excuse me theres probably a temple around here  can you point us in the right direction  matt the individual looks at you awkwardly and points over and you can see just past the  outskirts of this bazaar there are a number of buildings that line the outer area of this central  portion you can see where he is pointing there is a large cathedral made of almost from this  distance a warbling warped obsidian and it is far more ominous and obelisklike in appearance  than the other temples in 
none	 a district of the city that you havent been to yet but it is the  closest temple  wil warbling obsidian is my black crowes cover band  liam im getting itchy can we just go to the take please  marisha i turn and i lean into tiberius and i say hes going to be cranky the entire time  were on this field trip isnt he  orion yes and usually im the cranky one  marisha i know  orion so lets head to the temple right yes  marisha i guess  orion can you 
none	 turn into a horse  marisha yes but thats a little forward dont you think  orion im just asking  liam are we going to the temple or the take  orion oh the take what would make you feel better  liam lets get on with it shall we jesus  whoever that is  orion that was that one carpenter we met in in vasselheim  liam oh he was sweet he had some good herb  orion yes he did he sure knew how to it was dank  matt dank which is arcane terms for 
dung	 thaumaturgical anyway you make your way to the  southern outskirts of this portion of the bazaar which leads its way into the central building  cluster portion of the quad roads district to the outside of the slayers take guildhall you walk  up to the main doorway which has the inscription in front and pushing the door open you enter  into the main foyer area where you see the same castiron chandeliers hanging from the ceiling  the dark wood rafters frame the entire internal area and there sitting at the central desk is  mertin the 
none	 scarredup halfling with the relatively joyful disposition he looks up from  his books okay it appears to me that we have the other half of this adventuring group to deal  with let us hope that perhaps you have better luck than your previous friends in what has been  chosen for you eh  liam they already headed out  matt yes they left not more than an hour ago i imagine  marisha and what were they contracted with  matt oh nothing theyre going to kill a dragon would you like  me to go get 
none	 the mistress for you  liam excuse me  matt ill take that as a yes ill be right back  and he gets up from his table and wanders off  orion theyll be fine im sure of it scanlan makes good decisions all the time  matt as you wait a few moments eventually mertin returns but he seems his head down a  little humbly and gestures out with his hands and you hear the familiar footsteps of the  huntmaster vanessa cyndrial her tiefling appearance both very striking in her chiseled bone  structure in her 
dung	 face her dark leather armor itself creaking slightly with each footstep and  she has that very commanding yet welcoming appearance which you know hides a very  hardtoread interior she steps forward well are you ready to take on the other half of this  mission your friends were eager and they traveled with some of our finer warriors are you  confident in your capabilities today  orion listen dont be smug with me none of us what to be here or cooperate with this stupid  event just to abide your laws  marisha tiberius we could 
none	 be on trial  orion the answer is yes lets get on with it  matt you see it is very simple i like it direct and to the point i respect that  orion oh well thank you  matt the angry flowery part in the middle not so much a fan of all right so she reaches behind  and pulls out what looks like a small rolledup piece of parchment looks at it for a second  well you have one other hopeful for this guild that will be joining you for this and a leader  
none	 will be assigned to you on this excursion to keep an eye on you and make sure you stay within the rules and  not go absconding to some other country and we have to hunt you down  liam fantastic  orion can we use the word liaison  matt a liaison if you will mertin would you get the other hopeful for this  mertin says of course my lady he gets up and walks over and knocks on a door as you hear the  door knock on the opposite side of the room opens it up 
none	 and the red tousled hair halfling  kashaw your group has arrived  will well its about time im sick of waiting sighs he walks out and meets everybody  matt as you guys look the door opens and a human male steps out into the light if you wish to  describe yourself  will i am kashaw vesh an acolyte here i am waiting for you for so long now do i have to  travel with them the entire time  matt for the remainder of this contract at least but once you have joined the guild 
none	 perhaps  other groups will be assigned to you  marisha im sorry im sorry were we late we didnt mean to keep you waiting or do you mean  like youve been waiting for us for a long time in the destiny were here and where have you  been my whole life kind of way  will is she always like this  orion yes she is  liam not good at reading emotions  will this is going to be fun yes no i meant youre late  marisha wait is that what people say about me

none	 matt very well  liam i agree lets hurry it up merkin shall we  will that wasnt your name was it  matt its mertin mertin is the name but its okay  liam im not from these parts its my accent sorry  matt i can hear accent from upbringing its syngornian use its fine mertin never mind by  the way the human that has walked out you can see has shoulderlength brown hair a leather  cord that is tied around the center of the forehead eyes two different colors one i believe  is a 
none	 light blue  will its a light blue one is a bright yellow and his right arm all the way up from where you  can see where it disappears below the armor is covered in oneinch cuts  with scars all the way up  orion ah a religious man  will maybe  matt mertin goes over and knocks on a door opens it up this individual is easy to hear from a  distance the heavy footfalls and the grumbling echoes through the hallways before he even  appears mertin leads you into the light of the 
none	 main foyer area this will be the group of which  you will be guiding on this i appreciate you doing this for us i know its not really usually  what you do but here is your team for this contract  wil im sorry where is the team  matt this is your team  and vanessa chuckles to herself im sorry this is what youll be dealing with today  marisha hi  orion hello im tiberius stormwind  matt now thorbir play nice  marisha what was that  matt thorbir thorbir play nice  wil 
none	 so hes a dwarf hes a really stout dwarf hes got really a long red beard thats singed off  in the lower right corner the bottom of the top part of his beard is braided and clamped off with  all these ornate things hes got these big thick ropey white braids that come down on  either side of his face and frame his face and these have these really big dwarven runes on them  do any of you speak dwarven  orion yes  marisha no  will yes  wil all right so for those 
none	 of you who speak dwarven this is a really offensive curse word in  dwarven and this one is an even more offensive curse word in dwarven you dont say these in  friendly company hes got a scar that runs down across his face and the eye that it  runs through is black and his other eye is blue and you can see that hes got dwarven script  written in tattoos all the way down his right arm  matt so please if you would not mind making sure that they see their contract to fruition  
none	 taking them on this as you will showing them the ropes of the guild and try not get them killed  wil and for me  matt well you will be rewarded as per the contract you will have done the guild a great  favor which you know favors can go a very long way in the guild  wil i certainly do you dont have to tell me about repaying favors  matt fair enough well perhaps now would be a good time for this jovial lot of adventurers to  know what it is they are to 
none	 hunt down  wil is it an actual group  matt well well see how well you can make it into one perhaps this is a test for you as well  fair dwarf  marisha i think is going to be an excellent bonding experience  will seriously the whole time she is like this  orion yes she is it grows on you though  will im sure it does  so does the plague  marisha everyone has such a problem with optimism  matt she unravels it looks at it i think this will do well 
none	 for what is required we will bind  this contract to you now feel free to take over if you wouldnt mind reading halfelf  marisha you know public speaking is not really my strong suit okay ordered and paid in advance  by anonymous  orion oh theyre a fun group  marisha this contract binding in honor and the elements sets upon the agreed members of the  slayers take guildhall and the task of locating and slaying the belowmentioned entity and the  recovery of the belowlisted harvested anatomy items and any anatomy items not recovered or 
none	 not  in functional condition will be deducted from the final payment and refunded to the client oh this  contract is good for three days and should the contract not be fulfilled within that time period  all payments are null and void this contract is null and void and membership of the slayers take  is revoked outside of the huntmasters willful forgiveness  liam skip to the punchline  marisha the quarry has been approved for hunting by the holy paramours of the crown of erathis the  quarry of one rakshasa whats a rakshasa  liam 
none	 tiger man  marisha tiger man  liam essentially  will how do you know that  liam storybooks in syngorn  marisha we need two rakshasa eyes one rakshasa tongue one rakshasa heart two rakshasa claws  and two rakshasa canine teeth so canine  orion would this be an arcana or this be a history check  matt this would be more of an arcana check  orion im going to do an arcana check 18  matt 18 rakshasas were entities that originally stemmed from the realm of the nine hells they are  devils they are 
none	 deceptive and usually embed themselves in elements of society where they can  grasp and take power they love having servitude beneath them and they are notoriously difficult  and slippery to find let alone nail down and destroy appearancewise they look like a normal  humanoid man but have the face of a tiger and the other curious element is both of their hands  are reversed thats as much as you can glean from your formal training and understanding  liam does this cat have a name  matt why does it matter all we know is we 
none	 can confirm that there is one within the vicinity  or huntable at the very least the rest is up to you to find  marisha the quarry is where its been last located oh okay yeah you doublecheck it i  might have missed something  will why cant we know who the client is  matt the client has decided they wish to remain anonymous for this contract  orion this seems to be bothering you kashaw  will everythings been bothering me lately shes not helping do you want to read this  orion its going to 
none	 say the same thing which part  will give me this how far to the quarry  matt your quarry is the creature  will you said it was in the vicinity what are we talking in the vicinity are we talking a days  hike we talking an hour from here  matt meaning weve been able to confirm that there is one that is within a huntable distance  within the three days of the contract however part of this trial is to see just how good you are  at finding and destroying such creatures so that 
none	 information is for you to find unless you do not  feel your skills are up to par for the slayers take in which case you are more than welcome to  go for the door human  liam and you have no further information are there any grumpkins you want us to find do you  expect us to go out with no information at all to find a man with a tigers head  matt well you seem like a welltraveled unit you seem to have done well enough to find and  destroy great things you spoke 
none	 of as you walked into these halls prove to me that you are more  than just sellswords show to me that you have the intellect that you have the skill sets that  you have the cleverness to find the creature that does not wish to be found  liam is this how things normally go around here  wil normally i dont waste my time with the likes of you man with a tigers head is going to  stand out no problem finding him lets stand here and talk about this forever or lets head  out 
none	 and get this over with  orion well dwarf why dont you do your title and lead then and i should warn you you are walking  with a stormwind you may not know my name but i can assure you i alone am an army so we are well  protected so lead us to find this tigerman please  wil dragonborn is a lot of talk  will if hes an army why not just send him out  marisha that was probably the ballsiest thing youve ever said  wil all right storm  orion wind people 
none	 call me tibsy  wil lets see how good you are at following and he heads out  liam hes not very good oh hes gone  matt as the dwarf exits and you guys follow outside of the slayers take into the center of  the main quad roads thoroughfare on the outskirts of the bazaar to seek a rakshasa wherever one may  be found  marisha i thought this was going to be a fun field trip  orion well i mean rakshasa does sound fun rakshasa  marisha it does it is a tiger person so 
none	 maybe we can relate  will i want to switch teams  orion no it gets better  liam whats your name again im sorry  will i am kashaw vesh call me brother kash everyone else does  liam kash brother kash are you new to the guild as well  will im not a member of the guild yet i had something happen with someone who did something  and now im here why dont we leave it at that for now  liam thats how we got here  will apparently i only have to be here 
none	 for another three days which will be good  liam all right  wil im impatient perception 20 is there anything around that indicates where which of  these four directions is the best direction to go  matt knowing the city for the while that youve been here you know there are places of open  business that have a lot of traffic are also good places to ask for if anyone has seen anything  that might match a certain description or an individual that you are seeking any strange  behavior and so you know that the 
none	 center of the quad roads where that bazaar is is a good place  to start requesting information as you have currently none at your disposal  marisha just to get this clear a rakshasas not a beast  matt its like a man  will and orion its a demon  matt its a demon creature that looks like a man  marisha but its not a beast by definition  matt no  liam im sorry id like to make an insight check on the dwarf not to see if he is lying but he  could be 
none	 can i get a gut instinct into what his deal is  matt go ahead and make an insight check  liam three but im going to use my luck to try that again 18 plus two is 20  matt would you like to go ahead and roll a 20  wil yeah thats a two all right  laughter  liam just reinforce the myth man  wil thats one better than i usually roll id say its twice as good as i usually do  matt gruff exterior there is definitely a toughened past to him he 
none	 seems driven not  necessarily untrustworthy per se but definitely a man of little patience and currently does not  seem to be too pleased with the fact that hes essentially babysitting in his mind  liam is there a marshmallow center  matt you may find out in due time yet that is too hard to read at this moment  will if youre in the bazaar do i have to be out of the city to cast locate creature  matt you can cast that anywhere you want to your magic is divine this is your city  
town	 liam and thats not just a descriptor either  will thank you its normally fabulous but not in this city so then how do i go about casting  locate creature  matt you can just tell me  will id like to go ahead and cast locate creature  matt all right so as you guys are having this discussion youre having this weird stareoff and  considering where to go in the bazaar you stop in the nearby alley two buildings down from where the  slayers take guildhall is and you begin just taking a small dagger 
none	 from your side and carving a  circle in the ground throw some runes down that are specific to your patron take a moment and  concentrate on the description of this rakshasa looking at the specifics of the spell to make sure  that i dont give you misinformation locate creature beautiful  will you guys have jazz hands  orion and will rakshasa  matt you focus your mind for a second and your holy symbol begins to drift up from underneath  your armor you instinctively take and slap it down underneath and then refocus your vision 
dung	  your eyes closed and you can see what looks like a pulsing energy like a very dark flame  something that itself you can already smell the sulfur you can smell the lineage the devil  lineage that this entity is and there is indeed one not too terribly far from where you currently are  its faint which means that it is on the outskirts and you know this lasts for a good  thousand feet or so but it does give you a northeastern direction and the spell fades  marisha northeastern direction  will we should 
none	 go northeast it is also unfortunately or fortunately depending on how  you look at it closer than we thought  liam in the walls of the city  will not in the walls but very close to them  marisha do we have any type of plan of attack does anyone know how to fight these things any  earthly clue  will leader boy  marisha leader boy  wil im sorry are you talking to me  orion thorbir is what they meant to say  will listen to stormfather over here  marisha i take my 
none	 social cues from other people im sorry  wil in my experience there has not been a problem invented  that cant be solved with an axe  orion thats true weve seen that  will wonderfully helpful thank you  wil youre welcome  liam follow the axe  wil now what i want you to do is imagine an  hourglass you got that good picture of an hourglass  in your heads see all that sand draining out lets get a move on  orion okay what am i doing with this sand  marisha i agree 
none	 with that are we supposed to do something with the sand  wil yeah count it  marisha oh that would take so long can we tagteam this  wil she always like this  orion yes  will stormclouds counting sand i dont know what shes doing over here northeast how about  lets start walking that way and see what happens can we give that a shot  orion i agree you did the fancy spell  will its not as fancy as you might think  wil ive pulled my axe out and im sort of holding 
none	 it like a walking stick and just very  deliberately very demonstratively walking ahead in that direction  matt with each footfall you know that what was once probably hundreds of years ago a nice  cobblestone roadway in the center of the city has been slowly hit with mud dirt snow sleet and  so each step is a slight moisture with each footfall  orion im assuming theres no stables around  matt not immediately those are usually to the very outside of the city  liam why are you jonesing for a horse  orion so i 
none	 dont get all dirty  matt thorbir leading forward in the northeastern direction that was given by brother kash  eventually brings you around the side of the bazaar and you can now see why its called the  quad roads there are two main roads that meet right where the bazaar occurs and then they spread  off into the other sections of the city to the northeastern section from your guys perspective  the district begins to drift into another district that you have not previously visited this  district is youve heard it mentioned before known as 
none	 the duskmeadow now previous sections  youve been in have been worshipers of bahamut the platinum dragon there was the braving  grounds which worships kord the god of strength and warfare and honor the quad roads which is  under erathis the deity of civilization and invention the duskmeadow falls under the watchful  eye of the raven queen the goddess of death that large obsidiantype structure that you were led  to earlier is the temple that resides in the center of this district and youve heard mention  before of a few of the things that exist 
none	 here that being probably ravens crest which is  the main temple to the raven queen this is also where the amaranthine oubliette is located which  is essentially the prison of the entire city of vasselheim  marisha the what  matt the amaranthine oubliette  orion hammertime oubliette  marisha oh there it is  matt this is also where most of the dead of the city are interred into a series of catacombs that  are built deep beneath this section of the city far enough away from the oubliette to the point  where isnt crossover 
town	 and is enough of an escape because that apparently has happened in the past  history of the city as you begin pushing towards the edge of where the two districts meet you can see  that there is an area of the town that for lack of better term its a more jovial than expected  area there are a series of stands put up along the side of the road theres a lot of beggars  sitting on the side of the street that are currently panhandling to those who walk by there  are a number of 
none	 taverns you can hear music coming from various establishments and it seems almost  the closer you get to the deathoriented district on the border of the quad roads the more and more  it pushes into a shadier mardi grastype experience so you make your way towards that  dividing line there what you would like to do  orion what say you thorbir  wil lets ask around and see if anything has been a little out the ordinary or maybe  in the ordinary  orion yes i like that phrasing  will have to imagine anywhere 
none	 this thing goes theres going to be strange deaths associated with  it we might as well look there  orion thats actually a good idea as well  liam and where were walking are there shops and stands as well or is it residential  matt there are many that sell jewelry many that sell very wellmade clothing some of them party  attire there are some that sell exotic fruits that have been imported in various states of ripeness  marisha is anyone selling any masks  matt make a perception check  marisha passive or active  
none	 matt that would be an active perception check as youre seeking it  marisha 21  matt 21 you do glance around and there is one cart that carries costume party attire supplies  it doesnt seem to have too many customers right now but they do have  a couple of masks that are on display  marisha are there any masks that look like tiger masks  matt looking at it there are none that are tigerspecific no they seem to be molded leather  and some more impish gobliny in appearance  marisha is there someone working 
town	 the stand  matt there is yes you see a woman in her forties or so thin with a big toothy smile her  hair is pulled back into tight bun you can see theres little bit of her blondish hair turning to  gray on the sides around her ears reed richardstyle  orion did you say this was the bahamut part of town too  matt the bahamut section is far away thats another section of the city you are now on the  line between the duskmeadow and the quad roads so its erathis and the raven 
none	 queen  liam im pulling a mask off the wall this is a beautiful piece do you make them yourself  matt i do i do i make them myself by hand hence the price  liam they are quite beautiful were travelers here ive never seen a neighborhood like this is  there a festival going on here or is this pretty much the basic fare of the day here  matt this is the localized festival of the city if youve been around vasselheim long enough  youve seen there is little interest in celebration depending on some 
none	 places but at  least on this line some people can appreciate the fleetness that is life and grasp it by the roots  and make it its own before its snuffed out  liam here particularly there seems to be electricity in the air almost its very bustling  this is the norm around here  matt consistently thats why i come and bring my business here i wouldnt do very well up  north ill tell you that all them dragon types looks to you no offense all them  silver dragon lovers have an issue with things 
none	 as celebratory  liam and i pull out ten gold and i spread them on her desk  matt how many masks  liam oh none  marisha oh i would like one  matt take your pick  liam i slide one coin away from the other nine and then dragging my finger across those say is  there anything out of the ordinary these days  matt go ahead and make a persuasion roll  liam 15  matt 15 she gives you a look like shes trying to read you looks about left and right glances  
none	 at you and looks a little ugh glances at you and looks really taken aback and then comes back to you  with a escape of comfort  liam watching her i pull out another five and spread them in front of the first nine  matt well i mean some businesses here are a bit shady i wont lie and there are some  longstanding businesses that have quarrels usually they end in small scuffles or one  purchases the other and ousts them from the city this is one of the few areas in which the more adult 
none	 pleasures can be  found so theres a lot of money to be had but recently theres been at least from what ive  heard a series of bodies have turned up there were a few found fished out by the bastions in  the water trough on the outskirts of the duskmeadow  liam the bastions what are they  matt bastions who are the guardians of the city from what i hear they had been mauled by some  sort of strange beast  liam mauled  matt now beasts on the outside of the city that i 
none	 can see but on the inside that is the  stuff of nightmares is it not  orion yes i would agree  marisha have you had invaders like this before  matt i mean death is not an uncommon occurrence for certain areas of the city and she gestures  off to the distant temple some people invite it even but such violent death like this is usually  kept to the outside of the city at least with some sort of cause this seems to be a murderous  rampage that me personally i dont want to go 
none	 out at night without protection  marisha is there is any indication of the cause of death on these corpses how do they find them  matt i dont know ive not investigated perhaps you have to ask the bastions yourself  that or anyone who was in the vicinity  liam and can you point us in the right direction  matt she looks around and points off and you can see there isnt a whole lot of bastion  presence in this portion of the city especially since the bastions are more of a voluntary guard  people 
dung	 from the different clergies the different temples train to become bastions and fit  themselves with whatever their deitys armor is you do see there are two bastions armored in a very  dark dark brown leather that carry a symbol of what looks like a silver raven that is embroidered  on one shoulder of a cloak that is tossed to one side  liam these guys are right here essentially  matt yeah oh theyre across the road about maybe a block up i believe theyre bastions from  the duskmeadow perhaps you could ask them  marisha 
none	 does she have any masks that look like a raven a raven mask  matt she does actually have one that looks like a raven  marisha i want that one  matt very well a good choice it doesnt quite match the color of your attire but perhaps i have  an outfit that could match for you  marisha oh  will oh my god were going clothes shopping  marisha do you have a little cloak as well a little cape  matt cloaks i dont but there but there is a cloakery about four blocks that 
none	 way on your left  they can probably help you there  marisha thank you so much  matt of course  liam i notice a serpentshaped mask on the wall i just pick it up and put it on and say thank  you madam much obliged and walk off and clap thorbir on the shoulder and keep walking  wil thorbir hangs back a little bit and waits for them to get to the door and he looks at the shop  keep and do you have any masks that might fit a little girl  matt yes 
none	 of course friend dwarf and she goes and rummages through a small bag and pulls out a  mask this little purple mask that seems to have small fake gems forming the outside with a  couple of ribbons that dangle where it would tie around the head its simple but its pretty  unfortunately not many people bring children to this side of the district they dont sell very  well but if you would like one i would be happy to part with for two gold  wil one gold  matt make a persuasion roll  wil 
none	 18  matt one gold guess it is better to sell it than not at all here you are i must say i wont  tell anyone but purple is a pretty color on you  wil yes it is he walks out  matt all right a few moments pass as you wonder where your dwarven leader has vanished to he  steps out through the front of the establishment  wil lets go  orion great do you have potions are you all potioned up are you good on items thorbir  wil im all right are you 
town	 all right  orion im just fine  liam well were in a rush but if its easy how do you come by potions in this town  wil do i know the answer to that  matt you do theyre either provided from some of your experience by the slayers take but  those are usually offered at the start of a contract the fact that they werent offered on  this means either they dont have any currently at their disposal or they felt that this contract  probably wouldnt require it with the construct of this group 
none	 being set out other than that they  are a little hard to come by a lot of them are controlled by the main temples and are pretty much  given straight to the bastions there arent a lot of individuals that are in need of them within  the city and those that travel out are either members of the slayers take or members of the  bastion forces so they are little hard to come by  wil i think that if were going to find them anywhere it might be around here might be we can  
none	 take some through trade maybe some might fall off a bastion or two  orion well lets go talk to one then shall we  will thought thats what we were doing are going to the two bastions over there or what  orion yes kashaw  will good one other thing you need to know about them theyre horribly paid so money talks with  these people  orion very well  marisha as he goes ahead i keep up my pace until i trail behind him a little bit  will wonderful  liam my hood goes up 
town	 and im gone  matt all right as you guys step across the way its about a block up one of them is partially  inside the alley between two of the buildings you can see he has one hand up on the wall and the  other down one of them is relieving himself on the side of the building while the other is  keeping watch arms crossed looking out across the road the one thats immediately present or  before you you can see is human a scruffy brown beard around the edge of the chin  
none	 the hair itself is cut very short a little heavier in appearance a little muscle a little  layer of winter padding but the black leather armor definitely gives you the appearance of  somebody who is a bastion of the raven queen as you approach the hooded halfelf the dwarf  walking with the giant axe and the bumbling dragonborn the human cleric with a very angry  disposition and the awkward halfelf druid stepping in pace with him gives you all a cursory  look and immediately puts a hand to his side where you can see that 
town	 there is a rapier currently  sheathed aye you walk with purpose  wil we walk for the guild  matt slayers take it is  wil it is  matt what business have you on this side of town then arent you supposed to be out past the  walls killing creatures and such  wil our business takes us where our business takes us our business brings us here today  matt all right then whats your business  wil you might be having some trouble  matt aye  wil whats causing you trouble and whats going 
town	 to get us out of here might be the same thing  matt the gentleman to the left of him finishes shaking off the rest of his alleyway journey  will any more than twice and youre just playing with it pal  matt he turns around and throws his tunic over excuse me its official bastion business  anyway and he nods over to the bearded gentleman whos standing there  there are certain bits of business that are official in this town i dont know how honestly  right it is to be talking with common folk or 
none	 even the guild who does what it likes  wil im sorry youre not talking to common folk  will he wants money  wil i know what he wants  will well then give to him so we can get out of here  liam im circling around  matt make a stealth check  liam 31  matt im not even going to roll im going to ask you to go ahead and you can choose if you want  persuasion or intimidation on this youre riding that line  wil im equally bad at both of them 
none	 but i think that thorbir wants to go intimidation ill give  that a try there it is  orion 20  wil whats the exact opposite of that  laughter  matt you know ive heard about it for so long  wil i know right you cant believe that its a real thing until youre actually there  liam everybody talks about spontaneous combustion but id never believed it  wil its silly its so silly to do this  marisha dice shame  liam naughty  matt i dont know what ancient aztec deitys temple you defaced 
none	 when you were a child but man  all right so as you lean forward  wil please just let me step into a bucket  laughter  matt well get to that as you lean forward forcing your presence on this bastion his hands  still holding the edge of his rapier he steps forward into you to the point where youre almost  forehead to forehead sorry i have to lean down to reach your level but if youre going to go  about asking questions and not offering proper compensation for information well then i think  
none	 we have no business here  wil if its compensation youre looking for lets just speak plain and i pull out four gold  liam and while he has their attention im going to check out his pockets  matt go ahead and make a perception check  liam ew thats not good im going to use luck thats better thats all right perception you  said 28  matt 28 taking a moment as you sneak up behind the one hes talking to the two guys are shoulder to  shoulder squaring off with the rest of this group 
none	 the one that had been relieving himself in  the alleyway is a little bit closer to you you can see as he put his tunic right and everything  he jostled around and revealed a couple of small pouches on his side one of which you heard  a clinking of glass on the inside go ahead and make a sleightofhand check  marisha go rogue go  liam because im wearing a cloak of elvenkind which i know affects stealth checks but not  matt not sleight of hand no  liam thats all right 20  matt 
none	 20 all right you reach over and find the edge of the leather loop that attaches itself to  the side of this bastions belt you tug ever so gently to the side and the loop releases and  you pull it off seemingly without any noticing as you pull out the four gold from inside the  bastion looks out and scoffs and goes clearly pittance fee for this whats to let me think  that you arent actually part of this murder scheme you just walk up and try and start asking  questions like this first off 
town	 where did you hear about it second you look like the kind that  would go ahead and be mauling folks in the street do you not sir dwarf you got the eyes of one  whos probably done a few dark deeds  wil oh i have more than you can imagine  matt then explain to me why we shouldnt take you in for questioning right now and he pulls  his rapier out  orion hold on everybody calm down hi im tiberius stormwind my friend thorbir here  didnt mean to offend of course  matt 
none	 the blade up toward your face and he says look dragon man i was talking to the dwarf  you i have no business with at the moment so youve got ten seconds before we take you in  wil i reach into my pocket and rattle my coins around a little bit maybe i could buy us some  time and i drop ten gold out into my other hand  matt make a persuasion roll  will one no it isnt  matt three  wil thats funny i rolled a three on this die so thats going 
none	 to be a six guys i think were  fighting the bastions i feel like maybe its going that way  marisha you rolled a one  matt i rolled one  marisha you all have really low selfconfidence  matt as you push forward the coins in a semiawkward forceful manner the bastion himself  also seems to be caught offguard and looks down and looks about realizing that now it looks like  you are visibly out in the open paying money to the bastions he looks back people dont stand  out in public and do it 
town	 and he pulls you all off into the alleyway to the side of the complex out  of the middle of the area into the shade between the buildings he reaches over and takes the coins  from your hand and hurries them into a pocket all right look ill tell you what we know but  if youre going to be messing around with this investigation i ask that you dont let anyone  know that you spoke with us this is all on your own and if you do say anything well deny it and  well make 
none	 sure to put you in the oubliette yourself for this all right  orion fair enough  wil and will all right  matt now we have found a series of bodies over the past few years scattered about a few months at  a time between all with a similar pattern of death to them we found large portions the meaty  portions of the body had been torn away some of them apparently eaten there are marks that are  indicative of some sort of beast ravaging the corpses but no signs of a beast coming or going 
none	  and weve had many of our finest trackers looking for any sort of sign of a creature that may have  found its way into the city theyve been in the rooftops the gutters perhaps even the sewers no  sign of any such creature traveling amongst any of these scenes  now all of the bodies have been found wrapped up and discarded in the canals a lot of them  surrounding the abundant terrace looks at the rest of you thats where meloras eye is  watchful whats really got us confused of late is the most 
none	 recent murder that we found was a  very powerful merchant lord from ankharel one thats been in this city for no more than a month  hes wellknown in these parts as bringing in a lot of business his caravans come through via  various skyships and he brings with himself an influx of muchneeded mercantile in the city  marisha whats his name  matt im not allowed to say  will youre not allowed to say  matt the merchants name is tyrell  marisha what  matt tyrell lord tyrell if you say any of this 
none	 to any of our people i swear ill make your life  the hardest its been in months and from the looks of you youve had a very hard few months  lord tyrells body was found but apparently during the murder we have one beggar that  apparently caught sight of this the murderer  as best as we can tell it was some sort of  lycanthrope the beggar was babbling but it seemed there was some sort of wolflike creature  it was seen bipedal walking a man but tore this man right through the throat most 
none	 of his chest  but when spotted didnt run just vanished disappeared no longer in his sight no tracks  left behind just gone didnt know if it was angry poltergeist ghost but the last place he  was staying is at a recent establishment only been here a couple of years referred to as  the velvet cabaret the velvet cabaret  is a very highend place  will i know it well  matt you do he gives you a look of  will ive heard about it from somewhere else  orion scanlan have you been talking 
none	 to scanlan  will dont know who that is stormshadow  orion he likes whores okay its weird  matt the fact that that the lord had been staying at the velvet cabaret for some time and  we were feeling pretty close to possibly finding the source of these murders our bastion force  from the duskmeadow worked with the quadroads and we actually raided it found nothing nothing but  the patrons no sign of any sort of foul play we were forced to leave empty handed thats all  weve got  will i have a question 
none	 about the bodies have you seen them  matt ive only seen the most recent the rest ive just heard of  will anything similar with them are they all men are they all women are they children  matt no children most of them seem to be well off to do folk dressed well  will wealthy men and women and you say youve searched everywhere including the catacombs  matt most catacombs themselves are sealed off weve asked around and theres been no sign of  movement in or out and gods forbid anyone stays in those places 
town	  thats a nasty place to be staying  will it is indeed  orion is there a way that the bastions could organize some kind of gathering of sorts perhaps  a mandatory town meeting where all would have  to gather for maybe  an announcement or something official  matt all the bastions thats near impossible the citys scattered politically enough as it  is people can be rallying whenever theres some sort of force coming against the city but when it  comes to nothing for any particular reason just the investigators take care of it 
town	 themselves  wil he serves the raven queen right hes got the raven queen patch on him  matt yeah  wil this part of town death isnt the worst thing in the world lots of planes other than  ours might be youre a little bit closer than some of the rest of us are were underneath the  mountain you wouldnt happen to know about anyone performing any rituals or maybe opening up lines  of communication that may have been made and disturbed  matt i certainly hope not these sort of communion rituals are sanctified and 
none	 held within  the actual temple to the raven queen itself if anyone is doing any sort of business there is a  very watchful eye over the city anything that is unsanctioned  i can guarantee well know about it  orion may we seek audience with this raven queen  marisha i mean shes a goddess  orion oh shes not here  marisha shes not a queen shes a goddess  matt you can see the two the two bastions are looking at each other with expression of  really  orion were new around here  
none	 matt listen weve talked long enough we got to get back to our posts  marisha oh wait you mentioned investigators  matt there are different people assigned to investigate we were part of the team that was  sent as part of the investigation raid on the velvet cabaret  marisha its not a group of people its just youre an investigator today kind of thing  matt thats part of what we do as bastions aye  marisha gotcha is there anyone else that is part of the investigation team that you think would be  good to 
none	 talk to  matt they wouldnt have any more information than we do no  marisha can i do an insight check on him  matt yeah go for it  marisha 23  matt he seems forthright enough he seems impatient and a little flustered with the fact  that youve been pushing these questions to him but he doesnt  seem to be covering anything necessarily  wil did he tell us where they found the i didnt write this down  liam and lord tyrell factored in how  wil can you tell us where you found 
none	 the body of the merchant lord  matt the body was found in the side alley to the velvet cabaret  will you said wrapped up or just the ones in the river were wrapped up  matt the ones that were found in the river they were wrapped up in blankets whatever put them  aside was not some beast there was some intelligence to this and they were placed  deliberately which means i dont think theres just one thing doing this  will were the blankets the same or were they all different  matt they seemed 
none	 to be different some were just scattered cloths some were tattered sheets some  were bolts of fine material really varied there was no pattern to it  will was anything missing from lord tyrell  matt nothing more than his throat his trachea  liam weve pumped these guys for all theyve got  wil youre all right sorry about that  matt its all right just offer more coin up front next time be well and if you hear  anything find any information come straight to us dont be getting into official business  youre sanctified as 
town	 a slayer but dont make us look bad they step around you guys back out  into the main street  wil velvet cabaret  marisha velvet cabaret  will its close  marisha so we know that this guy while we walk there i was talking we know that this guy is a  demon from the nine hells so he seems to be targeting wealthy people do you think these are  people that tried to get under his control under his servitude and it didnt go his way so he  ended up killing them  wil 
none	 folk dont go into the velvet cabaret unless they got a lot of coin someone like lord tyrell  do we know anything about him does his name ring any bells for us at all  matt roll a history check  wil oh boy laughs it happened again  matt this is unprecedented you are the negapercy right now  wil just telling you im just telling you  matt this is impressive  wil you think it isnt real you think its a thing i make jokes about  matt you take a moment to conjecture where you 
none	 may have heard the name what was the name again  wil oh the guy from battlestar galactica  oh what was his name adama  matt you want to roll a history check  will d20  matt d20 and add your history modifier  will add my history 20 total of 20  matt total is 20 all right youve heard of the city of ankharel its a desert city from a long  ways away but you arent specifically aware of this individual you however kashaw you know  that lord tyrell has come through this city 
none	 a few times in the past year or so youve only been  here a short time yourself but in the time that youve been here youve heard tales of this large  caravan that comes through and it is a parade he usually brings with him a good 13 different carts  that contain all sorts of jewels and materials and tapestries and fine silks and its almost a small  party whenever this is this long walking caravan is brought into the city so you are aware of this  individual youre surprised that the death has be 
none	 kept so hushhush  will and are there rumors of about him bring in anything else anything illicit or is it kind of  what you see is what you get  matt as far as you know no information that has caught your ear per se but the fact that hes  staying in this district who knows  wil folks tend to stay let me try that again folk tend to stay with their own class these  victims are all wealthy folk and they seem to have the velvet cabaret in common its very  likely that 
town	 were dealing with somebody who is rich and powerful  will what does a demon need money for  wil who says hes after money  marisha seems to be after power  liam tyrell was passing through i wonder how many people would notice him gone  here in vasselheim  orion im sure quite a few  marisha and it seems like its no secret when he comes to town  will it was a party every time he showed up  marisha and according to the guards these murders have been going on for the past few 
town	 years  so it seems like whatever were dealing with might have time to plan ahead if hes been aware of the  past few times that tyrell has come through the town and could possibly know the next time hes  coming through  orion and if we could pinpoint when it actually started we know years but actually when then we  can actually narrow it down to the establishments and other things that were established then  wil would there be a place where we could inquire as to some sort of ledger like that when this 
none	 guy  comes in and with the intention of trying to correlate it with when different murders have  happened actually i take that back thorbir doesnt think that deeply thats not the thing  that he wants to do that sounds like a lot of thinking and not a lot of hitting things  liam this killer could be hiding in plain sight  at the cabaret could be an employee there  orion or the owner himself  marisha how long ago did the bastions say that they raided the velvet cabaret  will it was a month 
none	 ago wasnt it  matt it was a few weeks back when the murder occurred yeah  marisha so heres my question do you think he would stick around after it was raided or do you  think hed move on  liam the thing is vanishing upon sight  will and gotten away with it for the last two or three years i dont think he cares much anymore  liam my question is we have three days cabarets the only lead we have how do we draw  this person he or she out  marisha i believe 
town	 it is three days  liam we have three days to collar it  matt you have three days to complete the contract meaning slaying the entity youre  contracted to  will i was going to say that you look like a man who knows wealth  orion yes  liam ive spent time with wealth  will well i never have so i would think maybe if you were a merchant coming into  town very wealthy looking for some adult entertainment  might be a way to bring him out the forefront  orion oh i agree 
none	 i cast alter self on myself and turn myself into an elf  youre halfelf right  liam halfelves  orion ill turn into a halfelf akin to a highborn half elf  matt all right fair enough even in comparison to vax your attire is very nice  marisha does this mean that i should go change clothes  will you were going to go shopping  marisha i was  orion you look okay  marisha thank you  liam lets go i jingle what gold i have in a pouch in front of keyleths face and say 
none	 lets go  shopping come on  wil shopping montage  matt as you guys go out shopping for better looking welltodo attire well go ahead and  take a quick fiveminute break and well return here and as you guys continue to the next step of  your hunt for the rakshasa  wil oh tyrell i just remembered  laughter  wil what a silly thing to forget  liam as the rakshasa bears down on your head  matt last thing engraved on your tombstone yeah quick fiveminute break first off before we get  to that 
none	 guys a big thank you to negihama once again our patron saint of ridiculous gifts who  purchased these sconces to put on the wall  liam theyre legit  marisha arent the sconces awesome  matt they are amazing  marisha the leds change colors  matt reminder every hundred subs were giving away a signed picture and signed fullscale  poster of kits art and for the break the fiveminute break were going to take real fast  we have an awesome video that was presented to us by some of the critters that i think youll also 
none	  appreciate as well so well go ahead roll that and use the potty  and well see you guys in a few minutes  break  matt welcome back i assume well have a liam here in just a moment  orion hes just stealthing  will hes stealthing he rolled a 28  and disappeared  wil i was talking liams ear off during the break about how much i love the dynamic among the three  of you and commiserating about how you feel really naked and exposed when your whole party  isnt together how weird 
none	 that feels to not have everybody together at the same time i think i  kept him from the bathroom  matt oh gotcha thats okay hell arrive when he comes well all awkwardly stare yeah when he  does when he arrives well all just but in the meantime you managed to go back and  liam stealth disadvantage on my next five attacks  laughter  will i love the awkward stare it was great  wil hes actually a very generous dm if he does that i actually make my players roll damage when  they upset

none	 now i cast alter self  matt all right cast and a flash of light you guys all pick up the very very heavy smell of  breakfast ale emanating from the deeply breathing angry dwarf  orion wait vax what was my role in this  liam youre an advisor a financial advisor  orion financial advisor excellent  matt all right you guys make your way to a little bit further north this of this route five  or six blocks until you get the outskirts of the velvet cabaret which based on the description  youve gotten 
dung	 from a few individuals you asked around very easy to find the fancy house of  entertainment it is a twostory building of dark cherry wood with strips of what looks to be black  suede bolted in a pattern along the outside of it it stands out like a sore thumb against the rest  of the architecture but it looks a night club it looks very very gaudy but in a way that the  garishness looks expensive and so you cant really fault it for looking the way it does  wil it looks like cruise ship 
none	 goth club  matt i like that ill take that  will cruise ship goth club  wil thats a thing that exists  will really  matt when are we going to this  wil every year on the jonathan coulton cruise we gather in the cruise ship goth club  will wow  matt joco cruise  will too many jokes  matt i know as you approach the front you can see that there are two bouncers established at the  very front to the left you see a meaty male dragonborn bronze scale with painted face 
none	 scars  he has a very very intense look about him hes thicker hes built like a barrel he sits with  his arms crossed looking angrily out amongst the rest of the folks outside to the other side you  recognize a burlylooking female with short hair and some facial tattoos the siren who you saw  battle in the cauldron apparently works as one of the bouncers of the velvet cabaret  orion i approach right next to vax as we move up scanlan in draconic i go greetings and  salutations friend  matt he gives you 
none	 a look of confusion for a second and leans forward and the dragonborn looks  very intently at you and says back in draconic are you a member  orion not yet we are new to this place my master here is seeking audience with his kind we  were guided to this place this establishment has a high reputation  we wish to inquire how to get inside  matt looks over to the siren siren glances back and whats he saying  and the dragonborn glances over and he says out loud in common now at this point 
none	 hes saying  that theyre looking to come in here and talk to other elvish guys i guess  orion oh not elvish but more people of high society high society here  matt make a persuasion check  orion 21  matt 21 he gives a glance over well if youre not a member you can acquire membership but it  has to approved first by the owner  orion may we seek audience with him to ask or apply or however that goes about  matt let me get his assistant hold on just a second siren  
none	 she gives a look ill be right back she rolls up her sleeves  and steps inside as the door opens  marisha as i see her i turn and face outward  will you know her  marisha no  will okay  matt as the door opens you can already hear  what sounds like soft harp music coming from the  interior and its hard to actually look inside because as you can see there are silks draped  crossed over and in front of the entryway as soon as you step in  a few moments 
dung	 pass eventually the siren returns and you are greeted at the doorway by a dwarf with  very wellgroomed facial hair a beard that comes to a fine point has a little gold ring at the  very bottom that kinks it at the bottom this little poof with makeup on very rosy cheeks and  you can see there is eyeliner around his eyes smile to his face wearing these long white robes  lots of jewelry and the rest of his dark brown hair is pulled into a dual ponytail that runs down  to the middle of 
none	 the back comes to door and immediately says gracious welcome to all of you  ive been told that youre seeking possible membership to our establishment  orion in dwarvish i say thats correct  matt well fantastic then dont leave possible patrons outside and looks off to the two  bouncers and they grumble and step off to the side come in come in follow me and he steps  inside as you guys walk in behind him immediately youre hit with the strong smell of  exotic incense and the cooking of meat mingling with that it has 
none	 this smell of everything good  youve ever smelled mixed into one location  will love the smell of these places  matt the interior is fairly lowlit with what looks like a series of faeriefire lamps dangling  in small lattice cages so it has this light purplishpink glow to the general interior there  are no stools or chairs there are tables that low set and the floor is nearly covered with very  very expensive looking pillows all the patrons are currently sitting crosslegged or laying  around the tables and you can see the clientele is 
none	 very well dressed and very wealthy there is  laughter and conversation theres definitely has a very very different air its like stepping  into a whole different world from what youre used to seeing in vasselheim and you get the feeling  that whoever created this establishment definitely created it to provide a very different experience  for most people who work here which means one it probably makes a really good killing to the small  number of clientele number two it probably isnt very well liked by the people who have been living  here most their 
none	 life as you look around too there are dice games being played there are many  gold pieces being stacked up on tables it appears that theres definitely a lively whats the word  im looking for my brain isnt working gambling arrangement in this place you notice that all the  guards in the inside the bouncers are common sellswords theres no unification to their  adornments or any of their armor and stuff there are a few folks that are looking around keeping  the peace arms crossed they all definitely have weapons visible and theyre just sitting 
none	 there  guarding just like the bouncers were at front of the place  will how many dwarves  matt just the one that let you inside  marisha i reach over and i grab vaxs hand  liam i fold her arm in and walk forward  matt all right  will i think as they move forward i would like to pull thorbir aside and say maybe since were  trying to get membership here you should cover your runes  wil noted  will thank you  wil id like to make a perception check to size 
none	 up the guards around ten  matt well thats a step in the right direction  wil i rolled four times as good as i usually roll  matt looking about they look armored its hard to tell their skill level based on the low light  in here they seem definitely keeping an eye out but you can tell theyve been working here a while  and theyve grown comfortable what you do notice though is a lot of the servers that are walking  around are young men and women dressed in very fine silk robes or gowns 
none	 all have these iron  bands around their neck collars that arent chained to anything but it immediately gives you  this mental image of slavery or some sort of servitude it does not appear that they are  actually in some sort of servitude but the adornment they wear is almost trying to get across  that atmosphere as if thats part of what youre paying for it sickens you a little  wil im going to carry myself and im going to do what i can to give off that im keeping an eye on  this guy 
none	 that im the guy thats how im trying to carry myself  matt okay as you guys you have walked to the center of this room now the dwarf individual who  let you in turns around and with a bit of a bow i would to introduce myself my name is hosin i  am the manager of this fine establishment the velvet cabaret id like to welcome you  liam scanlan of the shorthalts  matt scanlan of the shorthalts where do you hail from ive not heard of them  liam we come from emon i sell 
none	 shoes we sell shoes  marisha yes coralin shorthalt  matt coralin shorthalt  marisha yes pleasure  matt very well well you have interest in membership you say  liam we do were hoping to sample the atmosphere here is there entertainment we heard there was  great entertainment  matt oh yes quite entertainment here at certain hours if you like for now we have more an  atmospheric presentation and he looks over and you can you see that there is small stage off to  the corner there sits a very beautiful elven woman dressed in 
none	 a gold gown that is sleeveless  and hugs to her form very well you can see that it shimmers and little bit of purple fairy light  that is hanging above her and she just this gorgeouslooking silver harp in front of her  shes just plucking away her eyes are closed like shes just caught in the moment and theres  group of people that are sitting around her chatting softly not to be overbearing to the  music but to just be around that atmosphere  orion your wonderful employees mentioned membership wed like to acquire that 
dung	 as well i  assume as well  matt youre saying this to hosin  liam this is thorlaxalux my financial advisor  orion thorlaxalux at your service i bow gracefully  matt make a persuasion roll no deception roll deception roll  orion what is that 16  matt 16 all right the pleasure is mine and its not often that come across elves that have  taken the time to learn the tongue of my folk  orion i know many languages  marisha hes very well traveled very well cultured thats part why we hired him  
none	 orion i was a bit of a shutin as a child all i had were books on languages to read and whatnot  and adventures and what have you  matt well if you are seeking membership you should probably speak with our patron the owner  of this establishment hes currently in a meeting i believe but step with me for a  moment and he leads you to go to the other side of the room and you know all these draped orange  and gold silks that are constantly getting in your way as you push through 
none	 leads you into a doorway  that is covered in these silks you push into the hallway to the right and left theres a door  across the way and two doors down the left and the door at the very end is a really  ornatelooking door with a series of locks that currently unlocked hosin walks up to it and  knocks gently onto it takes a listen ah it appears that he will be available in just a  moment if youd like to sit tight and youre more than welcome to speak  marisha question hosin 
none	 while we wait do you happen to have any wine or ale just while we  wait its been such a long travel  matt but of course  marisha thank you youre so kind  matt he claps his hands and you can see one of the servants that you saw walking with a small  tray enters from the side of the hallway yes  hosin turns the finest wine we have available  for the elven lass right here the servant  immediately darts off averting the eyes a moment passes returns with three glasses of wine 
dung	  looking over you two hands one to each of you and the servant still averting his gaze from the  guests smiles gives a little curtsy and then darts back into the main room  marisha cheers cling  liam i cling and hand my glass to thorbir  marisha i take a sip of mine its very good  wil all right im sipping to keep up the charade  but im not happy about it  matt its definitely an elvish blend which is generally too sweet for your tastes but for what  you were expecting 
none	 its not too bad its serviceable nowhere near strong enough to really  do anything but its not water  wil so as i hand it back to you i sort of mutter wine  laughter  wil giant dwarven air quotes  matt the doorway at the end of the hallway opens up suddenly and as it does a servant walks out  holding a tray that contains a bunch of partiallyeaten fruits and what looks the outer  gristle of some sort of cooked meat and looks at you all awkwardly and steps past and disappears  into 
none	 the other room you hear a voice come down the hallway enter i ask you all to enter you  are to meet me please come sit be comfortable welcome to the velvet cabaret  liam look to thorbir and then look in the room  wil i step into the room  matt as you enter hosin lowers his head and offers his arms at the rest of you to acquiesce  stepping into the room you see once again a room that has a square or rectangular table in the  center that has a series of small 
dung	 platters on it with bits of previously devoured meal and there  are three small cushions on the ground that you see would act as some sort of sitting arrangement  the opposite side of the room has three large purple cushions on which there are two women also  servants that are just lying back comfortably just resting and in the center you see a man  very dark complexion ratty looking crimped dark hair very welltrimmed beard and mustache  ensemble and long black and gold robes very very long sleeves and jewelry adorning every ounce  of 
none	 his hands his fingers you can barely see the actual skin beneath there is just so much jewelry  adorning him he looks up smiling with his elbows near the edge of the table have a seat we are  to talk yes introduce yourselves guests are always welcome but i wish to know who it is that  i am guesting for  liam i seat coralin and have a seat myself and pretending to check out the women in the room i  make a perception check and that is a 16  matt all right what are 
none	 trying to see  liam oh if anything sets off my alarm bells  matt they seem to be lounging and there isnt like fear in their eyes or that they are being  mistreated per se almost like theyre here for atmosphere  liam and the room itself  matt the room itself most of the walls have like a velvety texture to them all the wood has  been covered with some sort of material that has a comfortable almost everything feels like its a  lounging bedroom and thats the aesthetic of a lot of the interior 
dung	 of this location you cannot  quite see the source of the light in the room it almost feels like theres an indirect lighting  accoutrement across the ceiling whatever the source of lighting is its being spread across  the top it gives this sort of dark intimate feel to this current room at least as he gestures out  to the rest of you to sit i fear there are only three seats but i assume that your accompaniment  are accustomed to standing anyway so do not worry very good now you say you come for  
none	 membership membership does not come cheap membership does not come to anyone we have  a certain level of clientele we wish to keep because in keeping this it is easy enough for us to  consider it very how do i say exquisite  marisha im sorry before we go on what was your name i dont believe i caught it  matt i did not catch your name either  marisha oh im sorry i am coralin coralin shorthalt  matt coralin shorthalt  marisha of the emon shorthalts  matt takes your hand and leans forward and 
none	 gives you this ginger kiss to edge of your fingers  yeah there is a slimyish presence but not too aggressive just a very welltrained type of  dealing with guests  marisha i subversively wipe it on my robes  matt my name is vince cyinnor and i am the owner of this house of joy and pleasure  liam im the lucky man who married her my name is scanlan of the shorthalts were in from emon  and reputation of this establishment is well known within all parts of the walls were looking to  possibly become 
none	 members here we hear the entertainment is topnotch and we hear that  business happens within these walls but im not convinced im hoping to stay for an hour to see  what you have to offer when i find i like a place i stay for a long time and leave a lot of  money id just like a little taste  matt make a deception check  liam using my last luck of the day thats better 15  matt 15 hosin if you dont mind and the door closes behind you guys well scanlan shorthalt  
none	 what may i ask business do you run that gives you the liquid assets to think that you can walk  and rub shoulders among such astute clientele you are welldressed i see and wellversed in  conversation but have not heard of you before and i have very acute ears for people of such heritage  in this city  liam we hail from emon were not very flashy we certainly dont do much in public in emon i  prefer to make my money and enjoy my money and i dont believe in ostentation  matt why have 
none	 you come to this establishment i am made of ostentation for i do not fear what  people judge or think here do what you like  liam dont get me wrong i enjoy the form of a beautiful woman as much as the next man  matt why limit yourself  liam who said i do  matt even this one here while his appearance may be rough im certain that under certain  circumstances he could be persuaded to prove his weight in more than gold and weaponry  marisha mr cyinnor i think it is best that 
none	 you do not make presumptions  on our relationship and dealings  liam my wife and i are businessmen and what we hear is that this is where business happens  matt business does happen here yes quite a bit of interesting business  marisha and we are very interested in all of those interesting businesses  matt from what i hear as my assistant has told me your business is shoes tell me why would the  business of shoes require such an ostentatious location for business  liam the shoes are the public face but the well runs 
none	 deep  matt we get to the meat of the matter eh so shoes is but an appearance what is your business  aside from cobbling mr shorthalt  liam i know my way around poison and i hear you have the rarest of breeds here i have come to  spend some money to satisfy my clients  matt make a deception check  liam 15 again  matt what was it  liam 15 again  matt poisons so you supply to what kingkillers supply to sellswords you apply  them to your own weapons you realize this 
none	 city is very very tightknit when it comes to these sorts of  industries although i know you would think possibly to find it here i guarantee you what we deal with  here has nothing to do with slitting of throats  liam im not looking to sell im looking to buy  matt i will tell you one thing that i am interested in buying im interested in buying information  im interested in buying loyalty im interested in buying trust since youve walked into this  room there has been an air of something not right about 
none	 you and through this conversation i have  come to believe that perhaps youre not telling me the truth now i will ask of you this moment  whoever you may be shorthalt or not but this entire facility is very well paid to make sure  that should you try anything funny you wont get but two steps before the heads leave your  shoulders so lets be frank here who are you why are you here  marisha mr vince lets not play coy i am sure you have dealt with many a powerful client in  your 
none	 day and i am sure that it is not unfamiliar to you that many powerful clients  have many deep secrets  orion as she finishes that i dispel alter self  matt okay as your actual dragonborn appearance restores itself he sits back  orion my apologies i am tiberius stormwind yes wind  will i can never get it right  orion i merely dispelled this to show you that earning your trust is in our best interests i do  not wish to deceive  matt then perhaps you should have walked in this form when you 
town	 first arrived  orion many people dont take kindly to a red dragonborn by the way i just thought it was best  were in a new town and it was standard protocol whenever we visit a new town my apologies  matt well one person has come clean what about this one what is your business here  will my business here is the same as theirs were here in the long run to help you  matt what is to help me you have not told me what your business is  liam were here to stop a 
none	 murderer  matt explain  liam bodies have been showing up outside this building multiple bodies were not going to get  into the details but weve been sent here to stop that from happening any further  orion were fairly sure you know of this  liam look at this guy does he look like hes fucking around  wil he winks at him  matt the force of the wink itself is intense enough to the point where he physically shudders  and leans back a few inches  liam now you must be aware of this problem 
none	 cant be a surprise to you people are starting to  take notice in this city this was inevitable  will do you still have lord tyrells possessions  matt this is about lord tyrell we do have his possessions they have been investigated our  establishment has already been investigated the bastions were very thorough and we have been  found absolved of any sort of involvement  marisha we are not bastions and we are not here to accuse and we are not here to investigate your  establishment  matt interesting you come in here and lie 
none	 it seems to me exactly what youre doing now are  you coming to ask questions to see what involvement we have answers weve already told  everything to anyone else we have no involvement i dont know what youre talking about this is  ridiculous and i may have to ask you to leave  marisha hes shutting down someone do something quick  liam insight check insight check balls  wil i will also make an insight check  marisha can i do that as well  laughter  matt what did you get  marisha were all

none	 planet to balance the math to save you all to prevent the center of the planet from collapsing  and taking us all with it youre welcome  liam shes in new zealand the other side of the earth  matt all right so as youre all taking this moment to yourself its hard to read it seems  like hes very thorough and offended by this circumstance you glean that there is a  nervousness and there are droplets of sweat across his brow and his brusqeness does show a  bit of fear in his eyes  marisha 
none	 about this time i go fwoosh and i cast my wind spell and i slam the doors behind us and i  slam the shutters and turn out all the lights did you say there was candlelight or did you say  there was weird indirect lighting  matt yeah indirect lighting you dont quite know where the source is coming from the door was  already closed behind you hosin closed it but as the wind comes out all the silks blow against the  wall pillows are lobbed to the sides both of the women in there yelps 
none	 and pull back against walls  trying to keep out of the circumstance and you can see vince has begun to stand up and his hair  blown back what is the meaning of this  marisha now im sorry i didnt mean to do that i sometimes get a little out of control but  remain calm all right jesus remain calm  orion you calm down  marisha im sorry im trying to remain calm too  will doing a great job  marisha thank you okay  matt persuasion check  marisha damn it  liam whos

none	 and back to the dragonborn the dwarf  marisha and i say and whatever weapon you were about to brandish  youd best wise to leave it be  matt you realize you may have just alerted pretty much the entirety of my guard to this  establishment theyll be descending on this room soon  marisha and you realize that this is only because of your doing  matt he sits down on the cushion again  wil and thorbir looks at him and goes okay and pulls his greataxe out and leans on his greataxe  orion i

none	 dwarven face staring through the passage that then  slams the door shut quickly and you hear footsteps  marisha and will was that hosin  matt that was hosin yeah  marisha fucking hosin  will thanks a lot hoser  matt hes shaking his head now the blade there as you hear the feet running off now  marisha im going something tiny and fast whats tiny and fast  liam mouse rat  marisha im going rat and im going after hosin  matt all right you guys watch as keyleth all of a sudden grasps the 
none	 side of her armor and then her  form shrinks down to a tiny rat then darts underneath  liam im going to bap this guy in the head im going to just flip the blade and strike him across  the forehead  orion as i see her do this i open the scroll of polymorph i do polymorph on myself and i turn  myself into a gadfly and follow  matt okay the scroll is consumed and gone you turn into a fly and follow as well two of your  party members just shrunk and vanished

none	 that  matt okay so mark down jeweled dagger in your equipment  will i want to search him i want to see if he has anything on him in his pockets anything  matt okay as you are beginning to go through his body you guys have rushed beneath and as you can  see the dwarf hosin is walking down the hallway really quickly with his robes open  orion as a gadfly can i really quickly buzz in front of him  matt you pull underneath because you had to go underneath the door to make it 
none	 into the hallway  you see him hes about 15 feet away and as hes walking hes looking about very nervously hes  seen one of the guards is approaching and he looks back over and sees the rat scurrying down  the hallway  orion how far away is he from me  matt hes about 20 feet  orion how far away is the guard in front of him  matt you know what let me go ahead and pull this up itll give a good indicator of the  circumstance here  marisha he does what  
none	 orion oh god we have a map  liam gentlemen we need to move  orion okay so hes right there  liam mama cass what have you found  matt all right you guys are currently inspecting him at the moment  as you guys are rushing through  orion oh so im within 20 feet of him whatever  matt actually no hed be back here hes just rushing past so hes 20 to 25 feet from you  orion okay ah im going to dispel polymorph and im going to cast silence in front of him im 
none	  going to silence him  matt okay all right so youre using him as the source  orion yes  matt okay so as you unpolymorph he looks over his shoulder and sees you take this form you go  ahead and cast silence which has an opposition what level spell is that 2ndlevel  orion yes i believe so  matt okay cool so that creates a sphere of a 20foot radius of silence here so he goes and he  does like a hand motion nothing happens frustrated he continues to run im going to have  
none	 you guys roll initiative  marisha fucking shit 17  matt 17  orion sorry what is that 17  matt 17 and 17 all right so you guys will both be going first but before we finish that as you  guys are searching the body you hear all of a sudden the sound of some sort of scuffle a flash  of some sort of energy in the hallway thats muffled between the doorway and footsteps also  happening as youre just starting to get through his pockets you start hearing some sort of a  scuffle outside 
none	 of the room  wil im gone  will me too  matt so ill have you guys roll initiative as well  wil four  matt all right  liam not great nine  will 11  wil theres 20 faces on this so i mean look right it can happen i know that its possible  ive done it in my life  matt all right so as you guys are turning well get to your turn in a moment tiberius and  keyleth youre up first  marisha are we at the same time i guess ill

none	 because hes not a person hes not a person i shouldve fucking done grasping vine  goddamn it all right  matt do you want to move or are you staying where you are  marisha yeah ill follow after his ass  matt all right you can get up to pretty much right adjacent to him if you want  all right tiberius  orion im going to cast telekinesis and grab him that way  matt okay so from where you are you go ahead and you create your telekinetic force you rush out  and the telekinetic 
none	 force seems to have no effect on the dwarfs form  orion its the rakshasa thats him  matt do you move  orion no i yell at you dont chase him  marisha and i go what  matt which you dont hear because she goes no audio  marisha yeah im in the silent bubble  matt yeah there is currently no sound coming from the center of that area  orion but she can hear me  matt she can hear you  orion and im not that far you heard me the other way the other 
none	 way and i move in the room  with these guys  matt okay as you guys turn you see tiberius come rushing into the room  orion the rakshasa nothing works on him and i think thats not normal  liam youre speaking draconian  orion yes sorry rakshasa i believe the dwarf is the rakshasa i cast many things and keyleth  is in there nothing hit him  liam you left her with him i shove past him and go straight through the door  wil you ran away from the target ugh i stomp past him 
none	 in my dwarfy stomps  matt hosin gets just out of the sphere of silence and then angrily does a motion  with a hand and then  shouting  marisha i knew it was going to happen  matt thatll bring us next to brother kash kashaw what do you want to do  will i want to go back eight moves and catch the thing i think what were going to have to do now  is find out where he is lets locate creature again if we can  matt okay this is during your turn is 
none	 there anything you want to do  will can we locate creature see how close he is  matt how long does it take to cast locate creature  will i believe it is one action  matt okay so you can do that so you mark that off as another casting of that spell  will okay  matt as you rush out into the hallway and see that its vanishing you cast the spell for a  second you can see the direction of the creature is roughly ahead of you and you also see a door on 
none	  the opposite side this righthand door open and close  marisha he goes invisible hes not teleporting hes just invisible thats a big thing  will yeah hes here hes still here we cant see him  matt you still have 15 feet of movement if you want to move forward  will yeah i would like to move forward  matt okay so youll get up to that point with your turn and you gather that thats the  direction of him and that you know thats where its going  will i know where its going okay 
none	 so we saw the door shut thats where he is lets go  liam dont run blindly in there hold on  matt vax youre up  liam im going to run just up past keyleth im going to look at her as i pass not bad keep  going stop there and now im going to try to sense traps  matt at this point there okay so you can get up to here if youre going to use an action as  well to dash  liam if i use thats fine yeah  matt okay as you 
none	 go to talk to her no words come out  orion can i see whats going on  matt no youre in the other room still everyone darted out and youre making your way  out so go ahead and make a perception check  liam okay 21  matt 21 glancing about the room there doesnt appear to be anything that catches you as a trap  this hallway is fairly oftentraversed by the clientele of this establishment and nothing seems  dangerous that would be difficult to put in the middle of a place and still run a 
none	 business  liam okay i look at kash and keyleth and say are we out of initiative  were still in initiative  matt were still in initiative currently for the moment  just for the sake of the pacing on this  wil im going as far as i can down the hall toward the direction of the bad guy  matt okay that gets you to about there cool that ends that turn at which point three of the  bouncers then start pushing through the silks one of them pushes his way here this one pushes  
none	 aside and they come out weapons drawn seeing all of you there and one of them goes no audio  thats their turn but it looks like theyre ready to jump into some sort of combat circumstance  that brings us to the top of the round tiberius youre up  orion whered you say the guards came from  matt they came from the main room where the silks are that separate the hallway from the main  area and you start hearing people shouting and some slight yelps and screams from the other  roompeople who seem freaked 
none	 out by the sudden rise in energy  orion what was that guys name lohan  wil hosin  orion hosin  wil the dwarf is hosin the other guy is vince  orion i just disperse silence and before i go out i turn into hosin alter self  matt okay so you use your action to cast alter self you take hosins form step out closing the  door behind you  orion how did he sound again  matt how did he sound  orion i dont remember  marisha hes a dwarf  will he was 
none	 scottish but fancy scottish  liam hes glam rock glam rock  orion oh right right whats all this noise out here  what are you bothering my friends for guards  matt the guards look over confused and we heard there was a  orion everythings fine these are friends get on with your business get back on patrol make  sure nothing happens or ill have your heads  matt make a deception check  marisha oh come on tiberius  orion 28  matt the guards look at each other all right but if anything happens again 
none	 theres a problem  let us know well be at the ready they sheathe their weapons and look untrustingly to the rest of  your group with your weapons currently drawn and step back  orion go on get out  matt they disappear back into the main room and they start calming down some of the other patrons  who are starting to peek around them trying to see whats going on the action some look smiling  and curious to see whats happening and theyre go back to your tables its fine theres no  problem and they 
none	 disperse the energy  liam not bad tiberius  marisha with that i continue with the charade and loop my arm around vax and say shall we go  into that room  liam just a moment dear pull out the same poisoned blade and start walking down that hall a  little further and i want to see if i sense any traps further ahead  matt okay to about there make a perception check  liam natural 20  wil and balance was restored to the universe oh god dont do that come on  matt put it 
none	 away watch as the dice just like turns to dust  wil its the end of raiders  matt exactly you glance about the room as youre walking forward carefully looking at the  floorboards looking at the tapestries on the walls looking for anything that would be out of  sorts and your eyes very keen to find anything out of the ordinary the room thankfully does not  appear to have anything specifically trapped it seems fairly safe  liam oh okay and those are doors up there  matt yeah door to the right door to the 
none	 left  liam would that check include the doors themselves  matt i would say with a natural 20 yes the doors both also seem to be functional doors not  designed with any sort of trap attached  liam all right pressing my ear to the door on my left  matt okay listen to it perception roll  liam so many six  matt seems fairly quiet  orion if weve stopped pursuing does that take us out of initiative  matt you guys are not you guys are not currently in initiative because youre not in the 
none	 thick of  battle you managed to disperse the conflict  liam i want to do it at the other door as well  matt all right you step to the other door you guys want to do anything else while youre waiting  on him  wil im just going to come i want to get as close to him as i can and im ready for a fight  marisha yeah i follow  orion thorbir do you have an extra sword or arm on you perhaps a shortsword  wil i give him the jeweled dagger  
none	 liam that ones a 19  matt 19 listening you hear what sounds like a slight creak sound some sort of a scooting of  wood on wood and then silence  liam kick in the door hard as i can  matt okay make a strength roll this would be straight strength  liam wait thats the wrong guy 12 14  orion as hes doing that im going to drink a potion of frost giant strength  matt okay you slam your foot into the door oh that was the foot that you just got healed oh  
none	 thats going to bruise thats really going to bruise  liam keyleth coralin darling could you come up here please  marisha yes did you stub your toe darling  liam yeah i think i want to get this door open quickly please  wil im going to hit the door with my axe  matt okay go for it and roll what did you roll  liam a one  marisha no way its a lie if it wasnt live no one would believe it  wil i rolled a one because it is what i do  matt 
none	 im going to test this theory im going to trade you for now and im going to leave you  with that dice and see if it has any impact whatsoever  liam you have to throw it into the fire mr frodo  wil the curse doesnt care about which die is rolled  matt which is very possible but there needs to be  liam this is like science class  marisha maybe its because that dice was in the vicinity of matts hair youll be good  matt all right  wil so how much damage do 
none	 i take for some reason  matt so as you pull back the axe you actually swing wildly backward nearly hitting vax in the  process you have to dodge out of the way as the axe embeds itself into the wood behind you  wil ugh again  matt axe is stuck  liam i slap myself on the forehead and go ugh pull out thieves pick and start on the lock  matt okay you unclasp as you do you feel your throat seize suddenly as the cold liquid tends to  freeze up what is normally a 
none	 very warm and very firebreeding interior to your throat and it  thaws slowly and as you exhale you can see the mist and suddenly your muscles pulse with energy  and you feel like your physical form is embodied strength far more than youve ever felt in your  body before  orion with his jeweled dagger i take out my dagger i feel great  liam the freshmaker  matt theres now the angriest dwarf right now clutching two daggers as you get down with your  thieves tools  liam yeah lets try to leave the room 
none	 thats better thats a 24  matt all right the door swings open without issue its one of the easier jobs youve had  liam i shouldve done that in the first place  marisha yeah shouldve beat it down and then  matt you push open the door and find your way into what looks like a very welladorned bedroom  there is a small table on the side where there are some books stacked up theres a dresser on the  far end thats closed there is a canopy bed set up there is a small endtable on 
none	 the side and  the rest of the room has a nice circular rug thats thrown across the center and there are no  windows currently to this room  liam i turn my head to everyone and just mouth the words and perception check the room  marisha can i perception check as well  liam 24  marisha can i just look to see i want to just meditate and what did you just roll 24  liam 24  marisha i want to see if i see any movements or brushes of cloth or anything like that 
none	  matt okay  marisha 19 not as good as vax  matt all right  wil how long does it take me to pull the axe out of the wall and how far into yakety sax does the  soundtrack get while im up there and with the foot and then im jumping on it and trying to pull  it down  matt were currently hitting the one minute 15 second mark havent quite pulled it out of the  wood yet  wil okay good and my little legs are kicking underneath me while i pull it 
none	 down cursing in  dwarven  liam they call me benny benny hill  matt do you wish to enter the room  will i dont actually because of all the sound i wish to turn my back to the room and guard the  hallway while everybody else is inside checking out the room  matt okay youre keeping an eye out and you do see that theres one of the guards just to the  side whos just keeping an eye looking over carefully you guys make a perception check  looking around the room you see there 
none	 is no movement there are no curtains on the walls  there is the rug and most everything else in here seems to be perfectly still you catch what looks  like a little bit of movement of the canopy bed the material thats on top theres a slight sway  to it that comes to stillness you just barely catch with your keen halfelven eye  liam i would like to run up the bed and stab up both hands clicking the boots of haste  matt okay bam click the boots of haste you run and charge up 
none	 into the bed and stab upward  into the canopy the material is torn asunder this very fine probably imported silk is carved  into three separate ribbons and falls gently onto the cushion of the bed proper revealing the  hardwood ceiling above you  liam im going to check the ceiling theres a lot of perception im all out of luck thats no  good thats a 14  matt 14 looking about its solid wood you can move your fingers along and youre standing on the  bed you can just get it within reach and feeling 
none	 along the board its all pretty solid  marisha i want to make myself soccer field goalie this stuff with the door in the door frame just  really trying to see if i can see any brush of dust or movement  matt okay keeping an eye out you pull your axe free into the hallway door in front of you not a  lot of strength you pull it out and try the best you can to save some grace  will well done yeah that was graceful  liam i motion tiberius over  orion should i 
none	 do a perception on that nope  matt that ceiling looks pretty solid  will can i turn saving my back to the door i turn over i do a perception check  matt go for it you step over you glance past keyleth  will oh my god one  wil stop trying to steal my thing you guys  matt you glance over and youre more distracted by the fact that keyleth is doing this awkward  field goal thing in the door to you for no reason and you forget  what you were in the middle 
none	 of doing  marisha im trying to make myself big  matt there appears to be no exit from the ceiling  wil can i enter the room  matt you may you push past the confused cleric  wil okay so i look around i look at the rug i sigh heavily and i pull the rug  matt you pull the rug revealing a wooden floor plain slats  marisha you thought that was going to be good  will with a point too  matt you were never a fan of elves or halfelves before but this 
none	 ones really starting to dig into  you a little  wil ill make a perception check because we could total up all my rolls and id have five  liam come on hey  wil look at that thats actually better 20  matt 20 you pull the rug back theres nothing there and you look about at the rest of the folks  with a heavy sigh but the rug was on the right track everyone was keeping high looking beneath  the bed you can see what looks to be in the shadow some little bit of 
none	 elevated wood that  catches your attention  wil i just under the bed  orion oh ill motion over there  liam were not silenced right so im yanking off any fancy clothes i have on and im pulling my  cloak of elvenkind out im putting it over and i spider under the bed and check it for traps  marisha i pick up his clothes and i put them in the bag of holding  will oh my god shes folding the clothes were in the middle of this  and shes folding the clothes  marisha 
none	 they might come in handy later  liam 25 for looking for traps  matt okay well its a good thing you rolled high enough perception because as you spider  underneath your first hand goes underneath and you nearly tumble and you catch yourself there is  a fivefootwide hole in the ground right beneath this bed and as you catch yourself you can feel  a little bit of wind slowly drifting up from underneath theres some sort of airflow coming up  from underneath this bed where this hole is and you feel over and you can 
none	 see that little bit of  wood that you saw looking forward is the top of a makeshift ladder that is currently fastened to the  side of this tunnel that disappears beneath the room  liam is there dim light down there  matt it is pitch black you can see with the dim light from your lowlight vision a little ways  into it about 20 or so feet from the angle youre at because youre not looking directly in and  even just glancing over the side it continues down for quite a while  will and 
dung	 its big enough to fit all of us if we wanted to go  matt independently yes one person would go down it would be single file of course because  its a tight tunnel  will only one way to go right  liam you can see in pitch black right  wil i have darkvision 60 feet  liam is that dim or dark  wil dark  matt darkvision you can see within a short distance of pitch black and then a larger distance at  low light so yeah  wil ill go  matt all 
none	 right so well put in order here whos going down next all right and after vax  marisha ill follow my husband  matt keyleth thats weird tiberius  orion before we go down im going to take off my outer no i cant take off anything because  thats all my gear never mind i dont do that but before we go down i cast stoneskin on myself  i cast that right now  matt okay as your form shimmers for a second and you see you notice this too kashaw his scales  almost seem to protrude 
none	 into earthy spikes and then form and solidify almost like his body  becomes its own suit of armor  will okay thats cool  orion even though im still a dwarf though  will im going to go but im going to cast freedom of movement  on myself before i go down there  matt okay as you do even with the encumbrance of the armor youre wearing you feel like your  form is a little more agile and youre ready for anything that might try and stop your passage you  guys begin making your way 
none	 down with thorbir leading the way you descend for a good three to  four minutes you gather probably a hundred feet or more down rung by rung and there are a few  that you reach that are a little rickety about a hundred feet down one hits your foot and snaps  but you manage to catch yourself on it but you get the feeling this ladder is probably not meant  to hold someone of your heavy physical form  wil largesse  matt largesse you could use yes one by one you make your way down 
dung	 until eventually youre  you begin to see towards the edge of your darkvision floor finally begins to appear and rise  towards you you step off the ladder into what appears to be a small circular area that leads  into another tenfootbytenfoot tunnel ten by 15 foot up and continues forward this is very  natural carved earth its not smoothed stone it just looks like a tunnel  that was mined out of the floor  will is it still dark  matt it is still dark there is no light source currently  and you all 
none	 eventually make your way down  will is there anything loose down there that i can grab a hold of  matt you cant see anything mr human you are in pitchblack darkness  will well thats why im wondering if i feel around underneath me to try to find some kind do  i find a loose stone do i find a pebble can i find anything to grab  matt reach down yeah you manage to find a couple of small stones  orion as hes milling about light  will thats what i was going to do 
none	 but he beat me to it thank you  matt so you reach down and you find a stone you pick it up you begrudgingly grab your holy  symbol and as you begin to recite your cantrip incantation a flash of white light comes gleaming  off the top of the dragonborn sorcerers staff  orion dagger because i have two daggers in my hands  matt thats true one of the daggers is now glowing the jeweled one twice as pretty when  its emanating torchlight  will nice thanks for the warning by the way  orion 
dung	 sorry i usually just do it when its dark  wil this tunnel goes in just one direction  matt one direction  wil im walking down the tunnel  matt okay so well say for the sake of marching order who all is going in after thorbir  in what order  will ill go next  matt all right following thorbir  liam ill go behind kash  will i dont need this at all but i just wanted to play with it thats me right there  orion ill follow ill keep on thorbirs six  matt 
none	 okay  orion ill stay 15 feet behind him  matt 15 feet behind all right and keyleth you continue up that way all right so thatll be the  marching order  wil so ive got my axe out and may i make a perception check to see what i see to just see if  i can pick up footprints or motion or whatever  matt this would be more tracking if youre looking for footprints so thatd be wisdom  wil okay just a straight wisdom  matt survival  wil survival hang on not my system 
none	 eight  matt eight okay its hard to tell it looks like this area is not heavily traversed and what  little sign of footprints there are scattered enough that its hard to make out a specific  print but i mean they have been traveled before  liam im looking over thorbirs head and looking for traps as he walks from behind 22  matt 22 all right as you guys are walking forward and going through this you get about 40  feet forward before you catch that there is a slight divot a small drop in the 
none	 dirt and one  looks like a section of intentionally placed plate of some kind  liam wait a tick im going to go up to the edge of it and try to inspect it and see if i can find  a trigger or see how it works six and that is what is that perception  matt are you checking to see how it works  liam i want to see if i can disarm  matt to disarm it okay that would be with your thieves tools so this would be a dexterity plus  your thieves 
none	 tools so plus seven  liam thats a 19  matt 19 okay as you go to the plate you stop and look up at the walls to the side and to each  side of the wall you can see these tiny little holes these little quartersized  goldpiecesized tunnels bored multiple places on both sides of this wall and you take the plate  you realize this is a pressure platebased trap and taking one dagger you slightly lift it the  second one you eventually find beneath where the trigger apparatus is and you gingerly cut each 
none	  part of these springloaded triggers until eventually the plate rises more and more and more  and you remove the last bit the plate tips over and the trap itself is disarmed  will nice work  orion i mean well done rogue  wil so i keep going down i want to hit a thing  matt all righty  wil thats not a wall  matt there is that all right pushing forward continuing for another 3040 feet do you want to  check traps again  liam again 12  matt 12 okay pushing forward for 
none	 a period of time there doesnt appear to be any change there  are no more divots youre keeping a very close eye for the traps and as youre walking forward  with your axe as youre stepping forward you get this weird tickle across your nose like a spider  web of some kind that catches you and you instinctively reach up and brush it away from your  nose as your finger presses against it its much sturdier than a spider web its a metallic wire  and as you push away tink you hear that slight noise 
none	 tiberius behind you you hear a grinding  of stone and a loud slam sounds like something extremely heavy just dropped behind you  marisha run  matt you guys glance over your shoulder and you see what looks to be a fairly rounded boulder  orion i dispel alter self immediately so i have longerass legs  matt well alter self is gone if youre casting stoneskin because thats a concentration spell  oh that but that only carries it for a few rounds its been a longer time than that  orion its been 15 minutes time has 
none	 passed never mind i dont do shit  matt but yeah dont worry about that but the stone boulder just  marisha indiana jones motherfuckers  matt picking up speed with the slow decline of this room all of you guys what are you doing  all run  matt youre bolting forward  orion i cast fly on myself and fly  matt you cast fly pushing forward and you guys get a little speed but youve noticed the  boulders started to gather steam as it continues down and the pathway you guys are running is  going 
none	 at a heavier and heavier decline as you push forward  orion oh as im flying i turn around with my ring and i cast slow on the boulder  matt okay go ahead and make a actually no this is interesting let me see if slow would have  a direct effect on this boulder thats something that happens right now that i didnt consider i  love when that happens unfortunately it is not a creature and actually it affects the physical  metabolism and muscle use of an individual this is just a solid structured object as 
none	 you release  the spell you see the air around it poof and drift a little slower and the boulder seems to  stutter for a moment but continues to push forward that was your action  orion damn it  liam i would like to cast all of my spells in succession for the next ten minutes  matt i assume youre going full sprint okay so pushing forward you all push forward tiberius  who has stopped to turn around and cast the spell is not at a full dash so he trails behind the  boulder is 
none	 currently gaining on tiberius  orion i gandalf it  matt so you turn around youre continuing to fly forward so you guys just turn to push forward  tiberius the boulder is nearly upon you now what are you going to do  orion oh awesome is it at least ten to 15 feet away from me  matt it is about ten to five feet away from you you can see it cresting  orion sweet as im now frustrated i cast a 5thlevel spell and i will cast my obelisk of  iron three in a row 
none	 behind me  matt okay all right you burned that spell all of a sudden the room behind you out of the  stone pockets of iron ore or whatever material is beneath the earth behind you is brought together  into a liquid mass and then shoots up in the center of the hallway behind you with each one of  these pillars slamming into the wall you guys hear these three multiple explosions behind you  and for a brief second you fear the worst for tiberius current status immediately following  that you hear the impact of 
none	 stone against iron and you see the obelisks bend with this horrible  creaking sound  marisha keep running  orion that should stop it right there  marisha i dont know  matt the sound of the rolling has stopped  marisha i still dont trust it lets just all get out of this hole  orion i keep gandalfing  marisha it could give way at any moment  liam lets walk shall we walk i think we should walk  wil i like to walk  matt okay you guys continue moving forward the decline getting a 
none	 little more difficult to  traverse as your feel yourselves now having to feel your arms across the wall or use it for  balance to make sure you dont just fall also the moisture in the air begins to grow more and  more thick some source of liquid some point down in the future has permeated what was originally  dusty dry air with liquid of some kind and the air itself grows more and more rancid in scent it  smells like refuse or rot its hard to describe and its old its musky its terrible and 
none	 it  grows stronger the farther you go as you continue pushing forward you also feel that the dusty  ground is becoming more and more mudlike  wil is it making my hair poof out and look stupid  matt a little bit yeah you spent all morning treating it and its undoing everything you did  wil this is why i lived in the mountains  will is there any light any light source theres no natural light were not walking  towards any type of light  matt its just a tunnel into darkness right now  
none	 marisha does there appear to be any type of plant life  matt from what you can tell there is no plant life at all whatsoever the moisture gathered on  the walls you can now see are dripping the condensation has given this tunnel more of a  mineralpocketed look and the ground is getting more sludgy with each step  wil i want to make a im sorry youre not done  marisha i was just going to ask are the walls stone or chiseledout rock  matt it feels like its chiseledout hard earth that has been 
dung	 packed and supported with either  small wooden things that are inset to make sure it doesnt collapse at some point a lot of that has  either fallen through  will so it could collapse at any time  matt well if you do any severe damage to its structure it would probably be a bad idea  marisha right like drop a boulder down it  matt its not a mine shaft  marisha what were you going to say  wil i would like to make a you tell me what check it is what i want 
none	 to do is to look down  into this thick mud stuff what im looking for are tracks and if i do well enough i want to see  if i can get a sense of how fast the thing was going has it slowed down because its  comfortable or is it still running  matt okay make another survival check  wil so im underground  matt actually as a dwarf ill give you advantage on that so roll again that makes sense this is  your place  liam well the higher one was four the lower 
none	 one was a one  will the higher one was a four  wil remember what i told you about the wheaton dice curse im sorry because no one will believe  me no one ever believes me  marisha hes been taking pictures of all his fails so everyone believes it  will at this point id be amazed that he hasnt helped us in any way shape or form and cast a  perception check of my own  matt sure  will there we go so lets see we are at 21  matt 21 okay  
none	 will you are useless for the love of god  matt as a preexisting member of the slayers take and the man who was currently set to be the  leader of your group youre beginning to wonder if this guild is the kind of thing you really want  to be joining at this point  wil i havent been in a fight yet  matt true but looking down you can see there are no tracks actually this line has not been  traversed in quite some time and the smoothness of it says that whatever came through 
none	 here did not  leave any footprints  will at all  matt no also as you guys continue you reach a point where especially with your heavy armor go  ahead and make a dexterity saving throw  marisha oh no  liam you got this  will ten so wait 13  matt 13 okay youre stepping forward keeping an eye out and you look back at the group and  take a step and your foot slips out from under you smack you hit the slime and begin to slide  down the tunnel as part of 
none	 the decline you guys watch as your cleric gooniesstyle slide vanishes  into the darkness  will its our time its our time down here  wil hey you guys  matt kashaw has vanished into the darkness and you hear screams  will screams  orion as i see this happening i run over and go like this looks like a lot of fun  matt as you lunge through the air because youre flying still  orion oh has ten minutes passed i thought ten minutes it only lasts for like ten minutes  matt oh then yeah 
none	 its faded so you just slide after  orion yeah i go this looks like a lot of fun and i go and i slide  matt tiberius slides after body first across the slime  marisha and then i see tiberius go and i go whoops and i go too  matt all right three of your party have just vanished into the darkness hoping that fate will  take them to some place of pillows and feathers  liam i think id rather walk as long as i can  wil i think im with you  matt 
none	 all right you guys both make dexterity saving throws  wil 16  liam 16  matt wow you manage to slowly make your way down this tunnel almost whats that  orion my dex was 18 by the way  matt it doesnt matter you jumped into this you intentionally fell  liam we cant even hear you anymore youre miles away  matt yeah you guys slowly begin to make your way down the tunnel as you cant even hear them  anymore you guys one after another sliding down the slide and grime going past you you 
none	 smell in  the air what smells like vegetable matter thats been long long falling in compost along with  what smells like rancid feces mixed with mold its this terrible continuously growing scent  orion i put up my nose scales  matt until eventually out of the darkness because youre ahead of everyone youre outside  of the range of his light spell the slime stops and theres just air  liam hey you guys  matt and a few moments of this air rushing past you as youre immediately stopped with a wet sound  as you 
none	 impact hard into some sort of heavy spongy matter thankfully because its spongy you only  suffer four points of damage so you can mark that somewhere on the sheet mainly just from the way  you landed and your armor sticks into where the plates are and just the impact was bad for your  body but youre now in darkness looking up sitting on what feels like youre on some sort of  strange compost heap looking up you see in the darkness this small light begin to appear and you  see this dragonborn  orion im 
none	 laughing by the way  will can i try to move since i hear him laughing can i try to move out of the way  matt you roll out of the way as the two of you scream down with the light that now shines you  can see this is a cylindrical cistern of some kind it is a tunnel that is very tall and you  both impact into the same heap  liam shitters full  orion as we land i look around oh that was a lot of fun i cast prestidigitation three times in 
none	  a row and clean us all up  matt you try and clean what you can but you guys are like knee to nearly waist deep as you get up  and move around  orion or at least our faces  matt your faces are clean  will what a wonderful smell youve discovered  matt and its a terrible smell this room is quite honestly a mixture of longrotting food of  dried vegetation that has been discarded here for whatever reason a lot of its hay and thatch that  has been just rotting and molding 
none	 for god knows how many years and quite honestly feces from  some indeterminate entity  marisha i use my druidcraft to take out some of my sage and light it  and spread some of my sage around  orion youre making it worse now its smoky and smells prestidigitate it out of my face  matt as you guys are doing this you guys are making your way down the tunnel and you have a  ways to catch up to them you do hear squeaking you hear this and as you look around with the  light 
none	 you can see little bits of movement leaping through this heap  liam rat horde  will rats are going to be wonderful  matt then suddenly thrusting out of some of this heap you see a large arm or tendril brownishtan  in color just slams onto the side of it  orion oh shit i go invisible  will youve got to help where the hell did he go  matt at which point you now see emerging from it two of these giant tendrils which at the end are  covered in these long teethlike spines grasping 
none	 the sides of this stone cylinder pulling itself  out of the refuse shaking as it pulls itself forward you now see the body that contains it  with one third central tendril that rises up what looks like creepy eyes or noseholes that are  looking around and glancing at both of you and you see emerging beneath that the body this  large eight to tenfootthick wide coveredinslime body that is this gargantuan  toothy maw that opens up with a tongue that lolls out and thats where were going to go ahead and  end todays session 
none	 well pick it up next week right where we left off you guys slowly making  your way down the tunnel well pick up with that next time  will toothy maw is where we end it  matt yep toothy maw  marisha tentacley brown twitchy eyeball toothy maw thats all we know  matt thats all you know and some sort of strange sound and other small things moving  wil do you give out prizes for the most ones rolled in a night  because im pretty sure i won that  matt i do and for
