yeah  /town/ matt weve got some other fun surprises for folks that are coming too anyway much love i think  its time  liam oh so tense  matt that we dive into tonights episode of critical role  click tv static  groovy critical role theme  matt welcome back everyone last we left off the mighty nein who had acquired two new allies  in keg the dwarven fighter and nila the firbolg druid had made their way to the city of  shadycreek run after making your way through the town spending an evening staying at the  /none/ landlocked lady and getting some information about where to find info about your quarry and  where your friends may have been taken to after they were captured by the iron shepherds a  traveling slavers crew  sam theyre the worst  matt they are the worst you went and had a discussion at the estate sybaritic with ophelia  mardun of whom you were sent by the gentleman to interface with and do a deed for her a little over  two weeks ago there it seemed that the intent of your job placed here in this city /none/ has aligned with  your current goal of freeing your friends and seeking vengeance against the iron shepherds as  they currently work for a competitive family to the mardun house and in response to them  destroying parts of the trade route that the mardun family enjoys through the center and  southern sides of the empire they wish you to instill damage upon their traders as well by  eliminating the iron shepherds you were given some ideas as to where you might find some help  you gathered your things made your way north into the seemingly /none/ corrupted and haunted savalierwood  to seek information about these iron shepherds and where they are you narrowly avoided two large  immensely mutated bonespurred bear creatures you sought out and cased the exterior of the sour  nest which is the fortress that was given to the iron shepherds by the family that pays them and  keeps them in their employ you decided to send your new druid friend nila in the form of a  small mouse over the wall delivery via owl she snuck through some portions of the fortress to  gather intel and to /none/ get an idea of where you were going and what may reside within a few close  calls and some discovery of what can be expected within the interior you made your way back  safely to join your friends  ashly i forgot about the baby sigh  sam oh yeah  ashly sorry the meal that lorenzo was having  marisha oh yeah  ashly sorry that just occurred to me  matt upon accidentally spooking one of the outer guards who were walking the perimeter of the wall  that surrounds the sour nest you immediately picked /none/ up what you had fled south back through  the savalierwood on your way to shadycreek run to look for means of possibly finding more help for  this endeavor when nightfall hits and whatever else you can do to prepare for the necessary  evacuation of your allies and thats where we left off mighty nein as youve charged back  through the purplishgray corrupted savalierwood the midday sun barely visible through slight  peaking cracks through the canopy above you leaping and hearing these large growling sounds  and hoots you beeline it as best you can and /town/ as quickly as you can before you breach into the  outskirts of the northern side of the north clover area youre now between some of the nearby  buildings and you immediately begin to see some of the relatively shady denizens of this north  side of shadycreek run that glance over their shoulder their hooded selves watching you as you  pass you slow your gait as you are no longer fleeing per se but you have made your way back  to the town what would you like to do  sam what time is it  /none/ matt at this point it would be midday a little bit in the afternoon  sam okay oh god its midday what do we do  ashly were trying to gather allies right  marisha yeah  ashly thats the plan  liam yeah and we dont have all the time in the world because we are trying to intervene before  the worst happens  marisha we mentioned about going and looking to see if a tasker would be up to it there were the  taskers and there were the other group of hired workers  matt yes /town/ the grunge gang the grudge gang which the taskers are a part of it  sam wait is is grudge or grunge  matt grudge  sam can i just say grunge is better name  marisha is it like the grudge gang is an umbrella corporation of the taskers or vice versa  matt vice versa the grudge gang is the overarching loose network of mercenaries that  sell swords and do not affiliate directly with any of the other political powers theyre all just  outside of the system within the town the taskers are a small subsect /none/ of the grudge gang that have  taken it upon themselves to keep the peace to a certain extent  liam do we get a sense of the taskers are they just a group like us like a small group or we  dont know yet  matt well you dont know youve had some experience here the taskers best that you can  surmise you havent had a lot of dealings with them they are probably in the neighborhood of 30  to 35 people they are not a massive group by any means and theyre stretched a little /none/ thin but  because a lot of them have friends within the grudge gang and people theyve worked with  before they can usually call upon friends if need be especially if they have some coin to their  side and they have a specific endeavor they need to do  ashly well  sam do you think we should go talk one chat one up  ashly it seems like the best option to me im not sure who else we could turn to  marisha i mean just to play devils advocate here is it an issue if /town/ we get a hired mercenary  group to kill another underground faction in their same town is that  ashly could it trace back to ophelia is that what you are saying  marisha yeah i dont know its a weird political issue hiring someone in the system  sam maybe before we go randomly hiring people what do we need to make this attack we can  probably get in also were not attacking right were just going to go and try to rescue or maybe  pick off one or two of them or smoke them out so /none/ that the prisoners or whatever have to leave and  we can rescue right were not trying to kill everyone in the motherfucking house right  marisha well this ophelia wants us to kill everyone in the motherfucking house  sam well i just want to get our people out  liam then we are not fulfilling our responsibilities  sumalee it will be impossible to save our friends without killing them  marisha i think shes right  liam we go at night and the first step is taking care of the two there could be more but two /tavern/ that  we saw on the wall whoever is on the wall at night silently then from all youve told us we  have this might be incomplete information but three there is the shithead himself and then two you saw  sumalee at least two eating  liam so three total that we know about  sumalee but there were many more beds  marisha plus who knows who could arrive in the time that were gone  liam that is also correct  marisha i think we need to be prepared for all of them  sam but /none/ are we going to hire muscle or magic or what are we trying to get what helps us  marisha i miss jesters healing spells  sam maybe theres a place to buy some potions  ashly well it seems like i mean im not the stealthiest person it seems like having more  numbers is a good thing i dont know if we could create a distraction of some kind lead some of  them away i dont know  sumalee i can do that im good at that  ashly diversions  sumalee yes  ashly youre very /town/ excited about this nila  sumalee i want to get in there as fast as we can  marisha i mean look the solution might end up solving itself who know who in this town is even  willing to go up against the iron shepherds  ashly wait would i know  sam wait  liam ashly marisha and matt wait  ashly the place where they keep the prisoners is underground  matt correct  ashly could we just burn down the building burn down the motherfucking house  matt its mostly stone  ashly burn down the /none/ is there wood in there  matt theres elements of wood from a decoration standpoint but for the most part its a stone structure  sam we could bring in a lot of kindling  marisha smoke them out thats actually not a bad idea now that i think about it though  liam when you were in this house as a mouse there was no way down there it was a solid trap  door you dont know what was under it  sumalee i could hear them but thats the only thing that i could see  liam /none/ what did you hear specifically  sumalee i heard voices i remember that i was trying to listen for my partner and my son i know  they were the voices of the captured people the prisoners i believe i heard voices as well of  some of the murderers  liam well we need to peel this like an onion we need to i believe get some help get some  reassurance outer layer of the onion is making sure we take whoever is on the walls whoever is  keeping watch out silently so that we can begin /none/ anew with the building itself i think that either  you or my friend here should go in ahead of us so we have some idea of what is happening once in a  while i turn this one into a spider it is slow but it is very undetectable  marisha laughing  liam do you feel differently  marisha sorry im just imagining an infiltration with the spider like thats feasible  sam tip of the spear  marisha go frumpkin go  ashly get him now bite him  matt lorenzo felled by a brown recluse  /none/ marisha put him in his boot  liam truthfully there are ways that i can hurt people with a spider but im just talking about  having a look around so that we are not walking into something different than what you saw last night  marisha sure literally anything is better than a spider though for that i just want to point that out  liam well i disagree with you  marisha i mean theyve got a lot of eyes i get that but i think in terms of a movement  situation spiders arent the best  /none/ liam agree to disagree  ashly do you guys need a second should we take a smoke break  liam you are new this is very typical its just part of the group dynamic we are all friends  sam its like have you ever seen a debate team they pick one side and the other and then they  just go at it for a while  ashly theres no really debating in shadycreek run mostly insult kill insult kill  sam they should really start a debate club  ashly we should really start the first one  /none/ liam i am a master debater  ashly shadycreek debaters side mission  marisha shady debaters  ashly shady debaters thats all i care about now  matt well thats our next merch piece there  marisha laura make a shady debaters debate team shirt  matt nope  liam but we want to take numbers down so we peel the outer layer separately if all goes well then  there is whoever is upstairs the big x factor is what is what is beneath we dont know how many  people are underneath  sam you said the sleeping /none/ quarters are upstairs if we went in the dead of night and i know you  have a spell that can lock a door or shut a door or something  liam if i can find materials in shadycreek i need gold dust a lot of gold dust how likely is  that here  ashly would i know where to find that would that be the general store would that have that  matt they may have it there yeah you havent had to acquire gold dust before but if you were  to ask around you could see /none/ if theres some place in the vicinity that might carry it  liam to first get gold dust i would need gold  ashly which we would also need to hire people  sam we have some  liam how much do we have i have next to nothing  ashly i have 130  sumalee i have ten gold pieces  sam did you say ten  sumalee ten  sam oh wow  sumalee i am happy to contribute that  ashly is it 130 gold or is it silver that i have  matt 130 gold  /none/ liam what about in the haversack does jester have any funds in there  sam oh thats a good question ill reach in and see what she has  marisha ive got a little bit of funds  liam text thread explodes in five four three  sam i need my thing wheres the currency in here  marisha if you go under equipment  ashly you dont remember your handy acronym  sam i need it written down oh there it is  liam remember liam eats farts  sam liam eats farts thats right its right here i /none/ have a few hundred gold  marisha same  ashly maybe we need people on the outside to take care of folks on watch the onion youre talking  about maybe the outer layers are the hired hands and then were the ones who go in  liam yeah it could be a group effort i feel very confident for many of our skills for the ones  on the outside what im concerned about is entering the front door what is behind what i  would like to do is go when they are sleeping and hopefully murder them /none/ in their sleep is the best case  sumalee why dont we call them out then why dont we make them come outside we have more  abilities outside  sam but then theyll have weapons  liam yeah the thing when someone is sleeping in a bed is they are like little whispering i was  going to say babies i shouldnt say that  sam dont say that to her especially  sumalee i cannot use my lightning inside that is all im saying  ashly what if we lure one of them out for you to fry /none/ like a chicken  sumalee i would be okay with that  liam theres a little bit that we have to play this by ear i think we should go at night to  handle things when it is the least busy  ashly is there anything were missing  sam we have no way of healing ourselves if we die unless you have healing potions on you  liam well maybe we can find some in shadycreek  ashly i have two potions of greater healing  sam how many do we all have she has two  marisha /none/ i have one  liam one  sumalee of what  marisha healing potions  sumalee i have healing words  sam ashly and marisha ooh  sumalee does that help  marisha that does help  sumalee excellent and i have those goodberries  marisha those are good those are great  sumalee and i can help give us extra power in my clan we have a bear spirit known as oaktar if i  invoke the spirit of oaktar it gives us each extra power  ashly your clan sounds awesome  sam do i have to go /none/ to church or anything  sumalee no you just have to be i think its within 30 feet of where i put the spirit totem  liam that seems strangely specific  marisha im into it yeah  ashly so to notts point what do we need we need fighters we need magic what do we need  marisha i like the idea of getting some sort of fighter especially if nila can maybe take out  that outer onion layer with the lightning we should have found a better analogy  liam than an onion well how about were /none/ just going to kill the people on the wall how is that  for a metaphor  marisha i like that  liam i like the idea of someone with a little bit of muscle and then another person who is adept at  healing injuries  sam well we did hear about that weird someone said that theres some priest or something or cleric  liam in the woods  marisha ophelia mentioned that yeah  sam yeah so we could go see if they could give us  marisha aid  sam or come along  liam did /none/ ophelia mention how far out into the woods that person was  matt travel on foot is about roughly four to six hours depending on how well you can make your way  through the terrain  liam it is the same day  matt its like two in the afternoon yeah  sam so we can make it tonight  marisha i oddly trust that more than hiring someone from the grudge gang  liam ja that is a good point  marisha i feel like the grudge gang might have ties to the iron shepherds or at least /none/ an inside man  liam yeah friendsies  ashly i mean we could try but if all they are is a healer  sam that would be amazing though i mean healing potions are nice but we need someone who can we  get killed a lot or nearly you know  ashly yeah  marisha ive seen some pretty badass priests in my day  ashly do i have any sense of  sam you have  ashly she mentioned some of the kooky ones out in the woods right  matt yeah she mentioned a blooming grove  /town/ ashly do i have any sense of what that is  matt youve not necessarily heard of the blooming grove roll a history check actually  ashly this not going to go well 12  matt thats not too bad youve vaguely heard of the blooming grove but its not referred to that  very often its more referred to do as the bone orchard  ashly hmm less fun  matt yeah you havent been there but from what you know its this strange ancient gravesite  thats been on the outskirts of town a few miles out since /town/ before the town was built  ashly are these healers considered by people in shadycreek run to be wackadoos or are they  matt from what you know from what youve heard everyone thinks theyre strange creepy hermits  and possibly witches no one really goes there some folk in here tend to put on the air of not  being superstitious but the savalierwood carries a lot of superstition with it some folks while  they may play it off still seem to get a little nervous about delving too deep into it  ashly well that is a /none/ good point if this person lives in the savalierwoods then theyre not weak  theres a lot of crazy shit in the woods so they must be able to hold their own or at least remain discrete  sam they dont belong to any pact or group that we would need to negotiate with  ashly no they live outside the i mean theyre not even really related to the clans  marisha did we hear what god they worship  matt you have no idea  marisha i feel like if it was one of the accepted gods of /none/ the empire you wouldnt have to hide out  in the woods im kind of into this idea  ashly we can try  sam is it worth asking a tasker first what would we even ask just how much it would be to hire you  for some muscle  ashly yeah theyre not affiliated directly its better for them to not be affiliated with any  particular groups so but you know this is not a great place  liam well were weighing two things against each other one is expediency because there are many  people in /none/ shadycreek who could possibly lend a sword or ability but i think that you are  correct that there is no telling their allegiance and im not ruling them out but this  person out in the woods probably not in the pocket of our enemies we need to come to a  decision promptly  ashly well how hardy would you say the mental state of your companions is  marisha the ones in captivity  ashly yeah  sam oh i thought you meant us because were right here we can hear you  ashly no i know /none/ that  marisha probably pretty unstable  ashly what do you think that they would be susceptible to torture  marisha being controlled  sam fjord probably not yashas probably is okay jester has already turned shes flipped  shes probably flipped  ashly oh then theres no rush  liam or wrapped them around her finger one way or the other no they are actually pretty  theyve got their shit together  marisha they arguably have their shit together way more than the three of us do  ashly would they look after  liam a child  /none/ ashly yeah  liam yes  ashly okay  marisha yeah especially jester  ashly then maybe its all right to take a little bit more time  liam we have to make a decision  marisha what time is it  matt pushing past two to three in the afternoon  marisha you said its four hours there  matt four to six hours depending on how well you travel  ashly we have our horses  sam are we walking or horsing  matt thats walking your horse isnt going to go any faster than you in the /none/ middle of this very  clustered forest theres no path that leads to it  marisha brisk power walk there thatll get us there right around sunset talk to people power  walk back should get us there back  sam for the tonight show  marisha yes in time for saturday night live  laughter  ashly lorenzo loves that show hell be up watching it  marisha great  ashly well change the plan  liam announcer voice ophelia mardun  laughter  marisha we might be able to go and get back in time is what im /none/ saying and still be able to  attack tonight  liam to the household ja if we find what we find in the woods is helpful enough and we feel  good with what we got then in the middle of the night is a go  marisha if it is a total bust then that sucks  sam we can still find a tasker  ashly yeah they dont have a bedtime  marisha thats true  liam we want to hit it at two or three in the morning  marisha all right lets go are you good /none/ with that nila you seem apprehensive  sumalee i could check my smell bag but i trust you right now  sam no check your smell bag  sumalee oh thank you it makes me feel so much better  sam see if it passes the smell test  liam whatever makes you feel comfortable  sumalee this is for going to find the priest who has special abilities for reviving the dead and  healing people  sam fart noise  sumalee pretty good okay this is for the taskers and the grunge gang  ashly she took your /none/ name for it  sam oh its a better name  sumalee did i mistake it  ashly and sam no no  ashly thats perfect smell your bag  sumalee it smells salty salty versus a little bit of a raw but grounded spicy flavor i like  that one let us go see the priest thank you smell bag  liam you cannot argue with that  sam no you cannot argue with someone who talks to a smell bag  ashly that is accurate  sumalee it has given me so much comfort over many years i /none/ love it thank you  sam sure  marisha well shall we  liam yeah  ashly and marisha lets power walk  matt all right  sam buttcheeks clenched  ashly whats the one where you wiggle is that power walking  sam speed walking  marisha you know like grandmas in malls like around christmas time  liam are we prancercising  matt everyone has their fitbits attuned  marisha yes  matt first off whats your marching order please  liam oh also are our horses dead  sam no we can take the horses it wouldnt /none/ speed us up but at least wed be on horses  matt you can take them with you  liam but it wouldnt speed us up because its the woods  matt because its like a thick wood  liam lets walk  matt okay whos up front whos in the back whos guiding what  ashly would i know better potentially where im going should i be in front or have i never been to this  matt it depends whoever wants to guide this will be taking the survival checks to lead you through  so who wants /none/ to be making  sam nila you seem to know about the woods no  sumalee i would be happy to oh yes survival is good for me  liam i will walk just behind nila  mat okay so nilas helming that  sumalee you are relying on me im very happy  ashly aww  liam shes just the biggest im going to stand next to the biggest person  matt thats a good call  marisha thats still reliance  matt whos behind or near caleb  ashly ill take up the back  matt all right /none/ so kegs holding up the back beau in the middle  marisha nott do you want the middle  sam yes please  matt there you go ill put frumpkin there next to okay  marisha fuhwumpkin  matt taking this moment now you begin to head back away from shadycreek and helming this group  of ragtag adventures youve under your wing you tread into an area of the savalierwood youve not  traveled before hoping that your instincts your smell bag and the spirit of what nature has  managed to maintain itself through this corrupted wood could /none/ guide you properly to your destination  i need you to make a survival check please  ashly she is superstitiously leading us around just smelling  liam get it girl  sumalee oh  marisha that was almost great  liam is there anything to add to ooh  sumalee ten  matt ten okay you still have your luck feat if you want to unless you want to save it  sumalee oh yes  matt you have two more points left  sumalee i think we should use it yes i would like to use one luck /none/ point  matt one more luck point  sumalee 17 plus seven 24  matt 24 okay  sumalee we shall survive  matt not only do you swiftly manage to find the portions of the wooded paths that are least  blockaded by thorny brambles and fallen halfrotted trees but you also manage to help the  party avoid a few small openings that look uniquely and uncomfortably welcoming in the midst  of a wood like this you know from your experience as well that it is not always a good idea to step  where it seems /none/ most inviting when you know the wood around you to be less so  marisha whispering yes yes  matt as you crest around the second of these open groves you notice how the ground itself seems to  shift slightly and you watch as for a moment it seems to almost pit as elements of the dirt suck  inward you know the antlion funnels that appear in the sand and begins to come in towards them  the ground almost seems to sink in for a second before righting itself the grove stands flat once  more but /none/ thankfully due to the survival instincts of your firbolg leader you manage to  careen past two of these patches without issue pushing on at a fairly intense speed within three  and a half hours not even the full four  ashly hey  matt you manage to make your way to an area where the color notably changes ahead of you the  somewhat still purplegray color that suffuses most of the natural landscape within the  savalierwood gives way to a patch of green in the distance this is the first sign that calls forth  that /none/ warm sensation you got when you had checked this path within your smell bag as the rest of  you begin to gather up behind nila the closer you get you begin to watch as these winter trees that  comprise most of this northern forest give way to green oaks and swampbased plant life the  temperature as you get to a certain threshold begins to be not quite as biting cold slightly  warmer with each step looking around immediately the first thing that catches your eye is this  large wall of tangled vine and thorns the /none/ same purplishgray color the green is still ahead of  you do you guys want to continue on anything you want to do  ashly you said theres a wall of thorns  matt it looks like a natural wall that curls up about five or so feet  ashly in our way  matt in your way yes  sam how far to the sides does it go as far as the eye can see  matt make a perception check  sam thats sort of cocked ill take it anyway 11 plus nothing  matt a little ways /none/ off it seems to dip a bit maybe about 100 feet or so to the northern side of  it youve been traveling northwest to reach this part of the forest  marisha we cant see over the wall  matt you can see over it a bit as theres only about five or so feet most places as you get a  little bit closer you can see areas where these tangle of vines are pulled apart or have entirely  enclosed and you see longrusted wrought iron bars a fence of some kind a boundary that was  /none/ placed long ago that has since been slowly taken back by nature you then begin to see that area of  the wall that you had noticed nott that had seemed to be bending and the vines have actually  curled over and bent it downward it seems that whatever this little section of the forest is  whatever protective magics that once contained this outer vicinity have begun to give in to the  corruption of the savalierwood  sam should we hop the fence  liam one moment i send frumpkin up to flit about 50 feet ahead /none/ to see if there is anything ahead  or from a birds eye view that we are unable to detect  matt okay make a perception check for frumpkin with advantage because it is still in the owl form  liam that is a 21  matt frumpkin darts up jumping from tree edge to tree edge gliding through there are numerous  layers of similar walls three different layers looks like whereas the outskirts or the perimeter  of this beautiful protected ancient gravesite that once held this corruption at bay has slowly  collapsed inward and a new /none/ boundary is placed then that boundary has fallen as the corruption  pulls in further a new boundary is built that third boundary now seems to be in the process of  giving in just like its previous constructs within this third area you can see not just a  lack of snow or ice or the winter chill but a nearly humid summer warmth something more akin to  the southern tip of the empire or even menagerie coast it is an unexpected and extreme shift in  temperature and weather there is something unnatural or at least magical /none/ that maintains  this little pocket of untouched paradise there you can see small pools bits of bog where the  soft green and browns of compost fall into green thick algaecovered bits of water you can see  dozens and dozens of stone tablets about a foot to two feet high with bits of script across them  too far to see that have partially fallen or leaning at which point frumpkin looks around and  this entire area from the outer very edge where that first perimeter wall was found to the inside  has all been graves /none/ most taken back by the savalierwood as it slowly crushes whatever this  location is at its source on the far end towards the core and the back the northern side of this  final defending pocket of uncorrupted forest you can see a stone building maybe 20 by 30 feet  built as an old stone steeple it stands windowless open and the floor of it to each open  window overgrown with green vine and leaf  liam frumpkin is how far from me at this point  matt frumpkin is about 100 to 150 feet from you /none/  liam so i can only watch i have muttered all this watching we are talking concentric rings  matt yeah  marisha i think this is the place  liam ja  matt frumpkin begins to return and a passing of one of the clouds gives more sunlight that breaks  through what was previously a very dense gray sky as the light passes between the small breaks  in the tree canopies the green comes to light with color numerous types of color a rainbow of  flowers of pigments youve never really seen before begin to emerge /none/ as the light hits it  nearly every inch of these gravesites contain a smattering scatter of rainbow colors across petal  and stamen  liam i am beginning to think this a little more than we came looking for but we have traveled a ways  sam is there any sign of life i mean other than plant life  matt you saw maybe a few frogs small natural creatures that exist within this space but  nothing that would resemble a human yet it seems still  sam and ashly lets go in  sam how do we /none/ get over these things could we climb them or would we get cut to shreds  matt you can certainly try  ashly how tall are the gates  matt the areas where the fence has been pushed in is between five to six feet in places areas where  it seems to be pushed down lower to about four to even three and a half  ashly your friends coat i know its maybe not  sam you mean the tapestry  ashly the tapestry i know it might hurt it but if we drape it over  marisha /none/ we buried him with it  ashly oh thats right  marisha but thats a good idea  ashly you want to go back i could try to hack at it with my axe  sumalee could an animal jump over it  matt yeah you guys could attempt to climb and leap over elements of it are thorned and jagged  marisha this is what i used to do to hop fences back in the day i look for a few brokendown  branches that might be my height  matt make an investigation check  marisha a handful /none/  liam we are going on a witch hunt we cant go over it we cant go under it  marisha ten  matt thats fair it takes you a few minutes and you find a couple of softer pieces of branch and  vine that have fallen to the corruption its interesting you touch them and theyre supple  like vines but theyre gray and freezing to the touch its a very weird unnatural feeling but  it seems supple  marisha before i do anything with it i take it over to nila nila have you seen any /none/ type of  blight on a plant like this before do you know what this is its cold feel it  sumalee youre right do i know what this is  matt make a nature check  sumalee i love making nature checks yes 17  matt youve studied and seen within the vicinity of where you grew up and where your clan had  raised you and your children numerous types of disease and natural means of plant life succumbing  to illness or an outside force what you can tell is that this is not natural this is /none/ not some  naturally formed blight there is some much older and much more powerful latent reasoning for this corruption  sumalee i do not feel safe using it  ashly i know this is wellworn dwarf goof territory but does someone want to throw me  sam that seems very derogatory also youre super heavy though arent you  ashly thats true you all want to throw me  marisha i take the branches and i try to lay them down over the vines a little bit and give a little  less thorny of a ramp  matt /none/ you lean them up against it and slowly they bow over  marisha look they hook all on their own thats pretty good  ashly good job beau  marisha thank you look at that  sam we could try to throw you  ashly i guess it might make more sense to throw you but i dont want to  sam no you can throw me sure  liam caleb starts to climb over  matt all right make a perception check  liam 16  matt as you carefully place your hands across the elements of vine and /none/ root you manage to keep a  keen glance for any sort of bladed thorned or hooked elements that protrude from the local  fauna you manage to avoid any of them from catching your coat catching your flesh and step  leaping over to the opposite side without issue  sam thats amazing hes amazing  liam nobody was aware i was panicked the whole time the thorns are almost like small razors  sam im coming  liam careful  sam im just going to dash over  matt youre just going to dash over make an acrobatics /none/ check  sam that was 12 plus 19  matt caleb has shown areas as he passed over where you can safely climb the rest of you dont  need to make checks nott ignores this entirely and goes leaping and flipping and attempting to  make her way over the actual fence bends slightly at the impact of foot the iron beneath having  wilted due to longform rust and whatever perpetual weight has been placed upon it from this  land attempting to reclaim it from underneath nott leaps double flip in the air lands on the  /none/ opposite side skids a bit as your feet hit a slight bit of the icy floor but you manage to  catch yourself no issue  ashly keg holds up a ten  matt each of you make your way over this element of the forest continuing on past the next two  boundaries eventually making your way into the central area of the blooming grove the term now  striking a bell as you look around and can see these beautiful flowers as the sun rays hit and  pass its like the color flares up once the light /none/ hits it and then seems to gray as it passes on  you now stand temperature much warmer and theres just that stone structure ahead  liam how far away is the structure  matt from where youre standing on the interior of it about 40 or so feet  marisha on the tombstones that are around do i recognize any of the language or can i tell how  old some of these gravesites are  matt make an investigation check  marisha 21  matt looking through there are a few languages that come through most of them /none/ are elven and they  are very old some of them appear to be 100 200 400500 years old whatever individuals or  families or bloodlines have been interred in this space have been placed here for a very long time  until recently  marisha until recently okay  matt you do see one that appears to be maybe about ten years old very faint elements of wear  and tear  marisha whats the name  matt the name on that one would be elvish and it would be tyriel casala  marisha tyriel castala  matt casala /none/  marisha casala  matt she knows elvish but she doesnt really speak it often so the pronunciations get a little weird  liam domo arigato  ashly so should i go knock on that door  sam is there a door  matt there is a door yes  liam hold on  sam how big a place is the door place  matt the door itself is maybe four feet wide its a single door its an old wood the bottom  half of it is green with growing moss and other bits of vegetation that are set /dung/ in to the  relatively damp wood that its constructed from the top seems to be split and warped a little bit  over time due to the moisture in the air  liam caleb tries to creep up to a gravestone and hide behind it to get within 30 feet of the door  matt okay make a stealth check  sam on the roof or the top of the sorry  liam nine  sam on the roof or top of the structure are there any holes or anything  matt make a perception check  sam 13 /none/  matt best you can see no its pretty well made the walls and the roof all appear to be made from stone  sam but no windows or anything  matt there are windows you can only really see the front and right side of it the southeast side  of it from your perspective there is a single window it is an arched window that looks like it  may have been built at one point to hold glass or stained glass but it is no longer there you can  see the soft junglelike flora at the /none/ base of it has swooped up and grown over and into the  interior of the structure best you can tell from this distance there is no visible light  immediately inside but there is a bit of natural light that is coming in through the open space  sam can i go over to the window and take a peek in stealthily  matt sure roll a stealth check  sam 12 ill take a big swig of booze and then go over and try  matt okay you begin to dart across the open space dodging through gravestones /none/ and as youre  passing one of them there is a bit of a thorned vine that catches the back of your cloak it pulls  taut before you get yanked on your neck slip back and nott slams on the ground giving a little sound  ashly keg holds up a ten  sam why do you have that with you  ashly im trying a bit im trying a new thing  matt theres a brief pause all of you hold in silence hearing a distant bird that goes quiet  the wind passing through the trees you /none/ hear the wooden door begins to slowly open as a shaded  figure steps beyond the frame taliesin if you want to step in  cheering  matt finally laughing  taliesin this is my stuff  liam youre really just a random shopkeep in the woods  taliesin its dangerous to go alone  liam and taliesin take this  taliesin just going to get my stuff  matt would you like to describe what they see emerge from this small stone temple  taliesin from this small stone temple emerges a tall not necessarily healthily thin firbolg who /none/  is pale and a grayish color and has a big shock of weirdly pink mohawk hair  liam you dont say  sam no  taliesin im going way off the reservation here hes a little gaunt hes got a little fuzz hes  wearing this bizarre hes wearing this very gentle silk shirt thats got one long flowy  sleeve hes got a cup of tea hes just staring huh i think ive only got three more cups hold  on i go back in  sam shouting do you know her do you know him  sumalee /none/ its a firbolg he is a firbolg  sam shouting do you know him whats his name  sumalee i do not but hes a firbolg he is one of my people gasps he is a firbolg this will  be good my smell bag was right again  taliesin im going to come out im going to have a little kettle set up on a little tripod im  putting it down im putting a big rod with a big purple chunk of amethyst on it underneath the  kettle tapping it a couple times to get the kettle /none/ to start heating up im going to wander  into the graveyard and find some flowers for tea  matt okay  sam can we tag along do you need any help  liam does he seem like hes going to kill us  matt make an insight check  liam thank you 19  matt 19  liam neinteen  matt there doesnt seem to be any threat at the moment  taliesin mr clay and nah im fine one second  sam hes mr clay  taliesin i come back with a pile of redpurple flowers and im /none/ grinding up this is from casala  textile family generations ago but they make very good tea now sighs  marisha wait back up a second are you mr clay  taliesin mm caduceus clay sit  marisha caduceus clay  taliesin im going to put out the three cups and wait for the pot to boil  sam hello  marisha is that caduceus with a k or a c okay  sam hi oh we have to wait  taliesin pour out the three cups you have to share i apologize  ashly i dont drink tea booze /none/ is fine  liam i come over and sit and take one of the teas  marisha caleb and i will share one and i hand the other to nila  sumalee i would love to try your tea  taliesin please let me know what you think  sumalee it is delicious  taliesin only grows here  sumalee i would like to hug you  taliesin oh please come  sumalee nila gives him a big hug  taliesin i havent had one of these in a long time thats nice  sumalee i am from the guiatao /none/ tribe do you know us  taliesin no im sure theyre wonderful though that sounds just great that sounds wonderful  friends sigh you have come sigh please let me know what i can do for you usually when people  come here it is because of some great tragedy how can i alleve your pain  liam oh well herr clay we come to you with a great tragedy  marisha a few great tragedies  liam do you want to or should i  marisha well the first one is i think its time for caleb to have /none/ another bath its been a  little bit  liam thats the first one  marisha being without a shower has been a bit of a tragedy  liam whispering do we really have time for a comedy bit like this  marisha no  sam we recently lost one of our friends  taliesin i would assume  marisha i didnt want to open the gate like that thats why were here  taliesin people who come here usually have  sam we arent here to bury him hes already in the ground weve come to avenge him and /none/ we were  hoping to find some help in these parts  taliesin avenge him what happened  ashly do you know the iron shepherds  taliesin do i know the iron shepherds  matt you actually have not you would have no idea  taliesin no im sorry i really dont get to leave very often especially these days  liam how long have you been alone out here  taliesin contemplative sigh been 20 seasons now 18 seasons try not to count it just gets in  the way of more important things  liam how many seasons /none/ has it been since someone has knocked on your door like we have  taliesin its been about two seasons i suppose little bit of business but its been very slow  marisha do you only gauge time in seasons  taliesin its the only time that seems to matter  marisha thats fair  sumalee i agree  sam do you work here is this your place do you own this land  taliesin im so excited  sam are you the funeral director  taliesin most people who come here know what this place is this is going /none/ to be delightful ive  never had to explain it to someone before  sam its a graveyard its a boneyard  taliesin well boneyard is a bit crass but yeah this is a place where we take the dearly departed  who have done well and the people who have lived good lives and we put them into earth that has  been touched by the wildmother in turn she grants them with beauty and splendor and sometimes tea  sam like a boneyard sort of a place  taliesin more like a garden we have been tending this /none/ garden for generations  marisha were drinking dead people tea  taliesin arent we all  liam that is a very fair point  marisha very true but youre cultivating dead people for good tea  taliesin arent we all  marisha yeah okay yeah thats a good point  liam we are very random visitors from out of the blue we do come to you with tragedy we do have a  friend in the ground we do have friends who are in dire need of assistance you help people into  the ground but offhand do you help /none/ them out of the ground  taliesin well i mean sometimes we can help people who are on the edge of death we certainly  understand that most people would rather spend their time alive than not and that makes sense i  certainly have no interest in shortening my life any time soon  sam but you cant bring someone back whos already expired  taliesin i mean thats very tricky once youre dead theres a natural order to things theres a  movement that things have to go but in certain cases im sure  liam weve all /none/ read stories of the extraordinary but you do not have this in your wheelhouse you  are saying  taliesin oh i can sometimes help people you never know  marisha okay well beyond helping our recently passed friend how do you feel about helping  people who are on the edge of life and death in captivity  liam three in the cage is worth one in the dirt  sumalee there are firbolgs in this group too that need help  sam theyve been kidnapped including a firbolg child  marisha and they might not have long to /none/ live  ashly theyre being held by the iron shepherds  sam who are bad guys were good guys well were sort of bad guys too  marisha were working on it  liam we are not bad guys  ashly were doing all right  sam are you a bad guy  taliesin you know honestly i dont think ive had enough experience to have an opinion on that  im a good gardener  sam what do you grow other than dead tea  taliesin i grow lilies i grow bramble mushrooms moss  marisha dead bramble dead /none/ mushrooms dead moss  liam if you are saying that you are able to help people back from the brink of extinction on  occasion or under the right circumstances i am going to hazard a guess that you could heal a  wound in a snap yeah  taliesin not with an actual snap but yeah i can do that i dont have to snap though i can be  really quiet when i do it pretty quiet i actually have to say something now that i think  about it  ashly im going to take a guess /none/ you dont leave here very much do you  taliesin ive left a few times i suppose its been a while ive been on my own for a while it  makes you get a little rambly  sam youre stationed here are you allowed to leave  taliesin thats a bit of a story my family have run this temple for generations and im sort of  the last one left holding the fort down  sam no cousins or anything  taliesin no cousins a couple sisters a brother my parents but everyones either wandered off to  /dung/ help try and fix whats been going wrong or has been put into the earth  sam whats been going wrong whats that whats going wrong  taliesin well as im sure youve possibly noticed and i apologize if im breaking some  terrible news to anyone who didnt the forest beyond my little patch of earth is a little  unsavory its dark it can be a bit dangerous dont recommend going out alone it has been  overtaking our temple for the last hundred years and recently has breached the walls again  sam so your family is /none/ trying to fix that  taliesin the last one to leave was my sister she went east  liam now its just you  taliesin now its just me its not much to hold down at this point  ashly why do you stay  taliesin honestly because its a little dangerous for a lone person to leave i figured  id sit here with a kettle and wait for someone to come along and maybe see if i can make my way out  of here and figure out whats been happening in this place  liam well youre /none/ double lucky  sam this is great so you dont have to check in every night and be here to punch in and punch  out you could leave whenever you want  taliesin i could leave whenever i want sure  marisha is there a watering system or can you put it on a timer if youre not going to be here  sam a dripline  taliesin thats a really good idea i dont i mean if you guys in a serious rush if you could  help im sure we could figure out  marisha maybe were /none/ in a rush maybe after  liam herr clay we are dealing with a timesensitive situation you are looking for a  segue out of this predicament youre in  taliesin mmm  ashly i feel like its only fair to warn you if you were to come with us wed be asking you to go  into a situation thats not very safe  taliesin are you inviting me to come with you  sumalee yes very much  ashly oh yeah sorry did we not  sam we came here seeking help in a mission that were about /none/ to go on  taliesin thats excellent youre lucky i came along then this is going to work out really well  marisha well we came to you  taliesin well youre lucky that i stayed right here so that you intercepted me because if i had  wandered off ten 15 feet this may have never happened  liam herr clay we should be very honest with you we are intending to do good by people who  deserve it a young one good people but we are going to do very difficult business tonight or tomorrow  taliesin /none/ well i dont know if i think that anyone deserves anything but i dont like cages  and im really  marisha you dont have a particular penchant or sympathy towards people who eat babies do you  taliesin that seems a little specific im mostly interested in trying to take care of the natural  order of the world and nature itself  ashly does murder end up on that checklist  taliesin have you ever been in nature yes violence is extremely natural  ashly tight  sumalee no the people we are after have done terrible things /none/ they have upset the balance of  nature so much by what they have done they do not deserve to live please come with us i have an  idea if you can come with us maybe some of the firbolgs from my tribe can come help you here  afterwards can help keep the temple afterwards  taliesin well i dont know about deserve but i think theres always somewhere theres a plant  that needs some compost and im happy to make some more if itll make people happy  marisha was that you saying youre willing to /none/ kill people and put them in the ground to make compost  sam i think so  taliesin you got a lot of aggression you got a lot of anger  marisha oh man youre seeing me at a relatively calm moment actually  liam welcome to the mighty nein  taliesin theres only  marisha dont overthink it  taliesin okay  sam do you know pumat sol by any chance  ashly nott  sam what  taliesin is that a time of plant  sam all right then no no i just had to ask  taliesin /none/ ive actually already packed ill go get my things  sam what wait what would we owe you for this  liam do you require anything  taliesin i do i may ask for it later  sam money  liam youll have it  sumalee firbolgs do not need money  liam youll have it  sam tea  taliesin i like this one ill go get my green beetle armor  sam what  sumalee excited gasp i have not come across a firbolg with green beetle armor  taliesin thank you my sister made it im very /none/ proud of her  matt its a chitinouslooking metal breastplate that has a somewhat pearlescent turquoise  greenblue tint to it that seems to shift in the light  taliesin i get a big knotted wetlooking stick that is covered in lichen the armor is also  covered in lichen its a big growing living wet thing it has a big purple amethyst rock at the  top of the staff i get a little shield also made out of beetle  liam motherfucking druid  marisha whispering fungal armor  taliesin sighs give me a minute just going to /none/ walk around once take it in  sam if the thing he needs from us is our blood or something shouldnt we know that in advance we  should find out what he wants from us before we just blindly agree to this what if he wants keg  liam whispering well figure that out  sam some sort of like concubine thing i dont know what if hes creepy or freaky like that  ashly im kind of into that  sam really  ashly im not picky  sam wow  marisha your blood you got some to /none/ spare you can get more of it thats how your body works  sam what  sumalee he does not seem freaky to me at all he seems very nice like a normal firbolg  sam warily okay  taliesin all right im ready to leave this is going to be a little much but i think i can do  it im ready  marisha hey clay did you bury tyriel colsala here  taliesin casala  marisha yeah him thats what i said  taliesin what did you think you were drinking  marisha accented casala  taliesin /none/ yeah thats very close its good its always worth trying  marisha were you around when you buried him  taliesin casala family i think we have eight in their generation i was only here for the last two  marisha all right  liam so let me tell you about the murderers we are dealing with  sam while we walk  marisha power walking  ashly yep  matt all right making your trek back to the forest are you helming this as well  liam first there was the dinosaurs  laughter  sumalee may i helm /town/ it with clay  taliesin caduceus caduceus clay you can call me clay  sumalee caduceus  liam marisha and sam deuces  sumalee deuces clay  sam it is decided  taliesin i have been trying not to show you this art for two weeks now  matt caduceus are you wanting to help or nila i think is asking for your help in fording this  forest as you have a little more experience  taliesin sure  matt so make your survival check with advantage  taliesin okay  sam where are we going back to town /none/ or straight to the  ashly oh yeah do we want to go and try to get some taskers on our side we have a healer now  but we still dont have  sumalee 21  matt 14 and a 14  sumalee i got 14 and 14  matt its up to you guys  sumalee i dont think we need them  ashly you dont think we need any more help  marisha we might be all right  sam we dont even know what he does  ashly im with nott  sam hes a firbolg /none/ yeah but hey mr clay im going to shoot beau with my crossbow  taliesin that doesnt seem like a very good idea  sam oh i missed  laughter  matt arrow whizzing away  sam 12  marisha yeah no  sam sorry i was just going to test if he could really heal you  marisha the fuck  sam ill shoot again with my bonus action thats a natural 20  laughter  matt go ahead and roll damage  taliesin you make me figure out how to do this  sumalee dont worry i can /none/ cure them too  sam not a sneak attack because she was looking oh boy thats ten but its a crit does that do anything  matt well you double the dice that you rolled  sam okay so thats 12 plus four is 16  matt you take 16 points of piercing damage beau  marisha im going to try to catch it  matt okay go for it  marisha okay i roll a d10  matt roll a d10  marisha a ten plus my monk level right which is five  matt i think so is /none/ that what it says right there  liam so only one hit point  sam just the tip  marisha 1d10 plus eight oh its my monk level plus my proficiency bonus so no damage  matt it goes for right underneath where the clavicle and the neck meet and catches it right there  sam oh but with this crossbow when i roll a natural 20 it shoots another one immediately  matt thats right  sam do i have to roll for that one  matt you have to roll to attack  sam thats a 23 to /none/ hit  matt go ahead and roll damage on that one  sam eight  matt what happens is you pull back to fire and as it gets ready to go ahead and extend it looks  like another bolt slips up into it accidentally and it fires two in a row beau catches one and is  like ugh ow and theres a second one thats jammed right into the space between two ribs  ashly what the hell nott  sam first of all that was cool and this was cool  marisha and third of all that /dung/ was a killing blow  sam now do your thing  marisha you could fucking kill me  taliesin is she always like this this seems kind of extreme  sumalee this is the most extreme ive ever seen her  sam do your thing  marisha im keeping this bolt this is mine now  sam okay  marisha i rip the other one out yeah i put that and im keeping this one too  ashly keg is aroused  taliesin come here all right and i get in there and im going to do cure wounds and /none/ theres going  to be a little bit of lichen that grows on the wound really quickly  marisha dont infect me  taliesin its fine do i roll for that  matt yeah its a d8 plus your wisdom modifier the wound seems to close as you watch this  taliesin six points of damage six points of healing  matt you go up by six you watch as this bright redpink colored lichen mossy material seems to  come out of the wound and close it and then turn gray break away and crumble off where it is /none/  the wound seems to have closed and healed over like weeks of healing have gone by  marisha okay this shits dope  sam youre welcome  ashly probably a different way we could have demonstrated that nott  taliesin it felt very  marisha that wasnt for you never mind  sumalee they can be strange but they are good  taliesin honestly its been so long since ive been around anybody i genuinely wouldnt have  been able to tell  matt in making your journey back toward shadycreek run the sun does set part way through /dung/  your journey the forest goes dark nearly pitch black now i believe all of you but caleb have  some sort of darkvision at this point the crickets start coming out very loudly the distant  sound of skittering and animal movements through brush and dry leaves catch the outside of your  peripheral you manage to stop every now and then as nila puts her hand up listening and smelling  for anything nearby are you guys continuing at a fast pace or are you attempting to be stealthy  ashly well did we decide what were doing /none/  marisha i think we were going to go straight there  ashly were going straight to the shepherds  marisha its on the way  liam we didnt really discuss we got distracted  matt thats true are you guys heading back to shadycreek or are you heading straight to the  sour nest  sam is it on the way  marisha its on the way i say we at least stop by and scout it  sam if its more or less on the way then yeah we can at least swing by  matt itll add /town/ an hour or so to go into shadycreek essentially this is shadycreek run at  the bottom of the forest and youve traveled from your perspective far northwest to get to the area  where you met caduceus youre now heading back down and the sour nest is on the northeastern side  of the city just outside of it so you have to scoot and ricochet off  sam so wed have to go through the town just to get there  matt no you could go straight to it through the forest but it depends on what you /dung/ want to do if  youre going straight there or if youre wanting to skim through shadycreek its your choice  marisha how long after dusk has it been  matt the sun set with that roll you made youll be arriving at shadycreek run at about 1000pm  liam we are going to find somebody spur of the moment tell them to come with us out to the  woods to do a bit of dark business  marisha are you being facetious i cant tell  liam no i dont know if thats a good idea i dont /town/ like our options at the moment any of them  really i feel like we dont have we are one more person than when we got our asses handed to  us on the road and we thought we had the upper hand then now we have one more that is better  but if we go to the town and we find a couple of neerdowells wholl work for coin we are  convincing them to come with us right away into the woods into the woods  sam into the woods and out of the woods  taliesin /none/ that would be the hope i imagine youd leave the woods once you went into the woods i  mean you dont just want to sit there i mean thats what i do but im not sure that was really  a great decision so yeah huh  sam are you talking to us  taliesin im just thinking out loud ive had a few years to just think out loud  sam how old are you  marisha how many seasons old are you  taliesin been about 100 give or take  sam but theres four seasons or /none/ is it three seasons up here i dont know  marisha 25  sam hes between 25 and 100  taliesin thatll do  liam what do you think  marisha im still afraid if we roll into shadycreek once again just pointing out what we  are two firbolgs a goblin and then some kind of acceptablelooking people and someone with a  reputation well by societys standards  ashly a lot of shade just got thrown  marisha look come on  liam if we do that the three of us would do the talking naturally  marisha /town/ im just saying we will draw attention to ourselves and then we might go around asking  people to kill the iron shepherds and that might draw more attention to ourselves in a town that it  feels the iron shepherds kind of run or at least have a better foothold in it than we do  ashly how would this be different thats my question one more person sure a healer sure but  liam well we could take them at night which we did not do before some of them would be awake  probably not all of /none/ them we had the element of surprise before we hopefully have it now  ashly theyre on home turf  liam home turf is big  sam can i just say again i dont give a shit about ophelias request or the gentlemans offer  i just want to get all of our friends and get out if we can kill them great but if our aim is not  to kill them it makes this a much easier mission  marisha do you know ophelia clay  taliesin no  marisha sorry you just had a face like you /none/ recognized  taliesin i had to think a little bit about it but no  liam you know nott i agree with you the most important thing is getting the people who are in  that basement the most important thing youve always got to improvise  sam yes  ashly so youre saying go in with the plan of killing them and then switch it up if need be  liam the only thing that i believe is known is taking care of the people on that wall anyone  outside i will send frumpkin around to see if /none/ there are more than just these two then we will  have decisions to make we will need to send in frumpkin again or our new friend here one of us  one of them and make a plan from there that is all we know now we need to do something and i  feel a little on edge with our numbers but i am maybe more on edge by the ticking clock  marisha okay  sam lets swing by the baddies house and just see whats going on  marisha anyone in particular feel super strongly about /none/ going and getting more help should we put  it to a vote  sumalee do you carry a smell bag  taliesin a what  ashly so much disappointment  sam she sniffs a purse every time she wants to make a decision  ashly its worked out so far  sumalee its filled with things from nature that i find significant  taliesin that seems like a really good idea actually i should start doing that  sumalee it helps me so much  taliesin what a good way to make a decision  marisha what does your /none/ smell bag say do we go and we get more people or do we go to the house  sumalee i do not need to check it no smell check necessary  marisha make a smell check  sumalee i just want to go it will be okay we have two firbolgs  marisha i mean shes so convincing  ashly nila i love your enthusiasm but again theyre on home turf they have more people than i  thought more abilities than i thought i mean we hire a couple of taskers i know its not ideal but if /town/  marisha all right new plan we split the party  sam no terrible idea  marisha half go to the house the other half go look for more help and then we meet you  sam hows the half at the house going to do  marisha watch  sam no  marisha all right  sam lets swing by the house and check it out if theres a raging party well just continue on to  town if it seems dead maybe well do a little recon if the recon goes well maybe well do a  little /none/ insertion  ashly are you describing a date right now  sam the insertion goes well maybe we go steady  taliesin i dont know what any of that means  sumalee you will get used to it i just laugh along now  taliesin all right  ashly look theyre your people so ill leave it to you guys but i dont love the odds  sumalee i know because of your abilities if we can draw more of them outside we will stand a  better chance we will have more power than you had last time  /none/ marisha lets go to the house  sam were just going to watch  marisha yeah  sam were going to see what its like at night so if we have to come back tomorrow night well know  what to expect are there more guards at night we dont know they could have six more dudes who  come up there at night  marisha lets go were wasting time just talking  sam well just look  marisha well go look  matt okay so you head straight to the sour nest all right over the next couple /none/ of hours you make  your way scooting as opposed to the more southern direction you were traveling heading eastward  carefully making your way on the outskirts of the northern side of north clover of shadycreek run i  need you all to make stealth checks  marisha shit  matt disadvantage for you keg unfortunately  ashly fuck  taliesin tonight can i just politely ask the forest to just give us a round this time just in  case i want to talk to a couple of trees see if theyd be all right just giving us /none/ a little passage  matt okay roll a wisdom check  taliesin all right wisdom save or wisdom check  matt wisdom check  taliesin all right 21  matt you bend in quietly placing your hand against one of the nearby trees the bark being  cold and somewhat soft from the moisture of the snow that had melted from the day before you feel  the oppressive sense of the central nature that encompasses the savalierwood give way ever so faintly  ashly wait maybe a stupid idea you guys can talk to plants plants are neutral what /none/ if we  lead them into the woods  sam what  sumalee now youre thinking like i was i didnt have that specific idea  ashly the iron shepherds we could lure them into the woods  sam and then what  ashly we fight them in there  sumalee we can have the plants entangle them  ashly i dont know it could be a backup if this plan goes south if they wake up or something but  if they can talk to the plants the woods are anyones game theyd be fighting other creatures  not /none/ just us  liam but what is it that lures the shepherds out of their hole  sam they wont leave  marisha ive got fireworks  sumalee i can put a stink bomb inside really stinky not like what you call my stink pouch  liam that will put them in the courtyard it will not probably put them in the woods  sam wed need to take one of theirs take lorenzo or something theyd have to come after us there  would be no reason for them to leave  ashly do i know if lorenzo is /none/ a loyal person like would he give or would he just let someone  die if they got taken  matt best that you can tell hes not a leave no man behind type individual  ashly okay  marisha he isnt  matt he is not  ashly but he is a vengeful type of individual  matt hes definitely a fan of an eye for an eye  ashly if it goes south and we manage to kill one of them he might chase us  liam true  sam or maybe not  ashly or maybe not /none/ it could be a backup  sam no its good  liam and marisha lets go  ashly oh stealth checks right  matt stealth checks  taliesin first stealth check wheres my stealth seven  sam 26  ashly seven  liam ten  marisha 12  sumalee 20  matt okay  ashly these are such bad stealth checks  matt thanks to you speaking with nature i am ignoring one of the lowest stealth rolls  ashly only one  matt even still you approach the outskirts of the sour nest the clouds of the night are /town/ broken  here and there the very darkened night occasionally broken by the errant moonbeam that  manages to sweep through the open grove where this fortress was built the canopy itself cleared out  leaving it open for the occasional peek of white through the clouds the same perimeter wall you  see being slowly trained across by two guards dressed in the same hooded attire as those that  you previously saw as you saw as well bringing the three carts northward from the glory run road  as you begin to approach keg unfortunately manages to step /none/ on a hornets nest it crunches  under your foot and for a brief second you inhale very sharply knowing this familiar sound  this is not the first hornets nest youve stepped into thankfully a moment passes no hornets it  was abandoned and had fallen from a tree however you do hear a voice on the wall say hello  ashly shit  sam how far  matt about 70 feet from you  liam i think we might be doing this now so be prepared for it  ashly i dont want to put frumpkin in danger /none/ but could we pretend it was frumpkin if he shoots out  or something  liam frumpkin shoots up into the air and bounces off a tree  matt hoots oh there you are again you sucker hes going to raise a crossbow again  ashly oh no oh my god if i kill someone again  laughter  matt that is a 13 to hit what is frumpkins armor class as an owl  liam i have an owl here it is that hits  ashly oh  sam burchicide  ashly shit  matt that is four points /none/ of piercing damage to frumpkin  liam frumpkin is alive  sam what  matt how many hit points does the owl have  liam well its 1d4 plus one and i rolled it last time and i rolled a four so its 1d4 plus one  matt so its five this owl takes a crossbow bolt to the chest and is like flapping you hear the  same voice go fucking hell what phil i fucking shot an owl its still flying i hate  this forest its bullshit you hear this voice a little further away go laughing /none/ you suck  hes like shut up loads another bolt into it and starts you see now is actively looking for  the owl to finish it off and regain his pride  liam i told him to go down low to the ground yeah  marisha can you bring him back i kind of want that arrow  liam ja i can but i poof into frumpkins senses do i hear anything besides phil and  mystery man  matt make a perception check with advantage  liam ja because of the hearing  matt yeah  liam oh /none/ thats good on the first roll the first roll is good so it is 18  matt 18 okay hearing the two men banter back and forth a little bit the errant prodding that  phil seems to be giving to this individual beyond that theres the crickets in the air theres  other nocturnal birds that are starting to rouse from their slumber to go hunting for the night  from the direction of the sour nest frumpkin glances up and can see on the second floor there  are two openings you had seen previously on the second /none/ floor of this fortress on each side and  there appears to be a very faint bit of firelight and a shadow that passes by one the other so  there is somebody moving on the second floor of this  liam whos in the building  matt of the inside of it yes  liam okay i snap my fingers and frumpkin vanishes leaving the bolt where he was and then  i do it again hes here  matt all right very wounded but alive  liam may i borrow one of your goodberries  sumalee absolutely  /none/ liam is this one okay  sumalee you may take i believe there are four or five left  liam i will take four  sumalee please  liam one two three four you may keep that one thank you  matt frumpkin happily eats from the goodberries  ashly and hes better  matt yeah the wounds close slowly the magic of the goodberries healing the crossbow bolt over eventually  ashly oh god sorry guys  sam we can maybe use this we could make a distraction owl that he will focus on and we  could take /none/ him out from afar  marisha do you have an illusion that you can do that its a good idea maybe we shouldve done  that to begin with  liam we could potentially keep moving now if we want to because  ashly we got the lay of the land  liam yeah we know theres two on the wall maybe thats their mo every night theres two on the  walls people are awake inside what is the hour right now  matt id say at this point its close to 1030  liam 1033 yeah  taliesin /town/ thats very specific  liam yeah it is  taliesin are you just going for that or is that going to mean something  liam oh im sorry 1034 now  taliesin in a minute its going to be 1035  liam yeah approximately  taliesin how about now  liam its still 1034  taliesin but its closer to 1035  liam im not going to do this right now we have a decision to make doesnt seem any better or  worse from the outside but we are outside the onion are we going back to town to /none/ get a little  more muscle or are we making a go of it here  marisha all right who votes for more muscle lets put it to a vote  liam well how successfully could we silently kill these two on the wall you would be good at one  sam silently we can kill these two i think very easily as long as you dont move  ashly i wont im staying right here  liam but pitch it to me how you i know  sam can take this guy easily if do you fight people from /none/ afar  taliesin not quietly  sam how about you nila do you have anything that can shoot from afar  sumalee lightning i told you  sam well something thats not like hey look were here weve got lightning something  sumalee poison spray  sam okay i mean thats  sumalee ten feet no thats not from very far  sam we have beau shes quiet i could distract one while you go up and just crack  marisha how tall is the wall how would i be able to get on the wall  matt the wall /none/ is about 12 to 15 feet its not terribly tall its about five feet wide  marisha are we walking the perimeter if were doing a perimeter walk i want to look and see if  there are any branches and trees that might be growing close to the wall that i could  matt you do know from previously looking over it that theyve cleared out the forest about ten  feet from the outer wall specifically to prevent anyone from climbing over into the space  sam i can shoot one with a crossbow  sumalee i have /none/ a sling too  sam okay  liam yeah but we have to finish the job instantly  marisha yeah weve got to do both at the same time ideally theres got to be a team one and a  team two on the guy ive got my throwing darts but theyre not super great  ashly your lightning it doesnt make a storm around it right its just a lightning bolt we couldnt  sam controlled lightning  ashly make it seem like its a storm rather than an attack  sam well listen you can distract him with /dung/ the actual frumpkin while i shoot it doesnt have to  be an illusory frumpkin i can still shoot  liam could also shoot him from the dark when hes not expecting it to happen  sam thats true  marisha also sometimes maybe its just a stormy night here in the forest  taliesin this phil must be a really bad person if youre  ashly yeah hes a real dick  sam phils the worst  ashly are they within eyesight of each other im assuming so  matt they are yes  sam i can if you /none/ guys i can shoot i got a shooty thing i can shoot them  marisha okay heres what im going to propose we split up three on one guy three on the other  well do the plan that worked when we were doing it on kids and we didnt know we were doing it on  kids me and you can throw up a bottle rocket that will be the signal we attack both of the  guys at the same time two different sides  sam thats loud we could just do message we can send each other /none/ a message thats silent  marisha but if its loud and theyre both dead afterwards  liam no the people inside will hear it no we need silence  sumalee i could create oh were you going to say something  taliesin i know im new here and youve obviously all got some kind of hierarchy going  here of how you work this out  sam calebs in charge  taliesin that makes sense i suppose my question would be what are you really here for because  normally if im looking at a complicated problem i just think /none/ about what it is that i really want  and then i go and i do that  marisha we want to murder everyone inside and rescue the people who are trapped  sam we want to rescue the people who are trapped  taliesin well i was going to say that if you had to put one above the other if you get one thing  you get to do it  sam rescue the people in the basement  taliesin so youve got to get in and out of the basement that seems to be the conversation then /none/  is getting in and out of the basement im sure inevitably youre going to kill a whole bunch of  people in the process of that but as long as youre focused on where youre going and what  youre doing that may help with this wanton violence against phil who im sure is a terrible  person he shot an owl  sam phils friend did  ashly he thought it was funny though so hes still a dick  taliesin no that aint funny  marisha all right lets split up take these guys out  liam /none/ no its too early we need to wait  marisha jesus  liam its 1035 at night we need to wait until theyre asleep  ashly call it 1037 at this point  liam no  marisha we wait an hour and get into position  matt okay you guys wait an hour to get into position  marisha we watch the passing shadows in front of the windows  matt okay you keep an out and you do watch as the two of them theyre not perfectly in line  with each other and the second floor of the /tavern/ complex does block their vision of each other when  they are on complete opposite sides of the wall but sometimes one of them will be faster than the  other and theyll yell to the other and theyll go see each other from the opposite sides  liam how far is beauregard from me right now  matt how far is beauregard from you right now  liam did you wander away from me  marisha no im right next to you  liam whispers would you rather wait until they are sleeping in their beds before we did /none/ this  marisha yeah i was just trying to move things along  liam i dont want this one moving along right now she makes a lot of noise  ashly sorry  marisha yeah well wait well just wait an hour  ashly thats a good question im probably going to ruin any stealthiness  matt you do know from the time that youve spent here that there is no point in which the place is  unguarded from the wall  ashly theres no point at which there is  matt meaning there are shifts the perimeter sentinels /none/ that you see currently there are  usually two sets that switch off  ashly is there a time when they change  matt there is but youre not entirely certain when it was you werent really paying attention  sam you could take off your armor  marisha thats what i was thinking at least to get into place and then put it back on  matt its a lot of armor  liam if we are doing this i feel we should wait until it is late at night and wait until we see  those guards changed /none/ and then wait a little bit further for the old guards to go to sleep yeah  so theres a lot of sitting here and not moving i know we are all very anxious but we wait someone  comes out relieves these two they go to bed and then we strike all at once then we do your plan  its just delayed thats all  marisha okay until the next shift change i could use a short rest anyway  sam get on different sides of the facility  marisha i think so  liam yeah but keg /none/ you stay here  ashly and do what  liam wait  sam with two other people were splitting up so we can take them both out at the same time  liam yeah you are just waiting until some of us are able to silently take out these people on the  wall then we buy ourselves a little time while you can clink and clunk as we get closer  ashly laughs  liam its good that you find levity in the situation then we go into the inside of this wall  and take the next step /none/  ashly so its not three and three its three and two  liam well its two groups and you move less right now  ashly okay fair  marisha can i take a short rest  matt you guys can take a short rest  marisha and we watch  matt and you watch  marisha and we solidify our plan  matt mercifully depending on your intent the clouds break for a while and you have a clear  starry moonlit sky overhead that manages to create a rimlight on both the wall the  structure and the /town/ two guards and you wait and you wait and were going to take a break  liam thank goodness i have to pee so bad  matt well come back here in a second at this point might as well put the fortress out there  so thatll be waiting for you when you come back  liam lets go back to town  sumalee youre a firbolg  matt you finally found him were going to go to break here for a bit but we have our giveaway at  the break for our fantastic giveaway tonight we have /none/ the purpleheart hero vault with the celtic  knot design on it which is really pretty its magnetized open it up and you can put your dice  you can put your miniature in there ill be giving this away at the end of the break so hop  on over to the critical role chat on twitch thats twitchtvcriticalrole and enter the key  word once more than once and youll be disqualified the keyword tonight is stronghold  one word stronghold all you people in the us and canada excluding quebec throw that into the  chat and /none/ well come back with a winner as soon as we return see you in a few minutes  break  ashly banana hammock  matt a little late on the draw there but that worked out that was awesome welcome back  everybody before we jump into this we have our winner of the fantastic purpleheart hero  vault thats going to be elmosdaddy congratulations elmosdaddy well get your  information and get that out to you asap  liam elmo voice elmosdaddy  ashly sounds just the same is it the same voice  liam elmo voice giggling  /none/ matt to give you a little bit of a visual representation of the size of the base of the fortress  liam elmo voice everybodys going to die  matt thats what you see within the interior of the courtyard the wall itself resides probably  about out here  sam this is inside the wall  matt this is inside the wall  sam oh jeez  matt above that still  sam theres a second floor  matt theres a second floor  sam but it would be ridiculous to have built that also  marisha how are /none/ you lifting that  liam hes got a little board under there  matt the second floor sits right about there to give a little bit of perspective on that the  black dots on the outside by the way are where the windows are visible on the stone you guys are  currently divided on opposite ends of the outer wall watching the two guards slowly move their way  around the perimeter  marisha have they done a guard shift yet  matt not yet  liam in the interim while were waiting for that to happen im /none/ going to do two things one im  going to cast mage armor on myself and im also going to pull a book out of one of the holsters  and spend ten minutes changing frumpkin into a spider  matt all righty  ashly there arent any windows on the bottom floor at all  matt no no windows in the bottom floor there is a front double door and there is a single door in  the back that you know leads into a kitchen  marisha go charlotte go youre radiant  liam he has three hit /none/ points so i think hes actually a bigger spider than the one youre  imagining see hes right there hes very big  marisha how big is that spider  matt its a pretty big spider  liam its three hit points worth of spider  marisha that looks like a three hit point spider  liam somebody could step on it and he could still go  matt thats a four or five hitter  liam get brian foster in here with his ping pong racket  marisha thats arguably terrifying ill give it to you i was a /none/ little wrong just a little  liam i put it on beaus shoulder  marisha im not terrified of it im just saying it could be terrifying hi frumpkin  matt shortly after midnight you watch as two figures ascend from the inside of the wall  climbing up different ladders that mark the entrance and exit they both interface in a brief  conversation hushed voices and then relieve the two previous guards who then descend down on the  inside of the courtyard via those same ladders and disappear into the sour nest fortress so there  has /none/ been a guard changeover now its past midnight pushing one in the morning what would  you like to do  sam how are we split up groupwise probably me and caleb split and then  marisha one firbolg each  sam ill take the new one  marisha well take the old one  sam oh hey look  marisha table and table  sam while were waiting ive asked the deuce  taliesin im already regretting the name  sam are you married  taliesin no  sam did you go to college  taliesin what  sam /none/ how old are you really  taliesin i dont really know how to answer that question  sam do you have kids  taliesin no  ashly why are you badgering him with questions  sam well hes a new friend and i talk when im nervous  ashly why dont you let him think and answer questions one at a time  sam youre right  taliesin thank you  ashly sure well im learning from i dont know who actually none of us are good at this  nila i guess  sam nila is really good at /none/ this shes great  sumalee what am i good at  marisha i dont know i can only hear muffles choice words i think theyre talking about you though  sumalee its okay  liam i pull the haversack off and say i have a decent idea anyway i think that you should use this  marisha oh yeah  matt much like how you spend a moment with your smell bag you watch as beauregard seems to focus into  this strange vibrant pink satchel or shoulder bag that caleb has been carrying  sumalee what is inside  /none/ matt about a minute passes before beauregard pulls back away this strange trance passing over her  marisha death is weird am i right  sumalee what did you do to her  liam back to my idea okay nott on the other side can probably put a bolt in that guys throat  over there you can probably vault up the side of that wall if im not mistaken dont you think  marisha how tall are you  sumalee 72 maybe 76  marisha would you be willing to give me a boost up that wall  sumalee /none/ absolutely  liam oh you told me about your ability to make things quiet around you  ashly damn shouldve gone with nila  sam you married what kids do you have  ashly i was married once it lasted like an hour  taliesin i bet it was a really good hour  ashly yeah she sobered up and she said that she made a mistake  liam when i hold him you yank him off of the wall and then humpty dumpty you know they cant  put him back you know how it goes  marisha copy /none/  sumalee wait im sorry i need that one more time but ill get it  liam you are going to help beauregard here up onto the wall quietly after you use your  sumalee pass without a trace  liam whatever you call it then she gets up there and i am going to use my tricks to hold him and  let her rip him off the wall and split his skull upon the stones beneath  sumalee excellent  marisha also the thing i was looking at our version of the smell bag its like this artifact /none/  that we got from an assassin that lets you look into the creation of space and time and the universe  liam pretty complicated  marisha yeah  sumalee wow  marisha anyway  liam i pull out a little wire and whisper into it to nott and say i think we have an idea over  here so we should probably get set  ashly we havent come up with a plan yet  sam well get ready over here give us one second  ashly and sam how tall is our firbolg  taliesin singing how tall /none/ is my firbolg seven feet  matt seven to seven and a half feet  ashly we could just copy their plan  sam i mean i can just shoot  ashly oh you can just shoot never mind  sam if i miss then backup plan is boosty to you  ashly can you im like 200 plus  taliesin im not that strong  liam well shes a party maker noise you know clanking  sam you cant shoot anything  taliesin i can do some magic  ashly i have javelins  sam oh you have a /none/ javelin  ashly i forgot i had javelins yes i have javelins  sam i guess thats our plan b then  ashly didnt do too hot in the last one  sam is there anything that either of you can do to hold silence or assist me as i shoot this fellow  ashly i could give you thumbs up as youre doing it  sumalee if i cast pass without a trace can it help them too  matt unfortunately you guys are on the opposite sides of this  taliesin ive got a guiding bolt but its /tavern/ very bright and its made of light  sam lets not do that  taliesin i have some insects but they make a lot of noise  sam okay its fine its on me its okay ill just get super drunk  taliesin actually i have something i can do while thats happening  liam matthew  matt yes  liam dm where would you say in relation to this map the two groups are  matt the two groups would be probably on the outskirts of the wall here and here  liam so 150 feet apart probably  /none/ matt quite a distance  marisha how far does your message work  liam like about that far  marisha so we wouldnt be out a message range of each other  sam message is 120 feet  matt about 120 feet  liam ayy  marisha when i get up there and grab him im going to bash his head in and im going to throw  him down and if hes still alive you get him  sumalee with my shillelagh  marisha and sumalee grunting  matt well say you can manage to adjust yourselves to get /none/ within range  liam when you get on the wall off of nilas shoulders and you do the handhold thing you know  what im talking about  marisha i was figuring i would be on her shoulders and we would suck up against the wall  sam i take out a piece of wire and send a little message  liam right underneath him  marisha well see yeah right underneath him  sam caleb provided this plan works after we knock down the folks someone on each party should  put on their cloak and resume their guard /none/ pattern and keep walking around the wall  sumalee very sneaky  liam that is an excellent idea  sam you can respond oh you did  liam yeah you and i were good we have this little routine beauregard can do that on this  side what about on your side you youre short  marisha keg  liam and sam shes short  marisha but not as short as nott  taliesin you could stand on top of me  ashly are these guys humans these guards  matt make a perception check yawns pardon me  ashly /none/ 20 baby  matt one of them is human though maybe 5 12 feet tall the other because of the moonlight  thats coming through you have a better perspective on him even at this distance you  guess probably halfelven or just a very thin human a little over 6foot so you have a 6foot  one and one thats 5 12 feet  sam maybe firbolg could hunch over and stalk around  sumalee as a firbolg you have the ability no to disguise yourself every firbolg does to  shrink a little bit if you want  /none/ sam she says to caleb who tells me who tells him  sumalee sorry  marisha pass it along  taliesin yeah i guess i can do that  sam okay  ashly im very strong i could maybe hoist you  sam oh yes see youve got a plan now  ashly we made up a plan too  liam what are you doing over there nott  sam were going to shoot the man and then drunky smoky keg is going to pick up the deuce and hes  going to walk around  ashly is my nickname /none/ drunky smoky keg  sam were working on a better one  ashly its not even a nickname its three times longer than my normal name how about keg my  normal name  taliesin its literally one syllable i feel like thats not a lot to ask  liam nott i have a question for you the plan is not foolproof but on our side over here  beauregards going to throw the asshole off the wall if you shoot your asshole and he does not  die but starts screaming what do you do  sam other than /none/ shoot him again we have a javelin and that is all weve got  ashly i have rope so i could tie the rope around the javelin shoonk and pull him off the wall  marisha makeshift harpoon thats pretty cool  sam sure lets do it  ashly is that now a leading plan  sam no im still going to shoot and youre going to be ready with jav  liam or you could attack at the same time  ashly thats true  liam said liam  marisha lets just do this come on  ashly okay /none/ i tie the rope around the javelin  sam you message me a countdown and ill say it out loud to you  ashly im very scared  marisha were going to wait for our guys to pace  liam yeah the sequence of events is that you two need to get onto the wall successfully  marisha uhhuh with pass without a trace  liam youve got your javelin tied up  ashly its ready its roped  matt battleoptimal position  sam and marisha theyre here  liam i say three two one  marisha go pass without /none/ a trace  sam three two one go  liam no are they in place  marisha were going  sumalee shes on my shoulders  marisha im on her shoulders im up against this fucking wall youre doing this im going to try  and grunt  ashly then were shooting at the same time  sam were shooting at the same time  liam im going to hold hold person until these two are right under the guard  marisha i want to wait until right after he passes and then i want to do some ninja stuff /none/  sam are you just sipping tea  taliesin yep  matt first i need you to make a stealth check because youre having to move right up against the  wall this is a tenfoot clearing  marisha i do  liam use the dodeca if you need to  marisha thats true  matt both of you guys roll stealth checks  marisha mmm  sumalee doesnt she get a plus ten to the stealth  matt it is a plus ten to stealth check  marisha then that gives me a 20 total okay 20  sumalee /none/ oh shit how did i get the same thing look  marisha i cursed you  sam you need to stealth too  liam luck you have luck still  matt whats your total  ashly does that apply to her the pass without a trace  liam and matt yeah  liam but you have a luck left  sumalee i have two luck points left but i feel like  matt no you have one because you used one last game  ashly but we short rested didnt we  sumalee oh we rested  matt its a /none/ long rest to come back  liam you got one left  ashly farts  sumalee i think i need to hold that  matt so 15 and 20 youre throwing a javelin and youre firing  sam yeah  ashly okay  matt you both run up to the wall you go ahead and hoist up hanging on the edge right there  walks past doesnt seem to have noticed the both of you  sumalee and marisha woo  matt rolled a six on his perception would you both make your attack rolls please because you  are /none/ unseen you have advantage on the attack  ashly on three  liam no caleb seeing this wouldve went drei zwei eins hold person  ashly that is a 15  matt that just hits  sam natural 20  ashly hell yes  sam but you said advantage so that was a three  matt it was with advantage roll again just in case you want to crit  ashly a one no  matt no not at all lets roll your sneak attack

there is a /none/ very slight sound of both their  bodies impacting in the dirt but youre not sure if that managed to reach as far as anybody within  the interior of the stronghold what do you do now in this moment  sam mr deuce put on this cloak if you dont mind and climb up onto there and patrol around  if you dont mind  taliesin this deuce things weird i dont  sam mr clay  marisha i do the same thing i slip into the guard uniform  taliesin do you think maybe were going to want /none/ some of these clothes at some point  sam you can put his cloak on right now  taliesin oh im really tall but

wall cloaked where /none/ do you want to go  marisha i look over at deuce and give a nod  taliesin you said that out of game and i cant say anything about it  liam i send frumpkin up into the air to do a circle around the entire perimeter  matt perception check with advantage please  ashly does this mean that they can see in the windows on the second story now  matt if they want to they can try  liam achtzehn 18  matt okay there does not appear to be any person in the courtyard those /none/ two guards are the only  two that were currently set on the outside you can see the horses that were pulling the carts  that are set over on the side at the moment you can see the carts that have since been repaired  and are currently waiting in rest you can see the front door to the stronghold and you can see the  back door  liam frumpkin saw all of this yeah saw the doors all of that im going to creep my way to  the front door and as i go im going /none/ to cast detect magic  matt youre still on the outside of the wall  liam yeah  matt you have to make your way through the perimeter of the wall which has its own front  gate which is closed do you want to head to that  liam right to the outer wall  matt the outer wall and out that way okay cast detect magic  liam yeah i will wait until i am within 30 feet of the wall and then i do so i will mutter a few words  taliesin i get a free /none/ disguise self that doesnt actually count against any of my slots  matt correct  liam sexy  taliesin im going to be a guard im going to be the guy we just snuffed  matt easy enough to do  liam i like this guy  taliesin thats cool i havent done this  matt as you give the deuce your nod you watch as his form actually shifts smaller and matches the  shape of the previous guard  sam mr clay  ashly cool trick  matt finishing your detect magic you do not detect anything magical /none/ of the outer gate it is locked  ashly are we going in together should we do back entrancefront entrance  marisha i can unlock the front entrance for you guys  liam i take my wire and i say nott are you on the ground still can you meet me at the front  gates quietly  sam yeah give us a minute i am going to rifle through the dudes pockets and go through the guy  we just killeds stuff  matt okay make an investigation check because youre doing this quickly  sam 15  matt /town/ 15 not too bad  marisha do we want to go front entranceback entrance  matt you manage to pilfer about 62 gold pieces  sam 62  matt yes  sam why is he so rich  matt because you caught him at the moment outside of the town and he had his money on him  sam but does he have anything else useful like keys  matt no keys on him no  marisha yeah make sure we get the gold out of our dudes pockets youre right there on the ground  sam okay cool anything /none/ else  matt he felt safe on that wall  sam anything else useful no  matt the crossbow that he had seems to have snapped in the process of his body being yanked  from the top of the wall his armor is standard leather armor  sam okay great  marisha is there anything on the dudes armor that i put on  matt you didnt stop to check youre already up on the wall  sumalee i can check  matt if you want to make an investigation check  sumalee 17 what do i add  /none/ marisha investigation  sumalee and marisha minus one  sumalee 16  matt 16 okay you find 22 gold pieces  sumalee

up there lets go but be stealthy  matt id like you both to roll stealth check with disadvantage  sam wait with advantage  matt disadvantage for her because of her armor  /none/ liam oh son of a fuck come on ash  sam and liam okay  liam dont go lower than that thats got to be the worst  sam that was the worst still not great  ashly this is the worst  sam no  liam seven plus  ashly seven plus five  matt okay 12 good to know  marisha i say meet at the front gate  sumalee okay  matt youre going stealth as well roll a stealth check please  ashly oh god whyd i get plate armor  marisha i think you still /none/ have pass without a trace on  matt you do so thats plus ten  sumalee oh thank goodness thank you  marisha lasts for like ten minutes i think  sumalee 14  marisha lasts for an hour  sumalee and matt up to an hour  sumalee okay so this is four plus ten  matt okay eventually the four of you meet towards the front gate seemingly from what you  can tell no ones noticed  taliesin from my vantage point im going to see if theres anybody in the courtyard or if theres  anything /none/ since im up there now  matt make a perception check  marisha i signal to deuce i dont know what else to call you  taliesin clay if you have to  marisha clay  taliesin caduceus clay 16  matt okay  marisha hey look at the windows too  taliesin theyre nice  sam oh no  taliesin im looking in the windows  matt okay you see nobody else inside the courtyard you occasionally see the flickering  movement it looks like firelight is the source of light thats coming through the two windows on the /none/  two sides of the facility you can see no movement yet  marisha okay im going to slowly start pacing around towards the front im also going to look  into the windows do i see anything from my vantage point  matt make a perception check  marisha natural 20 thanks gil  matt okay you feel like you have a pretty good eye on those two sides of the interior windows  you do not see any movement yet but youre pretty locked on what are the four of you guys doing now  that youve met /none/ at the front gate  liam were at the front gate  matt yes  liam okay i can get this open but i would prefer to preserve my reserves so can you get  this door open  sam sure ill pick the lock 16 plus stuff its plus four plus three or something like that is  that right  matt thats your dexterity modifier plus your proficiency modifier  sam yeah plus seven  matt all right yeah  sam so 23  matt 23 okay you take a moment and there are two specific locks that /none/ are chained one on each  side that are closed the one thats nearest to you easy enough the one on the opposite side  you have to pull out one of your metallic hooks that slips through a space in the wood and manage  to pull it up on the side a little bit youre essentially reversepicking it with two hooked  picks from the opposite side it takes you a little longer until eventually it hangs  liam i miss being a rogue every day  sam so far everythings going great  ashly why did you /none/ say that  sam and we should assume that everything will continue to go great  ashly oh god okay  liam i pull out the wire and get it between my hands and whisper up to beauregard are we good  is everything good up there from what you can see are we good  marisha coast looks clear i dont know why i did this with my fingers  ashly okay now we have a choice we could just try to go downstairs and get your friends  liam there is another door over there lets get to /none/ that door  ashly the back door  liam were at the front gate  matt you guys are over there  ashly oh duh okay all right  matt youre making your way into the courtyard now  liam yeah so we have to get to that door  matt this door or this door your choice  ashly thats the front  matt thats the front  taliesin or you could meet me at the corner since im walking around the oh im on the  outer im not in the center area yet  matt technically beau /none/ you guys are walking perimeter on the outside wall the rest of you  cats are currently essentially over that way you guys have just passed through the gate on that  side where its open and allowing you into the courtyard  sam caleb i trust you where do we go back  liam theres no magic on the front door right  matt youre still focusing as you come inside  liam its like ten minutes so ive probably got four or five minutes left  matt yeah no magic that you notice on the front door of /none/ the fortress  liam i think that we should cut around the side and go to the back they will probably be  expecting that less  ashly that leads into the kitchen too there shouldnt be anyone in the kitchen  liam yeah okay  sam okay but wait can we get beau and mr clay down here as well to help  liam i think we should leave them for the moment to keep appearances up  sam well then in that case can you carry keg  ashly oh yeah could you carry me  sumalee i /none/ would love to  liam okay but are you able to i dont understand your peoples ways but are you able to  help her the way you helped beauregard earlier  sam oh yes you could use that spell that you used earlier  liam that ability you had to make beauregard  marisha its within 30 feet of her so yeah i think she should be good but i think you have to  cast it on the people within 30 feet of you  sam recast  matt for the duration each creature you choose within 30 /none/ feet of you  liam so you could drop it and do it again  sam wait for the duration  marisha for the duration each creature you choose within 30 feet  liam who has it now  taliesin i think its as long as theyre within 30 feet its like a field and you can say yea or  nay thats my view  matt it doesnt say at the moment of casting you have to select just that for the duration you  choose so my interpretation i would allow someone to step into the radius and /none/ you could  then choose  sam okay so we know better we know you dont have to cast it  ashly ill snuggle up to nila  sumalee i choose keg  liam lets tippytoe around the back door  sam okay lets go  matt all right everyone whos now making their way around the back make another stealth check  ashly am i at disadvantage now still  matt youre still at disadvantage because you still have your armor  ashly so two plus ten plus five 17  liam i miss vax so much  sam /none/ 23  liam 14  taliesin plus ten  liam plus ten whatever it is  sumalee 12  matt okay you guys begin to head around this direction  liam yeah  matt all right going past the barrel pile where you had previously made your way in and out via  owl the previous day as you guys scoot past you hear the front door of the facility thudding  creaking it opens ever so faintly to the inside and a figure peers out having apparently  heard something  marisha we dont see that  sam no /none/ we already went  liam no these two we asked them if they saw anything right before we went  marisha i didnt see that  matt you see a figure poke the head out and look curiously  taliesin sorry  matt what make a deception check with advantage given that fact that its in the  darkness and not an unexpected scenario  taliesin natural 20  ashly hell yes  matt guard looks past and closes the door  ashly oh my god im going to have an ulcer after this game  taliesin nah  matt /none/ you guys all continue to the back of the facility  ashly except keg  sumalee no you are with me were together  matt you guys are at the back door  liam im going to guess that i have two or three minutes left on detect magic so does the door  seem clear of that  matt the door seems to be clear of magic  taliesin who do i see on the front door by the way really what did he look like i dont know  who he was but  matt from what you /none/ can look at it looked to be humanoid it was hard to tell at this distance  with the little bit of firelight you saw hood was down short black hair looked a bit sallow  young but probably looked older than they were  marisha kill it kill it  ashly aww damn  matt nah that would have been cool  liam it was on my ipad  matt i should have run with it youre at the back door  liam luck luck luck is there any gap between the bottom of the door and the floor /none/ that frumpkin  could fit through right now  matt there is a very faint bit that a spider could fit though yes  liam in you go buddy hold on to my hand please  ashly we could do a hand chain  sam youre not with us  taliesin aww damn it  liam telepathically i tell frumpkin to crawl up the other side of the door and go onto the ceiling  matt all right frumpkin is now up and there is a kitchen  taliesin sandwiches  sam what  matt there is a kitchen you /none/ can see there is an oven there looks to be a bunch of dirty dishes  that have just piled up and havent been washed in a while there is a path that goes to the right  and further down this hallway and there is a door that leads further in  liam nila didnt tell us anything about a kitchen from her  marisha yeah she did  marisha the hallway down the right is the one we want to go to if i remember correctly  sumalee with the trapdoor  marisha with the trapdoor yep  /none/ liam well thats where i will send frumpkin along the ceiling then when he gets to a door he  can go down the door and under if there is a gap and then up the door  matt okay thats through into this hallway which currently ends in two more doors this way  and that way  liam are all these doors so far the same they are loose  matt they are loose i mean as far as small gaps in between very very tiny  liam a halfinch for frumpkin  matt yep  ashly would /none/ i be able to tell him which way to go  matt he wouldnt be able to hear you  liam i dont hear shit right now i will send frumpkin through the next gap  matt which one theres two different doors this way or this way  liam no you cant tell me anything  taliesin here have a laser pointer  sam here is a laser pointer liam obrien  liam i will do this one here  matt all right frumpkin moves into this chamber which unveils this chamber in this chamber you  see a /tavern/ dining area of some kind and you see there are two of the hired guards in the process of  finishing an evening drink  sam was it phil and the other guy  marisha is it phil  matt one of them is phil one of them is the other guy looks like theyre having a nightcap  ashly are they drunk  matt theyve been drinking you have no idea if theyre drunk frumpkin sees the two of them  hushedly chatting to one other and drinking from tankards  liam i will have frumpkin back away under /none/ the crack  matt okay make a stealth check for frumpkin because now you are in eyesight of  liam he is so little he is so small  matt i know  liam just one roll thats okay hold on everybody 14 wait everythings crazy i need a  different browser window  matt what did you roll  liam well i rolled a 14 but its better than that its 16  matt thats fine they do not see fumpkin they have had just enough to drink where they did not  see frumpkin  liam singing the /none/ itsy bitsy spider  matt frumpkin is going where  liam back under that door and he will peekypoo under the door he has not checked yet  matt okay that leads into another chamber a hallway that continues down and then seems to  open into another walkway  liam yeah this door this one here  matt frumpkin goes and opens that one which leads into another hallway a very small chamber  and there are a couple of odd pieces of dried goods in the corners and a wooden trapdoor  liam to the bottom  sam /none/ trapdoor to the bottom  matt seems to be a trapdoor  liam any cracks that are a halfinch wide big enough for a spider  matt no  liam i remember this okay thats a wall covered by that paper there that you dont need to  uncover right  matt that is a wall yes  liam back out of this i know where i am i will go along the wall here frumpkin will crawl on the  wall oh you cant see where im pointing  matt on the wall over here  liam yeah and /none/ crawl around the corner and peek around the corner into that colored spot  matt okay revealing that it looks and you can see this has been storage because frumpkin  entered this is all kitchen storage and looking down this hall  liam this is too complicated for me to mutter so im not telling everybody this this is too complicated  matt that is the gist of what youve seen  sam wow thats the whole layout frumpy  matt you dont know how much of this will stay  sam sure glad we chose a spider  /none/ marisha i take back mocking you for your choice  liam i dont hear anything and youre nowhere near me what i will do is send frumpkin down this  hallway because i did not go this way yet  matt turning around this way you can see the spiral staircase the very same where you had  briefly managed to dodge lorenzo earlier in the day heading up to the second floor  liam i remember this from her stories so i will continue frumpkin up the stairs  sam up the stairs oh god why why would you /none/ do that  liam time is passing because hes not that quick  matt right as frumpkin passes that way this door opens up and one of the two guards heads this  way a little sloppy but turns and  liam well make for the wall at that point  matt ew he starts walking up and goes in to try and step on frumpkin  liam what does frumpkin need to do armor class right  matt yeah whats frumpkins armor class  liam zwölf  matt with disadvantage thats 12 it goes ahead and stomps down thats /none/ a hit point  liam he scurries away no he scurries up onto the wall up onto the ceiling  matt whats the speed for frumpkin  liam 20 feet  matt okay the guard is like ugh hey phil  laughter  matt what whats the problem theres a fucking spider in here  liam theres a bug in this world and i wont rest until hes dead  taliesin the most realistic thing ive ever  matt heads back into the room and comes back with these two metal tankards that are dinged up and  they both /none/ start throwing them up to try and smash the spider with that the first one misses and  clatters down the stairs  liam matt i dont know if this will happen in time but what i tell him to do telepathically  because i should be close enough 100 feet is to go in here through this door thats open and  over the door and down the back and once hes out of sight i will poof him out if that works they  might hit him before it happens  matt well the first two slams or /none/ tossing of tankards clanging loudly do not hit  marisha i thought it was going to blow our cover  liam its a spider  matt they both turn around and follow like where did it go its this way and they both  come back inside the room trying to follow where frumpkin went  liam but he disappears in the back of the door  matt they both look around like shit ugh i cant sleep now with that thing around here keep  looking thats the last thing that frumpkin hears before vanishing  sam oh boy /none/  liam that was wild okay yes oh hi again theres two of them i pull a wire out and i aim  towards my friends on the horses theres two of them six seconds go by theres two of them on  the first floor what do we do  sam what do we do now should we go in  ashly do we have any sense if their clanging disturbed anything  matt make a perception check  sam did you see a way to downstairs  ashly 14  matt youre listening right now you dont hear /none/ anything but youre also on the opposite side of  where anybody else would be so you have no idea  liam i saw what the firbolg woman told us about there is a trapdoor not too far from us here  sam why dont we go try to get down to it  liam whispers ja okay thats good we have to be very quiet  sumalee there may be murderers inside the trap door  liam heres what we do frumpkin i take frumpkin oh theres frumpkin i place frumpkin  on your shoulder  sam yes  /none/ liam you have to go in this door and im going to talk into your ear im going to hold kegs  shoulder and i am going to talk into your ear and tell you which way to go to get you to the  trapdoor okay and you have to be very quiet  ashly by yourself  liam yeah and see if that trapdoor is open if it is you will put my spider underneath and we  will see what is going on  sam if the trapdoor is open  liam if its unlocked  sam /none/ oh if its unlocked okay got it  liam do not go in yourself right away send in frumpkin to look i will be watching the whole time  sam all right  matt are you drinking to the point of intoxication  sam no just one big swig  matt all righty  sam okay lets go  matt all right  sam got to pick a lock first or check the door  matt make an investigation check on the door  sam 24  matt 24 the door is indeed locked  sam i will try to /none/ pick it  matt go ahead and roll for that plus six  sam it was 22  matt thats still enough anyways  sam that does not work  matt what did you roll  sam it was a two plus whatever i said before seven  matt no you fear breaking one of your lockpicks you remove it  sam i cant do it  liam its fine  sam ooh push open the door with your massive strength  ashly the noise  liam halt i cast  sam can you get us in  liam ja /none/ i cast knock on the door  sumalee i was just looking  matt as you guys are having this conversation you see caleb flicker his hands through the air  his eyes focused in a distant stare for a moment you see this strange blue energy sparkle around  the outside of the doorknob and the door opens  sam wait did you cast a spell oh oh wow okay that was easy all right focus up  ashly nott be careful  sam you care about me  ashly yeah  liam at every turn listen to me /none/ at every turn when you can go left or right if frumpkin who  will be resting on your ear tickles the inside of the ear it means go right if nothing happens go left  sam inside tickle right  liam tickle means right  sam nothing left liam eats farts im ready  liam youve got it  sam got it  liam and sam tickle means right  marisha i do another check to see if i see any movement upstairs  matt youre still keeping tabs on it im not going to have you roll just /none/ for consistently staring  marisha i just want to make sure  matt okay you do see a shadow pass by the door by the window  marisha by the window  sam i cast mage hand just in case  matt okay what do you do  sam i will go through and wait for a tickle  liam my hand is on kegs shoulder in case things go to shit  matt to the right is a hallway an open entrance that goes into a pantry or storage room to the  left is a door that leads /none/ beyond the kitchen  liam tickle means right left is nothing  sam is there a tickle  liam no  sam i will go straight  matt youre at a door  sam i will try the door  matt it opens its not locked  liam tickle tickle  matt you feel a tickle  sam i turn right  matt make a stealth check please because youre now passing within ear shot of  sam thats a one  ashly no  matt okay as you turn the corner part of your cloak seems to have caught /none/ the edge of one of the  pots that was layered on the table right here as you pull through pots start clattering you guys  watch as this whole stack of pots start pulling off into the kitchen the door here swings open  and both of these figures come rushing in hey what the hell they both pull out blades  liam i drop it were in go i walk into the building  matt all right roll initiative you guys  marisha all right  ashly oh fuck  sam the rogue blew it  marisha the /none/ rogue did blow it  liam thats not what i expected  marisha dont die  ashly ten  matt all righty 25 to 20  liam 21  marisha also 21 im actually going ahead and roll my d8 with this as well plus seven 29  sorry 28  liam did the sound of clattering pans clatter outside  matt what do you mean  marisha and taliesin did we hear it  liam did the people outside hear it  matt you guys would have heard it very faintly because the door was open and it did /none/ fill what  was normally a pretty still evening that brings us to them all right that brings us to 20 to 15  sam 15  sumalee 18  matt 18 all right nott all right 15 to ten  ashly ten  taliesin 12  marisha wait who was a 12 you  matt all right i think thats everyone top of the combat round at this moment beau youre up first  marisha okay  matt hearing this noise you are on the wall at this point keeping an eye you guys would probably  be at /none/ angles here if you maintained patrol and tried to case both sides  marisha i want to look at the window do i see that figure i just saw does it seem like the pots  and pans got that figures attention and theyre hastily moving  matt you saw them move casually past one window and then move quicker past the other  marisha okay where am i  matt youre over here on the wall  marisha im over there  matt you guys have been on the wall this whole time so youre right over here essentially /none/ about  that high  marisha okay i am going to do i try and make a distraction or run  sumalee good question  marisha im going to light one of those firecrackers again and im going to toss it this  direction towards the front of the door  sumalee yes  matt okay go ahead and make a dexterity check  marisha natural 20  matt where directly do you want to aim it  marisha i want to try and aim it to where it sounds like theres a commotion happening at this  front door /none/ to draw people this way and not at the back  matt you go ahead and you throw it it lands its going to take a second for it to go off but  it definitely seems to have rolled passed and over in the vicinity just past that corner  marisha im assuming that was my action  matt that was your action and ill say bonus action to pull it out light it and throw  marisha okay im going to use my movement to just haul ass towards these guys  matt along the wall  marisha /none/ yeah  matt all right counting thats about as far as you can get right there  marisha okay  matt ending your turn caleb youre up  liam i slap my hand down on kegs shoulder and i with a free hand stick licorice root into my  mouth and start chewing and squeeze her shoulder and you are hasted and i will a couple of  things and i cant find my card right now but you have a plus two to your ac you have advantage  on dexterity saving throws and an additional action on each /none/ of your turns  matt so you can have four attacks in a single round  liam you are very fast right now  matt and your movement is twice as much so you have 50 feet a turn  liam i start moving into the building as far as i can actually behind nott  matt ill put this on keg as a reminder so you move in counting right there  liam by the doorway yeah thats good  matt all right that finishes your go  liam pressing into the wall there so that people can get /none/ by me  matt all right one of them shouts we got company over his shoulder behind  liam oh thats terrible  matt a natural 19 on the dice going to move in here this one is going to move in as well they  are probably going to move right there theyre both going to make attacks on nott  sam sure  matt the first one is going to be a 13 to hit  sam miss  matt you duck out of the way you see the short sword they pull spark across the stone carving /none/  down the side no impact the other one uses that moment to try and swing at you thats equally  terrible thats far worse actually thats a six  sam miss  matt both of them whooshing no effect but theyre both shouting back over their shoulders  like intruder company that finishes their go nila youre up first  sumalee should i put my spirit totem now to give us extra strength  liam thats up to you  sumalee it will only get within 30 feet around so beau would not be covered  marisha im coming /none/ into you though im coming into you guys  sumalee so when she moves into that nila wants to go inside  matt you move inside counting  sumalee as close as i can get toward the trapdoor  matt 25 30 you can get right into that doorway right there  sumalee

this show right  matt you manage to just lift the trapdoor enough to slide your hand underneath there is a trigger  cable underneath that has been set into a hook right before it pulls taut enough for it to snap  you grab it lift it up put it onto a shoulder using the cable you pull it back until you find a  piece of rock off to the side and hook it to it to where it maintains the tautness you find another  metal ring that is designed specifically to hold /none/ the trap when its not set it does not go off  the trapdoor opens and there is a staircase that descends to a lower floor  sam see just easy as that  liam is it open  sam its open lets go in  liam open it no i hold up frumpkin i place him on the edge of the trapdoor and send him  scrambling under to look  matt okay make a perception check for frumpkin  marisha im still watching this front area  liam 15  matt 15 okay frumpkin descends slowly down the /none/ stairs theres a faint bit of torchlight in  there you hear whimpering a few voices faintly whimpering inside the chamber i can show you actually  sam wait what no you had the upstairs built matt you didnt have the downstairs built that  would be too much  matt ill be right back  groaning  sam guys dd beyond  liam we learned so much  sam weve learned so much about hey taliesin welcome back to the show  taliesin thank you its great to be back  marisha will you show

just above  the table waiting to drop in and we all thought it would happen near the end of the episode but  it didnt it didnt how does it feel to finally let that little bit of rope cut and be in the game again  taliesin ive got to say its been a little nerve wracking coming in as someone new its very interesting /none/  liam i like this guy  taliesin i like this guy too  marisha i like this guy a lot  ashly hes awesome  sam his voice is sexy  ashly he had such a great intro  liam i like pink more than purple if i can say  taliesin i like it all so im a fan  marisha do you really like pink more than purple like as a person  liam yes  marisha i cant tell if youre lying to me or not  liam i like pink a little more than purple /none/  taliesin i was very happy with the pink mohawk it was a very good mohawk it was blacklight reactive  ashly really  sam oh matts back  matt so hi guys frumpkin slowly descends the staircase and you can see a rack that is bolted  into the wall that has chains hanging from it a few other sets of manacles a few torture  implements long metal things that are hooked at the end brands there are a few spaces that are  currently empty where tools probably would normally hang and there is another door that /none/  leads to a chamber beyond and thats where you hear the whimpering coming from  liam what i dont like about this is that the asshole was sleeping upstairs and we dont know  about that at all but i send frumpkin along the ceiling and through that looks like a barred gate  matt as frumpkin looks within you can see another chamber you can see another hired figure  at least the same cloaked individuals you had encountered before same attire who is currently  sitting at the back up against the wall and is looking in /none/ the direction of the door expectantly  liam i will attempt to send frumpkin over his head along the ceiling stealthily  matt make a stealth check for frumpkin frumpkin also noticed there is a cage in the corner that  contains two figures in there looks to be two humanoid figures  liam humanoid thats it  matt with that perception roll and the low light its hard to tell one appears to be larger one  appears to be smaller  sam yasha and jester  liam im going to keep going and you said roll  matt /none/ make a stealth check  liam very good that is a 19  matt okay unnoticing he sits there waiting arm against the wall frumpkin slowly makes his way  through this hallway it bends off on a corner around the side frumpkin continues beyond and it  curves around another corner here there is an archway that leads into another room that has two  more cages that contain each cage contains another figure the figures in there appear to be  slumped down and either unconscious or sleeping  liam yeah he pauses hes looking for green or /none/ blue or goth  matt here  liam ja  matt you see ruzza and protto two more members of the iron shepherds that are currently waiting  there with their eyes towards the entryway expectantly it seems that they have been notified  of your presence  sam how  matt i dont know maybe the loud firecrackers going off right above  taliesin what do they do those two what do those two do  sam theyre bad ones a magic person  liam so would frumpkin be at the edge of that gate  matt frumpkin would /none/ be here  liam i rolled a 19 last we checked and that was 20 seconds ago  matt as theyre both standing there waiting protto the little halfling sharpshooter creep  glances up and goes takes his shortbow and  liam do i see this  matt pulls it off his shoulder mmhmm  liam popping  matt yeah thats the last you see  liam there are more people down there this is the xfactor we spoke about  marisha how many  liam i saw two down there correct  ashly three right  matt one in /none/ that chamber and then two in there  liam right but i mean in that last room  matt in that last room it was two  liam and i did not see lazlo so he could be upstairs  sam lorenzo  liam no its lazlo im pretty sure  laughter  liam i didnt see el boogie down there so he could be upstairs or downstairs is what im saying  sam but then you saw some prisoners  ashly dwelmas dead we just beat the barbarian protto and ruzza are down there that means  lorenzo is /tavern/ upstairs unless hes  sam or somewhere  liam we do not know that we know that there is one random shithead and two more beyond that and  i did not see lorenzo or lazlo or larkin  ashly lorenzo  marisha so hes either still upstairs or deeper further  liam yeah hes either behind us or down below  marisha or hes not here at all and hes at the bar that he likes to hang out at  sam the trench  marisha called the trench fuck you so close i was almost there  sumalee /none/ what about prisoners  liam ja there were some people in cages but i did not get a good look at them through my  spiders eyes  sam we cant close this door that nila just exploded but we can put up some sort of person to  watch so some of us can go down there and snoop around and maybe kill that one guard that you spotted  liam here is what i think we have a bit of a bottleneck here at this trapdoor if they want to  come up they have to deal with /none/ us ja  sam yes  liam so if the majority of us wait at this trap door and i send my spider upstairs to see whats  going on to see if our friend is up there we can learn about upstairs and if anyone pokes their  head out of that door theyre going to lose it  ashly that seems like a good plan to me  liam lets keep figuring things out  sam okay  matt all right so are you sending frumpkin upstairs  liam yeah  sam any ideas mr clay  taliesin /none/ well i mean could just ask him to open the door the ruckus has stopped and obviously  somebody won this fight  marisha we have the trapdoor open though right  taliesin yeah  sam but the gate down there  taliesin i can do that if you like  marisha how about everyone get ready  liam close it quietly and if anyone has a look around  taliesin i can just go down and ask i was going to mention i do look like a guard right now  marisha you do so do i we still /none/ look like guards  taliesin im grabbing a little muck putting it on my face getting all i could just go down if you like  marisha why dont we bring this guard up here to us  liam wait its true you look like one of the guys upstairs you could go down and tell them  but well you are putting a lot on the line for people youve just met tonight  taliesin yeah its okay  liam yeah  taliesin yeah  marisha why dont we handle this guard first and i go here lift up /none/ the gate lift up the trapdoor  taliesin im going to go down  marisha youre going down  taliesin yeah  marisha you dont want to bring him up okay  matt so you go ahead and descend the stairs into this chamber  liam simultaneously caleb will slap his hand down on kegs shoulder and send frumpkin on the  ceiling or on the first floor towards the stairwell at the front of the building  matt okay  marisha im going to go down with clay but just at the stairs since i also look like a /none/ guard  matt okay so you stay at the stairs there beau  marisha yep  matt all right as you glance through clay you can see the faint light in here you can see the  figures walking up to the cage eyes still trained on the door  taliesin im just tapping on the doors all clear we got one its keg well handle it im  going to head back upstairs  matt make a deception check  taliesin all right  marisha does he have advantage  matt no its allowing him to do one  /none/ taliesin thats cocked  sam that was cocked  matt i

matt opens the door  taliesin as i head up through the trapdoor im like get ready everyone just when he comes up  and just walking a little way past  marisha /none/ i go just follow him  matt steps up

crossbow bolt jammed into his shoulder and past  the rib and hes having a hard time breathing  taliesin oh no just going to turn him into mulch thats okay  laughter  matt you watch as clay hushing as he just slowly pushes his face in with his fist repeatedly  taliesin im going to drag him back we got another suit if anyone wants one  ashly well nila you can disguise yourself right  nila yes  ashly we could have two guards  matt caleb what are you doing  liam frumpkin is still /tavern/ climbing towards the stairwell up and i am computing everything that  our druid friend told me about the stairs to see if big man is asleep in his room  matt so you coast around here  sam all the maps  taliesin and liam singing so many maps  matt make your way through down this hall to the bedroom where you had

boy its hard to say because the map is gone but i think  what i will do is ill drop out of frumpkin for a moment and i have 30 feet of movement so i will  walk 25 feet towards those stairs  matt toward the stairs where frumpkin was  liam yeah  matt okay  liam yeah towards the second floor  matt all right youre at the base essentially or near the staircase that leads up and out to  this space there  liam oh wow if /none/ im able i will stand on my own and go back into frumpkin and wait because he is  far ahead of me frumpkin and my friends are mostly behind me but im okay  matt all right

my mouth and start chewing furiously anxiously im so scared of everything and cast  haste again into the dwarf  ashly /none/ tight  matt okay so you have one minute before that spell goes away  liam one minute ja i know you are again on methamphetamines  ashly perfect  matt okay as you enter this lower chamber you come in with a fair light you look over on the  table and there are the implements there you step out and there is a moment where you touch your  foot to the ground and something gives way you see a cable that was run through the ground  quickly whip up the air and you glance up to /none/ see heavy netting that contains a bunch of broken  brick and stone that falls down from the center of the chamber i need both nott and nila to make  dexterity saving throws please  sam were not still under the influence of any sort of thing  matt it only lasts a nice  sumalee 21  sam 11  matt 11 thats a failure on your point that is eight points of bludgeoning damage to you four  points to you as this pile of stone fills the corner you guys manage to step off to the /none/ side  and pull yourself out of the rubble but you get the sense now that this room is definitely trapped  and there is definitely an awareness within and deeper of your presence nila as you recover from  this you glance up and see the cage in the corner that you had passed when you first entered and you  see a hand hanging off one of the metal bars a tiny familiar hand a bit of fur that covers  and vanishing into the faint grayishblue tint of what is asars hand  sumalee i want to /none/ go to him to touch him but i want to make sure that theres nothing that is  going to trigger something else  matt make an investigation check  sumalee oh im so nervous 19  matt and marisha thats cocked  sumalee groans  marisha yeah sorry it was almost good  sumalee eight  matt plus  sumalee plus my which check  matt investigation  sumalee nine oh no minus one seven shit should i use my luck point now  liam no your

home  matt well you still pick the one you want to so you go with the previous one you dont have to pick  the one pretty sure thats how the luck feat works right  liam thats right whatever one you want  matt from best you can tell there is nothing no contraption adhered to the cage its just a /none/ cage  you come up close and look inside you can see kitor your partner is slumped in the back of the  cage unconscious with what little bit of light is in here as you focus you have darkvision so you  can see in his unconscious face he is still breathing but there are wounds and scrapes you  look and see asar who is awake who is currently holding a burn puncture right in his abdomen he  looks up to you the sweat dripping down his face and goes mama mama and leans up to the /tavern/ cage  and puts his hand over the outside of the bar and reaches out for you with the other hand and  entwines his fingers mama you came  sumalee im here mamas here i want to heal them can i heal them  matt if you have a heal spell yeah  sumalee i have healing word  matt yeah  liam quietly i dont like it  matt whats your healing word to your son  sumalee quickly reading under breath  matt whats the word you

injuries slowly close up and he breathes a little heartier again and  looks at you with a renewed smile his hand still entwining /none/ your fingers and says mama i want to  go home  sumalee ill bring you home were going to get you out of here i grab that cage and try to pull  it apart as much as i can  sam let me try to unlock it  laughing  matt well make a strength check just for the hell of it because life gets weird  marisha while this is happening can i come and watch this corridor  taliesin yeah im going to come in the corridor as well  marisha im going to suck up /none/ against this wall and look to make sure no one is coming around that  hall while this is happening  taliesin since i still look like a soldier im going to be willing to be a little visible on the corner  marisha yeah actually we both look like soldiers we block this corridor looking like soldiers  matt okay you move into the corridor  marisha just backs to that corridor in this room  matt like this  marisha yup like were watching guarding this room together  sumalee strength check 19 plus two  sam wow /none/  matt you begin to strains and you watch as nilas arms pop with the muscles filling with  adrenaline and emotion as the metal bars bend ever so slightly just enough to maybe fit asar  through not your mate you pull them just enough and you reach through and he pulls his way and  you help him grab his shoulder and slowly you pull your son free from the cage and into your arms  sumalee sobs i hug him again i want to go i want to run i dont know what to do i look /none/  inside and see if theres any way that i can pull further to get kitor out too  matt the bars have gone as far as they can go and you continue to pull the emotion in there  your strength is waning from the physical exertion of getting even that bit of the metal open  sumalee can i heal him i know he has powers to help himself out of here if i heal him  matt you can try yeah  sam while she does that ill try to jimmy the bent lock  matt go /none/ for it  sam yeah thats a one  laughing  matt sam  marisha youre supposed to be good at this  matt buddy  sam you ruined the fucking lock  laughter  sam you bent it  sumalee you cant blame the mother  matt roll for healing word  taliesin just for my own giggles im going to cast detect magic really quickly because this  place is giving me the creeps  matt okay  taliesin i have an autothing i can do apparently which is nuts  matt im going to need a new /none/ ipad this thing is crashing and falling apart the whole night great job  sam im going to look around for keys or something just around the room  matt all right make an investigation check  sam thats a one  ashly oh my god you need to use a new one  marisha did you just roll two ones in a row  matt sam were not making money for charity you can slow your roll here buddy  sam 826la guys  sumalee do i roll this for  matt yeah to heal  taliesin im going /none/ to cast detect magic as a racial trait which apparently is a thing you can do  sam wow  taliesin firbolgs are amazing  sam any magic  matt in the immediate chamber  taliesin yeah  matt focusing on this you dont sense any immediate magical auras within the chamber  taliesin all right how about within 30 feet am i getting a ping  matt nothing that you can see in the immediate area no  sumalee five  matt you watch as kitor rouses one eye is swollen shut the other opens a bit and you /none/ watch  as the swelling slowly goes away from that eye its still purple from the outside but the  swelling has diminished from the healing effect of your spell and he looks up my mate he looks  down at his hands and looks out and sees that asars been freed and he looks out at the strange  crew looks towards both of you and gasps  sumalee its okay theyre safe they came to help can you get out  matt help me  sumalee how tell me  matt he stands up in the cage his /none/ hunched form is crammed in by this cage that was not designed  for his firbolg body nevertheless he reaches out and grabs the bars where you had started on  three one two three strains hes going to go ahead and make a strength check with advantage  thats a natural 17 and a natural 19 i love it when it works for the narrative  laughing  matt that puts it over 20 both of you together strains and one of the bars comes off on one  side he gets in quickly and puts his shoulder in /none/ and pushes against the other and that bends off  to the side leaving just enough room for him to push through it takes a minute and youre helping  him and grabbing his elbow and the two of your together you feel something pop in his shoulder  but its just enough to get his body to wedge out of the space and he comes back out of it and  embraces you the other arm limply hanging at one side but he takes you in his hand he looks down  at his son and looks over at /none/ the rest of you tired still amongst the trauma he has suffered  there is a pride and a silent strength to him very much similar to that youve seen in nila i  do not know by what grace youve come to us but thank you  marisha well we relied on your mate here couldnt have done it without her  sam yeah shes quite impressive  matt that she is and pets the back of your head  marisha now if i was you id run  sumalee what about your friends  marisha you have a /town/ child with you you need to get him out of here hes suffered enough weve  got it from here  sumalee thank you  marisha we wouldnt have gotten this far without you  sumalee clay  taliesin yeah  sumalee well go back to your temple will you help these people will you help these friends  taliesin yeah i like whats happening here here come on give me a hug  sumalee nila gives him a big hug  taliesin some tea for the road ive got a bit of it left  laughing  sam is /none/ it already steeped or is that just the  taliesin no its just loose leaf  sam oh okay  taliesin its not a bag its just loose leaf  matt kitor picks up asar and throws him over his shoulder now standing in his full form just  below the ceiling of this chamber taller even than clay thank you lets go home  taliesin see you soon  marisha well see you later  sumalee oh before i forget nila wears a necklace of six red feathers four of these  feathers were people from my tribe who /none/ were taken one for kitor one for asar one for duma and one  for oh shoot so emotional but i know it duma and masag masag was one of our strongest  they took him too and duma was the little one that jumnda mentioned one feather was for me for  leaving my tribe to find my family and i took an extra one because i thought i would find friends  who might help me i will give it to you i undo the feather pull it off its a perfectly intact  red feather i dont /none/ know who will take it but if you ever need our help you can come to the  temple if by chance were not there but only because one of us would go back to check on the  others of our tribe well be in the crispvale thicket just go where the moss is the thickest  and ill be there thank you for everything thank you so much  marisha well find you again nila  sumalee thank you lets go  matt good luck  sam bye  matt you watch as the three of them given /none/ a second chance at life and freedom step through  the door where you entered and vanish up the stairs the heavy footfalls dissipating as they  grow further and further from you the two of you who have been focusing that point the haste  spell having coursed into your body glance behind and see as the family steps through the  kitchen door and exits theres only one path left to find the others that were taken and thats  where well leave tonights game  sam groans  taliesin this was the best  sumalee thank you /none/ guys so much  ashly sumalee  marisha sumalee
