none	 dramatic music  matt all right then good morning and welcome everyone to this years critical role panel  cheering  matt some of us have slept some maybe not have fared so well so prepare for  audience member one point of exhaustion  travis one point of exhaustion  laughter  matt it has begun  laura with a low constitution  marisha i already have a low charisma thats not good  travis yeah we played a game in between live streams and these are all the surviving members  laura spoilers  matt can you imagine 
none	 what would happen if you played a game not on the stream and came in like  man that was a crazy adventure anyway sam shows up with a new character  laura every time the chair tips forward i feel like were going to fall  matt as an introduction to the panel who here doesnt know what critical role is raise your hand  cheering  matt thats an impressive ratio critical role is a weekly  marisha one guy one guy  matt its a weekly stream where us and a couple of other voice actors play

none	  audience member hey you guys its really weird seeing you guys in person after seeing you on screen  travis i know were so much betterlooking  matt curiously small  audience member i thought you were taller  marisha what  audience member i thought travis was going to be a little taller  travis what  laughter and applause  travis ive never heard that  audience member you sit next to laura and with the height difference you seem so much taller  travis i sit on phone books  marisha is that better does that 
none	 make you feel more comfortable  audience member my question is you guys played for a long time offstream before you guys ever  recorded on the twitch  laura wait ive got to go over here  laughter and applause  laura do i look as cool as i feel  travis no hold the wing out no more that way  laughter  matt thats really really cool so your question  marisha how has been playing on twitch different from playing our home game  audience member has it changed decisions and things knowing people are going 
none	 to judge  everything you do  travis well it changed it a little bit we try and keep the dumb pauses that would normally  happen in our sevenhour home games where were eating chips and drinking all the time and  sometimes if its not us wed get up and walk off into the kitchen and eat a bunch of cookies  and shit so we try to get rid of that stuff but whether we make stupid decisions i make those  all the time  matt yeah vox machinas ability to formulate a plan and then 
none	 succeed in executing it have not  changed theyve always failed and yet somehow succeeded in the end but yeah other than a  difference in small talk and probably the no sams always been as weird as he is not much has  changed beyond that its been nice  laura are we talking about how weird sam is  matt how things have changed or not changed from doing private games to the stream  laura did we talk about all the food we ate because we ate so much food  audience member is that a tiberius 
none	 impression right now  laura what  audience member that your tiberius impression right now  matt i do miss the morning dd mimosas a little bit were never going to get that back  marisha and the smoked salmon and lox  laura we had a whole brunch  matt weve got to bring that back  laura i would make quiches for us  marisha oh thats right the quiche  travis can we go shopping right now  laughter  travis theres more emotional stuff once the stream started thats for sure the first time  somebody 
none	 started crying even i was like what the fuck is happening  matt thats not true when ashley went down prestream there was some emotion in that sequence  marisha we can remember more now than we used to because were playing regularly whereas before we  played every six weeks or so wed take the first 30 minutes to be like matt tell us what all we  did everything  matt im so glad were past that next question  audience member love you guys  matt love you too  audience member first watching your show got 
none	 me actually into playing dungeons  dragons  cheering  audience member given the popularity of a number of things becoming more mainstream the popularity  of tv shows like the league have you guys thought about making a tv show or web series based off  your critical role outsideofcharacter in the game and incharacter playing  marisha realitystyle  audience member yeah realitystyle  laura ive always wanted cameras following me around  marisha it did get talked about at one point but it didnt go forward part of it is because we  were like and then 
none	 there is also that part where we were like ah whats really exciting on that  three and a half four hours on screen thats awesome were really boring all other times i  dont know if we want to expose that were not that cool  matt some of those cameras follow me back to my office they can watch me tear my hair out trying  to create interesting stories for you guys  laura see that actually sounds more interesting if they follow me and travis home they would get  us laying on our carpet playing 
none	 with charlie  matt wed have to put pants on  audience members no you wouldnt  matt well see where it goes the popularity has been unexpected but at the same time we want to  make sure that if theres going to be anything that comes out of this that its onbrand and  doesnt feel like its capitalizing on the show and is more a natural expansion of it so well  see we definitely dont want to jump out of the gate and be like you guys like this well try  the new breakfast cereal 
none	  laura i think that scanlan should hawk all of that stuff its onbrand for him  travis i think we should have some breakfast cereal  laura gilmores glorious granola  matt vox machinums  cheering  matt you dont know what youve done scope  travis come get at us general mills well make this happen  audience member first of all thank you for coming here as obviously were not in la so  its nice to see you here at the con i have a question for matt im looking for a reliable  source of 
none	 black powder somewhere in vasselheim  matt theres a guy who was on craigslist once that always ends well actually i think the black  powder merchant encounter is the best example you can have of fantasy craigslist in a dd setting  thats usually par for the course which is a guy going want to buy a couch come and take a  couch i have never had an npc be forcefully dragged by a community into other games victor  has been pulled into stuff yes anytime please come buy things learn from my mistakes i love  
none	 that keyleth doesnt quite know that hes missing limbs because she can probably fix it  marisha i dont think ive ever  matt youve never met him in game yeah and percy doesnt know you havent  laura you can fix peoples limbs  marisha yeah  laura wait did you have that when vax had no toes  marisha no  matt its a 6th or 7thlevel spell so you lose a finger  travis so i can chop off my arm  marisha dude its not like dont no  travis im a great guinea pig what 
none	 if i chop off my head  marisha it doesnt fix instant death  matt you still have to be alive for it to work although i will say i do love the idea of grog  normally proportioned with one tiny baby arm growing out  laughter  matt tiny hand  audience member first off thank you for what yall have done in letting us enjoy your show  thank you for playing and for letting us be a part of that  travis youre welcome  laura thank you  audience member i have a question moreso 
none	 on the aspect of if one of the characters were ever to go down  travis son of a bitch  audience member what you would bring in as your alternate character or in another campaign where  you cant come back bye travis  matt evil laughter  marisha its like survivor man  matt i like you what would you guys want to come back as if you have any idea  marisha its hard because we want it to be a surprise and also i think our idea changes from  day to day i know weve 
tavern	 all said theyd be the total opposites of whatever were playing now  travis id be a tavern wench  laughter  travis id sleep with everybody  laughter  travis sex is important  matt its a way to get experience just work your way to level four man  laura i would want magic i want to be able to play with magic a little more although i know  its so freaking complicated  matt its really not that complicated when you get into it the choices are broad yes and that  can be a little 
none	 intimidating but once you make those choices especially when you pick a class  that maybe has a little more limited scope with spell choices like the sorcerer or bard or  something like that its not that bad if youre a wizard then yeah youve got to be ready to  have that encyclopedia at your disposal  laura thats why they have the book right  matt yeah wizards have the book because they can be like all right what am i learning today  everyone else in the party goes ugh another round of bacon i guess 
none	  laura fried chicken is that percy  audience member it is  matt theres a percy thats awesome  audience member its my first attempt at a cosplay and i forgot my jacket at home  matt as long as you bring in the butt flap youre fine  audience member first of all hello from central pennsylvania the second thing is my little  sister would kill me this is a letter and gift for laura bailey  laura gasps should i come down there  travis sit down  laughter  audience member and finally my question 
none	 is for matt in the campaign that i run were using the  gunslinger that you made i know that you and taliesin worked together on a lot of his  inventions and gadgets that he makes whats the process you go through with him so that he can  create these amazing things like diplomacy and bad news and that kind of stuff but you keep it balanced  matt right what hell do is hell sketch up an idea whether it be an actual small drawing or  just the idea behind what he wants to create and 
none	 the effect that he wants and hell bring that to  me via email or personal discussion ill think about it and ill think in terms of what could be  balanced for his level and what kind of things he can do without it being a waytoogood ability for  his class beyond whats normally capable for the most part tinkering is about utility and helpful  things not to really strengthen the class the one exception was bad news and that was the one  thing that i worked with him that he spent his entire sixmonth time 
none	 jump working on where  everyone else was having side adventures and doing story stuff hes like i spent six months in my  workshop trying to make this i spent all my money on it and it still might fail on the rolls he  managed to succeed once he gets the concept ill go ahead and think out many times scaling it back  to what is balanced and ill write up what i think it should do then ill give him a series of costs  and checks he has to make for it if its more 
none	 of a giant powerful strengthbased tinkering  ability where he has to manipulate a lot of heavy metals itll be more of a strengthbased  tinkering check where you take the tinkering bonus and the strength modifier if its tinier more  intricate clockworkstyle its more of a dexteritybased tinkering check you change  whatever ability modifier applies to that roll based on the kind of task that it is the dc i  decide essentially based on how intricate and how good the final product is supposed to be and how  good his rolls are if its a 
none	 progressive series of rolls if he keeps failing rolls that final and  third dc check ill make pretty damn high so he still has a chance to succeed but it gets smaller  and smaller the more he fails the progressive attempts its relatively fluid its based  casetocase because honestly the tinkering rules are kind of vague but theyre intentionally  vague by the system so you can do what i do and create your own way of letting them occur i think  its a cool system 5th edition has done theyve given you the tools to 
none	 figure out in some cases  however you want to try and make it function which i like  audience member thank you so much  travis did you get all that  audience member iron trap  matt good good  travis i just heard mwa mwa mwa mwa  matt the point when travis just glazes over  laura tell your sister i said thank you she made this out of a quarter i know right  matt thats really cool  audience member hi maybe like a lot of people here thanks to critical role im cutting 
none	 my  teeth on dming im pretty longwinded as a person and i know that so it works for and  against me as the dm from your perspective do you ever experience when youre trying to explain  something and youre a couple of minutes into it youve got this awesome idea and youre trying to  explain it to your group and you find that maybe their eyes are glazing over its in my head im  trying to show it to you but maybe you feel like youre going too long how do you balance your  
none	 ive got to describe this scene and this area but what details are really pertinent  matt being concise its one of the things that comes with experience as well you may have an  extremely elaborate writeup for certain circumstances its also the presentation aspect  of it too ive gone into a few backstory diatribes with you guys exposition on certain  npcs because you would ask the right questions and you can still keep your attention as long as  you say it with conviction its the difference between going monotone and then the gods  created 
none	 the land and then there was the place that happened and the people went yay and  going forcefully and then the gods created the land and the people went yay as long as  youre engaged with the eye contact and confidence itll generally keep people engaged  more often a kind of oratory speech foundation half of its not even what you say its just how  you say it and being concise with the details when you finish writing up a description of a new  location go back through it again and be like how can 
none	 i eliminate a few of these sentences how  can i use different adjectives and by the way thesauruscom is your friend both to learn new  cool vocabulary words but as a way to truncate the ideas youre trying to get across  travis marisha and laura truncate  matt truncate truncates a word its a good word  audience member cool  matt take a moment to go through what youve put down and find ways to condense it a little  tighter and when you do say it to your party conviction  audience member cool thank 
none	 you  marisha i like that answer truncate go ahead  audience member my question requires a little bit of background i didnt start playing dd until  after college i always thought of it as some sort of competitive game where youre competing to get  levels and loot and then one man is making arbitrary decisions about who will succeed or not  matt and steven wins  audience member exactly it didnt make any sense to me recently when i took it as more group  storytelling it really clicked i went oh thats awesome i started 
none	 watching shows yours  of course and ive learned a lot of lessons ive tried to take everything i can any cool  ideas to try to bring into my own games the number one thing i take from your show believe it  or not is i love the way you guys cheer each other on its something i bring into my own games  that makes them so much better if youre constantly cheering for one another and ive  found that when i do it everybody has a much better time my question is do you have 
none	 anything  you do a mindset you bring in or tips and tricks you use to make sure the experience is fun for  everybody because that i think is the most important part and i think you do it so well that  thats why maybe your show is greater than a lot of peoples  marisha aw thanks man  travis i remember the very first time we ever played matt took me aside in some room because  was it laura and i were talking to that guy  laura oh yeah and you intimidated him right 
none	  travis he was like how do you want to intimidate him and i was like i dont what  was his question  laughter  travis i was like can i do anything and he was like you can certainly try  laughter  travis we were back in the bedroom in your apartment right we were waiting for the rest of  the table  matt it was the whole plan  travis yeah  laughter  travis i reached down and grabbed him by the throat and picked him up and he was going makes  choking 
none	 noises i was like wow this is great  laughter  travis i asked him later is there anything that you dont like about certain aspects of the game  hes like only when people play it safe dont play it safe safe can be so boring you know  its a fantasy world its your imagination there are all these things happening so dont play it  safe im like got it  laughter  laura i think it also helps that the whole party were all friends and we genuinely want to cheer  each other on and 
town	 encourage each other you know when grog has a fight with just one other person  we genuinely are interested and are watching it and supporting him and you know scanlan turning  into a rhinoceros we havent said anything for an hour but it was one of the best games i remember  playing because it was so much fun to watch him do all those crazy things  travis yeah we turned into the crowd  marisha its kind of interesting id never really thought about it before you were talking  about cheering each other on but 
dung	 its kind of like supporting your buddies at the gym come on  bro youve got this  matt a few more reps go go go  marisha come on dont quit so i think it does create maybe a different kind of support structure  matt as a dungeon master it helps to instill the idea that by the way guys if one of you does  poorly thats going to mess up all of you so you want this guy to succeed because it only helps  all of you its kind of your job as a dungeon 
none	 master to help sculpt a story that promotes unity  in the group as well its fun at certain times to instill tension in the group its likely to  happen naturally but because it happens naturally sometimes you have to try and  facilitate that idea of everyone working together as friends and supporting each other so try your  best and at least in the earlier parts of the campaign to not try and pit players against each  other because it can breed unfortunate emotions when theyre comfortable in their space been  playing for a while 
none	 and they all have built out the core thats when you can tweak it here and  there for those cool story moments but you still want to facilitate as the head storyteller that  laura as a master  matt as a master if you will to make sure that to succeed and continue friendship is the answer  laughter  travis there were moments of conflict that were fun though when percy tried to keep me from  getting the skull we were both smiling our asses off  audience member thats another thing even when you have 
none	 conflict i think a lot of times it  tears the fucking party apart you keep just being able to do it and still feel okay with it  travis yeah yeah yeah  audience member how do you all do that  marisha i think matt touched on this a little bit but keeping in mind that there is not a whole  lot of opportunities for group coop games so keep that in mind and really utilize it as a team  im trying not to make it sound awful i mean it whatever just have fun  
none	 laughter and applause  matt hello  audience member hi welcome to gencon or in lauras case welcome back  laura thank you thank you  audience member what do you guys think so far  matt its awesome ive only seen the exhibition hall peripherally but even glancing through im  like i should have brought another piece of luggage man after this hopefully i have this  threehour pack where ill be like and i apologize in advance if you see me wandering and  you approach me and im like no im fine its nothing against you 
none	 its just that i have  very short periods of time to actually enjoy the exhibition hall and i really literally just  wanted to buy everything  laughter  matt im going to go broke in there  audience member okay my actual question is what do you think  laughter  matt sorry what was that  audience member so what inspired you to create your individual characters and what drew you to  wanting to be a dm  matt what inspired you to make your individual characters  marisha what inspired us  matt yeah  
none	 marisha you go first  travis after one look at the players handbook and was like what the fuck is this  laughter  travis this is the most complicated and intimidating thing ive ever seen in my life like  cantrips and spell levels i was like matt what do i do just to hit things he said well you  could be a fighter or a monk or a barbarian im like barbarian good theyre usually dumb  hes like not necessarily then we rolled the character and i got an intelligence of six and i  was 
none	 like money  laughter  travis hes named grog duh  marisha is there any water in the house fabio  marisha and laura thats what were all saying  laura i wanted to be a rogue and i wanted to be a halfelf and then liam told me he was a rogue  already and i was really angry and then he said he was already a halfelf and i was also really  angry so i asked matt so the two things im thinking of being are a druid or a ranger which  one of these gets 
none	 to have an animal and he said both i was like shit what was i saying so  i said ill be a ranger and then i was like hey liam i still want to be a halfelf but we  actually have the same birthday in real life so maybe we could be twins in the game too and he  said yeah i like it so we did that  travis then you came up with those damn names  laura vex has been a name that i always go to whenever im playing any of my many 
none	 video games i  always like meanings i dont know why vex is one i already went to and so im going to be  vexahlia and hes like fine i want to be vaxildan as long as theres an apostrophe in  it were good  matt i think that was an early omen  marisha was it you or liam who was really adamant about the apostrophes  laura me  marisha okay i also had an apostrophe i came in last because i actually helped the first game  and then when it turned into a campaign 
none	 im like okay yeah if this could turn into a thing then  ill join so yeah i didnt play in that first game i was matts assistant  audience member matts familiar  marisha i basically just pointed at stats when they were confused its right there  laughter  marisha so many distractions i was also torn between a ranger and a druid and matt was like  well lauras already a ranger and i was like cool ill be a druid then  matt i think you tried druid in fourth edition and you hated it  
none	 marisha i hated it yeah i tried druid in fourth edition they were basically a watereddown  support class that wasnt they were trying to be a jackofalltrades but they just sucked at  everything i hated it so i was like all right ill give druids one last chance and then shes  my longtime character i was also like im going to play a nice person i never play nice  people its so hard to play nice people in rpgs but its a oneshot  laughter  matt i guarantee you that if keyleth goes away or 
dung	 the campaign finishes youre going to make a  character thats  marisha whos such a bitch awful selfish and evil im going to be on rumspringa man  laura youll get along with everybody im sure  matt to answer your question for me i was inspired to be a dungeon master from having a  really bad dungeon master my first six months of playing i loved the game i could see the  potential for it the potential for storytelling and the guy who was running was  just really really really hard to enjoy it wasnt 
none	 about the story more than it was lets go  kill things and also i have my own character whos in second edition a paladin but im also  going to want to take the samurai fighter kit because im the dm and im allowed to do that so  hes a samurai paladin dualwielding magical katanas and also hes got his griffon mount and  his holy sword and his holy quest was he woke up and this guy went here so yeah it was very  it was a pain in the ass and to walk away was 
dung	 like no go im going to run my own game so  then my whole inspiration i was driven to do it because i couldnt take bad examples of it and  then i was just fumbling in the dark for years going i guess this is how it works this is how  most of us did it when there wasnt examples of it you newer folk have such an easier time of it  you were creating a void in a vacuum wow i sound really old and crotchety now oh you youngsters  you dont know what 
none	 it was like we had to do reverse math for ac and thac0 well assume you  appreciate you skipped that area because i know that was pretty quick and thats basically my inspiration  audience member two more things one laura i share the same birthday  laura yeah  audience member and also a few weeks ago a tattoo appeared on twitter of critical role that  said how do you want to do this and then a question mark  matt oh no way that was you  laughter and applause  matt we were passing this 
none	 around earlier  laughter  laura whoa  marisha its all like new fresh ink  applause  marisha i love your shirt  marisha and laura im allura  audience member so my question is if your characters now could go back to their past selves  at the beginning of the campaign and give them one piece of advice sort of the same thing for  matt as a dm what advice would you give  marisha thats a good question  travis listen to the sword  laughter  laura dont let anybody else hold the carpet 
none	  laughter  travis shell never let that shit go  marisha so many things  laughter  audience member be nice to the elderly  travis be nice to the elderly  marisha stay away from children learn grasping vine placements thats what i would tell her practice  matt id like to tell gilmore to open shop further east dont stand there try stillben  thats a nice time of year id tell kima to maybe be more of a secondwave fighter let  everyone else go in first  laura like ever kima every time she gets 
none	 taken out  matt i know man shes got an awesome set of abilities im always excited to use and im like  well never mind one day  travis kima with the beholders right  matt kima and beholders is not a good setup man shes got a thing with eyes now its hate fear  anyone catches eye contact shes like good question thank you  laura hey presents what is that the story of  travis its cursed dont open it  laughter  travis trap check  laura these are so cute  matt theres sam 
none	 with his blue poo  laura look theres a beer behind you  matt i got sunglasses  laura i got gold thats awesome thank you  marisha oh man its all of us on our worst days  matt next question weve got a long line and not a lot of time  audience member i have a present for matt after my question so all of you did playlists for your  individual characters and all of them seem really good but im wondering just out of morbid  curiosity each of you say you had a professional 
none	 wrestlers entrance theme what would  it be  laughter  travis i thought of that i was in between acdcs thunderstruck and shipping up to  boston thats the first thing i thought of on that playlist you sir are a badass  laura maybe i dont know chants the best things in life are free i want money thats  what i want  marisha see i kind of had the version of strawberry fields on there where its like kind of  my thought on that thats like the slowmo soundtrack thats going on in kikis head 
none	 as shes  destroying things and stuff like singing take you down going to yeah but if you want  something more amped up maybe like singing its the eye of the tiger its the thrill of the fight  laughter  marisha yeah one easy bite  audience member matt do you have one for gilmore  laughter  travis singing im too sexy for my shirt  laughter  matt thats a good one thats a really good one but something with aretha franklin probably hell  yeah respect man it would be awesome if singing respect  
dung	 audience member i have something for matt because we share a love of dungeon mastering  dwarves and dice  music starts playing  matt sorry what was the question  audience member for dming dwarves and dice i wanted to give you my dungeon masters dwarven dice  matt are you sure man  audience member as sure as i can be  travis those are poison too  laura and travis wow  laura can we all i dont want to touch them im scared  travis theyre warm  matt very nice theyre actually metal thats awesome 
none	  laura roll a 20 next question  matt thats a 15 thats not bad  audience member inaudible  laughter  matt thats awesome  travis pretty good one  audience member but anyway thank you guys for being like my inaudible  matt wow  travis wait it wont shut up it keeps running through the whole show what  audience member inaudible  matt thats awesome  marisha are we speaking to you in our dream because im sorry if thats the case  audience member but anyway if you guys could play a different animal what 
none	 animal would you be  and also what would be your favorite animal to voice  marisha to what  audience member to voiceover  laura to voiceover  matt okay so what animal would your character be and what character do you want to voiceover  like an animal  travis id be a dire wolf  laura yeah  marisha totally i mean its tough because keyleth goes to minxie all the time thats her  favorite thats her comfy spot minxie but if not shed be i dont know she grew up playing  as kittens and 
dung	 squirrels in the forest true story which is why she was weird so i dont know  laura i think vex and vax would make really good raccoons  matt yeah actually  travis trash pandas  laura trash bin i dont want to be a trash bin  travis trash panda  laura oh trash panda  laughter  marisha somehow better  laura well all be connected though the red panda so its okay  matt as far as me as a dungeon master i would be an eagle but you know me as a person would  
none	 probably go mongoose or owl but not creepy barn owls with little beady eyes and the big round  face were talking great horned with an angry eyebrow thats the barn owl  laura oh i like that one  matt i like that one too but theyre like  travis oh my god  laughter  matt good question  audience member hi ive got a question thank you very much for bringing me back into dd after  a sevenyear hiatus im a local coordinator for dd adventurers league now including all new  games dming 32 hours 
none	 over the course of the con and i have to leave in 15 minutes will you please  accept this gift on behalf of everything youve done for it  travis yes  laughter  laura is it for all of us or just matt  audience member it is for some of you and im not trying to play favorites  laura theres not one for me in there there goes the whole box  audience member theres one in there for you laura there are two for keyleth there is one for  sam and there is one 
none	 for travis  travis thats sams oh shit that looks like me  laughter  laura did you paint them yourself  audience member i painted those myself yes  laura oh my gosh thank you so much  audience member youre welcome laura the bigger they are the easier they are to hit that was my  shirt cosmic dd i love you guys  laura thank you so much  applause  matt thank you for continuing to bring the stories that you create for other people thats  fantastic seriously  laura this is a really good 
none	 vex  travis weve got ten minutes weve got to do this fast  audience member ill try to make this quick then ive been playing tabletop games for several  years and because of critical role and titansgrave ive been inspired to set up my first  campaign this month im a very shy and introverted person so do you have any tips for  building confidence getting the nerve to get it started  laura shot of tequila  laughter  travis wed be drinking for that first game we played  marisha you mean for shy introverted 
none	 players  audience for the dm  laura for yourself  marisha shot of tequila  matt something to take the edge off definitely doesnt hurt  travis kill all your players  laughter  audience member if theyre all dead you cant be embarrassed  matt its always going to be nervewracking that first game to an extent its still  nervewracking today still get those little butterflies in your stomach you just learn  through experience to harness that going forward what helps is to know that all the players are  there to support you especially if 
none	 you create the right group of people that are in the right  mindset theyre all excited for the prospect of living in the space that you create for them be  confident in the knowledge that they want to have the same good time that you want them to have as well  music helps soundtracks are great not just for mood and setting but it also makes you feel like  the silence isnt being driven by you if its just you talking and then nothing that for some  reason is more intimidating for me as a 
dung	 storyteller having some soundtracks or music in  the background already helps bolster your mood as you start weaving that little tale and listen  listen as a dungeon master because even though the pressure is on you in theory to run the  game a lot of your job is reactionary and listening to what the players do and say and act  as and bringing the recourse of the world reacting to that experience when i say its  collaborative storytelling it really is collaborative yeah youre the dungeon master  but all of you are creating together 
none	 so as long as you go in the mindset that theyre putting as  much into this as you are though you may have most of the preparation and you listen to what  theyre doing youll find yourself a little more confident in that knowledge as you go forward  i hope some of that helps there are many things you can try im sure there are other communities  out there that can give even more elaborate responses but off the top of my head those are  some things  travis good question  matt no worries 
none	 good luck  applause  audience member hey im chris  laura hey whats up  audience member so when they talked about the wrestler theme song i merely thought of vaxs as  singing hello darkness my old friend  laughter  audience member my question is what is the most satisfying moment each of your characters have had  ingame  laura most satisfying  matt most satisfying moment for each of your characters  marisha kicking a beholder in the face was pretty awesome as an earth elemental also rocketing  from the sky as an earth 
none	 elemental meteor was pretty awesome also cannonballing as an earth elemental  laughter  marisha mainly when im an earth elemental its dope  laughter  travis i loved not dying at kevdaks hand and getting scooped up into the necklace not  pokeball and getting airdropped out i had like four hit points i was like fuck it im going  to die lets go out in a blaze of glory and a natural 20 happened it was skin of my ass  matt i still cant believe that  travis i know  matt i was watching that 
none	 battle unfold going oh  travis i watched it afterwards and i almost tore my shirt open  laughter  marisha how many pencils have you broken now three yeah  matt laura  laura i dont know i dont know  travis its just a satisfying moment its not a test  laura i mean scooping you up in the necklace was pretty cool like flying out and doing that  travis that was pretty dope  audience member becoming royalty  laura yeah that was pretty cool  audience member talking to trinket  laura and i guess 
none	 you guys are all caught up on the show right i can say that out loud  laughter  laura to be fair that was pretty awesome that wasnt my doing though but it was still pretty sexy  matt i dont want to spoil too much just in case people are behind but there is a location in the  world that i spent a lot of time fleshing out and designing with a lot of characters and structure  and then in one fell swoop just tearing it down very weirdly cathartic its like spending hours  building 
none	 a sand castle then just jumping on it its weirdly human i made this hah  audience member like playing jenga  audience member my question is actually about larping have you guys ever done it would you  ever want to do it for the new intro you dressed up as all your characters and had a lot of fun  doing that  travis it was cold as shit  matt ive larped a little bit in vampire the masquerade i didnt come in with a great  experience unfortunately because i came into a very wellrun longrunning 
none	 group of like 40  people in simi valley and la i got thrown into the middle of a direct political struggle as a  very important political figure with no idea about how any of the political structure works everyone  turned to me and was like you are the princes new friend tell me how the and i was like i  dont know whats going on sure that guy it was a little stressful as far as fantasy larping  i havent done it yet i know one of these days i will im scared to do 
none	 it because i know ill  enjoy it far too much and i have so little free time as it is its going to be one of those  things where im like what else can i give up to make this happen sure i dont need to eat but  i will probably get too into it if i did  audience member come do madness with cthulhu  marisha i was going to say the three of us have kind of casually larped for the call of cthulhu  party that matt had  laura thats true we 
none	 did  matt thats true yeah i tricked you guys into larping  marisha yeah  laughter  laura that was my first experience with anything like that  travis it was awesome  matt i ran a 1920sstyle cthulhubased birthday party and wrote everyone character stories and  they all came in costume and once everyone arrived incharacter spent the next four hours  solving puzzles and wandering the house discovering ways to get the story  laura and it all went to shit because everybody started hoarding all the secrets for themselves  matt yeah it turned into 
none	 a mexican standoff yuri pulled out his tommy gun prop that he brought  in a  marisha that was what was crazy we were like everyone was pulling out their weapons  laura he was a gangster wasnt he  matt yeah he was a secret enforcer who showed up with a giant violin case and was like im the musician  laughter  matt then he pulled out a tommy gun and it was between him and leo they all started pulling guns  on each other and it was a giant standoff  marisha we were like 
none	 where did these come from we did not bring these or provide these it was a  perfect allegory like it could have been a social experiment for how the worlds going to end i  swear to god it went very poorly very fast  matt the answer is devoured by the argument  marisha yes  laura the questions are the main thing  matt you guys did awesome good question  audience member hello first for travis go cowboys  travis yeah cowboys  audience member and ive got a question for most of you or all 
none	 of you but its mostly towards  matt but first i have to ask do you guys like disney movies animated movies and pixar movies  all yes  audience member which disneyanimated character besides maleficent would you pick to be the best  one to fight in a dd campaign  marisha besides maleficent  laura ooh ursula  marisha you know i think cruella de vil would be an interesting kind of not necessarily  damagedealing but you have to kind of intrigue around it cruella de vil as a boss would be cool  travis i would 
none	 fistfight gaston  cheering  matt so you start with cruella de vil which leads into a confrontation with gaston which then  goes to the ultravillain ursula who you think is the main villain until you defeat her and the  mountain explodes and chernobog arises  laughter  laura hello  audience member i just want to say thank you guys youre awesome  matt youre awesome  audience member i met you last night too  matt i know thats how i know youre awesome  laughter  audience member i have a voice actor question about 
none	 a year ago i was playing elder scrolls  online and i met a tree that sounds like grog does it happen to you guys a lot like youre  playing a game and you hear oh i know that guy  travis grog voice yes  laughter  laura yeah pretty much theres no game you can play now that youre not like oh hey matt hey again  marisha shut up troy thats my favorite is being like oh shut up grog and screaming  laura but what is surprising when you know somebody like i know matt 
none	 or something and then  i find out he was the voice and i had no idea thats always really fun to know somebody so well  and they can still surprise you with these voices they have oh are we out of time  moderator yeah this ones going to be the last one  travis last one sorry guys  matt i know its okay  laura i know im sorry  audience member its funny because that has something to do with my question how tomorrow is  or other times you play dd live on stage 
dung	 how do you deal with nervousness me i get hiccups or  burps like you guys did at the first live show  laura oh i get burps all the time  audience member how do you guys deal with nerves without the alcohol  laughter  laura how do you deal with the nerves without alcohol  matt because i dont drink at the games because im not allowed to im the dungeon master for me  marisha point of order we didnt do that you chose that  laughter  matt a lot of it stems from a 
none	 theatre background and theres something about just being on stage  that the nerves are there you learn to harness that energy in a way they never really go away  i think youll all agree even getting up for all of us have been doing stage for years and  years and years and you at e3 going on to talk about gears like how nervous was that  laura oh i was so nervous so many people  matt it never goes away and so the best thing you can do is do your best to harness that 
none	 energy  and turn it into excitement theres no real trick to it besides for some people alcohol i guess  but just learning  laughter  matt learning to know youre there for a reason and that people are there to support you and not  tear you down and theres something exciting about that  laura and usually once you get through that initial moment youll have the nerves like  whenever i would do musicals my voice would crack in my very first song because i was so nervous  that i couldnt contain it that i 
none	 would always crack and then after that crack was done i knew  the rest of the show was going to be the bomb because ive gotten it out of my system and i was  fine so you just lay into it get it out of the way and then everything else will be fine after that  marisha what they said  applause  laura the box office is still open for the live show if anybody hasnt got tickets those are  still available you can still come and see us tomorrow night and  travis whats 
none	 the name of the theater called its the  moderator murat theater walking distance  travis walking distance  matt wizards of the coast gave us a bunch of packages of gifts that were going to give out to  people at the live show  cheering  travis ashley will be there  laura yeah ashley will be there  cheering  matt yeah and for those of you with your questions i do have a panel at 300 this  afternoon video game voiceover youre welcome to come and bring any left over critical role  questions as
