/none/ to know that we can carve some  good out of it here tonight  cheering  matt and in that regard so we dont keep you too long before we can get to the game which you all  came here to watch lets go through some quick announcements very quick in fact i think the  big announcement if liam and taliesin want to take that  liam sure so taliesin and i have been working on something for about a year with around 89 artists  from our community its been a glimmer in our eye for /none/ over a year and it is almost here were  going to be releasing in the fall from the geek  sundry store a critical role art book  cheering  sam liam theyre excited about reading they love books  taliesin weve only told them about the pictures so far  liam you guys know what a crucial part of this community the artists have become and we have  selected 89 artists from many more there wasnt enough pages are limited do i have a page  number on here  taliesin 260 something pages  brian 256 /none/ liam  taliesin 256 pages  liam weve seen it and it is beautiful theres going to be a deluxe edition and a standard  edition it will be available for sale in the geek  sundry store in the late fall published by  hunters books  taliesin ill say regardless of what version when you actually get the book its going to be  treated as an artifact from the cobalt reserve so theres going to be historical texts and writings  from various librarians in the cobalt reserve chronicling the adventures of vox machina  including a /none/ lot of fun easter eggs and there will be some fun easter eggs in there there may even  be some background meta data that doesnt really exist anywhere else  liam yeah this is not your basic go the cvs store and get a photo book made a lot of love and  care went into this weve been talking with artists for months and months a lot of blood  sweat and tears have gone into this were very grateful to the artists who are involved some of  them are in this audience tonight thank you  /none/ cheering  liam we stood around and looked at a proof of this about a week ago and i might have gotten a  little verklempt it is really special so keep your eyes open for it oh yeah one last thing to  keep up to date im sure well talk more about it but you can visit geekandsundrycomartbook to  sign up for email updates and book previews so do so  taliesin it should be available for ordering sometime in the late fall  all late fall  matt thank you guys very much  laura yeah /none/ thank you guys  matt these two busted their ass on this book  cheering  matt the other quick announcement we have its a fun little thing thatll be tomorrow for those of  us at gencon and if it goes over well hopefully at other events in future but when we released  the taldorei campaign guide the original design of the cover was from a pov of scanlan and there  was some dissent in the community that scanlan wasnt in full display on the cover so i  contacted aaron riley the fantastic artist that worked /none/ on our cover and we got some vinyl decals  made so you can put one of two different pictures of scanlan on your cover of the book or any book  or art piece you find  cheering  matt were hoping to have those in tomorrow for those who can come to the signing and even if you  didnt get a ticket for the signing come to the event anyway we will have those available to pass  out hopefully so you can pick from the two or grab one of each its going to be ridiculous /none/ one  of the particular images im excited to see where scanlan shows up  laura theyre really great  matt its absurd  liam whys this small man on the sistine chapel  laughter  matt thats why theyre vinyl you can remove them without damaging property i think well  find out anyway without further ado i think that brings us to the end of our announcements for  the evening and as such bring us into tonights episode of critical role  dramatic music  travis lets go  matt all right lets bring this down  /none/ marisha holy shit  liam vecnas amish taint  laughter  matt a little late but thank you i appreciate that last we left off vox machina in their trek  to eventually hopefully seal and be rid of the threat of vecna the whispered one in his  recently ascended godhood on the prime material plane found themselves traversing below the  subocean volcano the scaldseat where they managed to waterbreathe their way through a jug  they traversed the poisonous air within and coming upon the allhammers core anvil on which  many artifacts of the founding and /none/ beyond were forged there you fought with the forge guardian  who was left to see who has proven worthy to utilize its components you defeated it and in  doing so percival with the designs bestowed upon you from ioun and grog with the bestowedupon  knowledge of blacksmithing took to the blacksmith tools and together managed to forge barely  successfully with a modicum of structural integrity the three prime trammels hopefully  intended to destroy or at least seal off vecnas influence on this plane  the trammels now complete each glowing with the runes of each /none/ gifted deity power source we have  one that glows yellow across its runic outside one that is a sky blue and one that emanates a  black shadow from its runes representing each deity that bequeathed an element of their power  unto these trammels you then decided to have scanlan drop his magnificent mansion and decide  where your next journey was as you all enter the mansion preparing for an evenings rest or  otherwise we left off with you now away from the heat of the volcano plotting your next  directional path  so vox /none/ machina what do you want to do  liam thats a great question  laura let me see those trammels who has the trammels  travis i do why  laura i just want to look at them  travis all of them or just one  laura all of them  travis fucking hell shit here you go  laura thats it i just want to hold them really  travis theyre real big right  laura yeah im cradling them grog  matt surprisingly though due to the platinums design theyre not as heavy as you expect them /none/  whether itd be the enchantment or the material that it was made from theyre still heavy for  you vex because your strength is pretty shitty  laura can i tell which one is which god  matt yes the one that glows yellow you feel a slight bit of kinship with the blessing you  received from pelor the dawnfather the other two you can differentiate being the sky blue  color probably with ioun the knowing mistress and the black probably representing the raven  queen  laura all right cool im going to hold on to /none/ the pelor one pass them back  travis ive got the other two  laura yeah i dont know if anybody else wants to hold one  travis just in case things go sour i also thought of a nice way to use these and i slide one between  each of my fingers and i hold it up shink okay back in the bag of holding  liam are you still embiggened right now  travis no i havent been biggened for a while  laura yeah he was only big fighting the bulette  travis oh wait by /none/ the way i believe you said that if i successfully did all of these trammels  that you had something for me thought i wouldnt remember did you  laughter  liam i did say that its rather personal though i hope the rest of you can understand  that im not going to be around for much longer so i wanted to say  sam do you want us to step out so you can have a moment  liam no well find a minute  sam what what does that mean  liam its awkward its not something /none/ im comfortable talking with  laura so you want us to leave  liam no we can talk out a plan tonight before we go to bed it could be now it could be later  marisha youve said too much about it now  liam i take grog by the arm and i usher him out the door of the mansion  travis this is weird  laura outside the mansion youre out the mansion now  liamyeah  sam youre going outside  liam just out the front door  sam into the inside of the volcano  /none/ liam is it on fire  matt its certainly very hot  liam fuck it grog lets go downstairs  travis war room  marisha he has 40 floors  travis were going down to the war room which is a sand pit  liam yeah and i ignore all of the catcalling and all of the sniping and all of the shittiness  these fucking assholes  laura have fun you two  sam use protection  laughter  liam thats what grog is for  matt the two of you descend the staircase into the subterranean war room /none/ where there you see  before you the giant sand pit that is currently adorned with multiple training dummies with armor  and weapons strapped to them magnificently pristine based on how many times you destroyed  andor restructured the chamber but there it lies before you  liam big man  travis yeah thats me  liam im not going to be around much longer probably or youre not going to be around much  longer one or the other  travis yeah  liam yeah boy ive been holding on to a thing for a while now taryon /none/ that scamp gave me a  gift ages ago he became a fan after i pranked his ass at the beach he caught the bug and before we  said our goodbyes he talked to me for a bit and gave me something  travis you pranked his ass and he caught the bug  laughter  liam right ive got to talk simpler sorry thats my mistake taryon gave me a very unique  item and the purpose of it was to fuck with you  cheering  liam i could say turducken and you people would turn it /none/ into sexual innuendo  cheering  travis i dont know what that is  liam anyway he wanted me to pull a prank on you and we have a lot of history with that and i held  onto it for a long time looking for a time that felt right and it never happened and sometimes i  felt like i didnt want to do that anymore but i dont want to let his gift go to waste and truth  be told i did a bit of research on it it is a love potion grog  gasping /none/ and cheering  matt i forgot about that liam lasts about an hour  laughter  liam lasts about an hour and for a while it was really tempting and i was looking for a moment  because thats you and me thats history but then i did some research and it turns out that it  wouldnt have worked on you anyway because if you want someone to fall in love with you it has  to be on a person who youd be interested in and to quote a very handsome dickhead we know im  pretty sure /none/ you go taco not hot dog  laughter  liam so i was right to assume then yeah  travis yep taco  liam were not all so limited but thats your thing thats fine i cant even use it on you  but ive got it and im going to miss you ill be gone soon i dont even know if we have time a  lot of us could be dead soon but im not offering you this thing but im offering you an  experience  cheering  travis i dont know a lot of big words /none/ but i feel like i need a little bit of clarification  liam i dont know if we have time for this but maybe for old times sake because i love you and  i know you love me and we share this in common i thought maybe we could prank scanlan together  cheering  liam because lets be honest that guy would fuck a turducken in front of him  travis just for the record i had no doubts about where that conversation was going none you have  a deal i dont know how or when we /none/ are going to pull this off but if you dont make time  liam yeah it could be tonight  travis fuck it its tonight  laughter  liam heres what i dont have i dont have a plan  travis nope me neither we never have those so listen maybe while were eating some of those  shitty salads that this fucking place makes now you can drizzle it on the top or does he have to  drink it with a drink  liam i think he just needs to down it one way or another it could /none/ be mixed with something else it  could be on its own  travis who do we make him fall in love with  liam well originally i was thinking maybe we could have a bet and see which one of us he falls  in love with  laughter  liam and i know thats a shitty idea but we have to get up and  travis i fucking love it  laughter and cheering  liam so that means isolating the gnome away from the others because he could fall in love with  literally anything or anyone /none/  travis yeah but look the hunter does not go after its prey in an isolated environment the  hunter finds him in his natural habitat let him roam free i say  laughter  liam im not sure i know what that means but i will carry this baton and follow your lead  travis well look before the rest of the group starts wondering what were doing in the war room  lets go back up and whenever your sneaky ass thinks its appropriate you drip in his drink  how about that  liam well call that /none/ plan a plan b will be that you grab his ass and i just shove it in  laughter  liam plan a plan b you know those letters you know that far  travis i do i know that part and we head back to the group  sam meanwhile inside im just so happy to be back in the group  laughter  sam its been a pretty crazy few days but i feel like youve all accepted me and im so happy to be  back and i cant thank you enough really from the bottom of /none/ my heart thank you thank you for  fully accepting me back  laura were really sorry for everything scanlan you know we love you  sam i love you too not in a weird way  laura no im married  sam just friends  laura that would be awkward  liam hey what are you guys talking about  sam oh just how much we love life  marisha how were a happy family you know  liam we are we are close  travis yells who wants a drink  laughter  sam thats a great idea /none/ grog invisible servants bring us the finest vegan wine  matt as a procession of ghostly entities make their way from the faroff kitchen on the basement  floor of scanlans magnificent mansion they procure a number of glass bottles containing wine  its just wine  sam but no added animal fats  matt youre not wrong goblets are placed across the tables drinks are poured and you all have  within your grasp a fair nightcap if you will before you find rest for the evening  travis clears throat scanlan man great teamwork today everyone really  /none/ laura yeah seriously im so amazed with both you and percy you really pulled through and we  would be lost without both of you  liam i start examining my fingernails and moving closer to scanlan  laughter  marisha i do feel like our teamwork has been getting better though weve been doing so good  synergizing  laura yeah that fight couldve gone terribly and we pulled through as a team  marisha oh a hundred percent  sam you know what though i know in the past vax ive had my differences with you i didnt /none/  like you charging after that dragon that one time and we had some issues but tonight i feel like  were close and you would never do anything to betray me  liam oh that wine looks really good  sam lets take a sip but first i was thinking about how close weve become vax and i even  wrote you a little inspirational song  cheering  liam here let me hold your drink  sam okay sure youll hold my drink while i sing this is just a song to show you how much you mean /none/  to me and how close weve become over these years its a long one rapping dont be tired im  here to inspire before you blow out let me light your fire i got no choir just a gnome and a  lyre so listen up to burt reynolds esquire  rhythmic clapping  sam oh thats going to fuck me up rapping youve got those moves like dagger youre fast as  a cat you can attack five times i checked it with matt you cant be killed and one more  caveat you get to sit next /dung/ to the poohbah de doink of all this and that  so imagine a dark room lit from above folks as far as czech republic came to give you their love  your heart is beating like a goddamn drum its singing im going back to indiana indiana here  i come the tension is building the roofs going to blow this aint a rehearsal its the  motherfucking live show mics rolling cameras on dice rolling scanlans song no more  cajoling this shit is on this crowd is bigger than my cubelike dong  cheering  sam you /none/ been down but whats it going to take to give you some sack man how about 2400 critters  chanting vaxildan vaxildan vaxildan  chanting  matt go ahead and make a sleight of hand check  liam 29 that was inspiration to me  marisha hes inspiring you because he thinks youre going to fucking fail  liam 39  matt scanlan why dont you go ahead and make a perception check  sam thats a 12  liam i instantly dive and grab keyleths eyes and cover them and turn her away  marisha stop get off of /none/ me  liam sorry  marisha why your hands are a little clammy oh god why are you sweating why are you nervous  youre nervous  matt a very strange display from vaxildan however your drink is available for you at the  table  sam yeah  laura that was a great song scanlan  sam thats good stuff man i just feel invigorated  matt all right so as you finish the drink you blink your eyes im going to ask you scanlan  who do you see first  sam lets see here what do we /none/ got six people over here  matt well you have two that have dove off to the side  sam oh okay then ill roll a d4 one two oh wait its just three it was a fucking four two  okay keyleth  matt no keyleth is being shielded right now  sam oh shit well then its just vex or percy or wait are those two too  matt the other people in the room right now are percival vex or grog  sam okay well then it would be grog do i have three choices or four /none/  laura you have four choices  sam four choices all right and could you raise your hand if youre one of my choices okay one  two three four  its percy  cheering  matt so heres my question scanlan first and foremost let me pull up is there a saving throw  liam philter of love  matt right  liam i can recite it for you if you like the next time you see a creature within ten minutes  after drinking this philter you become charmed by the creature for one hour if the creature /none/ is of a  species and gender you are normally attracted to turducken you regard it as your true love while  you are charmed this potions rosehued effervescent liquid contains one easytomiss  bubble shaped like a heart  matt how long does it last  liam one hour  matt all right and i guess my question to you scanlan is based on your journeys and travels  across the lands of taldorei and beyond how adventurous have you been in your various  exploits  sam a human man that was teenage years baby ive gone much /none/ further than that since then  matt then as you glance up into the beautiful eyes of the whitehaired master of whitestone his  white locks gently curling at the tips from an afternoon of sweating amongst the heat of the  volcano his fingers gingerly caressing the outside of the goblet in which hes enjoyed his  own wine you find yourself impossibly attracted to your once ally now direction of your  affection  sam i dont know i dont know if its the wine talking but oh man i feel something ive never  felt before percival /none/  taliesin that sounds like the wine talking  sam ive never seen you in this light before your eyebrows i want to lick them they seem soft  laura you want to what  sam that came out wrong what i meant was what are you doing later  laura i walk up and i palm scanlans forehead and slam him to the ground what the fuck are you  doing  sam im sorry its just well youve seen it  laughter  matt continue  sam the way he looks at you and everything stops the way /none/ all sound fades away when hes talking  marisha no thats his silence spell that he got recently  sam the way he cocks his gun groans holds it so firmly it trembles just a little but then  bang moans just a gentle touch is all it takes  taliesin would this be an insight check at this point  matt yes  travis please  taliesin oh no  travis no its not is it really  laura im going to feel his forehead does he feel warm  taliesin how long have you felt this way this /none/ is a bit  sam it feels like forever singing one song glory one song to win your heart glory where do  i even start  taliesin i dont know whats happening right now  sam singing one song from the pretty boy gnome  travis we fucked up oh man  laura scanlan i dont blame you i dont this seems to be coming out of nowhere and hes  married to me and i will cut you  sam love knoweth no boundaries and even though theres a significant age difference between us  laura how much /none/ of an age difference  sam im not at liberty to say  laughter  sam why does marriage need to be so constricting man i mean cant we be free in this crazy  mixedup world  taliesin im not going to pretend that im not extremely flattered by this and i am but i dont know  sam i want to see you naked  marisha scanlan are you experiencing a bit of cotton mouth maybe  sam smacking yes  marisha are your pupils a little dilated  sam the lights  laura im going to look /none/ into his eyes are his eyes dilated  marisha i turn to vax what did you do  taliesin is it that hard to believe that maybe someone finds me attractive  cheering  liam guys this is all besides the point we have a god to kill what are we going to do about the god  sam yes no we should talk we should strategize  laughter and cheering  liam i want to step outside the game for a second to say that sam riegel gave me a bullet to kill  travis willingham with and i /none/ have turned the gun back on sam riegel  cheering  liam and shortly it will be my time to die  matt after this unique and unexpected display of overt affection you find yourself sitting around  a table amongst the mansion to discuss over your wine and confusion what plan of action to take  next in your journey to take down the whispered one the undying king  laura im going to sit directly between percy and scanlan for all of this conversation  travis so we rest and then we go hunting or do we try /none/ and rally allies  sam i cast mage hand to tickle percys knee  laura i have a 23 passive perception scanlan  matt scanlan make a sleight of hand check  sam 20  laura what  matt yeah you see him starting to make his fingers over towards your boy  laura i grab his fingers and start to bend them backwards i whisper in his ear do you want to  keep playing your fucking lute or not  sam id prefer it if percy did  laughter  laura seriously what the fuck is wrong with /none/ you how long have you felt this way because this is  very fucking strange scanlan  sam i dont know it was love at first sight but now so not first im sorry im sorry ill try  to keep it together ill think of gross things victors ball sack ugh  matt learn from my mistakes  sam why are they so singed all right okay lets focus up okay go on strategize  liam time we dont have a lot of time so what are we going to do with it are we going to get  /none/ allies are we going to talk to allura again gilmore  travis ooh wait first things first do we know where he is dont you have the ability to like  laura oh yeah is he still in the same place  liam i dont know in here i need to shove my head out the door for a sec  laura well shove your head out the door  matt all right as you emerge into the heated air of the subocean volcano you take a moment and  concentrate and you can sense the direction and distance seems /none/ to be approximately the same  laura he hasnt moved at all  matt make a perception check i guess  liam 24  matt 24 you take about five minutes or so to concentrate and while the distance and direction  is relatively the same there is very faint movement  liam am i able to feel gradual coming towards where we are away anything like that  matt from where you are currently which is in the volcano it seems to be east and south of its  previous location  laura where would that move him towards /none/  marisha towards vasselheim  laura solid  taliesin we should maybe go to vasselheim in the morning start to rally  laura yeah do allura and gilmore and kima and everyone do they know whats going on have we  sent word  taliesin well weve sent some word out to the world  liam weve sent messages to tary and to who else there were two messages sent  marisha tary the ashari  sam kaylie i think  taliesin we activated the beacons  marisha we activated the chaos orbs crisis orbs i always mess them up /none/  travis so we should rest and head to vasselheim  taliesin were not any good to anybody at the moment so i imagine so  liam i think well all feel better after a nights sleep yeah  travis scanlan where are you sleeping tonight  sam in my room  travis do we need to post guards outside  sam i have all the guards i need dont worry ill be safe  marisha were not worried about you  taliesin itll be fine  laura itll be fine  travis laughs itll be great  sam so /none/ were going to sleep and then to vasselheim  travis we rest and then we go  taliesin thats the plan  laura yeah  sam okay lets do it  matt all right finishing your wine you all scatter to your various rooms throughout the  mansion prepare yourselves for an evenings rest in the morning journey to the cradle of  civilization vasselheim  taliesin i do set a bucket trap at the door just in case i set a bucket trap  liam as everybodys trundling up the stairs i catch grog alone for a second and /none/ say let this  stand as a testament to how much i love you im sorry that i shaved your beard  travis thank you i dont have to kill you now  applause  liam give him a little pinch on the cheek oh grog you couldnt if you tried now good night  big guy  travis night  matt all right you all find yourselves in your chambers anything else you wish to do before the  evening comes to a close  sam yes sorry matt i know were trying to get to other things but /tavern/ magic compels me to put on my  best silk gstring and it compels me to use the series of tunnels that interconnect all of the rooms  taliesin oh shit no  sam that only i know about and it compels me to sneak into percivals room in the dead of night  and crawl into bed with him  laura im in the bed you motherfucker  sam are you in there  laura were married  sam i thought it was like the 50s where you had two twin beds  matt have you seen their gold /none/ pile  sam then i guess i better be extra stealthy  matt make a stealth check  sam okay i think thats going to work eight  laughter  matt with a slight jostle vexahlia and percival you both pop one eye open and glance  over as what you thought at first might be a small child crawling into your bed scared of a midnight  storm instead find a magnificent silkadorned familiar gnome trying to wedge himself between  your bodies which is impressive based on the spooning position youre already in  sam let it happen /none/  taliesin i reach underneath my pillow i grab a small copper ball manners  cheering  matt all right and thats a strength ability check  taliesin thats a strength check i believe  sam just a check  matt is it a check or saving throw thats the distinction now  taliesin where is it its a check not a saving throw  sam ten  taliesin no  matt with a rapid series of clicks whirrs and grinding of metal you watch as a metallic  exoskeleton unwinds from the sphere clicking wraps itself around your body /none/ you find yourself  suddenly bound and held in place unable to shift as these cold metal bars wrap around you like an  exoskeleton  laura scanlan shorthalt tell me now why i shouldnt feed you to trinket  taliesin i undo the lock so he can talk  sam im sorry i dont know whats happening to me i know that this is your marital bed can i at  least watch i promise i wont look at you vex i wont look at you at all ill just be looking at  percy  laura would we /none/ know that something is wrong  taliesin i rolled a one i dont know anythings wrong  matt make an insight check on this  laura what am i making insight okay  matt now that youre up close and definitely discerning his behavior  laura fucking a  taliesin i rolled a one  laura its a 12 but i rolled a three  matt you get the sense that somethings off and different but you think it may be a practical  joke or hes just trying to fuck with you  laura all i have is lesser /none/ restoration unless youre fucking with me im going to try lesser  restoration  taliesin or we could go to his room and defile his room god only knows whats happened there  laura heres the thing darling if something is wrong with him and this is so out of character  im afraid something is wrong with him not that youre not completely desirable  taliesin thats all i needed to hear go on  laura but he needs a good nights sleep and im afraid he wont get it in this  taliesin all right  laura im /none/ going to try lesser restoration on him im not sure if itll work  taliesin in case this is magical i just want to leave you with something  laughter  laura in case its not dont do that anymore  matt all right you extend your hand you complete the incantation under your breath and  begrudgingly administer a lesser restoration spell onto his body you watch as his gnomish form  suddenly flashes with a brief burst of divine energy and as it subsides his eyes blink and  stare back to percival with the same longing lust /none/ that he had when he entered the room  laura well fuck i got nothing scanlan seriously this is not acceptable go to bed if  we let you out of this cage will you go to bed  sam muffled agreement  laura im going to send trinket to your room with you and hes going to sleep on top of you so that  you will go to sleep  sam muffled agreement  laura yeah lets do that  taliesin manners click  matt all right it unlatches itself and reforms into the iron ball that you /none/ carry at your side  scanlan as you fall the ground clasping the floor with your hands and knees breathing heavily  still the warmth subsiding from the slight touch that you received at percivals fingertips based  on the time you spent drinking conversing scattering to your rooms getting dressed and  making sure you were properly prepared for this endeavor making your way through the tunnels  stealthing in at this moment its right about now that the phial wears off  sam ha ha just a birthday prank is it your birthday  laura and taliesin no /none/  sam oh got the date wrong retching i need to change i have jizzed in my pants  laughter  sam im sorry  taliesin too much information thank you  sam have a good evening  taliesin good evening do you walk out the main door  sam the main door  taliesin okay so you do in fact trigger a bucket  laughter  taliesin with a viscous powder that i mixed up its basically a flour base its going to be a  real pain to wash off  matt youre a ghostwhite bucketheaded gnome in /none/ a silk gstring  laura why why did you do it  sam for the lulz  laughter  sam i dont know ill see you in the morning  taliesin im going to block the secret passage im going to shift some furniture  liam by the way when everyone asks me tomorrow on social media why i did it same answer  taliesin this was good well done you  matt after some disconcerting conversation between the married couple and a shameful walk  back to your own chambers you eventually find yourself coming to rest for the /none/ evening after a  full nights sleep you find yourself with your spells restored your hit points restored half  your hit dice restored and an embarrassing morning breakfast before you as you all come down  to a fine vegan breakfast meal there on the table you all have conversation start plotting and  planning and you hear the gentle footsteps of one slowly approaching scanlan to the breakfast  table  laura oh hey  sam husky hey clears throat didnt sleep a lot sorry hey percy  taliesin hi  marisha what distributor do you get your /none/ wine from just curious  sam i dont want to talk about it  laura so vasselheim  taliesin yep  matt all right so finishing your meals what do you guys want to do youre going to vasselheim  how are you doing that  marisha okay do we have a plan before we get there before i teleport us into the middle of a  city that might possibly be in the middle of a war zone  liam why dont i go see how much progress hes made and i stick my skull out the door again /dung/ and  see how far hes gotten  matt okay make a perception check  liam very good 30  matt okay listening to your senses and focusing on the direction still traveling still  relatively slow pace as far as the general distance but its making headway its traveled  throughout the night a number of miles  taliesin we should at least prepare vasselheim then  travis yeah he hasnt obviously gotten there right  taliesin if a wrath of a dark god is on its way they should probably prepare themselves  marisha also im assuming hes /none/ traveling with an army  taliesin we would assume with one eye each  laura oh god what if vasselheim is a show of power  taliesin that would be likely  sam lets hurry  travis where to in vasselheim  marisha how long would it take us to get out oh wait we chartered that boat do we care about  those people  taliesin wow  marisha or are we just going to leave them in the middle of the ocean  laura they were only going to wait for us a couple of days and then /none/ they were going to head back  liam yeah they would assume we drowned  marisha okay fair argument  matt yeah you gather that probably when they drove a bunch of yahoos out in the middle of the  ocean to dive under a volcano in the ocean that they did not expect you to return  marisha we did put a 500 gold holding deposit on an incidental that we will not get back  laura i think the destruction of the world may be more important than 500 gold  shocked noises  laura i know  /none/ sam quick cast lesser restoration on yourself  marisha it would probably take us a while to get up and out to a tree right im being a little  selfish with my upperlevel spells  taliesin no i feel it  travis up and out to it up the volcano up the water  marisha okay you know what dont worry about it lets go lets just plane shift  matt thats an arduous journey back to any possible tree  travis wanted to talk that one out  marisha yeah i plane shift us to vasselheim  matt /none/ all right so you plane shift to vasselheim as you guys encircle your hands once more  keyleth you focus on whereabouts in vasselheim  travis the trial forge  laura or meloras tree maybe  laughter and applause  sam residual magic  travis sam and taliesin trial forge  marisha where will you not get arrested  travis no ones going to even notice me yeah they were ringing the bells and running around and  getting prepared and stuff yeah and if for some reason somebodys like that guy punched me in  the face well just /dung/ punch them  taliesin i agree with this plan  marisha trial forge  matt all right with that you close your eyes beneath your breath you recite the incantation  with that you feel your body suddenly sucked into a dark void and thrust through the absence of  space and within a moments time before you can adjust to the sudden cold and dark vacuous void  around you your feet hit hard ground your eyes focus again to the light and you glance around  and the center streets not actually directly at the trial forge ooh /dung/ we got music finally in  the streets around the braving grounds you can see the smokestacks from the trial forge over the  distance you also notice that the sky above you is deep dark gray clouds its as if there is a  perpetual eclipse placed upon this ground you look around in all directions and you see this  roiling gray cloud cluster that encompasses the entirety of the sky above you which should be  midmorning or midday its blotted out by the storm rainfall is absent and you see flashes  of light occasionally framing /none/ strange shapes and clouds whether by illusion or by a trick of  your mind you swear you see shifting darkness and forms images in the clouds giant faces silently  screaming hundreds of feet across that extend and push out of the clouds and draw back into the sky  massive hands that push against them only to slowly recede moments later you blink and theyre  gone leaving you unsettled regardless and uncertain as to whether or not that was just you  or if everyone can see this  as your focus shifts from the sky above /none/ you look around and you can see bastions are stationed all  across the perimeter walls of vasselheim you see large ballistae mounted and armed as watchers  scour the distant horizon on all sides looking for any sign of something in the distance making its  way towards the city based on the warning you previously gave unlit beacons sit at every major  structure and juncture of the stone walls awaiting the burning sign that an assault is  spotted militia and armored guard move with haste to stations across the city quarters you can feel  the /none/ air of war permeating the streets  the streets are far emptier than you recall the stragglers returning to their homes with carts  full of rations produce and weapons fear grips their face as they pass by you glance off to your  left and you can see a wiry old man in the corner his tangled silver and blond hair  bouncing with fervor as he shouts out the reckoning of our opulence has come the gods are  away and the price of our hubris comes to consume us but no ones paying him mind his tattered /none/  bones jangling his knees across each other as he makes his way through the streets his face a  glance of utter despair  you notice an argument between two bastions and a middleaged bearded man who is painting a familiar  symbol on his front door not too far from where you stand a fiveyearold girl cries and clings  to his leg what do you do  taliesin what is the symbol  matt make a perception check  taliesin ill make a perception check lets see if youll roll a one again no thats much  /dung/ better 28  matt glancing at this distance you see a familiar and striking shape it is a haphazardly  drawn circle with dark reddish purple paint and a small line and a pronged fork of four prongs  painted up against this wall  marisha oh hell no  laura hes painting it on the door the guy in the city is  matt the father figure  liam yeah it could be to pass over their house  taliesin yes  marisha pass over  laura thats the vecna symbol right  matt sensing the distance of vecna /none/ hes still far to the northwest of here but what was once a  few hundred miles is now shortened about two hundred or so and getting lesser and lesser  laura fuck should we go up and talk to that guy  marisha maybe one of us maybe not all of us  laura you there  matt as you make the shout you see the soldiers are currently arguing with him one says you  welcome this rubbish are you one of them kook believers  and the father is angrily staring in his face and says you /none/ mind your business i have no love for  this but if these dreams are true i must protect my family  laura dreams  matt they turn and look at you as you approach  laura what dreams  matt the soldiers take a step back with a look of recognition across you as you step forward with  your white dragon scale armor they know not to approach and there is seemingly a sense of knowing  who you are at least from the legends that are told amongst the streets of vasselheim the father  turns to /none/ you and seeing your lordly approach and strong voice immediately the nightmares ive  had and im not the first this symbol it scares me but if something comes like they say it is i  must it let it know we have no quarrel to leave my family be  laura this symbol will not protect you  matt how do you know this  laura because i know his followers they wont have mercy theyll gouge out eyes remove your  hand and make you one of them  matt make a persuasion check please  laura okay /none/ hold on 17  matt okay he looks at you for a moment his eyes keen with fear and his face youre certain of  this my lady  laura yes  matt will you protect us then  laura well do our best thats what were here for  matt he looks past you the rest of your companions all looking wellarmed and definitely  capable looks down and rubs the hair of his little girl her sandy blonde hair curled up and a  bit dirtied looking down from her gaze up to you he says then i /none/ trust you he takes the  tattered paintbrush he was using and smears across the symbol destroying it  applause  laura dear god i hope that works  matt he goes inside with his daughter before he closes the door thank you please help pulls  the rest of the cart in and closes the door behind with a slam  the two guards awkwardly look at each other and back to you thank you  laughter  matt be safe and they both wander off  laura i dont think they noticed you grog  travis man im /none/ fucking slick  matt knowing the location youre not that far from the quadroads juncture between the different  areas you can go further towards the trial forge or back towards the center of where the quadroads  meets between that and where the platinum sanctuary and platinum dragon section is there is  the temple to sarenrae where you left pike previously what do you wish to do  marisha is the crazy zealot still running around  matt yeah he seems to be scattered through the streets hes maybe 60 feet away still shouting  obscenities and weird /none/ doomsaying prophecies  marisha i walk up to him  matt okay as hes shouting this time he will come he will destroy us you he will destroy  you too ive seen it ive seen it  marisha yeah i believe you ive seen it too  matt good then save yourself run run far  marisha wait how did he talk to you  matt in my mind in my dreams he comes he says its inevitable the clouds they come as the  first warning the first seal broken the sky has already left us the sun /none/ is gone  marisha okay yeah no accurate  matt beware the undying king and he goes to run off away  laura is he already gone  matt hes running away  marisha man i dont know how to deal with that type of abrasive personality  laura maybe its best to not let people give him power because the more people believe in him the  stronger of a god he becomes  marisha but that guy resisted he knew when others didnt and he was crazy  laura could you maybe make the sun reappear  marisha /none/ i dont know can i do a nature check to see if this is above my capabilities  matt its definitely an unnatural form of weather pattern you get the sense that this is itself a  minor miracle  marisha a minor miracle  matt well yeah the sky that stretches beyond all sides of the horizon is of similar strange  roiling cloud doom  laura is it like ghostbusters  matt its very similar yeah were talking top of the tower curling ink clouds out to each side  traveling with vast speed in almost all directions /none/ you see no plain single path in which  theyre traveling theyre emanating  marisha this seems like a minor miracle  laura yeah can you miracle more  marisha i could maybe try to carve out a patch of sunlight above us but i dont think it would be  anything more than a morale boost at this point  taliesin if we did it at a temple perhaps  laura maybe above the sarenrae temple  liam hes bearing down on us we need to tell pike we need to warn the authorities we need to  tell /none/ the temple of bahamut the slayers take  marisha we have to keep people from defecting to him the more people that he has the more of his  symbols that get spread around out of fear the more hell win  travis right but we can only either spread the word that were going to resist or spread the word  that its about time to fight we can only do one or the other  liam hes coming one way or another  marisha i turn to one of the guards of vasselheim  matt one of thems /none/ rushing past he has a cluster of spears under one arm  marisha sir  matt yes  marisha if there was a universal sign of vasselheim a symbol of vasselheim or a sign to  fight what would it be  laughter  matt there is no universal symbol there are many symbols in vasselheim all the various  divinities that lie here have their own symbol  marisha okay i didnt know if there was like a rally or cry or something that you all universally  believed in theres got to be something a symbol of vasselheim /none/  matt vasselheim is a divided and united city as one  marisha all right you know what never mind jeez your politics  matt he gives a strange glint of a glare towards your larger goliath friend right as he begins to  squint you hear a voice in the distance go lieutenant we need you  right away and he rushes off with spears under his arm  marisha thanks lieutenant for nothing okay maybe some sort of sign will help them  taliesin if were going to make a sun appear  laura lets do it at /none/ the temple of sarenrae or the temple of pelor  marisha all right we go to the temple of sarenrae  matt you make your way to the temple you enter the interior and you can see most everyone is in  silent prayer theyre all either holding hands or clutching close their smaller kin these renewed  worshippers of the everlight glancing around you dont see pike currently in the vicinity all you  see is one of the head priests coraline whos currently off to the side is tending to a few of  the folks from the /none/ interior  liam shouting pike  matt coraline looks over and sees you guys enter oh rushes up to you im sorry shes not  here she went to the platinum sanctuary apparently theres a discussion a meeting of  some kind  marisha right now  matt right now she left not but an hour ago  marisha okay go  liam thank you  matt of course  laughter  matt walking up the endless stair along the side of the mountain that signifies the northern end of  vasselheim you see small units of silver and blue /none/ armored warriors of the platinum dragon descend  past you rushing and giving you a sidelong glance as they do a nod of recognition as some of them  recognize you upon your approach  eventually through an exhausting ascent and seeing the clouds growing darker and darker you  begin to see that there is from this vantage point a very slight shift in their direction  they seem to be coming from the northwest  you eventually reach the base of the massive pillars that mark the strongholds entrance where  youve been a number of times before /town/ you immediately notice a crowd of mixed attire you  see scalebearers standing tensely along various bastion members you see warriors of the dawn fist  in their gold and red robes and you see soldiers of brass and sapphire the hand of ord is here as  well now upon approaching the guards the guards at the front gate see you and expectantly signify  for the gates to open with a shifting thudding the two large marble doorways open inside just  enough for you to pass within  you enter the central chambers the inner sanctum of /none/ the platinum sanctuary where the marble halls  lead to the familiar circular forum chambers where you last met with the highbearer vord the  silvertouched who stands there before you among his guard in heated discussion the room is  lively with representatives of each temple clustered behind their highest lord the redrobed  dawn fist of kord flank earthbreaker groon philosophers gather near holy curator curtis uleas  of the quadroads of erathis the gladekeepers of the birthheart stand behind the high hierophant  ophera while the darkveiled maidens of the raven queen gather leaderless as is their /none/ order pike  stands at the edge of the council trying to listen in before seeing you and rushing to your  side panting hi  travis pike  matt she rushes in and gives a few quick hugs did it work did you do it  travis yeah whispering we got the stuff  laura whispering we made them  matt good things are a bit tense and as she turns you see now at the back of the council  towering over most others and without armed support stands the darkskinned beautiful jmon  sa ord their simple /none/ clothing swathed in a loose hanging robe of gold and sky blue jmons  smoldering pupils shift in your direction and they give you a nod of respect the discussions  halt as you approach recognition also falling across the room at which point the highbearer  vord turns to you saying vox machina with a gift of timing have you anything to aid in this crisis  laura like so much  matt then please take the center of the chambers i believe everyone here could use some  form of good news he steps back and as the /none/ rest of the guards empty they open the central space  of the chamber for you to approach  taliesin well technically weve already been observable so theres very little that we can say  that he doesnt already know  laura hes listening right now  liam how much do you know already  matt we have only taken a bit from what your companion here pike of the everlight has said  you went off to a volcano  travis scaldseat  marisha and we defeated it  matt you defeated a volcano  travis no  marisha /none/ kind of  laura look im sure youve realized by this point that vecna has ascended to godhood  matt as he begins to speak immediately the high hierophant ophera steps forward yes the dreams  have spread weve seen and spoken with the clerics all across this land and it seems that a  new force has shoved its way amongst the rest of the pantheon though apparently closer  laura hes not reached his full power yet the only way it will happen is if he claims a great  use of power  marisha yeah performs a /none/ miracle he needs followers  laura hes on his way here the more followers he has the more power he has  matt at that when you say hes on his way here you watch as groon steps forward arms  still crossed how do you know hes coming  marisha stammers just look outside  travis keyleth hey whoa take it down  sam we dont need the sass  marisha but im not sassing  travis with respect there are those among us that can tell where he is moving  laura yeah  liam i am the /none/ paladin of the raven queen  matt at which point two of the maidens behind you say in unison together that he is and the  visions weve seen as well the pretender god his words channeled through prayers speak of a  new terror a vile tyrant unchecked believe him his words are that of our lady and both of them  step back once more  marisha have you met them before  matt they said it in unison  marisha are you friends are you on the same mailing list  liam they all look similar  /none/ laura so yeah hes got this ability  liam she has granted me knowledge of his whereabouts and he is coming fast  matt vord now speaks up from behind good then let us gather our resources the esteemed jmon sa  ord has agreed to lend aid and resources to our defense  at which point jmon speaks up this threat stretches beyond the borders of issylra the  clouds darken even our desert skies if this specter of the age of arcanum has indeed ascended  as the clerics here are convinced then it is a threat that /none/ we of ankharel cannot ignore  vord then turns his head frustratingly to the east and says and king bertrand dwendal has declined  aid claiming that until this rumored scourge arrives on dwendalian soil it is of no interest  to the crown of wildemount no resources can be spared chasing whispers we have sent out scouting  parties however as youve said this threat seems to be coming from the northwest last you  came through and wyvern riders are seeking the location of this thar amphala  at which point theres a flash of blue arcane energy /none/ in the back of the room everyone turns  the guards have their weapons drawn out ready and you spin to see a familiar blondehaired mage with  braids on the side  cheering  matt a bit out of breath and in the same flash behind a goldenarmored halfling of sunkissed  skin and long golden curling hair large weapon dragging behind allura then hand up in  resignation staff to the side we are merely here to offer counsel and communication we mean  no harm nor to bring our arcane knowledge to your quarters and i apologize /town/ but extenuating  circumstances require strange bedfellows i think you will agree however at the first sight of  threat upon taldorei understand that we will seek your assistance with haste as well emon and  the council cannot survive another catastrophe so we are here to behest and ask only youre ready to  return depending on when or where this assault strikes  theres a bit of muttering amongst the crowd and some grumbling highbearer vord nods we are in  need of aid and as many friends as we can gather you are welcome arcanist vysoren  /none/ laura allura does the sky look like this in emon  matt it in the past 12 hours or so has stretched across the ozmit sea and now seeks to  consume as far as the east coast of taldorei if this is what i believe it is within the next  halftofull day the entirety of exandria will be under the shaded sky of vecna  sam well maybe the miracle thing is just the change in weather and well be okay  laughter  sam not all miracles have to be deadly  matt very well will you /none/ be there fighting with our armies in the front line  travis we will i guess my only question is do we wait for him to come to us or do we try to  take the fight to him  matt i do not wish to fight him where he expects it as we are a city that has prided itself on its  impenetrable defenses i can guarantee you that this entity has seemingly procured or cleverly  divined some way of breaching i gather he would expect less us bringing it to him we hoped to  /none/ have information on the whereabouts of this city directly what else do we have  laura we have the knowledge that we cant take him by surprise  matt what do you mean  laura he sees everything  taliesin he hears everything  travis yeah hes been spying on us for quite some time now little shit  marisha i wouldnt be surprised if there is a spy in this room  taliesin or at least an open ear  marisha you have citizens of your city that are starting to paint his symbol on their doors out of /town/  fear this is the last thing you want in the middle of this crisis all time spent with any  volunteer hands need to be from any spare clerics who can help calm the minds of the afraid  matt he looks out amongst the rest of the crowd that has gathered here in the center inner  sanctum her words speak true if hes indeed seeking to undermine the worship of this city and  as such break the defenses of our great creators then we need whatever strength your temples have  here calming the people of /none/ vasselheim and beyond if you think he sees all  taliesin i think he sees this city as a ripe audience  matt at this point you watch as vord steps forward fiddling with one finger long ago this  grand temple nearly fell to the prying minds of terrible mages this here and he pulls a ring  from his finger is called the band of shrouds a powerful implement of the highbearer to shunt  these prying magics aside i lend it to you for the coming struggle and he passes it over to  vexahlia  laura /none/ yes  matt kept close enough to the one who wears this ring i doubt even his newly born eyes could  pierce it however it can only affect those nearby so if you are to strike perhaps its best  you do so away from his vision and we distract  laura so he cant hear us right now  matt everyone in the room takes a few steps closer to you  laughter  matt within this chamber it seems so yes  laura sighs it feels so good  liam i think that would look better on /none/ your middle finger darling  laura oh good call  matt at which point the doors in the back of the chamber burst open once more and you watch as two  armored figures come rushing up out of breath panting you see as these two wyvern riders  recognizing their armor with the horns and the large dragonlike build of their armor and  headpiece looking damaged and splashed with crimson come charging in one of them the helmet  is removed and you see a young man shouting through his wounded breaths highbearer rider  ephatus with rider /dung/ marley returning from beyond moldire and the tordusk pass we found the dark city  everyone immediately begins to mutter beneath their breath the voices begin to rise as the  highbearer puts his hand out to hush them it lies within a valley a few miles into the zenwick  mountains our team attempted to infiltrate but an unseeable barrier protects the city grounds  from all sides we found ourselves overrun by errant magics and winged beasts of shadow and  hunger only marley and myself survived we were only a scouting regiment  at which point the /town/ high hierophant steps forward zenwick of all places curious indeed  the highbearer turns again very well if this is true we must mobilize our forces very quickly  groon steps forward once more we can push our ground troops along the glasswalk road towards  the range  allura steps forward to join the conversation if we can choose some elite select numbers for an  onsite assault i can transport them  at which point the curator curtis steps in youll do nothing of the kind it is arcane  perversions that enabled this madman and we will /none/ not allow  ophera steps forward putting her hand in front of his face now saying we have druids who are  familiar with the woods surrounding the base of the zenwick mountains we could transport you to  those trees a number of you for an initial assault while the rest of our ground forces  assemble northward  at which point the wounded rider speaks up loudly i am not done my apologies only marley  and myself survived with one of our wyverns as we fled over the nearest mountaintop as fast as we  could marley /none/ saw  and the other one takes her helmet off and you can see caked with blood one eye swollen shut and  a giant wound across the face i saw the city move part of it it moved i swear it i heard a  rumble over the winds looked past and back over our shoulders and i saw the city begin to rise  silence takes the room i would like any of you with a fair amount of history to make a history check  taliesin whats a fair amount  matt if you feel confident in /none/ your ability to understand history i would say putting it this  way those who have researched the lands that would probably be percival and scanlan  taliesin okay  sam 27  taliesin 21  matt 27 okay ill make part of this a whisper  laura wait youll make what i didnt hear it  sam a live whisper  matt there are two places in the zenwick mountains that would be of any interest or  historical lorebased elements there is the crypts of thomara its a subterranean vault city  built around a precious metal vein /none/ cluster by the xenophobic dwarven thomara clan in the early years  of the age of arcana its said a terrible madness fed into their greed leading to eventual  cannibalism and collapse of the society thousands of years ago its now considered cursed and is  largely avoided the other location is known as the silted veil a small cold valley within the  mountains that is comprised of icedusted mineralrich mud that was once rumored to carry natural  healing properties when applied to wounds and restorative elements to aged skin however a  large variety of dangerous /none/ creatures also discovered these features over time and moved into  the valley taking over and establishing a new violent ecosystem based around the soothing muck  scanlan  audience member hey guys so those tshirts  laughter  laura very true there is critical role live vox machina tshirts  marisha okay so the crypts of stumbles over words tholmeer crypts of tholmayer and the  silted veil  laura silted veil and the crypts of tholmura  marisha yeah which are the two places in the zenwick mountains  laura and one is icy valley the other one /none/ is what zombie dwarves  marisha yeah  taliesin cannibal zombie dwarves  marisha angry icy terrain or cannibal zombie dwarves  laura okay  matt at this information vord nods well all forces on high for impending attack here wyvern  riders and air units we need eyes on the tordusk pass in case the city is indeed moving as they  say the high hierophant will aid in transporting advanced scouts to the base of the zenwicks we  would wish you be part of this if you are willing and able gathering information and seeking  weakness /none/ to exploit are the key vox machina you are our focused stealth strike force into thar  amphala  laura yeah were mostly really good at that  matt if you indeed carry the boons that your lady pike has mentioned then we need to keep  vecna and his force occupied to grant you entry and we can do that i certainly hope with the  strength of our numbers that there is no way that he can see them coming  from the distant end of the central chamber here a familiar voice echoes throughout the hallway  /none/ oh but i do wyrm groveler  sam but the ring man we just got the ring  matt you havent attuned to it yet  laura fuck  matt and with that were going to go ahead and take our break  cheering  laura come on  marisha what all did we say  taliesin what didnt we say  laura shit  liam what a piece of shit  matt well take our break here well return at that moment here in a number of minutes  sam ten minutes 15 minutes what are we doing  /none/ matt youll know when the lights start going well have people out there wholl let you know  it wont be too terribly long we need to get a

yeah  cheering  sam thatll work thats fine  matt thatll do all righty looking in the back booth /none/ are we good are we online perfect welcome  back everyone  so as the inner sanctum chambers of the platinum sanctuary stood silent at the recent arrival of  the vision of vecna hovering but two feet off the ground in all his lichlike glory his toothy grin  is immense threatening to crack the sides of his face as gasps fill the chamber armored warriors  thrust spear and blade towards his illusory body arrows and spells passing through harmlessly and  clattering and splashing exploding against distant pillars across the room  the smoke subsides and he /none/ stands there untouched quite the tea party youve gathered here vord i  suppose celebration is in order after all you missed my rebirthday i have something to show  you that im quite excited about dont rush the surprise friends ill bring it to you do not  fret youre all gathered here in one place it would be a perfect place for an ambush wouldnt  you say but wheres the fun in that when there are so many lessprotected loved ones to send my  shadows to  your daughter desir earthbreaker trains alone at the bozon /none/ caves an easy target vord of the  platinum dragon your family lies behind the doublesealed doors of your estate i know of your  secret cellar entrance the great protector of marquets jewel is away and your studious  concubines are left without their guard not to mention all of whitestone or cassandra young  velora vessar now plays with her owlbear doll all alone in her room  at this point allura shouts at the top of her lungs thats enough and with a wave of her  hand dispels the illusion with a flash of energy causing /none/ it to fade leaving only the lingering  omnipresent sound of vecnas chilling chuckle chuckles then silence takes the room  laura vord does this need to be attuned  laughter  matt it does  laughter  marisha why would you take it off  matt i was gifting it to you i didnt realize he was going to show up in my sanctum  laura its okay im going to sit down keep talking im going to try to attune while thats  happening  matt ophera steps forward its a distraction a bluff were close and he /none/ knows it  vord then turns to her and says i will not abandon my family vecna knows too much we have  no more time those who are primed for assault it begins now vox machina how do you wish to  proceed  laura well we cant tell you  taliesin i think we proceed by taking a 15minute nap really at this point  marisha what wait did you make a decree and then turn to us and say whats your plan  matt yes  laughter  matt you think i havent heard tales of your /none/ chaotic battle strategies i cannot attempt to  ascertain the nature of how youve survived the trials you have so i leave that entirely up to  you the rest we can handle organize and strategize  laura you do that  matt as you take a moment and rest the rest of the individuals there begin to talk amongst  themselves the other leaders begin to set their clerics and warriors sending out orders to the  various temples across all of vasselheim and beyond to prepare themselves some for the defense  of the city and some to /none/ make their way northward to wherever thar amphala will be found head on  while this happens and youre currently attuning to this ring  laura im unattuning the bracers of archery in order to attune to this ring  matt okay youre removing the bracers of archery and youre attuning to the ring thats two less  damage on your ranged attacks  laura do you have a card that i can see  marisha she wants that paper  laura i want that paper  matt the ring card is in my hotel room but you will have /town/ it next week but essentially what it  does while its attuned to you and on you within 60 feet of you at all times divination magic is  inert and cancelled  laura and whats the name of it exactly  matt it is called the band of shrouds  marisha also the hotel printer was broken  matt even getting my sheets printed out for this game has been a whole ordeal thank you dani as  this is happening and you guys are amongst yourselves figuring out what to do and the rest  of the crowd /none/ is murmuring you hear the footfalls another another another the approach of jmon  sa ord my warriors defend this city but my strength also lies in the front lines if a  distraction is what you need to succeed there are few things as distracting as a shining dragon i  will fly with the wyverns once vox machina has been delivered and the delivery shall be upon the  wings i bear if youll have me  cheering  laura dracarys  matt and they give a bow and a nod  laura has it been long enough /none/ that its attuned  matt not yet no the rest of the people are gathering about you guys are for the moment  focused inward pikes there with you there is a tension being passed around but right now theyre  letting you strategize before you bring what you have to the table right now they have nothing  until you have a strategy  sam we know of two places to go to up near the something mountains zenwick mountains  laura i dont want to talk about it for a little more time  sam sure well definitely /none/ stay here then definitely be here the whole time  marisha you know what we should go shopping  travis no fuck that we are not shopping ill quit ill leave  marisha no grog no  laura maybe we should just give up  travis what is wrong with you first shopping and now we give up what the fuck  laura no you know what vecnas right im really worried about our family we should all  split up and go be with our families right now  marisha and maybe we should convert i should just stab /none/ myself in the eye right now  laura maybe you should maybe we will lets do it  marisha lets do that  liam be priests of vecna  marisha and sam praise vecna  travis shouting what the fuck  laughter  travis take it back now  liam no i think thats a good idea sizzling and i start pushing whisper slowly  laura no okay seriously thats too far its too far dont i dont like it  sam dont worry he cant be killed just like all of us cant be killed  travis jmon im /none/ coming with you these people have lost their fucking minds  matt do not worry grog be patient i think there is more to their words than you are sit  down for the sake of brevity as everyone is cautiously waiting for the rings attunement  eventually you feel the energy click as the ring has been slipped on for this time you feel  this slight shimmer of cold wash through your body and extend outward at which point you know the  ring has finally been attuned  sam all right we can talk freely  liam /none/ show it to us how does it look  laura it looks fucking good  taliesin it looks quite nice  laura it looks great grog  travis yeah quitter  laura okay fuck vecna were not for vecna yeah i know change of heart so we have two  options right what were you saying scanlan  sam the crypts of fomora or the silted bale  laura the stilted bale  sam the silted bale  matt veil its a veil  marisha silted veil and the crypts of thromora  sam fomora  marisha fromora  sam /none/ sure we know a general sense of where were going  laura so wait were going there why  sam those are the only places that we know within the zenwick mountains that have any appeal  laura okay so we choose between those two as our strike place  sam yes one of them is filled with crazy dwarf cannibals and the other one has ice mud that can  heal you  marisha but has turned violent because nature is angry  liam the druids are dropping us off at the base of the mountain we dont really /none/ know where either  of those things are  laura maybe its best that we dont let anyone else know where were going  sam all right including ourselves  laughter  sam i like that plan  laura yeah because that way itll all be a surprise  marisha didnt he already hear our two options  marisha and laura did he  sam we dont know  travis oh my god  laura i dont know what he heard i dont know how often he listens to us i dont know any of that  marisha man how /none/ does it work does he have several lines open and he switches back and forth  laura does he have to actively listen or is it a passive thing  marisha and how bored is this guy  laura i mean thats the thing i mean hes building an army and trying to take over the  world i cant imagine hes listening to us all the time  marisha yeah hes just trolling us  liam in my opinion the gods are generally bored and looking for things to do  laura yeah but him hes doing things like /none/ hes got shit to do  taliesin im personally thinking that an undead army of cannibalistic dwarves would be very  appealing if i were starting an assault on a city like this and i would be heading my city in that  direction to raise a bunch of undead cannibalistic dwarves thats my vibe  liam so you percy want to go burn them up  taliesin i feel like thats where were going to find them and where well find them preoccupied  marisha but if we know thats what he would do then wouldnt he know that /none/ we would go to find him at  what he would do  taliesin youre assuming that hes going to do what he would expect us to think he would do in  the first place  laura do we know what kind of creatures are in the icy veil could there be ice giants there  would vecna want ice giants  marisha undead icy zombies  matt theres an entire ecosystem of very dangerous monstrosities that exist there which  means there are living and dead an elephant graveyard of various aberrations and terrible  creatures  travis /none/ well look if there are undead cannibal dwarves or whatever in the crypts dont we need  clerics to deal with them  liam we have a cleric  sam lets take her  laura pike  matt yeah  laura are you willing to leave the temple now  matt im afraid for my people there but i feel i can probably send myself with you like i have in  the past  liam its all or nothing pickle  matt i feel bad abandoning everyone that ive brought to the temple  laura you arent abandoning them /none/  liam youre shielding them  marisha you could always do like the astral projection thing right  matt thats what i was thinking of doing  laura well okay but if youre astral projecting arent you chilling in one room here  not really communicating anyway  matt make a persuasion check  marisha i dont know if its for pike or for the dm  taliesin we have a bit of a roving blind spot here that we could use  laura 13  matt 13  laura oh no but this cant be the only thing that /none/ determines if shes an astral projection or  if she comes with us  liam my begging has to count as well  laughter  marisha she destroyed a whole undead army being a laser light beam  liam yeah thats right she trond those motherfuckers  laura will everything work like normal if shes astral projection  matt ill tell you what if youre so eager to bring pike along and ashley cant play do you  guys want to jaeger her because i dont want to  laura yeah well totally jaeger her if shes okay with it /dung/  marisha remember weve talked about this theres also the thing that if she dies while  ashleys not here were fucking assholes  travis and taliesin yeah  laura okay thats very true  marisha she wont die if shes a bubbling thing  laura but if shes an astral projection can she still use the champions blessing that she got  from sarenrae and stuff  matt well find out  laura motherfuck  marisha but we can always easily go get her  travis its the best we can do  matt the dungeon master will remember /none/ that  travis all right so what the crypts or the silted veil  sam one thing that i can tell you about the crypts that you may not know theyre not manmade  crypts theyre actually the inside of a fallen titans body  laura how do you know that  sam i know things  laughter  sam it seems like a pretty godly place to go to make a statement  liam are you telling me were going to have to crawl into another monsters asshole is that what  youre saying  sam its friday  /none/ marisha and now we have two immovable rods  cheering  taliesin that got weird  sam all right  travis so the crypts  sam to the crypts i say but are we druiding there and then flying on a dragon or just flying  on a dragon  matt pikes well i mean ill come with you if thats all right if were going to this we need to do  this together i trust the city guard and if it gets real bad youll take us back right  keyleth  marisha what  matt if it /none/ gets real bad youll take us back right  marisha yeah  matt then lets do it and she puts her hand out towards grog  travis shouting fuck yeah buddy  cheering  matt it looks like most of the sanctum is now dissipating and heading out towards the front of  the temple and going about some sort of structured exit to prepare for this assault  liam allura  matt as shes standing by walking with kima theyre in a heated discussion with a member of  the paramours of the quadroads she turns vaxildan yes its /none/ good to see you  liam it is so good to see you we need advice we need help there you go when we fought vecna  he threw us around like ragdolls he held us he did whatever he wanted do you have any way any  thing any suggestion for helping us avoid his grasp again because if it went the way it went  the last time we are fucked right out of the gate  matt what do you perceive as the weaknesses you suffered in that previous battle  liam what was that  matt /none/ what do you perceive are the weaknesses that you suffered in that previous battle  liam he was able to hold us magically  matt there are ways to make sure those bindings dont hold you still there are magics that can  prevent that and if your enemy is as strong a magic user as i know he will use distance to his  advantage close that distance and make it your advantage i know not quite what hes capable of  in his new ascended form and that scares me but strike quickly strike true everything youve  /none/ got work together communicate and anything you can do to allow yourself preparation and the jump  on this fray do it that ring that vord gave you thatll be a boon enough if you can catch him off  guard that might mean everything  liam thank you  laura do you know what kind of magic it is that keeps him from holding us just wondering you  said there were kinds but i want to make sure  matt certainly there are a few in your midst that you can utilize theres a spell called  freedom /none/ of movement that can prevent being held or paralyzed in that way  laura thats good just making sure because i thought that was what it was i just wanted to  doublecheck  matt completely understood  sam well shall we away then we have to go now  matt id like to come with you but currently with everything going on lets be honest if im  not there amongst the council its going to tear itself apart the sky as it is the people of emon  are threatening all sorts of insanity im sure youve seen /none/ shades of it here in a city which  has faith i myself am not completely absolved of the dreams that haunt many others ill be  doing what i can to pay attention but do note that ring also prevents me from seeing in on you  and i have to look out for emon me and my lady both  she turns over to kima who is currently in the process of getting into an argument with a wyvern  rider you see her going oh come on i can ride too  have you ever ridden a /none/ wyvern  no but i havent met a wyvern i cant stare down wyvern rider turns around and chuckles and  gets tripped immediately onto his face the crush of metal on the banks and he spins over and she  harrumphs spins around and joins alluras side and goes i never really liked this place bunch  of pricks good to see you guys  travis you as well that holy avenger getting some action lately  matt oh nowhere near enough thats okay you come back and you and me will have a tussle  travis god i /none/ love kima so much  matt dont be all doom and gloom all right thats a promise stay alive  travis laura and liam singing stay alive  matt she looks up and allura looks down at her and rubs the top of her head for a second kima  pulls away come back safe okay im going to hold you to that and you see theres a moment of  her sniffles and she spins around not wanting to show any weakness or emotion  allura looks back and watches her turn away and goes youll make it through /none/ this ive seen you  do great things  sam well try  matt and youll succeed you have to you have many at your back look and she puts her hand  out and you can see now theres at least over 100 wyvern riders all scattered amongst the various  mountain outcroppings that are all getting on top of their great winged beasts that are fully  armored with wyvern barding and armor theyre taking off in clusters and circling theyre all  counting on you theyre going to make sure that you have the opportunity you have /none/ to put those to  good use and she glances off to the side of your pouch closed as it is come back she turns  around to go and join kima  laura give gilmore a hug for us will you  matt she stops and turns ill do that i owe him a visit anyway  liam and if he has any trinkets that lend freedom of movement well place an order  matt ill ask  liam tell him we say hi  matt i will and im sure he does as well take care be safe /none/ come back she turns and walks  away  marisha did you see that  laura see what  marisha they think were going to die  laughter  sam theyre right  taliesin safe bet  travis i feel pretty encouraged  laura yeah  travis i dont know why  laura well im glad  marisha so what exactly is our plan is it to try and keep vecna from gaining more forces or are we  trying to cut off vecna and his forces  laura i think theyre taking care of the forces were taking care /none/ of the god  taliesin theyre the distraction  marisha then why go through the crypt  taliesin we think thats where theyre headed  liam but are we trying to take out potential additional forces  taliesin thatd be my thought thats where i would go  marisha is that not what other people are doing  taliesin i think that the surprise that hes expecting to bring to the city possibly  especially with the information you brought is that he would try and raise this creature and use  it against the city  laura so hes /none/ basically wanting to raise a giant zombie titan full of zombie cannibal dwarves and  then theyll poo them out to fight other people  taliesin somehow you make that less threatening im not sure how you do that  liam you know its like when you take a duck and you put it inside a chicken and then you put the  chicken inside a turkey  sam well lets get going before he starts raising this thing come on  taliesin turducken of the damned  laughter  laura heres the thing are we relying on grog to /none/ stab these trammels through vecna  liam or do we each need to deliver the one tied to our gods  taliesin if we can all three in one swift movement once weve weakened  laura it takes three separate attacks im assuming right or would it be attack attack  attack  laughter  taliesin so much sass  matt you gather by the nature of their enchantment and the size of it you cant cluster  them together like darts and jam them into the board at once  laura okay but it would be one of those /none/ situations where youd have to attack and then  draw another one and then attack right  matt its possible  sam or three of us could each have one  marisha but he mentioned vecna has to be severely damaged  laura already before we even do that  matt there have to be breaks in the avatar form for them to pierce there have to be breaks  wounds visible cracks in the veneer of the avatar for the actual trammels to pierce  marisha so were talking about doing this hey dm logistical question how many days /none/ does it  take me to make a 4thlevel scroll spell spell scroll 4thlevel how many days  travis say it a couple more times  matt thats going to be quite a while thats weeks and weeks and weeks thats a downtime  activity  sam i thought our whole deal was were about to go do a surprise attack we have to go now  laura we do were saying we dont have time to make a scroll spell scroll scroll spell scroll  marisha allura also said yo plan maybe plan a little  liam also dm /none/ did we get told for these trammels for these harpoons that they need to be  wielded by the person associated to their gods or can grog chuck them all  matt from what you understand there was no specification of that it was more the fusing of  the divine energy within the trammels creation grants it with the power the means of delivering  it doesnt seem to be as important  laura but it is a melee weapon  matt its javelinlike it could be thrown  taliesin we didnt make them to be aerodynamic did we /none/  matt theyre somewhat aerodynamic by nature once again you can certainly try  laura im going to pass the pelor trammel back to you  marisha i have freedom of movement but i have three 4thlevel spells i can start burning into  my 5thlevel spells as well but it lasts for an hour so i was trying to figure out if theres a way  matt pike says i can also do it  marisha oh yeah  laura and its not concentration right so you can also cast death ward  matt it lasts for an hour /none/  taliesin well wait until were a little closer  laura and death ward lasts for eight hours  matt death ward yes theyre both 4thlevel though  travis these words are all great and everything but its not going to change that were going to  have to make it up when we get there so why dont we go ahead and fight this fucking fucker  cheering  matt as you begin to descend down the stairs on the outskirts of the mountainside you can see  the wyvern riders have now gathered into two large units and /none/ in the distance shrieks of wyvern calls  begin to echo through the mountain range they all begin to swoop towards the abundant terrace you  guys follow suit  laura sure  matt all right as you make your way to the abundant terrace on the outskirts of the  birthheart there are the orchards the large clusters of trees that you have traveled to and  from before when travelling to and from vasselheim at keyleths behest and there you can see a  number of the high priest druids of melora have all gathered around the high /none/ hierophant and  theyre preparing means of transport for all the troops wyverns included to those that are going  to make it as part of this initial frontline assault as you guys approach and watch you see  as other generals and such begin to gather their army units they begin to discuss orders and a  number of them in the middle of this refer over to you guys you can see theres definitely direction  being given in regards to you guys someone wants to stop their alarm  taliesin okay this is going to be weird /none/  laura is it yours  taliesin its that  matt oh theres an actual alarm on the stage  marisha oh my god there is  sam when it turned 12 midnight the alarm clock went off  matt its not flashing  marisha thats hilarious  matt thank you taliesin  cheering  laura he just hit snooze you guys  liam yeah five more minutes raven mom five more minutes  laura it was all a dream  matt as you approach ophera steps up it would be my honor to grant you passage to the base /none/ of  the mountain range i believe your other companion is approaching soon as well and she looks over  past your shoulder as you glance and you see jmon sa ord approaching within their arms is a small  leather chest a container of some kind jmon steps up and places it before you pulls it back  and backs away with a brandishing presentation  laura what is it  matt may these potions keep you healthy within here there are eight superior healing potions  laura whoa okay  travis well were really in for a fucking /none/ fight huh when the game gives you eight superiors  laura so everybody take one superior right  sam everybody gets one  matt and theres one extra  liam they are so fucking badass  laura everybody gets one and theres one extra  matt yeah because there are eight and you have seven in your party  laura im going to mark down that pike has one  taliesin and whos made of the most glass whos going to get hit the most  liam scanlan is important  laura scanlans super important  liam scanlan should have /town/ two  sam guys im fine  laughter  laura i know youre very fine and youre very capable  liam also karma is a thing and i really want to balance the scales  sam why would you feel any pressure that way  liam weve got a long road of history you and i  sam were best buds  liam best buds best buds met at big apple anime fest in new york city all those years ago  audience aww  sam all right ill take two  laura yeah okay  sam in marquesian i /none/ say thank you jmon sa ord  matt be pleased  laura we are very  sam also if you dont like the meat man i can make him go away  matt their business has not encroached upon the order that we maintain yet  laughter  matt youd know if it did  liam whispers they know  matt the smoldering pupils that they contain within their darkened eyes stare back at you with  a curling smile  sam thank you lets go weve got to get through this druidy thing right  matt ophera backs up /none/ and putting her staff to one side makes a large oval shape with her fingers as  she mutters beneath her breath you watch as one of the heavy thick trunks of the nearest tree  begins to tear and crack and pull inward and there you see in a similar fashion to keyleths  casting though a little more visceral an opening reveals itself and a doorway is opened and she  goes quick now  marisha i like your technique  matt you all rush through one after another flanked at the end by jmon and as you /none/ all  approach the opposite side of this portal you emerge in a somewhat crowded forest of pine trees  immediately the northern air is colder and you see drifting bits of snowfall softly coming  through bits of the tree line above you you turn around just in time to see the doorway close and  in the distance you see other doorways opening around you in different trees and you watch as  dozens upon dozens of wyvern riders and armored soldiers begin to emerge one cluster after the next  marisha fucking druids are badass  taliesin /none/ lets do this  matt you glance up and can briefly see the top northern crest of where the zenwick mountain pass  is just past the canopy of the forest youre in because you were sent to the very slim base of the  zenwick mountains youre within a forest what do you want to do  liam what does my vecdar tell me  matt interestingly enough southeast of where you are  liam shit  laura how close  matt id say its probably close to four miles from where you are  laura oh shit  /none/ matt and slowly moving away  liam we guessed wrong  marisha four miles  taliesin did we guess wrong  liam well we dont know where this shit is that were looking for  sam do we know where these things are  matt theyre both northwest of where you are in the mountain range  marisha hes passed them  liam passed over  matt hes passed over it seems  liam fuck  sam what do we do  marisha if we get a little bit closer i can do a commune with nature spell and try /none/ and figure out  some stuff its all ive got i can scry  laura i mean if hes already passed by the crypts is there any reason to go there i dont  understand  travis what direction is vasselheim from us now  matt southeast  marisha the way theyre heading  travis anybody else think we should fucking hop on a bigass brass dragon and try and catch him  before he gets there what are we going to do here theres nothing to do here  laura you want us to go fight vecna right now /none/  travis either that or he goes and sacks the city and were like what does this tree tell me about  this area  laughter  liam quickly please someone come up with an argument that counteracts that  taliesin we should scry on the dwarven city if we can really quickly  sam how we dont know much about it  taliesin do we know enough to scry  marisha i can scry on lady briarwood  laura do it do it right now  taliesin and marisha ooh  marisha yeah i bet shes with him  /none/ taliesin or shes not  liam well learn something  laura are you zoning in on the city or are you zoning in on vecna  taliesin we know where vecna is we just need to see where lady briarwood is  marisha all right scrying on briarwood oh she rolls  matt she rolls to make a saving roll spell dc is  marisha 21  matt and that is a 22  groaning  matt sorry as you try and focus the incantation completes and as your vision begins to extend it  is blocked by darkness and /dung/ sent back into your form and you realize the scry has failed the  will is too strong  laura can you scry on that death knight guy that was next to her  marisha is he still with her though  laura we didnt kill him we did not kill him we did not hit him we did not  laughter  marisha oh hi vex all right ill scry on undead douchey  matt as your vision extends from you it races through the darkness you see dark clouds ahead  as it fires down you look instantly /town/ within the streets of thar amphala you see the cobblestone  roads now cracked and broken you see buildings appear to have sustained structural damage you  see roofs are partially collapsed and walking down the street strolling with a number of undead  soldiers at its back the black knight you battled before as it struts through you watch as the  towers and buildings rumbling shake and shake again and your vision returns  taliesin oh shit  marisha it was shaking oh is it on the back of some giant turtle or something  laughter  taliesin /none/ we should stop that from happening  travis yeah were super lucky and its just a turtle  laughter  travis how lucky for us  marisha itd be so cute  matt then there is no time to waste you watch as jmon sa ords form shifts and giant brass  wings extend in a flash of reddishorange energy the nearby trees bend and break at the sheer force  of the dragons magnitude their form expanding to fill the recent vicinity of the forest and with a  large guttural roar you see before you the brass dragon /none/  sam shotgun  laura hey keyleth while were flying through the air is it possible for you to give us a nice  inspiring speech  marisha oh giggles  travis laughs  liam its all right its just our small group here no ones watching you know us  marisha yeah man inspiring speech so were on a brass dragon  matt you can do it while youre all climbing on the back theyre waiting patiently for you all to  jump onto the back of the dragon form  sam if you need a second to think /none/ about it its okay we can start off first and then come back to you  marisha wait what  sam do you need a second to compose yourself  marisha you know scanlan  cheering  marisha its funny you should mention that because i do need a second i have to think about  my words deeply and a long time and even still they come out wrong and youre so witty and  quick and you can come up with things like speeches and songs on the fly in front of  thousands of people way quicker /none/ than i can it is not my strength but i do know my strength and i  know each of your strengths but not as well of each of you know your strengths as well as you do  sam sing it sister  marisha what im saying is you should believe in yourselves the way that i believe in you scanlan  and the way that you believe in everyone else scanlan because youre all strong and unique and  were probably going to die  laughter  marisha stammers okay lets fly ahoy  matt with a slow /dung/ metallic crinkling sound of brass dragon scales curling the large head of  jmon sa ords dragon form spins around to look you dead in the face keyleth the same dark eyes  with the smoldering burning cores for pupils the mouth opens and you can smell immediately the  breath that has a very earthy singed burntwood scent to it  marisha ooh cedar  matt and the voice goes forth very good keyleth i found that quite inspiring  cheering  matt and with that you guys can all take your 18 temporary hit points  travis how /none/ much is it  taliesin 18 temporary hit points  matt and with that note with one large push of their strong dragon wings jmon sa ord raises  beyond the treeline up into the sky above where you can see the clusters of wyvern riders have now  also gathered to survey the territory the first thing you notice the southward wall the tall  rocky landscape surrounding the fields of ice dust and grasses that fill this pass you can see  the mountain range seems to have suffered an immense amount of damage a gargantuan fresh  /none/ rockslide nearly a mile wide now resting at the base of the northern mountain you can see  swallowing and burying some of the forest land  and as you glance southward into the tordusk pass you can see mammoth holes in the ground large  craters of broken dirt and rock forced into dunes of mud and shale surrounding their outsides the  scars pockmarks 200 feet across carved into the terrain id like everyone to make an intelligence  check please  laura were making a what an intelligence check  marisha can i do a nature check /none/  matt sure  marisha yeah  cheering  matt vexahlia  laura is this an intelligence  matt yes this is your intelligence modifier  laura 21  matt 21 good vax  liam oh man eight  matt keyleth  marisha i am doing a nature check  matt right to find out  marisha if it looks like a path has been bore through in a straight line like it looks like  its going through 24  matt 24 what you can tell from a nature check is that these are not natural formations in the /none/  ground these are blunt trauma to the ground that has caused these large craters  laura does it look like a walking path a very large walking path  matt percival  taliesin natural 20 for 25  matt scanlan  sam 19 total  matt okay percival and keyleth and percahlia not you grog sorry  travis holes  matt you do notice upon immediate view that these large holes are patterned staggered about  every 350400 feet and they do almost present the gait of a walking creature  marisha anguished sounds  travis hey you got /none/ that big fucking turtle you wanted  marisha it is a giant turtle  liam the final miniature is just matt  matt it has been foreseen ive been working on my costume  laura do we see anything in the air any of those shadow creatures or is it just our wyvern  riders  matt make a perception check  laura natural 20  matt okay as you lift up to survey more territory you manage to get a brief view over the  edge of that mountain range you do not see any of the gloomstalkers that /none/ you had previously faced  near thar amphala in the vicinity there is only the wyvern riders and a few errant birds that  normally take to the skies that are keeping a wide berth from your sudden emerging army that has  joined you in the skies you glance over this mountain range and you look about about two  three miles northward you can see the same path of destruction has torn through these mountain  ranges in a sinkhole hundreds and hundreds of feet across that disappears into darkness  laura is the sinkhole in the direction /none/ of the city thats moving right now  matt no its in the direction you guys were planning to travel  sam oh maybe thats where they ripped the thing out  taliesin its where it came out how big are these footprints approximately  laura shouting thats the fucking titan its the titan full of dwarf bodies i just realized that  laughter  marisha it totally fucking is yeah yeah  liam and his name is larkin  laughter  laura shit i thought it was just a really big giant and then i remembered it was a /none/ titan  matt yes each one of these craters is roughly 150 or so feet across  sam oh his feet are a hundred feet across  matt 150 to 200 feet across yeah  taliesin keyleth how big would a creature be if it had footprints approximately 150 to 200 feet  across  sam at least a hundred feet big  marisha probably bigger  sam maybe even bigger  marisha can i do a nature check to find out how fucking big this guy is  matt sure  marisha yeah lets do this lucky one thats /none/ not too bad 28  matt based on your experience with various creatures that leave large tracks youve dealt  with or hunted in your history with the ashari its big the legs generally are pretty thick  for a creature of immense size because it has to support all that weight but if each footfall  crater here is about 150 200 feet wide you can surmise the creature is hundreds of feet tall  travis at least six times  laura at least 600 feet tall what did you say  liam i said were going to have /none/ to shadow of colossus this shit  laura how are we going to fucking fight something thats 600 feet tall  travis if it bleeds we were going to die  laughter  marisha hang on though caverns undead caverns of dwarves inside the titan  liam yeah maybe we crawl up its butthole and kill the things inside  marisha yeah maybe or fight it from the inside out  laura maybe  taliesin thats the most exciting dwarven forge thing id ever want to see the godzilla  interior  laura we got to get inside of it /none/  taliesin it may be all it takes  laura are we on jmon sa ords back  matt yes right now its large brass dragon wings flapping  taliesin neverending storying our way to a terrible death  travis can you detect if were making up any ground on your target im talking to you vax  sam liam are we getting closer  liam my brains on vecna not on the city is vecna doing a ridealong is he still moving in  the same direction  matt yeah vecnas slowly traveling in that southeast direction  sam /none/ follow the tracks then  matt all right with that you hear the booming voice of jmon once more very well let us be  off whoosh and goes into a fastpaced dive you all grab a hold of nearby dragon scale andor  loose bits of fur there are as it drives into this huge dive this gargantuan dragon  laura trinkets in the necklace for this part  matt i assumed as such  travis and liam scared bear noises  matt you see as the wyvern riders immediately take this action and begin to swoop and follow /none/  suit as well following behind them at this point you are the tip of the spear of this assault at  this very moment you begin to follow this pattern cross the pass heading southsoutheast  heading over and through different mountain ranges the higher you get the wind gets a little  more intense and the cold begins to get more biting and jmon dips down a bit to avoid having  to thrust you into this very dangerous stratosphere the light in this area is very close  to near dusk almost with how much the sunlight /none/ is blotted out by the cloud cover that has completely  consumed the skyline from horizon to horizon on all sides  marisha i do a bit of a gust spell ahead of us to clear the path give him a little more visual line  of sight  matt thank you you hear emanate from jmon as the cloud cover tends to spread a little bit and  give a little bit of a good view you travel on for about 25 30 or so minutes before vex vax  and keyleth you glance around the bend of the /none/ pass that youve just begun to curve around and  you see it an impossibly immense entity standing hundreds and hundreds of feet tall a gigantic  bulky mass of jagged rock slowly walking on two castlewidth legs each footfall sending a  cloudspray of earth into the air around it crashing quaking the surrounding lands with a  terrifying crack and rumble as the back leg lifts sifting through the air you can almost  hear the air tear with a highpitched whine even at this distance as its sheer mass and speed in  which its cutting through /none/ breaking the atmosphere slams down for its next step  crashing as you get a better view the closer you get it resembles the earth elemental form  youve seen keyleth take many times only proportionally malformed and terrifying on a  scale youve never seen four colossal arms swing from its torso battering rams of shifting  stone each over 150 feet wide the closer you get grog you sense a faint vibration in the  titanstone knuckles  travis oh my fucking god just a note these were made from the heart of a felled titan i dont /none/  think its that one  laura it could be that ones dead  travis that was sarcasm but yeah  sam are you going to take him one on one  laura does that mean you can beat him up from the inside  travis oh yeah beat him up with his heart  laura yeah  travis stammering do i notice anything  matt not in particular you clap and it sounds booming as it would the closer you get you  sense this very faint vibration to them as if proximity keys you in and even your /none/ simple  mind grog can gather that these were crafted and made from whatever it is you see storming  through that ravine  taliesin okay  liam do i feel vecna riding on this guys shoulder  matt you sense the direction and distance of vecna directly where this entity lies i would  like you to make a perception check please  laura do a what  matt perception check just him for now as hes focusing  liam 27  matt you glance past as your proximity grows closer and closer one you notice that there are /none/  beehivetype activity around the top where its head would be there is no massive head  protruding just the shoulder shelf where the top of it becomes these four arms and its faced away from  you facing the way its traveling its arms swinging wildly with each step slowly its size  is difficult for you to fathom at this distance it seems so big yet so small as you get closer  you can see these bee swarmlike clusters resemble creatures you saw in the shadowfell not  too long ago and there atop the shelf of /none/ its gargantuan torso you see a cityline resting atop of  this entity there lies a portion of thar amphala moving with this gargantuan primordial earth  titan risen from below its longheld tomb  laura im going to cast pass without a trace on us its not going to make any difference but im  going to do it  taliesin will that work on the back of a big shiny dragon  travis another note to be clear these were carved from the heart stone of a ruined earth  primordial when theyre doing their thing they make /none/ me resistant to fire cold and lightning  damage so thats good  marisha yeah theory time maybe this primordial is marching with thar amphala on its back to  vasselheim if i were a god wanting to prove that im awesome and do a big miracle thing i would  drop a giant city on top of another city  travis or destroy the city and replace it with that one  sam we can stop this though all we have to do is beat the titan ive got magic missiles that  can do 1d6 damage  matt /none/ 1d4 plus one  sam we could be in business  travis listen i know it seems really dire right but the only other option besides attacking  it in my mind is trying to get its attention maybe lead it away from vasselheim  taliesin i think its also in theory necrotic which means it can be turned  laura that would be one powerful fucking spell  taliesin were going to have to do something  laura pike how strong are you feeling right now  matt you look back at pike whos clutching onto the back of /none/ jmon sa ord seeing this her face  pale white eyes wide shes like i dont know  travis its all right buddy  laura you got it youre a monster  matt weakly im a monster its also a monster  laughter  sam should we land on the city on its back or should we try to fuck up the titan  laura i think we should dive into one of the beehive tunnels and stealth in i think we  should still be stealth mode jmon can drop us off jmon you distract all of the city /none/ with all  of your wyvern riders as well and well come in from the bottom up yeah  matt i think that is a very sound plan however and as the dragons head turns and looks  ahead you can see some of these clusters of gloomstalkers have broken away from the titan  swarming in your direction youre about id say a mile and a half away from it and gaining only  because youre pushing at full speed youre seeing now them breaking off into the clusters and  you hear the distant screeching  travis i /none/ know we bamfed out here but do we have any idea how much time we have how far away from  vasselheim we are  sam how far have we gone  matt fom what you can tell make a  travis dont make me make it no im ready lets go  laura im going to guess too because hes asking out loud  marisha and taliesin its a good question  matt make a nature check  marisha can i do it too  travis negative two  laughter  travis my modifier my modifier so 15 it /none/ was 17 i was excited  matt not too bad you havent traversed this area of the north side of issylra before but gathering  based on where you were seeing the sinkhole and the distance that vaxildan was giving you  earlier you imagine its probably about 200 miles or so away from vasselheim  travis okay weve got time not a lot  matt it has a very wide gait with each step  travis but its like godzilla right its like groaning thud  matt yeah so you have time but its not 200 miles on normal /none/ person feet  travis i mean if he starts skipping were fucked  laura hey keyleth do you have any of that wild guide is that whats it called that herb that scares away  the undead  marisha i do well i grabbed some so i can cultivate more of it yeah  laura you should probably do that  liam theyre a mile and a half away and they see us it looks like  matt yeah theyre closing in theres a short time before they reach you remember at this  traveling speed any sort of smokebased /none/ censer material is going to go right behind you like a flare  liam can we turn into clouds keyleth and fly off of our dragon ride and poof inside the titan  marisha let me see what i packed  travis wed be in the air and not all of us are so awesome in the air  laura we could fall off this dragons back real fast  marisha okay we could do wind walk its going to take a minute to transform in and out i also  have animal shapes  sam jmon can you become /dung/ invisible by any chance  matt jmon you hear the voice rumble i can but only myself i could maybe affect a couple of you  sam i could affect a couple of us  laura how many  sam three  laura that leaves quite a few of us left maybe jmon could you get  liam five  matt i could muster about four  travis thats enough three and four  liam pike  travis i cant add  sam or i could make jmon look like one of those dark flappy things and make us look /none/ like undead  creatures  laura they probably have seen us coming though theyre on their way here  sam yeah invisible then  taliesin at least were a smaller target at that point  marisha i can throw out a fog cloud and try and fog us the rest of the way  sam well fly through it it wont work  marisha were in clouds  sam if you do the thing well keep going through it  marisha oh yeah thats a good point  travis invisible or change us one or the other  liam you /none/ could do invisible and i could fly as fast as i fucking can away  matt screeching the cloud breaks ahead and you watch as two gloomstalkers come diving down  towards the back of jmon  sam lets do invisible  laura i shoot one with an arrow  taliesin i shoot the other one with a gun  matt both of you guys roll attacks  taliesin its okay were going at a speed that it doesnt matter did that just happen  sam yeah i just knocked over a wine bottle  matt and travis a grape /none/ juice bottle  laura 28  matt 28 hits  taliesin counting 25  matt 25 hits as well  taliesin i should have said this i was going to burn a grit to drop  matt right i figured that was the case one of them gets shot with an arrow and as the impact  hits it shrieks but continues its dive the second one gets shot by which weapon was it  taliesin animus  matt with animus you watch as the detonation of the spray of black from the impact of the bullet  hitting as /none/ it shrieks its wings buckle from underneath and it plummets about 30 or 40 feet or  so and falls out of its dive the one however is still diving and its going to go for the one  that shot it with its arrow natural two thats going to be a 13 im pretty sure that doesnt hit you  laura no that doesnt hit  matt as it attempts to dive past you you duck out of the way still nocking a secondary arrow  its claws hits the back of the dragon scales you hear the scrape /none/ of it going across the back but  having no effect on the hard armored brass dragons back the gloomstalker then shrieks once  more and takes back up into the clouds and vanishes  liam did i get an attack of opportunity on it with daggers  matt you can definitely attack it with daggers if youd like  liam yeah that hits 29  matt that hits  liam if my friend the dragon is against it do i get sneak attack  matt no sorry  liam all right that is 12 for that  matt 12 /none/ damage how much damage did you do  laura 15  matt as it shrieks and vanishes back into the clouds above you can see now the wyvern riders around  are starting to charge in as well as youre rushing now youre maybe threequarters of a mile from  the exterior of this giant earth titan  laura invisible  matt all right you complete your incantation in time with jmon and the entirety of your party  turns transparent and is now free from visual perspective  liam did we get everybody  matt you did three  /none/ sam i can do four if jmon cant  matt jmon can do four well pike and jmon would be eight  sam okay so well do four and four  matt and with that you all manage to disappear and go into a dive as soon as you all vanish  which is interesting because you disappear and suddenly your mount disappears and all your  friends disappear so youre clutching on to what you hope is still dragon scales and fur as you  look down and see clouds ground mountains and eventual plummeting death were you not /none/ holding  onto the back of the dragon  travis screams  taliesin wait if our eyelids are invisible does that mean we cant even close our eyes  matt you can close your eyes  taliesin no its too much too much not cool  matt i will say because the enchantment doesnt make you translucent just invisible to the visual  gaze the interior of your eyelids would not be affected by it  taliesin okay thats my worst nightmare  matt much like a harry potter invisibility cloak you can still see the inside of the cloak /none/  somewhat  taliesin yeah no i was just having a clockwork orange moment  marisha you make yourself more nauseous by closing your eyes  taliesin thats not true  matt as you go into this dive you can hear the clashing of wyvern against gloomstalker you hear  the yelps and the shrieks of two different bestial cries you hear shouts of humanoid and elven  voices shouting as spears are tossed arrows are let loose and this aerial fray begins with that  you glance forward as the dragon comes out of a dive jmon leading you /none/ towards this gargantuan  entity you can hear the further volume the massive footsteps even slower than that  probably based on the gait it has to walk and the speed its going it is like watching a mountain  with legs move as you approach what do you do  sam do we see a clearing a landing spot  matt you can make a perception check guys all of you  laura 25  marisha 30  taliesin 24  travis six  sam eight  matt eight awesome all right keyleth you guys at this distance its /none/ hard to make out  details but keyleth you rolled a 30 which according to 5th edition is nearly impossible as a  dc so you glance about and amongst the broken rock exterior of this behemoth entity you can see  towards the base of its right leg towards the back a faint trickle of water like a waterfall  of pee probably a trickling of a waterfall thats flowing from its back leg area and then  dissipating as it plummets into the air  marisha thats it  sam is it coming from the city or coming /none/ from the titan  matt from the titan  marisha hes leaking from the back of his calf  laura lets go in there then  marisha from the back of his hip  taliesin lets see if we can land on that burst pimple then  marisha i dont think theres any landing i think theres going to be yeah but you know  what lets see what happens  laura lets fly in close to that waterfall  matt okay so you point this out to jmon all right you hear the dragon voice boom up once  /none/ more hold on goes into an intense dive trying to bring because previously you were about level  if not a little higher than thar amphala on the top of the entity jmon goes into a dive towards  the hip area that you point out the wind is pushing past you youre holding on for dear life  because any possible loss of grip not only is going to loose you from the dragon which is going  to be hard to find you as youre all invisible depending on the dragons abilities i guess but  as you /none/ begin to push down into this dive i want you all to make strength saving throws please  laura oh god strength jeez louise  travis natural 20  taliesin natural 20  cheering  groaning  sam i got an 11  liam im using my first luck of the day oh thats worse that is a nine for me  laura god a 22 for me i know  marisha this is a group success or failure thing right  matt in almost a poetic justice way both vax and keyleth begin to lose their grip and with /none/ a  sequence of moments they both get blown off the back of the brass dragon  laura we wouldnt even know were they touching each other tell me they were  matt you and vax are currently now no grip on any dragon  marisha vax whisper  liam i throw my dagger at that sound  matt roll an attack  marisha wait what  travis that sounds like us  liam were you saying you were going to come to me theres the 18  matt with disadvantage because she is invisible  liam thats a 20 /none/  matt whats your armor class keyleth  marisha he hits  laura good so you can bamf to her  liam thats right 12 plus psychic damage honey  sam you guys have a fuckedup relationship  marisha our entire relationship has been psychic damage baby  liam 14  matt so you take 14 points of piercing damage however as soon as the pain hits you its  immediately allayed by the impact of vaxs arms wrapping around you for dear life  marisha sputtering  liam im kissing you already  matt you both are now tumbling /none/ and plummeting through the sky  liam do you want to fly or should i  marisha hold on and i go giant eagle form  matt okay the giant eagle form takes flight as her wings extend you realize youve been  clutching on to the under down feathers as soon as the form takes you grasp hold and climb back  onto the top of the giant eagle with that you both whooshing now heres an interesting  question because invisibility lasts until you do an attack or cast a spell its a magical ability  im going /none/ to say that because its a natural effect it will not affect the invisibility  especially because youre at a high enough druid level specifically shape changing is your thing  so ill say you skirt under what would reveal invisibility you lose it however for attacking  her so now theres a vax huddled on nothing fullon wonder womanstyle invisible jet riding  through the sky so as you guys coast in the rest of you hear jmon go it appears weve lost some  passengers  marisha no keep going cawing tell them keep going  liam were /none/ all right everythings fine here everythings fine how are you  sam jmon they say theyre okay its okay we can go  matt very well continues into the dive you guys are trailing behind at this point but making  your way down towards the hip region of this entity following the direction that keyleth gave  at her spotting earlier as you guys get closer and closer you can see there is indeed a  trickle of a waterfall that is dissipating the wind is so strong that it gets maybe 25 or 30 feet  down before /none/ it gets scattered into droplets  sam is it peecolored  matt no it is actually pretty clear water you do also glance as you get closer it appears to  be emerging from some sort of an opening like a cavern entrance  laura yeah lets head for the opening  matt so as you approach  laura we have pass without a trace  matt you do but the flying man does not so as the rest of you make it up towards the side and  the wind is strong here you can hear the impact of /none/ each footfall so deafening your eardrums  almost shake and are in pain with each impact the bass of each footfall is immense but you do see  interestingly enough there is the waterfall coming out of it the waterfall is careening down  a broken stone staircase the opening is about 15 feet across and about ten feet wide it  looks like it was at some point attached before this creature arose to another series of tunnels  or wherever else this dwarven stronghold this series of vaults that were carved within this  creatures body extended beyond /none/ its torso this is one of the breaking points as you glance back  you can see your brother coasting down about a hundred or so feet away you also watch as one of  the large arms swings back  laura no  marisha i dodge it i try and dodge it  matt i need both of you guys to make dexterity saving throws actually because youre riding  keyleth right now its going to be on the giant eagle form because youre clutching it  marisha its just on me  matt its just on you its /none/ hard to avoid a hundredplusfootwide arm  liam this is a save wait this is a dex save right im blessing keyleth  matt as you see it coming ill say you have the time because its so immense  marisha add a d4 yeah four yeah okay 24 total  matt thats not enough you were one away its a 25 dc because this is a giant fucking arm both  you and vax i dont have the dice for this so im going to have to use the app you both suffer  87 points of bludgeoning damage /none/ as the force of a mountain slams into the side of your halfelf and  eagle form  marisha you said 87  matt 87 points of bludgeoning damage yes  marisha okay i immediately drop form and start falling  matt okay any carryover damage make sure to mark that  liam does uncanny dodge affect this at all  matt unfortunately because you were relying on her eagle maneuverability no  liam okay well then i shoot the wings out immediately  matt okay the wings emerge as both of you begin to plummet at this point  /none/ marisha im okay  matt keyleth as youre plummeting vax i need you to roll a perception check  sam jmon theyre fine they told us theyre fine theyll be here any second dont worry  taliesin we did see this happen right  matt you guys are right now hovering by this and looking back you watch this occur you see vax  get smacked fall and then his wings shoot out vax roll a perception check with disadvantage  taliesin roll really high twice  liam i rolled the same thing so its a 24 reliable talent  /none/ matt strangely youre able to see a slight shift in wind to give you a brief moment to see where  keyleths invisible plummeting body is  marisha oh im still invisible as im falling  matt yeah because you havent cast a spell or any attacks so you manage to see this brief  shimmer in space where the wind bends around her reverting form  liam i pick it up grab it  matt you thrust downward with your wings you grab her body and manage to carry you can feel  her invisible body below you as /none/ you bring it back up  liam punch me in the face punch me in the face right now  marisha yelling  liam hey beautiful  marisha im sorry  liam lets get the fuck out of here do a barrel roll  matt all right another giant arm swings but swings wide as it attempts to swing in the same  place it did before it does not seem to see the two of you quickly approach the proximity of its  torso you hear this zooming passing over you by about 30 or 40 feet  marisha /none/ oh trying to go for jmon  matt no trying to go where you guys were you still have a visual point on it so you direct and  tug vax by the hair and ears in the direction of the path you saw  marisha by the ponytail  matt yeah basically and there on the edge you can see jmon sa ord there wings flapping as you  guys rocket down and land right on the edge of the footsteps theres about a fivefoot gap where the  water isnt rushing past  marisha okay i immediately cast /none/ control water and suck it inside  matt okay the waterfall stops and bends upward and is now being held you guys have a row of  steps ahead of you that are safe enough to land on right now theyre still slick with water but  there isnt a rushing waterfall pouring over them  laura can we see where to go to an opening  matt you can see it ascends upward out of view  laura lets just go  taliesin this is whats happening this is who we are now  matt jmon they swoop down /none/ and the giant dragon claws clattering grapple onto the rock side of  this large titan and leans forward giving each of you the opportunity to jump a very short distance  over to these steps as each of you make this leap jmon disengages and flies up and says i  can only grant you so much for i have many to watch out here as we distract he who resides  above however take this as the dragon head descends you see the eyes flare with energy as  they cast mass cure wounds ooh two sixes and /none/ a seven not bad all right 12 19 thats going to  be 28 hit points healed to both of you  taliesin that helps  liam yeah as we were landing the gashes all over vaxs face started to heal up a little bit  but not all the way then suddenly they went even further  matt be safe and ill see you on the other side  laura fakecrying see you on the other side of the war  matt as you all stand on the precipice of this opening that falls off into a drop hundreds /dung/ of  feet to the rocky ground below you can smell the cold wind blowing through these caverns emerging  from this entrance youve found as keyleth holds back the flow of this river you glance up the  dark rising stairs deep into the body of the titan amongst the cursed vaults of this dwarven  city long abandoned and begin your trek to eventually meet your final conflict with the  whispered one thats where were going to end tonights game  extended cheering  brian keep it up  matt this is a little surreal  brian /none/ big time theres some people that we really want to thank really fast its
