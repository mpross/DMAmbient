heist version of critical role  dramatic music  marisha welcome back  sam serious serious  liam were bears  marisha where we last left off didnt happen so well jump right in  matt /none/ any rules to go over  marisha oh should i go over rules now  matt i figured that way we can go right into the narrative  marisha yeah where we last left off was rules  sam stop backseat dming  matt im trying to help its her first time ill shut up  marisha before we jump in honey heist is a super simple game everyone is a bear the bear has a  special skill well see that as we go along you will eventually be getting roles youre trying to  heist the mother lode /none/ of honey heists so you have two stats your bear stat and your criminal stat  you start the game with three points in each of the stats this is a d6based game so whenever  you do anything remotely bearrelated youre going to roll your bear stat you want to try and  get the number equal to or under how many points you have in bear criminal is anything basically  not related to being a bear thats quite literally actually what it says not to do  anything directly related to being a bear same thing equal /none/ to or under right if the plans  going well i can reward you with a point in criminal you move a point from bear over to the  stat conversely if you start getting a little aggravated or the plan starts not working out in  your favor you might move a point from criminal into bear the more frustrated you get if you  reach six points in either stat you either turn into an insane criminal mastermind betray the  party and decide to bounce or you go completely feral as a bear and cant really function /none/ being a  criminal anymore and youre out so you dont want that to happen  sam is there any other way to die like if you fall off something do you die what happens  marisha just dont jump off any cliffs is my recommendation  matt you get more frustrated from jumping off a cliff you become more bearlike cliffs cant  kill bears  marisha no its very cartoonish cartoon physics just dont look down if you decide to  walk off a cliff  brian do forest fires kill bears  matt no they dont thats /none/ why he has to keep telling us to fight them  marisha if you feel like youre starting to get a little too beary you can flash back to a  criminal planning sequence in order to move a point from bear into criminal if youre feeling a  little too shady you can eat a nice little snack of honey to move a point from criminal back into bear  liam do we have a batman belt with honey stashed on it  matt nope  liam we have to find it and eat it yeah  marisha thats /none/ what you guys are good at all right i think we get started  sam bear roar ease into it  marisha no wookiees hereby ban on wookiees  brian oh i should go  matt well no its my plan to die in the first half of the show  marisha this isnt the zombie apocalypse all right its autumn two years after the defeat of  the chroma conclave in westruun  sam wait were in westruun  marisha were in westruun  liam those fucking assholes  marisha the air has that perfect crisp breeze indicative of /town/ the chillier months to come the  scent of deepfried festival foods and fermented alcohols radiates heavily from the center of the  town square in the opal and market wards the distant sound of string quartets and laughing  townsfolk pick up in your ear trinket the immense sense recall spawns the memory in your  head and you know this is the happy food festival time this is your favorite time but for  some reason vex is walking you away from the festival and toward the bramblewood forest i  know buddy but listen i need you /town/ to stay here look i cant have you risking sneaking away and  giving in to your temptations again  matt sad bear growl  marisha pike would kill me and shes already upset at you for clearing out the slayers cake  honey stash the past two times i know but look i promise you if you do this for me buddy ill  come back with a whole load of festival treats all right all right darling okay be good  dont get into any trouble okay happy bear and she walks on down the road  matt /none/ where am i at right now  marisha you are currently on the edge of the bramblewood forest up on a mountain you can kind  of see westruun in the distance  matt so looking down at the city from a distance okay  marisha you can see far off that the city is dressed up in autumn colors and reds and there  are wagons being pulled into the city you recalled vex mentioning something about the  slayers cake competing in a competition seems like theyve got a lot of competitions they are  entering keyleth and /town/ pikes prize honey mmhmm so you know theres a lot of honey as you turn  around you hear a few cracks of branches theres a crowd of other bears seem to have been watching  the whole time theres a panda that waves  sam can we speak english  marisha yeah you can speak to each other you can kind of mumble through words to humans yeah

middle  taliesin worked his way from the bottom  brian started from the bottom now we at the middle man  taliesin top of it  marisha as you hear the music in the background press /none/ on all you can keep thinking about  trinket is that massive stash of honey hiding right behind the walls of the hazel festival  matt i look out do i still see vex or is she far enough away  marisha shes pretty far gone at this point over the mountain she doesnt seem to be paying  any attention to you  taliesin im going to try and sense honey  marisha okay roll a bear  taliesin double die  marisha you get

okay do we want to try and quickly and quietly make our way up behind  sam well what do we see  brian i would technically be the smallest correct being a honey badger rather than a bear  i could maybe if i need /none/ to slip by unnoticed to grab a couple of things and bring them back to you guys  liam thats right heres what were going to do okay cookie and waffle were going to fuck shit up  all

/none/ from this dank air passageway over in the corner but  your scent leads you in another direction and it jettisons to the left and it goes up to the  right and you see up in this attic loft a security room  taliesin oh theres a firewall  marisha and thats all you can see and it snaps you back into reality  taliesin theyve got a firewall i dont think they got me  brian dont take the hat

swinging wood sign says  sun kissed tavern with a sun rising up over top of the title  liam what about a /town/ side entrance to the security guard  marisha when you keep looking down the main road

marisha you open the door you look behind the guy unconscious on the floor are you going to do  anything with his body  sam im going to drag it inside and look for a place to stow it  brian does he have any keys on his body  taliesin use him to prop the door closed  marisha he does have keys on his body yes  brian can i take those keys  marisha you can /none/ take those keys  brian put them in the de rolo roller  marisha yeah okay  brian in case we want to go up  to the honeymoon suite  marisha this is literally just a stairwell entrance its very thin clearly there for service and  bringing in stock its a narrow little room there seems to be a cupboard under the stairs if  you want to stash him there  sam im going to grab him with my teeth  and try to shove him under the stairs  marisha theres a thin stairwell that goes /none/ up and opens up into a loft area theres one door that  looks like it was suite 1 and another door that looks like it was suite 2 where this was  liam get up there  marisha as you guys enter in you open the room you see four screens theyre all scrying mirrors  a few notes a few papers binoculars a few bottles of mead looks like buford  was having a good time  matt is it honey mead  marisha it is honey mead  taliesin all mead is honey mead  matt i /none/ know but im a bear so i have to clarify can i take one of the bottles  and drink it  marisha you do  matt gulping  marisha i would say you put a point back into bear from criminal you are a little tipsy  though for a little bit  matt slurred its fine were good  marisha i dont know how terrifying you might be for a little bit  matt oh you havent been around the right people and enough mead  brian this reminds me fellows of the time trinket got a little /tavern/ too drunk  when we were all out at  matt in this room  brian laughing i need a flashback really bad  sam we just met this guy an hour ago  brian well this reminds me of when my cousin blinket  sam who will also be portrayed by matthew mercer in the flashback sure  brian one time he also got really  i dont know why i went western all of a sudden  anyway flashback  liam he was a bush baby  matt im so drunk and your cousin  brian ah hes /tavern/ my cousin  matt im a cousin whos drunk  brian yeah anyway and sadly we had to take old blinket out back and shoot him because it turned  out he wasnt our cousin he was brought into town by the circus  marisha wow holy shit that definitely qualifies as a flashback to being a criminal get a point  back from bear to criminal youre good  taliesin i want to take a look at this weird security system that they have here with all these  mirrors are they viewing other rooms  marisha they are /town/ you look at one of them the first one is the town square the second one looks  like the entrance to the tavern you see a few people passed out drunk at tables and a lot of  action going on the other two theres codes in the corner it says scrycamslr1  wait clr1 and clr2 its not important  laughter  taliesin isnt it though isnt it kind of fucking important really  marisha theres town square tavern cellar room one cellar room two thats all you need  liam thats whats on these papers here  /none/ marisha thats whats blinking in the corner of each of these cameras mirrors scrying mirrors  taliesin i think i can hack these mirrors  marisha all right try to hack the mirrors  taliesin i want them to run a loop  marisha you want to throw them on a loop  taliesin i want to throw them on a loop  liam let the bear work let him do his thing  marisha thats pretty good all right hacker bear roll for hacking  taliesin im going to mime keyboarding  but in doing so its going to /tavern/ somehow  affect a magical spell  marisha sure  liam youve got this waffle  brian singing you came in like a hacker bear  taliesin yeah double two  marisha as youre hacking you get a waft of air from one of the vents off to the side and it  brings you back to the pipes in the tunnels and in your crackedout state you somehow connect to  the mainframe and it takes you through and you see the tavern and you see two people passed out  drunk and you go through into the first /none/ room and you see a few tripwires that seem to be strung out  across the long hallway and then you go into the last room and you see three pedestals with a  bunch of honey stacked onto these pedestals its very dimly lit but you recognize the shape of  fucking honey barrels  taliesin motherfucking honey barrels  liam barrels did you say barrels  taliesin we hit the mother lode  brian i dont know if i have room on the cart for all of this  marisha you go back and you see matrix code /town/  go in front of you and lights fly by  liam some people see zeros and ones  but all i see is honeybees and salmon  laughter  marisha you see a bunch of worker bees  in a hex pattern that looks codey  its a little green a little black like dos  taliesin im starting to believe  marisha the rest of you see waffle get a little nosebleed  matt waffle waffle  marisha as you snap back you look and you saw one guard walk by in the town square entrance  about /none/ 30 seconds same guard walks by  sam its on a loop  taliesin were clear  liam waffles going to fight sugarcone  marisha it seems through whatever magic that you have tapped into you have been a little touched  by the security cam security hacking  taliesin what wow this is insane  marisha you have to be able to see the honey  taliesin no i get it this will definitely not come in useful at all this is useless and dumb  and i cant wait to do it  marisha he comes back and /none/ waffles got a little gloss to his eyes a little bit of a green glow  crosses them  taliesin ready for an eggo waffle  ive upgraded to eggo  brian you look more belgian to me  liam you all right brother bear  taliesin never better  sam how do we get down there  or wherever weve got to go  taliesin that i cant tell you but i bought us some time  brian why is your voice so lame now  sam im sorry  matt laughs hey peddy which one of these rooms /tavern/ has the tree outside of it  sam it was the one on the left which is the first one that he went to the empty one  matt all right well follow vegas lead us to the tree well climb down and go around to the  inside of the tavern  marisha thats good because right as you walk out onto the balcony you see that guard who was  walking through that you captured on your loop start walking around going  hey boss boss you here  matt hey peddy take him out  sma where /none/ is he hes down below us  marisha hes walking under the balcony  looking like hes going to go around  that alleyway up to that door  liam peddy teabag that motherfucker  sam im muscle but im not aerodynamic  i climb up bamboo i dont  liam i boot him out the window  sam screams  marisha roll for criminal aim as you try to time pushing peddy tuxpin  liam come on dont fuck me one yeah  marisha you accurately with great precision teabag this poor guard and fall right on top of /none/  him hes not dead hes definitely unconscious though  taliesin the last thing he saw before going unconscious were panda testicles at full speed  as he screams  matt a giant tanuki flash  marisha he quite literally does not know  what hit him  brian next weeks wyrmwood giveaway is pandasack that is the new keyword  matt it is boom  brian write that down max  sam ugh i landed on my nuts  brian wasnt that the idea  matt good job peddy all right everyone  down the tree come on  /none/ liam another dose of high art  from critical role  taliesin thats the most useful panda testicles have been in a long time  im just going to point that out  marisha giggles you quickly and as swiftly as you can for a group of bears  climb down the tree and dart  and make your way into the front room  sam ive got my stick  what do you want me to do  matt make sure you dont leave it behind  might be handy  sam ive got it what do we do /tavern/ with this body someones going to see it  marisha you get the flyer get it in  you are now into the front tavern bar room  of the sun kissed inn  matt a valid point the body of the guy whos unconscious that he just crushed i pick up the  body and look for the window of the balcony we were just jumping down from and try and ragdoll  him up into it laughing arms and legs out  liam fullon red dead redemption  marisha bear i guess i dont know  brian thats /tavern/ totally something a bear would do flinging a man through a window  matt that was a six  liam his twisted pretzel body goes two miles floating five feet above the ground  marisha you miss and it goes and lands on the roof of the storage room next door  matt close enough  laughter  marisha its not the most immediately visible thing  taliesin no one looks up  matt its fine sweet dreams goes back to catch up with them in the tavern  brian he wont remember that  marisha you all are in /tavern/ the front room of the tavern its the late afternoon theres no one in  the tavern anyway especially now theres one really old guy passed out in the front righthand  corner seems like hes been there probably since last night you hear a commotion and clanking of  pots and pans of chefs and workers in the back in the kitchen getting things ready for the evening  anticipating it will probably be a busy day in the hazel festival  taliesin do i smell honey in the kitchen  marisha yeah  sam theres honey everywhere in /town/ this town  marisha there is honey in there  matt you with the strange crazy eyes  do you have any idea where the cellar is  here in the inn  marisha it is drowned out by the smell of a stockroom of honey that is coming from the back  lefthand corner of the tavern which is the entrance to the pantry into the cellar guarding  that front initial doorway into the pantry which leads into the bottom cellar is with a pint in  his hand a passedout grog  sam grog strongjaw  marisha /none/ grog  taliesin the grog strongjaw of the northampton strongjaws i dont know why i went there  marisha the herd technically of the emon strongjaws  liam if one of us bears made a history check would we know who the fuck this guy is  taliesin he looks big  marisha trinket recognizes him immediately  sam i think i can excuse me this is clearly a panda bear hes a skinnier version of me  hes black and white and i will go talk to him  in panda and i will sort this all out  /tavern/ matt while youre both probably on par intellectually i dont know  if thats going to end as  sam hes furry hes got a little fur hes black and white hes my people  matt is he right in front of the door to the pantry  marisha theres the bar theres a door that goes into the pantry and then theres a little booth  and bar tables right off to the left of the door looks like he was placed there probably told to  watch out for people coming in and out of the pantry and /tavern/ proceeded to drink a lot and pass out  instead hes in a little chair propped up at a bar table right to the left of the entrance  snoring loudly no what  brian theres cards  marisha cards oh  matt were going to keep this as plan c  plan a quietly make our way past  taliesin quick question which plan comes first is it plan a or plan c  matt brains  liam im going to roll a d6 and ill tell you plan d comes first  taliesin that makes sense  sam /none/ why does no one value my opinions here i feel like im offering good ideas  brian when we need you to push something over  to dip your balls in something  sam i feel like im thinking outside the box here and no ones taking me seriously  liam peddy you dont make friends with salad  no offense trinket this is your home turf  i will follow your lead  taliesin i dont know what that means  marisha i dont either  brian vegetarian joke  liam hes a vegetarian all he eats is bamboo /tavern/  no ones going to respect that  in the bear community  brian while theyre doing this i would like to go right outside the tavern and see if i can  secure for us a getaway vehicle some type of mode of transportation faster than a de rolo roller  marisha sure as you peek out theres a few abandoned vegetable carts people that were there  to sell their goods and their wares for the festival theres one that looks like it was a  pullbehind churro cart and there is one cart that still has a /tavern/ horse attached to it that looks  like at this point hes eating all of the vegetables that are completely unattended  right now due to the pandemonium  brian so theres no one around it  i will go secure that cart and bring it  to the entrance of the tavern  marisha okay how would you like to do that  brian am i still dressed up as a fucking awesomelooking guy  like a young jason charles miller  marisha yeah you totally look like a young jason charles miller  taliesin does that mean that /none/ a young  jason charles miller looks like a honey badger  in a cowboy hat  brian it sure does  liam im picturing a furry great american hero  brian yes so i will cross the thoroughfare as suavely and slovenly as i can and then i will  approach the cart from the back so as not to frighten the horse  marisha okay you see the same guard that was walking by is currently pounding on the door  you can hear him on the door that you guys came from that led up to the /none/ security room you can  hear him going chief boss man hello  brian how far away from me is he  marisha the guy hes far enough away hes not paying any attention to you right now  brian does it look like he wants to go in there  marisha hes trying to get in yeah  brian all

theatrical amount of blood sprays on the door in front and he slowly drops smears  down against the wall hes dead  brian oh shit hes dead  marisha hes definitely dead  brian on the wall in the blood i write  welcome to fabulous las vegas  laughter  marisha roll for criminal  /none/ brian again success  marisha you get a point from bear into criminal for sure  liam my criminal mastermind brain tells

trinket giant  bear paws try and /none/ maneuver these tiny little  liam thin as a blade of grass  matt its like trying to hold a cup with boxing gloves on grunts  marisha countless hours you have practiced in the middle of the night just trying to learn how  to pick a lock prove to us trinket  that you can  matt yes  marisha clang the whole thing snaps from the inside because youre a bear but

supersecret society that is dedicated  to protecting bears all across taldorei  one of the most decorated members  its called the high bear nation all right  its not bad right  we take honey and other fruits and vegetables steal them from people who dont really need them  and make sure that bear families  across all of taldorei are taken care of  and never go without honey  every year this stupid hazel festival that they always make me /none/ work security for i decided  im going to take all this leftover food  that all these people always end up with  im going to take it for high bear nation  give it to the bears who truly need it  sam wait a second youre going to take all this honey and give it away  brian give it away to a bunch of people that are too lazy to get jobs  liam dont we look

far the whole towns out looking  for you i can easily call one of the guards  turn you all in right now or you help me out  i could use extra hands to carry out  some of this honey  youll get your own little cut and youll all  become members of the high bear nation  sam what kind of cut are you talking about here  marisha enough to last you for a while i know how much honey is in there  sam 5050

meal i dont think she understands how hungry we are  brian yeah and that ones big  matt that one only eats bamboo  brian yeah but should he switch and start to /none/ eat honey he could consume much of it  sam i dont really care about the honey one way or the other honestly im fine just eating  bamboo but i do feel like we put in the effort this is our heist its not hers if she wants  to get cut in we could give her maybe  a thousand percent i dont know numbers  but a small amount  matt i could always say theres five of us  and one of her  if she helps us make our way in there  brian i /none/ cut her throat  matt trust me ive seen a lot of battles  and i havent fallen in a single one  laughter  matt we can take her no problem we leave her tied up leave her a little hogshead of honey she  can take back to her bear friends and then we walk away scotfree  sam as a vegan im going to protest that we not harm any living creatures  matt not harm just knock unconscious and tie up like youve done to every other thing  weve come across  sam thats okay /none/ that is not harm  but heavens forbid we actually  kill a human being on this adventure  matt oh god no unless theyre evil or an asshole or hurt my mom  brian i did kill a human person though  sam can you flash us back to that incident  brian well it was 24 minutes ago and i slit  the throat of an innocent douchebag  who was knocking too loud  sam why would you kill an innocent person  brian he nearly discovered all of you and i killed him  sam i /none/ cant believe you youre heartless  brian i do what it takes everything

though anyone good at disarming yeah well figure it out when we  get in lets go you throw open the door and see a long hallway three haphazardly across the  hall tripwires theyre long cylindrical glowing a bit green you take a little bit of  dust liam las vegas and they show up a little bit better then they go back to their dull  transparent look like fishing wire  brian i dont like this one bit  matt /none/ does this look like the kind of thing that a thieftrained bear who has seen thieves do their  work would have an inkling of how to disable it  marisha you can certainly try  brian that sounds so familiar  marisha i tried to think up bear puns  for all of our sayings and i couldnt find  any natural ones  matt the internet will barrage us with them when were done  brian theres going to be a lot yeah  taliesin there will be nothing on twitter other than bear puns  matt i /none/ go back into the bag of thieves tools left over from vex and pull out what i think might  work i take a look at the mechanisms for the trip wire two and a one  marisha nice okay you go up to the first one and you see an energy box off to the side its  got a washer keeping it closed you tilt that to the side see the mechanical mechanism  on the inside pop  matt i turn around with a big goofy smile  marisha you got through tripwire one two more to /none/ go  liam arcane magic dispelled  matt

big mystery wheres the mystery mysterious yeah thats  good behind the door you see a dimly lit /tavern/ cellar room a waft of cool air blasts by you you see a  few bar tables that have been tossed over clearly left in here for storage a few bags of  grain and in the middle on discarded bar tables there are three tables the first one has  a little note that says slayers cake its got a nice couple of small halfbarrels of honey the  second one says reginalds daughter whatever her name is has a note  matt it might have been amelia  marisha i think it was something like that ariana whatever /none/ third one  matt the writing isnt very good the name begins with an a and then scribbles  marisha in scribbled red lettering says victor and theres so much honey in actual boar  heads thats oozing out somes dripping off the side of the table and then you follow the drip  down and see more hogs heads goat heads you see a bear head pretty much looks like any type of head  he could find he got it and put gray ichory sulfuricsmelling honey  you see four torch sconces on the walls lightly puttering you /town/ follow and you see holy shit  victor brought way too much fucking honey and the entire edge of the cellar room is filled with  weird heads of honey  liam waffle this is it this is our fathers dream  taliesin everything weve worked for  liam we have reached easy street  taliesin its all honey from here on out  just honey everything  matt how are those sconces looking  marisha precarious  matt whats in them is it magical light  marisha nope it looks like torch sconces that they dipped in kerosene a /none/ longburning torch  they probably lit them when they were bringing in the honey and then walked out  matt do any of them look viably close to dropping embers  marisha there is one thats right over the table of victors that looks like its a miracle it  hasnt honestly exploded yet  taliesin lets grab the honey and run  brian ive got a cart outside waiting with a horse and everything  matt code sad bear weve got to move now  taliesin im grabbing honey  brian is tova still with us  marisha tova /none/ is she sees the same thing shes a little confused as to why

/none/ down the opposite hallway away from this room  marisha okay lets go and she starts scooping up honey and throwing them into the radio flyer  de rolo roller  brian blahblahblah  matt actually while this is happening i reach over and go hey cookie if i buy you a new hat  could i borrow yours  liam fuck yeah  brian singing if you want to see paradise  matt im going to take the top hat and place it just over the heavy collection of victors honey  beneath where the sconce is  marisha /none/ okay are you still wearing the sunglasses peddy  sam of course  marisha you get a little bit of an advantage because at this time you look up and you see  through the roof of the cellar very quick shadowed movement  sam someones above us  taliesin wed better move im going to create  a distraction

she goes  shit its the bearracuda  brian theyre not with you  groaning  matt i immediately glance around they came through the ceiling are there any of the sconces  that look close to being  marisha yes theres one on the left closest to the door fractured and got knocked over by one of  the splintering floorboards and is now swinging above all of the honey  matt we /none/ cant and i point to the ninja bears coming our way and the ones that just entered  handle it and i go for the swinging sconce board to see if i can clap it out with my bear paws and  put out the flame  marisha okay roll for bear  brian am i able to get the cart of honey  matt nope  marisha unfortunately as you try to stamp it out with the board the other floorboard catches on  fire and now you have two flame sources

load the honey  into the cart  matt knowing that upstairs is grog two people that weve knocked out another drunk guy /tavern/ whos  passed out in the bar and god knows whos nearby and the amount of victor honey thats in here im  focusing on trying to put the fires out  marisha okay roll again  sam are you going to pee on the fire  matt yeah im one of the few that hasnt peed so i probably have a

spiraling arc of flammable honey that goes everywhere you do hit one of the ninjas  with a decent amount of honey  gets a little disoriented  backs into one of the torch sconches  sconces lights on fire  taliesin weve got /none/ to roll kids  marisha yelping he backs up trips blinded by the fire falls onto the ground the fire starts  following the spilled honey and then suddenly everyone time

liam but she just got pulled through the door  marisha she got pulled through the door  liam i say i hear my fathers voice in the morning and i dive at the remaining bearracuda  and plow /none/ them

head go i hope youre within /none/ about a hundred feet  of me wherever you are vex  marisha you are jettisoned with the cellar door an exploding round of fire  comes barreling down the hall burning
