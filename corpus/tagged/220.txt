dung	 living room  sam maybe if they can find the living room its dark  taliesin just hear the sound of a wine aerator in the background  sam oh yeah they have their wine aerator they each have their cell phones theyre okay  laughter  sam they aerate their milk  matt that would be the worst sound bubbling milk sound anyway thats enough of that  guys anyway thats the end of our announcements and as such  that brings us to tonights episode of  critical role  music  matt hello everyone and welcome back 
none	 to critical role hope you liked our new intro apparently i  guess theyre having some tech issues trying to get the regular intro showing tonight little  change for the evening no biggie mix it up a little bit anyway so last we left off vox  machina after discovering that the various siphon orbs the one that was beneath whitestone was one  of many and apparently were funneling magical energies from various arcane ley lines that exist  across exandria into some plane other than the prime material  through research and discovery you found that this 
town	 plane was the shadowfell upon traversing  this barrier and dealing with some cultists of the whispered one you discovered that delilah  briarwood was still alive and that there was a city in the shadowfell beyond the boundary of these  siphons known as thar amphala an ancient city that had seen an ancient battle but much had been  rebuilt and constructed there in the center of the town was the dark tower called entropis  where apparently the whispered one vecna or something involved in a ritual was being  completed you began to make your way 
none	 through this city averting any sort of attention from most of  the denizens in the sky and below you squashed heads of a few cultists on the way masqueraded as  cultists masqueraded as undead found the city itself shift strangely using technology of the  threshold crests that syngorn uses it transported itself out of the shadowfell and somewhere else  where it began to snow you made your way to the central tower and deciding not to ascend it took  it to the ground with some earthquake spells however due to the magical defenses of the 
none	 tower  top where the rituals were being completed it seems the top of the tower was untouched by the  spells and lowered itself to the rubble of where it once stood you then mustered your forces rode  up to the top of the lip of what remains of entropis and joined in battle against delilah  briarwood a death knight and the physical form of vecna the whispered one himself however the  battle did not turn in your favor and in the process of the battle  travis thats debatable  laura is it  matt 
none	 in some degrees  whether through bad luck or  not fully understanding the scope of what you were up against a number of  you fell in battle with one of them not being able to be restored being vaxildan who was  reduced to dust by a disintegration spell realizing that your fortunes were failing with  grog banished to another dimension and only barely returning in time you joined hands and keyleth  attempted to travel you out of the plane to safety of which vecna attempted to stop with a  counterspell and scanlan attempted to 
none	 stop that counterspell with his own counterspell like a  bard is wont to do so you successfully transported grabbing the corpse of delilah  briarwood who percival finished off with a shot to the head you found yourselves last we left  off emerging deep into a wooded forest in some unknown location within the feywild upon  arriving and glancing about to see that youre still mostly intact clutching the  nolongerliving corpse of delilah behind you vax not with you  and vex realizing asked the question  laura wheres vax  sam i walk up to 
none	 her and i set down his armor and dont say anything  laura whats this where is he  sam theres nothing left he was obliterated  marisha disintegrated  laura what  marisha i saw it happen and then i saw it happen  laura and we just left him there  marisha no we brought  taliesin we brought everything we could  laura oh god no  taliesin im so sorry  laura i was brought back and his soul is just where  marisha thats the ultimate question isnt it  laura can you bring him 
none	 back  ashley i dont know if i can  taliesin can you keyleth  marisha ive never done this before  laura i go over and gather up all of his armor and start hugging it to myself  marisha i recently learned a spell that i could attempt but its nothing ive tried before and  its expensive and im already terrified of the fate and the hell that i might have brought him in  his final moments  travis well what is it  marisha i think he saw himself die i think im so sorry 
none	  laura what are you talking about  marisha i cast foresight on him and i think there was a thing for a second i havent thought  of those ramifications of something like that before i think he was held and there was nothing  he could do what if that happened what if he saw himself die  taliesin then it doesnt matter yet until we bring him back  travis only matters what we do next right  taliesin lets bring him back  travis whats this new spell you were talking about  marisha i need 
none	 25000 gold pieces worth of diamonds  travis what  marisha i need 25  laura not just gold you need diamonds  taliesin where are we  laura i dont have i dont have that  marisha were in the feywild  taliesin we can find it then  matt as you look around at this point for the first time really taking in the surroundings  around you you find yourself deep in a shaded thick wood where most of the leaves here are wide  and triangular in shape where you expect to see deep greens instead 
none	 you see blues and purples  you see the tips eventually coming to a midnight blue at the edge theres a very faint mist that  has gathered across the ground that stands about kneeheight the ground beneath you seems to have  a somewhat crunchy sponginess to it with each step though you cannot see where your feet  actually touch the ground  sam is it all diamonds  matt it is not all diamonds you do hear the everpresent echoing distant hooting of owls  owl hooting  taliesin well now we know what to do we 
none	 were too late and we have seen what were up against  and now we need to focus we cant let it be over yet we need to focus  were going to find these diamonds  laura was it her or was it vecna  sam it  taliesin grog can you put her in the bag and i toss him the body  matt as the body of delilah briarwood the head still scattered and divided right around the  forehead this giant cleft of her skull hemisphere is gone whatever matter was once there has loosely  
none	 fallen out as shes been dragged from one location you do see the left eye which is not  human it seems in appearance the white is instead a sickly greenishyellow and the pupil is a  catlike slit of black surrounded by a thin greenishblue tint as soon as you look down and  see the face the eye which just looks upward at nothing the dead body still the eye twitches and  shifts to look at you  travis oh unhappy humming her fucking eye is still moving  ashley should we take it out  sam 
none	 yes it could be vecna watching us  travis does it look reptilian  laura can you put it in a bag or something cover it up  sam wait can i take a closer look at it and see if i can i dont know identify it somehow  matt do you have an identify spell  sam no but can i just see  matt make an arcana check  sam sure two plus five  matt as you get down close to glance at the rather disturbingly bloodied face of delilah  briarwood the eye shifts back 
none	 towards you the closer you get you watch as the thinning slit of  the pupil seems to widen and focus on you its an unsettling presence as you try and concentrate to  see if theres any immediate signs of whether it be sigils or arcane marks that would mark it to be  more of a magically enchanted object than an actual organic eye nothing comes to mind other  than the fact that it seems to be very intent on studying you back  sam can i try to remove it from the ocular cavity  matt 
none	 using your fingers  sam yeah my tiny ocular hands  matt okay go ahead and make an athletics check  sam nine  matt okay you slurping  sam i can inspire myself i suppose  matt if you want to up to you how many more bardic inspirations do you have after the battle  sam two right i didnt cutting words anyone those count as inspiration right  matt yeah your fingers are now knuckledeep in delilah briarwoods socket  sam ill inspire myself just to give it a serious try thats plus ten so thats a 
dung	 19 plus i  guess three for jack of all trades  matt if youre not trained in it then yeah  sam 22  matt you begin humming your favorite eyepulling song under your breath and with a horrible sucking  sound you pull the eye from her socket leaving this trail of dark black and red viscera that  dangles from it loosely as you pull it free whatever attached the eye to it seems to burn off  and fall leaving just the circular socket i also need you to roll a wisdom saving throw  sam 
none	 oh no instadeath  travis youre fine  sam no im not oh is this magic  matt its not a magic spell id say its a magic effect yeah  sam do i get advantage  matt ill say as a gnome for this yes you would  sam way better but still terrible 12  laura how bad was your first one  sam a one  matt so you watch as scanlan pulls this eye out and looks at it for a second for you its less  of an actual voice but these images come to 
none	 your mind of all the terrible things that have happened  in your life the loss of your mother the nearloss of kaylie the loss of your friends  every person thats ever mattered to you youve seen slain before you or heard about you could  stop that from ever happening again all the answers you could have you would have the power  to prevent any of that from ever happening again and its so simple its so simple  laura could we smack the eye out of his hand  matt as this is happening you watch 
none	 as hes looking at it and this hand goes up and starts  clawing into his own eye socket  taliesin im going to use every dex i have im going to slap fucking hard  matt dex isnt going to help you so much as its going to be a strength thing go ahead and make an  athletics check for you for this this would be an acrobatics to try and dodge out of the way  taliesin strength check  matt athletics  taliesin oh athletics thats better  matt youre trying to slap it out of 
none	 his grasp  sam 13  taliesin 10  matt you slap and the hand pulls back a little bit and he yanks it back you can see a trail of  blood beginning to pool out of the corner of the eye  ashley can i try to grab his hand and slap him across the face  matt yeah this is the last chance anybody has to try and do this or scanlan loses an eye were  going into event horizon moment here go ahead and make an athletics check  ashley 27  matt roll an 
none	 acrobatics check  sam its the same thing so its 13  matt as his fingers are digging into the socket and the other eyes just staring at this piercing  circular gaze in his grasp in his right you see the blood beginning to trail down his face in two  different places hes gotten his fingers partway behind his own eye you rush up and grab him by  the wrist put your other hand right at the front of his face pushing his nose and cheek up you  pull it back and you watch as from 
none	 behind the eyelid his fingers slip out hes fighting it  with all his might as you pull back as soon as you get it free with your other hand you  backhand you knock the eye out of his other hand and it goes falling noise  and disappears beneath the mist  laura can we see where it landed  taliesin yeah im going to follow the eye  marisha do not touch it percy  sam can i see  matt the throbbing pain and youre not able to focus in this eye at the time youre 
none	 effectively  unable to see out of this eye really well until your next long rest its pretty damaged just from  the brief grabbing you could try to heal him if you want your mind comes back to you for a  minute youre like what the fuck is wrong with me  travis what were you doing  sam it was speaking to me  ashley what did it say  sam i dont exactly remember but it had some really strong arguments  travis was it telling you to pull your own fucking eye out  sam 
none	 i guess yeah it was offering me things it was telling me it could help ive never felt that  way before it was amazing  travis ew where did it go  matt you said you were going to look in the mist for it  laura no im not just holding onto  matt the remains of vax  marisha keyleth goes over to vex and curls up into her  matt 14 as you dive over in the direction of where you think you saw it go the mist is thick  and you start pushing it 
none	 away and there is very dense underbrush and foliage that is gathered here  that created the crunchy floor glancing through and pushing around theres no sign of the eye  taliesin i need help finding it i need help be very careful  travis i come over and start helping him look  taliesin ive got the flashlight box out and im going to try  and use this as a container if we find it  matt okay youre not using the actual light youre using the box the thickness in the mist  right now the light 
none	 would probably hinder your search than help it  taliesin keyleth can you thin this we need to see make the mist go away  marisha what  taliesin louder can you make the mist go away  marisha i dont know  sam can you try  marisha i halfheartedly do a gust cantrip while still sitting next to vex  matt you watch as some of the mist dissipates and very quickly begins to roll back the mist here is  almost aggressive in its need to fill the space like a lot of things in the feywild 
none	 it almost has  its own sense of nature and purpose its not going to let someone push itself back if it wishes  to exist on the forest floor as youre rushing in to help because youve already made the  investigation check and the mist is rolling in and based on his inability to find it youre not  even quite sure where it landed make your own investigation check but youre at disadvantage  travis okay hey thats high thats not three  matt okay over the next three or four minutes as you guys pat through 
dung	 and tear roots apart and  sections of the forest floor there is no sign of where the eye landed  ashley if i were to cast locate object would that work  matt you can certainly try  ashley okay  matt you go over and grab your holy symbol and kneel to the ground focus on whatever this dark  relic is that seems to have plagued you in two different ways in the past ten minutes as you  concentrate you feel the divine light of sarenrae come and restore warmth from the center of this  
none	 cold forest you feel the energy flow through you and the image of her face descending from  above her mouth opening and she exhales this breath over you and as it does you suddenly can  clarify your visual perception on this object you know exactly the direction it is you start  walking in that direction you push past grog and push past percival you find a portion of the  ground and you look and its not there but you know its that direction  ashley i think ive located it i cant see it but i 
none	 know what direction its in  sam is it beneath the ground is it invisible  ashley i dont know so it seems like its in the ground or its been moved  matt trying to push aside the mist in the area and its all closed in now the gust cantrip held  back what it could while you cast the spell  marisha i seem them moving in that direction and once again poof for them  matt the mist separates again you look and you can see the direction where it would be and as  you 
none	 glance over and focus your attention it looks like between two of the roots theres a portion  of fresh dirt  sam it burrowed  ashley okay can i start digging  matt you start scooping in  taliesin i have the box out ready  matt about three inches down you scoop down and pull up a big handful of moist dirt and then  there you watch as some of it falls away you see the wet exterior of the greenishyellow eyeball  it began to burrow you see it glancing about the eye is flickering around 
none	 like its rapidly trying  to find a way out  ashley i put it in the box  matt you close the box  sam i dont trust that thing  taliesin the burrowing eyeball are you sure  laughter  travis holy shit  sam i mean i dont trust it near us  ashley thats my favorite thing youve ever said  sam percy i think you need to give it to me to hold  taliesin i think thats a terrible idea  sam no i can take care of it better than you  taliesin 
none	 what makes you think that  sam just give it to me trust me  taliesin youre bleeding out your eye right now  sam i want revenge on this eye give it to me so i can get revenge  ashley hold on i cast cure wounds for his eye  matt yeah the eye wasnt removed from the socket but the damage that was around it seems to  have healed up from the mild cure wounds theres still the drying blood that has pooled down the  cheek but it appears that most of the initial damage 
none	 has been sealed  ashley do you want me to hold it  taliesin i kind of want you to hold it  sam i think i should hold it  ashley i feel like im going to hold onto it in case it tries to attach itself to you again and  you pull out your eyeball again  taliesin yes and that thing should be difficult to get out of it it is a big case  sam what if it can still hear us sense where we are  travis its an eyeball it doesnt have ears 
none	  sam that is true that is a very good point  taliesin well if were really amused by it we just set off the light crystal thats in there and  let it blind itself in there for a while that would be funny we have bigger problems diamonds  and delilah  travis oh yeah she still goes in the bag right  taliesin oh yeah were going to want to have a word with her later  marisha even beyond the diamonds  taliesin vex vex he needs you here now i need you here were not 
none	 done this is not over  yet we are in trouble we need to find a city the two of you i need both of you here  laura of course darling  marisha this was supposed to be a weekend trip  taliesin nothing is ever what its supposed to be  marisha just a weekend trip  taliesin i know lets get this done  marisha even after we find 25000 gold pieces worth of diamonds ive never brought anyone back  before and this is versus the raven queen how do we know if his soul is 
none	 even available for return  taliesin how do we know that she is against us this was vecna she may still be with us  laura i cant believe i left his soul over there alone  ashley we didnt  laura i did i came back  taliesin were not done  marisha maybe we should talk to the raven queen  travis how do you do that  laura theres a temple in vasselheim and theres a temple in whitestone  marisha same way that he did  taliesin we need to find diamonds can we find them 
none	 while were here  can we find them where we are  laura i dont know how you find diamonds in the feywild  travis percy dont you know the feywild  taliesin where are we  travis do we see any structures off in the distance or is it all just overgrowth  matt you are in the center or at least completely surrounded by enclosed dense  bluishpurple forest you cannot see above the canopy what little bit of light is visible seems  to be from a bioluminescence beneath the fog as you pushed below you could 
none	 see what appeared to  be bits of fungus that grew out of the forest floor the slowly dying off and decomposing leaves  and fallen branches its almost like this underlit glow but you dont see any structures  no signs of civilization you have no idea where you are  youve not been to this part of the feywild  marisha maybe our werewolf friends are still around  travis yeah i was going to say i have a terrible idea i think they wanted to leave so what if  they know of some hidden treasure trove 
none	 around here that could you know tit for tit  laura i might be able to buy diamonds as well if we go to a city  sam if we rest i may be able to make them  laura 25000 gold worth of diamonds  sam how big is that  laura it could be a lot of smaller diamonds  sam but how big how many  laura ill pull out one diamond that i have thats worth 1500 gold  taliesin i feel within a tinker theory is how figuring out how much diamonds  laura we 
none	 would need 20 more of these  matt it can range based on the purity of the diamond how well its been cut you can make an  intelligence check if youd like  taliesin thatll do i feel like this would be in the wheelhouse  laura i have to blow my nose again  taliesin god i am rolling just the worst 13  matt 13 i mean thats a lot of diamonds that can range depending on the purity and where in  the world theyre found theres a standard amount when it comes to magic practices 
none	 that arent  tailored to the cultural variations of cost you couldnt ask somebody sell me these diamonds  but for six times the cost you know it wouldnt help the spell occur thats the general  equivalent to the amount of diamonds that are consumed required for his spell youve never seen  that many diamonds in one place  marisha we dont have a body so were basically making a diamond vax  taliesin i know where there are diamonds  laura where  sam i can make them we just need an animal  ashley how much 
none	 can you make  sam as much as the animal  travis ooh the bigger the animal the bigger the diamonds  marisha i can make animals  sam i mean i know youre grieving but we could give trinket up for this  marisha i can make animals  laura scanlan  sam it was worth a try  laura youre such a shithead  taliesin there is a second thought if this does not go well which was there was one place where  we saw that many diamonds in one place before thordak  travis surely theyve 
dung	 cleaned all that up by now right  taliesin yes but not everything left the city theres enough there it didnt get randomly  distributed im sure that they have it and im sure that we can make a deal  travis take a loan  taliesin i have something worth money  travis was it a bad idea  sam taking out a loan  travis yeah  sam to buy diamonds  laura we have gold we have plenty of gold  marisha what did kraghammer mine what was their deal  matt all sorts of things many 
dung	 precious metals gems stone that was used for crafting hewing  into various forms of masonry anything that could be reaped from beneath the cliffkeep mountains  thats what kraghammer specialized in  marisha what if we go to a mine we could go straight to a source buy direct  laura we could go to kraghammer and buy or we could try doing what scanlan said  sam we could try mine first and if it doesnt work but i need to rest  i cant do anything today  laura should we get back to our world  
none	 taliesin we go to kraghammer rest there  marisha we cant we have to sleep before unless theres a portal nearby that we can get through  laura did you send us to the pond i thought you took us to the pond  marisha it has to be nearby plane shift is general i pick an area and it gambles where its  going to drop us  matt and did you specify the location  marisha i did i said the shademirk bog and the pond the glade i found the page in my notes and  rambled 
none	 all the names off very quickly in a panic  matt whats interesting when last you were in the shademirk you recall this being a very  oilthickened forest  laura oh you took us to where saundor was you didnt take us to the pond with the chick  matt correct this is the shademirk this is where you battled with saundor however the  forest youre in now if this is indeed the same location it seems to have vastly recovered from  the corruption that saundors presence gave which is why its both unfamiliar to you and 
none	 not as  oppressive as the last time you visited  marisha didnt we nope i plane shifted us out  laura we have to spend the night here vecnas in our world  taliesin vecnas in a box  laura how much power does he get from that eye  taliesin more than all of us combined id imagine  travis if it burrows in the ground it cant break out of the box right  taliesin i dont know  laura open the box and see what its doing  taliesin we can look in the box without 
none	  sam give it to me ill take care of it ill send it away to a place where only i can get it  ashley can i take a peek  matt yeah you open it up you hold it back and hold the door open  taliesin theres a glass thing so we can look through the glass  matt immediately glancing in you see it staring right back at you  marisha horrified wail  laura dont send it to another plane thats very fucking weird  sam but its a personal plane its my plane  
none	 laura are you sure nobody else can ever get into it  sam i am not  laura then no  sam i dont know how this works my daughter taught me this spell ive never used it before  laura then fuck it were not doing it  sam it goes into a little pocket dimension is what she told me  i dont even know what that means  laura thats really weird  taliesin what if its the vecna dimension  sam here lets try something just give me something ill send it there now i dont 
none	 know  what thatll do  ashley how will we know its there  sam give me trinket  laura no stop it  sam i cant do trinket it has to be less than five pounds  travis less than five pounds  sam yes  ashley it has to be something small  sam yeah  marisha no no dont consider it pike no  sam give me anything  travis do you want a pair of manacles  sam sure  travis heres a pair of manacles  sam all right i will use wrist pocket  
none	 matt you watch as he holds the manacles and does a flourish with his hand  and they vanish from sight  ashley how do you know if theyre there  sam i dont know where they are i literally have no idea but watch this  matt they seem to apparate immediately into his grasp  sam i dont know how i even do that  laura cool were not using a randomass magic trick on an eyeball  ashley did you just point at me and tell me to come to you so you can  make me 
none	 disappear and come back  sam no the eye i can get rid of the eye  ashley no it makes me nervous scanlan i want to keep our eyes on it  laughter  ashley fuck off  sam maybe we should vote on this should we give it to me who says aye  taliesin you can buy my vote  sam i dont have that much  taliesin yes you do you can buy my vote  sam i dont have enough  laura are there any animals around  matt make a nature check  laura 
none	 natural 20  matt youre familiar with forests definitely and you can see telltale signs of scurrying  telltale signs of track marks in the ground feces left behind by living creatures you do see signs  of things that live throughout these forests everywhere  laura anything that looks like it would be the size of an adult deer or something  travis doe a deer a female deer  laura im thinking a male deer yes a stag a white stag any stag really  just an animal thats big  matt you see a number of tracks 
none	 that would resemble creatures of that size or larger some  seem bearlike some seem larger than that though similar claws and heavy footprints some that are  smaller and skittery you see there was a small cluster of what might be deerlike creatures but youre not  quite sure what the tracks are theres plenty of life that wanders through here apparently since  youve arrived none that seem bold enough to approach you too closely in this clustered  clearing youre in cant even call it a clearing because you maybe have a total of ten feet youre 
none	  all crammed into at this time  travis if we howl right  ashley are we down  laura yeah we havent healed since  taliesin we are wrecked  ashley hows everybody doing  laura im low  sam arent you low pike like 11 or something  laura i mean were about to rest youre probably super low  ashley i think am lets see if i wrote it down here oh yeah i forgot im almost dead  laura trinkets unconscious still in my necklace  ashley okay  laura hes unconscious i pop him out

none	 you made earlier there is i dont want to  say not a kinship but a sense of understanding between you and the surrounding forest its hard  to explain and you havent really had this sense before this is more a keyleth territory of having  this connection with nature but its because you wield fenthras and were responsible in a large way  for cleansing this landscape that as you begin to approach and look for trees for a place to sleep  you watch as one tree the branches seem to bend down to form a small 
none	 ladder you watch as the  boughs above separate and create an easytolaydown cluster of branches and leaves  taliesin small miracles  marisha they like us now  laura thank you  travis you guys crash ill take first watch  laura im going to pull the armor up so we can keep it did you want  marisha yeah we cuddle between the armor  taliesin thats weird im not getting into it  marisha thats the saddest thing  matt thats pretty sad all right the rest of you find yourselves to a nights rest seemingly

none	 whole new show  liam spinoff  matt all right were getting liam back in here shoo no well probably have you back in  getting tangled  marisha dont die forever  matt well wait for them to leave the room  vaxildan as your eyes dart back and forth  glancing upward at the sky above snow hitting and stinging your paralyzed eyes you see the terrible  lich above you a flash of green then darkness floating without weight without temperature you  glance around in the surrounding shadow and cannot see anything your hands before you 
dung	 nothing it  is just void darkness you will yourself to see something anything and in an instant you begin  to glow your form becomes visible around you you can now see your body nude and held aloft in this  dark space emanating this soft vibrant orangishwhite light  as the light begins to emanate and cast away the darkness you also see what appears to be a  tangling of some sort of web strands of silk that also begin to glow with a similar light as to your  form that holds you tightly in your 
dung	 position you struggle but youre held firm you think you yell  out but as you glance upward to shout for help you see the shadows now curl back to reveal the  familiar sight of a massive white porcelain womans face eyeless yet staring straight at if  not through you her presence imposing as it may be soothes you as her giant hand larger than a  house a palace it seems almost emerges from below and gives you a ground to step on your feet  finding purchase in the center of her dark palm  as 
none	 your feet touch her palm the silk web seems to loosen you cast off the threads and fall to your  hands and knees you take a moment and you hear that soft voice once more my champion you  return to me and tear a swath through the tapestry please be calm my sight can pierce  many veils but youve been hidden from my sight in recent days and i am worried what foulness has  turned its intent upon us now here you come to me your very thread frayed and soul  transitioning an unexpected destiny 
none	 for my beautiful fatetouched one of her fingers curls  through your hair at the back of your head tell me what you have seen  liam your enemy  matt i have many enemies  liam vecna  matt what does this vecna intend  liam hes come hes come back to our world my home my family is in danger  the world is in danger  matt how so how can one man be this dangerous what does he intend what have you learned  liam i dont know  matt i wonder why he guards my 
none	 sight well she goes into quiet contemplation for a moment you  see the strands of hair that emanate from the sides of the mask slowly shifting like waves on an  ocean this vecna comes to your world to be a king  liam that or grind us all into dust  matt this is historical mortals continuously intend to find others to grind into dust if this  being has the power to block my sight he has power beyond a mortal realm did you see anything  anything else  liam we traveled to the shadowfell there 
dung	 was a tower and he had servants he had powerful  servants a woman that weve fought before and another a man a creature i dont know with a  blade a dark blade and he was too powerful for us he crushed us  matt and in your short spark with him you learned nothing more of his plan  no hint of what hes plotting  liam he threw me to the ground the first second he laid his eye on me he murdered my sister i  thought we had come to an arrangement  matt we 
none	 have  liam where is my sister  matt she lives still she is beyond my influence however your body is ash and your  soul is steeped in the divine energies that uphold the paths between life and death youve earned  your eternal rest the mask begins to recede into the darkness  liam no no come back no i will not leave them behind i want to help them still  matt the faint gray of the mask that begins to fade into shadow stops and comes back even  brighter vibrant almost you sense the mystery 
none	 of the raven queen shift from this entity that  dodges and weaves to instead a pillar of power of life and death that is both awestriking and  awefearing and for a moment you realize how small you are in her presence  you truly see to seek this to bring it to its end  liam whatever it takes  matt your resolve is admirable your love of your chosen family is vibrant what i offer you is  the power to see this conflict through to its end you will be briefly beyond the very grasp of 
none	  death and i will hold back any attempt for you to transition you will be a bulwark of my power in  cold flesh walking between heartbeats unstoppable you will have the power to walk once  more with vox machina with your sister with your keyleth and should you use this power wisely  perhaps save exandria save them save her but when its done and this foul undying king lies  dead or sealed you will return to me my champion evermore  the imposing image now shifts and changes in an instant the giant being is 
none	 now the simple woman  the mask you once saw removed now missing and there the somewhat sad beautiful pale face of  the raven queen as she steps forward the silence is broken by the sounds of her footsteps across  nothing footsteps her hand comes up warm you werent expecting as it traces across your brow  and curves across to your chin and pulls it up do you accept my gift  liam you have such loneliness in your eyes  matt perhaps you will keep me company when you come back to me do you accept 
none	  liam i do  matt then so be it you whose nature bucks destiny my beautiful thing go share what you  have shared with me with others like me take what you can learn of this vecnas plans for if he can  block his intent from one who knows what he plots against the other powers beyond the gate learn  from them ask them you have my blessing they have theirs to give as well and they may be all  that stands between the ruin of this world and you let their blessings turn the 
none	 tides  vaxildan but use your time wisely for corruption like this waits for no one now she  pulls your head down and kisses you on the forehead and brings your head close to hers and  you hear a voice whisper right into your ear ever so faintly wake up  we need to go ahead and retrieve the rest of the cast now if you wouldnt mind stepping aside  liam sure  matt thank you sighs laughs thats interesting im here in silence how creepy is  this i never get to talk with you guys

none	 diamonds anymore  liam why did we need diamonds  sam we were going to buy your soul back for a lot of diamonds  liam that makes no sense  laura it was a highcost spell  marisha attempt to resurrect you dont worry about it  laura good to know in the future though im going to save every diamond we find  taliesin we should probably i get the distinct impression this is  travis we should still call the werewolves  sam just because  travis how often are you in the feywild its like going 
none	 to philadelphia  and not eating a cheesesteak  taliesin we technically go to the feywild about once a year at this point at least some of us  but since we are here im not going to pretend i have a plan i dont know what were going to  do we are frighteningly outmatched  marisha we should probably get back very quickly before too much time passes  weve already slept here  sam if we go back where are we going where were we  laura i feel like we were in wildemount but i have 
none	 no idea  where are the places that are winter  marisha vasselheim  liam we cant do this alone  laura what about artagan thats his name right  liam thats a start  sam who  laura artagan  marisha the guy who messed with us for three days  laura yeah but he was really powerful  travis oh yeah he was i bet if we call the werewolves he will show up as well ill just  howl for them real quick  taliesin its not like we can stop you  travis true howls

none	 were going to get it  liam pickle i actually mean a little more than that  ashley what do you mean  liam well we have one god heavily in our corner but we need to go and beseech the help of others  we are not enough in this instance we need to fucking go and talk to sarenrae  sam go  laura how do we go and talk to sarenrae vasselheim  marisha is it possible  laura where is sarenrae  ashley you have a very different connection with your god  liam you can 
none	 take us anywhere  laura what a plane a heaven plane a god plane  taliesin oh my god  travis that doesnt exist right  liam the gods you dont think the gods exist after all youve seen grog  travis thats a very long discussion but i meant actual location for them  marisha i thought gods were supposed to be all omnipresent and whatnot  ashley 19  matt 19 the creator gods the prime gods the creators of exandria when they left the prime  material plane and left the realm of the elemental planes and 
none	 the divine gate was crafted to separate  their powers from the prime material for fear of causing another calamity and wiping out mortal  existence on this realm many of them withdrew and crafted realms where they reside where they  themselves harness their energies of creation and where the souls that fall under their spheres of  influence come to upon being passed the raven queen is responsible for ushering that transition  you do know that sarenrae exists on a plane like this and shes not the only god that exists on  this one particular plane 
none	  laura so how do we go there would they kill us  marisha knock knock hello i bamfed into your universe i dont know  taliesin we wouldnt come by if it werent an emergency  liam what else have we been doing for the last year and a half but knocking on different  dimensional doors  marisha i do like new vaxs tenacity  sam would we be accepted there ive done some things in my life that are less than heavenly  liam where could you not talk your way into scanlan shorthalt  sam thats 
none	 true  marisha it does immediately become the concern that i cant get us anywhere unless i have some  sort of item generally a tuning fork or some sort of attuned item to that plane to get us there  liam we start in vasselheim  marisha you said your god the raven queen shes the one who transitions people  maybe she can help  laura does pike have anything attuned to sarenrae though  liam oh to sarenrae i dont think theyre in the same place  matt ashley were you about to ask a question  
none	 ashley shit what was i going to say  sam is her symbol attuned  matt being attuned to a deity isnt being attuned to a plane of existence and those things can be  the attunement process you dont know much about what that would entail but you imagine that would  have something to do with a place of very strong holy worship of that particular deity  liam im going to assume that sometime in the last year and a half these two have told you that  i dipped into a bathtub full of blood  
none	 sam i was gone  laura no you werent  liam you just werent paying attention buddy the temples in vasselheim are old the oldest  including the temple that you helped pull out of the dirt if anywhere is attuned to the gods it  is vasselheim  travis ooh what about kord im wearing his oven mitts  liam there you go  travis oh shit  marisha does that mean i should go talk to melora  travis are we straightup god recruiting is that what you mean do gods talk to each other  laura yeah 
none	 the raven queen and sarenrae are best buds arent they  marisha i feel like when youre in the same clique when youre on the same level  everyone talks right  laura its a small group of people they have to  taliesin i think what vax is trying to say is we need patrons  laura patrons  taliesin we need patronage  travis what do you mean  taliesin were not enough we are not enough for this we are going to all die horribly if we try  anything like that again  travis we need 
none	 them with us or theyre going to imbue us  taliesin i dont know  liam pelor lives here  laura lives here in the feywild  liam pelor  taliesin oh god  liam all of us your family  taliesin we have to deal with this  marisha so we have a short list is what were saying  taliesin we need to get a slightly longer list and we have to start begging we are going to owe  favors we are going to owe our lives we are going to lose  laura are we really 
none	 going to pledge allegiance to a bunch of different gods  thats what were going to do  travis that could be cool  taliesin well see  marisha do we each get different suits matching suits but in different colors god powers  travis no youre taking it too relax a little do you want some ale  laura like captain planet  travis whos your god going to be is there a god of mischief or song or cubes  matt make a religion check  sam a religion check 14 do i add my jackofall  matt 
none	 yeah you do  sam 17  matt 17 there is the moon weaver  sam the moon weaver  travis singing oh moon weaver  matt she is the god of moonlight and the autumn season as well as the patron of  illusions and misdirection  laura who is that  sam the moon weaver a god that ive heard of once and therefore will pledge my eternal  allegiance to  laura you did  sam no were godspitballing here  laura the moon weaver they have a temple to her in syngorn  sam i have 
none	 an ioun stone  matt ioun  laura ioun is the goddess of knowledge  marisha put her on our tocall list  sam but ive been praying to sarenrae lately  ashley what if i were to channel divinity and try to make a prayer and be like hey can we come up  there right quick  marisha is it better to do that here or on the prime material plane or does it really matter  ashley i dont know  sam they dont care right  liam lets go back to your temple  taliesin we 
none	 also probably want to alert the mortal coil that everything has gone to shit  marisha also the longer were here potentially the more time gets wonky  liam were on a ticking clock here  laura lets go to vasselheim  ashley i like this idea its a little crazy but i like it  sam we should start with one god and see how it goes  laura start with one that really likes you so sarenraes a good call there  ashley well work our way through in a montage  liam worked for me  ashley 
none	 a godtage  travis do we hold hands  sam do we all get tattoos singing we need a godtage  ashley and laura vasselheim  matt to vasselheim  sam wait were just going to go  laura wait we didnt talk to artagan artagan are you here  liam is that how it works  laura can you hear us do you want to help us  taliesin maybe if we do something even stupider than holding hands in a circle  travis did any werewolves show up  matt no  marisha okay lets go  laura 
none	 right as we go i start howling  howling  matt and with a singular howl you all shift out of the feywild and then rapidly appear right on  the outskirts of the outer wall of vasselheim you see the large almost sumerianlooking structures  and walls that surround the outside the ancient architecture of the place definitely has the  oldest look and you remember seeing it from the top when you flew in through your first skyship  arrival into vasselheim the snowcovered ground and snowcovered trees as  part of the vesper timberland  marisha i 
none	 immediately look around in a 360 very quickly does there look like any big cities that  should not be here  matt you can make a perception check  liam is there a city on top of the city  marisha 19  matt as you arrive theres a weird fuzziness in your mind in regards to  laura oh shit oh god what if its been years  matt i would like all of you guys to make a wisdom saving throw please  marisha what  laura we could lose our memories  marisha wisdom saving throws 
none	  matt yes  travis not a problem  laura were immune to that right people with fey ancestry  liam no its charm or sleep  matt creatures who have fey ancestry are immune to it yeah  liam damn it i used luck and i rolled the same thing on both  matt youre immune  liam for charm and sleep  matt if you have the fey ancestry trait youre immune  taliesin i had to burn a resolve  marisha am i  laura yeah you have it too youre a halfelf  matt saving throw 
none	 yes  ashley i have advantage because of gnome cunning  matt its not a spell or magical effect its a planar effect so id say no what did you get  ashley 14  matt 14  travis eight  sam can i inspire myself  matt yeah no can you do it on a saving throw  sam i dont know its ability checks only  matt i think its just ability checks let me check just to be safe  taliesin i burned a resolve ive got to make sure that i can use the resolve  
none	 matt yeah ability checks  sam nine  matt nine  taliesin can i use resolve on this okay in that case 20  matt okay so as you guys all arrive on the outside of vasselheim the cold air hits you  grog scanlan vax is there alive in front of you  sam holy shit  matt the last thing you saw was him turn to dust and you guys left the shadowfell and then from  the shadowfell and this battle youve just now returned not as wounded as you were before  sam what happened whats 
none	 going on where are we who am i what happened whats going on  travis i have to pee  marisha laughs yeah bringing it back  laura didnt you lose your memory last time did we ever realize that  you lost your memory the last time  travis i dont know  laughter  travis are you real  taliesin he is abundantly real  ashley can i greater restoration them  laura is that how we did it before  ashley i dont know how you did it before because i dont think i was here  
none	 travis this is weird for you right  sam totally he was dead a second ago now hes alive  travis is there still dust in your pocket  matt anything that can end a curse works for it  sam i draw my whip i whip him in the face im whipping vax  laura what are you doing scanlan stop it stop it  sam hes not real hes an illusion hes an illusion  matt roll an attack roll  sam two  laughter  sam oh my eye why does my eye hurt so much  
none	 laughter  travis whats with your eye  sam i dont know it shouldnt have hurt that much  liam well call this a victory for you you have won this day scanlan shorthalt is your name  were in vasselheim  sam we are  liam were in vasselheim  sam we were just fighting a god  ashley we were in the feywild for a little while and then took a nap there and then we came here  marisha in the long run i think this is going to be better for you  matt scanlan as 
dung	 this is happening pike walks up and touches her hand on you and theres a flash  of warm energy through your body and suddenly the memories rush back to you from the feywild  sam oh god  laura thats why your eye hurts  sam his testicles hung so low  travis what  liam mine or vecnas  sam yours  laura vecna was wearing a big dress so we probably could have seen his balls  matt magical muumuu flying above the whole time  ashley ill go over and touch grog too  matt okay 
none	 thats two greater restorations the memory returns to you of the feywild  travis gasps oh i dont have to pee  laughter  taliesin this makes me wonder if youve been doing it wrong this whole time  liam its whenever he remembers  matt vax you feel this small pounding headache in your head its a very faint burn  liam i actually have this  matt yeah you shake your head and it changes in your head based on where youre facing  travis and laura what  liam duskmeadow  matt no its make a survival 
none	 check to try and figure out where  you are around the city of vasselheim  liam 19  matt okay based on looking at the placement of the sun in the sky looking at the mountain range  that this is built on the northern side of the city you get the sense that you guys are close to  the perfectly south side of vasselheim the entrance that leads toward the quad roads in the  center that burning sensation it seems to be localized no matter where you turn your head  its pointing that direction to 
none	 the northwest of your current location and the more you  concentrate on it the more you feel that hatred and loathing curl and push in that direction you  know what lies in that direction  liam do i have a sense of distance or just direction  matt let me doublecheck  laura he knows where vecna is  sam or something  laura cool  matt let me doublecheck here real fast  liam vecdar  taliesin vecnadar  liam whats your vecna victor  matt you know the distance yeah  sam you know the distance 
none	  matt you roughly know about 350 miles from where you stand to the northwest  350 to 400 miles northwest  ashley she gave you a vecna compass  laura thats badass 350 miles how far is that from us right now where is that in distance  sam sonoma  laura really its that close okay  travis it aint close its eight hours  laura eighthour drive okay  sam wait are we taking the hybrid  ashley stop off go to wine country  matt itll be fun  liam the burn that i feel theres 
none	 no question what it is for him  matt this is part of your charge this was part of the deal that you struck  travis what deal you wanna tell us  what deal it was  liam you dont hear any of that shit its in my head  travis okay  matt you are the raven queens homing missile  travis fucking a  liam so im going to need those boots back  laura why  liam because im a missile  laura i dont know what youre talking about  liam well you think about 
dung	 it you think about what youve done i know youll do the right  thing eventually  travis i have a random thought while yall are trying to go get sarenrae this is where the story of  the lord of the quad roads is if youre not familiar with the lord of the quad roads he was a  gentleman that just very quickly came into fame and fortune and hes a personal friend of mine  and i thought i might try and go find him for a favor you know one of those people if you pop 
town	 in  town they get real pissed if you dont stop by  liam is he a god  travis maybe could be not sure  liam we dont have a lot of time so do you think you could split off with somebody  travis yeah ill meet you up where we were  sam where are we going  laura to the temple of sarenrae  liam to your temple  taliesin you may not want me in company for sarenrae  liam im pretty sure we want your brain around percy i know youre uncomfortable around all 
none	 this  shit but i want you to fucking suck it up  taliesin i just dont want to say the wrong thing  laura i walk up to him and put my hands on the sides of his face  i cant have you away from me right now  taliesin this is a deeplyinappropriate convincing menamenmechanism it is working all right  sam shes beautiful  taliesin youre a terrible person  liam i mean shes okay  marisha do we need to stop by the temple of the raven queen  liam i dont think we do 
none	  laura you just had a really long conversation with her  liam i dont think we do  marisha okay  ashley to sarenrae  liam grog are you splitting off  travis yeah its real important  liam you can stay on task though right  travis yeah i could just pop in give him a little fist bump and ill  meet you at sarenraes hovel  marisha do you want a teammate to go with you  liam yeah i think you need a minder  marisha do you want to pick someone  travis fancy 
none	 a trip  sam with you grog  travis yeah  sam just the two of us wandering through a city together  travis yep you know totally behaving ourselves  liam do you see this  sam do i see what  liam hes relaxed  sam youre right i should go with him all right lets go well see you at the temple  dont go to heaven without us  laura of course not  sam all right  laura sarenraes a big fan of the cube  marisha where was the melora grove thing  matt 
none	 oh youre talking about the  marisha that we buried senokirs wifes ashes  matt youre referring to the abundant terrace within the birth heart  marisha where is that  matt the birth heart would be on the northeastern side of the city  marisha but its here  matt yeah  marisha should i go talk to melora should i go try and recruit melora  team sarenrae and team melora  liam maybe  taliesin lets do one at a time  liam yeah  marisha im just trying to save time  taliesin i think were 
none	 a bit beyond that at this point  travis besides wed know if old shit nuts is moving closer because of  liam i just know what my patron charged me with that doesnt mean i understand what it means so i  think we should start with one  taliesin were eventually going to have to tell somebody in charge whats happening but to  sarenrae lets get this ball rolling  laura lets do it  matt all right so you two are splitting off and the rest of you are going to sarenrae all right  the 
none	 five of you make your way through the quad roads towards the northern side of the quad roads  before it splits off at the base of the mountain and before it divides off towards the abundant  terrace and the trial forge the braving grounds that is where you spent a lot of time raising the  temple of the everlight sarenrae traversing there on the cold day the city seems to be as  vibrant as ever and as dour as ever as is the nature of those who live in these northern lands  but you know 
none	 smiles and existence come together occasionally you come to the temple it looks  wellkept the various clerics and acolytes that you had assigned to watch over it in your absence  over this past year and a half before you ventured out to defeat the conclave seem to have taken good  care and its warming to your heart to see what appears to be children stepping out laughing with  their parents in what seems to have been a small service of some kind and as you begin to watch  and approach you can see the acolytes 
none	 that are saying goodbye to those at the front door glance  over and see your face and they brighten immediately there you go clear your nose  acolyte sheila who is one of the older women who first helped you raise it and became one of your  first acolytes here at the temple the temple which is being known now as the temple of renewal  it is the official title of the location which is taken from the realm of sarenrae known as the  island of renewal as she sees your face acolyte sheila goes pike 
dung	 mistress pike and runs up  and takes you in her arms she tries to lift you but youre far too heavy with the armor grunts  ashley thats okay im heavier than i look  matt yes of course  ashley pure muscle  matt you guys see this woman in probably her lateforties or earlyfifties mostly graysilver  hair with streaks and bits of a dark brown its put back in some sort of a bun with a large stick  through the center to hold it in place shes wearing robes of light blue and gold very 
none	 much in the way  that youve seen pike wear most of her equipment and earlier armor to her deity she looks around  well my apologies i am sheila and i know who you are weve heard much you are welcome you  are welcome here at the temple of renewal please come in  ashley it looks lovely in here you guys have really kept it up quite nice  matt the hard part was already done come into her light please and leads you all into this  tower the excavation site here what was once a 
town	 large pit below which the original temple was  the edges have been ground down to be this slow decline and a tower was risen up the actual  stonework was ascended about 15 feet up so its not quite street level its a little below but  its this small bowl that leads to the tower itself and then it rises up a good 30 feet  laura you did this  marisha this is great pike  laura holy shit  ashley not all by myself  marisha is this how you learned all of your stoneworking stuff 
none	  ashley yeah  marisha its good like a druid could do it its very impressive  ashley thats a compliment  laughter  marisha good craftsmanship  ashley sheila sighs were trying to figure out the best way to what am i trying to say here  were trying to go to sarenrae but actually go to her not in the sense of the mind actually  walking up and saying hello  marisha i didnt realize how crazy it sounds until you say it out loud  ashley when i started i realized this is so weird  
none	 matt thats a bit beyond my realm perhaps we should speak to acolyte vincent clore hes the  keeper of knowledge and scripture hed probably be more help than i  ashley okay  laura can you try just talking to sarenrae  ashley i could try of course but maybe he will know which plane shes on and we can head there  sometimes she doesnt talk to me i can always try since were in here  matt what do you want to do  ashley ill go ahead and try you know what let me say a 
town	 prayer real quick sheila  liam want to take a knee everybody  ashley percy its fine you dont need to  taliesin no in for a penny  ashley lets all take a knee  matt the tower itself is a fairly wide tower 30 feet high at street level its about 45 feet full  height from where the baseline rising it was and the rest of the tower thats been assembled beyond  that on the inside there are four floors all of which have a hollow center about ten feet across  for in the center 
none	 of the entire tower is one long thin ascending tower of what looks to be a  sculpture of stone and gold and platinumcolored angels and clouds that all turn and twist it  rises up like this thin spire of sculpture and there at the very top you see the phoenixlike  wings clutching the ruby stone at the top the symbol of sarenrae as you step to the base of  this structure which you havent even seen finished you left before this was completed its  aweinspiring to see this thing that you saw the very early 
none	 stages of come into creation and now  its strangely comforting to know that for all the effort that you put in for all the strange  responsibility you put on yourself that none of this would get done if you werent there its  comforting to know that even without your presence it can carry on to completion and that  as it is with worship you dont need to helm it once you give it a shove  it carries itself forward  you close your eyes and you kneel below at the base of this amazing statue 
none	 one of the few only  standing to her direct worship of its size of any note to the world at this time  what do you say as your prayer  ashley well im back here and this is so beautiful im sure youve seen and have seen  whats happened where we were and i know the last time we talked you warned me and told me that you  wouldnt be there but i think were past the point of being able to do this on our own just  our mortal selves and we need bigger 
none	 help might i ask for sighs your please help us i dont  know what else to say this is beyond us now  matt as the words leave your mouth yourself prostrate before the temple you helped build with  your own hands you open your eyes but you see not the temple before you you see instead  around you essences of a vision that have been blurred at the edges but now come clear you see  around you sandy shores pearlescent almost white sand that glitters in your presence just at the  peripheral glass gems 
none	 diamonds you cant tell but the light that hits it seems to just sparkle  and give off this light you hear water around you rushing up and pulling back from the shore you  see statues so many statues before you and one that appears to be a glass fortress a spire that  rises up crystalline translucent but seeming to glow with the flicker of an internal flames  heartbeat as you look up at the top of the temple you see the wings unfurl drift towards  you and you see coming towards you the physical form 
none	 of the everlight herself her darkened skin  her beautiful smile her light hair leaving a trail of flame and gold and sunlight behind she  comes forth and drifts right before you and says then the time is right for us to meet come come  and join me on the island of renewal within the blessed fields of elysium here we can speak  ashley i immediately take a knee thank you for letting me come here just to see you and we  will come to you  matt her hands reach out and clasp yours and 
none	 the warmth of her touch is hot you feel like its  borderline burning but it doesnt hurt you instinctually that animalistic essence of primal  life tells you to pull back but you dont its a comforting heat like holding a cup of fresh hot  tea she seems to almost lift you off the feet up to her and her size which was so vast and  immense seems to come to meet yours oneonone she goes then come you have the tools you have  the means i await and as she lets go you look down 
none	 in your hand and you see what appears to be a  small little piece of curved metal made of a bright polished platinum like a u as you look  up to her again youre just staring at the statue youre staring around the temple you look  down at your hand but the item remains  marisha she just gave us a key  laura what happened  ashley did you guys see anything  laura we saw you praying and you had this crazy look in your eyes  liam you looked blissful  laura so happy 
none	  ashley wow well i went there i went to the island of renewal thats where she is and she  gave this to me  laura what is it  marisha do i recognize what it is  sam its an iud  laughter  laura youre not here  liam we all hear scanlan shorthalts voice in our minds  ashley over the earring shut up scanlan  matt structurally similar i suppose  ashley no its not  sam of course not  matt i can give and i can take away laughs its different in the 
none	 designs that have been  crafted that have been a little more crude this has once you reach out and touch it it has that  vibration to it that hint of attuned activity to the metal the pure metal that definitely gives  you some semblance of direction in your subtle understanding of the inner and outer planes and  the general cosmology that surrounds exandria  laura she gave us a key to find her  marisha she gave us a key to plane shift there this is the tuning fork that i needed  laura what the 
none	 wow  taliesin lets let people know  ashley that was cool vax you have a very different relationship with your god but  awesome that was cool  laura what was she like  ashley she was so beautiful and just glowed no and i just cant even describe it she just glowed  and it felt like do you remember the movie contact  laughter  laura yeah  sam you mean the old scroll  ashley yes the old scroll contact where she gets to the beach and her dad is there thats  what it felt 
none	 like  laura wow  ashley i need to go back there lets all go  marisha hang on do other gods live there  matt make a religion check  liam and were waiting on a guy too arent we the lady sheila ran off  ashley 23  matt 23 she mentioned the blessed fields of elysium sarenrae as you know the general  understanding of her existence in the pantheon had been faded for a while there was a betrayal to  her in the calamity and most of her following was annihilated as gods as they 
none	 currently exist  their worship is what sustains their importance and viability in the various planes she  diminished so her location her home has been kept from most existing scripture and worship both  for her protection and those of her followers so the existence of the island of renewal and where  it may be have only recently come to your attention the blessed fields of elysium though  they are a fairly wellknown location in religious circles and is also home to the fortress of the  sun the home of pelor the dawnfather  travis holy 
none	 shit  laura thats convenient  matt different area on the plane the fortress of the sun  laura singing fortress of the sun  matt the blessed fields of elysium are an idyllic plane of good  liam are these things pike knows because of her expertise or does everyone in the world know a  certain amount about  matt they know the gods and they know the realms but the name of the plane this is known  to her because of her study of religion this is more of an academic understanding of the real  
none	 essence of the gods where they come from  ashley i didnt think it was going to work sheila i think  matt sheila begins to return two minutes later with acolyte vincent clor whos this  mousylooking guy his eyes are smaller than they should be it seems for the size of his round face  he comes up with a big toothy grin i was told that you were seeking my presence  wonderful mistress pike  ashley its wonderful to see you vincent im so sorry she went to go get you i think we might be 
none	  okay and we got some answers  taliesin we should probably tell them whats going on people should start to prepare  themselves for whats coming we cant just keep this to ourselves  laura this could affect everyone  taliesin this is going to affect everyone  travis whispering tell no one  taliesin youre not here you went shopping  sam were in the house of lady favors of renewal right now  matt ill get to you guys in a moment  ashley you obviously have heard of vecna  matt no i dont  laura 
none	 so theres this guy hes a shithead okay theres this guy  matt right okay  laura he wanted to be a god but he wasnt a god  marisha three mimosas later and three hours later  laura we explain the story of vecna and tell him hes back  marisha slurring and he totally didnt call us back and i told him  im not getting back together again  matt sounds like a really really bad man  laura hes here  matt hes here  laura hes here on this plane and hes trying to become 
none	 a god and who knows maybe he succeeded  how long were we in the feywild do we even know that for sure  marisha did i figure that out with my check or no  laura whats the date  marisha yeah how much time has it been  matt the date would be  sam is there a calendar system  matt yes there is  laura but we dont know it  taliesin so hes going to tell us a date that will mean nothing to us because we dont actually  know the date we left 
none	 because we dont know how dates work  liam i think its bidetsday yeah bidetsday  taliesin bidusday bidetsday  liam lets see bidetsday  taliesin bidusday biwhatsday biheyhay  matt hold on im having to look it up because you did this to me  taliesin this is like watching the dnd icon crash  marisha its frozen  matt it is the 12th day of misothar of 812 pd  laura oh of course it is does that sound normal to us  matt it sounds like the exact same day that you left actually  taliesin well 
none	 thats convenient  marisha its the same day we left oh cool we lucked out yay  matt you did luck out i was like oh man theres a chance they could show up and have  missed the whole thing i would have had to change a lot but that would have been fun that would  have been fun  laura for one roll  matt from one roll yeah hey feywilds a dangerous thing when timetables  liam hey buddy you missed your window  ashley so basically were going to need a lot of help and 
none	 please stay in prayer  laura get ready to fight vincent get ready to fucking fight  matt you look at sheila and vincent who look like anyones inlaws and go  very well mistress right  yes well do our best  laura ps do you know anything about the fields of elysium  taliesin did you just say ps to someone did you say that out loud  matt yes they are a home to souls who champion the cause of good outside the forces of law and  chaos its a beautiful place from what the tales 
none	 say many who go never leave its so beautiful  laura what gods live there  matt as far as i know only the dawnfather himself the dawnfather is pelor  thats all i know my research is limited  laura right should you tell him  ashley i dont feel like i want to  taliesin lets gather the boys and alert whatever government we can  laura you guys thank you for your help today  ashely it was wonderful to see you guys again  matt of course my pleasure mistress pike good luck hopefully youll stop 
none	 this thing  ashley hopefully we will please pray for us  marisha amazing work if you need any landscaping done dont be afraid to ask  pike can get you in touch with me  laura melora is really good at it too we should talk to melora  marisha yeah its fine we know people  ashley thank you keep up the good work youre doing just all the great stuff  matt thank you  laura i like the idea that anywhere we go we embarrass the one person that knows anybody else  matt yep youre 
none	 those friends they smile and walk away but vincent clor definitely seems a bit  shaken by the knowledge that you just brought to him but you make your way out of the temple  where are you off to whats your next direction  liam i will note that vax feels a slight sense of bittersweet pride at the amount of bliss that  pike just went through just a little bit  matt you two where you going  travis all right so i know this guy named the lord of the quad roads back up while you 
none	 were  gone were you gone im not sure did you know that i have this little magical thing  sam no  travis no okay  laughter  travis so because you kept my secret about craven edge and you never told anybody about that  right not one time never told anyone im going to confide in you about this thing i found this  little deck of cards and i was like oh im going to pull a card out and i did and i got a  magic weapon i could throw it and it would 
none	 start fighting and stuff but that turned to rust and  so i was like i wanted to pull more out but vex was like no its so dangerous  sam thats a good impression she can be that way  travis so i went to vasselheim actually i was looking for you you little shitstack and i was  like hey ive got an idea explosion boom in my head  sam i got it the first time  laughter  taliesin this is the best retelling of this ever  travis i was like im going to find 
tavern	 a guy to pull out cards for me see what happens  sam because you were afraid or because she said you cant  travis well i heard her nagging me in my head  sam conscience  travis yeah  laughter  travis sure so i got this drunk guy on the street and i was like hey pull out a card and  guess what he pulled a card and he got wishes  sam did you get wishes  travis no because fucking i made him pick it so he goes ooh and all of a sudden 
none	 he was in fancy  clothes and he had a servant that appeared in the alley  sam did he thank you  travis he was like thanks i guess i have two more of these and he fucking ran off  sam wait he took your cards and he left  travis no he pulled the one card and it disappeared in his hand right and then he walked  off but the point is hes got two more wishes  sam on him  travis yeah and i told him grog grog gave you those remember me  
none	 sam just so im clear were going to go grab him steal his wishes leave him in a ditch  somewhere is that the plan whats our game here  travis im not opposed to it  sam whats our game what are we trying to get  travis i thought maybe if we walked in and i had a title like grog the wish giver and we were  calling to check in on him that maybe its time to pay his tithe to the wish giver and maybe he  would give us one of the two  
none	 sam okay so our game is to intimidate him into having him give you one of the wishes back  travis yeah or pressure him lay it on thick we could say like your fucking face is going to  fall off if you dont give me one of your remaining wishes  sam what happened to the deck of cards  travis oh ive still got them  sam why are we going back to get oh he has more wishes  not more cards he has more wishes  travis yes  sam and he should give one

none	 the spell and release this image and from around the corner with heavy  footfalls you watch as what appears to be some horrificlooking iron golemtype entity thats  covered in spikes and darkness and giant fists heavy impacts people start screaming and  scattering and the guards are all of a sudden gasping  travis oh no his final change is complete  sam oh he didnt look like this before  travis no its much worse  sam its much worse yes its much worse  matt at which point suddenly you watch as its size expands even 
none	 further it has metal tusks that  now protrude from the front of its face and its breathing steam and smoke its eyes red and  glowing huffing  travis i trip and fall please save yourselves run  matt the guard captain there immediately seeing this reaches back and pulls a horn off his belt  horn blows  travis im going to kill him  sam dont kill him well all die  travis i reach up and snap the horn  matt horn blows cracking  sam horns make him angrier and ill make the image go 
none	 crazy with rage  matt angrily starts stomping around not affecting anything directly  sam the only way to calm it down is if we slowly walk away in different directions  laughter  matt make a deception check with disadvantage  sam okay 24  taliesin laughs its a 20  sam its a 20  laura i bet its a 20  travis its a 20  laughter  taliesin oh god this is everything i ever wanted  matt he glances back at you reaches back and starts pulling a set of manacles from the side of 
town	  his belt and glances over at this image and you see the face of recognition of somebody who now  knows exactly what you were up to this guy is not your petty wandering guard in the center of the  street and while two other guards have rushed up to try to push townsfolk out of the way and they  have their spears drawn at this thrashing entity the captain goes stop its not real you now  see a bunch of other guards that are now after hearing the horn call  rushing around the sides 
town	 of the street  travis well you got us yep  sam should we turn ourselves in  travis yeah sure yeah lock me up first  matt he comes over  travis whack  laughter  laura no  matt roll an attack  laura youre starting a war with all of the guards in vasselheim  travis i dont think that far ahead  sam they started this war were finishing it  travis 26  matt okay roll 1d4 damage with the titanstone gauntlets and add your strength modifier  laura what are we going to do 
none	  taliesin lets hire new guards  travis ten  matt okay the helmet he was wearing which is carved around the face and eyes and nose as you  slam it with your fist it caves in a bit and he immediately hits the ground and is dazed  travis got to go  matt the other guards who were looking at him when he shouted that saw you deck him in the side  of the head and they immediately start rushing to his aid as the other guards are coming in on the  side of the 
town	 street what are you guys doing  sam are there any buildings around here  matt there are plenty of buildings around here you guys are still walking through the quad roads  and the quad roads is the most populated portion of the city the worship here of erathis is  generally about civilization theres a lot of people and a lot of buildings around what are you  going to do  sam sighs youre bigger all right i will do the old classic im going to polymorph grog into  a giant eagle the old standby the 
none	 giant eagle trick if youll accept it  travis ill get smarter sure  matt all right grog once again you feel the wings extend youre free to fly and huh thats  how numbers work you leap onto his back as the guards are coming up and you wing beats take  up as you guys begin to fly up the illusion vanishes immediately and all of the guards that  are rushing up stop see this happening and start switching over to their various crossbows and  ranged implements  sam sure yeah ive got nothing  matt 
town	 literally that escalated quickly all right so a bunch of shots trying to be taken at  both of you im going to say six to each from the crossbows whats the giant eagles ac marisha  taliesin oh gosh you are keeper of the giant eagle ac  laura is the giant eagle small enough to dimension door  sam nope  matt i rolled a perception check for that one guard and he rolled really high and saw you  walking down the street and was like oh fuck and went and got the captain  travis i 
none	 should have killed him back at the shop  taliesin is that the takeaway from this you should have killed the guard im just checking  travis im pretty sure this problem wouldnt have existed  matt all right so two shots hit the eagle for seven and six 13 points of piercing damage  marisha you are at 27  taliesin oh wait is that the  marisha wait nope i lied how many points  liam 13  marisha youre at half youre at 13 hit points  travis i have 13 left  laura its going to

none	 guys  are now beginning to rise up over the city and youre getting further out of the range of any  sort of ranged weaponry to be immediately effective but you dont know how long before  other bigger guns are brought into the fray what are you going to do you look down over the whole  quad roads and you can now see the whole city of vasselheim almost looks like a topheavy x with  the mountain range at the top the quad roads is where that x meets at the base  what are you 
none	 doing  sam oh you cant talk shit land us in an alley somewhere and  well change our appearance i suppose  travis squawks  matt make an investigation check whats the eagles intelligence modifier this would be  perception actually  marisha is this wisdom well they have keen sight so they have advantage on wisdom checks  and the wisdom is plus two although dont you maintain  matt no you do in wild shape polymorph you do not  marisha so plus two and you have advantage  matt whats the bonus to perception  marisha 
town	 they just have advantage on perception checks  travis 16  matt 16 easy enough you glance around with your eagle eyes and you see what appears to be a  darkened alleyway that is in a cluster of heavily residential buildings you dive down you  hold on screams going down into this free fall the wind rushing past you you have to grab your  hat to make sure it doesnt fly off your head and then you dive down into the alleyway come and  land and you watch as two children that were playing with sticks 
none	 glance over and go oh  sam run along now  matt screams and they run out of the alleyway screaming around the corner  sam i release polymorph  travis thank you  sam you didnt tell me that the guards all hated you  travis only one apparently that is what happens when you leave things alive  sam youre right weve learned a lesson today  travis look should we still look for the lord of the quad roads  sam i feel like that ship has sailed  travis which ship  sam maybe not sighs 
none	 maybe we should go find the others  travis all right temple of sarenrae where is that  sam i know where it is ive shat there before  laughter  travis should i wear the hat since i am apparently a wanted person now  sam why dont i just make us both invisible  travis can you do that  sam sure  travis aces  sam all right 3rdlevel invisibility right i can do me and another person  matt i believe so yeah all right so you both turn invisible and you make your way towards 
town	 the  temple of sarenrae  travis damn it  matt as you guys are leaving the temple this wonderful appearance you see commotion in the  distance and you see guards rushing from street to street  laura whats happening here  marisha do you think that guy went and alerted everyone about vecna  taliesin either that or that guard we left alive that one time ran into grog and sounded the alarm  it was probably vecna  marisha probably vecna vecnas a much bigger problem right  taliesin what would be the odds of that one 
none	 guard seeing him this is a very big city  sam clears throat it was the guard  matt you guys hear this voice out of nowhere  sam its us were here were next to you but were invisible  marisha did you get allegiance from the lord of the crossroads right  sam not exactly  laura im reaching down for a head  matt you dont find a head but you find grog  travis thanks vex you know he was indiposed we should go  taliesin are you sure we could spend some time here

none	 falling outside of the cindergrove in the cauldron that contains the  city of pyrah of the fire ashari within a short time you find yourself to the actual city of  pyrah and make your way towards the home of cerkonos  marisha i immediately look for cerkonos tell him what happened light the fire orbs the chaos  orbs crisis orbs  matt crisis orbs no worries speaking with him and letting him know the circumstance he nods i  do not know the extent in which this danger will present itself but we will light these orbs 
none	 with  what information we can we rely upon you soon to fill in the gaps of information  marisha the city  taliesin thar amphala  marisha thar amphala  laura and marisha thar amphala  marisha i believe it teleported somewhere in the northern hemisphere somewhere in a cold region  we think wildemount  laura it was snowing  taliesin we barely escaped  marisha you might want to check in with our contacts there  they might have the best knowledge  matt in wildemount you say it is a far way away  marisha well

none	 marisha its a good plane of existence  matt you plane shift all right as you all put your hands in each others you feel the familiar  sense of your physical form being drawn through the barrier of the prime material plane and much  like when you transitioned to the nine hells you feel yourselves pulled into this temporary space  this darkness this sea of endless void with a distant blinking of stars that shimmer you  understand this as being the astral sea  ashley whispering this is the astral sea  matt they dont hear 
none	 you say it because this is so fast you have no reason to have a conversation  there before you you see the glimmering almost burning lattice of the divine gate come streaking  towards you at immense speed and you know youve passed through comfortably once before so you  hope and brace for impact and pass through again that warmth almost coming to a similar state of  burning but then leaving you behind and just as fast as it passes by you you land your feet  hitting ground ground that gives  laura threepoint landing  
none	 matt okay impact the ground gives a bit with the impact and as your eyes focus a bit on the  brightness around you you can see above you a clear blue sky not a cloud in sight your hands  and feet a few inches deep into the sandlike beach of some sort of an island it seems but it  is not sand theyre granules pebbles of what appear to be shining pearls  an entire beach of pearls  laura it really is heaven  ashley this is so beautiful  matt the water laps the edge 
none	 of the shore not but five feet behind you an ocean that is clear and  lagoonlike its paradise looking ahead you can see the oncecrumbling island now finding renewed  strength with the renewed faith you can see while there are no trees on this island the hills  themselves seem to carry what seem to be old statuesque structures small templelike oddities  that have been swallowed by time and the ravages of the calamity slowly emerging like jagged bits  of earth that have been plunged up by seismic activity beyond these hills you see what looks 
none	  to you familiar a gargantuan crystal cathedral that resembles the torso of a woman but where the  head is it spires into a singular point and from the inside you see the flickering glow of what  seems to be a raging inferno that flickers like a heartbeat from the inside of this crystal citadel  here you stand on the shores of the island of renewal and thats where were going to end  tonights session  impressed noises  laura how pretty last episode was so ugly and this episodes so pretty  liam you used
