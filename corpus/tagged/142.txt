laughter  matt no vaping  marisha no vaping /none/ cries out  matt i keep seeing those signs everywhere and as a person who in no way shape or form has ever  nor would vape i  marisha it still makes you feel like youre in trouble  matt yeah well i didnt im not why  marisha im not i wasnt  matt its silently aggressive  marisha its like when a cop gets behind you when youre driving and youre just like im just  going to mess with my radio im just going to act natural i dont have any reason to be concerned  /none/ matt my registrations good and my tail lights work why am i still nervous  marisha ten and two ten and two  laughter  matt laughs so this panel is to discuss talk its generally going to be a qa here talk about  all nerdy points of tabletop gaming board gaming roleplaying games and all those fun little  adventures and experiences many of us have had in our lives or are currently discovering andor will  hopefully discover very soon for those that arent aware critical role is a show that we do  every thursdaymostly every /none/ thursdayon geek  sundrys twitch stream where us and a bunch of  other voice actors play dungeons  dragons and roll dice and have no idea what were doing  marisha we have an insane cast of people like laura bailey and travis willingham and liam  obrien and taliesin and ashley and sam riegel  matt im just going to let you guys know right now we turned down playing dd with a sloth today  to be here with you guys thats how much we love you  marisha thats true  applause  marisha and all /dung/ of our bastard friends are just sending pictures of them  matt its great  marisha they are like look what youre missing guys and im like im in pittsburgh ive got  primanti brothers take that see they know  matt i got the email two weeks ago hey would you like to dungeon master for a sloth im  like yes when is it friday oh ivans got this  marisha can i just say the most ridiculous conversations we ever had though in the geek   sundry offices were revolving around this sloth i was like /none/ guys we have to stop talking about  him like hes a real person it all started with them going well whens the sloth going to come  in and they were like well you know we got this call we got to see what his schedule is and  see when hes available because were going to have to book him out hes two weeks out and i  was like what the im available next week im pretty sure the sloth works more than i do in  the entertainment industry  matt i place the blame squarely /none/ on zootopia and kristen bell  marisha and matt yeah  laughter  marisha and then ivan was like the sloth is actually going to be playing a halfelven monk  and im like what stop saying these sentences like its going to happen its weird  matt its a wonderful time to be alive this is what personal singularity was referring to the  sloth singularity anyway we got a little offtopic there so we play dd and i grew up  playing all sorts of rpgs everything from gurps to savage worlds to rifts and most of the /none/ palladium  stuff as broken as it was it was wonderful as broken as it was  audience member broken and fun  matt exactly in a very feverdream kind of way wormwood is enough to say and you know what was  going on there ive always found tabletop roleplaying games not only for me were a great  place to explore narrative and just be more comfortable as a person i think a lot of my  social skills as a developing young adult i developed through practice in roleplaying game  environments and as a performer and /dung/ a dungeon master or game master it was such a great  playground for me to learn about what i could do and expand my repertoire and range i owe a lot of  my current life to tabletop games if not most of it i think one of the main times we ever hung  out was when i was asked to run a game of dd for you even youre part of that thanks i owe to  tabletop gaming too cute so thats my tabletop background there marisha you got started  marisha you were my first /dung/ dungeon master i grew up in kentucky its not that my parents  were trying to keep dd away from me or anything like that my parents just also didnt have access  to it and we didnt have access to it because its kentucky and you know  matt its the devil  marisha were worshipping that cult shit so then i came out to but i grew up with magic the  gathering and i played a lot of rpgs and im a big final fantasy nerd and so i was always a video  game and comic /dung/ book nerd beforehand i just didnt have the resources to play any tabletop games and  then i came out to los angeles and i was like hey matt mercer will you run a dd and i  thought youd say no and then he said yes  audience aww  matt i ran it for you and your boyfriend at the time  marisha thats true  laughter  matt so watch out for the dungeon masters out there  laughter  marisha and for all those aspiring dungeon masters it works  matt it helps to be proficient /none/ in persuasion no that was like a year and a half later you  guys were already broken up before we started dating  marisha yeah it wasnt like that  laughter  matt but whats been really cool is im not one of the og roleplaying game theres a  generation of roleplaying game people that were there from the beginning the old gygax days the chainmail  predd days where it began in strategic war miniature combat and built onto the  roleplaying from there ive learned so much from people who came from that genre and its /none/ been  really cool to watch through our show all these different generations of the old guard and you  had the 80s revamp when gurps got big and they had this resurgence in roleplaying games in the 90s  during that rob liefeld era where palladium got really popular even then it was still a very  subgenre of entertainment and socially had this stigma that had partially stemmed from a lot of  the early antidd demon magic stuff that happened and also this idea that only kids who had  no social skills and didnt want to /none/ play with other people that was the idea and it was never  that i never had that experience  marisha yeah in fact thats the total exact opposite actually how did that even happen how  did dd players get that reputation  matt largely because of media and because  marisha i mean tom hanks and mazes and monsters  matt to be fair and i dont want to get into this too deep because its a whole different  discussion but a lot of the american identity and masculinity stems from this very go sports  and /none/ theres nothing wrong with that you can do both there was this idea that if you werent the  outdoor varsity sports kid and you preferred to sit down and make up fantasy worlds then that was  considered the unmasculine thing and the notdesirable thing and of course media pushing this  whole pocket protector geek feel in the 70s and 80s especially  marisha big bang theory laugh tracks  matt sorry if youre a fan of the show no no im not there is no remorse it is not for me  that show power to you /none/ not for me theres this trend that led to this unfortunate stigma that  the genre of gaming took on for a long time and were finally pulling out of that and i think a  lot of that  marisha mainly thanks to travis willingham  laughter  matt well hes definitely helped in that regard  marisha the guy who played football in college  audience member and vin diesel  marisha and vin diesel  matt vin diesel was one of the breaking points too and i think its a combination of one pop  culture has /none/ become culture now with all of these major geek properties that everyone all of a  sudden is stopping and realizing hey we all like spiderman in this room oh okay all right  marisha thats cool yeah  matt weve had that wave of geek culture which has been really cool and now we have this  new wave of storytellers all the people that are becoming the producers and writers and actors that  are inheriting the entertainment industry are all the kids that grew up in the 70s and 80s  marisha surprise theyre nerds  matt /dung/ playing these games now you look at the people that are creating all the mainstream  media entertainment and theyre all of us theyre all the indoor kids that instead of going out and  beating up kids for their lunch money they were inside figuring out orc encounters in the second  level of the dungeon now they get to get paid for that were at this renaissance period where one  its becoming okay to talk about it and openly be proud of the fact that youre a tabletop  roleplaying geek and two people who have always /none/ been interested now have an open forum where they  can be like you know what ive always wanted to see what this was about and try it can we do  that and there not be this negative backlash and its been really really cool to watch so many  people come into this genre of gaming  alarm noise in the background  matt run now  audience member its a patio door somebody opened it they didnt shut it right  matt were all safe now  laughter  audience member its not a fire  marisha /none/ antilifeshell boof meet within ten feet of me whole room  matt fit everyone within ten feet of you  marisha everyone within ten feet  matt the best katamari damacy level ever by the way guys i want to point out this gentleman over  here who for those who saw the episode of critmas who gave me my thordak my colossal red  dragon right there  applause  marisha thats right applaud him now get up get out no no them id also like to point out  an amazing woman up front crossstitching the de rolo /none/ crest that caught my eye i know its a work  in progress is it okay if we see like what the what  matt thats amazing  marisha what the what this is insane  stephanie you can tell sam this is cross stitching  matt laughs  marisha oh my god  matt look at this thing guys  marisha oh my god you guys  applause  marisha so nice  matt this is actually a segue from my conversation ill come back to it i also want  to point out one of the wonderful things /none/ about this community that has blown me away is how many  people have gotten into the game and created their own adventures and share them with us on a  weekly basis and other people who have taken inspiration from this silly little dd show we do  and do incredible crafts like this and do incredible artwork and write their own stories and  make their own little minis and paint them and send us pictures the amount of creative  inspiration thats come out of this community is amazing thats a very valid example  marisha yeah /none/ its so incredibly heartwarming to see the whole artinspiringart aspect and thats  what i think is incredible about it like i said critical role would not be the show it we wouldnt  be critical role if it wasnt for the critters and the fan art and the fanfiction and  the music every little piece of art that you guys put out we try and catch every single one of  them and its all just incredible  matt its liams obsession he scours the internet and collects it  marisha he knows almost all the artists he /none/ knows all of you people by name  laughter  marisha im not joking im not joking  matt test him on it tell him we said that if he doesnt know it hes disappointed you  laughter  matt dont actually  audience member not on liam appreciation day  marisha yeah its liam appreciation day  matt show him your appreciation by asking whats my name  laughter  matt dont do that  audience member francis  matt there you go to finish my point from earlier whats really cool about this emerging  period of time /none/ is you have old guard and new guard coming together and discovering each other  and youre starting to find that there is no real difference in age and background we had a few  critters come by the studio one time and it was their gaming group and the gaming group was a 21  year old blond pop star a 48 year old greyhaired blacksmith we had a mid30s accountant lady and  it was every single you couldnt have picked a stranger eclectic group of individuals from  different walks of life that were sitting there and /none/ geeking out so hardcore about their last  adventure theyd had together im like this this is the magic of tabletop gaming because when youre  all at that table none of your background or where you came from matters you are all there  creating this experience together and you will remember it as vividly as any other experience  youve had in your life  marisha there is an amazing woman who wrote us i think over our facebook page not that long ago  saying how she was thanking us im a 39 year old mom you /none/ guys convinced me that it was okay for  someone of my age to play she picked up a book and started playing a game thats what i think is  the most important lesson that we can learn out of tabletop gaming in general that theres this  really sad societal pressure that starts pushing on you really hard when youre suddenly a child  then youre suddenly an adult and then when youre suddenly an adult its like youre not  allowed to play anymore and youre not allowed to use your imagination and i think thats a /none/ really  sad travesty i think its important to remember that adults can still play pretend and make  believe and that thats really important to our mental health  matt yeah  marisha especially as stressful as life is as an adult  matt its not that you can its that you should  marisha yeah  matt its healthy its therapeutic you learn about yourself through play you engage in  relationships and build relationships a lot stronger than you would elsewhere its a  wonderful medium and just one of many mediums tabletop gaming one of many /none/ mediums that allow  you to reconnect with that sense of play as an adult through all ages and its been really cool  to watch that come to the forefront of society again that makes me really happy  marisha yeah ive been saying this a lot here lately where ive slowly started to realize  especially with the show making our games weekly that keyleth has totally infiltrated me a little  bit and shes made me a better person i legitimately believe that 100 im not like  keyleth there are so many ways that shes different /none/ from me but being her for so long has  taught me to empathize with people who are like her and shes influenced me and i think shes  made me a more empathetic person i think theres a lot of important things that you can get from  roleplaying games that people dont talk about that we should  matt well its a new form of storytelling i have a very similar experience where since weve  started playing weekly i have become more schizophrenic  laughter  matt i talk to myself more when nobodys home  laughter /none/  matt storytelling as a medium is as old as weve had people the idea of telling stories and  creating mythology and the elders of the tribe telling the younger generation about the great  heroes of old whether they be historical or created its these heroic tales that inspire the  next generation to want to be better people to become these heroes to try and make their mark on  the world for the better and this is a medium for all of us where we can create something an aspect  of ourselves that we dont /none/ get to explore and experience often enough and through these games  create a character and a personality that even in the smallest way will help us be a better person  unless youre playing a totally shitty group of evil characters in which case its just to blow  off some steam and thats totally cool dont let that affect it too much but yeah its a really  cool therapeutic medium in that way as well  marisha yeah it teaches you to think differently and to think how other people might  think it breaks down the /none/ idea of the monomyth that theres a definitive line between good and  evil which ive never believed even bad characters even the evil of characters  generally have motives that are rooted pretty logically theyre good lessons  matt and marisha yeah  marisha we should take questions because weve just been rambling  matt sorry just talking at you well go ahead and start calling folks for questions here  well go ahead and start with this wonderful lady over here in the green dress  audience member um so  matt thats all right  audience member /none/ i tried to run a game once and i was awful at it because im very much okay  ive planned all this stuff out and of course nobody does that  matt were all awful in the beginning for that reason dont worry  audience member so what are things that you do to prepare or prep for it or exercises or did  you do improv classes what helps you to prep for that  matt its funny you say improv classes its not a route for everybody but it is tremendously  helpful in so many aspects /none/ of life in my opinion taking improv classes not just as an actor and a  performer but as a person it teaches you one how to work really well in a group it teaches you  a group dynamic and energy where its all collaborative  marisha it also teaches fast response time  matt yes very very quick thinking thinking on your feet when youre handed stuff you werent  expecting  marisha doctors will take improv classes to help with their response time  audience member no way  marisha true story  matt so it helps /none/ tremendously in many social aspects but one of the largest rules of improv is  yes and which is you do not deny another persons suggestion you accept it justify it  and then add your own aspect to it that whole mentality is such a great way to look at most of  your social aspects in life you know where you can take someone elses idea whether or not you  agree with it in a group setting you can take what they have and add something to it to try and  bring it closer to where /none/ you wanted it to be and its more a positive loop than a negative one  marisha and the reason why they do that the reason why that rule is there is because as soon  as someone denies you something it does two things one it makes the person who was setting up  their point look like an asshole you immediately just rip the rug out from under them two it  stops the scene so say for example if i was like hey matt isnt this ski slope totally awesome today  matt no were not on /none/ a ski slope were in a store what are you talking about  audience member laughs  marisha now i look like a fuckin asshole  laughter  marisha and then you cant go anywhere from that thats it done but if im like hey this ski  slope totally crushes some snow i dont ski  laughter  matt yeah but the snows getting kind of slick its almost like its ice wait this is an ice volcano  laughter  marisha what oh my god i didnt know you didnt tell me we were going to the ice /none/ volcano bro  matt happy birthday  both yelling  laughter and applause  marisha see how when you accept it and youre just like ice volcano totally it gives you  permission to keep going and it builds on it i think thats very important and people ask me all  the time what was your worst dm experience i was playing a buffy the vampire slayer tabletop rpg  and i was a pyromancer and i was used to him being like how do you want to do this so i got  a kill and in my /none/ head i heard matt going how do you want to do this but it was a different dm  so i was like all right so what happens is my character concentrates and then a little fireball  starts hovering over my head and then it arcs across the room and then it just poofs  and it lights the vampire on fire and they die in a blazing flame of glory and the dm i swear to  god goes yeah you know pyromancy doesnt really work that way and i was like well  thats funny you mention /none/ that because pyromancy doesnt exist  laughter  marisha its not like a real thing were playing pretend does it matter does it really  ultimately matter  matt its already dying  marisha its already dead yeah does it matter how i kill it  matt snide tone pyromancy is actually just you walk up to the vampire and light it on fire with  your lighter  laughter  matt its more of a skill trait  marisha his response was the way pyromancy actually works its more that you just like  meditate really hard and then /none/ whatever youre meditating on just bursts into flame and im  like hmm thats so cinematic so cool im just going to  matt or so different from what you suggested  marisha yeah its just giving people permission to keep going that positive loop that positive  feedback  matt mind you if she wasnt a pyromancer and did that you might be like well you dont really  have any fire powers thats a little weird  laughter  matt theres a line  marisha if i was just a vampire slayer and didnt have magical abilities then /none/ that would be one thing  matt if its not going to change the way the game plays and its cool cinematically and it makes  the player smile as they describe it theres no harm in letting most aspects of that suggestion go  through you can even tweak it a little and tone it down as a reversal but still maintain the core  of it and they still have as much fun to get back to your question outside of improv who knows  whats going to happen in the game anyway but you want to be /none/ comfortable going into it so best you  can try and think of a number of alternate possible routes you dont have to flesh them out  dramatically even have a few little bullet points of well if they go to the left they might find a  hive of ropers or if they end up going to the righthand side of this cavern structure theres  a long crevasse that leads down into a small society of fungus men and that might never  happen but if they end up going to the right you at least have some /none/ idea of where theyre going it  also helps to have a little rolodex or a collection of note cards with random npcs if you  have free time just create random characters they dont necessarily fit in your world but if  someone all of a sudden decides i want to go ahead  and see who lives in that far house you mentioned  three sessions ago on the outskirts of the farmland youre like uh  marisha or percys like where can i go to buy black powder  applause  matt another very valid example  /none/ marisha or if who was it laura bailey is like where can we go to find a map i need a map maker  sad noises  marisha too soon i guess  matt shh no spoilers  laughter  matt by the way guys this is a nospoiler zone for the record best we can we can talk about  loose things but especially from the show last thursday or the past couple of weeks try and be  careful not to spoil anything for those who arent completely caught up because it is a lot  to catch /none/ up on for some people  audience member thank you five episodes left  matt youre getting there youre getting there yeah so loosely preparing where you can but i  cannot stress enough no matter how much you prepare you will always be caught offguard  thats what makes it fun as a gm you kind of have to embrace that chaos and just see where it takes  you spend some time throwing a couple things in the world that could be tools in your toolbox if  that situation arises so youre not completely  left out /none/ in the void but through those  experiences youll eventually become more comfortable just seeing where it takes you when you  have no idea whats happening  marisha next question  matt you pick  marisha your hand went up pretty fast yeah  audience member i guess were doing the standing thing  marisha go for it  audience member in my experience having couples in a game generally puts an expiration date on  that game nothing will stop a game faster  matt im breaking up with you  laughter  marisha what was your question /none/  laughter  audience member your game is like 50 couples at this point unless i really misunderstood the  question and answer episode  matt no no thats true we are laura and travis liam and sam  laughter  matt yeah  audience member how does it change a session to have people together in real life who arent  necessarily together in the game and then theres roleplaying because ive only had bad  experiences  marisha thats a great question  matt right it depends on the people youre playing with  marisha real quick for /none/ those of you in the back who might not have heard the question he said  how do you deal with couples in games because that tends to put an expiration date either on the  game or the couple  audience member or both  matt first you always have to gauge the players who are involved if there is a concern of player  characters forming romances there being any sort of roleplaying like in our game we have  marishas character keyleth and liams character have this rossrachel romance thats been going  for a while now /none/ were also performers and were all friends beforehand and were mature and liam  even before he began to pursue this came up to me as the dm and was like im feeling vax might be  building these feelings towards keyleth but i dont want to pursue that for the story if its  weird at all i was like no its fine because i know hes a performer and we know  that separation between character and self however not everyone can be as mature or as  trained to be able to keep that separation and some /none/ people might be more jealous than others and  i have seen people who have been couples that game together and its caused strain you have to gauge  the players and the atmosphere of who youre playing with and if you dont think or have any  question that the atmosphere can facilitate that then just dont do it its not a necessary aspect  of it or at least minimize it to the point where it isnt this dramatic moonlit sequence where  theyre both staring into each others eyes and you have to sit there and watch /none/ your wife bare  her soul to the guy who every now and then looks over to you and gives you an eyebrow raise  laughter  matt sending you texts like im coming for her dude thatll be a problem you have to gauge the  maturity level and if there is a concern then dont invite it because it gets messy after  youve played with them for a while and you know the dynamic between you as friends and in the game  and you feel it can be something that can be done by all means /none/ if its a newer gaming group  or people you dont have a longterm friendship with and can get a bead on how they play with  that youve got to be a little careful as far as dming her she does not put me on the couch when  bad things happen to keyleth like the internet seems to suggest  marisha every episode it doesnt matter you could do something amazing and oh matts  getting on the couch tonight im like sure  matt its a comfy couch  marisha its a nice couch hell be fine /none/  matt yeah so  marisha theres a separation were not insane enough yet to where we dont recognize the  separation id be lying if i said we didnt absolutely get 100 emotional about our characters  and about things that happen in the game but i think those two things arent mutually exclusive  you can get emotional and you can have feelings and realize its still just a game and its still  just pretend it still doesnt mean that this game for us hasnt been incredibly important and even  though it is just pretend its /dung/ not its so much more at this point its hard to quantify  matt and marisha yeah  matt boys if youre playing in a game and your girlfriends the dungeon master and your  character dies its not her fault its how the game goes ladies if youre the dungeon master  and you kill off your boyfriends character dont do it just because you can  laughter  matt that goes for both roles but the idea is just to respect the fact that death happens in the  game difficult circumstances happen and unless you really did /none/ something to piss them off the week  beforehand and you think this is getting back at you in which case you probably deserve it and  just keep your mouth shut anyway  laughter  matt just understand it does happen dont take it personally  next question lets go in the back lets see you sir in the purple shirt rolled up to your elbows  audience member i guess this connects to the last question ive had a couple of games where ive  run where how do you manage ingame salt  marisha ingame assault  /none/ matt salt anger  marisha oh salt i was like what is happening at your games  laughter  marisha is it a fight club youre running jeez ingame salt  audience member sodom and gomorrah  matt roll save vs pillar  laughter  audience member sometimes people lose control of the game and they dont play well with each other  matt it does happen  audience member in a college game we had a lot of different people playing and it does seem hard  to get together how do you manage people in that sense  /none/ matt totally its a valid question for those of you who didnt hear it how do you manage a game  for many different types of people who want different things out of the game that can cause  conflict and sometimes strife within the gaming group both incharacter and outside one i would  be very clear with all the players before you even start playing what kind of game you want to run  and what everyone wants out of it its very hard to run a game that will appease all the hardcore  roleplayer theater geeks /none/ and all the numbercrunching minmaxer diablostyle kill shit  and take loot gamers you can find a happy medium but you have to make sure everyones on board for  the happy medium before you get too deep into the game otherwise youre going to have the party  trying to pull totally different things out and frustrated when none of them are getting exactly  what they want you want to make sure that everyone understands what youre shooting for  that everyone in the party expresses what they want for their own fun because even though its  /dung/ your game as the dungeon master everyone brings something to that table and you have to make sure  that its part of your job to make sure everyone is still having a good time two not all gamers  will gel there are plenty of people that i had a good time playing with but i know that these  gamers would do terrible in a group together ive run different sessions that have been fun but i  know i couldnt cross those parties they would tear each other apart that just comes from  experience and reading /none/ it based on those discussions also if any of these issues start  arising during the game talk to them outside of the game after the session ends if you felt any  of that weirdness shoot an email off make a phone call to them individually and be like hey  i felt some strange stuff going on here do you have any concerns or anything you want to talk  about just hear them out dont combat it dont try and shut them down just like any personal  interaction listen to what their feelings are whether or /none/ not you agree with that let them get  it out and then from there try and explain as to what youre trying to accomplish with the game and  ask the question is this the kind of game for you if the person can go ahead and work towards  that collaborative storytelling experience and try and compromise for the sake of the entire story  and the group what it is theyre selfishly wanting versus what the whole group wants then youll be  fine if not maybe they need to find another group that suits their needs /none/ as a gamer theres  nothing wrong with that at all i played many games with people that we dont blend as gamers  but i wish them well in the stuff they do and i dont hold anything against them for that  marisha going off on this as a player and talking to everyone else out there who are players be  kind to your dm not only because he can kill you at any moment but  matt laughs  marisha respect your dm and respect the time that has been put into these games because thats /dung/ not  necessarily this is what you were saying but you will sometimes have one of those players that gets  in and has that bull in a china shop type of mentality and just wants to take over a little  bit theres nothing wrong and to dungeon masters theres nothing wrong with being like  hey thats not cool because do understand players that your dm has put in probably at least  an hour if not more for each hour you play of game time theres already probably been ten  hours of prep before you even /dung/ showed up to the game youre all there for fun and its a blast  and its awesome but there is theres a line you guys know what im talking about where  theres a line of being respectful and having fun and joining in as a group as opposed to mocking it and  matt trying to get a rise out of the other players or out of the dm  marisha right or trying to hijack the whole game which is disrespectful not only to your  dungeon master but to everyone else whos set aside time to /none/ be there you know dd its coop  youre working to build a story together and if you can do that and find a group with good  chemistry that can do that thats when youll be the most magical of moments  matt if a person isnt working out especially if youre the one thats running the game you  invited them to be a part of your story and your gaming experience if you dont think its going  to work you have every right to not invite them back if you explain to them why and in /none/ a very  rational and very respectful way and they still cant handle it then thats just even more of a  clarification as to why this probably shouldnt continue with them as part of your story most  times in my experience people will be more understanding and a lot of times theyre just not  aware of it once that discussion happens oh i didnt realize i was acting that way or i see  what youre going with okay now that im aware ill try not to act that way anymore im a firm  believer that /none/ 90 of the worlds problems are based on misunderstandings and through  communication we can solve 90 of the worlds problems doesnt mean we will but i believe  thats the case laughs  marisha yeah does that make sense were not trying to be a fun police theres a difference here right  matt yeah  marisha makes sense okay your fun is wrong  matt i was waiting for it  marisha yeah im not trying to do that yeah next question  matt you pick  marisha okay you had your hand up yeah  audience member /none/ this actually ties into that last question because you guys had that with tiberius  leaving and i know that its been said it was a very amiable leave and you guys are all still  friends and everything is there any chance that he maybe not come back permanently but would  come back and pop in and do a oneshot type thing with you or come in and guest star for one episode  matt sighs  laughter  matt uh  audience member next question  matt and marisha laughs  marisha yes and  matt i /none/ will say we have nothing but the utmost respect and appreciation for everything that orion  brought to the show and the character tiberius in the time that we did play together however some  circumstances in life come to a point where they have to go their separate ways he has his paths  to walk we have our path to walk and we wish him well and weve supported him through that entire  endeavor what the future holds i cant say you know circumstances change people change i cant  tell the future and i like to /none/ think the best of most people in all circumstances i cant give an  answer one way or the other whatever hes up to whatever the future holds i wish him the best of  luck and we shall see laughs next question  marisha and matt laughs  marisha yeah you in the plaid yeah you yeah  laughter  matt theres a lot of plaid suddenly in the audience  laughter  audience member this is more of a dm question im a new dm like very new dm  matt welcome yes  audience member im currently /town/ homebrewing a campaign in a world and where did you even begin  building your world whats the process that you took doing that  matt this is a great question its a great question because when it comes to especially  homebrewing your own content and as a new dm there is nothing more frightening and daunting  than going okay  marisha im going to build a world  matt nervously where do i start  laughter  matt really the biggest thing is to keep it small youre not building a world youre  building a town /town/ you figure out a couple shops build maybe a couple dozen npcs even less if you  want to for your first session come up with a couple of factions like a merchants guild or  maybe a sailors guild maybe theres a little underground thieving ring or a fence thats  running a darker circuit in the town and you just really flesh out this one little town you  can build two or three adventures that work just in this town then once you play a game with your  players in that town what they do the /town/ actions they take will inspire you to think of other ways  that you can expand the world from there that town will give you as many sessions as you want  depending on how much further you want to go into the rabbit hole of what this town has there could  be a whole ruin beneath the town that opens up a whole subterranean portion of the campaign and  theyve still only been in this one town then you can run ten 12 15 more sessions just in this one  little area the inspiration of playing /town/ in that one little town will help you build the world it  will give you ideas in between then you expand to one of the neighboring towns or one of the  neighboring deserts which has what used to be a town that is now completely buried by sand and  the elements have destroyed but theres now a tribal society of rather unscrupulous individuals that  are now attacking caravans from the first town now you can flesh out where that is maybe theres  a small society there where theyre actually not that bad theyre just trying /none/ to survive but  theyre being kept at bay by these subterranean desert creatures that are now starting to rise up  and fight them and theres now three sessions you could do with this other secondary desert  civilization youve done 15 to 20 sessions with two towns you dont have to create i dont know  where any of that came from by the way youre welcome to use it  laughter  matt those are just two locations where you can run many many sessions and thats building your  own homebrew world but you didnt have /none/ to create the world its very hard for you to do that when  i began running their game i created stilben and that was for the first two sessions then i  created westruun and that was for the next six sessions these are eighthour big sessions that  we could only play once every four to six weeks i didnt have taldorei figured out until they were  getting towards the end of westruuns arc towards the first winters crest festival and i was like  well ive just started developing the clasp and theres a part of /none/ the clasp here in westruun but  theres got to be a major center for the clasp there has to be a major center to this continent  theyre on and i began to develop emon and that was leading up to the winters crest festival and  when they finished up with that then i could lead them towards emon and then i began to flesh out  emon the more they expressed it its very much like trying to catch up to the train while being  on the tracks youre like okay and then whats happening next /none/ week next week i get the feeling  they might want to go ahead and check out this petting zoo sure lets flesh out the petting zoo  laughter  marisha now theres still so many times where im like how did you know we were going to do that  you had some inkling that we were going to do that and i dont know why you just someone just said  something in passing and youre like theyre going to do that  matt heres the key i have six inklings of what youre going to do and /none/ i try and prep some of all  six so when you choose one of them i go i totally had that figured out  laughter  matt or when you pick one that wasnt one of the six and i go weakly oh i totally have that  figured out  laughter  marisha my favorite was when we walked into the back door of the clasp of the thieves guild and  he wasnt prepared for it man that was a good game  laughter  marisha that was great we just were like yeah lets do this /none/ now and ill still never forget  your face when you were like clicks tongue okay then  laughter  matt im like yeah we got like three more sessions before they actually meet up with the clasp and  theres stuff to where are you going  marisha youre walking in the back door all right  matt come on in  marisha youre basically like knocks hey yo whats up clasp yeah we kind of went in the  back door and yeah laughs and matt rolls out one of the dryerasable marker grids and starts  just /none/ drawing the clasp this is where the clasp lives  matt were going off grid folks were off grid  laughter  marisha here we go good times  matt so yeah its going to go weird  marisha i imagine its kind of like when you start an rpg and theres the fog of war on the map  and you kind of slowly flesh out the map as you explore and you just kind of lose the map fog i  think he builds in the same way  matt yeah  marisha i cant say im not /town/ speaking for him  matt yeah but if and you want to just make up names of places be like whats a good name for  an elven city zorvana  marisha purvan  matt right thank you whatd you say  marisha purvan  laughter  matt thats a real name  applause  matt the elven city of purvan  laughter  matt and someone says well where are you from sir and im like well i hail from the elven  city of purvan you just made up a name but now down the road you can /none/ then begin developing this  elven city of purvan  laughter  marisha perveon  matt and it sounds like youve had it planned this whole time because the name was mentioned so  many sessions ago it only really clarified a week ago but they dont know that magic  laughter applause  marisha next question  matt good question  moderator oh my  marisha screams  matt okay weve got to start moving through these  marisha you pick one hey do we have a panel in after us  audience yes  matt curses  audience /none/ member yes youve got an 18  marisha all right lets keep going oh we have 18 after us  matt weve got 15 minutes  marisha okay go go  matt were going to start trying to make this go a little faster so we can get through as many  questions you sir right there in the gray yes you rise  audience member well just for those of us who are running curse of strahd do you have any  insights into strahd  matt laughs  marisha just for those who are running curse of strahd /none/  audience member just nonspoilers i dont know if youve read the scenario but insights into the  character  matt i havent run the new scenario of course ive been running my own but ive played through  two different expedition to ravenloft campaigns played through one and dmed one strahds one of  my favorite villains probably one of the better villains of all the dd campaigns for a reason  because hes a complicated villain he has a lot of very interesting things going on internally  and not all encounters are about seeing strahd fighting strahd /none/ he likes to talk he likes to  learn he likes to take beads on players if youre running a game for players strahd is  powerful and yeah if he showed up to start a fight with the characters the second session in he would wipe  the floor with them but sometimes strahd just  wants to talk and find out about them ask them  questions maybe see elements of their history that nobody should know and start messing with  their head barovias a strange place like that secrets are traded around and god knows what /dung/ the  vistani manage to hear in the whispers while youre sleeping and dont realize youre talking  in your sleep such a great place barovia for a dungeon master very scary place for a player  laughter  matt its hard to say anything without spoiling the character because theres a lot of intricacy  to his backstory and a lot of his origin story his previous love his brother theres so many  aspects of it but strahd i will say strahd is more than the surface dracula vampire you  think he may be theres a lot /none/ going on there for good or bad theres a lot going on next question  marisha lets do in the back yeah you whos going like this yes you  matt sometimes it helps to flail  audience member so i watch critical role and all that and i was just wondering i was just  wondering as a dm and aspiring possible voice actor i want to try to do that in the future  what are some tips you could possibly give dms as well as actors  matt lets see one  marisha thats deep thats a /none/ big question  matt ill try and make this as concise as possible improv classes once again huge benefit  both as a player and as i mean look at sam sam was at ucb for a long time and it shows he is so  fast even if he has no idea what the hell is going on  laughter  matt so it helps both sides the player and as a dm its great but when you have free time on the  freeway driving in traffic practice voices improvise dialogue yourself im that crazy guy on  /town/ the road thats talking to himself and everyone else is like what the hell is that guy doing over there  laughter  matt and if you like a voice you have never done before pull out your phone real fast and record 30  seconds of you just talking in it because now you have something to go back to to remind yourself of  that and you can assign that to an npc every npc that i create for the most part i have in  parentheses at the end of their brief description a texture a pitch /none/ and sometimes a dialect so  ill go through something like relatively thick cockney kind of gritty lowpitched or be like high  and reedy voice more of a thick scottish slightly abrasive and those are quick notes for  you to go back to but you find those voices by just practicing in the shower when you have time  to yourself  marisha you stopped and looked at me very expectantly  laughter  marisha but yes im ready ive got something im good  matt i thought you were ready  marisha i am  laughter  /none/ matt the illusion see  marisha yes see im so ready im on top of it ive slept today what was i going to say a lot  of people ask us we are not voice actors and you guys do all these voices and i want to be a good  dm like you but im not a voice actor and you dont have to have this insane mel blanc type of  range to be a dm just even changing the placement of where the sound comes out in your mouth can be  enough of an identifier /none/ so for example i naturally speak at the back of my throat which is  why ive got this gravelly thing which my theater teachers hated but they love it in voice  over but if you start moving it more to the front of your mouth and you start dropping little bit  more breathy i didnt change my tonality at all and this is more where keyleth lives its a  little gentler its a little softer and you dont have to necessarily change i dont have to  go to the crazy voice to do anything crazy /none/ its a little bit of placement and that can just make a  world of difference you talk all the time about voicing women when you dm and you dont have to  sound like an snl character  matt highpitched british voice ello weve all done this dms any guy who has ever dmed has  gone monty python dont deny it but sometimes you just change in physicality too i can be  talking to you like this or i can be talking to you like this and its not changing voice but  this is an entirely /none/ different type of physicality to a character if im talking the same voice like  this but im standing up a little with the shoulders to the front looking down at you its  an entirely different character no change in voice but the physicality can impart an entirely  different delivery experience of that dialogue and engagement is the key even if your voice  doesnt change engaging your players making eye contact and i know its hard if you have notes  down there back and forth but dont be afraid that when you finish your notes or /none/ when youre  feeling comfortable in those little npc diatribes to then engage once more because its that  contact that one helps facilitate the players to be more into roleplaying in the moment its the  difference between saying the shopkeeper offers you a better deal then going i offer you a better  deal ones a little more engaging its the same circumstance but it just puts the player in the  moment where theyre having to connect with you and that gives them permission to then offer that  same energy back and not everyones going to /none/ be comfortable being that heavy into roleplaying  some folks it takes a while to come out of their shell and thats totally fine dont ever feel too  frustrated or exhibit that frustration on the player encourage them to be more comfortable and  if they arent then its totally fine but you present that opportunity for them to get out of  their comfort zone and maybe discover something about themselves they didnt know they had kind  of like i did anyway that was a roundabout answer all right  marisha oh i picked him so you /none/ pick  matt okay im trying to go through this pretty  quick round so that we can get through some questions here  you have a very nice jacket and collar i have to call on you there  marisha oh you got like a cap thing going on is there a presentation i feel a presentation coming  matt oh no this is from fallout yo no maccready wore that for a while  moderator oh my god it is okay go for it  matt question oh we got preston garvey  matt dont you dare send /none/ me to another settlement that needs help by the way guys ive helped  like 60 of them and none of them can take care of themselves  marisha i was just there damn it what do you mean theyre getting attacked by bandits  matt i just killed the ghouls ugh sorry question  audience member i had a bit of a curiosity as ive never been one for dming its never been my  style but i get really into characters a lot i build characters in my free time  matt mmhmm totally as a dm thats /none/ all i can do  audience member i wanted to know as voice actors have you ever walked into the booth read  the script and realized that you already made the character youre voicing that its been so  drastically similar that youre like holy shit next youre going to tell me that his mom is abusive  marisha yes  audience member do you have a story for it  matt i have a few i will say that a lot of the characters that i audition with and a lot of the  characters that i play /none/ in video games started as npcs in my old campaigns both eder and aloth in  pillars of eternity were characters in an old campaign i ran out of high school a lot of  character voices and personalities for me at least i transitioned from the game and then  brought into my toolbox as a performer as far as finding similarities in them fantasy genre  especially has its own tropes like oh my god his parents were also killed when he was young  and hes an orphan wandering the land with power wandering swordsman in search /none/ of a purpose that  sounds just like every high school dd character ever so yeah ive definitely had similarities  in those regards  marisha even the episode not too long ago so it shouldnt be huge spoilers where grog fought  earthbreaker groon and he called upon scanlan and vax and he was like where do you get your power  from my friends everyone was like this is the anime episode its so true its so tropey  applause  marisha you just cant help it  matt some tropes come from honesty  marisha the power /none/ of friendship  matt craven edge says otherwise good question you have a question or were running out of time  audience member one question what are your times for your autograph panels tomorrow  matt strongbad voice ah that is a very good question i will look this up with the one percent  on my phone so it doesnt die okay so tomorrow on saturday we have autographs at 1230 to 130  so long as you bring your stuff to get signed well go ahead and put our signatures on it even  have posters to sell /none/ with artwork from kit buss and critical role with keyleth as an earth  elemental jumping onto kvarn its really cool you should have one then on sunday we have our  autograph session from 130 to 200 so if you dont come tomorrow and youre running out of  time come on sunday  marisha thank you strongbad  matt strongbad voice youre welcome  cheering  marisha next question yes  audience sing trogdor  matt singing trogdor needs more questions answered  audience member i have a question for marisha what are your times because i know /none/ theyre  different  matt singing they dont know what your times are  marisha oh 11 really apparently im signing at 11  matt singing marishas signing at 11  marisha i just go where they tell me to go look on your schedule next question yeah you doing  ninjutsu yeah you yeah the rick and morty yeah  audience member yeah sweet  matt man you are prepared for this panel  audience member this is a week old and its still healing by the way  matt that looks awesome  audience member i knew i /none/ was going to come meet you before this guy named zombie but i got a bit  more of a crunch dm mechanics question ive been dming pathfinder for a few months shy of a year  now and as far as the difficulty of combat is concerned im starting to find myself leaning on  certain things that may be a little less fun for my players like ive been dealing with the  tanky warriorcleric with probably a little bit more grappling than theyd like me to ive been  leaning back on reach weapons an annoying amount /none/ so what do you do to bring a fair challenge  without recycling reach weapons grappling cheap magic spells off a spontaneous caster how do  you keep it interesting without getting cheap on your players  marisha good question  matt cheap works on occasion but also consider not all challenges are based just straight on  damage mechanics and weapon use building interesting and dangerous terrain for a battle can  make what seems like a relatively pushover combat into a very very precarious situation for the  party if you have an entire group of individuals that /none/ are across a giant chasm with ranged heavy  crossbows and the party cant find a way to get across because theres perpetual wind blowing up  across the way but their bolts are enchanted to be resistant to the wind as theyre native to this  terrain thats a way where the partys like oh crap were just being pegged to death from a  distance or consider fighting in a place that itself is very fragile and the terrain itself is  collapsing during the battle and elements of it begin to fall away were talking top of /none/ icecrown  style battle with arthas you know who you are if you got that reference because we all suffered in  torment trying to finish that fight or consider there could be elements to the battle where the  enemy might be resistant to most damage until you discover an aspect hidden within the room not  quite like a lichs phylactery but something that character is bound to that is hidden within that  battlefield and so its half a battle and half trying to search and scour the scenery for a means  of disabling their defenses /none/ or consider a battle where there is a large amount of innocents that  are locked away and the longer the battle goes collateral damage and innocents are being killed  until the party can try and spend more time defending them versus just keeping the damage onto the enemy  marisha who are you  matt im coming up with different ways to fake challenge or it can be enemies that as opposed  to just dealing damage its a very very high piece of terrain and they are more about grabbing  and chucking things off of cliffsides /none/ or elemental aspects a lightning storm where you  randomly start striking down on areas of the battlefield enemy or friend i dont know  marisha no keep going im taking notes mental notes  matt these are all just random things that could add difficulty or challenge to a battle without it  just being a direct my guys have longer weapons than yours which has its place but if you find  yourself recycling those tropes too often then think of other things outside of just damage and if a  creature you want them to fight doesnt /none/ quite have an interesting toolbox you can create abilities  that they have beyond what the book tells you perhaps this one brand of giant scorpion lived too  close to a cluster of longburied pure arcane energy and is beginning to mutate these crystals  and whenever anybody attacks them with a physical attack it creates a feedback shockwave of arcane  energy that does additional damage think of things that you can attach to existing creatures  to make them different  im getting the wrapup sign which means i failed at answering questions rapidly but i think /none/  thats the nature of the panel  marisha one more quick question guys  matt and were out of here you pick  marisha oh boy you look so eager back there yes  audience member i run an rpg group at my local library its my first time dming so im really  nervous advice  marisha firsttime dm tips  matt nervous is part of it harness the nervous energy thats whatll propel you when youre in  that seat of not knowing whats happening understand that its okay to be nervous and be  afraid of /none/ whats happening  marisha use the adrenaline rush the  adrenaline is real  matt biggest advice i would give for this circumstance is one have a chance to chat with  the players enough if theyre people you dont know very well originally meet with them each  individually for lunch and get to know them as a person beforehand so you kind of know what youre  getting into before you start the game also asking them what they want out of the game so you  can tailor a story that hopefully theyll all be happy with /none/ and get what they want out of the  experience and kind of what i said before prepare as best you can but dont overprepare  because if you overprepare one or two major paths and they end up completely veering off to the  side you will have spent all those hours on something that no one will ever see and have no  idea whats going on or conversely try and find ways you can redirect the story back towards what  you had prepared so i would recommend as opposed to really fleshing out one path loosely /none/ flesh out  multiple paths and give that opportunity where you feel like you have kind of a handhold on whats  happening but not fully as opposed to having a really good grasp on one path and if it goes any  other way youre screwed i hope thats helpful  marisha lets do one more quick question thats a good closer lets do up front yeah  audience mr mercer what is your favorite part of dming and ms marisha what is your favorite  part of playing with mr mercer  matt you first  marisha my /none/ favorite part of playing dungeons  dragons just in general as a part of any game  is the ability to have dreams later on in that world and be like oh shit my brain just thinks  that all actually happened and im kind of okay with that  laughter  marisha im kind of okay with looking back at the memories of me having that orlando trip in sixth  grade and the memories i have of fighting a beholder are pretty much the exact same in my head so dope  matt my favorite part of being /none/ a gm or dm is every time you describe to a player the reaction  to an action they took that they were trying for and were successful or a massive failure but  some sort of reaction to an action that they attempted and watching them light up and smile as they  suddenly realize that theyve driven a part of the story forward and they realize that they have as  much agency and the ability to create in the space as you do and that to me is above and beyond the  gift of being a /none/ dm is watching other people create in the world that you created  audience thank you  marisha good final question thank you guys so much  applause  matt i know many of you didnt get your questions answered thank you if you still have questions  we have other panels throughout the weekend you can search the schedule theyre mostly voice  overrelated but if you squeeze in a roleplaying game question here and there we wont argue  marisha i have a stunt acting and stunt fighting for the camera panel tomorrow from 830930 or  9301030 /none/ something like that its fun and you bring sweatpants and get active because i teach  you how to punch dont punch each other though  matt all right guys thank you so much for coming  marisha the morning one at nine got canceled because you guys arent going to be up dont lie  im not going to be either so its the later one do the later one not the 9am one i wont be there  matt thank you all so much have a wonderful evening well see you tomorrow  cheering  elevator music
