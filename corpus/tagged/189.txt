panel  of extremely mature  travis no one can hear it man  it doesnt exist  sam singing in the morning  matt anyway  bringing us into tonights episode  leading up to where we are  currently in the story  vox machina having spent a period of time battling with the chroma conclave /none/  a collection of evil  and allied chromatic dragons  that terrorized the taldorei countryside  have acquired artifacts  called the vestiges of divergence  after traversing the planes and locations to gather allies they made war  on the current occupying armies  of thordak the cinder king  in the center of the capital city of emon  managed to eke out a victory  destroying thordak  and apparently go into battle  with a dragon theyd made an alliance with  known as raishan the diseased deceiver  a member of the conclave  /none/ with which they had  a very tenuous agreement to work together  after being nearly killed by raishan  as she flew the coop essentially  you managed to collect  the remaining armies of the city  made sure everyone was okay  you ran into an old friend from westruun  kerrek who had brought  a number of his ablebodied warriors  with him to aid in this battle  you then made your way to whitestone  with kerrek to ascertain the location  of raishan the diseased deceiver  of which apparently she had /dung/ absconded  to whats called the island of viskon  it used to belong to a necromancer  and then briefly became the lair  of thordak the cinder king  before his original attack on taldorei  roughly 16 years ago  you then gathered your weapons  your armor and your reserve strength  and with a couple of allies  traversed through teleportation  all the way to this island  managed to battle your way  through a deep dungeon  that once this necromancer called home  going past traps  and chasms filled with /none/ undead  and gravity reversed  through magical means  you made your way into a small tunnel  just past this area  into what seemed to split into two sides  behind that what appeared to be  the necromancers sanctum  some sort of necrotic laboratory  where you discovered there within  two of the eggs of thordaks lair  that were taken by raishan  the corpse of thordak  folded in the corner  and apparently raishans  female human form  currently poring through books  and rummaging through  what currently appears /none/ to be  the relatively untouched necropolis chamber  so last we left off  the two twins had snuck ahead  to take a look and take in  the information of this vicinity  while the rest of the party  began to slowly approach from behind  as the rest of the party  is coming behind  i would like everybody else  to make a stealth check please  marisha do we have pass without a trace  laura yes no  matt i dont believe you cast it did you  taliesin ages ago /none/  liam yeah ages ago  i just dont know how long it lasts  travis yeah its been a while  matt youve lost concentration  since then  laura yeah i dont think ive cast it  since we came out the other side  liam flying up on the broom all that  laura natural 20 for pike  travis thats a good thing  matt great she has disadvantage  because of her armor roll again  well no she put on the elven boots  didnt she  laura no kima did  matt thats /none/ right so yeah roll again  liam just roll another 20  travis just do it again  here we go hi hey  marisha weve done it before  and we can do it again  travis not as great  liam never mind  travis what is it  laura four  matt four  travis plus plus  laura nothing  travis cool 13  taliesin eight with a natural one  marisha ten total  sam not good  travis lets be honest  she fucking knows were here  patrick this was my one 20 /none/ of the night  folks everyone else  laura failed you  marisha it just means you wont die first  taliesin she doesnt know youre here  laura yeah youre invisible  you have an invisibility ring  patrick i put on the ring and i just leave  all laugh  patrick just gone  matt one step  taliesin and thats how  bilbos insurance company started  just going home we can start again with a real job im done  liam 30  matt 30  laura wait the twins are rolling too  i /none/ shouldve taken that 20 for myself then  liam yeah i thought you did  matt you guys are still  on the same stealth roll as last time  youre fine grog  travis 13  matt 13  liam what the fuck was that  laura i dont know  trinkets still in my necklace  matt trinkets still in your necklace  laura i left him in because he healed  hes in my necklace  matt he is  laura okay  matt all right so  as you guys turn the corner  on the /none/ right side of this hallway  you saw this laboratory  filled with bookshelves  chains candelabras on the walls  a large door across the back wall  there are two pillars  in the center of the room  that are strewn  with various magical engravings  you see this bunch of books  scattered across the ground  pulled out of the bookcase  and theres one thats opened  against this bookholding platform  you see two cages  in the back of each corner  that seem to contain  some sort of slumped /dung/ corpse  or body of some kind  its hard to see  in the low light of this room  because the only light youre getting  is from the candelabras in the space  there you see the woman  with long dark green hair  silverish pale skin robes  piercing eyes of yellow and emerald  as the rest of your party catches up  from behind you  with the eversosubtle sounds  of metallic footfalls  and plated armor against plated armor  the female figure seems unfazed by it  and just continues /none/ to turn a page  and grab another book  takes a book and reads a passage of it  and throws it off in the corner  theres a pause  before the female figure stops  and still facing away begins to speak out  into the air of the room  well you certainly proved quicker  than i anticipated  but i unfortunately have business here  and i would kindly ask you all to leave  the conclave has served its purpose  as you have served yours  we have nothing more to discuss /none/  turns another page of the book  and continues facing away  liam can i look at the ceiling  every other part of this room  except for where she is  to see if shes also somewhere else  matt sure make a perception check  travis i think we should just leave  all laugh  liam 22  matt okay glancing about  even with your lowlight vision  the halls here  are roughly 20 to 25 feet wide  and about as much in height as well  25 to 30 feet tall /none/ carved arches  you dont see any other alcoves  or hidden spaces  it appears to be  just this figure in this room  amongst the rotting corpse of thordak  and the two eggs tossed to the side  patrick im going to burn  my final divine sense  just because ive never been exposed  to this creature at all  shes got a lot of extra names  like the diseased  and the corrupter and whatever  so i dont know if she might be  i have no idea  im just /none/ trying  to draw a bead on whatevers in the room  matt right  patrick its 60 feet and i think  its fiends corrupted and undead  location and type  matt correct okay  so as you hear these words  echoing through the hallway around you  the rest of the group the tension rising  you watch as just through a quick glance  each ally in the room  their bodies just instinctually tighten  their muscles getting ready for anything  at this point in time  you close your eyes and focus /none/  on the presence around you  you do not sense anything  patrick okay  matt no celestials  no fiends no undead  laura did the party  as they were clomping along  did they catch up with us at all  or are they still that far back  matt theyre still this far back  nobody has  this is where you guys stopped  upon the discussion happening  so the twins are still up ahead  the rest of the party  is halfway through this unit here  the actual chasm ends /none/  over on this side here  and this is the entranceway  with the fountain you had discovered  travis somebody  should roll off to the left  laura before any of that happens though  i want to get pike to step forward  so shes within 30 feet of everybody  as many people as possible  can she be right in the middle  matt thats about as close to middle  as she can get right now  marisha can we all move up a little bit  taliesin im going to peel off /none/  a little bit to the left  laura but wait just a fucking second  so she can cast beacon of hope  on everybody just one second  shes trying to help you  taliesin i just got yelled at  in my earpiece so i will not  laura pikes like  just a fucking second  let me cast beacon of hope  taliesin sorry sorry  travis pike swore  marisha pike  matt whats the range  on beacon of hope  laura 30 feet  matt 30 feet all right  so that /none/ would get  that would be everybody  everybody is currently under the effect  of beacon of hope  sam what does that mean  patrick which is  sam we are very hopeful now  laura which means  that you are hopeful and vital  matt is it a perpetual radius of her  or does it affect each person  at the time of casting  laura it affects everybody  at the time of casting  matt okay  laura i think  it just says range is 30 feet  choose any number of /none/ creatures  within range  for the duration each target  has advantage  on wisdom saving throws  and death saving throws  and regains the maximum number  of hit points when healed  matt yes thats correct  all of you guys have this effect on you  as long as she maintains concentration  so keep tabs on maximum healing  and wisdom saves and death saves  taliesin is she really there  or is that an illusion  laura i cant tell  can i tell if its really an illusion  or does /none/ it look like shes really there  marisha can you sense her  taliesin yeah try to sense  laura well i couldnt sense her before  when she was in her human form  so im assuming i cant sense her now  marisha like shes got something  masking her that whole thing  laura yeah i mean  travis shes the deceiver  laura i did the dragonsense  right before we came down this hallway  and i sensed three dragons down here  taliesin okay  marisha right okay  matt okay in the time /none/ its taken you guys  to deliberate and discuss this  and the long awkward pause  thats transpired  after raishan said  the previous thing she did  her voice picks up once again and says  whereabouts is your brass pet  laura whereabouts are you  matt no response  marisha keyleth steps forward  a little bit towards the twins  travis percy and grog  are going to roll off to the left  taliesin were peeling off to the left  and im going to wallwalk  im going to keep going  /none/ until im on lineofsight  with the red eggs against the back wall  matt you can get there  travis cool  taliesin not that far not even that far like there yeah  liam i would like to move  across from my sister  and move forward up to  i cant tell from the overview  but a little bit of rocks right there  matt right there yeah  liam and stay hidden  matt there  liam yeah  matt all righty  marisha keyleth just says  did you find what you were /none/ looking for  matt i did actually  i discovered thordaks original intent  before the soul anchor drove him insane  and he lost sight of his purpose  well it appears that it holds  the same answer  that ive been seeking as well  so in a word yes  marisha and this is the answer to your  disease you were looking for your curse  matt perhaps  marisha im assuming  it has something to do with the soul gem  do you think you can resist  the same type of madman /none/ mentality  that thordak fell victim to  when you anchor yourself  matt still facing away you see  the shoulders shift with a chuckle  i would not dare touch such a piece  it is far too dangerous  the soul gem is destroyed  it is of no use to me  laura while that conversations going on  i want to bamf trinket out  and send him around the other way  travis to the left  matt around this way  laura with grog  matt okay have trinket  roll a stealth /none/ check if you could  laura okay  matt being a big bear  laura come on trinket  youre so quiet ooh trinket rolls a 19  travis why a stealth check  sam maybe the lair or something  laura well maybe  she doesnt know trinkets here  patrick ill move up a little bit too  matt to how far  patrick enough so that hopefully  i can get as many people  within ten feet as possible  and ideally within 30 feet  if i need to rush and attack  matt okay /none/ currently you are in a space  to get three people in your area  you could either move forward with them  or if you wish to push forward  on your own  you are currently not visible  patrick right yeah  matt okay kima is going to follow along  with grog and trinket  allura feels the lack  of magical force on this side  is going to follow  up behind you guys as well  travis im over there  all laugh  matt even with her hood up  she gives /none/ you a glance like  travis stay behind me  matt well of course i am  thats part of the reason  marisha magic grog  the magic mike sequel  matt scanlan  sam ill inch up a little still hiding  behind those outcroppings there  and then im going to call out the dog  laura ooh nice  pikes going to walk to the middle  where shes in between the two parties  taliesin ooh thats really clever  sam im going to summon the dog  i just say good doggy right  /none/ and i throw the figurine  liam posh voice hello  all laugh  laura like reginald or something  what was his name  sam i forget  we never figured out his name  we know it or something  you said it was very cryptic  marisha i did write it down  at one point in time  but im not going to look for it right now  matt the dog hops out  ill use this badger for the time being  sam you put a badger down  matt i couldnt find  /none/ an actual dog figure  marisha the badger  thats even better  liam ive got a mastiff ill donate it  matt it still works fine  sam badger doesnt give a shit  laura and then pike wants  to walk in between the two parties  so hiding behind that wall outcropping  matt okay all right at this point  the air itself is still very still  and the closer you get to this  as you approach  the smell of decay  is as overwhelming as it was  in the chasm that /none/ you crossed before  raishan continues to speak and says  you may also come to notice  a curiosity about this island  that explains  a lot of the legends around it  sadly the pressures of time  left me forgetting until i arrived  which has limited my options  i had only used the glyph once before  years ago but it is as it is  so i ask you once again  we made a deal  you rescinded on that deal  and punishment was required  you survive only by my /none/ grace  and your stubborn need  to cling to your insignificant lives  regardless i have what i sought now  and i offer you this opportunity  to leave freely  decline and you choose  your resting place here  away from your loved ones  to be forgotten  and join the undying dregs of a longpassed madmans fancy  travis somebody do something  sam maybe we should just leave  marisha keyleth steps forward again  a little bit more and says  matt you bump into the shoulders  marisha excuse me sorry /none/  i just want to i just okay  i want to keep walking up to her  as much as i can  matt okay  so you step out of the shadows  marisha yes  patrick shit ive got to follow  if i see her moving  i cant im not good with that  matt okay  travis i would also  on the other side  like to advance as far as i can  without reaching her eyeline  matt you would be about there  kima sneaks up behind you  trinket /none/ follows up behind there  and allura stays just to one side there  marisha while all this is happening  keyleth is speaking  to try and keep her attention  you know raishan  youve taught me a lot about myself  these past few weeks  arguably more  than ive learned about myself  my entire years of living  matt good im glad i could enlighten  and inspire in these final moments  marisha inspirations a word  i guess you could use  i would say more of a cautionary tale  in /none/ an odd way  i hope i never become you  all those years of long life  that some many call a blessing  im sure there are many lonely moments  and i hope in my darkest of times  i dont turn to rage and anger  and selfish actions the way you did  matt you know nothing about me child  nothing  marisha that may be true  matt she turns around for the first time  to meet your eyes  and you can see the gleam  of bright sickly yellow  /dung/ and dark deep emerald green for pupils  as she turns with a slight smile  just curling across her porcelain skin  marisha i see i have your attention  after all  matt youve had my attention  since you entered this place  you arent the subtlest of adventurers  marisha no we i mean we know  all laugh  taliesin thats what i was waiting for  thank you  marisha touche  matt so what is it youve come here  to speak on your enlightenment and die  or do we wish to /none/ maintain  the agreement we had  go our own separate ways  sam im going to really quickly  whisper to the dog  do you see anything that we dont  matt the dog looks around no  sam good doggy  marisha youre correct  we reneged on our deal  just as you did on your end  there was a mutual distrust  we knew that from the beginning  matt that makes us even then  does it not  marisha it does  but in terms of negotiation  you presented your deal /none/  so we will now present ours  laura im backing up  but im drawing an arrow  and just notching it and waiting to see  if she does anything to keyleth  matt okay  marisha my want for revenge against you  while still strong and very palpable  i now understand was ultimately selfish  only in the sense  that everyone else in taldorei  should share in the revelry  of bringing you to justice  i am not the only one we are not the only ones  who have felt the /none/ ramifications  of your destructive actions  and as much as i would like to make do  on my promise that i told you weeks ago  and end your life right now  i desperately want the rest of taldorei  to feel that satisfaction as well  so you surrender now  you come with us  under means of temporary control  we take you back to emon  maybe the fire ashari  well work that out  were going to take you  and you face trial  amongst the taldorei council the people /dung/ of the ashari  and on behalf  of the rest of the citizens of exandria  if you choose to not take this offer  then i guess we will see  whose final resting place  it will be in this cave  matt the book  that she currently had in her hands  closes in her grasp  as her eyes dont flicker or shift  or blink from your connection  she looks to you  with her chin raised a bit  marisha i mirror her  puff up a little bit  matt /none/ you act as though  the laws of the anthill  affect the foot that crushes it  you speak words of importance  but ive seen laws and people  come and go change die  turn to dust and rise again  people kill neighbor  families die from the inside and out  you see im diseased but look upon you  you insignificant creatures  you do more to your own people  than ive done in an entire lifetime  marisha that might be true  but at least that is the fate  of /none/ our own consequences  and our own doing  not some outwardly force  forcing their repercussions on us  and you should know raishan  ive stepped on plenty of anthills  in my day  those that dont die revolt  and guess what  there are some pretty nasty stings  from some ants out there  laura theyll leave a welt  youll itch for days  marisha the strength of a colony  is stronger  than the individual  of one great diseased foot  matt you are truly not intending  to leave /none/ me be are you  marisha nope  matt well that is such  an unfortunate disposition on your part  interestingly enough  and she thumbs a couple of pages  in the next book  closes it  and throws it to the side  my needs do happen to call  for a handful of powerful magicusers  and there are proper tools  within these caverns to keep you in line  so we shall call  your foolishness kismet  marisha i guess  we can say the same for yours  i guess its /none/ a matter of who wins now  matt very well  marisha im giving you one last shot  laura i hunters mark her  at 2nd level because thats what i have  matt okay  liam same  matt what do you do  liam hunters mark  marisha surrender  and if you choose not to  at least we can go forward  in our consciences  and know that we gave you a choice  matt so as you guys are casting the spell  and shes saying this  raishan responds with  i /none/ shall relish closing the final chapter  on your brief pitiful tales  and beginning a fresh new chapter  of my own  as you guys both mark  the spell has no effect  takes no root in the space  you maintain concentration  but nothing was marked  there is nothing there physical  taliesin the dog in theory  sees invisible things by the way  sam its not invisible  shes not there  marisha is she a hologram  is she an illusion  travis what are we doing  matt what are /none/ you doing  aside from rolling initiative  which i think probably would be  a good thing to do right now  so lets go ahead and roll initiative now  marisha wait  thats the dead body of thordak right  matt correct  marisha shes not possessing thordak  is she shes speaking through him  liam no the paladin checked for undead  laura i sensed three dragons  marisha oh undead thats right  patrick i wouldve probably sensed  unless theres some sort of masking  going on here  laura which shes good /none/ at  matt laughs  laura oh man i dont like hearing that  marisha lucky green lucky green come on  taliesin laughs im sorry  marisha ah if it wasnt so ironic  laura thats a bad taliesin laugh  taliesin singing its like rain  taliesin and marisha  singing on your wedding day  travis please do not sing that song  taliesin well be doomed to die  if we sing that song any further  matt so folks  initiative tracking going down now  we have 25 to 20  liam 25  /none/ laura 24  taliesin 22  sam 21  patrick jeez  marisha thank god you guys are alive  thank fuck  matt 25 24  sam 21  matt 21  taliesin 22  matt 22 all right 20 to 15  travis 16  patrick did you roll for pike  laura yeah i did i rolled for pike  she got eight pike got eight  matt pike got eight  keyleth what did you get  marisha four  matt kerrek  patrick you dont add proficiency bonus  its only a dex bonus right /none/  matt just dex bonus correct  patrick then 11  matt okay so we have  taliesin you dont add proficiency bonus  patrick thats what i was asking about  for dex for initiative rather  marisha i think thats you  because youre a fancy fighter  taliesin im weird okay  thats a weird thing  travis so keyleth got the lowest you got the lowest one  marisha and taliesin yeah  marisha i was talking  i was giving a very compelling speech  travis yeah i was writing it down  with my /none/ inability to write  matt all righty so  top of the round currently  vax what are you doing  liam and we see nothing  matt you see nothing now  you just see  the apparently notphysicallythere  humanoid form of raishan  still standing on the opposite side  liam and two eggs  matt two eggs here and the corpse  liam all right im going to cross  back across north to the  i mean i click on the boots of haste  im going to move  straight towards you matt  /none/ across the hall  so im by the corner there  matt over here  liam no not that far no closer to me  right there  and im going to throw at the eggs  matt okay  liam and its im going first  so with assassinate  i get advantage on all these  because im the first to go in combat  yes yep  matt sure  liam starting at third level  you are deadly  so you get the drop on your enemies  you have advantage on attack rolls  against /none/ any creature  that hasnt taken a turn  in the combat yet  matt okay sure  the eggs have not taken a turn  in the combat yet  liam thats great  and im going to use sharpshooter  so i get a negative five on these  travis the eggs havet taken a turn yet  matt vaxildan the egg assassin  liam yeah 21 for the first  matt that hits  liam okay  travis trailer voice this easter  the eggs have not taken a turn  matt trailer voice  prepare to /none/ be scrambled  liam laughing the second one is 18  matt 18 hits  liam okay and that is  oh thats not that good is 14  matt 14 okay  liam do they all three hit  or just the first two  matt first two  liam first two okay  so the first one gets sneak attack damage  laura those eggs dont even know youre coming  liam thats right  what you want them to take less damage  laura oh no  liam yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  matt these eggs /none/ are caught unaware  taliesin thisll be over easy  travis taliesin  taliesin im so proud so proud  all laugh  liam 32 for that one  patrick eggcellent  all groan  patrick i didnt start this  but i will finish it  liam and what the heck  im going to poison that egg  so that is laughing seven  that egg has to make a dc 15 success  against poison  all laugh  matt succeeds with a natural 17  liam so does it get half  or half right or /none/ none  i dont know  ive never killed an egg before  matt i mean it still takes  the full sneak attack damage  and it is not poisoned  liam not poisoned so give it  another seven hit points of damage from the dagger itself  matt a total of  liam seven for that second attack  the earlier one was 32  isnt dungeons and dragons fun  laura eggs you guys eggs  matt so as you rush past  and careening around the corner  throwing these three daggers  out to /none/ the side  the first one just smacks into the side  and the egg which had already  been previously damaged structurewise  by a somewhat resistant but still impactful  burst of druidic magic energy  in the previous conflict  the first dagger cuts through  like a hot knife through butter  out the side of the egg  you watch as the shell on the other side  just scatters  causing this splatter of some sort  of thick liquid against the wall  the other two daggers  one just careens off to /none/ the side  the second one that does impact  continues and causes the egg  to actually crack and fold in on itself  causing it to leak out  the side of the shell  as it collapses in on itself somewhat  sam thats one egg down  matt so that egg there  i will mark as currently  laura scrambled  marisha sunny side up  mattdestroyed  taliesin florentine  travis benedict  laura poached  matt there you go  that one is destroyed  taliesin poached  matt all right does that /none/ end your turn  liam yeah ill stick with it  matt okay next up is vex  laura thats me  im going to immediately say  over the earring  i dont think shes really there  and then try to look and see anything  any sign of her that i can spot  can i see anything  matt make a perception check  laura 30  matt 30 glancing around you in the current space  that is definitively an illusion  and in fact the way it shimmers  and you look at the /none/ books  that it was using and messing with  while you were keeping more of an eye  on the area you notice now  that the books that she dropped  just vanished  laura oh  matt it was all part of the illusion  definitely not there  but you dont see anything around you  that resembles a hidden or stealthed  dragonsized creature  laura okay  matt what else would you like to do  with your turn  laura fuck i think im going to save  im going to back up /none/ against the wall  just straight back  matt right here  laura yeah because i feel  very uncomfortable with the situation  and im going to save my attack for if thordak moves  if anything moves at all  im going to wait to attack it  matt attack it  so youre holding your attack action  in case something moves  laura yeah in case thordak moves  or i see raishan or something  matt okay cool percival  still on this back wall here  taliesin okay first things first  im going /none/ to take a shot with bad news  at the remaining egg  matt okay  taliesin so lets just do that  why are you doing that okay good  thats a 22 to hit  matt that hits  taliesin so thats ooh thats nice  25 points of damage  matt all righty the first shot hits  you see the front of the egg  spidercrack inward  like how you shot in the thordak battle  but the egg still holds firm  as you begin loading for your next shot  you watch as /none/ part of the egg  begins to crack outward  like somethings pushing out  from the inside of the egg  taliesin okay never mind  then im going to take another  okay im going to take  another sharpshooter shot at it  im going to try to hit it and kill it dead  yeah im having a weird premonition  thats making me really uncomfortable  16  matt 16 to hit  taliesin yeah  matt with its armor  that probably wont hit unfortunately  the bullet ricochets  off the outside of /none/ the hardened eggshell  and just ricochet sound  liam i dont know  if it makes a difference  i called sharpshooter on my shots before  but forgot to add  the additional ten per attack  matt you destroyed the egg  you threw them all simultaneously  at a single egg  liam okay  marisha did you add ten to yours  just now  taliesin no sharpshooter  i lose five to hit  which is why i didnt hit it but i get ten extra points of damage  im feeling like now /none/ is the time  to take this out of play  so im going to burn an  action surge right now  im going to burn an action surge  matt sure buddy  taliesin and im going to take  another shot with bad news  nerdy voice action surge  matt go for it  taliesin same thing sharpshooter shot  matt do it  travis nerdy voice  its time for an action surge  liam nerdy voice raishan  all laugh  taliesin that misses  matt ricochets off again  taliesin oh man regular /none/ shot  because fuck it  marisha thats better  taliesin that hits thats 32 to hit  i shouldve just taken it  but thats okay  well see what we do damagewise  thats not bad 22 points of damage  matt with the second shot  you tear the top half of the egg off  as it goes splattering to the side of it  you can watch as what looks to be  some sort of a very very young  primordial dragon  like the ones that you had yanked  out of the /none/ eggs before  that was trying to pull its way  out of the egg  slumps lifelessly  over the side of the egg you destroyed  sam aw youre terrible taliesin  youre so hardboiled  matt thats awful  taliesin i dont suppose i have time  to run a weird perception check do i  really quickly  do i have a moment  for a perception check  matt youve used all your action  and your bonus action  taliesin i havent burned  any movement though  matt what are you looking for /none/  taliesin is that center wall real  matt this center wall here  this would be  an investigation check  taliesin yeah im calling that 23  matt 23  glancing over across the way  best you can tell  the wall appears to be solid  and is an actual natural barrier  in the cavern  taliesin okay  just wanted to have my moment  laura oh my god  that wouldve been so smart though  taliesin i had a moment of horror like  oh god thats dragonsized okay cool  marisha /dung/ yeah thats her  it could still be her  taliesin yeah  marisha he couldve  just not rolled high enough  matt so that ends your turn at the end of percys turn  the human figure across the way  with the dark green hair gives a deep bow  laura oh no  matt and then vanishes from the field  laura no  travis that wasnt so bad  sam we won  laura good job guys  marisha we just made her leave  matt the dog turns around  and faces this direction /none/  and starts barking  sam yes yes  taliesin good boy  matt you just hear heavy footsteps  and then suddenly flapping wings  theres suddenly a torrent of wind  blowing within the area  as something  is disturbing the air quite heavily  so thats that  laura i am holding my action  until raishan does anything  i hope she attacks well no  i hope we get to attack her soon  matt thats going to be the end  of raishans turn  travis really just the sound  matt yeah /none/  you all of a sudden hear the mastiff  barking over and over again  in this direction  laura do i see did i  oh god i cant its not my turn  matt but you dont see anything  laura no did my hair go whoosh  matt a little bit  laura okay  liam its kind of always doing that a little bit though  laura i mean a little bit  matt scanlan its your turn  sam i turn to face in the direction that my dog is looking  and shitballs /none/  whos that near me back there  matt this is vex thats pike  sam okay vex i will inspire  with a quick limerick  laura oh  sam gern blanston wept and wepto his wonderful broom had been swepto  first our vex spied it  then she shanghaid it  because it turns out shes a total klepto  all laugh  matt you can take your d12 inspiration  laura bringing it back  sam and then i will balls  i want to hold my thing to  but im not going to  /none/ im going to hope this works  and the dragons coming at us  maybe im going to step forward  as much as i can  towards the sound i heard  and blow my horn of fog just everywhere  liam cant you put that drug pipe down  for like five seconds  sam dont take it away from me man  travis blow one note  sam its for tobacco okay  all laugh  matt all righty  patrick this is going to settle  a lot of bets on who vapes  matt all /none/ right so yeah  20foot radius  so you create this area here  and obscures it  so currently this whole tunnel  is just filled with fog  you have no vision  beyond the outside of it  right where you are  sam all right good  but if something comes through  it will disturb the fog correct  matt it may  sam oh shit  all laugh  taliesin congratulations  we can play laser tag now  matt all right  that ends your turn scanlan  sam yeah ill just say /none/  i think shes over here guys  and thats it  matt all right grog your turn  travis i rage and i would like to rage  matt okay  travis with my 50 feet of speed  can i try to make it to thordaks corpse  see how far i get  marisha yes yes get it get it  matt you get right up to it yeah  travis okay cool can i take  i found out that the hammer  the dwarven thrower  is a versatile weapon  matt yeah you can /none/ hold it  with two hands if youd like  travis with two hands can i take a shot  at his big stupid cranium  matt yeah  travis okay  i want to squash the watermelon  matt all right roll for it  travis oh reckless  matt sure  you didnt need it but go for it  travis oh okay come on  crit on the dead skull natural 20  matt natural 20  all laugh  travis its like a beached whale  matt how do you want to do this grog  /none/ travis i talk to the new  dwarven throwerhammer  this is the beginning  of a beautiful relationship  matt as you leap in the air  using the momentum of your leap  you smash the dwarven thrower down  onto the already partiallydestroyed  skull of thordaks corpse  the skull immediately caving inward  with the force of the blow  as it hits and curves inward  it releases this sudden burst  of heavy ash into your face  that fills your lungs  and burns your eyes and you cough  as you /none/ pull back  you try and wedge the hammer out  and as you do you can see  there is actual molten rock  still dripping  off the outside of the hammer  any sort of general normal  unenchanted metal  would probably be slightly bowing  or melting in the presence of such heat  it looks like even in its dead state  after a day of rest  thordaks corpse still maintained  some sort of internal volcanic life  as it slowly subsided  but the skull is destroyed  you see bits /none/ of the upper palate  just scattered like bone chunks  across the stonework of the floor  stopping at the outside  of one of the cages  thordaks head is thoroughly destroyed  liam jello  travis well played i have another hit  but i want to get close enough for it  with my bonus action  can i use the boots of feral leaping  to make a horizontal leap 20 feet  towards the remaining egg  patrick oh the second egg  did get destroyed  travis oh theyre all toast  matt /none/ but youre welcome to  if youd like  travis i want to leap  laura theres potentially corpses  in those cages that could be something  travis im focused on the egg  all right  laura all right sorry  travis i leap toward the eggs  matt okay how far can you leap  travis 20 feet  matt all right  travis and i have to make  a dc 16 athletics check  matt go for it  travis 18  matt all right  so you leaping sound  not as far as /none/ youd like  but that egg is staring you down  there is an unmoving  baby dragon corpse that is  youve got a date with your hammer  travis if i touch down  may i throw the dwarven hammer  at baby egg corpse  matt go for it  all laugh  travis reckless  matt yeah advantage  all your attacks are reckless man  travis yes do it again  no not quite  laura thats okay its dead  it probably hits  travis 24  all laugh  matt that hits  /none/ go ahead and roll damage  travis but this is just a d8  because its onehanded right  matt yeah  travis 21  matt plus an additional d8  because you threw it  liam i dont know  if were going to kill raishan  but we smoked those eggs  matt its part of the enchantment of the hammer  travis i think its just if its a giant  its a 2d8  yeah youre right ranged attack so thats 26 total  matt 26 total  the currentlylifeless limp corpse  of this nearlyhatched /none/ primordial dragon  whatever this new entity was  through the merger  of the power of the soul anchor  in the fire elemental plane  and thordak the ancient red dragon  this remaining dragonkin  is turned into red oatmeal  against the table  and the stone wall behind it  travis yeah start the morning right  come back from that bitches  matt well done grog  travis no were not worried about that  taliesin no youre good  laura trinkets fighting every urge  to go lick up the egg  all /none/ laugh  taliesin oh dont eat that  dont eat that no  laura come on hes a bear  travis im good  matt youre good all right  at the end of your turn  liam that hall looks dangerous  right where he is  matt lets see here  liam theres two magical columns  right there  travis those arent even there at all  matt scanlan you feel a strange  warm sensation in your chest  laura oh youve been dispelled  marisha bitch  matt also at the end of your turn /none/ grog  or as soon as your turn ends  you hear this undead inhale  strange sucking breathlike sound  travis dont do it listen  i like you the way you are dont  matt laughing make a perception check  travis oh yeah thats a fucking five  matt five you are talking fervently  at your hammer please  travis please dont look come on  in my previous relationship  ive been burned before okay  i want to start fresh  sam then i also lose my  taliesin no thats only  well /none/ that may be something else  thats beacon of hope  thats a different thing  matt thatll do it  marisha but is it still dispelled  taliesin it depends  on what she dispelled  matt the time youre focusing  on the hammer  you arent paying attention  to your surroundings  until you just see the shadows  coalescing closer to you than you expect  and by the time you look up you watch  as two black smoked wraithlike entities  that had slowly pulled themselves  out of the two cages on /none/ the sides  have shifted beside and lashed out at you  travis shrieks i scream  like im in a haunted house  all laugh  sam you are in a haunted house  marisha yeah i was just going to say  ive seen that thats legit  travis i jump like a bitch  the boots of feral leaping  are nothing yall  marisha halloween horror nights  is only fun when watching him  matt 19 to hit  travis oh that hits  matt they have advantage against you i forgot  so 19 /none/ and the other hit is two and a 22  travis both hit  matt so both hit you all righty  you suffer  21 points of necrotic damage  from the first hit  travis necrotic huh  sam you dont have anything against that  travis im going to forrest gump  up this bitch real quick  matt and 20 points of necrotic damage  so a total of  travis 42  matt 41 points of necrotic damage  travis 41 21 and 20  matt i need you to make  two constitution saving /none/ throws  patrick which i think  we have advantage on right now  travis is this a saving throw  or just a constitution  laura oh yeah well wisdom  matt you have advantage on wisdom  this is a constitution save  patrick it was from the heros feast  matt heros feast isnt constitution  its wisdom  patrick okay sorry  travis minus two to everything right  matt youre at minus two to everything  travis that is  a three minus two equals one  liam its not a natural one though  /none/ matt and the second hit  travis is an 11  matt all right so your maximum hit  points are also reduced by 41  as both of the wraiths drain the life  force out of you  their claws rake through your body  like its nothing and as they pull back  you feel the breath sucked from your  lungs  and you instinctually cough for a second  almost stumbling to one knee  as both the wraiths chuckle  at the side of your face  laura i feel like we arent taking /none/ this  seriously enough you guys  cause i feel like this could be really  bad right now  sam no no we made some good omelets  laura oh my god  matt all righty kerr  sam this is important work  liam the room was empty  matt you watched this happen  patrick oh yeah oh yeah  matt over here as well as seeing the fog cloud  suddenly fill the opposite side of the cavern  and for a brief moment youre  you feel like youre a little bit  out of /none/ your element but you click in  and your combat sense kicks in  what do you want to do  patrick this is my game right there  horrible things from beyond the grave plus  marisha what up paladin  patrick  my new boyfriend is in a  bad way so  travis thats me this guy  sam i missed one episode  travis total kerrbear  patrick ive got movement of 30 thatll  get me up there  liam playdate  matt yeah you have five ten 15 20 25  you can get /none/ right  you can go 30 and get right next to  both of them if youd like  patrick theres probably advantages  to that  matt up to you doesnt matter  taliesin theres advantages to both  taliesin and marisha theres  advantages to both  all laugh  patrick i will make one attack the one  closer to me for lack of a better choice  matt go for it  patrick 25  matt 25 hits go ahead and roll damage  patrick okay now im not going out on  a limb here /none/ thinking  that this is an undead creature  matt this in your time and youve  come across quite a few undead creatures  based on what youve walked through in this  endeavor you  while he did not see it you watched these  things rise out of the pile of corpses  that are jammed at the bottom of  each of these small cages  you have a pretty good sense that  these are undead  patrick i misjudged the scale before i  thought my divine sense was big enough  to cover /none/ this whole area  matt right  patrick so i am going to use my  paladin ability  and im going to burn a firstlevel spell  slot for my special paladin ability  matt divine smite  patrick yes divine smite  matt all righty so that is 2d8  patrick plus a d8 because theyre undead  matt undead so plus 3d8 to your  attack damage  marisha oh hell yeah  patrick yeah so  travis dammit  patrick four and then another 11 is 15  plus one more is 31 radiant damage  /none/ marisha fuck yeah  matt ooh so as you rush in  liam but hes only seventhlevel  matt from your perspective keyleth  you watch as this flash of light  and from thin air you watch armored  kerrek just streak down with his  glowingheaded warhammer and slamming  the side of this wraithlike entity  as it hits you watch as the creature  turns the radiant energy just consuming  part of its torso in the blast and it  shrieks out in pain as the radiant energy  tends to burn the side of /none/ its undead form  with a secondary flash as the divine  energy bursts outward that  you watched the wraith go from eager and  smooth to looking like its shimmering in  place and its form is  starting to shake and hold itself present  marisha keyleth just says  ive never seen a gardener do that  all laugh  taliesin landscaper  marisha laughs landscaper  patrick and i will take my second attack  matt same one  patrick yeah  matt all right go for it  taliesin jesus  patrick that is /none/ not as good now if im  coming in invisible  do i get advantage due to surprise  matt on the first strike you  wouldve yes  patrick only the first okay  so this is a 17  matt 17 still hits  patrick yay and i will burn another  spell slot  matt go for it  patrick i dont want these  hanging around  matt so weapon damage plus 3d8  liam divern smert  patrick eight 16 oh um 16 plus 13  somebody help out the english major  matt 29 /none/  liam oh good roll  patrick and 35 and just to let  you know the dusk hammer also  gives me plus 1d8 against undead  so im taking that extra one too  so those of you at home see  im not fucking around  matt yeah its actually the ability of  the weapon okay so  patrick 35 radiant  sam rothfuss  matt nice  sam op  patrick thats how we do at level  seven folks  all laugh  matt as the second strike using  the momentum of the /none/ first swing  you pull back and backhand it right  in the face  as it cuts clean through with no  resistance the wraith seems to scatter  and the shadow reforms in the space  it was but barely its like  patrick oh youre kidding me  matt youre watching as part of it is  flickering and bits of shadow  are dripping and disappearing  into the stonework behind  and its original kind of chuckling  evil hungry visage is now  this fearful oh shit look  on its spectral skeletal face /none/  travis singing my boyfriends back and  youre going to be in trouble  all singing with terrible harmonizing  heyna heyna my boyfriends back  all laugh  matt that got weird  laura that was like the addams family  version of my boyfriends back  taliesin i am so pleased that  got so awful  matt really terrible  travis somebodys cat at home just died  that was awful  marisha just exploded  taliesin i might get my socks back  im very excited  matt that ends kerreks turn  marisha they /none/ have only five hit points  we know this kitten damage  patrick when invisibility goes off  is my displacer cloak still in effect  do those things layer or  matt yeah theyre still in effect  patrick okay  matt you have three things you could  attune to and so  patrick right  matt while the ring is no longer  invisible and  patrick i know thatll be out for  a while  matt thats out for a while  but the cloak is still in effect  and your hammer is still /none/ in effect  patrick okay  liam the way that cloak goes is theyre  at disadvantage if they hit you once  then it goes away until the start of your  next round  patrick next turn  liam it keeps resetting  patrick i was mostly wondering  if i was invisible and displaced  if they can detect invisible do they see  me displaced  but lets not worry about that until it  becomes an issue  matt yeah yeah  well in this circumstance since youre  no longer  since you are /none/ visible for the foreseeable  future it wont make any difference  patrick okay  matt but if you were invisible  the invisibility would take over  theyd have disadvantage against  attacking you anyway  but theyd have to know where  you were to even try  and make an attack is how it would work  patrick okay  taliesin just somebody somewhere is  dropping the bass  matt okay so ending kerrs turn  pike feels  sam oh shit  matt a warm sensation within her chest  a familiar one  sam /none/ oh boy  matt lets see here  sam what just got dispelled  laura probably the feast  liam maybe  laura thats what happened before  matt so thats kimas turn  laura and the beacon of hope  matt kimas currently seeing these wraith like entities start rushing into the room  one two three four five  travis oh yeah this is her wheelhouse  matt she  laura oh yeah good thing we brought kima  matt  movementwise cant quite get  all the way up to where they are now  but she /none/ gets her hammer at the ready and  kimas going to go ahead and lets see  liam oh we got three paladins  matt shes going to go ahead and cast  crusaders mantle on herself  travis what was it crusaders mantle  matt crusaders mantle is the ability  while she maintains concentration  on it actually you know what  no i take that back shes going to cast  aura of vitality  which means she can use her bonus action to  heal an ally within 30 feet for 2d6 damage  laura nice /none/  matt um so she casts that on herself  shes going to seeing you damaged grog  travis yeah  matt  shes going to use her bonus  action to attempt to heal you 2d6  however your maximum hit points have  been lowered so it has no effect on you  and she realizes this as she reaches out  and grog  this bit of divine energy streaks from her hand  hits you and seems to just peter out on impact  shit and she steels herself with her weapon  getting ready for /none/ the next round of onslaught  finishing kimas turn it is now alluras turn  patrick luckily though because of pikes spell  the damage you didnt heal was maximum  travis oh thats good  liam laughs  laura yeah  sam well thats just math  laura i didnt follow any of that  liam silver lining silver lining  travis i replied in a positive way  because i didnt know any better  laura laughs  taliesin were probably going to want to  destroy those cages by the way  matt okay  marisha destroy /none/ them  taliesin i think that were going to get  more wraiths  marisha just coming out  liam did they come out of the cages  patrick they came out of the corpses in the  i think theres only one corpse in each cage  liam i think theyre like gauntlet  generators and theyre just like  taliesin quick point of order  matt yes  marisha spawners  taliesin is there like corpse soup in  those cages or is it one corpse per cage  matt you cant really see from your  perspective /none/ this far away  taliesin well fair  patrick i wondered that same thing  all laugh  matt for the sake of paying attention  go ahead and make a perception check  patrick okay  taliesin im heading that way anyway so  patrick 11ish  matt 11 its hard to tell in the low  light from the candelabra  it does look like from the view here theres  at least two corpses in one of the cages  like a pile theres one thats slumped  forward but you can see more than two legs /none/  marisha total spawn location  matt all right so for alluras turn  she is going to  patrick my god was that the gauntlet  matt walk away from this area kimas  got this she steps over to this side  knowing that with the dog barking off to  the side thats definitely a sign  that the dragons coming from  this direction  she pulls her hood back and she will cast  shes actually going to hold her action  shes going to begin casting  what would be a good one for /none/ this one  shes going to begin casting disintegrate  once something attempts to move by  liam savage  travis page out of gilmores book  matt shes going to hold that as an action  all right that brings us to pikes turn  laura pike voice yeah pike is going  to cast  travis pike voice yeah  laura pike voice yeah  liam pike voice im going to  laura pike voice im going to pikes  going to cast spiritual weapon at level four  marisha she would totally do that  laura right /none/  taliesin yeah  liam pike voice in the shape of a  matt shes putting it where  laura shes putting it right in the  middle of the hallway  matt there  laura pike voice yeah  matt all righty radiant sword appears  in the center of the air  sam right behind me  matt right behind you yeah  sam thats disconcerting  laura and then oh no its  protection scanlan  sam ah okay  laura and then shes going to use  i guess thats only within ten feet  liam /none/ can she move  laura shes going to cast light just to  create a little bit of better vision  on that pile of rocks in the middle of that  matt here  laura yeah  matt okay so its now a very bright  laura very bright  matt  area here now in the center of  the hallway all righty  laura im thinking maybe thatll help  spot raishan or something  sam sure yeah yeah great  matt that ends pikes turn  laura yeah  matt keyleth youre up  marisha okeydokey /none/ whatcha doing  taliesin i was just trying to see if i could  actually get it was giving me a problem  marisha to get it to work is that like  a stalactite  patrick yeah  marisha interesting okay  keyleth is going to move a couple closer to the wall thats shes close  matt this wall here  marisha yes two forward a little bit  going towards this tunnel  other way other way  matt other way  travis taliesin literally has the laser  pointer  marisha right theres good thats good /none/  thank you he is literally yeah  can i take my bonus action to do a  perception check and see if i can sense  any faint movements fog being moved  pebbles being kicked  matt go for it  laura gotta get a natural twenty on that  marisha 21  matt 21 okay you can see the fog cloud  there is a heavy swirling in the cloud  looks like the fog which is stationary because the magical effect of the spell  creates it within a vicinity the fog  itself is whooshing /none/ noises  and occasionally you see what looks to be almost  a big gust rapidly right at the outskirts of it  marisha i got you bitch all right  i want to do right overtop of scanlans fog cloud  i want to do faerie fire glitterbomb  matt okay  travis glitterbomb yeah  marisha glitterbomb  laura ugh so annoying  taliesin oh god its everywhere  laura jesus were never going to  get it off  marisha oh man im never going  to labyrinth again  taliesin the next three bathtubs  glitter /none/  matt as you step out of the way coming  towards the fog cloud you focus it  and you begin to bring your fingers across  to deliver the incantation of faerie fire  and you watch a sudden slow blue spark of  energy from inside the fog cloud  just within so its like a little  firework in a cloud and when it happens  your spell fizzles at the tip of your  fingers  marisha she fucking counterspelled me  sam or legendaried it away  marisha or legendaried it away  shes /none/ in the fucking cloud you guys  sam seems like it  marisha shes uploaded herself to  the cloud  liam druids going country  marisha look never forget your roots  travis going country  taliesin this is why you never upload  anything to the cloud  matt that brings us to the top  of the round  marisha yeah the cloud could get hacked  matt vax youre up  marisha its a black mirror episode  all of a sudden  liam uh shite are there still dead  things with groggy  matt /none/ correct there are two of them  flanking him currently  patrick theyre full of piss and vinegar  liam im going to attack them  im going to throw but im going to go one  dagger at the one above him  matt this one  liam yeah  matt all right  patrick i think the one on this side is  the one thats hurt most  liam on this side  patrick yeah  liam okay  patrick yeah thats the one that i  roughed up real bad  liam they were

travis dont you want to see how  /none/ much damage  liam that is 18 can i wait and see how  much damage i do  matt yeah you can roll damage  liam oh then yeah then ill just  attack one at a time  ill save that roll though for the next  so that is two plus eight is ten plus  laura is there anything standing  next to it  patrick yeah a bunch of us  liam oh grog is so its flanked  laura so its sneak

then the next two  matt go for it  liam the first one gets 18  matt 18 hits vex youre up next  by /none/ the way  liam and then the second one is a 17  matt also hits  liam okay so there it goes im  going to roll this one  thats three plus eight is 11 plus the  psychic damage has gone missing  marisha oh fuck  liam where is everything wheres  my dice 18 for the first  matt 18 damage  liam eight

slam into it and the magical effect of them manages to cause  the form to shimmer slightly with the  impact as the daggers pass through  and then vanish on the opposite side  of the room returning to /none/ your side  the creature seems to have taken a few hits but  its still strong and still swirling around grog  as grogs trying to find a way to get a bead  on it so he can smack it with the hammer  liam okay and i see that grog is in  pretty good hands with kerrek  so im going to use my movement  which is hasted  to slide around this way and crouch  ten feet in front of keyleth there

blazing bowstring  matt okay before you do that you still  have hunters mark up  laura oh yeah  matt its concentration  laura okay bramble shot isnt concentration  though can /none/ i shift it over to her  matt you can technically yeah  travis didnt your hunters mark just  disappear because she wasnt there  laura no no it was up  matt its still up its concentration  you just have to choose another target  use your bonus action to shift it over  marisha because the illusion  isnt considered a target  laura so once i its like up so once  i knew where she was i could shift it  liam so sorry since im new with  hunters mark  later i /none/ can take my floating hunters  mark and bring it over to raishan  matt eventually once you have a  bead on where she is yes  liam sweet  laura okay  matt so

can still vaguely make out the form  as she struggling sounds  laura all right im going to pull out  a sleep arrow  and do my second attack with a sleep  arrow through the blazing bowstring  matt okay go for it  invisible gives you disadvantage but  /none/ because she is currently restrained  that gives you advantage so its  just a straight roll  laura just straight 26  matt that hits  liam you will be a golden god if  this works  laura 14 plus one lightning plus  two for sneak attack so four more  and then oh and then a sleep arrow  matt whats the total damage  travis 18  matt 18  laura

youre over here watching the  egg off in the distance  and you watch her fire a couple arrows  and then rush around the corner  and you hear the slam into the ground  though you can see the fog moving  around and theres thrashing  if you wanted to /none/ try and attack something  youd have to roll a perception check  taliesin all right im making my way  along the wall anyway in that direction  so while im walking im going to see if  anything looks worth shooting at over there  matt okay go for it  taliesin perception check hey lets  call that a 25  matt 25 you can just make out the outline  of a form thrashing within the fog cloud  so yes i would allow you to take  attacks with disadvantage  taliesin im going to /none/ cast hex  matt okay  taliesin and she now has disadvantage  on strength saving throws  matt laughs okay  patrick laughs nice  taliesin yeah im being a dick  marisha strength saving throws  hell yeah  taliesin so im going to burn a grit  to cancel out the disadvantage  matt okay  taliesin better mark that  like a clever person  and im just going to try and  take a shot and see what happens  matt all right  taliesin so this is with bad news  thats a 21 /none/  matt

that shot as well  matt okay then  /none/ taliesin for fun  patrick actually does he have  disadvantage because shes bound  didnt those cancel out when she attacked  laura shes invisible though  patrick invisible but restrained  matt right so you wouldve had so  it wouldve been just a straight attack  liam so you dont need the grit  laura so you dont need to burn  the grit thats great  taliesin ill get that back later okay  matt good call thank you  taliesin so thank you thank you thats  going to make life better later so thats /none/  matt just roll damage and then pump 6d6

oh come on  taliesin you keep going ill let you  know im going to read  sam you have advantage  matt so trinket takes  liam a skillion hit points  matt so trinket failed the save trinket  would

118 points of damage  travis now is it do i halve the /none/  bludgeoning because of raging  matt you know what i believe you do yes  so you actually suffer the same eighty  laura 85 you said  matt 85  laura okay and pike got a nine  sam this is the big one  matt pike takes 118 points of damage  laura but shes fire resistant  matt right so thats true so she  takes 87 points of damage  laura all right  marisha she still up  laura shes still up  taliesin ill wait until you guys  are done  ill /none/ wait until theyre done and then  ill pop in with my reaction  travis thats the single most powerful  attack weve ever had hit right  patrick actually im really glad to hear  that because if im going to go out  travis you might as well go out with  the ace man  taliesin literally in a hail of bullets  travis that had some stank on it  taliesin im going to activate im going  to use my reaction to activate cabals ruin  im going to absorb the spell and the  /none/ damage i take is halved  and the cloak gains the number of  charges equal to the spells level  the level of the triggering shot  matt yes it does  laura wow that is a clutch  liam yeah perce  laura that is major  matt which its a ninthlevel spell  taliesin yeah i dont get all nine do i  because does the spell hold nine charges  matt the cloak holds six charges  however as you absorb the spell  the cloak flares out and actually grows  an additional six inches /none/ in length  the inside begins to sparkle with electric energy as  it pulls one of the meteors into the cloak itself  it arcs inward and vanishes into the side  it bursts behind you and the damage  is taken  but the cloak now is shimmering with a very  vibrant but continuous spark of arcane energy  laura my eyes are like  sam it awoke it awoke  matt pass this over please  laura you got upgraded  all sing  taliesin oh shit what okay so  sam exalted it says not /none/ just awoken  exalted  marisha it has ten charges in it  laura oh my god im so jealous  what do i do  taliesin so im at nine the damage  is still halved  laura what if i die without  upgrading my bow  matt the damage is still halved yeah  so you took a total of 59 points of damage  taliesin 59 points of damage okay  so im going to add 59 hitpoints to that  liam de rolo just went full peacock  he suddenly has a giant cowboy hat /none/ on  sam it says anyone who wears the

cloak  matt yes you do  taliesin okay thats awesome  sam you shouldve used that shit  taliesin its never come up  matt all right now raishan trying  so by the way  i dont think its possible for you to  have spells /none/ up  to even make the concentration saving throw on this  because of the sheer amount of  damage you took  make a concentration saving throw  percy yeah kima lost hers  sam did pike lose hers  matt pike roll a constitution saving  throw for pike  marisha you have to do over the  damage you did  taliesin thats 16 is my concentration  save  matt yeah so your  taliesin my hex  matt

immediately  revert back to the onyx figure that it was  but the impact sends it careening through  the room like a pinball  sam every time we use this dog thats  what happens  patrick imagine his life  all laugh  patrick just moments /none/ of like  explosions  travis hows it going  barking explosion  sam i think weve only brought him out  twice and hes been blown up both times  laura hes been

a vicinity i saw a claw  i saw something like  matt kind of yeah  sam i can take a shot  matt if you want to  sam yeah im going to take a shot  matt whatre you doing  sam i am going to cast lets do  bigbys hand at level six  matt okay  sam yeah  travis yeah dude /none/ yeah  sam sure  travis commitment  matt right at the outside of the radius  where the dragon is  sam i mean its probably got to punch  into the cloud a little bit to get  matt yeah but its right its right at the  cusp of where you saw the dragons form moving  sam yeah  matt okay and so at level six so for  that and youre using the punching  sam yes please  matt all righty so go ahead and roll a  d20 adding your spell attack modifier /none/  sam that was a cocked roll but ill take it  because im a man of honor and it did not work 13  matt 13 no that misses  travis was it cocked  laura but if it was cocked then it  doesnt count  sam didnt actually roll it hit the  side of my box  matt its still a roll its fine  so the fist whoosh into the fog just  manages to move past the form  does not actually hit the side of it  sam balls all right  matt /none/ does not hit balls either but  bigbys fist is up and around  sam okay good  matt all right that ends your turn  patrick oh what about the radiant weapon  did that was that a concentration spell  laura it was  patrick oh  laura oh wait no its not a  concentration no  matt yeah thats still around  laura spiritual weapons still up  matt when it comes to pikes turn  pike can still do that  patrick okay  laura yeah  matt good looking out  travis singing stay /none/ alive  matt thats going to be the end of your turn  raishan is going to use two legendary actions to  taliesin burn em baby  marisha how many does she have  taliesin too many  matt four per turn  marisha four per turn jeez  matt is going to go ahead and cast  disintegrate at pike  laura what disintegrate whatd he say  liam disintegrate toward pike  laura no  taliesin no  laura no  sam is that bad  laura please tell me thats a natural one that  you /none/ just rolled and youre taking a picture of it  marisha i know right yeah  matt im taking a picture of it right  now  travis throw the laser pointer over here  taliesin he somehow rolled a 46 and theyre  trying to figure out what to do about it  travis laser pointer  taliesin laser pointer  liam pass it  taliesin okay fine  matt im checking to make sure this is  how the spell works  travis blind him blind him  matt this is going to be really funny  dont /none/ blind me im trying to help  travis take the shot  taliesin i have the shot  matt oh has to make a dexterity saving  throw so that roll wouldnt matter  i rolled a one but it doesnt matter  because its not an attack  dexterity saving throw on pike please  liam fuck  laura i dont want to roll it its too  much pressure  marisha can we just pretend that one  was like a nat 20 for pike  liam ill roll it one of us has to roll it  /none/ heres what it is this is what it is its a 14  laura 14  matt total 14 thats not enough  patrick is she by anyone with the paladin  radius we got a bunch of pallies here  laura shes not by any of the paladins  matt uh you know what actually allura  is conscious on the ground  allura is going to attempt to counterspell  that that is a sixthlevel spell  cause alluras going to try and get that  out at the last minute so  laura with disintegrate does the /none/ body  go away i dont understand  liam yeah  travis yeah it aint good  taliesin will the armor retort that  or no  sam yeah the armor brings her back  to one point doesnt it  matt okay fourth or higher dc equals  10 plus the spell level  alluras spell modifier is five so  that is an eight thats not enough  she rolled an eight plus five thats not  enough to counter the spell  okay so that goes to pike suffers so thats 72 points of force damage  /none/ laura well shes knocked unconscious  but the armor should bring her back  matt pike as the beam hits her you  watch her flesh begin to turn to dust  as the fingers begin to disperse as a  burst of flame from the armor flares outward  bringing her back to her feet at whatever  the effect of the armor is so she gets up  sam is it five  liam she gets like one hit point i  think  travis whats the effect of the armor  laura the effect of the armor /none/  liam shes up shes up shes not dead  laura brings her back to five hit points  matt i had forgotten she had that  laura and shes on her feet  matt so shes on her feet  laura is no raishans not within  15 feet of her is she  matt no  laura okay  liam okay shes

couldnt do  matt correct well its attack disengage  or dash i think it should say on the card  liam yeah it says the extra action can be  used /none/ to attack dash disengage or hide  shite so im going to balls  im going to go to the gnome on the  ground and im going to cast lay on hands  laura which one  liam pike is up isnt she  matt pike is conscious  liam conscious is what i mean  to scanlan  matt there you go  liam and one hit point just to  get you up  matt youre conscious  sam is this my urine or someone elses  patrick someone peed on me  while i was dead /none/  all laugh  travis laughing is this my urine  or someone elses  sam i dont know which is worse  taliesin only one way to find out does  it taste like anything youve had recently  sam asparagus thats me  matt oh

the firestorm  liam maybe ill even /none/ go ten more feet forward  matt okay you slam into the physical  form  liam vow of enmity  matt okay  liam as a bonus action  matt all righty  liam and i will use the extra action to  disengage and get the fuck out  matt okay  taliesin whoa  marisha whats that whats that  whatd you do  matt back up how far  liam im going to go that way back  towards scanlan  matt this way okay  liam i should have 60 feet of  movement hasted /none/  matt yes and as you back up  liam disengage  matt yeah disengage yeah  patrick nicely done  liam i will actually go along the wall  matt so youll be like over here  liam yeah yeah  matt okay all right that ends your  turn vex youre up  laura okay im going to jesus christ  im going to run over to allura and im  going to cast 3rdlevel cure wounds on her  matt okay healing her  laura 3d8 plus three fifteen points  matt all right  laura and /none/ then 30 feet no fuck  thats my action isnt it  matt mmhm  laura i guess as a bonus action im  going to hide im such a loser  matt so youre going to move over  here and hide  laura yeah i guess  matt okay so go ahead and roll a  stealth check  laura okay let me see if i have any  health potions left though  i have a regular healing potion left  matt go for it  laura so im going to take that  matt its 2d4 /none/ plus two  laura ooh eight points healed  matt all right percy youre up  laura and a stealth check  matt stealth check yes  taliesin do i still have any theory of  where she is  or do i have to roll another perception  check  matt i mean just where she was  previously standing  patrick he just bumped into something  liam yeah you wouldve seen me go  taliesin so yeah again as im scootching  further and further back along the wall  im going to pull out the animus /none/ box and  take a few shots in there to see what happens  matt okay disadvantage on all these  strikes because she is invisible  taliesin because she is invisible  liam get it nerd get it  taliesin yeah im going to burn a grit  for the first one to neutralize that  laura can i not have gone back behind the  stalagmite i want to go around the corner  yeah like that  matt thats as far as you can get  unfortunately  laura okay thats fine i rolled a 16  /none/ taliesin so shot number one natural 20  matt is this with disadvantage or did  you use the grit point  taliesin i used the grit point to cancel  out the disadvantage  matt you did all right all right  roll some damage  taliesin and that will not affect the  cabals ruin damage i was going to add to it  because thats a different thing right  matt um  taliesin because that seems unfair  because i can add that later  matt yeah adding that to a crit is a  little /none/ intense id say no  taliesin okay im just going to add  the standard damage  im not going to crit the cabals ruin  damage but im adding  matt correct  liam the dragon doesnt blow up  taliesin thats a thing  matt the benefit is you can choose  to apply it after the hit  taliesin after the hit  matt the downside is you cant  add it to the crit  taliesin totally worth it  matt so you never waste it  taliesin no so thats lets see  thats six /none/ points of psychic damage  matt all righty  taliesin and 18 points of normal damage  matt so 24  taliesin and then im going to add  three points of cabals ruin which is  sam whoa  taliesin 14 points of lightning damage  matt 38  taliesin yep  sam does all that double because  it was a crit  taliesin no no that is doubled  matt thats 38 points to that first hit  shes going to make a concentration check  taliesin and i also get my grit point  back because /none/ i critted  matt its true  laura i think its time for some advil  all laugh  laura critical role brought to you  by advil  matt fails the concentration check  on the invisibility  taliesin yes  matt is going to spend another legendary  resistance to succeed it  marisha so shes spent two  matt shes spent two  laura thats good thats good  taliesin thats fine now for my second  shot im going to spend a second point to  oh shes not visible shes  matt correct she maintained /none/  concentration  sam did she blink into visibility  matt no  taliesin so i still have disadvantage  so i still need to  matt you do  taliesin okay thats fine  matt are you doing another grit  point to cancel it  taliesin yep  matt all right  taliesin not quite as good but  still good 27  matt 27 hits  taliesin so thats ooh thats nice  thats 17 points of normal damage  matt all righty  taliesin two points of psychic damage  matt okay  taliesin and ten /none/ points of lightning  damage  matt all righty  taliesin for my next shot  matt natural 20 on the save so she  saves concentration its maintained  taliesin im doing the same thing again  so im at two grit points  marisha kill that resistance kill that  legendary resistance  taliesin im trying  marisha come on percy  taliesin not going to hit thats going  to be 19 to hit that doesnt hit  matt no  taliesin so that one misses i still have  three cabals ruin though so thats nice /none/  im going to use my bonus  action for a heal surge  for my little healing my little  pickmeup  matt great  taliesin so thats going to give me  back 16 points of healing points  so thats 16 to me so thats  105 im at 105  and im going to keep just scooting  back along the wall  i want to keep where im shooting in my  line of sight but i just want to get there  yeah and still on the wall  matt okay gotcha that ends /none/ your  turn percy  taliesin yeah  matt all righty  marisha good turn man good turn  taliesin thank you thank you thank you  matt it is now raishans turn  sam oh balls  matt lets see here  taliesin look every time i have a reaction  i can do something thats crazy this is mean  patrick can i see that  matt uh hm raishan is fed up with this  whole downthenup downthenup yoyoing  travis good flee do it again  matt raishan scanlan as youre on  the ground  /none/ just getting your bearings back to  consciousness  you watch as your head is across the  ground the rocks kind of impact sound  and something seems to hit the  ground right next to you  raishans going to do a full round of  just physical attacks on you  sam great it wont take very much  since ive got the one hit point  but maybe my 14 ac will protect me  matt you are prone so attack rolls on  you have advantage within five feet  which is good because the /none/ first  attack was a one  and an 18 plus so the first hit which  is its bite hits you for 13 plus eight  sam i mean im unconscious now  taliesin do you have any reactions  you can do  sam i dont know i cant remember  when the last time i used a reaction was  was it this round or the round before  matt round before  laura so you could  matt well your turns next so you  have used it no youre right it was  it has /none/ been since the last time  so yeah it was an 18 to hit  liam this could be the difference  between  marisha yeah life and death  liam because one or two death saves  three death saves  sam all right  laura because a full round is four  attacks or three attacks  matt for raishan you dont know  laura i bet its four attacks  liam this is down to the wire dude  laura this could be it scanlan  marisha yeah do it do it  do all you can /none/  sam okay ill say to raishan this time  you so dumb when thieves stole your  horse you chased them down and said  you forgot the saddle  all laugh  matt he utters with a weak breath on  the floor of the necromancers sanctum  laura these could be scanlans  final words  matt go ahead and roll a d12 please  marisha come on scanlan  sam six  matt so its 18 minus six is a 12  all cheer  matt so whoosh  marisha you did it with your shitty /none/  retort  sam now just three more attacks  to dodge and ill be okay  liam that was the bite wasnt it  matt theres two more claw attacks  laura raishan gets four attacks  so if you wouldve failed that  your instant death save wouldve failed  matt so thats 21 to hit  sam oh thatll hit sure  matt so with that you take 4d6  plus eight  taliesin lets just call it  matt yeah youre unconscious  and the final claw attack has advantage  which hits you and its /none/ a crit so you  lose two death saving throws  taliesin were going to have to deal  with that very very quickly  travis where are you can you point  to him on the map  sam im the pink one  matt right there and the impact seems  to be coming from this area here  sam so wait they can see my body  sort of like moving  matt yeah getting hit on the ground  marisha we can see him getting  beat the shit out of  matt getting mangled by /none/ something  thats not currently there  and then whooshing sounds the wind kicks  up as something seems to shift the air  laura can anybody feel it flying past  matt you can feel it move in this  direction  laura great  matt with that yeah i can just make it  through without an attack of opportunity  liam yeah can i do an attack of  opportunity as it flies by  travis yeah im right there too  matt you sense it not far enough from  you to be able to  /none/ attack something with an attack of  opportunity  liam all right  matt that ends raishans turn  scanlan death saving throw  laura oh my god oh my god  sam three  matt and with that the breath escapes  scanlans lungs the smile across his face  as life leaves his form  sam this time i died with a bad joke  and piss all over me  all laughing  matt he died as he lived hard or after  a bad joke with piss all over him  all right that ends scanlans /none/ turn  grog youre up  travis yeah uh dragon moved  scanlan dead raspberry  did i detect which direction el dragon  flew in  matt roll a perception check  travis yeah sure three  matt youre not entirely certain  you just saw something whoosh through  the air in this vicinity  travis i am just going to throw a hammer  in that direction  matt okay  travis in there  matt roll with disadvantage  travis yup can i make it reckless  matt sure  travis one roll does that zero /none/ out  the disadvantage  matt yep  travis okay  matt she has a higher ac because shes  technically heavily obscured  travis right 27  matt 27 27 just hits you got lucky and  just flung it out in the middle of nowhere  because of the ac bonus of her being heavily  obscured so yeah go ahead and roll damage  travis nice thats good  patrick now you have a better idea of  where she is  travis yeah can i keep track of  where it hit her  liam can /none/ we all see the hammer fly  through the air  matt you can see the hammer  impact somewhere  and you watch it somewhere right up here  laura great  matt like right above you  travis 23  matt 23 damage  travis 23 damage  matt okay maintains concentration  hammer comes back  travis can i be thrilled that i hit  something that i didnt see  and smash the titanstone knuckles  together to enlarge  matt sure with that your hammer  grows in size as well  travis can i /none/ try and throw the hammer  again  matt you can  travis at the same general area one roll  unless i know where she is now but i doubt that  matt i mean youre still at  disadvantage on the attacks  but youre going reckless so its all just straight hits  travis thats a one so im no  matt on both with reckless  travis i thought i couldnt see her so  it was disadvantage  reckless advantage so just a single  matt oh right yeah misses past breaks  into the /none/ rock and stone off the wall  travis thats better 31  matt that hits  travis okay 18 26 plus four for  enlarged 25 25 damage  matt 25 damage  travis yeah yeah im freaking  out right now  matt she fails her saving throw  concentration  no she wants to maintain that spell  so thats her last legendary resistance  marisha yeah grog yeah  matt but she maintains concentration  on the invisibility so that was 25  travis 25 i think  matt yeah i got it so thats the end /none/  of your turn grog  travis yes it is  matt okay you can move if youd like  you just threw its all you did  travis oh right yeah im going to  move in the direction that she flew  matt something hits your head as  you get about there  travis ah i get angry again  matt all right that ends your turn grog  at the hm yeah at the end of your turn  travis not a word not a word  nervous laughing  matt its going to go ahead /none/ and  sam surrender  laura she surrenders  matt its too close now  yeah just were done  liam sorry sorry im sorry so sorry  patrick did we mention that this  is all subduing damage  matt laughs  patrick so glad you got that joke  matt ah subdual damage back in the day  taliesin it was a kinder gentler world  matt i know shes not going to  use that ability yet  instead is going to oh everyones  kind of moving around her  taliesin id give money for a /none/  popcorn grenade right now  matt okay you know is going to use two  legendary actions to use a wing attack  travis two legendary actions  matt so the wings start  beating furiously in the air  i need vax kima grog and vex to  make a dexterity saving throw  travis minus two because  yeah but advantage  matt wow allura actually made it  sam vex coughs inspiration  laura doesnt matter  sam what  matt that is a shitty roll  all right so  liam 27  matt 27 /none/ so  liam zero  matt you take no damage vex one  you take 13 points of bludgeoning  damage and you are knocked prone  sam are you still alive  laura im still alive you guys  sam wow  laura still standing im not  standing still  matt allura succeeds and takes  no damage grog whatd you roll  travis 17  matt 17 grog you also you take 13 points  of bludgeoning damage and youre knocked prone  travis halved halved  matt yes  travis six  laura did you say /none/ 21 points of damage  matt 13  laura oh thats it 13  matt yep and the dragon moves  half its flying speed  liam is it close ah  matt yeah just moves away at  taliesin do i get an attack of  opportunity  matt people who are not prone yes  so vax you get to make an attack of  opportunity with disadvantage  liam oh okay  laura oh damn it sucks that you  were knocked prone  travis i know  liam im going to use one luck  matt /none/ okay  liam what does that mean if i use luck  disadvantage and then i rolled a six and  matt your vow of enmity gives it  advantage though doesnt it  liam say again  matt your vow of enmity  liam thats right it does so that cancels out  so the first one but im still using luck  so the first one was a six the  second one was a 31  matt 31 hits yeah  laura yay  travis hit him  sam her  laura hit her  travis her /none/  liam nine plus psychic damage ten 25  matt 25 points of damage  patrick one more  travis kill all the other dice  matt yeah maintains concentration  and pulls away  taliesin do i get an attack of  opportunity  matt no she hasnt moved past you  taliesin she has not moved past me  matt nope all right that ends that turn  kerrek youre up  patrick im assuming yeah ive got  to be hearing that over on that side  matt yeah youre hearing all the impacts  the slashing /none/ the battle on this side  patrick okay boy 30 move i can  dash right  matt you can yeah as an action so  you can do twice your movement  patrick oh so you just its a movement  and then i burn my action to do another movement  matt correct yeah  patrick how far over does how far  over does 30 get me there  matt 30 would just get around the  corner here  patrick can i get 25 and just  actually i dont know shes invisible  so i /none/ go dragons coming around the  corner  i want to hang at the corner and  then effectively wait to attack  matt so youre holding your action in  case something shows up that you can hit  patrick yep well actually im going  to be around this corner  waiting for it to come into this  matt right there okay  patrick gosh i think  i think thats all i got  matt okay all right that ends  kerreks turn lets see here  kima sees you doing this and is going to /none/ go  ahead and back you up right there sorry percy  taliesin yeah  matt spiderclimb makes you so easy  to knock over kima on her turn  is going to use aura of vitality again on  herself and utilizing that as a bonus action  is going to heal you for 2d6 kerrek so  oh not bad 11 hit points all righty  that ends kimas turn allura  allura who is barely conscious with 15  hit points is going to get to her feet  perception check natural 20  marisha allura is /none/ bae  all laugh  matt and is going to no not  thirdlevel  shes going to go ahead and cast  a fifthlevel dispel magic  marisha yeah yeah yeah  matt which would yeah its  just dispelled and with that  laura finally  matt finally revealed on the field  laura and shes just like covered in  blood shes just so beatup  marisha yeah shes barely hanging on  liam shes looking pretty rough  marisha shes got a single tear  coming from her eye  laura oh god shes like right /none/ there  taliesin nervous exclamation  liam look out perce  taliesin i get the idea  liam put a counterweight  matt further over just appears right  in front of your face percival  laura just her butt  matt menacing growl wingsounds  and then allura using the rest of her  movement is going to here here here  and then actually misty step over here  next to keyleth to get out of the area  breathing hard keyleth you have  to finish this  marisha okay  matt thats going to end alluras /none/ turn  pike is up  laura pike okay  marisha is she still unconscious  laura no shes up shes going to stand  up and if she uses her sprinters boots  can she run over to scanlan and cast  revivify would she be able to get to him  matt she would just get to his side  yeah  laura okay then shes going to  cast revivify on scanlan  matt all right so go ahead and roll  a d20 and add her wisdom modifier  taliesin do you also have inspiration  /none/ still  laura pike didnt have it  taliesin no pike oh okay  matt he died twice the dc is 12  laura so  liam plus her wisdom whatever you  roll plus the wisdom  matt yeah so d20 plus five  laura small voice nine  matt nine okay  travis what  matt so the revivify fails reaches out  and doesnt hit  laura god fucking damn it  matt youre still dead  youre not permanently dead but you cannot  be revived for the remainder of this battle  you can only /dung/ use a ritual to return and  the dc does go up to a 13  taliesin okay okay  sam ritual of return  taliesin its the lastditch  sam okay  matt currently you get  pike touches and releases the  energy of the spell into scanlans body  and you feel the necrotic essence of  this necromancers sanctum  the very dark nature of this place  is preventing the connection between the  spirit and the body of scanlan at the moment  the spell having no effect pike still  has a bonus /none/ action if shed like  laura shes going to throw sacred  flame at raishan  matt okay  laura and thats at 17th level  which shes at now right  matt sacred flame is an action  laura it is  matt needs to be a bonus action  unfortunately  laura balls great tight she  can she do like a heal  matt she can do a healing word  laura healing word tight shes  going to do that on herself then  matt level two  laura sure  matt all right so 2d4 /none/ plus five  laura 11  matt 11 all righty so that heals  her up  patrick god if i can just fucking get  close enough to stick one on her  taliesin im going to get stupid so  marisha i know samesies  matt all right that ends pikes turn  keyleth youre up  taliesin well things have gotten  simpler  marisha okay hearing alluras words  and seeing scanlan down  can i get a movement to where i can get over  here and see her keep going keep going  matt /none/ you can see her there  marisha i can see her there  matt yes  marisha im assuming shes within  150 feet of me  matt yes  marisha this is kind of like a hail mary  oh jesus fuck all right  i am going to cast laughs my one 8thlevel  spell and im going to attempt to feeblemind her  patrick oh shes used up all her  legendary saves  marisha exactly exactly  matt all righty and it is an  intelligence saving throw  laura oh shes really smart  marisha /none/ yes which shes really good at  but we could get lucky  matt four plus four rolled a four  she has an intelligence modifier of four  and it is not one of her saving throws  marisha shut up  matt her intelligence and charisma  become one  cannot cast spells cannot activate  magical items  patrick up top up top  marisha oh my god oh my god  oh my god  travis did that really happen  did that work  matt yeah  sam its permanent right for 30 days  /none/

natures energy  begin to spill out of the cracks in the vicinity /none/  marisha and i just say melora come  on girl come on melora  matt you watch as raishan chuckles one of the  tendrils lashes out and wraps around the throat  and as they wrap and begin to strengthen  around the neck  pouring into the cracks of the flesh where  the disease currently holds her throat  her brow begins to sink the jaw hangs  open  and slobber begins to drip from her jaw  as raishan just as opposed to speaking  now does a guttural heavy breaths and  growling /none/  liam poetic justice motherfucker  travis still

that ends your turn  percy  taliesin anything i can do with my  bonus action no  sam drink something  patrick before she goes because im  not familiar with the hold action rules  i was waiting around the corner for the  dragon to show up  matt correct its not in range to you  the moment the dragon comes into range  you can strike  patrick okay so thats the deciding /none/  factor  matt correct  patrick  even though she showed up  i cant finish my move that i delayed  matt unfortunately with the fifth edition  rules they make it so its like a quick reaction  patrick okay  matt however the dragon does fly past  to get around the edge to this side here  laura god shes just going after percy  she had a crush on you man  taliesin i no she may vaguely  remember that i was not cool  travis you tried to kill her yeah  /none/ liam in this state shes just going to  mount you  matt you do get to make your attack as  she comes into range flying past for you  patrick oh okay thats all i need

sorry  patrick mother fucker i miss with  both got no juice to throw on it either  matt first swing just goes wide the  second one hits the side  but you havent hit hard ancient dragon  hide before and it scrapes across the outside  with no noticeable damage and a little seed  of fear wells in your heart once more  patrick yep thats okay i got to use these  actions that were going to be wasted /none/ anyway  matt all right as raishan slams down  onto the ground  patrick was she holding action  alongside me  matt no she cast a spell to heal you  last turn as a bonus action  patrick okay  matt raishan is going to unleash  upon you percy  who has avoided the meteor swarm who  has shot her in the face  and right now in her feral state is just  focused on whats closest and angry at her  taliesin okay yeah all right  matt first strike that is a /none/ 26 to hit  taliesin oh jesus how is this happening  matt with the bite that is 17 plus  eight 25 points of piercing damage  taliesin oh

critical thats two death saving  throws  patrick a critical  matt percy youre dead  taliesin im out  matt as the bite knocks you to the ground  the claw slams down onto your torso  and just tears out the side of your body your  entrails scattered across the stone floor  sam youre up laura roll good  matt  and your breath just escapes out  kerrek you and kima both there /none/ watch  this happen  as percy is now partially spread across  the stone immediately to the right of you  taliesin the blood is in fact blue  matt and raishan gets her legendary  actions back  thats going to end raishans turn  grog youre up  travis yeah grog would like to get up  liam stand up  travis what does that take for me  to do that  matt thats half your movement 25  travis half my movement can i use the rest  of my movement to run towards dragondick /none/  marisha towards dragondick  travis yeah  matt 25 thats as far as you can get  travis can i use the boots of feral  leaping to leap even further  matt make your athletics check  travis okay  laura wait a minute did she even roll  to break her grasping vine  matt grasping vine doesnt keep her restrained  it just grabs somebody and pulls them there  its meant to move things  travis natural 20 on that one  marisha natural 20  travis yeah on my leaping  all laugh  /none/ marisha well i mean thats still cool  travis i leap through her chest boom  liam pacman through it  travis yeah so i have my three attacks yes  matt yes youre not in melee you  didnt quite get far enough to get  travis imma have to throw em reckless  not negated because i can

minutes a long time  taliesin ten rounds  laura shes got little legs  marisha matt gets weird about the  minute rule just keep that in mind  i think the sooner you do it the easier  taliesin yeah i know  travis 26 for the third one  taliesin matt does get weird about the  minute /none/ rule that is also funny  sam right now scanlans getting fed grapes  by little cherubs that are the same size as him  all laugh  sam and hes like come on percy weve  got red and green grapes  matt all right that ends your turn  grog  laura like the ultimate punishment for  scanlan is he would show up  as a spectral servant in somebody elses  mansion  sam oh god  travis no the last one i rolled a one  on the damage  i reroll ones or twos /none/ with that first  thing of fighter  sam you want what oh all right  matt thats for the larger weapon  ill doublecheck real fast  travis yeah i dont remember what  the number was anyway  matt well here just to remind myself  the weapon a melee weapon youre  wielding with two hands  which as youre throwing it youre not  travis thank you  matt so no all right got it that ends  grogs turn kerrek youre up  patrick oh please please just let me  all i want to /none/ do is stick at least one on  this god damned dragon  marisha come on kerrbear  liam yes  patrick okay so there is 26  matt 26 hits  laura yeah  patrick and a 20 im guessing the 20  matt 20 misses unfortunately  patrick unless this dragon is so surprised  that i finally made a successful attack  all laugh  matt no unfortunately  the feral angry unintelligible state of  raishan right now as just a beast no  not surprised instinct now  patrick so im going to burn my /none/  secondlevel spell for smite  and she is not anything that is  specifically affected by doomhammer here  shes not undead technically or  matt no  patrick just regular old evil  matt yeah  patrick okay  marisha regular old evil  taliesin shes just awful  marisha classic evil  patrick just just bad so thats  ten 18 one more 28  matt 28 points of damage  patrick 28  travis she dies suddenly  a cardiac arrest  matt at a max hit points of 520  how do you want to /none/ do this  screaming and cheering  matt literally had seven hit points  left as far as my math goes yeah  liam level seven  matt i cant fucking believe i cant  fucking believe that happened  laura kerrek just like leveled up  to like  matt so how do you want to do this  laura oh my god  marisha oh my god kerrek  matt the feral beast there tearing  the innards out of percy on the ground  grog slamming into it just seemingly  bashing against the world  watching /none/ everyone drop around you  like flies your warhammer in hand  patrick what i would like to do is step over to  be over his body and its like no no further  and as the dragon is coming in just trying to  mindlessly claw at this poor destroyed corpse  i like to think of the anime slowmo  strike  where the hammer comes back and  it slows down  and then when it connects you get  the big starburst  wow okay  matt as the hammer arcs downward  slowmo sound /none/ effects  it just slams into the snout of raishan  just as the head turns up  the eyes that were once reptilian and  intelligent  are now just filled with bloodshot rage  and feral intensity  the jaw is attempting to snap up and  catch the blade however youre too fast  your old adventuring reflexes are kicking  in  as the glowing hammerhead comes down onto  the snout the divine energy blasts forward  and you watch as the dragons face  explodes inverting inward  the front of the skull being /none/ blown backward  and you guys watch as this flash of light  fills the entirety of this necrotic space  this one plume of radiant smoke kind of pssssh  and left behind you see kerrek standing  there holding the rod  the actual head of the hammer now dismissed  as part of the burst of radiant energy  and there the smoking ruin of the throat  headless of raishan the diseased deceiver  collapsing to the ground unmoving  and were going to take a quick break  take a break  and were going /none/ to take a little time to  take in the aftermath of this moment  before we finish tonights episode so  well be back here in a few minutes  were going to go ahead and use the  restroom well see you guys here shortly  travis oh my god  marisha holy shit  break  matt and welcome back so  last we left off the battle with raishan  ended with a victory for vox machina  but at a rather high cost at the moment  as you stand now in the still silence /none/  the aftermath of the fray looking down  seeing your allies beaten bruised disheveled  scanlan lifeless on the ground on one  side of this cavern  and a partially gutted percy lifeless on  the other  the smoldering ruin that was once the head  of raishan lifeless and still on the ground  as kerrek clutches the hammer  kima walks over  and grabs your shoulder and tightly  squeezes it going  you did what had to be done thank you  patrick i mean ive been around  i cant help him /none/ can i  matt i think hes beyond either of our power  now allie please tell me shes alive  and kima runs off realizing that she doesnt  really know the status of the rest of the group  allura shouts out to her on the side  laura whats happening  matt im all right  patrick i get down there and im doing  im doing useless combat triage  matt trying to gather what you  patrick you do what you can  matt whats outside putting it back in  yeah  patrick and /none/ ive yeah  laura vax  liam yeah  laura are you up  liam yeah yeah  laura good percival how are you  marisha sound off if youre alive  travis alive  liam i start stumbling over towards scanlan  marisha percy  laura percy i go running around  the corner  marisha same  matt as you guys both kind of run  keyleth a bit behind  vex you turn and you see raishans  corpse just piled  and then on the ground you see kerrek  slowly and methodically  almost staring /none/ off into a memory  trying to gather a bit of percivals  scattered innards from the side torn open  laura no no and i run over to him  help him pike  matt pike comes running around the  corner oh god  and she runs up real fast and begins  gathering her revivify spell  travis whwheres scanlan  liam i pick him up i start walking  towards grog with him  matt did either of you guys want to  roll for pikes revivify  liam on percy  laura on percy  /none/ matt percival yeah  travis do you want matt to do this so  that theres no  laura i  liam ill do it i dont want you to have  i dont want you to  get out of your head ill do it ill do it  ill do it its just dice its the universe  thats low  laura oh no is that a five  liam plus six  laura plus what its not going to work  matt six plus five  laura eleven  matt percival has died how many times  /none/ laura i dont know  marisha once  matt i think just once for him right  liam the big one  marisha it works it works its just  enough its just enough  travis wait how many times has he died  matt were doublechecking taliesin  travis taliesin how many times  have you died  taliesin does the necklace count or does the necklace not count  matt the necklace does not count  taliesin once as far as i can remember  laura cause the necklace just instantly  bamfed him back  matt yeah /none/ similar to the effect earlier  liam yeah its a shield  marisha oh come on come on  patrick if thats going on ive got like  30 points of lay on hands  just that i have not had a chance to use  and im probably not in great shape  im probably going to be trying to use  it even though i know better  matt so as youre trying to grab the body  and trying to make it form its not  its not doing anything and the healing magic is  not /none/ taking effect into the nowstill cold body  as pikes metallic hand comes into your  visual frame kerrek  you watch in that slow breathless motion  as her gauntleted arm reaches down  and touches the clavicle of the bloody  mess of percys torso  and as the divine energy pulses warmth  once more through the chest  you watch as the bits of exposed organ  that you had pushed in close over with skin  breathes and breath comes back to percivals  body you come to consciousness barely  taliesin quick question  /dung/ matt yes  taliesin okay just checking okay  good to know  laura i just kisskisskisskiss  tearstearstearstears  taliesin oh thats nice  laura welcome back dont look down  youre a bloody mess  taliesin panicked laughter oh is this  mine  marisha no  taliesin okay im going to pass out  travis are we all here then  liam grog  laura scanlan was down  marisha scanlans down  travis i take off running for vax  matt okay as you turn around the  corner  liam ive got him in my /none/ arms

certain skillset and  its not this kind of skillset im sorry  marisha vax the raven queen you  can talk to her right vax  travis i mean what do we need do  we need like  marisha okay we have to get

form a circle  taliesin i am lying down to do this but  yes  matt she closes her eyes she begins  the incantation under her breath  travis why did he roll  laura why is she rolling  matt /none/ theres a brief flux of arcane energy  and then it fades and you all remain in place  travis fuck  marisha no  matt she goes um  marisha whats wrong  matt i dont know something is  something is barring my  patrick its this place the dragon said  that there were features to this place  marisha oh fuck we dont have  patrick kerrek has no affect in his  voice  travis we have to get out of here  patrick up and out  marisha up and out up and out /none/  laura pikes going to cast detect magic  and see where its coming from  can she see if its coming from anywhere  matt okay she casts detect magic there  are a number of magical sources in this room  there are a few vials on the back shelf  some of which appear to have been broken  and scattered on the ground and the  magic is fading  there is one book that is actually in a  chest that she goes and partially opens  there is a book inside that is emanating /none/  some magical essence  there is the doorway across the way  but there is just a general magical presence  like a faint magical energy everywhere in here  marisha which doorway across the way  matt on the far end  patrick there is a doorway  travis oh there is  marisha i run over to inspect it  matt make an investigation check  marisha try and get us out of here  perception  matt investigation  marisha oh jesus fuck  taliesin what hit points am i at right  now  marisha /none/ seven  matt seven the door looks like the door  doesnt look like its particularly intricate  marisha trapped or anything  matt it looks like its locked or chained  by something  marisha vax can you check for traps  liam grog  travis yeah  laura im going to thirdlevel cure  wounds you  liam take him take him  taliesin what am i at right now  laura youre probably at one  taliesin okay thatll do  laura so im going to cure wounds on you  liam all right i head over /none/ to where  keyleth is and start looking for traps  patrick can i lay on hands with him once  hes back  matt you can now okay  liam im going to use my last luck of  the day  patrick so i can give you ill give  you 30  taliesin thank you  liam i just used my last luck of the  day and i got two ones  matt two ones  marisha are you fucking serious  matt the door seems not trapped but it appears  to be chained or /none/ locked from the other side  travis fuck that shit titanstone  knuckles im going through the door  matt all right  liam give him back give him back  matt all right roll a strength check  travis with advantage thats good 26  liam but its not trapped i checked it  laura 24  matt 26 punching sounds you start  slamming your fists against the door  and as it splinters and then breaks  inward and then outward  and rocks just start tumbling outward where  once was the door in this vicinity /none/ here  now appears to be a cavein on the  opposite side  marisha augh i do my stone shape and  i just punch the walls  and try and blast a hole through the  fallen rubble with stone shape  matt okay as you slam through you smash a  cylindrical space in and it just meets more rock  you get the sense that whatever chamber  was beyond this room  marisha is just a cavein  matt  has just caved in  taliesin im going to say something  awful put him /none/ in the bag of colding  its not like hes breathing it will  keep him safe lets gather what we can  we have to walk out of here theres no  other way  laura pike looks at the book thats emanating  magic does it look like its an evil book at all  matt it has a sinister look to it  it is ancient the leather itself is darkened  not by initial color but by just weather age  it has a very very deep leatherybrown  burgundy tint to it  it has /none/ ancient brass inlays and it is  locked shut on one side  laura pikes going to take off her scarf  and throw it over it  and try to cover it and wrap it up in  cloth  matt okay  laura and ask grog to put it in the bag  of holding  and wonder if thatll make the magic go  away  travis sure  taliesin im also just going to grab  grog really quickly and  just scrape as much stuff off the shelves  into the bags  because we /none/ need to know what this shit is  matt okay so you grab a number of the tomes  a number of them were destroyed from the  impact of the meteor swarm but the one  you get a number of tomes in there you get  some odds and ends some trinkets some bones  some other things thatre around the territory  and that all seems to go in fine  marisha keyleth goes over to the corpse  of raishan  she takes the staff of melora and shoves  it down into her corpse  /none/ just to see if any reaction happens  matt okay the staff slams into the  flesh  one of the exposed wounds on the  side of raishans body  as it sinks in the staff seems to right itself  in a standing position you let go instinctually  and you watch as the remaining visual of  the black disease  that had begun to spread across the body  spreads rapidly across the entire  body of raishan  what remains of green scale turns to  black and very very quickly  the corpse begins /none/ to wither and blacken  and then turn to this rippled fleshy husk  the staff disengages and falls to the  ground clattering against the stone  seeming that the remainder of the disease  completed its cycle  marisha i just say that was for  scanlan from the ashari bitch  taliesin im going to grog help me pile  all of the dragon remains into a pile the eggs  everything i need a pile were going to try and  remove anything useful especially of the eggs  anything to know what they were but /dung/ i  dont want to take the whole thing  i dont want to leave anything were going  to burn it were going to burn it all  laura i take the gate stone and put it  back  taliesin thank you  patrick knock out these pillars itll  cave this whole thing in  matt okay  taliesin i still want to burn it but  yeah  matt as you kerrek walk toward one of  the edges of the pillars there  there is a flash on the ground a magical  glyph or /none/ a symbol of some kind that triggers  and your body is immediately wracked with  horrible pain  i need you to make a constitution saving  throw  taliesin jesus  laura lets not walk around this place  anymore  patrick 11  matt 11  patrick no no no wait wait wait with  constitution i get  matt ill make sure its constitution  patrick plus seven 15 18 i probably  shouldve been making some of these saving throws  by adding the right numbers to them  liam eh thats dd man  /none/ taliesin its mathlite  matt let me see and make sure it was the  right one yeah okay  so as the excruciating pain takes over  you instinctually start screaming as your  muscles lock up and you are unable to move  you guys all look over suddenly as kerrek  is just locked in place  all the muscles pulled into this tense  moment just screaming in place  travis kerr  marisha what is he grabbing onto is he  grabbing onto something  matt nothing he just walked toward one  of the /none/ pillars  taliesin and hit a glyph  matt in the central area here  taliesin someone shove him off  laura im going to use my rope of  entanglement and grab him  matt okay you pull him off  the glyph still remains glowing in place  and he clatters to the ground  still locked up you dont even see color  or shape right now  its just white from the pain that is  wracking your body  you are unable to move make  conscious thought  you are purely a primal entity /none/ that is  suffering right now  travis can you smash glyphs  liam i walk over im going to try  patrick actually its not much this  is almost better than what i had before  all laugh  liam i kneel down and try lay on hands  on him  because it can cure multiple diseases and  cure poisons with a single use  matt okay so you spend five of your  hit points  liam sure five  matt doesnt seem to assuage him  almost biting through his tongue  allura immediately /none/ looks over and is  going to attempt to dispel  liam is he cursed  matt which succeeds actually she  rolled a 15 plus so  the pain subsides immediately and she  puts her hood back up  as your breath begins to regulate  taliesin lets get out of here  marisha what was that  allura dragon left a symbol  marisha a symbol  allura dont worry about it its gone now  just do not touch that for the next ten minutes  taliesin im going to quickly search  scanlans body for /none/ his wand  travis of fireballs or  taliesin yeah im going to shoot some  fireballs in here when were on our way out  marisha youre going to burn it to the  ground  taliesin im going to burn it to the  fucking ground  marisha i can help you with that  taliesin thank you  matt as can i  marisha as we leave we help burn this  motherfucker to the ground  matt all right as you guys begin to  walk out the three of you  between your staff your /none/ wand and  alluras preparation you guys just  fire explosion sounds  and you watch as elements of the stonework  begin to fall into itself and collapse  not enough to the point where it causes a  full cavein to be endangering to you  but you ensure that this space is no longer used  for whatever purpose it was being used for  you guys continue back out to the edge of  the chasm where the bridge is currently  patrick the bridge got snapped didnt  it  matt it did yeah  /dung/ taliesin but the gravity is off  patrick now the gravitys regular  matt yes  liam we can ferry back and forth on  the carpet  laura yeah ferry on the carpet and  the broom  matt okay you get across without issue  laura pike casts light on her mace so that its  a nicely lit thing its not all creepy and dark  matt all right you guys make your way across  the chasm  you can still hear below and occasionally as  you glance down as the light opens the area /none/ below  you can see the masses of writhing bodies  that are all reaching up from below  but with no magical gravitational trap in effect  they have no effect and are kept at a distance  you make your way across heading back towards  the spiral staircase upwards the glyph  marisha avoiding all that stairstrap  stuff  matt yeah the glyph is still dispelled  from earlier  you guys still make your way up in sections  using your the broom and the magic carpet  as you make your way up into /none/ the next  chamber you begin to hear cackling laughter  marisha are these the fucking ghostrider  skulls again  matt you hear cackling from ahead and you  see a little bit of a light source begin to appear  from the iron door room that you guys had  your first encounter with  marisha are they all just like right  down  matt theyre not quite in sight yet  you can just see the glow as theyre  descending down a grade  marisha and were kind of in a  hallway right  /none/ matt yeah  laura are they technically undead  liam yes  laura then pikes going to use her  yeah shes going to use turn undead on  those motherfuckers  marisha yes  matt okay looking at the radius of turn  undead  ill just doublecheck here because its  pretty close  liam destroy undead  patrick if shes got it  matt it would be destroy undead at fifth  level which she has but yeah  its 30 feet near you so she can wait  laura but they can shoot fireballs so  /none/ maybe thats not smart  taliesin ill actually say the second that  we see them im just going to empty the wand  patrick its fire though  laura yeah  taliesin oh will they just be fine  marisha yeah theyre immune to fire  we need radiant damage  laura im going to just shoot them with arrows  and try to get them from far away i guess  matt all right so you guys are holding your  action for when they come into range essentially  marisha can i see them yet  patrick /none/ is this like a straight tunnel a  straight featureless tunnel heading towards us  matt its a slow grade downward  you guys are heading back up the pathway  and you see them now coming in your direction  taliesin can i just unload on them i  suppose  matt once they come into range  travis is it all four of them  matt youre not sure  patrick we just cant clump like we  were before  marisha ive got a sunbeam ready  to go  taliesin oh well  laura well yours /none/ has a probably  good range on it  marisha 60 foot but i want to get  them in a line  laura ive got 120 feet on my bow  taliesin ive got disgusting range  matt all right so you guys hearing  the cackling and seeing the glow coming  you hold your actions youre holding  your bow  youre holding a sunbeam youre  holding your attacks  marisha im going to line them up  matt that would give you guys immediate  action as soon as they arrive so  sure enough /none/ within a moment you watch  as four of them come into view  the same four that you destroyed earlier  clustered around  theres two lines of two essentially so  travis do they regenerate  laura so im going to do  travis they just grow back like we  shattered two of em  marisha i have a feeling theres a  bunch of these guys  travis fuck  matt so keyleth sunbeam can only affect two  of them so they get their saving throw right  roll 8d6 if you could they laughs /none/  they do not make their saving throws  marisha thats right five six need  two more  taliesin what do you need  marisha d6s  taliesin thats a lot of whiskey  marisha counting 27 radiant damage  matt 27 radiant damage to both of them  all righty got you all right percival  taliesin im going to try doing a  sharpshooter piercing shot  on another round of them with the  pepperbox sharpshooter piercing shot  laura pikes going to do sacred flame  on them too  matt okay  taliesin thats /none/ not bad so thats  the first shot is  marisha its good  taliesin 16  matt hits  taliesin oh then they all hit thats good  so thats 1d10 plus 1d6 so 1d10 plus 1d6  and this is piercing shot so its the enemy line  so wow thats nice thats i have no brain  27 points of damage with five points of  psychic damage for the first shot  matt okay so 19 total  they appear the blasts of the bullets  dont seem to be  doing as much damage as /none/ other forms  of attack  taliesin okay but its hitting both of  them in a row  matt right yeah  taliesin next shot is ha is 28 points  of damage with four points of psychic  matt okay this is the ones she damaged  with the sunbeam  taliesin mmhm  matt both of those skulls just  explosion sound  as soon as the beam streaks past blasting  into two of them two piercing shots in a row  you can watch as their eyes begin to glow  flames glowing within the /none/ back of the skull  two of them immediately just scatter into  dust and bone the two on the other side  taliesin i still have one last shot so  lets do slightly less that time  20 points of damage with one point  of psychic  matt okay  taliesin and thats my contribution  to the world  matt all right  laura pike does sacred flame  matt what level  laura shes a 17th level cleric now  matt right but what spell level  laura its a cantrip  matt oh thats /none/ right  laura so its just 4d8 damage  matt okay yeah  taliesin 4d8 radiant  laura mmhm 4d8 radiant damage  oh yeah thats good 22 radiant damage  they have to do a dexterity saving throw  matt nope  laura cool so one of them takes 22 damage  matt nice  laura im going to do the one that  percy just hit  matt all righty  taliesin i hit both of them  laura oh well theres four of them  taliesin two are down the other two  are damaged  laura /none/ cool well she chooses one and then  im going to as vex shoot arrows at them  matt go for it  laura that doesnt hit because the world  hates me tonight and that one hits  matt all right  laura 17 damage  matt all righty 17 to the one thats  over there  allura who is frustrated and  understanding what their resistances are  shes going to go ahead and cast a  highlevel magic missile  taliesin classic  matt okay that one just explodes  and scatters  so now there /none/ is one left that is just  partially damaged from percival  patrick are they within 30 feet  matt not quite yet  patrick then i leave the ring of  invisibility off and i just charge  matt you just charge in  patrick im heading toward them because  if they hit me and im far enough away  it wont hit the whole group  matt okay as you go rushing in that  triggers them  or the one thats remaining to go ahead  and its going to fire two fire rays at you /none/  marisha fire rays  matt that is 20 to hit  patrick yes it will  matt and 24 to hit  patrick that one wont strangely  enough no it did  all laugh  matt that would be strange  marisha i want that class  matt that is 13 points of fire damage  on one  patrick okay  matt and seven points of fire damage on the other  patrick i will take that  matt all right you watch as both eyes streak  out these burning rays of flame in his direction /none/  both blast him in the shoulder one hits  him in the side of the knee and thigh  but kerrek keeps running forward you can  go ahead and make your attacks if you want  patrick 19  matt hits  patrick and actually thats way better  than 19 im counting dumb this is 18  matt 18 hits  patrick okay so for the first one im  going to burn one for divine smite  matt all righty  patrick and these are undead  matt yes they are  patrick eight eh 11 /dung/ 17 25  matt 25 for both hits thats the first  one  patrick the first hit  matt all right so do the second hit now  patrick and that doesnt do it just to  make sure i didnt kill it with the first one  matt it doesnt destroy it no  patrick okay then the second one  matt it does crack the skull and you  watch as the sutures cave in from below  the light of your hammer still  laura these are hardy skulls  patrick right and 12 22 23 /none/ 31  all radiant  matt 31 thatll do it with that the  first blow knocks it almost to the ground  as it begins to lift up again its mouth  cackling you hit it with the side of the hammer  and it just scatters into broken bone  chunks and shards  that splatter against the wall and rattle  down the grade a bit  towards your direction as kerrek turns around  looking back over his shoulder at you guys  the pathway now clear ahead of you  patrick its matteroffact there was /none/  no serpentine it was like  and then it was just cutting wood  matt yeah you guys continue forward  you make your way to the chamber  with the iron door still open  eventually walking to the outskirts of  the entranceway to the sanctum  you now walk carefully around the  previously noticed patches of dirt and sand  laura oh i grab those immovable  rods when we get out of there  matt right and as you pull them out  it seals the tunnel once more behind you  liam lets /none/ find a tree  travis yeah how do we go  marisha allura do you have any more  teleportations left  matt no that was the one  marisha lets find a big ol tree then  ill burn my seventhlevel spell  liam do we see any trees everything was  dead the closer we got to the central  marisha we have to get to a living tree  that we can all fit through  matt actually she goes  i do have a teleportation circle so i  may be able to bring us to /none/ emon  marisha do we want to go to emon or  anywhere else  laura we can go to greyskull keep  travis why whats there  marisha can you get us to greyskull  keep or at least the  travis we need something thatll get scanlan whats the quickest  laura sarenraes temple  travis is at greyskull keep or  laura i mean thats where our chapel  is in our house  marisha pike and i have a little temple  yeah  travis oh right  matt thats one of the few teleportation sigils /none/  that still exist in that vicinity at least  travis yeah do it do it yeah  marisha if it doesnt work at sarenraes temple  i can use a treestride to get us elsewhere  lets get to greyskull keep  matt all right  she gets down and begins marking out the  symbol on the ground on the outskirts  she finishes you watch the arcane flash  travis no no no  matt she steps onto the circle and  vanishes the teleportation circle  and kimas about to go behind her and kima goes /none/  i dont it doesnt usually look like that  marisha what allura didnt vanish  did she  matt allura stepped onto it after  casting it and then vanished  there was a weird sparkle of electrical energy  travis what do you mean it doesnt look  like that normally  matt i dont know i dont know  marisha do we follow or do something  else  laura i dont understand no kima  marisha kima  matt and kima just walks in after her  sparks once more  laura does anybody know what /none/ the fuck  travis what did that mean  laura what was that supposed to look  like what it was supposed to look like  marisha can we do some sort of check  patrick i dont know arcane  marisha i dont either  laura tearfully scanlan does  marisha tearfully scanlan does  he would know  matt you can make an arcana check  taliesin id love to make an arcana  check  marisha for scanlan  patrick ill roll the bones in case  its a religious thing  laura i mean as perception /none/ thing if  weve seen a teleportation circle before  would we at least know that it doesnt  look like its supposed to  marisha yells nothing i dont know  shit  taliesin 22  matt 22  taliesin yep  matt as you get closer and look at it  youve seen a few teleportation circles  and once theyre down they just kind of glow  with this mild energy until they dissipate  which is pretty rapid lets see here  travis we need those two right to do  what we need to do /none/ we have to go with them  taliesin we dont  laura we dont  marisha i can get us there via tree if  we need to theres a tree in sarenraes  travis youd better be right if we  leave those two behind  matt yeah it only lasts for a round  so its  taliesin six seconds  matt yeah six seconds  laura so we have to make this  decision stat  matt now  laura but what if it took them  somewhere  matt you glancing at it there is a /none/  flicker to it and weird crackling  very similar to the weird flash that  you saw when you were inside  and attempted the original teleportation  theres something  you get the sense that theres something  about this  either this mountain or this underground  area  theres something that has some sort of influence  or impact on any sort of transportation magic  marisha who knows where they just got  teleported to  patrick or if they ended up anywhere at  all  travis do we need them  liam i /dung/ mean the amount of talking were  doing its already closed at this point  matt its gone  laura oh my god  marisha fuck  travis go find a tree we all start  running  marisha no no no  taliesin no  marisha yeah we find a tree we find  a tree  taliesin we go to the beach and we find  a tree we get as far away from this cave  patrick as far away  liam yes  laura what if where did they just go what  if we just /none/ sent them to some plane of existence  marisha i dont know i can try to scry  on them  i can try and scry on them and see but  thats going to take time  travis yeah yeah now  taliesin one crisis at a time  liam we just start walking grog and i  start walking  taliesin we start walking to the beach  marisha can i scry while were walking  matt the ritual requires you  taliesin the ball  laura what about the ball  marisha can i get a piggyback /none/ from grog  and scry while were walking  taliesin on the carpet  laura yeah on the carpet  matt you could probably try that  id give you a concentration check to  maintain it for the duration  marisha lets do it lets do it  taliesin im going to take a rest on  the carpet  and im going to fly the carpet while you  do your thing  travis vax and i are still walking  marisha im going to cast i havent burned  any fifthlevel spells im going to scry  /none/ matt okay  laura pikes going to cast healing on  people  matt okay  taliesin she might want to save well  well see seems like we know where  matt okay  patrick whoevers low i know some  people are pretty low  marisha im really low  laura everybodys low super low  matt you guys slowly make your way  through the forest  avoiding the patches that you noticed  before the weird collapsing earth  marisha im just laying back on the  carpet in a truststate as they guide me  /none/ matt go ahead and make a constitution  saving throw keyleth  marisha just straight constitution  matt yeah  marisha 15  matt 15 okay  marisha no no no 17 plus five  matt what are you focusing on  marisha allura  matt allura okay  marisha oh no oh no  matt okay so you focus on alluras life  force form face and as you close your eyes  slowly moving along with the gradual  movement of the flying carpet  your vision pulls out of you and above  an island  it /none/ then shifts suddenly and pulls you  over blue  over water and then theres another flash  and theres nothing but water around you  you dont know where you are you dont know where it is and it flashes once more  and there in the center of this open expanse  of water and ocean you see two figures swimming  and you glance down and there in the  middle of the ocean waters  you see allura treading water shouting  kimas name kima  and looking across the way you can just barely  /none/ hear in the distance allie im coming  she swims over in that direction  they eventually grab each others hands  and together hold each other and look around  keeping treading water as the sun is  slowly beginning to set in the distance  and nightfall comes  you just see allura holding her there  trying to keep both aloft  its all right were alive i dont  know where we are  but well figure this out well figure  this out  and they both begin swimming looking  at the direction of /none/ the sun  and picking what looks to be a northern  position and then the scry  marisha do i see any land is there  an island  matt you cannot see the scrying is  specifically on her  but they are both just plopped somewhere  in the ocean  laura if we wouldve gone through  taliesin we wouldve been in trouble  liam drowning  laura well no we have the fucking magic  carpet  taliesin that cant hold all of us  laura oh my god  marisha i tell them what /none/ happened when  i wake up i dont even know where they could be  theyre in the middle of the ocean  they could be right off the coast or  hundreds of miles from here  this ocean  taliesin this is fine  were going to go to whitestone now  were not going to go to greyskull  and were going to get gilmores help  liam gilmore yes  marisha but theyre our friends are we  just going to leave them behind  taliesin were going to get gilmores  help  travis one /none/ thing at a time  liam thats right thats right  marisha i mean keyleth starts  hyperventilating panicking a little bit  laura keyleth we need you right now  marisha theyre okay right allura will  figure it out right  laura shell figure it out shes so  powerful  liam yeah  marisha okay  liam one thing at a time  marisha this is taking everything to not  stay here okay  travis still moving towards the beach  looking for live trees  matt a short time later you eventually  get close /none/ to the edge of the waterline  and you do find a handful of trees  that appear to be  alive enough and large enough to maintain  one of your spells  marisha i do a useless scan of the ocean  out of desperation to see if i see anything  matt perception check  taliesin ill join  laura yeah yeah yeah  marisha natural 20  laura gasps  marisha its true it was a gil dice it  was gils dice you can see you can see  matt and add your perception bonus /none/  marisha 31  matt 31  marisha perceptions 11  matt you take a moment and you dont  know if its the sense of the scry spell  and something about the arcane winds that  blow through the ley lines of magic  that traverse across exandria but  something guides your attention that way  and you focus real hard  and you see just at the horizon what looks  to be a very very faint speck of movement  travis shut the fuck up  marisha there they are oh shit  laura i /none/ take off on the broom  marisha i dont know if thats them  i think thats them  taliesin no wait  patrick kerrek puts his hand on her  shoulder and says oh child  laura i take off on the broom im out  in the direction that she went  patrick wishing doesnt make it so  marisha no i know i know but look  look theres something  it could be something else but its  something  taliesin keyleth  laura yeah im going im going i went  matt you arcing as /none/ fast as you can on  the broom  full speed holding on to the hat as best  you can  the wind of the ocean air coming past  your face  the salt and the briny spray of bits of  reef and rock that surround the island  marisha im trying to give vex over the  earpiece like a  warmer warmer warmer colder a  little ten degrees to your left  matt yeah you do look out and you see both kima  and allura swimming through the ocean exhausted  and it /none/ looks like based on both the heavy armor  that kimas wearing and their general  physical state  theyre both having a hard time treading water  and theyre swimming in the wrong direction  laura i fly over them and just tell  them hang onto the broom  matt oh thats the best thing i  couldve hoped for seeing  and allura reaches up and grabs your arm  and says kima hold on and grabs the edge  you can see kima now is like coughing up water  and is trying desperately to tread /none/ water  thats a natural 20 on a strength check  for allura holy shit with no modifier  manages to hold onto both you and  kima and keep you up  i need you to make an athletics check  just to hold on  laura 13  matt 13 okay its enough to maintain  carrying them both back as fast as the  broom which is not very fast at this time  it takes you probably a good 15 or  so minutes  and as the tensions going on you can see  allura /none/ getting more and more exhausted  laura keep holding were almost there  darling  matt im trying  marisha i just keep saying vex  did you find them  taliesin im taking the carpet that  direction  marisha vex  patrick if its been this long kerrek  has given the talk like  marisha im just crying in kerreks  shoulder right now just bawling my eyes out  taliesin ill be back in a moment im taking  the carpet towards the speck i see on the  and probably ten minutes in is where /dung/ i  would have given it ten minutes  im on the way with the carpet  laura i have them  marisha i swear i saw them i swear  matt at this point you can see alluras  grip is getting shaky on the broom now  she says were almost close enough  now and then her and kima vanish  in a puff of dark bluish energy and appear on  the carpet next to you through dimension door  taliesin yelps im so tired  marisha still sobbing into kerreks  shoulder  patrick its /none/ been a slow litany of sometimes  people go and you never get them back  its hes giving you the wrong pep talk  marisha oh god so wait maybe they were  just dead and i saw their ghosts  laura we have them we have them  marisha what and i just cry harder  liam vax is also listening to that sometimes  you cannot get them back while holding scanlan  laura wailing like little dobby in  harry potter  matt eventually you guys manage to gather  the rest of your party at /none/ the beachside  waterlogged kima shakes it out leaving this  trail as her hairs all matted and into her face  and she just looks really pissed and is  like not a word  alluras squeezing out the sides of her  braids well now what  laura whitestone  marisha lets take a tree shall we  matt lets try i think this definitely  explains why so many folks  who went to investigate this place  never came back  patrick are we as far away as we can be  like we came in /none/ on a tree right  travis were on the beach  matt you came in on a tree yes  patrick okay  taliesin that doesnt mean a lot but  yeah were as far as we can get  matt so you go ahead and find the tree  all right hm  as you reach out and touch the side of the tree  eyes clenched tight hoping that  this is enough  you watch as the bark splits into  the transportation via plants portal  and as it splits apart  you can see further /none/ internal wood  striations those split  a third layer splits its having to force its way through this tree  and finally it divides out and you can see the  sunsetlit outside of the center of whitestone  taliesin oh thank god  marisha i hold the door open like its a closing  elevator am i sure its fucking whitestone  matt it appears to be whitestone  laura weve got six seconds go  marisha go  taliesin im running for it  matt you guys all charge through  making your way through the portal /none/  marisha and i go in last  matt you all step out catching yourself  just as the tree slams behind you  there you see the faintly blossoming  branches of the sun tree  greeting you to the center of sunsetting  whitestone together as a group  clutching scanlans lifeless body in your  arms still vax what do you do  marisha i cry to kerr a little bit more  travis no no time for that  taliesin no time  laura get him to the castle  marisha okay sorry  laura right /none/  marisha no should we get him to the  castle or the raven queens temple  liam to the temple of the raven queen  marisha okay to the temple to the temple  taliesin scry find his daughter  scry on his daughter  marisha okay i use my oh jeez i cant remember  no i didnt use any of my scrying eye on raishan at all right  taliesin no  marisha that was my spell just now i will use  my scrying eye now to see if i can find kaylie  liam im /none/ already 50 feet towards the  temple  matt okay you guys all make your way  towards the temple of the raven queen  and the graveyard outside of whitestone as  youre making this scry attempt with the item  go ahead and make another concentration check as  youre moving along and doing this on the carpet  marisha thats cocked thats not bad  just a regular what do i use  matt its a constitution saving throw  marisha con saving throw then 16  matt remember you have warcaster so you  technically have /none/ advantage on concentration too  marisha oh my god oh my god  matt dont forget that  marisha no 16  matt okay little bit of a show okay  your vision pulls back  and is dragged fast enough through the  clouds to have no sense of direction  suddenly you feel your essence thrust  downward through the clouds once more  towards the closing daylight around kymal  in the center of taldorei  marisha shes in kymal  matt looking down to the rather dirty  destitute  gamblingoverrun and lightlawenforced  city that /tavern/ kymal is  youre pulled once more into what looks  to be a tavern room  and there you see a makeshift band of  very terrible performers playing  and at the back table you see kaylie with  half a flagon of ale sitting there  dagger on the table just staring and just  giving those performers shit shes like  you all fucking suck you know that  marisha oh i love her so much right now  matt where i come from theyd kill you  for this thats terrible certainly  marisha knowing /none/ how scrying works and knowing  that certain magiccasters can feel it  this is going on a limb i just yell through  the scrying and audibly amongst everyone  kaylie its scanlan  trying to push through the magical boundary and  see if i can at least get a reaction out of her  matt okay youre shouting this you  guys hear her doing this  and you just keep pushing forward  occasionally checking to make sure shes okay  kaylie just keeps drinking from the  flagon and is shouting out  someone comes /none/ by and you watch as she deftly  nabs a little bit of coin from the pocket  marisha and i scream again kaylie  matt doesnt seem to be having an effect  taliesin kymal  marisha god damn it i wish you could  talk to people through scrying sometimes  laura who can send me there  marisha shes in kymal  laura who can send me there ill go  marisha allura might be able to send  her a message  allura do you still have any messages  left  matt i can cast /none/ sending yes  marisha has she ever met kaylie  laura i dont think so  liam no  laura we need to get her and bring  her here  liam can we get the other gate stone  and find shaun  laura ive got the gate stone yes  liam we have both of them we have them  taliesin no we have the one gate stone  liam yeah doesnt your sister have  the other one  taliesin she has the other one  liam yes find the other gate stone and  find shaun /none/  laura find the other gate stone i take  off to find gilmore  matt okay  taliesin i will go get the other gate stone  marisha im tapped out of teleportations  taliesin its fine we can make this  work  and in the meantime take him to the  raven queen temple  matt and so is allura  marisha tapped out of teleportation  matt yeah  patrick now from what i know about the raven queen  she is not like oh you can get a  doover right  laura no  /none/ patrick she is like you are dead and that is  the line you do not cross to not come back  liam its a little more complicated  laura well he is her champion  patrick yeah but from what i know  matt from what you know as kerrek  yeah shes  patrick shes the one that fucking holds  this line like you do not come back  matt she guides you one way or the  other  shes the mistress of fate and if your  destiny is cut short there is exception  /none/ patrick okay okay  matt however her real loathing is for those  people who go against that natural destiny  patrick that abrogate the natural order  matt exactly  patrick okay right  matt unnatural unexpected death across ones  fate line is unfortunate but it can be corrected  patrick okay okay  matt so you go ahead and you look for  gilmore  you find gilmore with a big mug of coffee  in his comfort robes  still recovering from the war the  previous day  his hairs tousled up and hes sitting /tavern/  there cradling it  looking out as the suns setting in the  main common mess area of the castle  and as you walk in  oh vexahlia you return  laura i just run straight up darling  matt yes yes  laura do you have teleportation do you have  anything that can send me to kymal kymal  liam kymal  laura to kymal  marisha in a tavern in kymal  matt i nervous

city  nearby anything  matt i mean theres westruun but that  sigil got destroyed too whats wrong  laura tearfully i dont know what to do  scanlans down we have to find his daughter  matt puts his mug down and stands up slowly  his demeanor gets very stoic and very dark  well lets see what we can do follow  me  and he begins walking down and leads you  /none/ towards the home that hes been staying  here in whitestone  he goes in and its barely furnished  based on the original attack on whitestone  when you guys had the assassins that  came after you here  its been cleaned up but it hasnt been  replaced  he goes rummaging through some things up in  his room he goes through a few bags and goes  i dont really have many options  is it a  laura i just need to get there  matt have you talked to allura  laura shes /none/ out out of spells  matt hold on and he leads you back up  to the castle what are you guys doing  liam all this time i have laid scanlan  down in the center of the temple  and with a wet rag i have cleaned his face and  combed his hair out and laid mythcarver  out next to him  laura probably gave him some clean pants  because hes covered in piss  marisha yeah  matt yeah youve got to scrub that  down a little  travis im waiting outside the /none/ temple  because i probably cant go in  right i cant go in there  laura why  travis i dont know im just me  liam while im cleaning i start talking  as well  you know if it is his time then i can  accept that it is his time  but he just did an awful lot for you  that dragon was tampering with your ways  and without him we would have not  gotten as far as we have  he has done a lot for you and this isnt  /none/ even bargaining anymore  i am yours im not bargaining  but this little man has more heart in his  chest than any man ive met  and if there is anyone who deserves  a second chance  i dont know i dont know your will be  done  marisha i grab grog on the outside of  the temple also standing outside  and i just grab him by his massive  gigantic shoulder and say  you were closer to him than probably  anyone else in this group  you knew more of his /none/ secrets than  anyone else  i think it would mean something if you  talked to him from beyond  travis how do i do that  marisha his spirit still holds on you can still  speak to his spirit and convince it to come back  convince it to come back grog you knew him  you knew him look inside and you will know  travis what i just start talking to him  marisha and i crack the door to the  temple open and try and gesture him in  travis oh in there /none/ im not really  religious though like i dont  marisha you dont have to be religious you had  the connection with scanlan and you have heart  that connection speaks far stronger than  any religion ever could its up to you  we dont know if kaylie will make it  travis right okay for scanlan then  and i go into the temple of the raven queen  matt okay are you guys having pike prepare  the resurrection ritual is that whats going on  laura i guess so  matt i dont know whats /none/ happening  you guys are talking to air right now  marisha well i was talking to grog  matt right right right  taliesin trying to put together the  resurrection ritual  matt okay thats what i thought  laura trying to prepare that yeah  liam i wasnt expecting that wasnt  part of the ritual  matt right right  patrick so everybody here is a mess right  and when they brought them out of the ocean  kerrek was like because that shook him  you know because he knew at this point  /none/ now is the point where all your friends die but  these guys i cant talk to they are all messed  how bad are you  taliesin outwardly im fine  patrick okay  taliesin im in getshitdone mode  patrick right i get you a little aside  taliesin im probably coming back down  now from the castle with the stone  patrick what can his sister do  something or his daughter  taliesin his daughter  patrick why why the urgency i mean  taliesin because its the only thing i  can think of /none/  that could really drag him back from wherever he is  thats my thought ive been there  ive experienced this  patrick been where  taliesin ive died and you need to  its not easy  and you need to not everything cuts  through  you need to find the right thing to cut  through and i think this might be it  so its where im putting my bets  matt

a day and begins doing this  incantation  as he traces his fingers through the air  you watch these lines begin to connect  and hes tracing almost this mystical  map of the portions of taldorei  and as each finger hits a point you see  him connect a thread  as he connects a thread both of you  blink out  and appear in the middle of this busy  cobblestone street  you can /dung/ hear what sounds like raucous  laughter and shouting in the distance  from two different directions  you can see now as the night has gone  from a bright orange and purple  to the dark reds and blues of postsunset  there are a couple of what look to be  guards wandering the street  but they themselves look to be laughing and  probably a little tipsy in their own right  you see many humans and you see a  couple of halforcs  you actually see two gnolls and what  looks to /town/ be a goblin  that are wandering amongst those  people in the street  kymal is and youve passed through  before kymal is its the real  its the seedy reno of taldorei  if you will  marisha i mean renos already  pretty seedy so  matt its not laughlin level its not  sorry laughlin  marisha sorry reno  matt go ahead and make an  investigation check  laura im just terrified of all my dice  liam high rolls  laura 16  matt 16 okay  laura wait but i didnt /town/ add anything to  that investigation thats a 23  matt okay yeah asking questions rapidly  around dragging eskil behind hes like  where are we going grumbling  asking to where the worst performers  youve seen perform in this town  and everyone keeps pointing you to this  one place thats up on this one hill  towards the back of the ironseat ridge which  is the mountain that kymal is up against  as you walk into the tavern you see a little  more than a dozen people in various clusters  some /tavern/ of them are ready to go  theyve been drinking since sundown  and theyre already pretty sauced  theres a terrible offkey band in the corner  of four people three gentlemen and a lady  taliesin terrible band name  matt its a terrible band name and its  pretty bad  and there you see halfslumped over in  the corner at the table you see kaylie  just ready to
