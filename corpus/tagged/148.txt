matt whats great is the longer you keep it next to ronin he doesnt actually have to feed  travis oh jesus  /none/ laughter  liam deep voice hey how you doing  matt i believe thats the extent of our announcements and as such that brings us in to  tonights episode of critical role  tv static click  groovy critical role theme  laughter  matt points to travis on that one its the ellipses at the end like a little squeak last we  left off the mighty nein in pursuing a thread of a mysterious orb that seemed to connect in some  way to the entity in which fjord has somehow connect himself to and as such /none/ been granted these  strange eldritch powers led you southward from the menagerie coast after commandeering a ship  called the mist turned into the mistake followed it through some dangerous reefs to a pirate ship  called the squalleater and there on the captain avantika you made a pact with her where the  choice was to either die or to help aid her and a companion she hired for this to help navigate this  island this strange seemingly dangerous or cursed island to which you made your way through  the jungle of this urukaxl managed to /none/ avoid lizardmen managed to barely sneak through a  ancient city of yuanti making your way to the top of this temple and through the interior a  series of battles later an encounter with a strange lightless internal orchard in which two of  the fruit within had been eaten by two members of your team and have been tripping balls ever since  sam thats right oh god  matt you made your way to the bottom subterranean guardian chamber where you met a  yuanti abomination that was laying guard to the true guardian a large hydra /none/ the hydra had turned  around and laid waste to much of your party but you managed to through a series of clever  choices uses of fire magic and some rapid assaults managed to cleave all the heads from its  body and kill it just in time its corpse now lying fresh on the ground captain avantika  seeming pleased and impressed by the display of the strange new compatriots that have now come to  work under her you now sit in the stillness of this chamber able to now finally take a moment to  look /none/ about and see what secrets or mysteries it holds so mighty nein what would you like to do  sam was any of that real  travis oh no youre still  liam we just need to wait this out we killed all the creatures how many eyes do i have right now  because it feels like i have three of them  sam you do you have three eyes  liam thats good  marisha whats avantika doing  matt avantika is sitting down for a second and getting her breath the rest of you who are still /none/  up in the hallway which is jester caduceus and jamedi and caleb all begin to slowly descend the stairs  liam whoa  travis yeah its been a fucking thing in here whats so funny hey zip it the hydra did it  sliding back in the hole or is it still out  matt no its currently slung over the side of the staircase that curves down into the  subterranean chamber  marisha how do they make you sound differently it feels like you sound different because of the  gloves i think its just in my /none/ head  travis its just in your head i got stung by some wasps out by the barn  laughter  travis ah yall have benadryl  matt two healing potions and an epipen hold on  travis that was a thing caduceus  taliesin yeah  travis is jamedi up there  taliesin in theory  matt jamedis currently standing at the top glancing around the side  taliesin i assure you its safe now  liam oh yeah hey you guy how come you did not do anything  matt he glances around and steps down another step /none/ i was not paid to do anything of this sort  i was a guide i was to delve i am not skilled in the ways you are im not stupid to throw myself  in front of a beast so large  sam worried you could maybe die  liam it was pretty touchandgo do you want to sit back and stay safe and then get eaten i am  really not myself right now  marisha yeah youre being super aggro its intense  taliesin is jamedi wearing any weapons  matt actually make a perception check  /none/ taliesin actually im going to use this new d20 and see how that goes  sam oh whered you get this  taliesin the con ah thats good thats a good start 27  matt looking at his person he has a short bow and a dagger and that is it hes not armed for  any sort of main assault in fact most of his equipment and materials in the way hes armored  and dressed is for expediency lack of sound and meant to blend into his surroundings fairly easy  a lot of browns grays and dull /none/ greens hes definitely more of a scout and a tracker based on  his skill set from what youve seen than any sort of frontline fighter  marisha i want to go over to avantika  matt as you approach she gets up and rummages off the side and pulls off a small lantern she  keeps notched on the side of her belt  marisha do i see anything else tucked up under there while she is doing that that looks of  interest or of importance  matt make a perception check  marisha okay okay 19  /none/ matt nothing in particular beyond what she previously had that you can tell at the moment  no its a small lantern maybe that big and she pulls a piece of cloth out that was meant to keep  it from clattering or making any noise on the inside she pulls out the cloth tucks it in her  pocket ignites the end of an oil wick the lantern glows a bit and gives off some light she  begins walking along the walls of the inside of the chamber  taliesin im going to cast detect magic  marisha /none/ on the lantern  taliesin on everything including our friends and everything in the room  travis ill mirror avantikas movement on the other side of the room  matt as you cast detect magic a few things all of your friends give off a faint aura everything  but jamedi gives off a magical aura you also sense the columns themselves have a fairly  powerful deep magical aura to them thats the most you can see at the moment  taliesin nothing jamedi is wearing at all is giving off a  matt nothing fjord as you begin /none/ to walk along what would be considered the southern walls around  this side of the chamber you and avantika looking across the walls appear to be made of the  same eldest stone that this temple is made from the newer materials that have been plastered and  set against what once was this original temple did not make its way this far into the basement it  seems that there is no intent to cover or at least hasnt gotten to the point of covering what  originally lined the walls of this chamber and as such the /none/ original carvings remain what you see  are three massive carved murals on that wall that wall and this far side mirroring the placement  of the three pillars these murals stand probably 15 feet tall and about 20 or so feet wide you can  see them depicting these giant faintly detailed and gently colored scenes though a lot of the  coloration seems to have faded with dust and time some of the stone has been stained or painted to  show some variation in color you can make out the simple shapes to fill out this much /town/ larger  tapestry on the stone before you the one on that far wall as you come across it you see a crowd  of people simple design but definitive heads and shoulders and legs you can see the humanoid form  and there are many many clustered around the base of this mural above them you can see three  larger humanoid figures that are haloed by a light or an aura that elevates them beyond this crowd  three figures then over the top of that taking up probably 60 percent or more of this mural you  /dung/ see a humongous bird of dark purple flame that is wreathing the sky above this crowd you see its  wings curved upward and then bent down and where the wings end fire curls and burns and the  feathers on the edges of these wings definitively come up into a purple and dark gray flame with  bits and specks of deep red at the top where its head looks down the beak long and pointed there  are three eyes across its face and in each of these eyes you see set a rather large onyx stone  /dung/ sam its a bird  matt a large flaming bird  marisha like a phoenix  matt like a phoenix but dark purples and grays and deep reds in color  liam three eyes each one is an onyx stone  matt each one of those eyes is an onyx stone probably about that big  taliesin mr fjord i feel like i should mention im keeping a lookout for anything and im getting  a bit of a magical aura from the three columns i dont know if its related to this  liam are you reading anything off /none/ of all of the eyes that i am seeing those stones  matt you dont see any magical essence on the carving or the stones just from those pillars  glancing at the pillars too theres faint carved designs and shapes like swirling almost  serpentine circles and curves that chain into each other and swirl off imagine a column made of  chains if you will but the patterns are erratic in places and dont seem to follow  taliesin the three columns are very similar theres nothing unique the pattern within them  doesnt deviate too much  /town/ matt from what you can tell no  taliesin all right  matt thats the far wall if you continue curving around to the one closest to me you meet up with  avantika at that point she holds her lantern up and you can see a very similar layout a very  familiar showing of a crowd much like the previous one though some of their shapes have  different shoulders it looks almost like their clothing or whatever their accoutrements are are  different it seems to insinuate a different people above them three more figures stand  /none/ shown larger and emanating some sort of radiance or aura above that you see this giant coiled  serpent of scale fin and eyes made of amber each of these eyes is a separate amber piece about  that big around the size of a large gold piece all along the coil of its body at the very top  where its rearing up this very long thin pointed almost lizardlike maw opens up and  behind it this giant tidal wave is curling and frozen in place looking like its about to bear  down on and either destroy /town/ or sweep away the crowd below it  liam question do the eyes in this picture bear any resemblance to the tattoos i spied through the  window when i eavesdropped through frumpkin on fjord and avantikas conversation  matt very much so  liam very much so okay  sam two eyes on this one  matt on this one the head of it has three eyes as well but the body itself has eyes evenly  spaced around the entire length of its coiled body  liam und amber for the three eyes on the head or every /none/ single time  matt every single eye on it is a piece of amber matching size  travis the eyes theyre there right its part of the mural theyre not missing or recessed or anything  matt they all appear to be present  liam you described the first group looked humanoid no strange features just arms legs  head but for the second one with the serpent theyre a little weird  matt more detail has been put into them more care has been placed into their carving  travis onyx eyes for the first creature  marisha amber /none/ eyes for the second what about the third ill go over and look at the far mural  matt avantika continues curving around with a big wideeyed smile on her face as she passes by  it she goes this is incredible  travis yes its very stimulating have you ever seen imagery like this before  matt i can only assume this is carved by the kinau  travis yeah yep the kinau  marisha the quinoa  travis nope the kinau theyre the followers of ukotoa right  matt that is correct  sam the kinau  travis /town/ kinau  matt she continues curving around beau and caduceus as you walk to the other wall that side  of the chamber there you see a curling thick worm of some kind its folded skin and toothlike  scales burrowing up to produce mountains over the crowd cliff faces made of stone and rock breaking  and about to plummet into the crowd below there beneath it you see three figures once more  elevated the same wreath around them of some sort of radiance or light the people below dont seem  scared theres no sign of fleeing /none/ or fear just a gathering within this large terrifying  wormlike creature its form bulbous with these strange protrusions these spinelike scales that  you can imagine would pull it through the broken earth you see this ring of teeth that accentuates  where its mouth is and on the inside where a tongue would be there instead are three eyes  across the inside of its mouth these appear to be made of some kind of ivory some polished white material  sam wow that is vivid  liam also the three figures on each wall are they standard /none/ humanoid form  matt the three figures all appear to be humanoid theyre not detailed enough to the point where you  can see features to differentiate between elven human halfling  sam do they seem to be the same three on each or is it just silhouettes  matt its just silhouettes of three figures  travis fuck fuck fuck  matt you hear avantikas voice echo from across the way she goes these are the chosen she  brings light over towards the one of ukotoa on the wall and goes i guess that makes this one  /none/ me she takes her finger and takes a little blood from the corner of her mouth from the fight and  draws a little smiley face on one of the three and this one is you and goes and draws another  face on the middle one  travis i can see the resemblance the question is if thats you and thats me whos our third friend  matt that is a very good question  travis you said you had met only one other chosen before  matt only one yes  travis and what happened to them  /none/ matt they were a very informative partner they are the one that introduced me to the great  possibility of power under ukotoa we traveled this ocean for quite a number of years together  but they proved to be a coward they took something important to our mission and vanished  and i have spent many years trying to recover what they stole with no luck i figured it was more  worth my time to pillage enough coin to pay other people to find them for me and so far based on  the fact that it brought /none/ you to me a much more successful endeavor eh  travis indeed this person that seemed to have shown you the light did you try to track them  down do you know anything about them or where they might be they would seem to be very useful  in our current situation  matt this is very true well it seems i may have some information lets get back to the ship  eh lets finish our business here and lets talk over a glass of wine  travis well were obviously not in a huge rush we have /none/ not explored all of this  matt this is true she begins to make her way towards the well at the center of the chamber  taliesin i was heading that way myself  liam is there any writing of any kind  matt glancing about at the pillars you two can see within the shapes glowing runes that trace  from ceiling to floor then across the ground and all meet at the well  liam am i able to read it with the comprehend languages that should still be cooking because  its an hourlong spell  matt /none/ its not technically a language these are runes these are glyphs of some kind make an  arcana check  liam come on dice be good to me no that is a 17  matt there are different epochs in historical time in which there have been advances and  developments of arcane runes and sigils there is the early basis of magical runes which is a  deviation of draconic as a language and then there are ways that theyve been altered and made  more efficient these are very old base early draconic runes as such they hold /none/ a lot more very  primal magical power and usually are reserved for larger rituals and magics that are meant to last  for very long periods of time the nature of the magic on these runes from what you can tell its  a little hard to get the direct essence but there is some sort of an abjurationbased magic  sam im going to go investigate not the hydra the creature that i killed  matt you head on over to the other yuanti and as you approach the body lies there tongue  lolling out and drool /dung/ and blood a mixture of thick saliva mingling with the dark blackpurple  blood out of the corner of its mouth its eyes wide open and rolled back its dark thick green  scales of its snakelike head and thick muscular scaled torso all lie limp across the stone where  it was slain its blade has clattered to the ground a few feet from its grasp and its polished  marble and silver shield scattered a few feet from its form the rest of its tail coils and is limp  off to the side from there  sam /none/ ill rifle around looking for any keys or objects  matt make an investigation check  sam 25  matt nice you find on its body 26 pieces of gold only gold no other pieces of coin on its  body the blade is a very very large blade it looks like its well made both for ceremonial  purposes and for actual combat it is both beautiful and very well made and the shield  itself is also exquisitely crafted and shows no signs of wear  sam ill take the shield and hang on to it until i /none/ can give it someone who wants it  matt okay at this point avantikas walked to the edge of the well and looks down into the space below  marisha i walk up behind her and i go huh  matt do you really  marisha yeah  sam like pushing her  marisha yeah i dont actually push her in but i just want to freak her out  travis shes going to do that  matt she whips around as you do that and both her hand grabs your wrist to deflect it and you wrench  your /none/ wrist free as a natural instinct and you both have this moment of  matt and marisha eh  travis you know i do have a solution i think for this jamedi you worthless sack of shit you  havent done a damn thing since we got in this temple you like to scout ahead go forward get  your ass down that well  matt hes still at the top of the stairs he goes well for one thing i was paid to go to  the temple and no further the fact that i have even come this /none/ far is because i need to claim my pay  travis what do you want a cookie get down the fucking well lets go  matt avantika goes actually i think ladies first  travis well i would insist to join you if that is the case  matt may the best one win she dives in  travis shit balls  liam wait fjord can i talk to you for a second before you go down there  travis real quick  liam there is the pillars are covered when i do the shield when i cover myself and /none/ put the  shield the columns have that in them  travis the pillars are magic  liam yeah but its protection its holding something in or holding something back we know  what that thing is with the yellow eyes but what is the tapeworm  travis i dont know i dont want her to get too far ahead  sam i have a few things that id like to talk about  travis okay go  matt okay you jump in first off calebs distraction has given her quite a lead shes a  fairly accomplished swimmer and /none/ is making her way down this well continues on for a good 70 80 or  so feet below the water is cold it is salt water  travis oh  marisha salt water  travis salt water not brackish but salt water  matt right you are swimming after her  travis mhm  matt make an athletics check you have advantage because the water is because of your armor its  not giving you as much resistance heading south  travis athletics 19  matt you begin to close the gap slowly but shes eagerly swimming down with /dung/ almost a fervor as you  get deeper into this column this basin below the walls begin to grow thick with algae and grime  like a thick it could be a plant matter thats just accrued over the walls or it could be waste  matter from the hydra in its home that has slowly congealed to cover the walls the stone begins to  give way to this dark slick material once you hit about the 70 80 foot point the tunnel begins  to open like a giant bulb or internal spherical chamber role another athletics check /dung/  travis 14  matt shes still keeping her distance from you heading deeper in the saltiness of the water the  brininess the flavor in your mouth gets more intense what was once a semblance of sea water is  definitively sea water but also very strongly briny sea water make another athletics check  travis the bulb weve entered that chamber right  matt correct  travis whats our visibility like 40 60  matt for you because you have dark vision you can see within 30 feet of you essentially as far  as you look the /none/ chamber is  travis theres not a lot of natural light right  matt no not at all its pitch black down here that being the case you dont see the bottom of  the chamber you just see it open  travis and just her  matt and just her but shes gaining  travis james cameron going down to find the titanic  matt just delving straight down into the darkness make another athletics check  travis 20  matt 20 okay she did not role that well that time shes beginning to tire it seems or at /dung/  least youre starting to pick up speed as you continue to follow you get probably 40 or so feet  from her but shes still ahead of you role again  travis natural 20  matt natural 20 nice she rolled okay you see now the bottom begin to approach in the  peripheral of your dark vision the floor greets to meet you and you pick up enough speed to where  you both impact the bottom of this chamber at the same time you both hit she looks up at you and  your eyes meet a /none/ few bubbles escape from her mouth and you see her big wide toothy grin and  she begins scraping grime off the floor  travis i do the same  matt all right make an investigation check  travis i dont know what im looking for 23  matt 23  travis plus five  matt as the two of you are currently scraping bits of grime and algae off the ground there are  bits of plants that are growing up like lightless kelp that seems to have made some sort of a living  down here in this /none/ subterranean waterfilled chamber as youre pushing through and scraping  around your hand scoops this large bit of grime from in front of you and you can see a stone  relief at the very base of the bottom a concave spherical shape about the size of a fist  travis uh huh  matt she notices it looks at it looks at you what are you doing  travis could i try and stick my hand in my chest  matt you can  travis does it go anywhere  matt you go and jam your hand and its /none/ hitting your armor you have a fullon leather plate right there  travis i dont know what to do like the size of a fist its a sphere right  matt its about that big and you can see it is concave its about the size of the stone that  youd found  travis yeah thats in my body  sam poop it out  travis i dont know how i dont have an eject button can i summon the falchion  matt you can the falchion appears in your hand and as you do this bright yellow light /none/ is now  emanating from the center of its hilt where the eye itself is glowing with its own lanternlike  source at which point avantika is now rushing towards that thing  travis somethings about to happen and i just jam the eye into the  matt make an initiative roll because you gave her enough time to get up right next to you and  now were going to see who gets to it first  travis six  matt her hand she has now pulled the glove from her right hand as you go to thrust the /none/ hilt of  the falchion down towards it you see her hand reach out and just manage to cover the little  space first as it does you can see her body tense for a second and where her hand is this  bright familiar yellow glow seems to now spread from between her fingers sending beams off in  multiple directions her face looks aghast in shock for a second and a large bubble escapes  from her mouth she looks over to you with this dazed look and pulls her hand back there in the  palm theres /dung/ this large open wound where bloods beginning to cloud the dark water below there in  the center of this hole you can see one of the cloven stones there at which point a bunch of  these runes begin to glow in three different directions from around the base up the sides up  the chamber  the rest of you looking around suddenly see this dull blue glow begin to get brighter from within  this well you watch as these runes that you guys didnt notice except for the two of you before  begin to suddenly /none/ glow up the sides the three pillars suddenly begin to spiral and glow as all  these runes come to life avantika pulls back and looks back at her hand she looks back at you her  eyes blink for a second and she just smiles and you hear this earthshuddering soulful crack  sound rocks the entirety of the temple bubbles suddenly this one burst of air that had been  trapped in the ground below is all immediately released as one and rises the water above you can  look around and see the interior of this there /none/ is a heavy black crack in the stone of this chamber  as you guys all hear this earthshattering bam dust falls off the ceiling of this chamber from  the inside the pillars themselves still stand but there are multiple places in this chamber now  where these large black cracks now seem to have snaked their way in one instant burst across parts  of the wall  liam they are picking the lock on this safe  matt the glowing runes blink out  taliesin i think the locks picked  liam maybe they might need three /none/ theres two of three im eyeing jamedi as i say that presumably  just two of three as long as its just one maybe fjord is thinking better of it  travis i immediately start searching on the ground for another opening  matt make an investigation check  marisha maybe its not all

the water its now reaching the base of the stairs at which point as you guys beau you  and jester theres just enough water now where your buoyancy carries you off your feet and youre  now actually treading water in the chamber at which point avantika makes it to the surface with  a large gasp of air and but a few moments later fjord also breaks the surface  sam come on fjord lets get out of here  travis wait /none/ whats happening  sam the water bad water all waters bad but this is even worse  marisha what the hell happened  matt its continuing to fill the stairway thats leading upward

the other chambers the other two rooms were the two hatchery areas where you  saw the /none/ larger eggs were set  marisha right hang on  sam do i remember which one was the  marisha i do  matt make an intelligence check  sam nine oh plus six no this is not a saving throw  matt no its just straight bonus  sam plus three so 12  matt you recall it was in the chamber where youre standing and its not too far from the  stairs where you guys descended below  sam okay do i see a little door a little hole near where im standing  matt you look /none/ over to the side make a quick investigation check  sam natural 20  matt you reach over and you find it and you hit it  travis come on  matt the door slams shut and locks you in the room  sam locks me  marisha what  travis oh fuck  matt you hear a grinding on the other side of the chamber of the fountain lowering  travis oh shit  sam fountain lowering  travis right  liam so the fountain lowered but nott is trapped inside  matt nott and

slowly lower it is a slow drag down  marisha okay lets go come on  sam yeah im going to climb up  taliesin yeah  matt okay the stairway itself if you recall ends a little /none/ bit ways up and theres a bit of a  drop down to get to it it slowly comes down and does meet the floor theres a bit of a lip to get  up there now so if you ascend to the top of the staircase there is about a ten foot or so jump  where it is smooth walls before you can actually get to the top floor  marisha yeah  travis cool  taliesin well get up there and drop a rope  marisha yeah i can do that  travis lets try that  /none/ marisha lets go  sam like to make the jump do you want to jump off of yasha or anything  marisha sure  taliesin can yasha fly  marisha give me a boost the cheerleader hoist  matt yasha goes over and gives you a boost that gives you advantage on your acrobatics check to  try and parkour up the stairs and leap off the sides  marisha jesus christ  liam im going to cast dancing lights and send four globules up around the roof so that everyone  can see everything perfectly  marisha 12 on /none/ my acrobatics  matt you leap slide off the side and manage to fall down into the water next

pushing people through  matt alley ooping one after the other you grab /none/ each person and lift them up like a little  booster into the chamber one by one you guys all get up into the top now and caduceus youre too  big to get up  liam yeah caduceus hold fjords hand fjord hold his hand you got it  travis and taliesin yep  liam i cast reduce and now he is half his size  taliesin oh  travis i pull him up top  matt you pull caduceus up you guys are now in the chamber standing there theres the stairs  that lead up at which /none/ point you hear footfalls and you see coming around the corner down it  seems that the sound of the resounding crack in this temple has drawn the attention of three  yuanti they turn the corner you see one of them two snake arms a familiar sight as one of  the malisons comes down and two broodguard are there what are you doing the water is now  spilling up past out of the hole and now the top room is now starting to fill with water  travis so are we in the top level now  /none/ matt you are  travis we are yepebeb im tapped spellwise  sam im just going to just go screaming and start shooting at the first one  matt go for it  sam thats not great its a 14  matt at this point the water seems to have accelerated and has now filled the chamber as you fire  sam 16 to hit  matt all right  taliesin im casting spirit guardians and rushing them  matt okay youre now underwater you take your last breath and youve all completely been  submerged in this chamber the /none/ other yuanti you can see in the darkness below here the only bit  of light that you have are the globes still from you although are those concentration  taliesin ive got a light on my stick anyway  liam oh theyre gone then because enlarge reduce  matt yes  taliesin i would have cast light on my stick then  matt so youre casting light on your stick  taliesin anybody i dont like within 15 feet is currently getting ransacked by tiny fairies  matt okay  laughter  matt i love it whats the save /none/ on that wisdom i believe  taliesin wisdom 16  matt okay the malison succeeds the two broodguard fail roll damage on that  taliesin thats freaking out a little bit 3d8 radiant damage  matt that is correct  taliesin thats 11 counting 12 points of radiant damage  matt 12 point of radiant damage nice  liam none of that was like a melee attack or anything  taliesin no  liam because your damage is reduced since youre teeny  taliesin it doesnt theyre fairies  matt all right  taliesin im heading straight towards the exit /none/  matt what was the roll you had to hit  sam 16 to hit  matt 16 that will hit the malison you do not get sneak attack however  sam thats fine it causes nine hit points of damage  matt nice that finishes your go there  sam i would probably bonus action if i had a bonus action i would shoot again  matt id allow it because well say youre like you were standing on the water so as youre  leaning over the surface youre like squeezing it out  sam 16 to hit /none/ again  matt nice  sam another 11 points of damage  matt 11 points of damage good so i now need everyone to roll initiative  sam if im on top of the water how much space do i have  matt well now you dont anymore the water surface begins to crush underneath you and then  you have to delve underneath as it meets it its filled up and its now making its way up the  stairs towards the top of the temple so 25 to 20 anyone  marisha 20  matt all right  /none/ sam ill roll for jester terrible  matt and roll for yasha  travis i did  matt 20 to 15  travis nobody  matt 15 to ten  travis yasha got 13

water  matt it is  sam ooh how did you do that  exclamations  marisha everyone hates the underwater levels  taliesin theyre also drowning too right  matt well since theyre not officially in this now that we are in combat  travis water breathing  matt there is the nature  travis fuck /none/  marisha didnt we have some water breathing potions somewhere  matt caduceus just made his way up there theres beau and theres jamedi  taliesin someone might have a water breathing potion  matt top of the initiative order beau youre up first while youre in water movement is  considered difficult terrain if i recall attacks are made at disadvantage while in water  marisha okay yeah were definitely underwater do we see the entrance or exit ahead of us  matt those are the stairs that lead upward yes  marisha so if we just book it /none/ well go  matt yeah thats an option  marisha were just going to have these guys  matt that is entirely an option you can do  marisha well im a human with no magical abilities so im going to run  liam also the trapdoor  travis laughter yeah yeah yeah  marisha i cant do a whole lot  sam you have throwing stars  marisha pitiful noise of a throwing star flying uselessly through water  travis we havent given her the key to the trapdoor  liam ah ja son of sparta the trapdoor into /none/ this place was like a metal grate wasnt it not  fully like there were holes was it a metal grate or was it solid  matt there were holes above but they were in the ceiling and they were part of the stonework up  top there was an actual trapdoor that you had locked behind you  liam yeah but not like metal with holes for the water to go through  matt no  liam no  matt that you know of there are holes above which is where the sacrificial blood would drip  through into /none/ the fountain so what are you doing guys are you running first  marisha uh huh  matt youre swimming  marisha im swimming up  matt counting  marisha im going to spend a ki point to do step of the wind  matt beau is also  taliesin im also  travis youve made it up the top  sam is she hitting the trapdoor  matt no shes not out of the temple shes heading up the stairs shes out of the battle for  the moment  sam got it  matt so that finishes beaus /none/ turn it is now their turn they both rolled really high  initiative and you guys rolled really terribly the malisons closest are going to  taliesin is he getting within 15 feet of me  matt he is  taliesin okay then as he enters that space he has to  matt well hes still within 15 feet of you so at the top of his turn he takes the save  taliesin your speed is halved while youre within 15 feet of me and the creature enters the area  for the first time or starts its turn /none/ there  matt all right natural 20 on its save so it takes half damage it still takes damage  taliesin so the 3d8 thats 19 so half of 19  matt so nine this burst of radiant energy inside growling theres bubbles that escape  from its mouth its going to come forward and take two swipes at you fjord with both of its  serpent hands  travis okay  matt all right that is a 16 to hit  travis misses  matt and a natural 20 but it has disadvantage because its in water that is /none/ still a 19 to hit  travis that hits  matt you do manage to take from one serpent you just manage to glide out of the way in the  middle of the water the second one that is four plus three seven piercing damage including ten  points of poison damage  travis fuck ten poison  matt yeah  travis is it diluted by the water  matt unfortunately no because its straight from the fangs in your bloodstream it surges pain  in your chest you also lose a bit of air instinctively from the pain /none/ so consider now  your air supply is halved  travis okay is that half my constitution modifier  matt essentially the dc is going higher when we start getting to that depending on how long were  down here  travis fuck fuck fuck fuck  matt that ends his go now its the two broodguards  sam root guards  matt broodguards  taliesin okay so he gets into my realm one of them is within  matt theyre both already within the radius so they both have to make wisdom saves  taliesin i dont have to /none/ reroll its the same for all three right  matt at the top of the turn its a different turn so roll again  taliesin the roll i just used or a new roll  matt no its the top of their turn it happens  taliesin all right thats  matt sorry spirit guardians happens at the top of the turn it doesnt happen immediately  taliesin yeah top of their turn  matt yeah at the top of their turn so the damage they wouldve taken this turn theyve  already taken so well let that happen marking /none/ that down good to remember they both move  forward one broodguard is going to attack you nott  sam ah  matt its going to do two claw attacks and a bite attack  sam oh  matt disadvantage on each though the first one is a 15  sam miss  matt one claw attack just goes wide the other one 16  sam hit  matt one claw you manage to duck under one the other one slams into the side of your body  pushing you through the water and down into the stonework causing your /none/ hip to hit the side  thats going to do four points of slashing damage this giant serpentine mouth out of its weird  lizardlike body is going to strike out and bite you oh two tens thats 14 to hit  sam miss  matt you manage to push up and jam your hand up into its jaw and keep it from biting you and push  it away the other ones going up towards yasha yasha was not raging so the first one with  disadvantage is 15 to hit  travis that hits  matt 15 hits /none/ its going to be a claw attack ooh eight points of slashing damage  travis okay  matt next attack with a claw with disadvantage natural one that is a complete miss yasha takes  one claw and grunting barely affects it the other one she grabs its hand in the middle of the  grasp and pushes it back she grabs her sword ready now as she is going to get her blade ready  its going to bite towards the front of her jaw and chest that is 17  travis that hit  matt she takes six /none/ points of piercing damage  travis okay  matt that ends the broodguards turn yashas up next  travis yashas up next cool 14 points of damage  matt yashas also lost quite a bit of air on that turn those two hits that hit her mark down two  hits of oxygen loss on her  travis okay  matt keeping tabs on this this will come into play in a bit depending on what happens  travis where is she on the map  matt shes right there  travis uh huh shes in melee with someone  /none/ matt shes in melee with the broodguard yes  travis laughter okay she has to fight because shes going to get hit again and that would be  bad for her right now with her bonus action she would like to rage she will take two attacks at  the one that shes in melee with  matt shes in a rage she has the reckless  travis already got the reckless  matt okay so that just makes it a straight attack because she has disadvantage underwater  travis oh balls and ass okay  sam singing balls and /dung/ ass ass ass and balls  travis 19  matt definitely hits  travis 3d6 counting 13 points of damage for the first one the second one is a straight roll  the same thing 19  matt yeah hits thats just 2d6  travis 2d6 again 13 points of damage  matt that ones looking really bad after the blasts that it took from the spirit guardians and  the two strikes from yasha you can see now theres a cloud of dark crimson in the water  around it its thrashing about in pain you can see it /dung/ looking a bit woozy in the dark water that  finishes yasha you going to move at all  travis she will not move at all  matt she can move around it as long as she stays in melee she can still move around  travis well come in melee just more closer to the stairs  matt i got you thats what i figured that finishes yashas turn notts up next  sam who had i shot before  matt you had shot this one  sam can i do something unconventional here matt and undo my last /none/ shot so give him back 11 points  of damage because im holding a keg of gunpowder and theres no way i can reload a crossbow while  holding a keg of gunpowder  matt you can drop it for the moment fire it and pick it back up  sam all right  matt ill let that happen  travis good job ketchup  sam all right  matt because there is water and its already soaking its like splashing crossbow firing  sam all right  matt ill say narratively it makes sense  liam its slowly starting /none/ to sink  sam to the one whos on me all up in my grill im going to touch them and cast shocking grasp  which is a  matt melee spell attack  sam melee spell attack so i roll at disadvantage  matt with disadvantage yes  sam nine plus six 15  matt 15 hits  sam okay great  matt ac is 14  sam ive never done this before lets see here im at 5th level so its 2d8 whats a d8  taliesin its like a little there you go  sam hey eight /none/ points of damage  matt eight points of damage to it as you reach out and grab it electric shock you watch as  its tongue retracts into its head and its eyes go wide pained noise it loses some air and it  eventually shakes and pushes off your hand  liam its a verbal spell  sam a what  liam verbal you have to speak  sam does that work  matt you can do it but you lose a bunch of air to do it  sam oh boy i hate water im going to swim /none/ away as fast as i can i still have to disengage right  matt yes you do  sam i will bonus action disengage and swim around past fjord yeah around this way  matt this is as far as you can get  sam going towards the exits  matt swimming over  sam with one hand  matt that is your go nott it is now caduceus caleb and jester you guys can decide amongst  yourselves the order  taliesin ill go last  liam ill go first because im scared im going to use my air /none/ to cast expeditious retreat on  myself so i too am going to spit out some air and do this in the water that doubles my speed  which i can use a bonus action for dashing plus my movement i will swim up five feet and then  towards the stairs  matt counting that gets you about there  liam thats everything  matt youre right about there on the steps  liam im dead  matt swimming through the air okay that finishes calebs go whats jester doing  sam jester would like to probably  taliesin /none/ shes going to lose a little air but yeah is she engaged with anybody  matt shes engaged with this broodguard right there  taliesin okay then she will toll the dead  sam she will cast toll the dead  taliesin yes  matt thats a saving throw for him whats the save  sam 15 wisdom  matt that is a 13 that does not do it  taliesin thats 2d8  matt 2d12 i think  taliesin oh yeah 2d12  matt hes already taken damage  taliesin where are my 12s  liam oh question matt /none/ did you move me two groups of movement because it would be for the  bonus action action and movement so itd be one more third  matt casting the spells a bonus action  liam when you cast it you get that extra juice and then bonus action on every following round  matt right so yeah youd be up there  liam thank you  matt there you go thank you for the heads up on that  taliesin ten points  matt ten points oof yeah hes not looking good either theyre both looking pretty rough  /none/ taliesin shes going to try to get the most advantageous point towards the door as well  matt she is currently both of you since you cast spells mark five points of lost air  sam five points of lost air  liam  im just going to remember that  marisha you have five total  matt for the purposes of this challenge to keep it interesting five points before youre now  starting to make is now considered how long you can hold your breath going forward  travis oh fuck  matt each hits a minute off /none/ the ill have to look at how i worked it out here essentially at  this point now jester and nott are going to have to start making constitution saving throws each round  sam awesome  travis panicked breathing i was not prepared for this so fast  matt that finishes jesters go she moves around over there behind the side caduceus whatre you doing  taliesin im going to take a blight staff swing at that one thats right next to yasha  matt blight staff swing  taliesin right there  sam you are a tiny man /none/  matt disadvantage on the attack  taliesin oh actually thats true actually never mind im not going to do that im so  sorry im going to get them into the most advantageous position to make sure that everybody  i want to hit is within 15 feet of me  matt okay so youre going to swim up on top of the fountain  taliesin im just going to hold my breath and maintain my calm  matt is that all youre doing  taliesin yeah  matt okay ends caduceus go fjord youre up  travis wait /none/ can i fire one eldritch blast and make a melee attack  matt no its two eldritch blasts or two strikes  travis great im going to fire an eldritch blast at the dick thats with yasha  matt go for it roll for

damage  matt 11 points of damage thatll do it you hear the dull impact of the eldritch blast and the  second impact under the water in that flash of light that second sickly green glow flash in the  water one of the broodguards begins to float up limply towards the ceiling no longer alive  sam check his body for gold  travis im going to /none/ move away im going to use my 30 feet and take an attack of opportunity as i do  matt that will get you right about there on the stairs there you go thatll do youll swim  right there thats perfect it does get to swipe at you with disadvantage thats going to be nine  plus five thats 14  travis so it misses  matt it does it scrapes across your shield as you swim away quickly just barely making it that  finishes your turn fjord beau youre up  marisha okay what do i see /none/ where am i quick look around  matt youre going up the staircase but youre part way up  marisha the waters still filling  matt yeah still filling and its still above you like you can maybe catch up to the top if you  want to if you use your full movement youll get up to the top where the door is  marisha im going to keep moving upwards and while im doing that i want to take out the  50foot rope we have then i want to grab something heavy that i have ive got /none/ to have  something stupid and heavy that i dont care about and i want to tie it to the other end a  crowbar i take the crowbar and then tie it and i drop it down the well with the rope  matt downstairs you mean  marisha uhhuh  matt you tie take the crowbar and throw it behind so its like bouncing and rolls partway  down the stairs  marisha i want to take the rope and doublegrab it around me and keep hauling ass up the stairs  matt okay with that youll make /none/ it all the way to the top you get to the small inner chamber  which is now halfway to stomachfilled making it to the top you look up and you can see there is  its a little bit crouchdown there is the latch and there is the lock mechanism beneath it  marisha fuck its locked  matt yeah you locked it behind you when you guys entered the temple  travis who has the fucking key one of us has the key who has the key  marisha

two not doing anything by the way  matt when it comes to their turn one of thems dead now  taliesin no i mean our other two friends  matt the other two their turns next well get to that when he finishes his turn but one of them  is dead so theres only one other guy  taliesin okay thats fair  matt the malison in a burst of angry pixies swarming around his body is looking really hurt  as /none/ he moves around the trail of blood stays in the water behind the head as it shifts around  both of the serpent arms look up towards caduceus the source of these angry spirits and is going to  make two strikes against him  taliesin yeah  matt because youre the one right there that is 13 to hit  taliesin nope  matt second strike thats a 12  taliesin nope  matt its like 18 six 16 eight bad

just letting the fairies do the work  matt bits of green and pinkish lichen torn off and float away in the water away from the strikes  that finishes its go the other broodguard has to make another save that /none/ is a seven plus no that  does not make it so full damage on the other broodguard  travis are we getting the impression that theyre totally comfortable underwater  matt no actually  taliesin 15 points of damage  matt 15 points of damage thatll do it  travis ooh it does  matt this guy also sparks and dies in the water  marisha go jester go jester go  matt thats caduceus spell that

will doggy paddle towards the snakehand man and hit him with another zap  matt jamedi has essentially just swam around this whole thing  taliesin asshole  matt well say for the purposes of this avantika has at this point swept up and taken her turn  that she should have taken before and is going to take three strikes against the malison thats my  own fault but well see with disadvantage thats cocked that still hits because its armor  class is only 12 ten points of damage second strike with the rapier /none/ disadvantage that does  not hit the dagger strike no misses again swinging out piercing through the water with the  rapier and the dagger and just to scrape across the side of its body but most of the strikes go  wide and shes swimming around this way  taliesin is he going to take an attack of opportunity on her  matt no shes still staying in combat she moved around him but is staying engaged but is currently  looking to make another opening and then dive off back

dont use shortsword a lot so ill let it float  for a second and grab it from behind and then rake it across the back of its neck  matt as you do you pierce past all the humanoid muscles across the neck and its shoulders  immediately the water before you fills with crimson you can see it thrash for a minute its  serpent arms trying to reach behind to strike /none/ at you you swim away as they go limp and it begins  to float up so thats that you still have a little movement left  sam im going to go towards the door as much as i can  matt that is about as far as you can get with dash you can get up there so youre with fjord  make a constitution saving throw please  sam not great 12  matt you are not drowning yet but youre on the cusp  sam thats my favorite condition is not drowning yet

laughter  matt shes up with fjord and i need you to make a constitution saving throw for jester  sam seven plus nine  travis 16  sam no seven plus two equals nine  travis shit  matt caduceus i need you to make one too because you did cast a spell spirit guardians  while underwater  taliesin oh yeah /none/ thats fair i did  sam she rolled a nine  matt she rolled nine total jesters drowning you see her swimming shes choking and begins  kicking in the water before starting to  taliesin i rolled an eight  matt you rolled an eight caduceus as well they both swim towards the staircase and you see them  both beginning to clutch at their throats  taliesin can i cast i got a crazy idea  matt you used your full movement to get there  taliesin next turn can i try something  sam next turn youll /none/ be dead  matt next turn youre going to be unconscious ending your go caleb what are you doing  liam so i have three ways to move first way is the bonus action do i reach oxygen doing that  matt you can get up to the front there  liam does that get me to air  matt it gets you to the last bit of air as its about to hit the surface at the end of this  combat round basically after fjord the chamber that beau is in is now full the water has filled /none/  the entirety of the temple  liam so all the way to the tippytop  matt yes  liam oh balls ill use bonus action and movement to go as high as i can do i reach the  trap door  matt you do reach the door  liam i will pull out the wire from my spell components and try to jimmy to lock oh god i  dont know what to do im underwater yeah so i still have action so im going to try to open the lock  matt okay make a lock picking /none/ attempt  sam this will be no problem right  liam straight roll  matt no disadvantage because youre underwater  liam oh its so good natural 20 and a three thats a four  matt no thats a failure youre sticking trying to get through it no effect fjord youre up  travis okay looking around still having plenty of air in my lungs i turn around and see jester  starting to panic and i know that she has the key so i will reach out and grab her face and bring  her into a kiss and /none/ i will blow all of my air into her lungs  sam are you upside down right now  travis shape of water  sam oh yes  matt she is no longer drowning but you have to make a con save at the end of your turn  travis okay fair enough  matt thats your action to do that you breathe some of your air into her you still have movement  marisha he selfishly wants the door unlocked  travis ill try and swim up towards the top  matt you make it halfway up actually no /none/ because you have full move dont you  travis full movement  matt you get almost to the top not fully but almost to the top constitution saving throw please  travis nine  matt you sir are considered drowning  liam i lost five of those hoohas for casting a spell you said so do i need to make a  constitution throw  matt yes you do  liam okay lets all die together 13  matt youre fine that brings around to the top there beau the water fills the gap  marisha take one last deep /none/ breath going to drop down and going to use that nope the rope is  attached to me going to drop down and see if i can go for jester  matt okay so youre going to pull jester up shes conscious so youre going to get her closer  marisha yeah can i take her and yank her up with me  matt sure you go down takes you ill say two movements to get down there and you pull her part  way up are you using your ki point for step of the wind  marisha sure /none/ my last ki point  matt last ki point will do that that will get her halfway up the stairs because im saying  pulling her the dragging motion is half movement so that will get you down to her yeah  youll get her part way up the stairs about halfway up toward where the top chamber is  marisha that helps whatever i can do i guess  liam if there was air where beau was wouldnt there be air where caleb was  marisha no you were below me i think  liam im hasted almost and /none/ i just blasted up to the top of the temple  matt it did okay no i would say that there was enough air  liam then i would have inhaling then i failed the lock picking  matt thank you so youre fine ends beaus turn that brings us to yasha avantika has also swam up  and jamedi is now gathering as well jamedi and avantika both grab caduceus body who is  drowning and begin pulling him up the stairs behind them  marisha thats good thats nice of them  travis yasha will head towards the /none/ door and wait for it to open shes going to use her movement to  go up  matt yasha gets up there to the top yashas now in there waiting there in the chamber theres  the gate below getting ready looking around trying to get people to move upward that finishes  her go nott  sam i will grab jesters horns and pull and go up as fast as i can  matt you use half your movement to catch up to jester where beau is and then you grab her with  the little bit of /none/ movement you move her an additional five feet before your movement is done  you can attempt to bonus action dash  sam bonus action dash sure yeah  matt you get another 15 feet you get her near the top of the staircase on the top floor that  ends your turn nott now it is jesters calebs and caduceus turn caduceus you are unconscious  taliesin i am unconscious ah man  matt i need you to make a death save at the top of your turn i need to keep reminding myself that  death saves are /none/ at the top of the turn not in the  taliesin i know i was just sitting on a spell that apparently i didnt know that i was going to  lose the spell so im throwing away my plans i had an emergency exit and now i cant use it its  all right fuck it 14  matt success on the save that finishes caduceus turn caleb and jester  liam im taking a breath of air caleb would have just rebounded back down and swam i use bonus  action if that gets me to them good /none/ if not i will use bonus action plus movement to get to them  which i would assume it would get me there then i help nott i will continue to drag jester up  towards the surface  matt between all of you guys jester and you all manage to make your way up the top and jesters  turn jester fumbles through her sack pulls up the key and gets it so  sam so it works  matt this is how the ending of the first poseidon movie should have happened  laughter  travis first poseidon /none/ movie yeah  matt because all of this water pressure just built up at the top of this temple suddenly  released as the latch and this geyser of water thrusts all of you rapidly out the top  sam money shot  marisha groaning oh god  matt you all get shot about a good 15 20 feet up  travis oh no  matt you have a look down at the temple which you can now see these large cracks that have set  in the sides where bits of water are pouring out through small cracks now /none/ this large geyser thrusts  in the air and you all began to plummet and fall  liam i cast feather fall on myself on nott on jester on beauregard and on fjord  matt okay  liam its my last spell slot  marisha take cad take cad im good  liam i already did it it doesnt matter its what i did its who i know not what hit points exist  sam i cast feather fall on everyone else  cheering  taliesin thank god that would have been the end of me  travis that would /none/ have been it  taliesin that would have been number two done right there instant tko  sam i throw a wet feather  laughter  matt perfect  taliesin fuck man  matt as you all begin to drift down the geyser slows the pressure releases but now water is  just pouring out of the sides of the temple and its completely flooding the city you watch as  yuanti that are rushing up the side of the temple are washed down into the basin that is now the  center of the city streets you can see /town/ now that the city is being thrust up the side some have  moved to the top of buildings and are glancing up and seeing you guys as you begin to descend now  youre about to hit the top of this and there is now a perpetual flow of water coming out of the  top of this temple what are you going to do  sam were about to hit the top of the temple or all the sides of it  matt on the sides of it you guys are just slowly drifting down towards whats essentially /none/ a raging  travis water slide  matt rapid water slide on all ends  marisha it ends with the mob of angry people who want to kill us probably  matt correct  liam i can see that  taliesin jester at the very least is going to cast spare the dying is going to grab me in the  feather fall and cast spare the dying  matt okay  taliesin thank you  travis im unconscious i think  taliesin i dont think you made it to unconsciousness because we burst before your turn  travis okay /none/ okay  sam no youre unconscious  travis i started drowning  matt yeah  marisha but i dont know if youre making death saves is he stable  matt no because we havent gone to his turn yet youve begun drowning and you guys got thrust out  so you managed just catch your breath because it didnt come back to your turn yet that very next  turn before jester got it opened youve would have been down  travis yeah  matt so you just caught your breath  travis i did okay okay  matt the /none/ very last minute basically as the darkness began to take your vision you are thrust  out and your eyes go wide again as you see this sunlight above you as your air rushes back into  your lungs and then suddenly begin to drift slowly down looking below you can see the city and the  entire landscape of this strange village below you  marisha how the fuck do we get out of this  matt so what are you guys doing  liam they are on all sides the people down below or are down on one /none/ side of them  matt they are on all sides like the entire city surrounds the temple you guys only came up on one  side the water is pouring down on all sides  travis lets us just get down and out of here  taliesin yeah and i dont think that spirit guardians doesnt go down when i go unconscious  matt any spells thats concentration is lost  taliesin its not concentration oh it is concentration isnt it where is it  yeah it is concentration fuck god damn it  travis lets just get back on /none/ the ship  liam im paddling through the air towards the direction we came from  marisha haul ass  sam as were in the air im going to take the shield that i stole off my back and slide it  under caduceus butt like a  laughter  sam a sled like a toboggan and hold it there so when he lands hell just slide  matt okay so as you all begin to slowly drift and try paddling your way through the air im  going to say for the purpose of this well make this a /none/ group skill check everyone make a  dexterity check to try and comb your way through the air enough using your body to try and guide  your plummeting  travis 12  marisha 24  liam drei  sam it doesnt matter youre out  matt two successes failure  taliesin no im not im unconscious  taliesin im stable thats right im unconscious never mind  matt youre fine  sam natural 20  matt success three successes one failure jester  sam 18 plus  matt success on jester for yasha  travis 18  matt success /none/ all right so only one fail as a group that is a group success so you all manage  to just yep and both jamedi and avantika are fine so you all manage to just barely push your  way in a certain direction you all begin to drift down  sam like a skydiving team  matt yeah slowly making your way through until eventually the surface of the water the rushing  sound gets louder and louder as you all strike it as you do it carries you down in this rapid  gooniesstyle waterslide youre all coasting /town/ down the side of the stones and elements of the stone  just barely scraping and clipping the back of your butt and your back and youre like oh god its  not enough to damage you but youre going to be bruised as shit in the morning but youre  coasting down you can see as the city is coming towards you the water is now pouring through and  snaking through the city no pun intended there are groups of yuanti that have clamored up onto  the buildings and are currently trying to pull themselves out of /none/ the water and help others get up  out of the middle of this strange flood that has taken over the center of their civilization  sam the waters still coming right  matt its still pouring out of the temple it seems  sam oh my god the island is sinking  travis potentially if this an island  sam its a turtles back  marisha turtle its only a turtle  sam its the cajun turtle  matt orlys vengeance  travis you fools  matt you guys coast down you hit the bottom and you can see /none/ now where the water hits and it snakes  through it curves back to the right and the left which path are you going to try to guide towards  travis right  matt you have an unconscious sledding furbolg  taliesin youre sliding me basically  sam i feel like im behind you because ive got water walking on so im like  matt you do its like brrrrrrrrr  liam i have keen mind i would call out exactly the right way to go  matt its almost like curling  taliesin thank you for that  liam /none/ i have keen mind i would know the way that would lead us towards the way we came  matt yes you would so youre guiding and shouting directions  liam ja that way go that way  matt calebs guiding you guys you guys move around the side riding the water at this point  the flood of water begins to subside a bit its still guiding you through but you can see now the  initial burst and rushing of the rapids is not a continuous thing there is some sort of a tapering  to it you /town/ guys just managed to have been there for the initial burst at this point you guys  coast around one side come round and youre now going down to the center of the street where you  previously hid and basically like muscled two of them into a doorway after stabbing and killing  them rapidly youre now gliding through the street along with the flow of the water trying to  keep above the surface caduceus being pushed along by little nott going thudding at this  point from one of the nearby building tops you see two of /none/ these centurion yuanti see you guys  pass beneath begin giving out a call and then shouting over in their direction pointing towards  you your presence is now aware to at least a handful of nearby yuanti their weapons were  either lost in the stream or not wielded of course but theyre beginning to pull out their  things you guys continue to ride this forward youre leading the path the way you can go i  need everybody to make a general acrobatics check to try and guide their body through the water in  the direction /none/ that caleb is shouting this is a group check  marisha natural 20  travis natural 20 yasha rolled a five  matt those count as double successes  taliesin oh my god  liam unnatural 20  matt still good  sam 23 and jester rolled a 23  matt you guys got this shit like i dont even yeah youre just out  sam jesters been trying to make her way towards him if possible towards him i dont know if she  can get there  matt i think what did she roll  sam she rolled /none/ a 23 i mean she rolled a 19 plus four  matt ill say with that higher roll shes been able to make her way over towards the side of you  guys coasting along  taliesin she doesnt actually have anything that can wake me up right now  sam she does shes trying to touch you so she can cast cure wounds on you  taliesin oh my god she has one left doesnt she holy shit i forgot about that  matt all righty so jester just manages to just make it over to the edge of /none/ you as the water  which was about maybe with the flash flood about three and a half four feet deep is now  descending to about two foot so some of you your feet manage to catch the floor beneath but the  water is still rushing rather fast you can continue to just go with the flow of it or try  and gather your footing but its up to you you can cast cure wounds on caduceus  sam as jester im going to cast cure wounds on little man  matt a d4 plus  taliesin /none/ im not even little anymore  sam as jester youre always little to me  taliesin oh im up im up oh  matt so go to roll d4 plus your wisdom modifier sorry d8 for cure wounds  sam youre right one point plus four is five  matt youre at five hit points you come into consciousness on a sled over water  taliesin did i lose all my hit points when i went unconscious  matt yes when youre drowning it brings you to zero hit points  taliesin okay i had zero then well fuck  /none/ matt riding the water eventually you guys manage to keep it going are you going with the water or  are you fighting it  marisha might as well go with the flow  sam is the water going the way we want to go  matt mostly yeah  liam yeah i would be calling out this whole time which ways we want to go to get out ja  matt so you just continue with the flow of it the flow eventually comes to a stop on the outside  of the city maybe about 15 or 20 /none/ feet from the treeline where you first entered  travis got to go  marisha keep moving  travis caduceus in the front everyone behind him  taliesin im going to cast really quickly since i have nothing else left im going to cast  disguise self and look like one of the lizard people  matt okay  travis yasha will be actually up front just in front of you  sam we need caleb up front too to guide us  matt as a note all the makeup has been washed off  taliesin oh no  matt /none/ sorry as you guys are rushing towards the treeline you hear the shouting in the distance  you glance over now that the water level has stopped you can look behind and you can see  probably two dozen or so yuanti have now begun to give chase theyre about a hundred feet behind  you but they saw you exit and theyre on their way giving chase now were turning this into a  skill challenge chase as you guys are making your way through as you guys are now charging into the  jungle youre not doing stealth /none/ so your speed isnt as slow which took you a day and a half or  so to traverse this jungle to the center unless you want to keep stealthy if its charging through  travis nope  marisha run  travis loudest thing you ever heard  liam raiders of the lost ark were just cutting through the jungle  matt full speed great we have six rounds of this challenge  marisha six rounds  matt correct success and failure do different things who wants to offer something to help in  this skill challenge much like the /none/ resurrection challenge in this game think of a creative way  that you can help your progression  travis is it going to be dexterity checks  matt it depends on what you want to do  liam question are we under 10 minutes since we shot out the top of that pimple  matt youre still under 10 minutes yes  liam so im still sped up and im going to run at the front and just shout out directions and  call out holes things in the ground to look out for im going to lead the charge /none/  matt okay i will say for that make a survival check with advantage  liam okay natural 20  matt thats one thats two successes on that one well add to that so keeping a close eye  caleb is darting ahead into the jungle shouting out various issues jamedi is trying to keep up  with you but behind is also helping you keep an eye and shouting out traps that he had helped you  bypass before and making sure you guys dont fall off the path that you had made your way through  that he /none/ had set on his map beforehand that had avoided the bigger dangers in the jungle between  the two of you you manage to get a fair bit in there and the sound of the chasing yuanti does  not seem to be getting louder which is good thats one who does the next offer  travis i was going to say yasha can take out the magicians judge and start cleaving machetestyle  through the brush making it far easier for us to move  matt okay yasha going to push at the front which with a higher speed /none/ than you she can  definitely do and begin to carve through swarths of the jungle to make it an easier passage for  her make an athletics check please  travis advantage or straight up  matt straight up unless shes raging  travis oh shes rageclearing  matt okay ill allow that for this  travis 21 22  matt thats a success yashas now ahead of the group shes carving through you can see there  are bits when you come up to the front where there is just dense clusters of tangled vines  where the /none/ path you are taking caleb stops you at the front because you deviated a little from the  path where you were because you were running too fast at this point youre not used to this level  of acceleration for an extended period of time right at the end of your expeditious retreat  right as the spell is about to fade you come to that group of vines at that point youre about to  spin and warn everybody and all you see is this blur of yasha carve through them they all fall to  the ground /none/ the path before you is open she goes go all of you just keep running in that  direction yashas continuing that whos taking the next bit  taliesin ill use thaumaturgy to create the sound of a rushing group of us but throw it  happening im going to move us off into the jungle in the other direction you can create  instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range this is a rumble  within 30 feet a rumble of thunder  matt yeah rumble of thunder you can do it has limitations /none/ to the sound you can make but you can  make a rumble of thunder  taliesin i cant make it the cry of a raven such as is what it says  matt oh such as i misunderstood what youre saying yeah there are certain sounds you can  make the sound of a whole group  taliesin im making the sound of people rummaging through  matt okay so rustling in the bushes it makes sense  taliesin yes im pushing it away from us and moving us in that direction  matt make a deception check  /none/ taliesin come on man not some sucky stuff ah not bad 15  matt 15 thats just barely a success  taliesin ill take just barely today  matt all right so with that you hear the chanting sounds the war cry of yuanti behind  you and it begins to divert slightly getting them off track just a little bit all right whos  taking the next bit who hasnt offered one  travis oh theres six of these i thought there was three  matt theres six stages of this  sam everyone has to have an offer /none/  marisha is there anyone tracking us pretty closely yet  matt from what you can tell not at the moment but if you wanted to use your turn to do something  to see if somebody is what do you want to do your crit earlier gave a lower dc for the next  check so that helped out tremendously  marisha im going to take the rest of my ball bearings and dump them out as we run  matt okay as a note youre in a lush jungle probably not going to do much on this thats /none/ a  hard smooth floor type scenario i mean you can if you want to  marisha nott do you have anything you want to offer  sam i have one thing but  marisha i dont know if any of my ideas are good  sam we dont have eyes on the yuanti do we  matt no not at the moment  sam i would wait until they get closer before i do my thing maybe jester can  travis theres two dozen of them i dont want to get that close  sam well i dont either /none/ but if they do id be ready for something  taliesin i have something else but id be curious if somebody else has something  marisha ive got an oil flask i could drop down some fire but dont think it would work well either  sam well sure so ill just yell to beau beau repeat after me fluffernutter im going to throw  the keg of gunpowder behind us  marisha i go fluffernutter and take my ninja star and go floof  sam wait is it on fire it has to be on fire  liam i /none/ see it and use the glove of blasting to fire three scorching rays  marisha i dont have fire i use my fists  liam three scorching rays  matt you have a second level spell to use  liam no the glove i havent used  matt the glove yeah you do thats right okay  marisha i could have used the bottle rockets  matt okay this is a combined maneuver here id say for the success of this this is going to be a  combination of your make a roll with your ranged spell attack  /none/ liam yeah theres three rays  matt yeah you can go ahead and make a general strength roll  sam general strength that was my nickname in high school 15  matt nice roll okay you manage to lob it behind with a fair amount of strength so it goes about  ten 15 feet behind you  sam then if i can i would push it with a little mage hand with a little extra top spin on it  matt okay it does a little whirl it whoof through the air and bounds a bit into the jungle /none/  behind you  liam how do i handle this is this a skill check  matt are you detonating it just 15 20 feet behind you or are you waiting for something else  to come out  liam no im just waiting for nott to throwing it back at them yeah  matt correct but theyre not visible yet though you dont know where you are  liam well i reacted to fluffernutter being shouted and seeing it  sam so blow it up well make a wall of fire  liam so i will track it and /none/ then hit it as it struck the ground  matt okay what did you roll  liam well i rolled three times because theres three rays do i use the spell modifier for this  or not  matt you do  liam okay so the highest roll was a 20 and then the second highest was a 12 so probably of the  three rays probably only one  matt what was the second one sorry 20 and 12 were the two highest  liam i rolled a 20 a 7 and a 12  matt got you okay /none/ so the two hit so roll damage the damage is going to be important here  because it is a waterlogged container of black powder and may not be enough to truly ignite or  cause an explosion here or burn through the barrel well see  sam but the barrel you said was mostly intact  matt its intact yeah but its wet  sam yeah but what about inside  matt its soaked through a little bit  sam barrels are waterproof you keep beer in them  matt this isnt a beer barrel  liam total of /none/ 12  matt thatll be enough all right so as it darts behind you watch the vision of caleb spinning  behind and releasing the glove in front with these three arcs of flame one of them hits a nearby  bush and sets it aflame the other two one of them hits the barrel and sends it arcing once  more and the second one hits it detonates and you guys feel this blast of hot wind behind you as  your hair gets blown before your face the entire jungle around you lights for a moment with bright /none/  yellowwhite light and there in that space now is a couple of trees that have now set aflame and a  section of darkened crater on the ground where the barrel was the loud blast echoes across the  jungle of the island around you  sam i just turn beau around like shouting that was amazing how did you do that with a throwing star  marisha shouting i think these are magic throwing stars i think i bought magic throwing stars  matt ill consider that a success you guys keep rushing you assume wherever the yuanti /none/ were  theyre a little unsettled by this large explosion in the direction of where theyre travelling and  it slows them down a bit as they try and coast around the area where the damage is however  there seems to be a lizardmen hunting party now that is in the jungle a little ways ahead of you  marisha what oh jeez  sam this thing wont stop  matt you guys have been running for the better part of two hours now its a ways through this  jungle to get back to the shore so first /none/ and foremost i need everyone here to go ahead and  make a constitution saving throw please  taliesin my favorite saving throw  travis 23 for fjord 20 for yasha  matt good  marisha 11  matt okay  liam one  matt you take a point of exhaustion there caleb  sam ten  matt just barely succeeded  sam jester rolled an eight  matt one point of exhaustion  sam okay conditions  taliesin 18  matt all right youre fine  travis jamedi  matt avantika takes a point of exhaustion  travis oh /none/ shit  matt all right you guys continue onward since youre just running through this jungle best you  can full sprint it manages to keep ahead but there is a threat of exhaustion as you continue to  move so you now begin to hear the sound this familiar clacking guttural noises sound of the  lizardmen that you saw in the jungle before whos doing what  travis laughing thats amazing  sam were still doing this  matt youre still doing it you had four total successes in the round you had one critical  success which /none/ improved  sam we hear a hunting party we see a hunting party  matt you dont see them there but you hear them in the direction you are apparently the noise and  the explosion caught the attention of a nearby lizardmen hunting party  marisha i have these bottle rockets if you can mage hand them away and distract them away from us  with another popping sound  sam and set them off at the same  marisha well i can light them you throw and you take it further  sam sure  marisha okay  /none/ sam sure yes  marisha well call it  sam lets do it  taliesin certainly not the weirdest  matt so youre doing the exact same thing with a different item its going to have a higher dc but  you can do it its your call  marisha well gee when you put it like that  matt im just saying its something you can do you want to do it  marisha i dont know i feel deeply shamed by my suggestion now  matt no no its a great suggestion im just letting you know progressively /none/ doing the same  thing over and over again its going to continue to raise the dc  sam you know jester hasnt done anything yet she still has a thaumaturgy she could do you can  cause harmless tremors in the ground but it doesnt say where oh within 30 feet yeah  thats no good  matt its a cantrip cantrips dont have all that power there  sam yeah they dont never mind she uses it to alter the appearance of her eyes for one minute  laughter  sam she makes them black  matt there /none/ you go anybody else  travis i can try to assume the form of one of the lizard people in case they make eyes on us  matt okay  taliesin ive already done that as well  matt two lizardfolk in the group now all right  travis i have no spell left to help  matt doesnt have to be abilities it can be just whatever you think you would do in the area to help  marisha i know you just dont have a lot youve used all those things  sam im going to put up /none/ the cloak and just sneak we hear them  matt you heard the hunting call of them  sam in a direction that we can identify  matt yes somewhere in the front and to the right of where you were as you guys were running through  the jungle  sam okay ill just say stay here and im going to put up the hood and im going to dodge off in  that direction stealthily  matt okay are you guys stopping for nott then  travis yes  matt okay  sam do i have to roll /none/ for stealth i assume  matt yes you do with advantage because of your cloak  sam okay so thats 22  matt okay so you are successfully stealthed this is not technically a success because this  isnt actually helping the endeavor but you do manage to move ahead and at your speed you come  upon the hunting party you can see now there are about six lizardmen with nets shields and spears  that are currently making their way in the direction of near where your party is currently  waiting for you the more time that /none/ passes the closer the yuanti get to your party  sam im going to cast mage hand theyre holding nets and what else  matt four of them have shields and spears and two of them have spears with nets and the other  ones have nets apparently tucked behind their back theyre out here to catch and drag things back  sam okay jesus i got nothing man im just going to try to mage hand and trip the guy in the  back with his own net just pull it down a little  matt okay make an /none/ arcana check  sam arcana check  matt yes this is to see if you can influence the magical nature of your cantrip strong enough to  try and trip up one of them  sam okay arcana check is a 20  matt okay thats barely a success because thats not a very effective plan necessarily  sam sure didnt know what else to do but okay  matt one of them gets tripped up in the net and the other ones look back at it and start clacking  at it and theyre complaining about the one guy /none/ that fell behind like an asshole and is slowing  down their trajectory not a lot of distraction you can return you figure you bought a little bit  of time for your party but not much  sam okay  matt okay  sam i guess thats all ill do i dont know what else to do i you know what im going to fuck  it im going to cast message and tell caleb go im going to go hey fucktards over here and im  going to just draw their attention  travis oh no  matt /none/ okay  liam i tell the group shes doing something stupid shes distracting them i have an idea but  i dont want to leave her lets go i start trudging through the jungle towards the direction  i think is the right one  matt you all continue following caleb they are now seemingly turning on you snarling  sam im going to bolt double dash fast as i can go away  matt all right youre darting through the jungle  sam not back towards my friends but like  matt kind of in the adjacent direction  /none/ sam perpendicular  matt okay no worries theyre giving chase theyre following behind you they know this  jungle very well and can traverse it very easily however youre quick and youre small for that  well say two of them throw ranged spears at you thats a 15 to hit  sam nope  matt and a 12 nope both spears impact to the nearby trees and you keep running trying to make  it through eventually you hear the sound of  sam drink run drink and run  matt yeah gulping as youre going you hear the /none/ footfalls breaking through of nearby brush and  glance over afraid to see yuanti and you can see the shapes of your group maybe 25 or 30 or so  feet to your left  liam are we able to tell the direction where the lizardmen are in relation to nott or just  yuanti on us  matt not at the moment you guys are just running i mean the lizardmen you knew were off  to the front and right and you guys darted at an angle and youre guiding them still in the  direction toward the /none/  liam im saying we all hear the yuanti or nott hears the yuanti coming  matt no  sam i saw you guys through the woods but theyre behind me  matt yeah you havent seen any of the yuanti youve gotten enough gain on them but theyve  gotten a bit closer but they havent appeared yet  liam okay but i can tell the direction nott is running or moving  matt no youre just  liam youve seen us we havent seen you  sam yeah  matt correct  liam never mind  matt you /none/ guys continue to run continue to run continue to run everyone make another  constitution saving throw please  taliesin groaning  marisha okay okay okay okay  travis 12 for fjord nine for yasha  matt yasha takes a point of exhaustion fjord barely succeeds dc goes up by two every time we  do this  taliesin oh fuck really  marisha 20 total  matt 20 success secondary point of exhaustion your speed is now halved  sam whisper oh my god  matt caleb is now winded and now starting to drag the group back a /none/ bit  sam one point of exhaustion jester succeeded i rolled a 14  taliesin 16 she was 16 ten  matt ten point of exhaustion caduceus  taliesin i yeah  matt anyone who has one point of exhaustion your ability checks are at disadvantage right now  sam damn  matt two points your speed is halved  travis i remember that well  taliesin i have the ability to carry a large amount because of my size can i piggyback and not  get too much of a roll if i throw caleb on my back  /none/ matt i will make this one of your checks  taliesin okay  matt make an athletics check  taliesin oh man  matt you have disadvantage because  travis or you could have yasha do it  taliesin ill have ya yeah no thats a better idea because i was five hit points maybe not  matt okay so you share the idea with yasha yashas going to attempt to  travis athletics  matt does yasha have a point of exhaustion  travis she does  matt so disadvantage on her athletics check  marisha i want to /none/  travis its her biggest modifier  matt one second please because this is going to attribute to her  travis oh a natural 20 and a 12 so thats 19  matt 19 thats a success  taliesin sigh of relief  matt that puts us at six total successes  taliesin oh my god  marisha were all clear  matt across the checks here yasha throws caleb firemancarry over the shoulder and you guys begin  running and running and running for this next additional hour now as you guys are charging  through following the path /none/ well say youve gone three or four hours of straight sprint through the  forest sprint stop run youre breathing heavy youre sweating profusely your body is aching  your mouth is just filled with the worst cottonmouth youre dehydrated you can hear the  yelping of approaching lizardmen and yuanti as you see the light begin to slowly break ahead of  you through the trees as the treeline begins to thin and the faintest bit of blue is visible  within a few more moments you break through the treeline and youve found yourself back to the  /none/ white sand beaches of urukaxl there as you come out to the sand the hot reflection of the sun  against the light you can see now the sun is close to setting at this point the sky itself has  gotten slowly darker as youve moved past the white beaches have now come to a faint dull yellow  and orange with the coming sunset light nott emerges from the nearby brush  sam panting  matt shes catching up with the rest of you guys  sam panting im exhausted  travis on the ship on the ship /none/  sam theyre right behind me  matt you guys look and there are the two rowboats that are still right where you left them  liam yashas moving towards the beach calebs going to just start firing firebolt after firebolt  at the treeline ive a 120 foot range and is going to set the jungle on fire behind us  matt okay i will say roll an arcana check for me  liam natural one  matt unfortunately as a cantrip the perpetual fiery quality of it it can do bursts of damage  and plops of flame /none/ but unfortunately the treeline here is too humid the air here is too wet and  none of the trees are catching however you manage to get over yasha throws you onto one of  the two rowboats you guys get on too at this point you can now see breaching one side of the  treeline the yuanti the other side a group of lizardmen they come to a head and look at each  other and look at you half of each group charges at each other  sam oh yes  matt while the other half begins /none/ to charge towards the rowboats  travis groaning oh fuck  marisha at the rowboat  sam start the motor start the motor  sam ripcord noises  marisha how close are they  matt theyre about 40 feet away its a 40 foot rush  matt theyre going to catch up you guys push off and youre rowing out youre about ten now  15 or 20 feet off the edge they catch up they start getting their shortbows ready at this  point you hear cannon fire  travis yeah yeah yeah  taliesin oh thank god  /none/ travis volley that shit  matt cannon fire bursts of sand columns of sand go flying into the air and you watch as one  lizardman scream a yuanti bursts off to the side you look over you can see the flashes of  light on the sides of the squalleater  travis oh so sick  matt as volley after volley of cannon fire is blown towards the edge of  the shoreline a couple close calls as its not a perfect aiming implement you see as you dodge  out of the way as splashing big burst of /none/ water some of the yuanti dive into the water and are  now swimming through trying to come back you can see their serpentine bodies making their way  in your direction  travis caleb and i are picking them off eldritch blast and  marisha yeah  matt hitting in the water as you do  marisha im on the edge doing polearm duty like croc hunting  travis no no  marisha grunting  taliesin yeah im just  matt eventually you guys get far enough away from the edge it becomes less advantageous for  them to /none/ focus on you and than to focus each other through the cacophony of explosions and the rest  are wrestling the much larger force of both the lizardpeople that live on this island and the  yuanti that have given chase are now focused on each other and this conflict is now spilling back  into the jungle and away from the beach as you all very sore make your way towards the  squalleater and now you can see offshore the mist or the mistake has also been pulled off the  shore seemingly repaired enough to be at /none/ least semiserviceable though its only been a day or  so and the repairs probably arent longhaul permanent but for the first time in a very very  long time this day you all take a deep breath some of you taking a short nap as you row  yourself to the sunset over the distant far shores of the ocean towards the ships that mean safety  and thats where were going to take a break  groaning  sam oh my god  travis oh my god why did we not take a short rest right when we /none/ started laughter  sam youre the one who its your thing  travis i know i know  i didnt think about it damn it  marisha yeah not feeling that whole time  travis that was gnarly  travis dude youre good youre good youre good water is your friend youre good  taliesin this is yeah that was a lot  laughter  matt okay then damn  marisha ive never felt more useless  travis oh fuck me  sam magical prime time  travis that was a teacher  marisha curse you  travis that was /none/ a teacher  sam do we really only have mutterfingers  taliesin its only a teacher if we actually learn from these mistakes  sam blob boffers and words  travis no theres also smudge and  taliesin i have a giant pile of stuff in the other room  sam i want meeses meanutmutter mubs  laughter  liam its all they had at smogschmeade  sam i dont even know what that means  matt i dont either anyway friends were going to go to our break here in just a moment well  return but in the /none/ meantime we have another wyrmwood giveaway this fantastic delightful  padauk dice vault which is magnetized opens up to keep all your dice possibly even a couple  miniatures in there wellkept beautiful orange color for the halloween season that were still  celebrating today damn it  marisha yeah  matt so to enter this you need to jump over to the critical role twitch chat thats  twitchtvcriticalrole and enter the keyword once the keyword is hydra hydra well come  back at the break for a winner once again only people in the united states and canada /none/ excluding  quebec can enter were working on it but well come back with a winner here in just a moment so  sit tight be right back  cheering and groaning  break  matt and welcome back everybody  singing  matt laughter so we have a winner of the fantastic padauk dice vault i believe thats how  its pronounced or not i might be messing it up but regardless the winner is fmiller8 fmiller8  congratulations  travis fmiller8 yeah man  matt well get this vault sent out to you asap  cheering  matt /none/ all right  taliesin can we ever not look  travis can we just automatically get a short rest just because that was the most  marisha yeah do we just collapse  travis heinous strenuous  marisha of exhaustion as soon as we hit the deck  matt nope  marisha oh cool  matt because youre rowing to the ship and theres still the occasional cannon fire of the  final shots sent off to deflect any interest in following or pursuing you towards the boats as  you guys are trying to make some distance here you /none/ look over at avantika who has her one  ungloved hand you can see the gap where the open wound theres just a little bit of blood  trickling down her forearm where the eye once was she looks at it closes her fist closes her eyes  and you feel the rowboat suddenly pick up speed and you watch as the water and the waves now give  an additional thrust like the ocean itself is rising and pushing the boat forward and you watch  avantika open her eyes and smile and looks over at fjord and goes /none/ well better luck next time  huh the boat is now speedboating across the surface of the water the other rowboat left  behind in its wake  liam one die roll man one die roll  matt one die roll  liam highpitched i said bi  matt laughter as you approach the outskirts of the squalleater the rope ladders are thrown over  the edge down into the water with that you all eventually climb up onto the top as some of the  crew goes over to retrieve and ratchet up and bring the rowboats back onto /none/ the ship now you all  clamber onto the deck of the large ship and take a moment of respite and breather as your the crew  of the squalleater there awaits you can see there bouldergut the large ogre chief stands there arms  crossed with the stretched leather tunic now strapped on each side of her torso avantika rises and  vera waits her righthand soothsayerlike assistant or for this would be considered the  deckhand and spiritual leader of this ship  sam can i pause you for one second matt  matt yes you may  /dung/ sam did you all fucking take off your costumes  marisha yeah  taliesin yeah  travis no were still wearing ours are  liam is that superglued on or something  sam no  matt i took mine off  sam that i saw  laughter  marisha it got uncomfortable  sam yeah yeah  travis it was bad luck  marisha you have clothes underneath your fiber  sam do i  matt laughter thats true if there was any of us i would not be able to truly  travis uh huh  matt be certain /none/  travis there are imprints being left on that chair  matt yeah  laughter  sam sticky butt peel off peel off  marisha little hearts  sam sorry matt  matt its okay so as you all bring yourselves onto the ship here vera approaches avantika and  helps her to her feet and says like so how did it go tell us avantika shows her hand twas a  resounding success i would say that our new compatriots have proven their worth with flying  colors she goes and gives a clapping ow ow ow ow ow /none/  laughter  matt and i do believe you see jamedi sitting on the ground and goes yes you have earned  what our contract assured you please vera if you could retrieve the payment vera leaves and  in a moment comes back with a small chest and hands it over to jamedi who sets it into his  pouch and satchel he stands up for a second nods his head i hope you understand that with all  due respect this is our last time working together the captain says aye i understand  but it is your /none/ loss there is always more work for you where would you like to be dropped off  sam in a graveyard  matt at this point vera says captain at this moment it appears that we have maybe 11 days of  supplies given that our crew has now swelled as such we could probably make it back to darktow to  also complete the repairs on the mist as it is seaworthy but i do not know how long so that  would be my recommendation maybe making a stop or two along the way whatevers close by the /none/  captain considers very well i guess well make our way westward onto darktow to get repairs done  to supply up and should you wish to stay make our way to the next leg of our journey who knows  it seems that you are up for your own rewards to be reaped eh  travis indeed such a mighty display on the way back i feel like i would be left wanting if i  didnt try and pursue the same sort of glory  matt of course well these gifts are paltry once ukotoa is truly free /none/ then the true blessing  can be given  travis captain may i ask you knew of this location already do you have a lead on another  matt i have a lead on someone that should be in darktow that would be able to with the right  amount of coin give us the information we seek hopefully if not well be sitting here with our  thumbs up our asses but ive paid well enough and this person has come through before so  fingers crossed eh  travis indeed  matt regardless i think we could all /none/ use a bit of rest eh looks over to caduceus  taliesin i would be amenable at this point  matt understood get jeremiah to get food cooking immediately i think a fine meal and a  full nights rest is in order friends im impressed and im thankful that youve not only  upheld your side of the bargain you proved yourselves as quite formidable mercenaries i mean  no disrespect to some of my crew but when we get back to darktow she looks at some of the crew  turn around some of them maybe well deal /none/ with some trade off eh send some of them over to  the mist and maybe youll stay with me for a while  travis we would certainly entertain that very notion its hard to think past any sort of a rest  marisha sorry i thought that was hypothetical and that we were talk about that later which we  should do  matt very well then we will get some sleep and on the morrow we will discuss how much money we  can make together well probably make a stop or two along the way if youre /none/ interested bring up  the map and see what you want to do when weve had a bit of rest maybe a glass of wine  travis of course  matt all right go rest sleep i shall do the same she walks back into her quarters vera  staying there on the deck jamedi makes his way down to his quarters what would you like to do  sam go to our quarters i guess  travis could we have a conversation near the bow of the ship perhaps away from ears is it empty  towards the bow /none/  matt you can find a bit that seems a little more remote but there are deckhands there are folks  that are always keeping watch  marisha ill be right back you guys find a spot ill meet you there i go back and i go  jeremiah give me that i take bread or whatever he has prepared  matt you come to jeremiah you eventually start shouting until you find jeremiah jeremiah is this  mid40s halfling fellow pale but welldressed in colorful silks and vibrant makeup from some of  the theater productions youve seen he /none/ seems almost made up for the stage but just a cook big  smile big curled waxed mustache hair parted and curled on the sides light brown auburn hair  portly halfling fellow and as youre shouting his name he goes hello are you looking for me  marisha yep jeremiah  matt im jeremiah whats your name  marisha hi beau  matt beau yes youre one of the new kids i am making food would you  marisha what do you have right now something ready i want to chew on something while we talk  matt fine /none/ here you go he hands over a somewhat stale loaf  marisha thank you you have sausage to go with that  matt no they are being prepared and i wish not to serve something that is unfinished  marisha water wine  matt sighs grabs a thing of wine a small jar and says you can fetch your own water  marisha thank you sorry im just hungry as fuck i go back to the group  matt all right you guys patiently wait for beau to return with a stale  marisha i got appetizers there you go /none/  sam okay thats good gnawing  travis i should start by thanking all of you for putting yourselves in harms way again i did not  expect that to go the way that it did but that seems a repetitive notion at this point  marisha what the fuck actually happened down there we havent really gotten a clear  description and were all confused  travis yeah i knew when she showed that exuberance at diving down that it was a matter of  urgency and i just couldnt catch her we made our way down this well /none/ into this open spherical  room at the bottom underneath some algae there was a recession it looked like it had space for  an orb like the eye thats in my sword in my dullardly moment of trying to figure how the fuck  i would get it in there she reached out and she has the same sort of thing in her hand she put it  in before i could put the sword in it ripped the eye straight out of her hand pulled her hand back  and blood was coming out of it i thought /none/ it had done something to her thats when i saw these  arcanelike symbols light up and they shoot across the floor and straight up toward you guys right  above the water  marisha yeah we saw them  travis you saw them come out what happened  marisha it connected to the pillars and then thats when everything started flooding then it  was just running for our lives at that point i dont know i didnt see much else  liam it was in a hurry but the type of runes that were in that chamber were /none/ one of protection  some sort of ward that i dont understand its old it shook the entire room we were in i  thought maybe there were three locks down there but you only saw one presumably there are two  more places in the ocean or in the world for you  travis that seems like a lot  taliesin theres more than one there was more than one creature  marisha theres also the temple where we found this thing that had the snake the naga  travis but no recession i cant remember when we found /none/ the actual cats eye the sphere it  wasnt in a recession was it just resting at the bottom of the well  matt it was just sitting in a pool of water and you found that amongst other piles it seemed to  be less of a temple and more of a scavenged artifact amongst a merrow den that was expanding  beneath the swamp  taliesin we need three onyx eyes three ivory eyes three amber eyes  travis from three different creatures  marisha what was the one that was inside of you is it the onyx /none/ one  travis no it was the amber one  marisha it was the amber one oh shit  travis yeah that big serpent with all the eyes like in her captains  sam what was avantikas  travis amber yeah  marisha is it the same color  travis yeah i mean theyre yellowishamber yellowishorange just depends on the way the  light hits it  marisha so in the amber it was the giant serpent with the tidal wave  travis yeah the same that she had decorated around her office thats ukotoa you saw when we  /none/ were in the boat she closed her hands and you felt that surge in the water  liam yeah  travis yeah i think because she got there first and offered her orb she was rewarded with some  sort of oceanic control or power over water  sam she controlled the water  travis i think so  sam shes the one who made the flood  travis no back when we were in the rowboats  sam oh when we took off i was curled up in the bottom of the well of the rowboat cowering so i /none/  didnt see any of that she got something for giving up her  travis i think so yeah i dont know why the water surged out of the temple like that  sam we also heard a large cracking sound as if a lock had been broken or a wall had been broken  travis you said they were protective in nature  liam yeah  marisha so three murals three creatures beings three chosen ones and three different  eyes in each  taliesin a creature of the sea a creature of the air with fire  marisha /none/ and taliesin and a creature of the earth  marisha do i remember anything from hitting the books in school of some gods  matt roll a history check  marisha it would be history and not religion  matt this would be history technically actually history or religion  marisha well theyre the same for me same modifier 17 herstory  matt you recall tales i mean there are many powerful creatures that have existed throughout  history entities that are either elemental in nature or are primal forces of power there are  some that are guardians of /none/ the world some that are guardians of the elements within their own  planes there are many types of horrors and protectors throughout history thinking back to  some of your studies both historically and in cracking the tome of the occasional religious  thing against your better will in your classes there are some entities that were left in the wake  of the divergence avatarlike entities or at least creations that were meant to be an extension  of the power of the gods some of them are guardians in the world some of them still remain  /none/ true to the religions or the gods that created them some over time have found their own  interests some have grown obsessed with their own power without their creator and master to chastise  or watch over them and see themselves as a new god even thinking back you dont have all the  information but you do know that thinking back to the murals and things youve heard about  ukotoa being said ukotoa was worshipped by the kinau which were the indigenous people of the  menagerie coast and the swavain islands in the vicinity ukotoa was /none/ one of these avatar entities  that was created by zehir the cloaked serpent to be one of its many ambassadors of power and one of  its greatest warriors in the conflict of the calamity  marisha big kaijuskind of thing  matt essentially when zehir and the rest of the betrayer gods were banished along with the other  prime deities they were now the most powerful beings on the surface of exandria as such new  religions began to spring up around them the kinau of this area took to worshipping ukotoa  and ukotoa began to /none/ preside like the next best god there was you get the sense that these other  two entities might be similar relics of this time powerful beings created before or during the  calamity and then left with their gods now sealed away to become forces of power of their own you  dont know if theyve been sealed in the same fate that ukotoa was but based on what you saw in  that temple they seem to be connected or at least have similar structure of worship  travis this is some heavy shit  marisha i say /none/ all of that i read this one paragraph once and then the filigree there was a  monk with a trumpet up his ass and thats why i remembered this section so well in fact still  remember the book bet if we go back to the library we could still find it and we could  figure out more about this  matt if you were to find a place of deep research you could probably find more information  about these entities yes  travis that would be a choice  marisha speaking of choice whats yours  /none/ liam yeah she said for all of us to hear that the real reward comes from releasing the serpent  is that your intentions is that what you desire  travis no  marisha it feels like she has bigger plans  travis im not a crazy person all right a giant serpent from the calamity  marisha the divergence yeah  travis yeah thats some medieval shit that is bigger than anything ive ever heard of  liam so what are we doing  sam are we pirates now is that the thing because i dont like the water /none/ at all i dont  want to be on a boat anymore  travis i know and caduceus i know your experiences with water have been less than thrilling  marisha ive actually had a good time ive died a few times but im great  taliesin i think the question really is what were going to have to do about this i mean this  is the direction that were heading this is whats being put in front of us i dont know if  running headlong into the next temple is the best option i think maybe if /none/ you didnt find the  answers you were looking for down in the water maybe its time to look somewhere else  sam if i might fjord i dont know much about how this magic works but if theres three of  these things right at least three of these eyes that need to be placed to unlock three temples of  whatever and release the crazy thing under the ocean one has been activated one is inside you  theres one maybe we should try to find that one with that one we could then safely get the  /none/ one out of you because we would have the third one and we could go break it somewhere and then wed  know that no one could unlock it ever  travis im all for trying to get knowledge out of the captain she seemed to act like she knew who  the third person was or had been  marisha she also seems very interested in you and dont get me wrong shes hot and all but i  question her motives feels like shes i dont know  liam she looks at him like a skeleton key she /none/ needs him for what she wants  marisha i agree with that and i think shes understood that her sexuality can be wielded as a weapon  travis i see that as well thank you for the lookout frankly between us i actually tried to  keep her underwater after she got away real fast  marisha oh thats fucking brutal  travis yeah and then i had to act like no look at the ground it was terrible fucking failed  taliesin all things considered i think it would be best if we left on good terms  travis /none/ i agree id like to find out what she knows about the third and then maybe ask for a  bit of respite before we continue i actually do not feel very comfortable  taliesin lets get to port and restock and thats when well figure out  liam i doubt she would allow us to leave on any terms  taliesin i dont know  liam she needs whats in him  sam what if we surprise her tie her up then jester can do her zone of truth thing we can find  out everything she knows slit /none/ her throat and sink her ship  travis see i would be all for that given the circumstances of what beau just outlined big  consequences looming that are ageold timeless things but if she can control water now i would  be concerned that that effort might fall short and then wed be super fucked i dont know what  her abilities are  taliesin perhaps some sign of agreement to share information with the understanding that youre  both working towards the same goals and maybe it would be better to have two groups doing this  instead /none/ of one  travis yes i need more info caleb i need more data more knowledge you read books on this  stuff there has to be someone out there that knows more about this before we just charge in  taliesin shes already said that shes sent people out to do this work it wouldnt be that  much different i suppose  travis if we have what she needs shell have to play nice  sam what if we just leave her she could go off and do god knows what  taliesin as opposed to what  /none/ sam he can stay with her we can stop it before she does it  travis i think shes only interested in the one creature so shes only interested in this type of  eye i dont even want to start to think about the onyx eyes or the ivory eyes  liam if we want to leave we are not going to walk away were going to sneak away shes not  going to let go of you you are a key that she needs she said herself that greater things come  when the serpent is released the /none/ giant godlike serpent i would ask you were all here we like  you and if you are being completely forthright with us were good but if we get the slightest  whiff that you are after what this woman is after well i cant speak for them im not  interested in being here anymore  matt yasha puts her hand on your shoulder and says faith is a funny thing be careful where  you place it it can give strength or it can lead to terrible things  travis thank you yasha i understand your concern caleb /none/ i do i have a small curiosity  from the things that ive seen i have no interest in dealing with matters that predate time as we  know it im pretty simple these days ive spent with you are the most exciting of my entire life  im not looking to end them or the world by frivolously giving up something that i barely  understand id like to try to ask if we can go separate ways and if she says no i would play  that we would join her and her voyages in the morning and /none/ then sneak away id like to try and  do it amicably if we can  marisha i dont think theres anything wrong with maybe asking for the mist i think maybe caduceus  has a good point if we can convince her that were still part of her crew by doing our own recon  taliesin to be honest it would be worth actually following through with it anyway she knows things  that we dont we get to find out  marisha we took all that time to learn how to sail the damn thing  liam also /none/ that boat is fucked and they could shoot us to bloody hell if they wanted to so it  wont be that big of a stretch if we wanted private sleeping quarters  travis for sure i think either way we have to make it to darktow and we need a second ship  third if she doesnt have a specific location two ships find that thing faster than one  marisha mmhmm  taliesin thats true  travis what do you say well have to play along until we get to darktow and it is not somewhere  that /town/ you normally want to go if youre not of the pirate variety  liam none of us have any chance any other option but to play along  taliesin is this some sort of pirate town  travis i think its a pirate island its a hideaway you dont go there unless youre looking  for trouble or unless you are the trouble  marisha hee thats awesome speaking of trouble are you going to take her up on that glass of wine  travis shit  marisha that she has mentioned three times  travis yeah yeah yeah  /none/ liam whats jester doing right now  matt fuming  sam shes just touching her lips  taliesin jesters carving something into the bow of the boat and we dont know what shes got the  axe and shes moving it in a direction without looking  travis i suppose i should to keep relations up  liam yeah well you do what you have to  travis yes all right ill see you all underneath  sam wait take this vial of acid just in case i dont know maybe shell try something and you  just splash it /none/ in her face i dont know  travis in her face  sam i dont know  travis i think it just burns  sam sure whatever  travis is it magic acid  sam nope just acid  travis okay did you make this  sam i did  travis thank you  taliesin are we now going to go and sleep and properly sleep  sam no not until he comes back from his rendezvous  taliesin i think im going to go to sleep i dont know about the rest of you im going to pat  /none/ him on the shoulder and just for fun cast protection from poison  travis ooh  taliesin youve got an hour  travis okay all right thank you caduceus im going to make you a fan of water before your life  is done i swear  taliesin i dont mind it i think i just have an issue with the things that are in it and being  under it and im going to go to sleep and probably yeah throw up a little  sam i dont like it at all  travis youre going to be my /none/ strongest acolyte youre going to preach the words of the water  sam its terrible  travis its really not i mean look how good youre doing right thriving surviving  sam this was the worst day of my life  taliesin i cant leave yet  travis your whole life  sam i mean as far as i can remember this was a really bad day and water had a lot to do with it  laughter  travis yeah okay ill get back to you on that  sam sure  travis ill make my way towards the /none/ captains quarters  taliesin were going to figure out a way for you to breath underwater its going to be okay  sam oh i dont care about being underwater i just dont like looking at it  taliesin come on  matt so you guys all go to rest  liam yeah im exhausted  matt all right you guys go to rest  taliesin a long rest  matt you head your way to the captains quarters  travis i do  matt all right you head to the door its closed knocking for a moment you hear /none/ this  sound of rushing water  liam shes cleaning up  travis ill try the door  matt okay it opens up its the normal office den set up but theres the balcony out back that  opens up and there on the balcony avantika is standing on the balcony and theres this column of  water that is rising up out of the ocean shes nude its washing her shes in the process in  the throes of manipulating this water shes learning whatever this new gifted power that she  has her hair is twirling up into /none/ the stream and its this beautiful almostdance between her and  this elemental force that she now has she looks back over her shoulder at you knowing that youve  been there for at least a couple minutes ill be just a moment  travis dont rush on my account  matt eventually the water splashes down and off the side she walks back out of the night air and  pulls her hair up and ties it off  liam ive seen this film  matt she takes a little silk robe and places it over her and sits /none/ down there are already two  glasses places on the table she uncorks it and pours two glasses  travis to your success  matt to our success in time eh  travis one can hope its only fair youve been on this journey far longer than i have  matt this is true not the best wine youve had but its serviceable  travis not aerated  matt i am excited for you to experience this  travis i am as well is it everything you thought it would be  matt ive only but scratched the surface and /none/ ive never felt a connection like this with the  sea that has been my life its incredible i can only do it in bursts but i can cause it to swell  and move and part and flood and shift its sighs soon she reaches out and touches the  top of your hand soon i promise now we were talking before and i think its only fair she  takes another big sip your blade is very interesting i knew one other who had a blade very  similar referred to it as the sword of fathoms  /none/ travis sword of fathoms  matt the previous chosen  travis can you tell me more about this person who wielded it  matt his name was vandren  marisha whispering fuck  matt a fine sailor and a foolish coward he ended up to be but he was the one that opened my eyes  to the destiny of ukotoa we traveled together for a number of years before he just abandoned and  absconded with something important ive been trying to find out where he went but he is very  slippery wherever he is either what you /none/ have in your sword is what he took away or wherever he is  he has the third with him  travis this vandren you say he told you about the sword of fathoms or he had a sword of fathoms  matt he carried the same blade  travis the same one was there an area a destination a direction that you last knew that  he was going is it in our interest to try and find him  matt it is very much in our interests we were going to go and visit this very island some /none/ time  ago when he was the only one to have one of these orbs  travis how did you find if you dont mind me asking yours  matt well i had to kill a number of men it was being auctioned off in port damali and there  was a collector word had gotten to us that this artifact was sold off to this individual well  needless to say he put up a bit of a struggle  travis im sure he did  matt thankfully this collector enjoyed nights long at sea and that happens to /none/ be our specialty  his corpse now adorns one of the many beautiful islands and now i have this beautiful reminder  the hand you can see its now mostly healed over but there is a scar where this orb once  resided in her palm  travis ill stand and just pace around the quarters looking at the various iconography of  the serpent  matt as youre pacing she talks towards you its very interesting that you carry the same  blade as vandren did and come to me with what could very well be the same orb /none/ do you know this  one this vandren  travis i dont we should find him  matt make a deception check  travis nervous laughter 23  sam contested  no audio  matt hmm  travis long sigh this sword came to me in a very unusual way ive been a sailor for many years myself and  was lost at sea during a storm when i woke up i found myself on the shore and there in the waves  next to me was this sword i dont know how i got there but as soon as /none/ i grasped it it changed  everything the sword however did not have the eye the eye we found later my companions and me  matt who else was on this ship with you  travis various other sailors our captain  matt who was your captain  travis captain twitchwood do you know him  matt she smiles i appreciate that you are a very accomplished liar but so am i the only  reason why i still sit here before you with the dozen or so scars i carry is because i have been  very keen at /none/ seeing through the same skill  travis highpitched a 23 level skill okay  liam his name is captain wiggledick  travis then im sure you can understand the need for secrecy for a small circle  matt you know vandren dont you  travis i do  matt and he was on this ship that you shipwrecked on eh do you remember where this  storm was  travis i remember where we found the stone  matt do you remember where the storm was  travis the storm  matt that sunk the ship you were on  /none/ travis yes  matt this was the last time you saw vandren  travis i feel like you know the rest of this story and i am at a disadvantage  matt i dont necessarily i have not seen vandren since he absconded with this many  things but he will not travel with both that sword you carry and the orb he stole from us so  wherever that ship has sunken theres a very good chance that it has the third missing orb do you  remember where the ship sunk  travis sighing  matt she reaches /none/ out and pulls out a map and rolls it out on the table in before you put your  map up  travis yeah yeah yeah  sam just splash acid all over it  laughter  sam youve got this  background music rustling  travis now between you and i  matt yes  travis there was a storm do i remember  matt you do recall actually it was somewhere coming back along this trade route and somewhere  in this space the storm had blown through this is where it sank and you washed up  /none/ travis darktows over here right  matt darktows over here you washed up on this island here  travis were over here  matt you guys are over there at urukaxl you washed up over here so the storm was in this vicinity  travis okay okay okay yep fuck it  yes i do remember where the ship sank  matt then my friend i think we are going to do even more amazing things together  travis i agree i believe that will have to wait until we find ourselves on darktow though  matt i have been /none/ patient this long i can be patient a bit further very well she leans  forward with the wine glass very close and goes its been a very long day i think rest is in order  travis laughter i would agree  matt she takes a big long drink of wine sets it down well there are ways to complete a hopeful  future pact together many different ways  laughter  sam whispering yes yes yes  liam fade to tentacles  travis stuttering yeah im going to go for it im going for it i will noises /none/ of distress  oh god okay yep yep yep i will keep avantikas hand and walk around the desk and i  will try the old leanin and see what the reaction is  matt man all right  sam oh man im getting some twitchwood right now  laughter  matt quickly her hand grabs the back of your head and pulls you in  taliesin im very mixed about this whole thing  travis yeah  matt shes a very powerful woman and you find yourself very quickly overpowered you are allowed to  laughter  matt for /dung/ the sake of brevity not the most restful evening youve had but an evening is had  liam how many points of exhaustion  marisha make a constitution check  matt no im never going to do that in a game sure go for it then thats your own  travis 16  marisha eyy  matt in despair no no  liam you succeed the check but you disappoint your dungeon master  matt i wouldnt call it a romantic evening but a very  travis an adrenaline  matt union of two business partners of a similar goal /none/  sam the sound of fish slapping against each other  laughter  sam theyre both of the sea  liam right in the blowhole  matt and we fade to black  travis do i make my way back to quarters before sunup i dont know if i want to stay the entire  evening there  matt you do fall asleep together  travis oh okay  matt unless you choose to not wish to  travis no im not going to stay you dont walk out of the captains quarters at sunup plus im  super tired /none/ i will leave and try to stealth back to the quarters of everyone else  taliesin i have a passive perception of 18  matt i know  travis hopefully youre super asleep  matt roll a stealth check  travis come on copper dice gods 18  matt all right you carefully and quietly tiptoe your way through the hallway to your assigned  quarters of which you are sharing with whom  travis and matt caduceus  matt one eye slowly opens as you are keen to be somewhat aware living alone out in the  dangerous wood /none/ to any sort of aberrant noise in the vicinity you hear the faint creak of very  gentle footsteps as fjord makes his way into your chambers  taliesin can i figure out what happened just by looking at him  matt you yeah  giggling  taliesin sleep well with your bad decisions  matt as you all rest a long rest at sea as the squalleater and the mistake make their way towards  darktow to the far west well end tonights game there and pick up there next week  marisha aw no what  matt also /none/ everyone levels up everyones level seven now  exclamations  marisha cheers  liam aw thats a great ending thats a good finish  matt to that degree while i have you guys here lets roll some hit points for those who are present  sam do we recover our exhaustion  matt over the next couple of days you will because this is a multiday travel to get to  darktow so your points of exhaustion will be gone by the time it matters  travis ill let yasha roll for hers  sam i should probably roll for /none/ laura what do you think you think shell appreciate that  matt its

a one thats how i do it  taliesin what do i get at level seven  matt /none/ all right guys were not going to sit here and subject you guys to us leveling up at the  table although im sure there are a few that would love to see it we got the important part  out for you guys well pick up here next week to see whats in store for the company of the  squalleater of which the mighty nein have joined the union of partnership of captain avantika and  fjord and the imminent darktow in your future  liam seamen seamen everywhere  sam and taliesin and not a drop to /none/ drink  background chatter  matt
