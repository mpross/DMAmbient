none	 we  saw them the group of adventurers vox machina had found themselves in the feywild intent on  discovering another one of the vestiges of divergence one of the many artifacts that they  hope will aid them in their struggle against thordak the cinder king and the rest of the  chroma conclave defeating two of the members three still remain thordak being the seeming  powerhouse head of that troop  so now deep in the feywild a crazy alternate dimension in which fey creatures rule a landscape  where up is down and everything is topsyturvy 
none	 and nothing is what it seems theyve made their way  through the moonbrush parlayed with a group of lycanthropes werewolves werebears weretigers  and a group of pixies and made a choice the pixies now scattered and stapled to a number of  trees in the forest  the leader of their troop an extremely large powerful werewolf lord named ukurat has pledged  his aid to some degree in the near future should you need it as you travel duskward past the gilded  run eventually to the source of where apparently this bow fenthras exists in the 
dung	 shademirk bog  and now we pick off where we last left off the rest of you after resting in the treetops on the  outskirts of the duskward side of the moonbrush youve come to consciousness gathered your  things escaped the forest and headed northward just beginning to see the cresting edge of the  tangled river mass of the gilded run and beyond that the dark ominous shadow the shademirk bog  so before you guys press anywhere forward  is there any preparation you want to take  on your adventure  laura straightup prep oh 
none	 jeez  matt youre about to travel forward  what do you want to do  sam can you hear us yes  are there any potion stores nearby  laughter  matt roll an investigation check no  sam ooh 22  matt oh you strongly recall information that inform you that the last bastion of true  civilization is long past you south of where you originally came from  sam well then i will take a moment  to limber up for the day stretch up  yeah just stretch up active squats  travis can i 
none	 ask a question since i was obviously out of commission with the whole last  fight that happened  laura your own fault grog  travis its not i was being a politician is anybody hurt do we need to heal anybody  before we go did these fireflies mess  with any of you  taliesin i think everyones mostly fine  marisha i think you were the only one who got the shitty end of that deal  travis thats fucked up  sam i will say that vax looks a little weird  laura vax is just 
none	 strange  matt vax turns to you and goes yeah i usually feel a bit that way quiet as you guys are  preparing for the morning theres a strange sound like a simmering highpitched whine two or three  times you see these sudden bright flashes of light in your vicinity and theres a burst of  white light as out stepping from it you see the somewhatcorporeal divine energybased form  of pike trickfoot  cheering  laura oh my god  ashley im back  sam no you are not supposed to trust anything  in the 
none	 feywild  laughter  ashley i swear its me  sam theres only one way to find out  i run up and i kiss her  laughter  ashley that was a little fast i think  sam its her  matt garmelie at this point watching this whole circumstance walks up to you and goes  its good to see you again i dont know  where you went away last time but i hope  you enjoyed the last sketch i did if you need  any more let me know i got plenty of paper  
dung	 ashley okay what was that who were you  matt you look down and see the small faun who you previously had commissioned to draw  ashley yes i really love that piece that you did  matt well thank you kindly  ashley youre so welcome  matt let me know your forms closer to mine  so its easy for me to get a full view  laughter  travis whoa  laughter  ashley thats okay  travis snap so are we going  across the river then  marisha wait theres a river  matt make 
none	 a perception check  laughter  marisha really okay  matt first roll of the night  travis ten  marisha its okay 18  matt 18 okay glancing ahead of you you see the hint of the peak of an ominous mountain range  slowly growing in the distance at the base of that you see a treacherous weave of powerful  rivers rushing past and around the exterior of the shademirk bog these large heavy trenches of  water jamming and folding into each other youve heard of the gilded run and youve seen a few  stationary 
dung	 rivers in the past but this is a cluster of perpetually rushing rapids that fill a  rather sizeable period of the land surrounding the actual shademirk bog and you can see just past  it the edge of the bog itself these very dark glistening almost black oilcaked tree canopies  that vanish into shadow beneath  but thats a couple of miles off  travis but the rapids are right there  matt you can see them maybe half a mile in front of you and you can see the spray occasionally  shooting off some of the 
none	 rocks and the shore of the river just barely shows  the speed of the water passing by  laura its definitely not something we can wade across im assuming  sam we could fashion a crude canoe  and go down it  marisha or i could part the sea  im going to take my staff  and i want to feel how deep it is  matt okay so you decide to walk the halfmile  to make it to the river  marisha i thought we were there  its a lot going on  sam 
none	 lets walk the halfmile its a halfmile  marisha and it looks like a long river  matt its a series of long rivers that completely wrap around the shademirk one side of it seems to  be vanishing into the green sea which you could barely see to the far seaward side of you and it  curves around the outside of the shademirk and vanishes into the horizon  sam its a river  laura its a big river  taliesin it looks like a river at the very least dont trust anything in the feywild  laura 
none	 can i perception and see if there are any sort of creatures that are visible  matt do you want to get close to it first you have a jaunty jog on your way towards the gilded  run a very short time passes before you begin to actually hear the waters in the distance and as  you begin to approach about a hundred feet from the edge of the first stripe of river and you can  see some are tighter together some are only a few feet between the rivers some merge into even  thicker roaring 
none	 rapids theyre all traveling from the seaward side to the tangleward side  in laymans terms west to east  taliesin how far in does it take to cross all of these little rivers  matt the rivers change in width the smallest one you can see is maybe ten feet across some of them  swell to upwards of 30 40 feet depending at which point you come across it  taliesin whats the speed and roughness  of the tenfoot  matt theyre all pretty matching in speed and theyre pretty hefty you can see there are  
none	 occasional rocks in the edges of water that are just spraying causing the water to smash into the  side and split off around it theres nothing visible in the water drifting through most of it  is destroyed in the process of crashing against the rocks in the sides of the bank  taliesin lets find a nice mix of nottoowide and nottoorapidy not too fast  sam and do what  taliesin and start thinking of a way across it and making sure that its not magical or strange  ashley could we fly  laura i can 
none	  ashley you can  laura brother do you want to scout up ahead maybe fly up above the river and see down into  the oily land both of us  matt fine ill go ahead and give it a look i suppose although you can fly any time you want  if you wish  laura yes i can and i do i pick my broom up  matt he seemingly ducks down into the grasses that you guys are standing in and vanishes barely  giving a small path as he disappears  laura i float above 
none	 him on the broom  matt occasionally you see him glance up and loudly grumble  laura you are so hidden right now i can barely even see you so hidden  matt i appreciate the backup sister and he keeps continuing forward as you get to the edge  of the water itself he looks inside its pretty clear the water as you can see the bottom of it  right there you can see a deepset blanket of greenishbrown algaetype plant life that cakes  the bottom of the river floor the occasional stone protruding from it and 
none	 everything is growing  and pushed around it he releases his raven wings from his armor which shoot out in a large 15foot  wingspan on each side he jumps in the air makes his way over the first short river  and lands on the other side  laura oh okay i fly up and i stay above him  i dont want to land on the ground  matt okay glance over his wings fold behind him and hes like was it so hard sister really  laura you wasted your entire hour of flying  for that 
none	  laughter and applause  matt sighs  laura oh i got a vax sigh i like it  matt he scoots underneath your broom as youre hovering on and one of his wings catches the edge  of it flicks and then tries to knock you off your broom make a quick strength check  laura a what check  matt strength my dear  laura oh i got a natural one  laughter  laura if you just killed me  matt as the edge of his wings smack the back side of the broom it spins out 
none	 from under you and for  a moment you grasp the edge of the front of the broom and it slips from your fingers you flick  off tumble to ground about ten feet not too far you take one point of damage from the impact  nothing huge but as you roll to the side your broom scatters across the stones and dips  partially into the river which begins  carrying it slowly  laura no and i crawl over and grab it  matt okay you grab it and pull it out as you turn back over 
none	 your brothers sitting there with  his arms crossed his wings still folded smiling  laura i swing around and hit him with the broom  matt make an attack roll  this is not with your bow by the way this is just adding your proficiency bonus youre not  even proficient this is an improvised weapon so you have disadvantage go ahead and roll again  laura disadvantage aw come on  that was so much better than the first one  matt youre not proficient really in attacking with brooms  laura 13  matt 13 with 
none	 but an instant of reaction time it passes a good solid foot and a half in front of  his face his wings furl a couple of feathers dangle down and he turns around and decides to  hop over the next bit of the river  laura i hate you sometimes  matt i know sister as he takes off  laura all right i get on my broom and fly after him like a loser  matt any of you guys also doing anything or are you just watching them scouting ahead  travis were just watching them 
none	 fly around  matt as you scoot up to catch up to your brother hes probably a good 15 feet ahead of you  laura yay were back  ashley that was such a busy desktop  matt as you hop up after him you notice his wings go into a dive and he ends up curving  downward at an alarming rate  diving right into the river  laura can i float down and try to grab him  matt i need you to make a wisdom saving throw  laura a wisdom saving throw  shit balls 
none	 mother thats bad nine  matt as soon as you see your brother dive into the water you begin to coast downward as you do  theres an impulse in your head that begins pushing and steering the broom lower lower and  even in the back of your head you sense this is bad were going far too steep its like youre  outside of your physical body the control has alleviated itself and your body forces you to  splash into the river as well both of you guys submerging yourself in the raging rapids you guys  
none	 see this in the distance with a splash of two impacts on the riverside  travis did we tell them to go fishing  marisha i dont think we did  laura can we try to get out can we try to get out of the water  marisha okay lets go save our friends  matt there is a tenfoot river for you guys to traverse first before you get to them each of  you who are trying to leap across make an athletics check  marisha i didnt say i was trying to leap across  matt 
none	 i said anyone who wants to try  travis you want to hop on the  laughter  sam i dont follow ill jump on all right grogs got two gnomes on his back  matt grogs got two gnomes on his back  of course he does thats perfect  laura help right here are we underwater or are we on top of the water were just dying  matt two gnomes on grogs back you grab both of them do a quick sprint and leap as heavy as you  can go ahead and make an athletics check 
none	  travis i rolled a 25  laura oh thats good thats way better  matt much like how hulk escapes a fray you watch as grog bounds into the air in a large arc  slamming into the other side causing the stones on the outskirts of the riverbed to crack beneath  him you stand back up proud of yourself  pike and scanlan youre a little jostled  from the impact  ashley that was so fun  travis i know right  sam i think i landed on my keys  taliesin and i rolled a 
none	 nine  matt you smile as you hear a splash behind you percival getting right up to the edge and leaping  as his foot catches the stone and goes right into the smaller rapid being carried as well  keyleth  marisha the people who are in the water  are they being dragged under  we can just not see them anymore  matt if you take a moment to watch  marisha yeah percy percy  taliesin i think im fine im just wet  sam is he being carried away  matt the three whove been 
none	 pulled under the river that includes you vexahlia vaxildan  and percy i need you to make  a constitution check  laura constitution  marisha why does everything here hate us  laura ugh oh jesus six  travis youre going to die live  taliesin ten  laura why am i rolling so bad right now  matt 14 okay you manage to pull yourself up to the surface and you almost get to the point of  actually getting some air and a force pulls you back under  marisha percy aw  laughter  matt however 
none	 percy you do maintain the breath in your lungs you and your brother both  coughs give away a bulk of the air and you feel yourself in the beginning spasms of drowning  laura can i cast grasping vine from the side of the river and try to catch myself  matt you know what yes you can in the aspects of this sequence though it is a difficult job to  cast this is it a concentration check or not  laura i dont know  marisha grasping vine is a bonus action yo  matt but is 
none	 it a concentration spell  that is the difference  laura i dont have my card because were traveling  sam matt how far are they from me  matt from you guys out there theyre maybe 25 feet from you  marisha wait no it is sorry  matt thats all right so i need you to roll another constitution check if you could  travis roll better  laura im scared of all my dice  travis its because you have a hundred of them  laura no thats good 19  matt okay so yes as the 
none	 rapids are rushing by you open your eyes and the sting of the very  highpowered water hitting your eyeballs causes you to have a hard time even seeing whats up and  down as you glance up to where the little bit of light from the everdusk sky of the feywild pulls  your attention you put your hand out and using that burst of ranger magical energy you watch as  the undergrowth of the river itself stretch out and form this strange slimy mass of vine that  wraps around you and yanks you out of the 
none	 water surface slamming onto the ground  just outside of the river  applause  laura thats my broom that im holding up in my hand right now  marisha so the river doesnt hate magic  laura i dont know  marisha all right  laura wheres my brother wheres vax  marisha im going to cast control water where do i see percy is percy and vax together  matt no vax is in the next river over percy is about maybe 20 feet from you but is quickly being  rushed down the river  marisha vax 
none	 is or percy  matt percy  marisha okay so first im going to control water im going to stop the flow of current  and see if i can get it to burp out percy  matt okay just pat it  marisha im going to burp the river  matt shushing its okay gilded run its okay all right perfect so you see this influx and see  vex get thrown out of the river you see percys hand get pulled back under as the river pulls him  along at a very fast speed you concentrate and 
none	 as you put your fingers forward you see the rapid  river begin to slow down at a certain point and its almost like an invisible dam gets held up as  the waters continue to flow out and carry him a little bit further it slowly descends to leave  him on an empty bank of water as the rest of it slowly seeps to a much lower level you catch your  breath percy however i need you to make a wisdom check as this is a very powerful  magicallyenforced river and its currently combating the strength 
none	 of your spell  this is keyleth shes making a wisdom check  marisha no okay yeah wait what  just a straight wisdom  laura oh no  laughter  marisha i just spent a lot of money on these dice today  sam wait hold on ive got this quick everyone whats that over there there  marisha oh a 15  laura was it a one  marisha i rolled a one  travis you did  taliesin wow  matt all right feeling confident in your druidic ways but unfortunately not yet undergone the  formal 
none	 training of the water ashari the actual forceful wave of the river begins to push back  your control over that being and then cascades down picking percy once again back up an  additional 30 feet down the stream you are at the surface at the moment though you are not  considered drowning youre not drowning  your brother not doing so hot  laura can i send the vine to him  matt well before we get to that the three of you guys now get to act  sam im going to step forward  and 
none	 inspire myself  cheering  sam i sing to myself singing scanlan shorthalt im a gnome my name is scanlan  shorthalt im a gnome theres a million chicks  i havent boned but just you wait  all singing just you wait  cheering  matt fine you go and take your inspiration die  sam and then i will cast bigbys hand bigbys hand because were in a symphony hall and im  going to grab vax and toss him out of the river  matt okay taking bigbys hand i need you to make a strength check 
none	 for bigbys hand  if you could  sam what does he get what does bigby get im going its a different guy hes a whole guy  whos not quite as handsome as me  matt add a plus eight to it  sam okay 25  matt 25 you watch as bigbys hand plunges into the river itself vanishes for a few moments and  then like a reverse cannonball out of the water coming curving around and at an incredible speed  looks like its about to spike vax onto the waters edge before slowing down  
none	 and limply dropping him on the edge  of the bank front  sam i give him a little pat on the head  matt which is good because the pat actually forces the water out of his lungs  coughing and panting no flight  marisha grog  travis yeah  marisha grab percy  travis yes me  marisha grab percy  travis i take the alchemy jug and i turn it upside down like diving bell  and i put it over my head  cheering and applause  travis i take the chain of returning and 
none	 i wrap it around my waist and i hand the other end to  pike because shes got the ogre gauntlets and i wade into the river to go get percy  cheering  matt okay ill say it is your turn because he move quite a bit down the river but you have a  pretty high movement rate as a barbarian so you tie the chain around yourself at your full  movement speed and you get to the very edge of the bank and begin to wade in just as you pull the  jar over your 
none	 head and thats going to be the end of your action there pike youre holding him at  the edge i need you to make a strength check  if you could  ashley i got you buddy  travis come on monstah  ashley oh wait hold on where did it go  im sorry i forgot how to play  matt i believe its a plus four  ashley 18  matt 18 without an issue you watch as this giant anchor of a man is being held solid by this  tiny rock of a gnomish cleric 
dung	  ashley yes  cheering  ashley go get him grog  travis muffled okay  matt you watch as her teeth bite down and her tongue sticks out the edge as she digs her feet  into the bottom of the river rock percy you see a dark form in the river as youre rushing past i  need you to make a perception check with disadvantage as youre being drawn underwater  taliesin perception check with disadvantage  matt this is a perception check with disadvantage  taliesin thats not that bad wheres my perception there it is 
dung	 14  matt 14 okay just as you see this strange dark form appear out of the way you instinctively  sweep your hand out and you smack and catch the edge of grogs pants  sam he has pants  laughter  matt at the hip and you catch it grog you see the hand emerge and you catch the edge of it and  pull him up out of the river hes now out caught his breath hes no longer beneath the surface  you guys are still being pulled now by the water your feet are beginning 
none	 to fall out from  under you as the rocks that are holding you up are being pulled along by the force of the river  it seems the longer youre in the river  the stronger its getting  travis oh shit pike pull i got him  matt i need you to roll another strength check pike as you pull them in there is a little more  weight on there so the dcs going to be a little higher go ahead and roll  travis 21  sam can i quickly inspire her  matt if you 
none	 want to yeah  sam yes i turn to her and i sing singing repairing up your heart when she heals you  and when you are a bard you feel it too  and no matter what you do she heals the pain  and shes pretty too  travis i love you for doing nsync  marisha tensider  laura she did a tensider  matt shes taking it now so roll a strength check and add  ashley oh its the same or is that this way  travis thats a nine  laura thats good thats 
none	 better  ashley 15  sam with my dice  ashley yes i originally rolled a two  matt even with the fantastic rhymes of scanlans voice ringing in your ears and youre holding  tight you feel your heels begin to scrape as the river rush is pulling you now towards the river  grog and percy you feel yourselves being brought deeper into the center of the river  marisha can i try again with the current its a concentration spell up to ten minutes  matt yeah you do so coming back to keyleth at this point 
none	  marisha even the waters angry screams  matt keyleth id like you to make another wisdom check if you could  travis roll good  marisha okay thats better straight wisdom a saving throw or just a check  matt just a check  marisha 16  matt 16 thats better as you guys are being swept away you feel the current begin to subside  slowly and pike once again you get your ankles dug in you begin to pull on this and between the  two of you and the concentration of keyleth you manage to wrestle 
none	 grog and percys forms out of  the river onto the bank now you guys are between the two  cheering  sam you guys we defeated a creek  taliesin we didnt actually even defeat it  marisha no we havent even gotten started theres like 50 more creeks in front of us  laura me and vax are on one side and everyone else is on the other then  matt yes there are a couple of small trees that are planted or grown up between the river banks  and you can still hear the rapids rushing 
none	 past  sam how many more rivers would we have to cross  matt looking ahead of you theres probably 12  travis lets just go home fuck it  taliesin that was very clever with the pot  by the way  travis yeah right i figured if anything was going to hit me in the head  it would hit the jug first  taliesin that was less clever but still very impressive what if we were to throw your chain  or if we could throw the rope across the river  laura actually im going to 
none	 use my earring  so i dont have to shout  taliesin yeah no thats better  laura i feel like when i was crossing the river i wanted to kill myself and im afraid that  anybody else crossing the river  taliesin no vax has already crossed were not going to feel the angst coming off of him  matt the experience when you were trying to cross over was reminiscent of that urge to jump  whenever youre near the edge that weird very base impulse whenever you get to a point of danger  that says 
none	 do it its like that being triggered and preyed upon  marisha its a river of impulses such an allegory for so many things  taliesin heres a thought we take the rope we tie ourselves to it we toss it over to the two of  you we start using it to wade you help pull us over everybody would have to be terrible for  everything to go everybody will be fighting together to get across  ashley we can attach the rope to the immovable rod just put it in the ground  laura i think i 
none	 have it i thought grog had it but i think i might have picked it up after  taliesin as long as were tied together we can only go so far itll be like mountain climbing  sam but that just gets us across one right  taliesin i think theyre across two  travis how wides the second river between us and vax  matt it would take you guys about 20 feet across  taliesin thats good 20 feet across  sam no theres ten more rivers  laura theres so many rivers  sam can we become 
none	 mist form are our minds affected when were mist form  taliesin yes im sure  laura is it are we  marisha i didnt learn mist form today  travis fucking hell  ashley what if we made a boat and then floated down the river  travis theyre rapids  ashley that sounds like a terrible idea by the look of his face  marisha does it look like all the rivers are connected  matt it looks like some of them swell between each other and then split off again some are  solitary from your current 
none	 position that you can see but you only have whats immediately near you  to really see since some of these are hills and it carves into part of these hills you dont have  a complete view of how they intertwine and merge beyond the immediate hillsides  laura hey garmelie  sam yeah wheres he  matt hes back on the other side  laura hi  matt some help please  laura have you heard any stories about how people crossed these damn rivers before  matt i told you ive heard about this land  i 
none	 havent actually been here  laura i know so tell me what youve heard  matt its dangerous and it keeps the shademirk from spreading  laura cool  travis garmelie hop in the river  matt no  sam has my minute of hand worn off yet  matt id say its getting towards the end  sam all right im going to take garmelie and throw him across as many rivers as i can  cheering  matt make a strength check  sam 25 again  matt being a small and relatively lightweight fey creature but also 
none	 smug in a standing position  after proclaiming his negative approach to grogs idea he doesnt quite notice the spiraling purple  hand that swings up from behind grasping him and lifting him into the air with an incredible speed  all you hear is the distant squeal as the hand fullon fastball special chucks him  arcing overhead distant scream impact  a little plume of dust  laura did he make it how far did he get  matt he made it past five of them  applause  matt and also suffered 22 points of damage theres 
none	 a long awkward pause  as you see no movement  sam oh god i think i just killed him  laura scanlan youre such a dick  taliesin that was a little harsh  matt which gets more and more awkward the longer it goes by until eventually you see a shift  and this small form rise up raises a thumb  which quickly transitions into a middle finger  cheering  marisha hes fine  sam hes doing great  travis scanlan keyleth if i had magic i would freeze all the water so go ahead and 
none	 do that  marisha if bigbys hand had about ten seconds left ive got about nine minutes left on this  control water spell why dont we try and move as fast as possible along with the chain and maybe  the immovable rod lets go you guys go first and im going to try and halt the flow  matt make a wisdom check if you could  travis come on you stupid opal dice  laura is that a natural 20  marisha no its another fucking one useless  laura put it away keyleth put it away 
none	  for the rest of the night  marisha i spent so much money on these  travis youve got to retire that bitch  matt no they just havent been charged properly cackles  laura put it in its dice jail  taliesin see better  marisha percy dont touch my dice percy  matt so as you guys begin to prepare your attempt to cross the river keyleth concentrates the  river stalls for a moment and then pushes past seemingly unaffected mind you the spell does  seem to have an effect when youre having a better 
none	 time concentrating but it is a magical force  versus a magical force and you can see it actually angrily swells against the resistance  thats where the actual tension comes from there is something living like an entity that these  rivers seem to almost mingle as  travis are there a bunch of trees  matt there are a few sporadic trees scattered around yes  travis how tall are they  matt theyre not that tall some are maybe 15 20 feet up these trees specifically are a little  more marshbased theyre not quite swampbased trees 
none	 but thats as tall as they get  travis and the rivers 20 feet wide right  matt no these are maybe five feet wide  laura oh five feet we could jump across them  matt oh the rivers sorry the trees are five feet wide i misunderstood yes the actual rivers  are between ten to 20 feet  laura do you have tree stride  marisha i do but i can only cast that  on myself  laura i thought we could all use it always  marisha we can use mist form sorry theres teleport 
none	 via plants which i did not bring today  travis what did you bring today  marisha i brought control water grog  sam wait the total distance from us to  the end of the 12th river is how far  matt probably close to 150 feet  taliesin we can do that in five minutes  sam so i can make it with pike super fast  laura how  marisha dimension door  sam yeah but the rest of you are fucked  laura no this is really good this is good because with the immovable rod 
none	  sam i can set it forget it  set it and forget it  laura and then tie maybe the endless rope to it and then you teleport back to the other side  travis hows that going to work  laura i dont know  ashley wait if we dimension door what if you turn into an animal to fly and then you have a  broom and someone can ride on your broom  marisha i could potentially turn us into animals that can swim which is why i was wondering if the  rivers were connected 
none	 maybe we can jump like salmon going upstream  sam dont tell trinket  laura trinket is safe in this necklace  right now  travis can you raise earth can you make a dam  marisha i can and i did bring move earth as well as wall of stone to be totally honest i am  terrified of messing with the ground im afraid if i move the earth it will eat me it will split  open and swallow me i could try it  laura wait did i hear right that these rivers are alive what 
none	 did i hear  marisha theyre magical rivers  travis im going to chop down a tree  laura youre going to chop down a tree  grog keyleth picked a flower  and the entire world ended  travis we are getting nowhere super fast  taliesin easy plan easy peasy  teleport with the immovable rod  you shoot one end of the rope to him  laura oh why didnt i think of that  taliesin everythings easy peasy  marisha why didnt we think of that  sam okay give me the rod you take the 
none	 eternal string or whatever its called  laura i have the eternal string  and i have the rod  travis can i walk over to a tree just in case their plan fails i want to start chopping  matt you go up to one of the nearby trees at the edge and you can see across the way it looks  like theres part of a crumpled stone corner some long dilapidated ruin you can see what looks to  be one dried tree log that has fallen over and rotting on the other side but there is 
none	 one tree  right on the edge of the bank that you guys are on that leads across this next river that is pretty  solid looking maybe four feet in thickness there and 25 feet  laura dont do it grog do not do it yet  travis i hope your stupid plan works  marisha hey grog remember when we almost died because i picked a flower  just throwing it out there  travis im super bored so do your plan  laura im going to start tying the rope  to an arrow  matt youre 
none	 tying the rope to an arrow okay you have at this point a good seven minutes left  marisha of the control water all right  lets do this  laura all right are you going to teleport and then were going to try to do that  sam sure lets do it  laura so you teleport first ill shoot the arrow see if i can actually get it to stick over  there and then you can do the  sam okay pike you with me hand in hand  ashley hand in hand  sam here we 
none	 go i dimension door us across the river if it works  matt okay as you guys grasp hands both of them vanish in a swirl of purplishpink smoke you see  simultaneously across all the banks right at the edge of the shademirk this little burst of  energy you guys land on the ground immediately your feet sinking about three inches into this  black sludgelike tar material already you can smell the outskirts of the shademirk its a very  sulfurous decay smell that permeates the ground by you and you can see it seeping into the 
none	 river  like a slowmoving morass of syrup and the water carries it away upstream like an angry force of  cleaning its a little sludgy where you stand but you guys are across  sam all right hey shoot an arrow at me  laura all right i shoot an arrow not directly at him but pretty close to him  sam thats a long shot  laura i have a really long im just going to shoot a couple arrows just to be sure  sam i instinctively cover my neck  laura 17  matt 17 what 
none	 did you roll  laura a five  matt okay just making sure because ones are always fun for situations like this all right  you fire the arrow it goes a little wide while youre aiming in the proximity of scanlan and arc  off and staples to one of the outside trees sticking in it the rope goes lax and begins to be  carried in the water and you can see the tension as the river itself seems to be trying to pull the  rope underneath the rapids  laura i hold the other side of 
none	 the rope  matt okay you begin pulling it up and its hard to pull up the actual river is almost pulling  the rope under itself  taliesin i grab it too  matt all right i need both of you guys to make strength checks together  marisha can i try and stop the current  once again  matt whats the range on control water  marisha 300 feet  matt yeah you can do that  marisha okay calm waters calm  laura and hook it to the immovable rod there  sam oh yeah i 
none	 forgot that whole part  of the plan  marisha oh my god  taliesin what are you doing  ashley no  laura you cant use it anymore youre not allowed to use that dice anymore  travis just throw it offstage just throw it  marisha i am not giving you all that dice  laughter  travis say it what was it  matt im assuming its a low roll  marisha its a fucking one  for the third time in a row  matt all right so what did you guys roll  for your 
none	 strength checks  laura oh for strength checks i rolled  matt as there has been no druidic aid unfortunately in this particular moment  sam pike do you know any sailors knots  ashley i sure do  sam can you tie a sailor knot around this immovable rod  ashley i sure can  sam which one  ashley the swirleywhirley  laughter  matt as the two of you rush over the 30 feet to the tree that the rope is stapled to right now  its taut and you can see its starting to break the 
none	 arrow as the strength of the rope  being pulled into the river  laura percy what did you roll for strength  taliesin oh thats good i rolled a ten  im not that strong  laura we are so weak  ashley we are doing so great  matt between the two of you guys you manage  to slowly pull it out of most of the rapids  its still being dragged by one it takes you another minute or so but you manage to get the  rope entirely taut against the edge of the arrow 
none	 pike you catch the actual rope on the other side  before the arrow snaps and carries it back by the strength of their pull so you take it and you  make a little knot tie it strong from your experience as a sailor to the immovable rod and  it is solid and in place  taliesin so i tie the rope to myself  laura yeah we should each tie the rope  to all of us  travis what  laura grog youre on the end there  with the rope  travis nope im going 
none	 to cut down this fucking tree  laura no grog  travis all right fine ill help  taliesin were going to tie a rope to you  travis around me  laura around all of us yeah so keyleth too you get a rope as well  you get a rope you get a rope  marisha we all get ropes  taliesin you should be in front and then  the rest of us  laura oh okay sure  sam dont forget vax  laura and vax of course obviously my brother who is standing right here 
none	 very stealthily  matt he looks to you and his wings whoosh  he lets them dissipate as theyre not  going to be much of a help in this moment  if im going to be tied to the rope  i want to be tied close to you at least  he shimmies over  youre all tying yourselves like a daisy chain  laura you know like you do  matt all right once youve all affixed it what is the order in which you guys are affixed  im just curious  travis ill be in 
none	 the front  laura its grog then percy  taliesin vax vex  laura keyleth  sam and then leave a little slack for garmelie  at the end  laura oh right because weve got to pick him up on the way through  matt hes in between the two of you guys  right now hes waiting  laura were on our way to you garmelie  dont worry  matt good he looks over his shoulder at scanlan and goes good all right you guys all  begin to pull yourselves forward on the rope taking your 
none	 time to make sure that if anything bad  happens you take a moment to pause and help out your friends i need everyone whos on the edge  of that rope to make a general athletics check  laura everybody holding on to the rope  matt everybody whos currently tied  onto the rope so not the gnomes  laura athletics  matt yes  travis 20  marisha thats acceptable  taliesin 13  laura are we in any kind of favored terrain right now  taliesin only for aquaman is this favored terrain  matt im 
none	 going to say no  laura okay cool 11 there with the dice and the adding  matt so thats 20 what did you get  marisha 22  matt 22 okay  ashley making a comeback  matt you guys begin to pull yourselves forward the two halfelf twins in their physical  waiflike state begin to find themselves being carried hard down the first second and third  progressive rivers as you guys pull through  but you manage to make up the slack  and get them back on the land each time  it slowed down 
none	 your progress  you only have three more minutes on your spell  marisha keyleths got angry tears of frustration in the back as shes trying to control the water  runny eyeliner like its 2001  matt all right you manage to make it across the next six or so rivers you get to where garmelie  is whos sitting there tapping his little hoof impatiently  laura tie yourself on there garmelie  matt he looks up at the rope which is basically head level give me some slack  laura grunts  matt thanks he wraps it 
none	 around his midsection ties it up and its uncomfortably tight because  as soon as you start moving it pulls on his midsection when its pulled taut because of his  size hes actually lifted up between you guys so his feet dangle and hes topheavy in how it  tied so he rotates his feet are in the air  cheering  matt you bring yourself over to the eighth the ninth river finally traversed a few other scary  moments keyleth i want you to make a wisdom check again to see if you can aid  this 
none	 next length  marisha fuck you no its a 19 total 19  matt harnessing the inspiration of frustration at your recent failures to control the elements that  youve been so hoping to learn to bring to your beck and call you look forward at what would be  the thirdtolast river in your progress forward and angrily do this with your hands you guys  watch as the river like a paper is torn asunder the water held at bay  marisha im sorry  taliesin youre great run  marisha just go  matt you guys run 
none	 down the bank stepping over as you start to reach the other side of the bank  grog your heavy foot hits something that seems to react to the impact of your weight  sam like a thing like a person  matt you guys make your way up the edge of the river as you glance over the side you see  something in the mud vanish beneath  travis i stepped on a catfish  ashley lets eat it  laura get up and out up and out  matt as you guys all get across the water 
none	 slams back continuing to flow with the river angrily  it roars and seems to almost swell up over the bank where it once was before it slowly descends  back to its natural rushing rapids  marisha thats a really big catfish  matt there are two more rivers now ahead of you theres one right before you and then the one  that separates you from scanlan and pike  sam are they multiplying  oh no its because we got them wet  matt there were roughly 12 ahead of you when you asked you guys have 
none	 now traversed nine of them  ten of them so theres only two left at this point keyleth  taliesin i believe in you  marisha i didnt mean to do that i was really nervous but its an 18 so 25 you know what  percy so im going to talk im going to be like look river im your friend i dont want any  tension between us im just trying to make it across you you know  matt the actual neargrowl of the rapids begins to slowly subside in the river before you as the  
none	 water sinks down into a slower more gentle pace you can see it building up and backing up behind  you as the river here comes to a soft cool dip that you guys can begin to walk through as well  marisha good river good boy  travis can i keep an eye out for whatever i stepped on in the river  matt yeah make a perception check  travis six  matt grog being in the front of the troupe as the river is slowly separated for this you step  down into the mud and you 
none	 dont notice a similar shift curl up behind you as suddenly a rapid  whoosh a set of gargantuan long toothfilled jaws come pouring out of the mud underneath the  bank snapping towards your large halfgiant form evil chuckle it has begun that is a 22 to hit  i believe that hits your armor class  travis thatll hit  matt all righty getting ready for the first real attack damage of tonights episode  laura how come we never noticed the battle map has a river on it oh no  matt you suffer 27 points of 
dung	 piercing damage  groaning laughter  matt you grog are suddenly grappled the jaws have latched onto your midsection and hold you  you guys look ahead as you see this form this spray of dark grimy mud and riverbottom muck gets  flung into the air you see what looks to be a far larger than youve ever seen before crocodilelike  entity has come bursting out from under the river you see the sheer force of the impact pushes him  forward and carries him onto the other side of the river in doing so dragging all of 
none	 you behind him  at a rapid pace  travis were across  matt most of you go flying in an arc at the sheer force of this impact i need you guys to make  acrobatics checks to try to stop yourselves  travis its not a catfish  marisha acrobatics or athletics  matt acrobatics  taliesin thats my jam 27  marisha 15  laura 28  travis 21  matt all right and your brother does well of course he does you guys all manage to catch  yourselves right now still attached by the rope 
none	 as you now see this heaping 15 to 20footlong  giant barrel of muscle green scaled skin but what looks to be hundreds of tiny roots that  spread from the center of its midsection reaching into the ground as it begins to move forward  its actually rooting and uprooting itself as it moves you can see the moisture and the life force  of the land is pulsing into its form  as it holds grog in its jaws  i need you all to roll initiative  cheering  sam wait where are we  where are 
none	 the gnomes  matt you guys are way over here on the edge  laura oh no wait where are we  i dont see us at all  sam oh no we have to go back  taliesin to the future  matt please remind me the marching order again if i recall it was grog  taliesin me  matt grog percy thank you  travis garmelie was in the middle somewhere  laura i think he was between me and vax  matt garmelie was between the two of you guys yeah  taliesin it was vax 
none	 garmelie vex keyleth  matt perfect  taliesin dont say that thats not cool  matt you get to see a little behind the field there  taliesin i havent seen that river in two years its so nice  sam pikey pants what should we do  we should go help them right  ashley i dont know  sam i mean this mud is nice  ashley but i did roll shit initiative as usual  matt there he is theres garmelie great  taliesin that was terrible initiative  i am embarrassed by my initiative  laura 
none	 my initiative is really bad as well  sam this is crazy  matt so top of the round we have  initiative of 25 to 20  marisha 20 shut up really  laura go keyleth  marisha i dont think thats ever happened before thats never happened  matt all right so keyleth a 20  20 to 15 anyone  travis 18  matt all right 15 to ten  taliesin 13  laura 14  travis this is our first live initiative  laura yeah  marisha yeah because it didnt happen  last time  
none	 travis were all going to die  matt scanlan and pike what did you guys get  ashley i rolled a big fat six  sam i got a four  matt the gnomes bringing up the rear  sam we were caught offguard by this whole thing she was teaching me the swirleywhirley  while this was all going on  ashley thats exactly what was happening  matt all right so keyleth youre up first you watch as this giant mass of a creature is now  clutching grog in its jaws and you see its tail begin 
none	 to whip up and its now guarding itself on  all sides as the roots are dragging themselves into the earth around you  marisha so it has roots it appears to be plantbased  matt elements of it as you get a closer look now you can see parts of its scaly hide emerge  into leaflike protrusions it is a strange mixture of both giant croc and some sort of a  plantbased entity  marisha okay im going to go a little risky here im going to cast speak with plants  matt all right  travis 
none	 look at mercers face  marisha dumb idea yeah  taliesin hes thinking an alligator voice is going to hurt a lot thats what hes thinking  matt this is a perfect keyleth moment so speak with plants generally works with plants  marisha sure but he appears to be fellow kin  laura hes got roots yo  matt he does however in the purposes of this type of circumstance its usually meant for  smaller plants that have no sentience that you can normally interact with like roses and petunias  marisha ive done this before  with 
none	 talking to the treant  matt you can probably communicate with it yes im saying issuing commands on this might be  a little more difficult for the rest of the spells  marisha what if i cast at a higher level  would that help  matt this is not a spell that can be cast at a higher level unfortunately so what do you want  to do youre casting speak with plants  marisha well i cast it so im going to say hey you spit that out of your mouth  right now mister  laughter 
none	  marisha you dont know where thats been  and trust me i do  matt make an intimidation check  cheering  laura no dont do it  taliesin laughs  travis no way theres no fucking way  sam in a way it doubled in its level  laura you do not touch that dice anymore  marisha seven  matt as you shout this out pointing at the large crocodilelike entity you look deep into its  beady black and purple eye that darts around in the sunken socket of its crocodile skull and you  can 
none	 see it reinitiate its clutch on grog readjusting pulling him even further into the  jaw grog you suffer another nine points of piercing damage  travis i take what  matt another nine points of piercing damage  travis nine points  taliesin yeah you havent raged yet  matt sorry keyleth are you going to stay  where you are  marisha where am i oh i see where i am can i move towards that tree away from the river  that also wants to eat us  matt sure you get that far before the rope 
none	 on your midsection stops you  travis oh shit were all tied together  marisha okay yeah all right cool done go  matt grog your turn  travis yeah where did he bite me by the way  matt he has you in his jaws by the midsection and hes trying to turn you so you lose your  footing and youre getting pretty close right now so he has you clamped right around your hip  and chest right now the nostrils right here and the other half of the jaw is almost completely  wrapped around the 
none	 side  travis i dont give a fuck i go into a rage  cheering  travis can i go into a frenzied rage  matt yes you may  travis and i use my bloodaxe  and im going to start whacking him  in his stupid plant monster face  matt all right so you use your bonus action to go into the rage and you have two attacks  so go for it  laura yeah kill him grog kill him  travis thats a 30  matt thatll hit  travis for the second one its 
none	 a 21  matt that also does hit yes roll damage  for both of those strikes  travis so the first one is a 19 plus five points of necrotic damage for 24  matt all right 24 points of damage  travis and the second one oh shit  thats 15 plus another five points  of necrotic damage for 20  matt 20 points fantastic so youre slamming it as hard as you can with the axe in the side  youre jamming it into the side you can see part of its jaw split open from 
none	 the impact and you can  see a gleaming of white slick bone beneath that begins to expose from where you slammed the sharp  end of the axe into it twice in a row its snarling shaking you in its grasp once more  travis ive always wanted to be a dog toy  taliesin uh i feel like were learning a lot  marisha have you told many people that  travis now i have  matt does that end your turn grog all right next is the crocs turn at the beginning of its  turn you 
none	 watch as the wound you just left begins to slowly seal shut you watch the roots  protruding from its body begin to suck the water moisture and life force from the land around it  and it begins to heal itself slowly so some of that damage goes away  sam goes away  matt it begins to heal itself healing from the ground its rooted into  travis i probably should have tried to break the grapple  laura that wouldve been a smart move  travis i havent hit anything in forever  matt grog 24 i 
none	 believe that hits  travis yeah that hits  matt you guys watch as the crocodile backs this way slightly which allows vax and garmelie to get  an attack of opportunity vax does hit well no it could be sneak attack although grog  technically right now is not threatening it  travis yeah i am im hitting it with a thing  laura garmelie is standing next to him too  matt ill let it sure the timing is pretty close on this and youll hear why in a second  sam seven more crocs appear  travis 
none	 im about to get jacked up  taliesin well see  matt 31 points of damage from vax garmelie misses he is awesome so as it pulls away you  guys watch as the crocodile spins around in the direction of you guys grabs and tugs grog  throwing him up into the air in doing so all of you guys get pulled this way and keyleth dragged  behind at that point the jaws open and grog vanishes down the creatures gullet  ashley no  taliesin were all still tied to him  laura were all attached to 
none	 him though  matt you all got dragged right to the edge of its mouth so right now percy you have the rope  right at the edge of its giant snapping jaws  travis were a big set of anal beads  taliesin can he roll for gag reflex theres a rope coming out of his throat  matt this creatures pretty profound at swallowing larger entities so thats fine  laughter  matt anyway grog youre currently blinded and restrained  travis blinded and restrained  matt yeah things go to darkness you now have a general idea 
none	 of what scanlan and vax went through  oh but a few days ago  travis singing hello darkness my old friend  matt cool yeah you are completely locked inside of it right there it also spins around as it does  so and its tail whiplash whips out and you see at the very tip of its tail what looks to be some  sort of strange jagged stinger this is going to whip around in the direction of you vex  laura me  matt that is going to be only a 14  laura oh good 
none	 it misses  matt yeah you duck under it as it scrapes across the ground causing this huge section of the dirt  to grind past leaving a small trough behind thats going to end its turn  it is now your turn vex  laura me okay i am going to send trinket out and attack it with bestial fury  matt trinket appears at the side of it suddenly spawning out of this strange burst of shadow  energy from the center of your necklace roars  laura trinket attack the thing  matt trinket happily does so 
none	 he has advantage on both of these strikes go for it  laura can i use my dagger thats on me to try to cut the rope that is attached to my front  matt you would have to pull a dagger out and that would be a bonus action so you can do that  now but you wouldnt be able to cut it  until next turn  laura okay well ill attack with trinket and ill pull my dagger out  matt okay  laura okay thats good wow i never attack with him how about that 
none	 26  matt hits  laura it does  matt yes  laura so does he do the bite attack or does he do the claw attack  matt well say the first one will be the bite and then the claw  laura okay so now hes rolling for claws okay so thats a 25 for the second one  matt both hit roll damage for each  laura okay oh jesus im so stupid  okay thats eight  matt eight  laura yeah  matt eight damage all right  laura and then for the next one 
none	 he gets two claws and hes going to use his fours jeez  louise five plus seven is 13 no 12  matt total of 20 points of damage  as trinket tears into the side  of this giant gatorlike creature  laura thats good and then i cast  hunters mark  matt as you pull your dagger out youre like hunters damn it but yeah at the beginning of  your next turn trying to hack away at that rope thats fine that ends your turn vex unless you  want to try and move  laura 
none	 can i try to fly up in the air it wont do anything im stuck on the ground  matt currently yes and you dont have your broom at the ready  laura no so ill stay where i am i guess ill continue to be flung around  matt perfect well done percy youre up  taliesin oh boy a lot of my plans got swallowed  travis muffled help me  taliesin okay im going to pull out the retort pistol because bad news will not be happy at this  range first thing im going to do 
none	 is im going to take a head shot im going to try and blind him  for the round this is going to go great  sam laura just quit the show  marisha she couldnt do it anymore  taliesin see im too nervous to even take sharpshooter so were just going to do this  clean and i roll a natural 20 fuck it  matt hey percy you are in melee with the creature you have disadvantage  on your ranged attack roll again  groaning  sam such a stickler  cheering  matt dont even 
none	 try it  taliesin the trick is not to care its good enough 26  matt okay that does hit  taliesin fuck i forgot to cast hex goddamn it can i throw my bonus in there really quick  sam theres children in the audience  taliesin they watch the show theyve heard me say worse can i sneak hex in there  matt i would say given the fact that you said specifically that you were too nervous to do  sharpshooter youre also too nervous to remember your hex but you can finish your turn with that 
none	  if youd like  taliesin i can get it in between attacks technically not  matt no thats true you can do it  ill let you  taliesin its a bonus action ill do whatever you say im not going to fight you im trying to  find my d10s okay here we are so thats  11 points of piercing damage  matt all right marking that down whats the save dc on that  taliesin the save dc is a 19  on a constitution save  matt that is a 12 so yes it is 
none	 currently blinded  taliesin its not blinded it has disadvantage on attacks until my next turn  matt there we go and you are hexing it  you said  taliesin and now im hexing im going to give him a disadvantage on strength checks  matt okay good to know  taliesin strength or constitution im not asking why am i asking people asking is for  quitters still at disadvantage because of the close proximity  matt correct  taliesin is his mouth open  matt the mouth is currently slightly open  taliesin am i close enough 
none	 to start laying in a few shots inside  matt maybe you can certainly try  taliesin im going to lay in a couple shots inside two more shots inside with hex attack  marisha hide behind his uvula grog  taliesin im going to try and go for the sides if i hit grog i dont care he can take it with  disadvantage thats a jam on the retort pistol wait no thats a save reroll fuck my life  okay so thats a jam and one to try and fix it really quickly just trying to give 
none	 it a clear  with not disadvantage because it doesnt matter  matt what did you roll as the jam  taliesin one  matt you rolled a natural one  taliesin yeah  matt okay roll damage anyway  taliesin roll damage anyway  matt yeah  taliesin i hate you  matt without the hex damage bonus  taliesin thats ten points of damage  matt grog you take ten points of piercing damage  taliesin i dont have a jam  matt but it does jam  taliesin okay so im going to do a clear  
none	 matt so as you go to fire it splinters off and theres a burst of smoke and the heat hurts your  finger and you hear this dull impact on the inside and a grunt  taliesin sorry  travis its halved right  matt its halved yes  taliesin one more shot  matt this is to try and clear it though  you still have to clear  taliesin i tried to clear it clears  i hit 16 plus  matt okay yeah so you manage to get it cleared and get it back and ready to 
none	 go  taliesin i dont have a third shot but now im at least reloaded do i need another round to  reload or does that count as a reload a clear  i can never remember  matt using it as an attack is a reload  taliesin okay so ill have to next turn okay ill just call that clear the last thing im  going to do is im going to move away from the crocodile with all my strength and im going to  say everybody pull and im backing up  matt make a strength 
none	 check  taliesin this is going to be so sad  marisha can we assist  matt if you want to use an action on your next turn to assist with this then yes  thatll be your action  taliesin it might be fine oh god  ashley come on percy  taliesin i have the worst strength eight  matt eight as you say everyone push away your feet feebly glide against the muddy surface  of the riverbank as the jaws open slightly and you hear the low guttural growling the breath  comes pouring out into 
none	 you in this strange combination of muddy swamp low tide and compost  its delightful  taliesin we technically have our hands free and are tied to the rope so in theory we could still  use our hands and just try and all shift backwards like stupid people  matt but youre all mostly taut on the rope now so you can thats what you tried to do and it  failed miserably thats your turn percy vax is up now vax tries to push inward actually no  hes going to stay where he is out of range 
none	 hes going to try and throw his daggers  from where he is  laura come on brother  matt he is not going to use his haste boots though hes going to save that for later thats  two attacks both hit so with the first strike and with the offhand throw the first one with  sneak attack because it is currently next to percy you are threatening it at the moment  taliesin i hope i have its attention  matt 28 points of damage and the second strike for a total of nine so after vax 
none	 throws both  daggers both sink into the sides of the giant crocodile it moves ever so slightly with the  first impact the second one seemingly to no effect both daggers appear in a puff of smoke to  the side of his belt and he looks to you and goes sister what are we going to do  laura i dont know  matt he cant really move at that point it is now garmelies turn  laura oh garmelie  matt garmelie who cant turn invisible who cant use his normal tactics is just um  laura 
none	 sing a song garmelie charm him do something  matt he pulls up a small pan flute from his side and whistling theres an awkward pause and he  goes shit he then tries to scoot away as far as he can but is once again caught between the  very taut sides of the rope unable to shift  that brings us to pike  ashley okay how far are we from the disgusting thing  matt you guys are over here so id say from what you can gauge here  youre approximately 40 feet from it  
none	 ashley 40 feet great so im going to get a little bit closer  matt you go right up to the edge of the water toes dipping in  ashley im going to use my trusty old friend guiding bolt im going to guiding bolt his face  matt of course you are  ashley and im going to do it at 5thlevel because my best friend is in his belly  sam pike im standing right next to you  ashley i know  matt so that is 8d6 damage if you hit go ahead and roll your radiant 
none	 attack against it  spell attack bonus roll a d20  ashley roll a d20  matt roll a d20 add your spell attack bonus yeah  ashley oh no thats terrible 15  matt 15 just hits  laura how many d6s  travis she needs two more d6s  laura i have two more here we go  matt so 8d6 points of radiant damage and it is currently marked for an advantage on the next  attack against it as a giant bright light now bursts across the front of its head causing its  eyes to 
none	 retract and close in pain snarling  marisha come on big money no whammies  travis theres math happening  taliesin its really hard to count up here  sam so exciting  ashley 24  matt 24 not too shabby 24 points of radiant damage and the glowing divine beacon now flashing  in the center of its face causing it to close its eyes the next person that wants to make an attack  is going to have a nice little bonus is that the end of your turn youre going to stay right there  at the 
none	 edge of the river  ashley yes  matt okay thats the end of your turn pike scanlan youre up  travis help me  sam i cant  travis oh youre all the way over  sam im across the river im going to help everyone else but you  can i inspire anyone over there  matt theyre within 60 feet  sam okay ill inspire keyleth ill sing to her singing believe it or not  youre killing a croc  you never thought you could feel so free  slashing away on a giant fucking croc 
none	  how can it be  believe it or not its because of me  laughter and applause  sam and i will take out my wand of magic missiles and fire many of them i think if i use six  charges thats eight darts  matt thats a lot of missiles  sam its not very powerful though and i would not like to shoot at the croc i would like  to shoot at every segment of rope  between every single person  cheering  matt after the flash of the guiding bolt the rest of 
none	 the party you look across the way as you  see scanlan after singing this delightful song turn around rambostyle and release this burst of  arcane energy these arcane darts come firing straight towards the croc and in a moment of  excitement expecting each of these impacts to blast into the side of this creature they  suddenly soar up into the sky and arc down  towards each of you  before you have a moment to really react the word leaving your voice what they streak back down  slamming into each side of the rope 
none	 causing it to burst into frayed burnt rope chunks and pieces of  twine all hanging loosely to your sides all of you guys are now free to move about as you wish  sam and for my movement i will grab pike around the waist and pull us back five feet off the edge  of the pond there thanks  matt well done top of the round again  keyleth youre up  marisha okay you have advantage  on the next hit on it  matt anybody whoever has the next attack roll against it has advantage 
none	  marisha i am going to cast 5thlevel blight on him he is a plant creature i get how much extra  matt well it makes the saving throw with disadvantage and the spell deals maximum damage  to it so whats the spell dc of this  marisha 19  sam heres the big roll guys  matt 19 you can come look at it if you want to  audience disadvantage  matt i understand chuckles 15 this is going to suck so that is 64 points of necrotic damage  marisha i said spit him out that 
none	 is caca  spit it out  matt as you clench your hand like this you guys watch as the roots that connect to its body  suddenly begin to wither and dry out you watch as the outside bark then cracks and turn to ash  and dust at its side and its once verdant green hide begins to curl into this dull gray lifeless  husk the creatures eyes spring open and its low guttural growl turns to this horrible  shrieking pain sound from the inside grog you feel everything tense around you as its form all 
none	  of a sudden is being drained of the life essence and water that keeps it going it manages to  recover and the life pumps back into parts of it but that sucked that is not a happy creature  applause  matt oh that was fun to build the tension on that one all right keyleth thats your action  what else would you like to do for your turn  marisha i want to move and flank him a little bit if i can get on his six the other way  matt all right so you 
none	 move past to this side  marisha thats good closer a little bit  to him one more closer  matt sure closers great  marisha no back one back no its fine  matt grog youre up youre currently still constrained inside its body the tautness of the  rope around your waist has gone slack so in a moment you realize either your friends are dead  or they managed to break the rope you would think that if you werent so full of anger and rage at  being shot and squeezed and devoured by a giant 
none	 crocodile what are you doing  travis can i reach the jug at all  matt well say you can take your action to reach into your bag of holding and pull it out yes  sam i thought he had it out already it was on his head right  matt well he had it out earlier have you had it on your head this whole time  travis i had it tilted up so i could see  matt if that was the case the sheer force of the creature biting you initially and throwing you  onto 
none	 the bank wouldve tossed that jug quite a ways away from you  laura then it wasnt there  travis yeah well retcon that shit  it was in my pocket  matt thats what i thought so do you want to spend your action to rummage through the bag of  holding and pull out the jar  travis and thats my action  matt that would be your action yes you can use your bonus action to attack  because youre in a frenzied rage  travis no fuck it  taliesin youre still raging too  because 
none	 i hit you  travis yeah but i cant hit anything  im like this  matt you have disadvantage on your attacks you can still attack him from the inside  travis can i take the titanstone knuckles  smash them together  cheering  travis can i cast enlarge on myself  matt you can certainly try is that what you want to do  travis yeah ill try that  matt as your mind is suddenly clouded with the thought of jug i need to get the jug no  you feel your body your physical form 
none	 begin to ripple and swell you guys watch as the crocodile  now currently recovering from the blightlike withering of its form suddenly its eyes go wide  once more as its gullet begins to swell wider and wider you hear this low retching like a cat  coughing up a hairball slowed down as you watch an enlarged grog get immediately vomited up  and out of the creature to its side  sam his favored terrain is vomit  matt yes you do have benefits to that so yes you manage to do that sir  travis so 
none	 i get puked out can i use whatever movement speed i have left to drag the daisy chain  with me away from the crocodile  matt okay as you rush away he gets an attack of opportunity on you  travis oh yeah it got separated  matt it does have disadvantage because you shot it last turn which is good because the second  roll was a natural 20 thats a total of 20 to hit whats your armor class  travis 20  matt okay so it just hits you with the bite  sam can i 
none	 cutting words him  matt you do have a reaction so yes you may  sam okay i will cutting words him ill say mmgrog vocalizing grog vocalizing yeah  its supposed to distract him  matt yeah its not inspiring somebody it is intended to distract the opponent and this  crocodile probably having a rather rough time in the early 2000s manages to provide even more bile  from its stomach at the sound of a rehashed hanson song go ahead and make your roll  sam what do i roll  matt you roll your inspiration die 
none	  sam eight  matt no its a d10  sam d10 eight  matt you were intent on that happening as it reaches out to try and bite towards grog it hears  the sound and its head quirks vomits a little grog you manage to get away at that point well  say about that far as you turn around the daisy chain has not followed you glancing down the  rope that was once around your waist has snapped by the growth in size and all the rest of the  ropes have also been snapped sorry 
none	  laura hey youre out  matt perfect that ends your turn it is now the crocs turn its going to make a bite attack  right now this is going to be at percy since youre right there in front of him  taliesin bring it  sam dont worry i wont sing hanson again  matt with disadvantage that is a 23  taliesin that hits  matt that hits you all right as the head turns back towards you it opens to the side  and tries to clamp on you  taliesin im using my new 
none	 fancy counter  marisha yeah your counter ring  taliesin im so excited to take damage  matt that is a 34  taliesin im not that excited to take damage 34  matt 34 points of piercing damage and you are currently grappled and restrained  taliesin grappled and restrained  marisha wait hes in the crocodiles mouth now  matt the crocodile has now snapped its jaws moving to percy and percy youre currently held  tight in its jaws its trying to lift you up now possibly to fill its now terribly empty stomach  it lost 
none	 more than it originally started this battle with as it swings around its tail in  doing so its stinger sweeps overhead it has a reach of ten at this point well say in that arc  there this is going to be towards vex towards you vex with disadvantage still thats a 21  whats your armor class  laura fuck i mean 20  matt 20 okay so it still hits you all right so the stinger whipcrack grinds itself into your  flesh tears through the armor separation there and you can feel pulsing i need you 
none	 to go ahead  and make a constitution saving throw  laura because thats my strength  taliesin you got this  laura do i  taliesin you do  laura ten  matt well you take 16 points of piercing damage from the actual stinger itself striking you you  now feel that pulse of venom through your body and as it begins to swell through you you feel  all the colors and all the images of the landscape around you begin to shift and bubble and move  marisha youre tripping man  matt you are tripping 
none	 balls right now you look  to your left and see garmelie next to you  whose frightened expression becomes suddenly  this giant feral wolverine that hisses at you  you look to your right and you see the giant  crocodile holding percy suddenly merge  into one strange giant medusa creature  you dont know which way is up and down  and you are extremely frightened and confused  marisha youre frightened  oh no its a bad trip  laura does that mean i lose my turn  matt well that ends the crocodiles turn 
none	 and it is now your turn currently you cannot take  reactions and i need you to roll a d8 to see what you do  sam wait it could be anything  matt chuckles youre so stunned by this moment and your brain being completely turned around  what did you roll  laura i rolled a five  matt roll of five okay you take no action and you use all of your movement to move in a random  direction you go into the river you turn around and begin to flee looking ahead of you you 
none	 see  what seems to be a moving sea of grass and all of a sudden you feel your feet splashing the river  begins to pull you away at the end of your turn  marisha son of a bitch oh shit  laura bye  matt make another constitution saving throw  laura oh good okay oh natural 20  ashley she turns back time  matt as soon as your vision comes back to you and a breath of relief hits your form as suddenly you  have control of your form as it begins to be 
none	 sucked under the water end of your turn  percy youre up  taliesin so im grappled  theres nothing i can do  matt youre restrained you can attack you cant move and all your attacks have disadvantage  taliesin and everything i have at least at the moment anything with a gun is at disadvantage  oh but ive got hex on him so even if i hit him with a sword its an extra d6 im going to try  and start hacking him to let me go ooh weird question if i use the dropit effect 
none	 the grit  drop an item can i get him to drop me  as an item  matt i dont think you count as an item im sorry  taliesin sticking him in the jaw i cant get him to i cant make him roll to drop  matt i dont think thats how it works its not like you hit a couple fingers and they drop a cup  this is a massive muscle currently clamped on you trying to swallow you  taliesin i was hoping  matt i know sorry  taliesin okay in that case 
none	 im going to grab my sword and start hacking at him  matt okay so well say you use your bonus action to draw your weapon its right there by your  side you pull it out go ahead and make your attacks against the crocodile  taliesin okay thats a 15  matt 15 just barely hits  sam okay you had advantage on them  taliesin did i no i dont have advantage  for these  matt actually technically it would have been the first attack since pikes guiding bolt thank you  for the reminder of 
none	 that so it wouldve been a normal attack  taliesin that was the first attack since her guiding bolt  marisha no i thought i attacked  matt yours didnt have a spell attack it just instantly hit and made a save so technically  what was your first roll  taliesin 15  matt yeah you hit  taliesin okay the next roll wasnt a 20 so it doesnt matter anyway  matt the guiding bolt wears off however that did manage to get rid of the disadvantage on that  one strike seeing the bright side of its 
none	 face you take your blade out and hack downward for the  first hit which does strike true across the side of its face you can make your next two attacks  taliesin thats 28  matt those do have disadvantage  taliesin okay in that case natural 20 oh it has disadvantage though so its still the 28  sam matt if i can be a stickler i also cutting wordsed him so that puts him at disadvantage  on a save  matt on his next saving throw but hes not making a saving throw  sam this 
none	 is a kangaroo court  matt and if im going to be a stickler here sam the next time he has a saving throw  ill keep the disadvantage in mind  laura oh youre in trouble samuel  taliesin all right so that hit and then for my last one thats not bad 21  matt yeah all three strikes hit go ahead and roll damage on all those  taliesin let me get my new d8 thats super  oh i can get all my d8s and then 3d6 for some  necrotic damage so thats 13 points 
none	 of necrotic damage and 37 points of slashing damage  marisha kill it  matt slamming into the side of its face you begin splitting open a section of the side of its  head you can see its cracked withered form from the blight spell earlier has become a little more  brittle and each impact is cutting deeper than any of the previous hits has  were going to take a quick break here  five tenminute break to use the restroom  and return to the apex of this battle  break  travis is this for 
none	 me motherfuckers  laura youre so low  taliesin oh god that game again  laura grog its all for grog  is it just for you  travis yeah  matt so on vaxs turn vax is going to go ahead and dart around this way behind garmelie getting  to where trinket is flanking along the river bend there  laura oh are we just right back in  matt as he does pull out of the range of the tail the croc can go ahead and make an attack of  opportunity with the stinger out towards 
none	 him behind that is not going to hit that is a  natural four thats going to be like a 16 so yeah as it swings with its tail wide to vax vax  ducks beneath it arms up to the side leaps in the air and catches himself right on the edge of  the bank he looks over and notices you running off to the side  laura me me help me  matt immediately decides to put his daggers back away and then uses a dash action to dart over to  the edge of the river 
none	 where you are and is going to reach out and try and grab your arms you guys  are reaching for each other right now that is how its going to go for this moment that brings us  to garmelie who now free of the rope circumstance and the chaos around looks and sees  you out in the river scoots around goes out with grabs your brothers arm and then reaches  out towards your arm and chains his way towards you putting his hand towards you  laura garmelies helping  marisha garmelie  matt grab  
none	 laura okay  taliesin its a sign hes going to turn on us  at any moment  laura i know  matt so you guys grab and link arms at that point hes going to go ahead and make a strength  check to pull you out of the roaring rapids okay he manages to hold in the moment but doesnt  actually get any ground on pulling you out of the river so now its just him and vax holding you at  the edge the rivers pulling you harder and harder and you can feel the actual 
none	 swell getting  stronger but theyre still managing to keep you in place that ends his turn pike youre up  ashley okay how is the monster crocodile plant doing is he looking rough  matt hes looking hurt  ashley is he regenerating himself  matt youve noticed each time its had a moment to itself its roots have dug in and its pulled  back into its form yeah it has been still regenerating every round yes  ashley thats bullshit  travis it really is  ashley you know what im going to hold off on that 
none	 then no you know what  im going to flame strike him  matt what are you doing on him  ashley just the old flame strike  matt sure all righty where do you want that flame strike to land  ashley just on his whole body  matt wherever you see it  onto the middle of its body  ashley oh where do i want to see it  maybe his torso area  laura where it wont hurt anybody else around  matt as you look over in the distance unable to really see beyond the 
none	 form of the creature you  bring the flame strike down onto its form its going to make a saving throw with disadvantage  because of your cutting words which is good because it rolled a 17 for the first one and it  rolled a 15 for the second one no dex bonus for it because its not very fast your dc is  ashley 18  matt 18 yes 8d6 radiant damage  go ahead and roll that  laura wait heres some more d6 take them  matt thats a tenfoot radius ill say for the sake 
none	 of knowledge in the area too and seeing  trinket attack you manage to pull it out of the range of the bear not wanting to ignite him  scanlan youre up next  sam yeah i know  matt how much fire and divine damage  ashley 28  matt 28 points of damage as you guys see this gathering of small reddish and white divine  particles circle in the air faster and faster and then boom a column of divine flame strikes  from the heavens blasting into the side of this creature it rears back roars 
none	 in pain as you see  now its slightly withered blightimpacted grayishgreen back is now burnt to a black crisp  and smoke begins to rise off of its form  its very pissed off  travis monster  matt is that the end of your turn pike  are you going to stay where you are  ashley hows everybody doing  taliesin im a little iffy but im okay  ashley youre a little iffy yeah i want to healing word percy  matt whats the range on it  ashley 60 feet  matt 60 feet yeah

none	 spellcasting modifier  matt no just add plus five  ashley okay so then it would be 13  because i rolled two fours  matt all right scanlan what are you doing  sam is it a large creature i know its large but how large  matt it would be classified as a huge creature  sam okay well then forget that okay im going to eyebite him with my eyes of craziness put up  the hand cone and im going to try  to make him sick  matt all righty so lets take its wisdom 
none	 saving throw against your dc that is a six with no  modifier it is certainly sickened though its disadvantage has worn off of course  taliesin theres so many rings on it  its great  sam and i wont really move but i will inspire grog because he needs to hit something man  travis im telling you  sam ill inspire him with a limerick  a warning from your favorite bard in the feywild you should be on guard  i went off to take a shitter and saw like a thousand critters  cheering  
none	 sam and they kind of made me hard  cheering  matt take your inspiration die grog  all right staying where you are scanlan  sam staying where i am  matt keyleth youre up  marisha oh its me oh dear god okay i am going to do what worked really well last time and  im going to do a 4thlevel blight and what i want to do is i want to take my staff because  im near him right  matt you are  marisha okay i want to take my staff and where pike 
none	 put that nice little crispy donut hole in the  middle of him i want to take my staff right in the middle and bring it down and cast blight  matt all righty saving throw against the dc with disadvantage a six and an eight  laughter and applause  matt how do you want to do this  cheering and chanting keyleth  marisha thats the coolest thing  thats ever happened to me  matt you hear the phantom chanting in the back of your head how do you want to do this  marisha my ego 
dung	 loves this is percy still in his mouth  matt percy is still in its mouth yes  marisha okay im going to say stop putting foreign objects in your mouth  matt as you slam your staff into the ground with a giant ripple all of a sudden you watch as the  various plant growth in the ground begins to turn to a dark black gray at the base of the staff it  curls across the ground like the actual line of blighted death and decay seems to spear out  across it manages to catch the 
none	 bottom and sink up the roots of the creature as it begins to swell  up into its body you see it taking form  how do you want the blight spell  to take hold in its body  marisha it takes hold okay how about this  you know the petrified forests in arizona  can i petrify him  matt all right so as the blight spell spirals across his body like a spider web crackling it  begins to snarl it rears up with its arms out in front of it taut the muscles locking up 
none	 like  this giant arching statue its jaws up in the air holding percy aloft  laughter  matt you hear the scraping and cracking of bark and dried plant matter its entire form slightly  squeaking as it becomes a solid petrified piece of plant matter the life force now drained from  it the roots at its sides crack and turn to ash part of its form tends to sink to one side of the  mud and now this once very dangerouslooking creature is solid dead plant matter holding a  wiggling and very unhappy human  
none	 cheering  marisha hey percy  hows the weather up there  taliesin ow  laura i would be cheering for you if i wasnt drowning at this very moment  matt on that note too i need you  to make a strength check  laura oh well thats a 15 there  actually thats a straight check  thats not a saving throw  matt right just a check  laura 13  matt chuckles you and vax and garmelie still hold your ground but unfortunately not a whole  lot of physical strength in this daisy chain 
none	 right now  laura can i ask trinket to come up and help  matt you can yes and trinket rushes over moans comes up behind vax and bites the back of  his cloak and begins tugging on him as hes now being slightly strangled by the bear pulled back  toward trinket adding his strength to that  whats trinkets strength bonus  laura yeah four hes stronger than me  matt with a roll of a 17 that brings it to a 21 whereas you began to pull them in towards the  river trinket makes up 
none	 the back end of it and manages to drag all of you out of the wake onto  the side as you get up and cough out the water trinket comes up to you and nuzzles you  on the side of your face  laura thanks buddy  matt moans  laura i get up and hug garmelie what you saved me youre wonderful  matt what was i supposed to do watch you drown no were almost to the end of our agreement  laura i tousle his hair good job keyleth  marisha thanks  laura how 
none	 you doing percy  taliesin grog could you help with this  travis do i get to chop down a tree finally  laughter  taliesin i really wanted alligator boots  but i suppose that will do please help  travis do i get to chop him i start chopping down the petrified alligator tree  laura trinket catch him when he falls  taliesin what  matt trinket rushes up and looks up at you underneath with open jaws  taliesin no  matt as grog large grog comes lumbering up heavy footsteps whack with one clean hit 
none	 the  bloodaxe carves straight through its body causing the upper part of the torso to slam into  the ground with a big speed upon the impact it rolls a few feet taking percy in its jaws  taliesin oh ow  matt you do suffer two points of damage from it but eventually you hit a point in the bank where  the jaw cracks into a hundred pieces and you tumble onto the ground and catch your breath  after being restrained for so long  taliesin i stand up and kick one of them  marisha 
none	 keyleth wants to get down on the grass that she hurt and i want to cast druidcraft and  heal it and talk to the grass and be like it wasnt personal i hope you know you were not the  intended target you just happened to be caught in the fray its okay dont be mad  matt as you extend your fingers about you you see small strands of green go popping and you  hear a hundred soft voices go eh  marisha i like your enthusiasm grass  laura all right how are you doing over 
none	 there gnomesies  ashley come on you should get over here no rush but  taliesin all right theres a river  sam dont forget to loot the body  laura theres nothing to loot on the petrified alligator is there  taliesin actually theres an empty stomach isnt there  travis its made of petrified wood  taliesin im going to stick my head in and see if theres anything in there  matt okay the very tiny pressed stomach interior of this creature petrified as it is  its like staring into one of those weird high school 
none	 science room halfman organ presentation  statues you can see where the folds of the stomach lining are there appear to be some  remnants of bone some entities that were partially digested but nothing that catches your  eye to be something worth pulling out of it  taliesin just for fun grog smash this  travis okay whack  matt and with that shatter the pieces of it go scattered all across the ground elements of it  tumble into the water and get washed away  it is no more  travis how was that  taliesin 
none	 anything exciting come out  matt many small petrified crocodile pieces  taliesin im going to pick one up  and bring it to keyleth for you well done  applause  marisha i get a souvenir from the feywild  thats all i wanted  travis weve got two more rivers right  matt one more technically you guys have all made your way across theres one last one that  leads to the outskirts of the shademirk  laura i want to keep perception check up  to make sure we dont run into  another one of 
none	 those fuckers  matt go ahead and make a perception check  travis listen hey is anybody near death im super big right now how about i just throw  everybody across the river  ashley ill go  travis you want to  marisha im in  travis can i throw pike across the river  matt make a strength check  laura yeah pikes already across  22 for perception  travis wait i need you to smack me in the face first impact i would like to rage natural 20  ashley im going to get in 
none	 a ball  matt which you have disadvantage on hold on because you took a point of exhaustion from frenzied  raging during the battle however you do get advantage on strength checks while raging so its  a singular roll so the natural 20 stands so as you pick pike up she smacks you in the face the  grin crawls across and you whoosh lob her she lands in the top of a tree you see cracking in  the bushes as a few leaves dangle down you can see some gloppy black stuff out of the side 
none	 and  you hear this muffled voice in the distance as pike landed okay  ashley shes laughing that was awesome  travis should i try and skip vax across the river  laughter  marisha yeah do it  matt vax says id rather run and he goes running forward and attempts to make a leap across  the river he leaps makes it most of the way catches his ankle on the edge  and begins to flutter backward  travis thats what you get stupid  laura cant you save him  arent you on the other 
none	 side  sam im looking at the trees im hanging out  matt yeah however he does manage to right himself he only got partially into the river and  managed to pull his way out so hes fine grog who are you throwing next  travis whos next  taliesin ill go  travis yeah percys next  can i granny shot this one  matt go for it strength check  travis 19  matt grunts you lob him its enough to get you across but the landing is not very graceful  taliesin can i acrobatics check 
none	 this to try  and make the landing  marisha threepoint landing  taliesin thatll be a 21  matt 21 you manage to use the actual momentum  to go into a shoulder roll stumble forward and you  come to a standing point however when you do you realize you rolled through a bunch of slick  tarlike muck and the side of your jacket is now seeping with it  taliesin i was already covered in crocodile bile  matt there you go you feel balanced  taliesin this is another layer of sadness  travis whos 
none	 next  laura ill go next but i want to bring out my broom and hold it in my hand  travis in the spirit of the olympic games  can i shot put her  matt make a strength check  you see trinket come up  laura come on  matt trinket goes into your necklace  travis oh shit no its not its a 23  im strong as fuck  matt i would say the lighter half of the twins but i think theyre an equal weight class you  grab her by the side and 
none	 whoosh grunt launch her into the air you catch your stomach contents  make an acrobatics check  laura thats okay thats a 28 man  matt you actually catch yourself on the side of the tree landing and then leap off of it with  the last bit of momentum stepping gingerly  on the tips of your feet  ashley i clap from however far away i am  matt you hear muffled clapping in the tree boughs ahead of you  laura i fly up and i grab pike down from the tree can i do that 
none	  matt shes about 15 feet up  laura oh i fly 15 feet up and grab pike  ashley thanks i didnt know  how i was going to get down  travis are you left  marisha im left  travis do you want to go with me  as i jump across or should i throw you  laura piggyback that shit keyleth  sam i wave my hands and say  ill catch you kiki  marisha okay you want to shot put this one  travis no its going to be fastpitch softball  marisha 
none	 okay  travis no wait im going to be a long snapper in football and turn around  laughter  sam i will receive that set  travis 19  marisha hut  matt grunts with a big long toss you make it most of the way over the water and begin to  descend very close on the opposite side of the bank make an acrobatics check  sam use your new dice  marisha no fuck that new dice nine not great  matt the good news is you miss the river the bad news is you warner 
none	 brothers cartoon faceplant  into the actual ground on the opposite side  laughter  matt suffering 11 points of damage and as percy pulls you up your entire front of your face and  the little bit of hair in the crown is caked with this tarlike substance your nostrils are filled  with it you cant open your eyes it tastes like ihop its terrible  ashley hey  matt tonights episode of critical role not brought to you by ihop  and probably never will be  ashley there goes our ihop sponsorship  marisha i gag 
none	 a little try to keep it down try to wash my face if i can  sam whos left garmelie  laura oh garmelie  matt garmelies on the side he goes  dont worry you first  laura no hes going to leave i mean he can  i guess you got us all the way here didnt you  matt once hes across our accord is complete  travis oh yeah no totally come here bitch  matt no roll an attack well technically this is a grapple so its an athletics check  travis a 20 total 
none	  matt you reach out and his eyes go wide and he darts around and your fingers barely catch the edge  of his fur and you get enough of a hold to lift him off the ground hes now dangling from your  giant halfgiant ass hand  no i dont have to go there  im just going back the other way  when were done  travis oh no yeah i totally hear what youre saying were going for a ride bitch  and i back up  matt make an athletics check  travis 20 again 
none	 12 plus eight  matt your large bounding form  heavy footsteps impact scream  as you make it across you hit the other side  the actual bank shifts and you guys feel  the impact on the other side beneath your feet  and theres a small crater in the ground  where you landed and the river bank slowly fills it in as it lowers it just below river water level  garmelie is now clutching your arm  his hands and legs wrapped around your forearm  laughter  matt his head was on the other 
none	 side he eventually loosens his grip plops to the ground  and dusts himself off a bit very well  welcome to the shademirk good luck  laura we made it  travis you dont want to see  what happens at the end of the journey  you want to come with us right  matt he looks past you and you all turn and look into the shademirk at this point you can see the  bog itself is an endless dumping form of sludge into the gilded run the water itself is barely  tearing it away 
none	 what you guys noticed before the black oily material is itself thick ichorlike  tar the smell that youre very familiar with that horrible acrid sulfurous scent is very  thick in the area mixed with a terrible rotting leaf and decay you see bubbles going bubbling  and churning up in certain parts of it and there are elements where you see knotted and gnarled  roots that tangle up above the surface it is the most uninviting place in nature youve ever seen  and experienced and you can see in the distance the swamp trees with high 
none	 root sections overhead  so you can walk underneath are scattered throughout ahead of you  garmelie slowly turns his head back to you and goes no im all right but i appreciate that  be careful dont stay in one place too long  the longer you stand still the harder it gets  to escape the place you stood and theres a lot  of things that tend to live here from what ive  heard that wait for stillness  as a means of attack so keep moving  laura keep moving  travis what kinds of 
none	 things  matt i dont know its time for me to go  thank you guys so much i appreciate this  its been something  laura wait before he goes  i want to give him a kiss on his head  matt a little kiss on the head and he goes well at least its been a pleasure travelling  with you my lady he takes your hand  and does a little bow and kiss on the edge  laura as i was kissing him  can i give him a little pat down  to make 
none	 sure he didnt steal anything  laughter and applause  matt make an investigation check  laura 23  matt 23 as you feel down you feel this slight little bump inside of his fur and youre afraid  to touch it for fear of it being on the outside of his body not that you understand  the physicality of the satyr but still its hard  and smooth and appears to wiggle loosely  when you touch it  laura well now i feel wrong saying i reach  for it and try to see what it is 
none	  matt do you reach for it  laura yeah  matt all right  marisha youre committed now  matt grasping onto it you tug and pull forth the small onyx mastiff that you had found earlier  in the campground  laura i take it back  matt he goes oh thats right i was holding this for you  laura thank you so much youre so kind  travis the little black dog statue  oh i like that thing  matt fantastic well wish you all the best of luck stay alive  travis wait a 
none	 minute how do you plan on getting back across the rivers  matt i have my ways and he turns invisible you see little sludgy footprints go off down  the shore and around the bend  marisha bye  taliesin cast hunters mark really quick  laura oh on him can i cast hunters mark on him really quick  matt what do you want to do  laura can i cast hunters mark on him  matt you cannot currently see him now  hes already vanished  laura sorry i shouldve done it when i was kissing 
none	 him but i was distracted  by feeling him up  matt it happens all right  so what are you guys going to do  travis awesome so were across the rivers everything gets worse now  and we cant stop moving  taliesin we should move until its time to camp and when we camp  we should camp in your palacious  laura oh in the mansion  sam ive got the mansion  laura thank god  marisha are we in the bog now  matt this would be the tangleward tip of it the southern 
none	 tip of the bog yes  marisha i want to test and see if we sink  when we step on the bog  matt okay you step onto it and your foot descends about three inches  before it comes to a stop squelch  marisha it comes to a stop  matt but as you go to remove your foot sucking sound its very sticky effectively you guys  are at half movement moving through the bog  laura i cast pass without trace on us so that we can be stealthy she doesnt have mist form  
none	 not until we rest  marisha i could rest and learn mist and we can mist across that was what i was going to say  travis is it a treeline are we into trees  matt yeah it is a very thickly wooded swamp now the ground floor and the base of most of the  trees and occasionally dripping from the top of the canopy itself is that black  sludgelike material  travis its dripping from the trees  matt its seemingly seeping from everything  laura i have lands stride does that mean that this doesnt 
none	 affect me  or am i still slowed down  matt read out lands stride to me  laura lands stride isnt on any of my pieces of paper oh wait here it is moving through  nonmagical difficult terrain costs you  no movement  matt technically yes you can move at your normal pace the rest of the party  still has to stay slowed  laura then ill tell you what im going to do im going to pull out my broom and im going to  let the gnomes ride on it since you guys will 
none	 sink down a little bit more than the rest of us  do you want to ride on the broom  sam how do we do that  laura you sit on it and then you fly  sam do we have to say a magical word  laura ill say it for you  taliesin i dont think it works that way  i think you have to tell them  and then they have to say it  laura oh really  matt you can try its up to you  laura sit on it  sam okay 
none	 whenever a woman tells me  to sit on something i do  laughter  ashley do you want front or back  travis yeah sit on it front or back  sam ill sit front so you can have your arms around me  ashley okay  laura thats sweet hacking spit  matt okay as you guys get up onto the broom you release it from your grasp and it goes splat  onto the ground both of you guys sink about three or four inches into the ground  laura say hacking spit  ashley and sam 
none	 hacking spit  matt it lifts up and pulls you guys slowly out of the sludge squelch finally freeing yourself  and youre now hovering a very short distance above the ground  laura so at least you guys and me arent slowed down so thats good  sam bye guys  travis by the way now that were out of all this shit can we look around and see if ukurat  has been peeping us this entire time  laura can we see him  matt make a perception check  laura were not in the forest anymore 
none	  this is bog  travis 15  matt right now technically its swamp yeah  not considered forest  taliesin 16  laura 20  sam 16 here  marisha oh my god its a 31  matt as you guys take a moment to look out in the distance youre unable to really make any idea of  a form or movement keyleth you do see on the tree on the other bank it looks a little thicker  towards the top than you expect and as you take a moment to glance you can see a rather 
none	 large creature  drop down from the canopy onto the ground and then slink behind it  laura so hes checking us out  matt hes following you  laura so hes going to be able to get across  all these rivers  taliesin apparently hes fine  laura hes pretty cool he can jump really far  marisha i give him a from a distance  matt he shrinks sideways against the tree and is now barely visible other than his furry chest  thats now peeking out one side  of the width of the tree  
none	 marisha i give him a  matt no reaction vax at this point is like  so are we going to move on then  laura yes but stealthily  matt lets do it make a stealth check guys  laura i cast pass without trace on us so we all got plus ten  ashley oh  laura did you get something good  ashley i did  travis i fucked it all up  laughter  sam 32  matt 32  sam i rolled a natural 20  cheering  matt percy  taliesin 33  matt 
none	 keyleth  marisha 24  matt all right vex  laura 32  matt 32 pike  ashley i rolled a 30 im so quiet  matt and over here we have 12foottall grog what did you roll  travis i rolled a 14  matt you guys begin trudging forward into the shademirk everyones being kind of  and hes lumbering through it like a mammoth  travis were being sneaky guys  matt you all shush him and you find ways to cushion his footfalls as unstealthy as you may be  in the moment the rest of 
none	 the party helps try to keep you going forward the best they can being  unheard you guys continue forward for about 30 minutes not really understanding the direction  you know that heavy mountain that you saw on the way in is central and to the right of your  direction and youre not entirely certain where the tree is here in the shademirk but youre  keeping your eyes peeled and you continue to move forward further and further in it is difficult  it is hot it is muggy there are heavy insects large winged bugs buzzing 
none	 through the air and  you knock them away the bubbling of the ground itself is releasing sulfurous gas and various  other chemicals into the air that are probably not healthy to breathe extensively many of you are  having to cover your mouth to keep from coughing to break up your stealth capabilities  taliesin im going to mask it  matt put your mask on okay  laura can i keep an eye out for any movement ahead of us or around us  matt make a perception check yes  travis i only stay enlarged for 
none	 ten minutes  matt at this point it has now died down and your form has shifted to its normal form  travis do i get to reroll my stealth check  matt no  laura 29  matt as you guys move forward and vex is keeping watch vex you see ahead of you about 80 yards  a large stocky tree in the distance that has  a gentle glow emanating from the trunk  sam burn it down  taliesin that simple  laura does it look  like the tree were looking for  matt its 
none	 hard to say at this distance you would have to get closer to get a better look  travis how far off is it  matt about 80 yards  laura 80 yards fuck im so scared  of everything here  travis well whats between us and it  matt a series of trees and a few low areas of open sludge  laura and its a tree with a glowing bottom  matt it looks thicker than a lot of the other trees that youve seen in the area  and theres a dull glow at the base 
none	 of it  travis ive got a great idea lets send trinket to go check out the tree  laura what the fuck why  travis hes a bear and this is the woods  taliesin this is not the woods this is a bog  laura if he goes unconscious he does automatically come back but no thats only  within 100 feet thats not 80 yards no  taliesin so take the broom back  and fly 100 feet behind him its an idea  marisha but were only 80 yards out feet 80 feet  laura im 
none	 not slowed down so you know what  im going to sneak behind trinket  ill send trinket out and ill sneak  100 feet behind him  matt trinket emerges impact in the sludge moans  laura im sorry buddy okay dont get too far ahead of me were going to sneak ahead  and check out this glowy tree see it  matt grunts  laura yeah all right sneakysneaky  matt and trinket manages to stalk forward make a stealth check for trinket without the plus ten  because trinket was not around  when you cast 
none	 the spell  laura thats mean what do i add  matt his dexterity modifier  laura yeah okay six  marisha total  taliesin really  travis it was a six  laura he gets no pluses  matt nope hes not very stealthy that bear  laura no hes a bear in armor no six  matt oh it was a six i thought you were joking all right trinket squishy footsteps you can  hear the impact coming as each footfall hits the sludge as you get closer towards it keeping at  bay as best out 
none	 of sight as possible you see the tree while it is thicker it is not as high as  the other trees in fact where there would be a top of a tree it looks to be instead a tangled  mass of branches that have been matted over and tied down to the top of where this tree ends  laura i tell him to stop  matt trinket stops you get a glance and the small glow is apparently a porthole or a window  that is carved circular out from one side of the trunk of this 
none	 tree the glow is a dull  reddishorange and its flickering  like firelight  travis its the keebler elves kill them all  laura i call him back i feel like thats animals thats not the tree were looking for  marisha this is not the tree were looking for  matt trinket backs up towards you  laura come back in  matt squish grunts dives into the necklace  marisha the whole time us who were waiting have been dosidoing around each other we dont stop  moving so were dancing in circles  matt its like 
none	 youre lagging  all right what are you doing vex  laura so its a tree that looks like theres people living in it its a window looking out  matt it seems to have an interior and some sort of warm firelight from the inside  laura thats definitely a fairy tree im going to stay clear im going to go back im going to  go back to the party and tell them what i see  matt all right vex returns from out of  the shadows of the forest no trinket in tow  laura trinket 
none	 died  sam oh my god  laura youre a dick im joking i think its fairies i think we should probably stay clear it  looked like there were things living in the tree it doesnt look like the cancerous tree  taliesin they may know  where we want to go though  marisha the pixies and fairies  havent been that nice  taliesin im not saying theyre nice im saying that maybe we need some new guidance  travis yeah look maybe  if you let me talk to them  laura how about no diplomacy 
none	 from you  maybe scanlan should go talk to them  sam i could talk to them but i want to know what they are first we should do some recon and at  least see what kind of creature they are i cant just knock on a door what if its a crazy monster  that pops its head out  travis then it eats you  taliesin well shoot you first  you wont feel anything  sam ill go up and talk but arent you curious  taliesin no not really  travis ive got your back 
none	 ill go with you  laura no  travis why  taliesin well send trinket too so either way you feel like youve accomplished something  youll both die and then youll know  that the bear goes with you  marisha its a bonding trip  ashley do you want me  to stay with you on the broom  sam yes  laura oh wait youre taking the broom  laughter  sam do you care more about the broom than me  taliesin dont answer that  sam youve known me for years  you just met 
none	 the broom  ashley maybe we can land there  and then we can send the broom back to you  sam no i need the broom to get away  taliesin thats a fair point  travis in order to stay alive  you need to be near the broom  taliesin well keep an eye out vex itll be fine  travis yeah the two gnomes go  theyre not very intimidating  laura i do not like this plan at all  taliesin you are charming youre both very charming so be charming  ashley im not 
none	 that charming  taliesin youre extremely charming  marisha i think you find her charming  taliesin she is charming  marisha i find her charming too but it doesnt mean that other people might  sam what could possibly go wrong  laura can i go on the broom with you scanlan  travis no let the little bits go  marisha were still doing a dosido by the way while were having this conversation  travis little bits go  sam all right pikey lets go knock on the door and get killed  laura if you fucking 
none	 get my broom lost because you told me not to go im going to murder you  and this is not in character  this is me telling you that  travis i just want to say that was a death threat in front of a thousand people  laughter  taliesin i think with this many witnesses  its not a threat its a promise  marisha is there a nearby tree  that i can climb into  matt there are a number of trees in the vicinity yes where this thing is though there is about a 
none	  30foot distance between it and any other trees its in the center of a small clearing  taliesin i want a good vantage  marisha yeah i get into a vantage point i get up into a tree and while they go do their recon  i want to cast commune with nature  matt all right so as you ascend the side of the nearest tree and it resembles atreyu climbing up  the tree in the swamp of sadness as its these large gnarled branches and bits of muck and dust  falling off the sides and 
none	 the oil slick that is surrounding the base makes it difficult to find  your handholds but you do eventually get your way up into the tree over the next five to ten  minutes you were going to cast commune with nature you said  marisha yes  matt all right what do you want to ask  marisha do i sense a cancerous tree  in the area  matt youre asking this of the tree  or is this the land around you right  marisha yeah im not asking the tree  matt you concentrate for 
none	 a second you feel yourself link with the land and its a very  jarring sensation youre used to connecting with nature being this serene wonderful experience  this is like plugging into a nightmare suddenly your thought process is filled with this  everdrawn sense of dread you feel this cold sensation fill your form and you manage to get  this information across but it leaves this very hollow feeling in the center of your being  feeling out you do not sense a cancerous tree but you do sense the strengthening presence  of the source of 
none	 this entire swamps perpetual destitution and slow decay  further to the northwest of this  marisha northwest okay so i can safely assume that the tree that theyre heading towards  is not cancerous  matt correct  laura so we should call them back  marisha im meditating then can i get a general lay of the land and sense running water  and rivers so we can avoid those  matt okay in feeling any source of bodies of water youre too far from the gilded run to sense  any of that and there is no 
none	 running water within the actual shademirk everything is a very  slowrolling sludge from the direction that you initially sensed its this perpetual billowing of  slow crawling death what little bit of running water you would sense is deep underground  and probably still in danger over the next  50 years or so of being corrupted itself  marisha oh okay for my last question  can i get a sense on any big evil things  that might want to kill us  matt you need to be a little more specific  than that  laughter 
none	  marisha everything more specific that i wont screw it up are there twinkies are there any  more large crocodile dudes living under the i dont know any more large things  living under the swamp  matt so you do a sense for large dangerous plant life entities like that crocodile  marisha yes under the swamp well wherever just blanket it  matt as you extend your presence you get no images or any sense of creatures like that  crocodile however you do sense a rather intense presence throughout this bog at certain places  of 
none	 other corrupted plant life entities  marisha does the tree in front of us count as a corrupted plant life entity and none of the  pixies that live in there are showing up on my radar as bad  matt no thats your final question the spell fades you climb your way back down  out of the branches of the tree  marisha this place sucks  laura what did you see  marisha its so sad the trees are so sad  laura anything useful  travis theyre sad or theyre angry also  marisha a little 
none	 bit of both  laura should we call the gnomes back  marisha theyre fine  laughter  marisha the presence of the distortion and the corruption is getting stronger northeast  travis then we should all go we shouldnt just send the little bits in there we should all go  laura i dont want to fight anymore before we get to whatever it is that were getting to  travis all right  matt have the gnomes already been set on their path at this time  sam were already cruising  matt yep so as you guys 
none	 are having this discussion the broom slowly glides up to the  outside of this tree as you get close to it you notice too from your immediate position that  mass of dried roots and branches that are up top are threaded together with rope there is  definitely construction to this almost like a wooden thatched roof the side porthole you see  does have a wooden crossbeam in the center it is definitely a functional and pretty wellcrafted  window for this rather rough exterior the roots of the tree though it is not very tall it 
none	 is  thick it is round its probably a good 25 30 feet wide this trees trunk and the roots are  large and sink deep into the ground in the vicinity you see the glow from the window  what do you want to do  laura dont do it  sam what who said that what  travis attack the tree  sam im getting mixed messages  ashley scanlan im a little nervous about  these ropes what if theyre trying  to catch us or something  taliesin how many windows are there  matt one 
none	 from what you can see  taliesin just one window  laura dont do it  sam youre not there  marisha i think vex might be right  laura come back  sam come back should we do a fly by the window to see whats inside  laura dont even fly close to the tree i have really bad feelings about this  sam fly by the window and peek in  laura fucking shit mother bitch  matt what do you do  sam using our expert flying skills were going to fly by the window and 
none	 do one of these and  check out the berenstain bears and then run  matt okay make a perception check  sam not good eight  ashley wait okay i think i just have so much mud in my eye i dont see anything  matt okay you dont pick up a lot of detail but as you come up over the top looking on the  inside it looks to be rather comfortable surprisingly its a small home theres a table  and theres a small hearth there appears to be what looks to be a shelf of 
none	 some kind ramshackle  maybe but still functional with books pressed into it you can see a number of small baskets  hanging from the ceiling containing various roots and other pieces of plant matter that are gathered  and bundled together you can see there is a fireplace by the hearth there is also a series of  drying animal carcasses hung in the corner that are all stripped and theyre being aired out in  that space you also see what looks to be a large chair that is facing the hearth slightly away  from you and 
none	 a small end table next to it that contains a little teacup and a little tea set  sam they look nice  taliesin what size person is the chair for  sam small  matt actually the chair is pretty large its tall the tea set is small and as youre making a  look you see one large crooked hand reach out from behind the chair with impossibly long fingers  with hooked nails reach over you can see what looks like dried wrappings hanging from parts of  its wrist and elbow as it reaches over and 
none	 wraps its gnarled fingers around this tiny teacup and  pull it back behind the chair  taliesin do you describe this  sam i dont i see it and i turn around  and i say pike lets get out of here  matt at this point you hear a snap sound and next to you you hear this creak as a little bit  of light peeks out to your left a door has slowly opened on the side of the tree trunk  ashley guys guys  laura please fly fucking back right now please  ashley 
none	 what do you want to do scanlan  sam we bolt we bolt for it  ashley hacking spit  sam hacking spit and start flying  matt flying where  sam back to our friends  matt okay you guys turn and begin making your way back towards the party and the broom slows  ashley oh no  laughter  laura how far away is it  matt it comes to a stop and then drops out from under you both squish into the sludge  ashley okay thats okay  sam i grab pike and we both 
none	 go invisible  ashley i pick up the broom before we go invisible  matt all right and youre casting invisibility  sam invisibility i guess at one level higher right is that what i do  matt i believe thats what you do to get more of that making sure real fast  so we dont mess this up  sam level three invisibility  taliesin her house is going to have  chicken feet  laughter  matt you both turn invisible her clutching the broom  ashley what  matt youre both invisible now youre clutching the 
none	 broom  ashley were invisible and the broom is invisible  matt yeah  laura i go surprised shriek  sam we start tiptoeing out i suppose  matt you watch them vanish ahead of you a few moments pass and you guys end up making your way  back to the group and you see the squish footfalls of both of your tiny gnome friends  taliesin i am watching that hag through my scope with everything ive got  matt from your perspective you cant really see anything through the window youre just going off  of what 
none	 theyve told you which has been very little youre looking into the side of the  window and all you see is a little bit of flicker of firelight thats it  ashley i go up to vex and i give her her broom  laura relieved noises  cheering  travis what did you find oh  whispering what did you find  ashley theres a woman it looked like it was really nice and then there was this really cute  tea set and then this crazy hand came out  travis that sounds terrible  ashley she 
none	 looks really scary  marisha was she really tall  do you know if she was tall  ashley the chair was really big  i mean anybodys tall to us  marisha that is true  ashley yeah she was very large  travis super important question  did they see you  ashley i think probably  sam well the broom stopped flying  laura what do you mean  taliesin run  laura what  travis are you saying we should hide percy  taliesin we should go  travis where  matt clutching the broom in 
none	 your hands as you emit the phrase that youve known to bring it to  vibrant magical life  groaning  marisha oh no  laughter  matt the broom jumps to life  cheering and laughter  laura thank you matt for saving a marriage  ashley oh my god  matt and there backing up from this abode in the center of the shademirk bog your broom retrieved  your party members gathered looking towards that glowing window and now the ajar door inviting you  in to some degree well pick this up next session  cheering
