none	 we left off the mighty nein had  completed their first of two ventures they agreed to complete in the name of the gentleman heading  northward towards berleben traversing the dangerous labenda swamp freeing the once  endangered safe house from the encroaching merrow dangers that had destroyed and decimated the  people that were working there at the time and freeing it up for future use you had acquired a  bird friend in the tiny kiri that is along with you dagger in hand  travis six hit points  matt yeah thats fine youll be fine 
town	  marisha shes going to die  matt you gathered your things and went back to the open road where you headed to the crossroads  did some trading through the evening jumped into a few old friends who were looking to rob you  sent them on their way then continued northward until eventually you came upon the outskirts of  the what was it silberquel ridge there we go brain not working to the gnomish city of  hupperdook upon arriving in the city you took in the industrial sites the elements of it that are  heavy 
town	 machinery and the creation of new types of clockworkbased technologies the stacks of soot  and steam sent outward the war machines being developed for use to the eastern lines where the  conflict with xhorhas is now brewing you made a friend by the name of rissa who said in exchange  for a round drinks in the evening would show you around the town for a bit upon making your way to  the upper level you were given a brief tour of the vicinity which seemed strangely empty the  streets very well decorated for some seeming 
town	 celebration but nobody present as the sun slowly  went down the town came to life as all the work whistles blew the sounds of merriment began and  suddenly as the sun goes vanishing behind the distant mountains the golds and oranges and  subtle purples of the sunset begin to take over the sound of music and laughter begins to take the  streets so mighty nein what would you like to do  travis laughter and music i dont trust laughter and music  sam were we on our way to something were we going to some 
tavern	 place  laura the blushing tankard is that where we were going  sam blushing tankard is that a place to stay  laura it was a tavern rissa  matt right yeah  laura theres a big party happening now  matt like i said welcome to hupperdook  laura wha should we should we party  matt well i mean what else is there to do for the night here but that  sam we dont know we just got here  matt theres nothing else to do youve arrived go and get your stuff somewhere and lets

none	  hands and she reaches out and plucks them from their hand and picks it up its all popping  around and she passes it over  sam ooh what yelling and blowing  laura no its cool  sam oh are you drawing something its a dick  laura gasping  sam i knew it  laura i was going to write dick  sam oh you didnt even need to  laura i didnt  matt i can already see im going to like you folks  travis wow work hard play hard  matt thats the way 
town	 we do here  laura i like this town  travis should we drop our shit off and  sam where are we dropping can we stay at this place as well or do we  matt you can  sam give me that i want to smell it  travis quick question this blushing tankard tavern the doors lock right theres privacy  its not like some fucking freeforall all night is it  matt well in the tavern  travis upstairs in the rooms i assume they have  matt oh you can lock the doors  travis 
tavern	 im just asking i dont know could be free love and a bunch of crazy people roaming  around i dont know  marisha it is called the blushing tankard  travis right  marisha why is it blushing  matt because you put your lips to it  travis oh shit  laura because why  sam because you put your lips to it  laura oh  travis yeah were in for a fucki okay  laura lead the way  marisha do i see anyone selling glow sticks  matt make a perception check  marisha light 
none	 up swords  travis fiber optic whips  marisha i want a fiber optic whip  matt candy necklaces big giant pacifiers  marisha thats not great nine  matt what you see is waves of fast moving families and people gnomish some dwarves a few  humansized folks rushing by it looks like some of them are rushing from work to get home to  disrobe from all their dirty clothes and jump back out with their party attire or theyre already on  their way to wherever their destination is you hear fireworks going off in the distance 
none	 and the  occasional flashes in the sky but you dont see any vendors at this juncture at this point whos  helming the cart and the horses  laura fjord  travis i am  matt okay rissa saddles up sits right in the little bench next to you at the front of the cart  and takes part of the reins helping to guide you to where youre trying to get to go follow me  tug to the right and its got about two blocks down that way its going to be hard to miss look  
none	 for the large arch with the various spiraling ivy vines against it  travis very nice of you can i keep an eye on her hands just to make sure shes not going through my  pockets while shes up here  matt yeah make a perception check  travis 15  matt during this travel as youre keeping an eye out she seems to be just focused on the task at hand  travis i feel a little guilty but not much  laura that means that her sleight of hand is better than your perception thats all it 
none	 means  matt thats what it could mean or she could just not be trying to steal from you but it could be  either you dont know after pulling around the side you come to this large celebration square  where there are three stages set up there is a large maypole in the center and theyre currently  lifting up and tethering these large colorful streamers of multiple colors people are gathering  baskets of flowers a few get tossed and you catch it and theyre made of cloth you get the sense  here that they dont 
none	 have access to a lot of fresh flowers here in hupperdook based on the rocky  terrain and the perpetual tossing of soot and ash into the atmosphere also if the celebration is  that often they probably continue to reuse the same elements over and over again as you come  over into this corner there are bands starting to play music being set up on the outside people  are starting to sit down with blankets and families are starting to gather in this area to  your left you see the large ivory archway with the ivy 
tavern	 thats twisting across the top of it  rissa reaches and tugs your hands to the left to gear the cart in that direction and goes all  right blushing tankard right up this way theres more laughter and there are two vendors  now on the outside one of which is currently selling flower necklaces or bands the other has  clusters of sparklers and firecrackers  travis theres some of them now am i stopping  marisha just keep it going im just going to and i just roll off  taliesin ill follow  laura beau get 
none	 me some too beau get me some too  marisha okay i go up to the sparklers and firecrackers  matt you walk up and theres a young gnomish man in what would be the equivalent of his late teens  or early twenties got a very prominent adams apple and very thin for some of the gnomes youve  seen around there he glances up to you holding a small barrel filled with various smallscale  explosives hi can i help you  marisha i want three of everything  matt three all right ill just get this together 
none	  marisha how much comes in a pack  matt well do you want three of everything or do you want a pack  marisha they come in packs  travis were going to lose a finger before the nights done  sam did you just change your shirt travis  travis yeah bitch  sam how did that happen  travis hocus pocus motherfucker  sam sorry focus  matt packs of ten  marisha ten ten sparklers or ten poppers  matt packs for both of ten  marisha yeah i want one of each pack of each 
none	  matt all right pack of each that will be five silver  marisha okay thank you  travis i slow down just a little bit and give her time  sam i dont think shes coming  marisha then i also get a flower necklace for jester  matt oh thats on the other side the next person over there a portlylooking fellow in his  middle ages or so resting inside of his neck rescinded inside hi yeah the flowers are going  to run about five copper per string so do you want just one  marisha 
none	 ill ah  travis bring him with us  matt hes got a bunch of them tied up in his hair and hanging off his neck  marisha do you also do braids  matt braids are across the way over there cindy does the braids  marisha ill just take one  matt all right thats five copper thank you  travis please tell me he has a shortsword and can fight  matt youre going to keep collecting pathetic characters to fight with you  travis yes please bring kiri and that guy ill be happy every fight 
none	  matt its the best front line you can hope for  marisha i catch up and i give jester the flower necklace  travis as she starts to roll up i go hyah and just take off  marisha grunting  laura oh no im get grunting is that for me beau its beautiful  marisha it looked like you im sorry if it smells weird  laura wait i guess itd have to be like this its beautiful  marisha i take out one of the poppers and i throw it on the ground what happens  matt 
none	 bouncing  marisha shit i jump out and i go pick it up its too valuable i run back  matt you go back and look at it and you realize there is actually a tiny little fuse on it  marisha oh theres a process okay i jump back on caleb light it  liam no you throw it  marisha okay oh like skeet shooting  liam yeah throw it in the air  marisha okay whoosh  liam fire bolt  matt roll for an attack  sam fire bolt  travis it incinerates the fiber  
none	 liam pretty good thats 19 plus something  matt you dont even have to roll damage she tosses it in the air and it arcs this tiny little  firecracker this little gray rod and then this little streak of flame fires up and hits it it  detonates with this loud pop sound and you see sparks around it it dissipates a moment after and  in the vicinity about seven or eight nearby gnomes two of which children all go gasp  yeah start clapping and cheering  marisha you see that im their hero  liam how 
none	 did you do it  travis yeah different fingers but sure i like it  marisha this is amazing these could be useful  liam for shits and giggles or what do you have in mind  marisha for distractions we could do that again and like when were fighting people  travis diversions  marisha yeah  liam sure it went very good in the swamp with that little one  sam well can i have one to examine  travis say no  sam you have a bunch of them  marisha how many is in a pack 
town	  matt ten so you have nine now  marisha i might have to get more before we leave this town  laura i think thats smart  sam matt how much do we know about black powder  matt well communally not much at all you make an intelligence check and have advantage because  of your alchemical history  sam okay ill take the first roll intelligence  matt yes  sam 18  matt you know its had minor applications for a while but its only really been applied in very  condensed and common use for 
dung	 like the explosives you found in the mine clearing out spaces in  underground caverns or for the detonation of localized rocks that are in the way of paths  trying to be put in mountain ranges small scale black powder like this you havent encountered  really so this seems to be a relatively new use of this particular compound  sam up to this point its been rare that i or weve come across anything  matt youve barely come across it at all youve read about it actually the dynamite sticks you  found in the mine 
town	 were probably the first ones you encountered in your experience not a lot of use  for it in the small farming town of felderwin  laura would i have seen fireworks before in nicodranas  matt you have before but theyre saved for very rare occasions like the coming of a ship thats  been long gone from shore or particular times of the year for celebrations they would go off and  for that in particular they would put ship barges out on the water and they would fire them up from  the waterfront having it this 
tavern	 close is intense and even that small burst right there there was a  flash of heat that you havent really had before and its really exciting  liam are we just in an ocean of gnomes is it like 98 gnomes all around us  matt most everyone you see here is gnomish youve seen a handful of dwarves thats the next  prominent people that live here and then a smattering of human and halfelf right now you  guys have just come to the outside of the blushing tankard  liam im traveling with my hood up 
none	 minor detail as you were  laura lets go inside  travis yeah were here is there a hitching post in the front  matt there is  travis yeah hitch up the horses  matt okay  laura you think its safe i dont think its safe  travis they seem real joviallike  liam when people have libations they get up to hijinks at night and that seems like the main activity here  travis you want to go in and secure us some rooms and ill watch the carriage figure out if  theres somewhere else we 
none	 need to keep it  liam i pull out the silver thread and i start going around the horses  travis oh or that  laura hey nott have you ever been dancing before  sam have i ever been dancing before like to a place like this  laura yeah  sam ive danced  laura okay just making sure  sam why are we dancing  laura i figure were going to dance tonight  taliesin probably inevitably  sam all right i might need some liquor  matt you guys leaving caleb and youre staying with caleb 
tavern	 while he sets up the perimeter  travis yeah while he does the string  sam do we need to choreograph something  laura gasps we probably should we should probably get kiri involved  sam that sounds adorable  laura come on kiri  taliesin definitely going to need a drink for this  travis were going to lose her tonight  matt as you guys enter the blushing tankard tavern it is one of the larger taverns youve  been in the floor space has 20 or so round tables scattered amongst the floor there is a stage 
tavern	 in  the far back where the music hasnt quite started yet but there are musicians setting up you can  see a violinist whos currently tuning there is a piano in the back and outside a couple of taverns  you saw in zadash and your experiences from when you were on the coast pianos arent as common in  tavern spaces usually reserved for the upper class for private performances or higherend  social events however the tables are filling up already people are rushing in there food is  passed around left and right in the back 
none	 theres a group of gnomes that are currently clapping the  ground on their table singing some sort of tune a shanty one of them is up on the table clapping  his legs there one of the barmaids comes by and slaps him get off the table  laura this place is great  sam its really nice  matt what would you guys like to do  marisha try to get some rooms  taliesin lets get some rooms and stow our stuff and get out there  laura i want to go try to play the piano 
none	  matt all right  sam right away  laura yes  sam do you play the piano  laura ive played it a little bit at home  liam i want to listen im going to sit close by  marisha molly and i will go  laura i have a lot of really good songs that i learned when i was growing up im going to sit  down and try to play chopsticks  matt okay go ahead and make a performance check  laura oh yeah its an eight  matt and laura poorly playing chopsticks 
none	  matt theres a few moments of this going on before you suddenly hear this throat clearing  you turn over your left shoulder and there is a halfelven gentlemen in a very nice  doublet who is currently holding a handful of sheet music um youre at my piano  laura poorly playing chopsticks  matt he twitches at the offtune hammering of the keys ill be right back he turns around and  wanders off for the moment clearing his ear with his pinky you guys go to get rooms  taliesin yeah  matt you head to 
tavern	 the front its a very long bar that wraps around the right side of the entire  chamber it has two hatches that can open up from the inside you see two individuals you see a  male gnome with a massive mane of red hair clean shaven middle age and hes smiling and running  around getting drinks sliding them down the bar filling things hes the gnomish redhead  equivalent of tom cruise spinning the bottles and pouring them out on the other side you see a  female dwarf with this awesome wellkept chinstrap beard who has 
none	 beautiful eye makeup on  and this very colorful silk billowing blouse that tapers at the wrist with a flourish shes  currently filling out drink and snack orders and theyre both workhorses they both have smiles on  their faces and theyre chatting with regulars you havent quite caught their eye yet theyre in  the midst of other business  laura did you say she was a dwarf  matt a dwarf yeah  marisha who do we talk to do we talk to the gnome or the dwarf  taliesin whichever one we catch the eye of 
tavern	 first  marisha yeah we should do the bar lean in thing  taliesin all right im in  marisha shove some other people around do that thing  matt for the hell of it both of you guys roll charisma checks please  taliesin oh this is going to be funny  marisha something were great at just straight checks  matt just roll a d20 and add your charisma modifier  travis that dice just is the biggest tease  taliesin want to go at the same time  marisha it rocks back and forth okay  taliesin 
none	 three two one six  marisha eight  matt so the better part of 15 minutes pass of you guys waiting there and being overlooked until  eventually the dwarf woman stops and goes all right sorry about that didnt see you there  youre a bit higher than the usual folk what can i do for you  marisha that seems oddly backwards we need a couple of rooms a few rooms a handful of rooms  and some drinks  matt both of those can be done lassie  marisha how many rooms do we need three four 
tavern	  taliesin counting  marisha and taliesin four  matt four rooms all right lets see then thats one gold piece per room per night  taliesin i just put down four gold pieces  marisha does it come with amenities does it have a mini bar do you charge  matt this is the mini bar my dear but dont worry we can bring drinks up we can bring  companions up we can bring what you need up just let us know  taliesin youre in a tourist town things are going to cost something  marisha all 
tavern	 right  liam on the other side of the bar i cast haste on jester while she is playing the piano  laura i want to start playing the entertainer  matt all right  sam playing the entertainer  matt but really fast  sam and laura speedily playing the entertainer  matt its impressive a little offkey but overall impressive the speed of the composition  right as she starts crescendoing about to get to the quiet part speedily playing the entertainer  a hand slams down on the keys and that same halfelven gentlemen leans in once 
none	 more and goes  if i might please request my instrument returned to me my dear  laura this is a really good piano  matt thank you  laura you should be really proud its yours  matt i am  laura do you have a tip jar  matt i have a tipping hat he pulls off from the side this widebrimmed hat that comes to a  point in the front and floppy in the back and he sets it up on top of the piano  laura i really think the first couple tips should be 
none	 to me because i really set up the room for you  matt well then i certainly hope the first few tips come while youre at the bench  laura fabulous  matt and he sits down at the bench and pushes you off of it  liam i toss one gold in and say this ones for the lady very good  laura did you see  matt i saw cracks his knuckles sets his music down in front starts getting ready the other  performers to the side are watching this out of the corner of their eye 
none	 and laughing theyre  enjoying the tension thats brewing  laura i run over and give caleb a kiss on the cheek thank you caleb  matt you guys get your rooms situated as the keys are being passed out to the different rooms  drinks are being handled so are you looking for something strong or something strong  taliesin amaze me baffle me make me forget where i am  matt she leans into you and goes i like you youre colorful  taliesin bless you youre colorful yourself i love everything youre wearing  matt thank you 
none	 first ones on me how about that  taliesin bless you ill happily pay for hers as well because i want to drink her under the fucking table  matt hold that till later on that events not till later tonight  taliesin what happens later tonight other than more drink  matt is this your first time here  taliesin are we that obvious  matt a bit well we have some performances going on and then we have our contest our weekly  hour of honor so just dont drink too much if youre looking to compete she 
dung	 pops the top  button off the top of her blouse and gives a better look at her dwarven cleavage  laura i love that you did it  taliesin brava  matt i realized that i could do it as i was doing it as she does that she reaches down and pulls  out a dark red glass bottle with a large cap which she pulls off this tiny glass passes it  over to you and you look at it youre used to seeing liquid splash quite often this sloshes at  a slower pace its a 
none	 thicker liquor  taliesin i dip a finger  matt its surprisingly sweet strong the burn kicks in afterward you like it  taliesin shoot or sip  matt thats up to you  marisha sorry to interrupt your incessant flirting can i please have a damn drink  matt would you like one of the same  marisha yes one of the same yes  matt all right thatll be five silver pieces  marisha i thought he paid for me i thought you paid for me  taliesin i am paying for you i just put a gold 
none	 down keep the tip as well  matt oh my goodness thank you she puts it in her cleavage pours you another shot of it as  well hands it over  marisha i just kill the whole thing  matt all right it burns but its good its like a sweet thick honey liquor that coats the  throat and the coating at first feels nice until the burn hits  marisha its kind of medicinal  taliesin challenge accepted satisfied grunt  matt its good  travis caleb and i have come in at this point and i 
none	 turn to caleb and go i feel like i may be  regretting my roommate choice tonight its just a hunch i think hes in his element  liam well the odds are that you are not going to even see him in your room tonight so i wouldnt  worry about it so much  travis you think hell just like tear into the night and maybe not come back until the sun comes up  liam hes like a coyote you know what that is  travis yeah its like  liam funny accent diplomatic immunity  laughter 
none	  sam funny accent i dont know what that means  laughter  taliesin wow okay  travis i do  liam yeah they like to fuck a lot is my point  travis i thought those were rabbits  marisha i thought so too  travis were going to have to work on our analogies i feel like there is something missing  here yeah okay a bunny coyote  marisha that sounds cute  travis it does sound cute  liam but if you want a quieter evening you can certainly share the room with nott and i 
none	 for once  its probably not as raucous a room but youre welcome to it  travis yeah just in case he goes full monty i might have like a secret knock or something  laura where did yasha go  matt yasha is with you but the players in japan filming as you glance around yashas  sitting towards the back and towering over most of the clientele here and not necessarily  uncomfortable but unsure what to make of the jovial atmosphere there is the faint corner of a  smile but the awkward anxious smile of not 
none	 knowing what to do and afraid to step any  direction and crush somebody  travis yeah  taliesin shes turning on the charm  travis fair enough i appreciate that  laura there are four rooms  marisha i really like it when she crosses her arms like that it makes her biceps look good  laura so molly can have a room all to his own if he really wants to you know clicking whistle  travis oh  taliesin oh are we talking about that im not going to invade your space if you dont need it 
none	  dont worry about it  travis no i mean half of mes interested the other halfs terrified so im just kind of curious  taliesin and if you drink enough you wont remember either way  travis yeah  matt at this point rissas like well if youve got your rooms taken care of were looking  for a place to sit then she glances past and you can see patrons are starting to get really  rowdy they have these ropehung chandeliers in three different spots and you can see one person  is jumped up onto one 
tavern	 and is hanging back and forth off of it some people are like yeah all  of a sudden the dwarf woman at the bar goes oh for the love of clambers over with a speed you  didnt expect from her rushes over and grabs the ankle and tears him down off onto the ground  not in my bar  marisha you know ive never seen anyone actually swing from a chandelier i just thought  it was a metaphor  taliesin no thats entirely something you can do its more common than youd think  laura is 
town	 it allowed in other bars  matt are you talking to rissa i imagine if theyre not paying attention  taliesin there was some pub i dont remember what town i was in but i do remember the pub  because it was actually called the swinging chandelier i dont remember what town it was  though but it was a great pub it had the best chandelier  matt my gnomish eyes spot what looks to be one open table across the way right there rissa  points and you can see past the way theres one table that 
none	 two people are just getting up from and leaving  sam i will dart at full speed full dash to get that table  matt you and rissa go into a full run you beating her easily you get to the table and scoot  into the side as she approaches you watch as two male gnomes intercept her and block her path one  of them goes uhuh sorry tinkertop tables not for you she goes fuck off fitz ive worked  hard enough i saw this table fair and square the other one goes you dont work tabletop 
none	  just like your brainsick dad this tables for working folk fitz glances over and says go ask  your pops to make you a table to drink at alone might buy you an hour before it breaks  taliesin im going to walk right into the middle of this gentle persons are you harassing our  employee right now  matt they both look wildly confused no no  taliesin we have employed the services of this person right here and i would agree that you  should probably leave right now and get another table for yourselves  
none	 matt make an intimidation check  taliesin nope thats a four  matt as you lean forward in that tense glare a little bit of a liquorbased burp comes up  abruptly and breaks the intensity of the moment oh someones starting early not too bad no  from what ive heard about these folks their bloods fire but on the inside theyre nothing  but cold and clammy he goes and flicks the edge of your nose these two little gnomish punks  taliesin demonic voice  laura i use my tail to  taliesin if you want to 
none	 go too at the same time i say a little bit of infernal and im  going to use a blood maledict and make him go blind for a second  laura i was going to smack him on the ass with my tail at the same time  matt all right which one  laura ill do the other one  taliesin the one on the left for me  matt the one that just flicked you in the nose his eyes go black and you can see the bit of  crimson pooling at the corner of the 
none	 eyes he goes stuttering stumbles back and hits the  stool and falls onto his ass whats going on  sam im going to jump on top of him and start rifling through his pockets  taliesin thank you i was hoping for it  matt go ahead and make a sleight of hand check  travis the table sam the table  sam 23 no 27  matt you manage to pull six silver pieces and three gold pieces out of his pocket  sam anything other than money  matt right now no strangely enough its only money 
none	 and only that amount  liam im watching nott and as soon as i see that she has found everything that she is looking for  ive got the copper wire ready and i mutter through it to the one on the ground theyre  going to kill you you have to run now  matt the one that gets slapped in the ass by jester is like stuttering i apologize rissa  we didnt know reaches over and goes and grabs the friend as soon as nott jumps on and starts  thrashing around on him get that thing 
town	 goes and pushes you off of its body picks up the other  gnome at this point his eyes come back and the little strings of blood are curling down the side  of his cheek he goes what happened  taliesin some people cant hold their liquor its really embarrassing  laura its sad really  matt they both just get lost into the crowd  laura no stay play with us longer  matt rissa looks over her shoulder at them leave and laughing  travis wow that took a turn fast  taliesin i like the way 
none	 that worked out  matt me too indeed  sam who were they  matt fitz and ashton theyre both a couple of punks ive known them since i was a kid  travis they called you tabletop  matt well tinkertop  travis tinkertop  taliesin both equally mysterious  laura wait so your dad is what rich or something  matt eh  laura its nothing to be ashamed of its okay if he is  matt she curls into the bench around the table and leans one shoulder onto it my fathers an  inventor a tinkerer 
none	 of some renown at one time hes had a rough few years  travis he said he was brainsick  matt thats just him being an arsehole  laura what kind of stuff does he make  matt all sorts of things toys contraptions occasionally whatever hes told to make by the  starosta but hes just a bumbling twat really  laura can we meet him  matt hes probably in nap time right now tomorrow maybe  laura okay  marisha i bring over a round of drinks for everybody  matt another round of just traditional ale 
none	 drinks for everybody would probably run you well say  three silver pieces as you guys gather around for a second rissa livens up a bit after that  conversation but anyway youve asked me a bit about myself what about you what are you here  for what brings you to this godforsaken place  travis were actually here for a spot of work  matt looking for work  laura yes of course work thats what were doing  sam not looking for work were just on a job  travis i said for a spot of work 
none	  sam yeah  laura oh yes  liam honestly the name really sells this place we have been fascinated with it for quite some time  matt thats not the first time weve heard that  laura i was really hoping you would have houses of mushrooms do you have any  matt im just going to call that unintentional ignorance but no gnomes dont live in  mushrooms dont be saying that around here very loudly not all folks will be taking kindly to that  liam shes set in her ways  laura no i just thought 
town	 hupperdook sounded like a mushroom sort of town  travis didnt she just say not to  laura im going to stop though  sam they prefer the term toadstools  marisha i somehow feel like thats worse  matt she grabs one of the tankards and starts drinking heavily from it anyway the music  begins to kick in even louder the celebration has kicked into a second gear here once i can find  the music transition  marisha and travis heavy metal guitar melodies  taliesin oh so its the noise room heavy bass thudding  matt 
town	 the crowd begins to hush for a moment from one of the back rooms a door opens and a range of  brightlycolored gnome dancers come rushing into the room to a swell of cheers and applause you  see four dancers emerge across the spectrum of gender and take to tabletops and begin to stomp  and click their feet to the rhythm of the music the musicians begin to finally pick up and build  the pianist you met earlier is starting to make his music happen its beautiful and echoes  through the room the placement of 
none	 it you get the sense now whether it be some enchantment or some  intentional acoustic presence in the room but the music carries well and seems to bleed from  everywhere as the dancers are up on the tables these silk scarves rainbowcolored from their  arms twirl into large circles and shapes and they have this worked out fantastic choreography  in unison they begin to leap from tabletop to tabletop in a circular fashion making these large  arching foot leaps and landing again folks cheer with each land the music whirring itself into a  frenzy 
none	 folks are starting to toss coins towards them on the table they in the middle of it will  spin catch one and pocket it and move back into the dance you get the sense this a very practiced  and fairly often performed as to how welloiled this machine of a performance is  liam they are almost as nimble as you  marisha what  laura i toss a silver  matt snatched out of the air  taliesin i toss two at the same time  marisha i see if i catch one missile snare im going 
dung	 to try to catch one of mollys coins  travis did you just take a dancers tip  matt make a dexterity check this is going to be a contested dexterity check between you and a dancer  taliesin yeah im into it especially if it fails please  marisha natural one  taliesin yeah  travis thats justice  marisha it is  matt as you reach for the coin your fingers almost touch it before everything goes dark as a  wooden shoecovered foot slamming across your face from the dancer who catches it between two  fingers 
tavern	 looks down retracts the foot and as you get your vision back and look up the dancer gives  you a wink and goes back into a spin  marisha i wink back you know i kind of liked that it was kind of hot  matt as the dancers begin to gather leaping from table to table they start getting closer to the  center of the room they begin to spin together until eventually they clasp hands some of the bar  hands grab the tables and start pushing them together in the center telling the patrons to 
none	  step back a bit as they do the circle continues to get tighter as they leap from table to table  holding each other wrist to wrist arm to arm as they do the silks are billowing out and you can  see them extending the silks theyve been holding seem to have been a bunch hidden within their  sleeves as they billow out they widen until its like a parachute of rainbow colors that just  spin in this circle it completely engulfs them all you see is the tip of their heads within this  swirl 
none	 of color until eventually the music comes to a climax and with a heavy stomp all the colors  fade and the dancers bow everyone in the room starts cheering and clapping  applause  travis hot damn  matt the dancers smile and step off walking around with hats in the front taking tips from  people at tables as they adjust the tables back to their original point everyone else goes back to  their meals and you see them tossing the odd copper or silver piece into their hats  sam i dont know if we can 
none	 learn that dance  laura i think we can do it  sam lets just work on something simple were going to take a moment to work out a couple of  moves in case it comes up just some basic hand moves  matt kiri is off to the side chirping  laura we can have her stand on one shoulder each  sam im much shorter than you  laura ill be on my knees then we can do these things kiri can have a ribbon and shell do this  while we do it  sam i 
dung	 like it  laura its basically the same as what they just did  sam caleb maybe can do some special effects  liam will it be dark where we are doing this i worry about you know what i worry about  sam maybe i should sit it out  liam no it just depends on the situation this happens all over the city outside everywhere ja  matt for the most part yeah as the evening goes on it tends to gather around the places where  drink is running freely until everyone passes out then wakes up 
none	 hair of the dog usually takes  himself a bit of fuse and then gets back to work  travis a bit of fuse  matt a fuse is the hair of the dog drink that we brew here to get everyone waking up and back to work  travis i know what mollyll be having in a couple hours  matt i dont know how its going to mingle well with nongnomish tracts but im willing to watch and try  taliesin im very excited to find out  matt me too laughs  travis rissa can i ask 
none	 you about the whats it called honor hour that comes up later  matt hour of honor  travis hour of honor yeah whats that about  matt look over there she points to the far wall and theyre starting to set up lights on it  these glowing lanterns they have on pikes its a collection of wooden name plates she goes once  a week theres a contest where the previous holders of the hour of honor can take challenges  whoever provides the most monetary amount to the challenge gets to go oneonone with their team  
tavern	 drink to drink until only ones left unpuking or unpassed out  sam a team drinking competition  matt the remainder gets the coin i think a percentage goes to the house and gets to take the  title and a token that token is worth a free drink to each member of that team in this bar  every night  laura every night  liam it is almost like a drunken crossfit gym im sorry it is almost like a crossfit gym  travis there you go  laura we should probably do that for this i would 
none	 make an exception  travis it could cost a lot of money  laura how much  travis well he said whoever contributes the most monetarily gets to take a shot at the honor  laura how much do people usually contribute  liam i have two gold  matt from what ive seen it can depend on if people are that interested or that competitive  some folks put up the few gold theyve earned for a few days if theyre feeling lucky ive seen  people put upwards of 20 25 gold sometimes which is quite a sizable 
none	 sum  laura are you a big drinker rissa  matt i can hold my weight but im not much of a competitor if thats what youre asking  travis is it happening relatively soon or do we have a few more hours to explore a bit i just  have the feeling if we were to engage that all activities after that would not be documented in  the ol brain so well  matt youve probably been here for the better part of an hour or two just getting your paces  having drinks and taking in the 
none	 performances and the music id say you probably have another hour  before it begins  taliesin want to do a little runaround  travis i figure if were going to do that  taliesin i think were going to do that  travis all right  marisha lets go whos going to put kiri either on their shoulders or we need to  travis to bed  laura we cant put her to bed  travis why not  laura because shell just come out of the room wont you kiri  sam why would she come out of 
none	 the room  taliesin because hupperdook  laura because theres so much noise and stuff  taliesin its family friendly  travis theres no dropoff daycare is there a daycare here rissa  matt like jester i am kiri  travis oh god  laura yes you are very sweet  matt like jester yes i am very sweet  liam perhaps our feathered friend is a little more important than the horses and i could leave  my threads around her room and she would be safe there i would know if there was a problem  matt like 
none	 caleb doesnt matter though  liam no but it does matter because you are a young child and you need to get your rest and we  are going to be doing things that are quite frankly not for your eyes  matt like jester okay  laura she would come out of the room i know her  matt like jester i know her  marisha what if we get her one of those child leashes  sam ooh they said that they would send someone to the room right molly  taliesin did they  sam didnt you 
none	 say that they would send someone to the room  liam we could get a babysitter  sam like a babysitter you could pay one of their women to watch our little kiri  taliesin i have done some ridiculous things in my life that might take the top of it though  sam theyre working women we rent them for a time  matt rissa at this point goes well first off youre assuming theyre all women  sam oh yeah thats true we could get a sturdy strapping gigolo man to go up there and  watch out 
tavern	 for kiri  laura i dont think thats a bad idea  travis rissa do you know how much one of these evening companions might run per hour  matt i can honestly say i do not sorry  travis should i go ask  sam yes  travis yes all right fine ill be right back ill make my way up to the bar to the one with the  taliesin ive got an idea ive got an idea there is one member of our party who is probably  not going to want to go out and see 
tavern	 this ridiculousness  sam she is a wallflower tonight  marisha she does seem very uncomfortable yeah  travis i still want to check the price so i go up to the bar  matt as you approach the bar the dwarven woman whos in the process of cleaning a spill on the  side looks over and sees you and does a tripletake like well would you look at this  strapping mass of green and tooth laughter  travis thank you kindly maam  matt what can i do for you  travis its a little early in 
none	 the evening but i thought i might get a head start and inquire what  some friendship might run me  matt mighty forward but i cant say im not interested ive got a few more hours on my shift  but if you hang around  travis i would hate to remove you from your duties plus my companions are also interested in  the same you said there might be  matt well its been a while since ive  travis oh no yeah let me clarify stammering i need  matt she goes and starts pouring herself 
none	 a drink  travis multiples not multiples i need individual companions for my friends not just  your beautiful self  matt how many  travis three  matt three companions all right i have to go and connect with a friend here and see whats  available but thats certainly doable  travis great and do you know how much that might run  matt well that depends on what youre asking for is it only for the hour is it for the  evening what the requests are  travis per hour is good yeah  matt for 
none	 an hour three thatd put you about say 20 gold  travis boy that sounds like a fun night outstanding i will be sure to return i turn my  head and leave  laura what did she say  travis that was the most horrible thing ive ever had to do im not prepared to talk to people  about those things  laura what did she say  travis its 20 gold for three people for an hour  laura thats it  sam three manhours  travis nope at one hour three people 20 gold so thats 
none	 yeah  liam are you all right  travis god its real uncomfortable  laura why do we need three people to watch kiri  travis look i was just making shit up on the fly all right  taliesin yasha i know youre not into this i know that you want to have a night out do you  just want to sit and keep the young one out of trouble  matt i can do that yeah shes small i can hold her down  taliesin its going to be fine thats a joke  liam are you

town	 marisha feels like you had to reach for that you stammered a little  laura plus you have already lots of scarves on you so you can do a lot of the things  the people were doing  travis you got scarves on you  marisha i do have a lot of scarves  liam no thats truthful its obvious how dexterous you are youre just gruff  laura yeah so should we dance in the street  sam we should rehearse we dont know when were going to need the dance yet  taliesin were going outside to 
none	 see what this place has to offer before its time for a drinking  contest that well  travis were going to need a beagle to lead the charge im assuming thats you  taliesin shouting onward and outward  travis jesus dog baying  matt as youre making your way out the dwarven lass reaches out in your direction fjord to flag you down  travis oh maam  matt so just asking how soon are you wanting this companionship sent to your rooms and and  her fingers playing with the front of your armor on the edge 
tavern	 of the bar and goes i could give  you a discount  travis stammering  laura you know heres the thing hes already been with the ruby of the sea so probably nothing  you do could compare to that kind of sad really  matt would you like me to cancel your request then  travis no no id like to put a deposit down i dont know when well be back maybe four gold to  hold the reservation  liam ask if theres a cancellation fee  travis no i cant im terrified  matt all 
none	 right ill hold on to this until then well hopefully see you around gives a hint of  grinning stinkeye in your direction jester and back to fjord take care of yourself lad  travis yeah okay  marisha did you just put a hooker on layaway  travis i think i did i feel like i did did you just say id been with your mom  laura i know as soon as i said it it was really creepy  travis yeah thats fucked up  laura but you know what it was just a power play and 
none	 it didnt really work out  marisha i will say normally being like you slept with my mom is an insult or something or  dont talk about my mom  laura yeah but people that have slept with my mom are really rich and really powerful usually  so its a compliment for them  liam also you have to embrace yes and fjord yes and not no but  sam this is good you have an opportunity for later if you choose to use it  laura yeah i could sit in the room and let you know

tavern	 like captain america not many  travis yep pretty close  taliesin frozen in ice man itll happen  liam was it someone special  travis no  matt at this point kiri whos not that far from you because youre still in the bar says like  jester dont eat humans okay yasha goes im going to take her upstairs and heads off to the chamber  travis im going to let you guys take the lead on this im more of a spectator at this point  sam with the hooker  travis no i thought we were 
none	 going out for an hour  marisha sorry you jumped conversations you have to specify  travis thought we were going to warm up into this thing  sam with the hooker  travis no were going out for a bit right  laura why did you give them money though  matt theres a big bassy impact that you can feel in your chest theres a flash of color  outside and there out maybe 20 feet looking up molly theres a flash of the firework in the sky  going across his horns and form  taliesin maniacal 
none	 laughter  travis oh jesus it begins  sam okay lets go make the rounds  matt you walk out in this fair most people who have gathered here theyre sitting there theyre  eating food and theyre watching the fireworks as they go off theres a few folks out there candle  dancers they have these light candles and its this very slow meticulous dance theyre moving  in the darkest places of the corner and give this almost willowisptype performance its really  enchanting and borderline creepy at times when you cant actually make out the forms of 
none	 the  dancer in the shadow people are watching and keeping an intent look on it otherwise the rest  of this thoroughfare is apparently here though youre not sure how much businesses are open  since most people are in the process of recovering from a day of business what do you want to do  liam predictably i would like as i follow this group around to keep one eye open for a bookstore  sam the nerdiest raver  travis can we get you a card and hold it up bookstore  taliesin it needs dónde está 
town	 la biblioteca  matt what else are you guys going to do  taliesin im looking for vendors im looking for things that are amusing bright lights colors  sam if theres any more of those sparklers or poppers around  matt oh yeah there arent a lot of them meaning theres not an endless supply but you go  back to the same people that are just up the road to the right from the outside of the tavern you  can find the same two vendors you spoke with earlier  marisha you want to buy them out 
none	 real fast lets go  sam steal some  marisha we can just pay for it  taliesin you said there were silk flowers theres fake flowers i want to see if i can find  the best looking that new orleans halloween night crazy beautiful overproduced  matt make an investigation check and you make a perception check caleb  taliesin blows a raspberry goddamn it no  sam that is not the snitch just because its gold doesnt mean its a snitch  matt was it a natural one  taliesin that was a two  matt oh 
none	 so not quite a natural one you come upon a number of vendors that have already given  out all their flowers so youre having a hard time finding anybody that still have any for sale  in this main central area  taliesin if anybody sees im looking for silk flowers really something nice something super  fancy if you see anything  laura i want to look for flowers too then  matt well come to that in a little bit  liam i rolled a 19 for buch  matt okay good to keep that in mind 
none	 as we move on  marisha we go pick up some more snappers and poppers poppers and snappers  matt you go back to those two vendors theyre both set up on the side the one guy with the  sparklers is still set up there and the guy with the fireworks is still resting there on the edge  and the other guy with the flowers is set up on the side theres one guy with the sparklers and  the fireworks whos there the thin somewhat dopeylooking young gnomish guy and you have the  flower vendor whos 
none	 slowly settled into himself like a barrel of a gnome  marisha nott the flower guys creepy just felt like throwing that out there before we approach  sam okay all right thank you  marisha i go up to the snapper and popper guys  matt hey welcome back  marisha need more packs  sam no i want something more powerful  marisha plus all the packs  matt i dont really have anything more powerful than these  marisha where do you find more powerful  sam can you make something  travis were arms dealing on

none	 closes up his little satchel and walks away  marisha oh you piece of shit  sam sorry that was my fault  marisha hey dont ever apologize for who you are man  sam no i  marisha you cant help that shit first off  sam i should have known i cant talk to people  marisha you cant predict when people are going to be shitty  sam theyre always shitty its a 100 accurate prediction  marisha thats pretty thats a good point  sam by the way beau thank you for the other day  
none	 marisha when  sam for talking to caleb through his you know  marisha yeah hes a good guy  sam just be sensitive around him i know that thats not your strong suit but he doesnt deal  well with harsh criticism all the time  marisha and you think you do  sam im used to it  marisha thats true  sam tell me something how did you know about this place  marisha hupperdook  sam yeah how did you know that the gnomes here get down with the funky fresh rhythm all night  marisha 
none	 the job that i had before i met up with you guys in zadash information passes through  you hear things  sam what job  marisha i worked at a library the cobalt soul library  sam whats a cobalt soul  marisha it is a faction of monks  sam what kind of a faction of monks  travis is nott slurring her words  sam are you evil are you a bad guy  marisha no i hope not i think it differs from day to day depending on what im doing do you  think im 
none	 a bad guy  sam i dont think so  marisha thats all that matters right  sam but i dont know you seem to know a lot about a lot of things and sketchy things too  marisha that has to do with the job that i had before the job that i had  sam what was that job i thought you grew up didnt your parents make wine or something  marisha yeah  sam what was this about a job wait little townsgirl her parents are wine makers now youre  a brutal assassin martial artist 
none	 who can kill anything what happened in between those two things  marisha yeah theres definitely something missing right  sam yeah right  marisha lets catch up with the others while we walk and talk  sam sure  marisha my dad was super protective and i was an asshole and rebelled a lot  sam you no  marisha yeah you know so when interesting and different people would pass through my hometown i  started making some connections started getting involved in some mainly illegal trading  sam like what what kind of stuff  marisha i 
town	 got in really big trouble from my parents because i started syphoning his cases of  wine and selling them underground for half the cost without tariffs  sam you were bootlegging your old mans hooch  marisha yes i was  travis industrious  sam wow  marisha yeah on top of other things that was like my big denouement you know i dont know i  just grew to hate the town that i was in and the system that my father was a part of  and so everything  sam is he a bad person  
none	 marisha he wasnt a bad person i think he just had bad direction i dont know he couldve been  a good dad he was a shitty dad and a good businessman  sam so you took matters into your own hands  marisha yeah  sam and got in trouble and were sent off to boarding school  marisha yeah kind of  sam with monks who are librarians and taught you how to kill with your fists  marisha one day he found out about what i was doing after id already gotten in trouble for you  
none	 know a little bit of mild extortion and a little bit of trading little bit of trafficking so i  think he was already pretty irritated with me then he found out about my smuggling scheme with  his wine one day he called me down into the living room and there was a whole group of monks  and people in black i tried to fight them off and they grabbed me and they drug me away  sam wait this was not by choice you were abducted by monks  marisha my dad paid to get me abducted 
none	 by monks yeah  sam oh my gosh  marisha he wasnt very proud  sam are you okay  marisha sure great  sam was it hard  marisha yeah i mean there were elements that were hard but everyone has had hardships right  whats it matter besides he sent me off to the monks i think he was hoping that they were going  to beat my indiscretions out of me instead i think all of the things that my father saw in me  that he hated the monks saw as a potential advantage so in 
town	 a weird way i think it mightve  been the nicest thing he ever did for me  sam ive never thought of you as an optimistic person but thats a very positive way of looking at it  marisha i mean i still never really want to see him again and i dont think he wants to see me  again either in fact he told that he didnt want to see me again so its good yeah  matt at this point you guys are caught up with the rest of the crowd as you guys have meandered 
town	  your way and look up and you can see the rest of your party has been wandering the street  marisha but i do have a nice little wineskin that i keep reserved of my familys wine  if you want to taste  sam i would very much  marisha i toss nott the wine  sam ill just take a little sip in case we have to do the hour of power later  matt its pretty damn good wine  sam wow thats amazing  marisha anybody else wants a sip of my heritage  taliesin 
none	 is that code for something  liam it is hard to believe but i was able to do the i danced the waltz and the tarantella  its been many years  laura well you should show me sometime because i want to see it  liam i am very much out of practice and  laura we can do it when nobodys watching okay  taliesin i could see you as a waltzer that make sense  liam it does a little bit  laura im really good at the waltz  liam i believe it  laura yeah 
none	 they taught me the same time i learned piano  liam is there anything else that youre hiding from us any other quirks or skills  laura so many lots of skills  liam what are three more  laura i can paint im really good at baking scones specifically scones  travis with cinnamon right  laura with cinnamon  marisha scones are hard to make  laura i know its a very tough recipe but im good at it  sam the trick is to not overmix you dont want to overmix oh sorry weve been walking with 
none	  your friend beau  liam wait hold that thought so thats two things  laura yes  liam and the third is  laura the third thing is something that i want to talk to fjord about because if hes that  inexperienced then maybe he should take some lessons or something  travis oh my god  sam time is of the essence he might be with a lady of the night later tonight you might have to  teach him quickly  laura thats true  liam and was that skill learned or innate  sam cram 
none	 school  laura no it really was more of a learning sort of thing  liam yeah study is key  laura yes its all about studying  liam thats true  matt at this moment caleb in listening to this conversation your eyes focus on a sign post  behind her on a building that reads bent binders  liam im done here i walk towards the store is it open  matt no the windows are closed  liam oh my gosh i press my nose to the glass and try to see what i can see is 
none	 there a lot of books  in there or just a few books or  matt make a perception check  liam okay  laura ill go put my nose next to his nose on the glass what are we looking for  liam thats a 16  matt as you look through the combination of the two of you eventually the glass fogs up and you  cant see anything but from the brief moment you had on the inside it looks like there are a few  shelves that contains some books it looks like there is actually 
dung	 a binding press and tools for  bookbinding in there  liam from what i can tell does it look like a technical place where they are just making books  or do they have books for sale  matt it looks like they have books for sale but its too dark for you to see if they are blank or  if they are actual books at the moment  liam i cannot tell if its a happy or a sad bookstore  matt you cannot tell yet no just like christmas you must wait til the morning  
none	 laughter  laura are there any silk flowers i was looking for those  matt make an investigation check  taliesin and laura yay  sam yeah tonight when it doesnt matter you roll great  laura shut up 15  matt actually as you guys are fogging up the window you pull back and look to the left and  you can see this adorable little gnome girl with deep tan skin her hair pulled in these cute  little puffy buns in the side of her head and she has this little basket that is just filled with 
none	  these differentcolored silkmaterial flowers shes standing there smiling and you can see an  older gnome sitting in a rocking chair behind her with a big old pipe coming out of his mouth as the  hat is halfcovering his face and hes just sitting there rocking next to her  laura i hop over next to her gasps ive been looking everywhere for you  matt really  laura mmhmm  matt hi  laura you have the best flowers ive ever seen and i would like to buy some  matt oh my goodness thank you so

town	 her  matt oh im very special too  laura gasps really  matt yeah  laura where do you live because i could bring her over and you could play together tomorrow  matt the house is two buildings down that way and back one street you could see it has the red  brick on the base by the door  laura red brick on the base by door ill come see you guys tomorrow  matt okay whats your name  laura my name is jester whats your name  matt tara  laura tara so nice 
none	 to meet you  matt nice to meet you too  laura red brick by the door  matt theres this pause and she goes okay bye  laura okay see you  matt then runs back and goes dad dad dad and starts taking the copper and puts it in his  hand and hes like oh thats a fine job he pulls his hat up a bit and takes the coin he  looks over to you as you walk away and  laura does he seem like a nice dad  matt make an insight check  
town	 taliesin no  laura ooh thats good 22  matt seems like a nice enough dad yeah  marisha happy fathers day  matt anything else you guys wish to do its starting to get relatively close to that hour window  laura do you want many of them because i just bought a bunch  taliesin ill take two then yep  laura flowers  sam yes please  laura flower  liam one please  laura flower  travis are there any authorities walking the street any crownsguard or kingsguard or  matt there are crownsguard its interesting 
none	 because there are half and half for the large  gnomish population here you see half of the crownsguard are gnomish and many of them have  some form of firearm slung over their back and shoulders the other half appear to be human or  halfelf the humanhalfelf crownsguard appear to be less jovial and really paying attention to the  chaos and generally trying to keep an eye out for anything untoward  travis just like sentry though theyre not concerned or turgid or stiff  matt in comparison to the rest of the people that are currently 
none	 celebrating yes but even the  gnomish crownsguard seem to be taking their job seriously but theyre still part of the event  travis among their folks  matt you get the sense here that everyone else gets to celebrate and party at this hour and they  dont get to so they cheat a little bit honestly theres more crownsguard at night than  you expected when you came into the city it didnt seem that heavily guarded but now theyre  out in a pretty serious force you gather probably a combination of there being wartime or because 
none	  the nature of what this city builds as youre glancing out on the outside of the ledge of this  upper area looking down there are a number of torches out by where the construction yards are  down below either people are working through the night down there or theres a fairly heavy  presence of crownsguard present around these partiallyconstructed devices and machines of war  that you saw being worked on earlier in the day  travis looks like they even go through the night thats some dedication  taliesin that seems like a bit much 
none	 doesnt it  travis yeah work ethic can choke you in that way well its about that time should we make  our way back for whatever this is going to be  taliesin i got what i needed im ready  liam just a second nott come here for a moment  sam yes caleb what is it  liam are you going to dance  sam well i think were going to drink first  liam yeah but later it seems like you want to i think you should  sam i do like to dance  liam 
none	 well you should try it you should enjoy yourself but make sure that either jester or i  ties your mask on very tightly yeah  sam should i do the spell that you told me the disguising spell before the dance  liam i mean it would not be a bad idea  sam all right ill do that  liam all the same maybe stay away from direct light you know if you can stay a little bit away from it  sam oh because the shadows wont match  liam ja and some people are smart and 
none	 it wont work  sam okay i will but youll keep an eye out in case anyone  liam that is exactly what i will do  sam all right thank you  liam you should enjoy yourself  sam ill try if you want to join us you could just point and clap off to the side you dont  have to dance you can be there to like  marisha you guys know that dancing is about spontaneity and you are planning this dance like  when this is going to happen so hard  liam i am 
none	 not dancing so it is not really an issue  marisha let your heart go  laura when youre performing you have to have specific moves  marisha sure  sam you saw the guys who kicked you in the face they had plannedout moves that were really cool  laura yeah like choreography thats what were talking about here  taliesin they kick someone in the face every time  marisha i like dancing to dance  sam all right well do choreography to the right and left and you two be in the middle and just freestyle  
none	 laura i think that will work out well make sure you use your scarves though  marisha do you guys still have one of those wands  sam what wands the wand of smiles  laura i have that i hit a random person with the wand of smiles as we walk by them  matt the gentleman whos selling the flower bands is sitting already smiling and goes  laura that guy knows  marisha here i take off my belt ribbon and i tie it around your wand of smiles now you have a  ribbon dancer of 
tavern	 smiles  laura ah  travis how many charges does that thing have  laura i dont remember  sam thats probably it for the day  marisha it recharges right over time  matt yeah it has a few uses on it per day you guys return to the blushing tankard tavern the  musics still blaring drinks are being thrown around a bunch of people are singing big old  songs and clanking their tankards together and spilling onto the tabletops the floor is already  slick with spilled liquor here and there it is a party that 
town	 hasnt stopped since you left as you  guys begin to enter the dwarven woman who you had spoken with earlier gets onto one of the central  tables and slams her foot on the table everyone starts looking over and she goes attention  arseholes might i have your leering eyes upon this supple and available specimen of a woman  you hear some whistles oh thank you she bends forward with a wink to the crowd its as youve  all been waiting for the hour of honor yeah cheers clapping the tokens and titles are at  
none	 stake ol blemmy and his crew hold this winners tokens for the last three weeks and she gestures  over and you can see a team there mostly of gnomes ol blemmy is this dwarf with one giant  gash down his face and the snowblind eye in that socket is sitting there with this tuft of a beard  that has been so unkempt that you cant see his mouth its this grayblack saltandpepper bush  that disappears into a chin beard you assume hes grinning beneath there  taliesin like bread papa  matt kind of yeah beard 
none	 papa  taliesin yeah its all beard papa  matt theyre not willing to let them go who wants to put up their coin and their balls to  topple these nobodies chuckling folks start standing up and tossing some coin on the table at  her feet and shouting out five silver a gold piece three gold over here people are  standing up and their groups are starting to get amped up and ready shes like keep them coming  keep them coming  taliesin ten gold  travis sure  taliesin ten gold  matt whoa by 
town	 the colorful newcomers hi there sweetie  travis oh god  matt do we have more than ten gold here to try and take down these giants of drinking theres a  moment and this one group in the corner these coalsmeared gnomes that come from you can  assume now this is probably a heavy mining town theyre sitting there with elements of their  leather work clothes still on and theyre all thinking and talking amongst themselves and they  all pull in a few more coins and one of them comes forward still wearing leather gloves from 
none	  the day and pops down 15 gold  travis hmm shit  marisha 16  matt 18  laura 20 gold  matt he goes back talking to them comes back 25 gold pieces  laura oh come on i dont even know if i want to do that for 20 gold  taliesin i just dont know how to walk away from something like this  marisha 25 and five silver  sam so petty  taliesin oh for gods sake 30 gold  travis price is right  matt at that point everyone goes whoa with a 
town	 flourish you place the rest of the 30 gold piece  pot on the table ooh  taliesin so youll all be giving me a little bit of gold for this later  matt so turns back and looks back at the miners and they all go heavy sigh  taliesin well be out of town in a week  matt they gather their gold off the table back again and irena goes well if thats it it  looks like our contenders for the night are quietly what are you called  taliesin the mighty nein  matt the 
tavern	 mighty nein  taliesin if i want to be known for something this is exactly what i want to be known for  matt cheers and clamoring continue around and everyone starts shouting and yelling  all right lets set up these drinks people with that final slam on the table she leaps off  onto the ground and starts heading off towards the bar on the side the other bartender the gnomish  gentleman there is rapidly clearing out tankards and drinks and hes starting to pull up bottles  onto the countertop they start pushing tables into the 
town	 center again once more as the crowds  begin to circle around and ol blemmy and the rest of his rather roughlooking crew that have  seen some life in their time  travis fraternity allstars  matt theyre all pretty much gnomish middleage which could be anywhere between 100 to 200 years  old and you can see the weathering on their faces and their clothing they look like they nearly  drink professionally they step up to the table and they figure out what order theyre going to go  in you guys figure out what order youre 
tavern	 going to go in  sam are we all going  travis anybody who wants in  matt theres five on their team and talking to her a bit she goes all right  theres five competitors you need to pick five of your team to compete  sam whos the worst at drinking  laura well ive never been drunk  sam then maybe you should sit this one out  laura but maybe im really good at it you dont know  sam do we want this to be the thing that we find out on  travis 
none	 probably not jester  taliesin caleb howre you feeling  liam i dont think i should go late in the game but i feel capable of this challenge  taliesin excellent  travis i can drink  marisha im pretty good at it too  taliesin im ready for this  sam ive never had a drink in my life  travis our fucking team captain over here  matt whos sitting it out amongst you guys  laura i guess it will be me  travis well we need five  matt you need five yeah  liam we 
none	 have eins zwei drei vier und fünf  sam maybe you can be  laura im taking my five gold back from him and im stomping upstairs  sam you could be the manager of the team  taliesin you can also drink along since well have to buy your drinks for you  marisha i can also give you some magic mushrooms if you want to slip them in their drinks  travis its fungus actually  laura oh but i can work distraction  sam yes you can use your clerical mysticism to confuse and disrupt our enemy 
town	  laura i stomp back down the stairs and i join them  matt as youre coming down you notice jester the crowds are all gathering and theres this big  circle appearing around the central they have two tables that are set up with a single bench  each end you can see a third table behind it where theres probably going to be the dwarf woman  overseeing this venture you do see this little gnome girl thats walking through the crowd and  her hands open and people are  laura is it tara  matt its 
town	 not tara actually but its a rather dirtylooking gnome little girl whos thumbing  through and getting pushed around a little bit her hands are out in front  laura i give her a little money i give her a silver  matt she takes it and thank you barely audible voice and continues wandering in the  crowd so the five of you guys are doing it  sam taliesin travis marisha and liam yes  matt at this point the dwarf woman comes back to the top of the tables there looks out all  right friends i 
none	 am but your humble evening mistress irena clommop and it is my pleasure to  present to you tonights esteemed headtohead drinking battle between ol blemmy and crew and  the mighty nein first up of blemmys crew we have duncan you see this one gnome gentleman  come forward patchy beard more of a stonewall jackson type missing the centerpiece there his  eyes are bloodshot and red his hairs slicked back with some sort of a thick oil and hes  wearing a leather apron over a white stained shirt with the sleeves rolled up past his elbows 
tavern	  he sits up gets on one end of the table puts one hand on his tankard and is waiting for his  competitor and on the mighty neins side whos competing against old duncan  travis listen the anchor needs to be you nott youre our ringer  sam all right so ill wait until theres  travis molly do you want to kick us off  taliesin ill take this in im going to riker right over the chair and sit down  matt whats your name  taliesin molly dear  matt molly all right so well 
none	 take turns she grabs this small barrel its a handheld barrel  she pours both of your drinks to the brim when i clap hands together you both drink its not  first to finish but its one drink after the next first to pass out or lose their drink  forfeits so with your drinks full lets begin with that i need you to roll a constitution  check roll a d20 add your constitution modifier  travis warm it up  taliesin ten  matt you watch as duncan takes it gulping  laura no wait add your 
none	 constitution 12  taliesin oh 12 sorry  matt youre drinking it and getting through it fine youre partway through your drink and hes  already finished slam on the table it was a natural 20 on his end  all oh  matt you finish the drink and youre like burp a little effervescent but its there so  thats one loss on your end how the rules work is that the first to three losses is the one in  these competitive spaces  marisha so you have to drink fast i thought you just said it didnt 
town	 matter how fast  matt no that was just how fast he finished the idea is you both make competitive constitution  checks and the first to three losses in that competition is the one that either barfs or passes out  liam barf saves  marisha copy  matt yeah essentially at that point as soon as you guys drop the drinks next round  fills up both of them the crowd starts cheering go ahead and roll  marisha come on molly  taliesin ugh goddamn it eight  matt he rolled a two plus two so four 
none	  travis yeah  matt this time around you manage to finish a little sooner than him you put it down hes like  burp then chuckling roll again fills up for the third round  taliesin 20  matt you finish your drink a little bit sooner than him plop it down burping grunting from  behind him you hear ol blemmy go dont you lose it boy a voice that grates like its been  slammed across a hundred years of seawater  travis molly how is it  taliesin its rough  matt roll off again  
town	 taliesin 19  marisha yes  matt you finish your drink he takes his next one pops it down and you both stare for a  moment coughing and spitting down the front of his shirt the crowds goes like no tries to  scoop it back up and theyre like no and youre out irena kicks him out of the chair  and hes done first round goes to the mighty nein  travis oh shit  matt he gets off the ground dazed you are fucking drunk molly  taliesin im very drunk  matt he topples back 
town	 to you guys you see duncan get pulled back in the crowd and ol blemmys  like inaudible muttering and under his breath you can hear a string of curse words  next up we have ruth you watch as this rotund toughlooking oval of a gnomish woman comes up  there her hair pulled into really tight braids in the side with bright freckles and this grimace  this woman has seen some shit and lived she gets up to the side takes the same tankard and goes  ill show you how its done duncan fill it  
town	 travis shes got nothing on you shes nothing you got this  marisha my resting bitch face is stronger and i jump in  laura i hop up on the table next to her and start yelling beau beau  all beau beau  matt make a persuasion check  laura i use thaumaturgy to make it sound like other people are chanting with me  marisha yes girl yes  taliesin thats a roll  laura thats a 21  matt with that the crowd starts picking up on beau and the name beau beau beau begins to  
town	 resonate through the crowd you lock eyes with this gnomish woman and you can see there should be  color but the irises are gray slate gray and it puts you off theres this intensity to her  that youre like oh this is  marisha fjord she has crazy eye  matt go ahead and roll  marisha do i have advantage because people are chanting my name  matt no but people are definitely invested in this victory go ahead and make your first roll  marisha dont fuck me gil 16  matt you both chug slam

none	 with you she tilts to the side fast  gulping finishes it in seconds and slams it down heavy slam belch and burps in your direction  while youre still drinking and it catches you thats a loss on your end  travis burns your eyes a little bit  matt yeah next one  travis you got this  marisha dont fuck me gil im going to let it go im going to let it live 19 no 20 no 17  18 19 i know math  matt nice rolls these are not saving throws right this is 
town	 the actual check  marisha plus three  matt got it on that as you both fill this next set of tankards you drink and you finish just  before she does both slam down and shes starting to have to tough into it you can see her  grinding her fingers into the woodwork this is a lot of drinking  marisha i wipe the sweat off with my robe  matt thats two victories to you one victory to her fill up the next batch the crowds still  shouting beau beau beau next roll  marisha nine 
none	  matt this time she toughs it in she grabs with both hands and chugs it down the foam catches the  corner of her mouth and she finishes it and she wipes it off and sips it off her finger  travis brutal  matt thats a victory on her end you guys are both tied the next rolls going to see who takes it  travis win or go home beau eye on the cobalt soul here we go  matt beau beau beau her left eyes twitching as shes glaring at you  marisha all right gil 
tavern	 comes down to you boy  liam come on beauregard  marisha did she already roll  matt she did  marisha frustrated noise six no five  matt with that you both chug maintaining eye contact you get partway into it and then  coughing and retching and you begin backing up into the tankard you try and pass it off and  then as you drop the tankard to gather yourself spitting it sprays onto the table  marisha sorry  matt oh the whole crowd worked up for beaus victory falls into a series of sad awws 
none	 ruth  finishes her drink sets it on the table and teeth sucking turns around and goes back  travis im sure weve got bread around here somewhere just find something to soak all of that up  marisha ugh okay  matt next up we have valkin you see now this very young looks like the runt of his family  line of gnomes comes forward looks very thin brighteyed and very stark contrast to the rest  of them as he gets closer to the table and sits down whos my competitor  liam ja hello my name

town	  taliesin that was an option  travis for you  matt as you guys gather the crowd begins to pull in a bit the evening mistress leans down at you  and goes dont worry lad i can see youre nervous but just let the throat open and take it  in leans back and first batch go roll off  liam grog die yes 21  matt oh shit unexpectedly so little caleb finds his taste for alcohol in this one and with but a  moments notice downs the entirety of his glass finishing it before valkin 
none	 does who says oh  well done thats impressive  liam yes its a good game its just a game  matt fills both of them again next round go for it  travis so polite  liam singing laurentia liebe laurentia mein wann woll  matt your confidence overtakes you as you go into the second round of cups and you manage to  finish but you have to stop halfway through you have to actually go heavy breathing for the  second serving you take it down and finish it however as you pull your glass down you 
none	 can see  valkins there leaning  liam enjoying the fumes as they waft up again  matt i can tell that well done well done  sam maybe we should do our dance to distract his competitor now  laura thats a good idea  matt their drinks are filled go for it  laura directly in front of valkin we start  laughter  matt both of you guys make individual performance checks  laura 19  sam it was 15 but 12  matt he does not seem to be distracted unfortunately what did you roll

tavern	 the rowdy bar music transitions into an actual waltz piece as the  musicians notice this happening the three fourths begins to pick up one two three one two three  as you guys continue to dance a few other couples begin to get up and start faking it they dont  seem to know but theyre watching playfully making up their own waltztype maneuver an  impromptu halfassed waltz begins to develop here in the center of the tavern  sam mollymauk  taliesin im in  sam well dance a bit  matt you guys begin to join

none	 to at some point during the evening lost their  monetary gains as you guys are finding this out what do you do  sam i accuse jester of stealing our money  laura me why would i steal your money  sam youre right its stupid  laura that is really dumb  sam we as detectives should think clearly about this and figure out when was the money stolen  did you all have your money after the competition  marisha yeah we put our winnings we split it up and threw it in the pack  sam 
none	 between the competition and bedtime our money was stolen  laura so it had to be somebody that seems inconspicuous walking around the room and  stealing peoples money  travis its that damn bird  laura kiri i think shed be noticeable downstairs taking peoples money  sam is kiri with us  matt kiri is with yasha  sam kiri did you steal our money  matt chirping like jester go fuck yourself  travis dont stop there shes a kleptomaniac i can tell  laura i might be able to help us also there was this little 
none	 girl who seemed really sweet but she  was walking around inconspicuously throughout the room and maybe she did it  marisha i also dont think this was necessarily a oneperson job normally theres a couple people  doing stuff like that or one person is a runner and one person is a looker  laura maybe we should ask irena if it happens often when these things go on  travis i thought you said you had something  laura oh yes i have a spell that can locate objects  sam that cuts down on our detective work 
tavern	 a lot  laura well i could locate potentially a money purse  marisha do you remember what my bag looked like it matches my sash that you still have on your wand  laura its on this wand yes  marisha i almost forgot we tied that on that was funny man we were drunk  travis can we bring the volume level down  marisha sorry  sam but it was only the five who competed who were robbed  laura it was only the five who got stupid drunk  marisha we were super drunk  sam 
tavern	 it could be because we won and blemmys crew stole our money  laura we should find out if blemmys crew also got stolen from do we remember if blemmys crew  hung around the tavern afterwards  matt to your memory they didnt shortly after the competition tucking their tails they went to  find another place to drink and not have to be in the eyes of people that watched them lose  laura okay  sam so were going to talk to irena and then were going to maybe find blemmy or maybe just  follow locate 
none	 object  liam we are not going to start with the spell that will lead us to it  taliesin i say we start the spell now in case they decide to throw away the coin purses unless  somebody knows something that was in their purse that was of actually of value that they could  recognize i need some bacon does anyone have money for bacon  laura i still have money  marisha nott did you have any of those trinkets like my jade bracelet in your bag  sam im wearing it  marisha fuck  
none	 sam no i only keep my valuable things in other pockets  laura it has to be within a thousand feet and it only lasts for ten minutes  sam within how many feet  laura a thousand which is not that far  marisha lets see if we can get some tips and thats something later  laura what if i cast zone of truth on irena  marisha thats not a bad idea  sam well lets sees if she talks first  travis yeah thats a good idea  laura but how will we know if shes 
none	 telling the truth she seems shady as fuck  sam does she i havent talked to her  laura yeah i dont like her at all  taliesin lets try not to escalate anything too quickly yet  sam molly could use his masculine wiles to talk to  laura i think fjord should do it  taliesin do i have masculine wiles  sam you have pan wiles  taliesin im into it ill take it  laura the affected creature is aware of the spell always  taliesin why dont we save that for the moment that we 
tavern	 have somebody we definitely want to  interrogate instead of somebody who might tell us they dont know anything  travis lets go down and talk to irena  taliesin and get breakfast  laura we go looking for irena i think she did it  matt you guys head down to the bottom floor of the tavern and it is empty from seeing it so  busy the night before it is just 20odd empty tables there is irena at the bar whos  currently sitting down in the process eating a sandwich probably looking a little hungover  
none	 herself sitting at a far table in the middle of cleaning out her fingernails is rissa  laura rissa did it  travis and taliesin no  sam she did it  laura we should get them at the same table and ask them questions because they have to be within  15 feet of me  travis i dont think it was her shes been nice  taliesin if it was rissa what is she still doing here  laura oh good point  sam i still think she did it  travis im thankful for your seedy background 
none	 right now molly  taliesin lets get some breakfast before anything happens  marisha with what fucking money molly  laura with my money ill buy you guys breakfast singing irena  matt you walk up good morning youre all looking appropriately fucked  marisha yeah in a few ways  matt what can i get for you  sam bacon  matt breakfast can be done let me grab that sid sid more breakfast  laura irena did you see anybody taking all of our money last night  matt no why did someone take all your money last 
none	 night  laura does it happen all the time when people do this drinking game  matt if youre not paying attention and you have a lot on you well thats your own fault  marisha do you know anyone where thats their little side hobby  matt i dont know anyone particularly but it happens sometimes thats why most folks that go  out only take a few coins with them  travis the fucking kids had like six coins on them happens all the time  matt if youre walking around with a bank in your pocket i 
none	 mean youre asking for it  laura wait what did you guys do with our cart  travis its out front  taliesin it was strung up  travis it was tied to the hitching post  laura would you have woken up in your drunken stupor  liam of course i would  sam well go check  laura yeah we go look at the cart is it still there and protected  matt you turn around and the cart is protected there are crownsguard that patrol the main area  its not as busy as it was last 
none	 night of course it seems they come out in full force a lot of  them seem to sleep during the day and then come out at night to keep watch because thats when a  lot of things happen but there are a few theres one thats posted on the far corner it looks like  nobodys messed with the cart because it is out in the open  laura shouldve left our money in the cart  travis excuse me can i have a mi hiccups minute of your time  matt are you referring to  travis 
tavern	 the crownsguard  matt okay so youve exited the tavern  travis yeah im walking out  taliesin im sitting down to breakfast  laura im going back in the tavern  sam me too  matt the food is being brought out to you slowly over the next 30 minutes or so the crownsguard  looks to you hes human a bushy not really wellkept blond beard  travis morning  matt morning  travis you go first yeah breathing deeply  matt you all right there buddy  travis we tied one on last night in a harsh 
town	 way  matt i can see youre newcomers to the town then  travis indeed so much so that we seem to have been relieved of our coin during last nights revelry  matt you dont say  travis yeah does that happen a lot around here  matt to conspicuous folks maybe it happens every now and then we try and keep an eye out  there as with any place of business there is always going to be some element of theft nothing  we saw out of the ordinary but we can begin to investigate if you 
town	 like  travis well that might not be necessary i believe it was our fault but just out of  curiosity is there anywhere in town that i dont know there might be an infestation of this sort  of problem do you know any common areas where folks engaged in this sort of activity might  gather at night or in the day areas of trouble that youve dealt with before oh god am i sweating  matt you are profusely i cant say theres a specific region if anything the workplaces here  are not teeming with that 
none	 element the industrious nature of the city keeps itself busy in a very  visible place perhaps somewhat here in the idleworks shelf theres the residential areas of  silver falls those are probably the more likely areas i wouldnt look in the lower half up here  in this shelf and beyond would probably be the most are you sure i dont mind i could  probably keep an eye out is there any information you have about these individuals who robbed you may be  travis sighs were a little light on details unfortunately you know what im 
none	 going to go eat  a half a cow and then maybe once thats soaked up some of this ill return if i remember anything else  matt yeah i think you should go do that  travis all right thank you have a good morning  matt you too he sits back into his post looking a bit confused  sam ask irena about the little girl  laura irena what about the little girl  matt i dont know what youre talking about which little girl  laura theres a little girl that was walking around last night 
none	 that was asking for money and stuff  matt oh yeah the beggar she comes in every now and then some folks help her get along  laura she doesnt steal things  matt not that ive seen shes like a waif whatre you talking about make an insight check  marisha is she lying to me does she know more 12  matt i mean as best as you can read she seems to be forthright as best as you can read  laura im going to cast zone of truth  matt okay so whats the saving throw 
none	 on that whats the dc  travis i like it  laura charisma  travis cut to the fucking chase  laura 15  travis trim the fat  matt no she fails she goes like whats going on  laura what are you talking about  matt because if i recall yeah she is aware of the spell shes like what sort of trickery are  you doing here i dont like this ill ask you to leave  laura oh i dont think you need to do that im just you know curious about what happened last  
town	 night if you have ever seen any shady figures in here  matt there are many shady figures that come through here its a town  travis cooing more specific  laura do you know of anyone who wouldve stolen coins from people  sam who was here last night  matt there was a lot of people here last night i know youre asking me look im a  shadylooking character sometimes as well i cant pick it theres a lot of hardworking people here  laura did you steal the money  matt i did not steal your 
none	 money  laura im just checking do you know who stole our money  matt no i dont know who stole your money  laura hey rissa come here for a second  taliesin but if you were going to suspect somebody who would it be  matt i dont know you damn well pissed off ol blemmy hes a possible one otherwise i dont  know if anyone got too friendly with you last night i mean youve got to get close to take your money  laura was anyone friendly with you guys  taliesin not with me 
none	  matt i didnt send any people up to your rooms because you told me not to pay for i was holding  your cash which ive still got by the way and the offer still stands but  marisha is there a thieves guild  matt i dont know probably  laura rissa come here  matt rissa comes up i can help you  sam irena if molly was interested would you like  laura snip his  sam no just like  taliesin i dont understand what youre trying to imply here  sam nevermind lets go 
tavern	 to rissa  laura no seriously though what was this why is this having sex  sam dont you guys use scissors when you have sex with each other  marisha is this a goblin thing  taliesin this might be a goblin thing  sam this is real  laura stop it  liam just a boulder parchment shears reference its simple  laura rissa do you know of anyone who steals money from drunk people  matt not personally im sure there are folks out there  laura did you see anyone taking our friends money last night 
tavern	  matt she rubs her temples and you can tell she is a little hungover herself too shes like no  taliesin did those two gentlemen come back into the bar at any point  travis fitz and ashton  laura ooh good call  matt i saw them come in at one point but then leave when they noticed i was still hanging with  you folks so thank you for that i appreciate that  taliesin i mean at the very least thatll be fun  laura man do we have any other questions to ask who are 
none	 you all attracted to do you guys like me  sam thats what i was trying to get to wait us we have to answer truthfully  laura yeah because you were standing next to me anyway  liam if youre within 15 feet  sam youre not my type  matt if all the rest of you are in the area  taliesin everybodys my type im really pretty easy  liam i was at the door i dont know how big the place is  matt if anybody else steps into that zone you have to make a 
none	 saving throw  liam i was going to do something before jester did what she did  marisha what was your question  laura who are you attracted to do you like me are we friends do you really like me and stuff  matt make a saving throw  marisha wow that was a layer of questions  sam i like you youre nice  laura really  sam yes  matt charisma right  laura yeah  marisha what is it charisma saving throw 16  matt yeah you resist it  marisha i like you a lot 
town	 heres the deal  laughter  marisha has there been a raise in criminal activity is there something in the town that  would start provoking people to want to pickpocket more is the rise in the war effort bringing  people down theres got to be some reason  matt rissa goes i mean its possible i imagine people are distracted theyre working  hard theyre having to push out double time in a lot of their work to get things out to the front  lines its possible  taliesin whoever took our purses has our drink tokens 
tavern	 too  marisha they do have our drink tokens that was in the bag  travis you didnt need to remind her shes ready to pop as it is all right  taliesin im just saying that if drink tokens come back to the bar  laura then you know gasps  marisha i wouldnt come back the next night if it were me i would want to make sure that we were gone  taliesin but somebodys got them  liam how could they even use them because only the winners that everyone saw won them  sam theyre 
none	 probably not going to use them theyre just one drink they would keep  all the hundreds of gold  taliesin i would keep it though  marisha but i think that could be a better target for your lost object spell  thats what i was thinking  laura yeah because it probably blends in are they the same sort of shape as regular coins  matt they are but theyre wooden and a little bit bigger than an actual gold coin  taliesin anytime ive stolen something i couldnt use later ive always kept it for  sentimental 
none	 reasons im not sure why  marisha yeah its a prize its a reminder of your good job  laura thats smart should i cast it  taliesin i dont steal anymore much sometimes  marisha hang on irena  matt yes what you asking  marisha do you have any new staff members  matt no its just me and syd at this point syd brings out the last of the food the male  gnome who you saw when you first entered hes like so all of your food is ready enjoy  marisha you mentioned being able 
dung	 to get us friends and other type of services where do you  find those resources  matt through a friend of mine  marisha whats her name  matt why are you asking me all these questions i didnt send anyone up to your room  and im not going to spill all of my business propositions your direction  marisha i dont think you did any of that at all i just think you might know who did even if you  dont consciously know i think you have an idea  matt not really lass  laura 
none	 shes telling the truth  liam do you give a shit about our problems  matt no  travis rissa do you know where this ashton and fitz stay  matt she nods and takes another sip of her morning coffee and goes aye theyre about two  blocks down from my fathers shack a couple of kids that although at this hour theyre probably  working at the anvil  marisha if i wanted to go hock some stolen goods where would i go  matt i dont know i havent hocked stolen goods around here im sorry  
none	 sam one more question  matt to which one you have both rissa  sam irena where does the pianist live  matt what of the band  sam yeah the guy playing the piano  matt here he has a room on the third floor  laura well maybe if i cast locate object well find out  sam whats his name we never asked  laura he was really talented though i mean like super duper  matt he was weimar  laura weimar  taliesin he had to flip a page for that one it was exciting 
none	  travis why dont we start by going around where fitz and ashton lived and then maybe we can pay a  little visit to rissas pops  taliesin yeah she said they lived by her pops place  laura yeah well go and ill cast locate object and maybe well just pass by something  taliesin i wanted to meet pops anyway he sounds interesting  matt shes like oh all right fair warning pardon me rough morning  taliesin we feel that  matt so where are you wanting are you looking for the boys the steelbringers forge 
town	 first or  going to my pops place  taliesin well go to your fathers place first i think well maybe if were in the mood pop into  their place while theyre not home perhaps  marisha who what the fitz and that guy  matt okay follow me she gets up and finishes her coffee sets it back down and you guys take  whatever scraps remain of your breakfast and make your way back out into the street  laura pocket bacon before we leave i ask irena whos still in the zone of truth are you 
tavern	 really  interested in fjord or are you just flirting with him because it makes you some money and stuff  matt both im a businesswoman but ive got my needs  laura oh okay thank you i cast locate object on the coins  sam already were not there yet now okay  laura it lasts for ten minutes what if its in the tavern still  sam makes sense  matt okay so you cast it youre in the tavern youre not getting anything  sam lets run  taliesin were going to put you on a cart 
town	 and were going to take the cart  laura i feel like well walk faster than the cart will go  taliesin will we walk faster than the cart will go  matt in the town getting the cart around can be a bit of a pain its comparable but you also  have to deal with a cart  laura lets walk quickly  matt rissa leads you further through the shelf at this point once again the town is fairly quiet  and most folks you do see in the street are in the process of carrying supplies 
none	 there are a few  horsedrawn carts that have stacks of metal ingots that are being taken from above or below or vice  versa you can see partially made metal plates and curved structures of larger things that are being  developed and created separately and then all being brought to a singular location probably  down near the artillery yard its a very interesting black and white day and night  separation of how the people live in this city a short jaunt around probably the spell does fade  before you get there but youre still not 
none	 picking up any blip about a few minutes after the spell  fades you get to the outside of a small shack its got metallic siding there are rivets in it  you see it has a roof that is metal sheets there is a smokestack on top thats giving out this lazy  smoke drip that makes its way into the sky and a sign out front that says tinkertop inventions  marisha and laura aw  travis when we get there after our run i chuck up a little salsa into the back of my throat and  
none	 swallow it down  taliesin really all right  matt she goes sighs rissa rolls her eyes and knocks on the metallic door yes come in dad  its me i have some friends here they just want to say hi they got thieved oh thats all  right come on in certainly sighs she opens the door and on the inside you already hear the  whirring of hundreds of tiny clockwork objects on the inside you can see wall to wall clocks of  all sizes some broken springs exposed some that are fixed and clicking away some 
dung	 that have small  sculptures that move in a circle around a central area you can see partially made pulleys small  toys that are set up on the corner some wooden some metal and all of them have some sort of  builtin clockwork locomotion to them though they are currently still there are two sets of  lanterns that are hanging in the back giving the faint light which is as you enter giving this  dark silhouette to a lot of these objects but as you walk into the light and look behind you you  can 
none	 see the detail work in them and theyre very beautiful and very wellmade its at that point you  hear a crash ah ugh you glance over and you can see hopping up and down running his hand  like this this older gnome character with patches of whitegray hair this big bush of a white  beard its welltrimmed up here and then comes to a point at the bottom very large spectacles with  a number of smaller and even smaller lenses in the front of it hes currently wearing a leather  apron and sleeves that are 
none	 rolled up and one of his hands is currently now bleeding on the edge  and hes like distressed noises im terribly sorry about that come forward she said youre  the friends of my lass there how are you doing whats your names  travis morning were the mighty nein we had the pleasure of meeting your daughter yesterday she  showed us a great time last night  matt oh did you dear thats so nice youre making friends rissas like dad please stop  it look they just wanted to come by they had some questions i 
town	 think do what youre going to  do please so we get going  taliesin how close are we to the other houses at this point to the boys  laura probably not within a thousand feet  matt the boys she mentioned earlier are a few blocks down or a few buildings down and up from  where you are well at the very least let me introduce myself im mastermaker cleff tinkertop  laura cleff or cliff  matt cleff  taliesin i was excited to see what sort of stuff  matt creator and experimenter of all 
none	 things metallic and clicking  laura your shop is beautiful  matt thank you so much i appreciate that so yeah what can i do for you  laura do you have any little toys that kiri would like  matt whats  sam kiris our little daughter shes a bird  laura kiri is right here  matt you look over and yashas still behind kiri chirping hes like thats a mighty big bird  laura shes a little girl  matt she leans forward looks up to him like cleff shes a mighty big bird hes like  
none	 thats a nice trick on that one i like that  laura shes very talented  matt do you like and he pulls this small contraption its actually a miniature version of  what you saw those large bolt throwers that were constructed out front where it has this bowed arc  and theres a small blunted stick in it he goes all you do is pull back on this trigger ping  it fires off narrowly missing the side of beaus head hits something and you hear glass shatter  in the background and he goes oh maybe not 
none	 that one puts it back cranking and hands something over  to kiri who accepts it theres a moment where things are awkward and theres a tension and  youre about to go before it opens up and from the inside you see this tiny metallic bird its wings  flap up and down a music box begins to play metallic song and kiri looking at this begins  mimicking exactly the sound of the music box metallic song its almost one beat behind it  until it synchronizes and shes mimicking at such an incredibly fast pace behind it 
none	 that theyre  almost in unison until eventually it slows down and comes to a stop kiri looks back to you chirping  laura do you like it how much is that  matt oh that one its a beautiful piece ill be happy to let it go for about three gold pieces  laura three gold pieces i think thats worth it kiri okay three gold pieces  matt theres a whole smattering of cool contraptions now that youre looking at the back too  some that look like they could be armaments almost some that look like theyre

none	 kind thats affixed to this large device it looks like a crossbow but its got a heavy crank on one  side and it has all these extra grooves put in where its easy to assemble a bolt in there the  actual shaft of it is made of this polished treated wood with metal casing where the grip is  its like a halfclockwork gearbased crank hand crossbow  travis a repeating crossbow  marisha its a repeating crossbow  sam how does it work  matt well you lower the bolt into here and you crank it back 
dung	 real fast and its like  squeaking as he cranks it i probably have to oil this crank it then you just release this  one goes just parting calebs hair into the roof above  liam how many gold is that toy  matt well this one you see i had a friend of mine go ahead and help prepare it  with some magical enchantment  laura distorted whoa  sam what the fuck was that  laura i dont know it sounded like a cow or like a manatee was at the table i dont know  
none	 matt i call this one the tinkertop boltblaster 1000  laura whoa  taliesin what happened to the other 999  laura how much is it  matt this one runs just over 2000 gold  laura whoa that is a lot of gold  matt well its my prototype so if im going to let it go  sam am i allowed to rob him  marisha and taliesin no  matt rissas like dad they dont want it its fine no one wants all your bullshit please  travis thats not true it actually is quite impressive

none	 i didnt see coming and we  couldnt control it it began to just destroy whatever was in its way  liam are you speaking of an automaton  matt more or less  laura did it kill people  matt they tell me they keep it down there still theyve sealed it off and its been  there for the better part of two years and every now then they like to remind me i didnt mean  anything bad by it i was just doing my job and i thought i was very proud of my work i 
none	 didnt see  the problems there i was just trying to help  marisha how do they remind you  matt they come by and tell me  travis are there punishments levied against you  matt thankfully not many im still paying off my fine they were going to try and destroy the  thing but unfortunately theyve had to allocate their attention to many places and now with the  war coming i dont know if theyll ever get to it but as long as its down there its a black  spot on my name and her

town	 led down past a few buildings and then around the corner and while most of the  heavy metalworks is done down below on the ground floor of the base of the mountain the more  refined metalworks are done up here on the shelf as you approach you can already see the  steelbringers forge which has a number of shields and swords on display armor bits and you  can see simple tools are crafted here as you step already looking into the main chamber door  which is open because its so hot in there they have 
none	 to keep a breeze going through there are  two forges going at any given point in time there are two anvils set up you see a few gnomes at  work and indeed both fitz and ashton are both working as assistants theyre not actually  banging the hammer but theyre both helping move things and quenching into the water and then  helping gather materials and holding the metal and rotating it on the anvil as their bosses are  hammering down they dont seem to notice your arrival  laura i use thaumaturgy to make it sound 
none	 like whispers of infernal all around them  matt hammering  all speaking infernal  matt hold back boys there is one male gnome and one female dwarf that are both sitting there  grabbing their nearby warhammers look around they look over and see the shadows in the corner  what beast brings their way into our workplace name yourself  laura oh hi  matt they look at each other the dwarf female goes hammering back to work you see the two  assistants look over and go and put their heads down and keep focused on their 
none	 work the gnome  says just take a break hi can we help you  taliesin were here to talk to those two  matt what did you do he slaps with a cloth and the assistants like ah i didnt gah  what did the boys do whatd they do  laura they might have been party to a crime we dont know were investigators  matt you can see across the way ashtons like gasps and the dwarf goes well then best go  talk to them gives them a little kick to the side and they both 
none	 take their hammers down they  take the metal off and put it back in the forge to heat and they both rest and cross their arms and  watch the two boys look at each other and sheepishly step forward hi miss what can we  do what are you asking about yeah what can we do  marisha we talk in here or are we going to take them outside  matt rissa goes i dont know kind of like to do it in a place of business that way we can keep  it above the board

none	 at each other and look at you guys and  go laughs im not going to lie those boys are going to be pissing their pants for a week after  that that was enjoyable  travis yeah might scare them straight  matt i hope so they need it theyre a couple of pissants anyway weve got to go find some  replacements but thank you for helping out with the transition at least  travis its our pleasure  taliesin we hate to bother you also but we did actually get robbed and if you have any idea 
none	  where we should start looking to actually  sam everyone everywhere  matt they both look at each other and be like maybe ask down at the assembly yard theres a  bunch of weird folks that wander down there  taliesin i like weird folks  matt lifelong industrial hammer workers not a lot of craft and skill mind gets a bit addled  taliesin bless you  laura thank you  matt of course anyway weve got to go get back to work  travis we take our leave  matt you guys wander outside  sam

none	 shields and swords they looked fairly standard or were there  some that were like holy shit  matt no they seemed pretty standard i mean wellmade looks like a lot of places like this  are in the process of developing weaponry not just for home use but probably sending it out for  the field  travis yeah rissa how far are we from this assembly yard  matt she goes the assembly yard is down in the bottom half of the city so its say about an  hour hour and a half walk  travis and 
none	 just out of curiosity the silver falls the residential area how far is that  matt well thats that way about 25 minutes to get to the actual falls themselves and you see  all the little towers over there those are where all the homes are assembled in that place  travis ol blemmys over in the silver falls that residential area do we want to go there or  sam our list of suspects is as follows  travis softly oh shit  sam the pianist blemmy rissa the girl  laura the little girl that was asking 
none	 for money  sam fitz and ashton weve eliminated as possible suspects fitz and ashton really theyre really  lame the pianist  laura why  sam because you did locate object within his  laura youre right thats true we did do that  sam rissa because she was in zone of truth  travis yep  marisha yeah  sam that leaves our suspects blemmy and the girl  travis but we have no leads on the girl correct no one saw her knows her name  marisha blemmy might know the girl  laura i saw her 
none	 but i did not ask her name  sam but she has your copper pieces  laura i gave her silver  travis you did  sam you did could you find those specific silver pieces or the money she stole from us  travis do you bite your silver pieces before you put them in your coin purse  marisha did you lick it  laura i dont but i do draw dicks on a lot of my money but i dont think i did it to those  travis like little tiny dicks  laura well i have 
none	 really good paint you know  sam so we go find blemmy  travis silver falls  laura yeah  sam silver falls thats the residential area where the finger towers apartments are  taliesin we can keep asking has anyone had  anything purchased  laura that was a lot of money  taliesin with dicks on it  laura that too no wait because they didnt steal my money  travis if there was a way to ask about  laura i have a whole pouch full of money you guys right here  travis if you could 
none	 ask about large purchases that would be a good idea  laura big pouch  travis silver falls  sam silver falls  sam matt and laura singing to tune of silver bells silver falls  matt with rissa guiding you guys back you manage to make your way outside of the main idle shelf  area and in towards the cluster of the silver falls as you approach you can see the beautiful  very wide waterfall that cascades down about a thousand feet across the mountainside until  eventually it falls into this large lake where you can 
none	 see columns of steam are rising up the  closer you get you begin to realize that there is an element of this lake this waterfall and some  sort of a steam enginetype mechanism built into the surrounding rock that they use to fuel  probably the furnaces and elements of the technology within this city as you begin to hit  the residential area you can see these large somewhat crookedlooking towers that themselves  are maybe what would be the equivalent of 1500 to 1000squarefoot apartments but stacked four or  five on top of each other 
town	 with spiraling stairs on the outside to go to each level there arent a  lot of folks currently at home other than stayathome dads or moms that are watching  children some folks that are putting out laundry on lines that are connecting between multiple  towers and are dangling up two or three stories above the street but theyre all made of dark  irons and blacker metals so it gives the district this very weirdly whats the word im looking  for a whimsical industrial revolution feel its a unique mixture  laura dr seuss meets  
none	 matt kind of or a hint of howls moving castle in places theres also that spray of the  waterfall hitting the lake behind which gives occasionally this light misting of water through  the air you can see faint bits of rainbow that come through where the mist hits the sunlight as  it makes its way across the waterfall spray  laura you said the waterfall goes up a thousand feet  matt mmhmm  laura and the apartments dont go as high as that  matt no not at all  laura so if i got in 
town	 the middle of the area and cast locate object it would do a really big  radius it would reach at least the top of the buildings  matt oh yeah very much so  sam lets go  laura okay  matt okay as you make your way through youre not entirely sure where ol blemmy is but you  make your way towards where the middle rissa says of the district is  travis keeping an eye out for old craggly sailortypes  matt sure make a perception check  travis me yep  laura should i cast 
town	 locate object while were walking around  liam in a center spot  sam will you be able to cast it again  travis eight  laura yeah i mean if i use up all my spells today as like this kind of thing  sam why did you  matt its a 2ndlevel spell do you want to cast it again or not  laura i can  sam just while we stroll through the town  marisha through the residential district  sam sure i guess what are you searching for  laura the drinking coins right  
none	 liam yeah the tokens  matt the tokens  marisha i think its the best way to go  laura cast spell  matt okay you cast locate object you concentrate and focus extending your  consciousness focusing on one of these wooden tokens the one that was won by one of the members  of your party pop you get a blip behind you not quite in the district but right where the  idleworks shelf transitions into the residential area on the idleworks shelf you get boop  laura gasps ah i turn around and start running towards 
town	 it  sam follow her shes a bloodhound  travis throwing up while we do it  matt you guys dart after jester making your way down the road running panting youre closing  the distance you weave through a couple buildings youre out of the residential part of  the district again and youre back into the idle shelf but on the very back end of it theres  warehouses and theres small buildings and eventually you come to the destination and it  looks like its a small building theres a sign out front that just says butcher 
town	 and its  boarded up  travis yep that motherfucker had leather apron with shittyass sleeves  marisha he totally fucking did  sam was it blemmy  marisha no it was the guy with the nasty fucking beard  sam they all had nasty beards duncan valkin ruth and tanya  laura it was duncan  marisha duncan that was his name right the guy that you drank across  liam we should probably keep our voices down in the street  travis lets turn it down  marisha wait was duncan the nerdy guy  sam the first

none	 no theres a door in the front and a door at the back the door in the front is like a  sectional door a top and a bottom looks like it can be opened separately to sell out or wants to  bring and sell meat over that side the back is just a general door it looks almost like a  storage space or a back entry to it  travis outstanding  liam no open windows  sam should we draw them out  matt there are windows but theyre boarded over  sam were just going 
none	 to bust in what if they have traps and bombs  marisha im going to very gingerly lean over the edge of the roof where fjord is im going to say  whispers on the boom  travis whispers okay  marisha im going to go back over to the chimney very gingerly pull out one of the firecrackers  one of the bottle rockets light it with the tinderbox and drop it in  travis awesome  marisha is the chimney wide enough for me to fit in santa clausstyle  matt you can try yeah you can certainly

none	 half weeks ill say estimated at the moment  sam how long would it take do we think to get up north there if we went straight a week  marisha from hupperdook  matt i would say off the top of my head a little under a week  sam so weve got a couple weeks we have a day or two to spend on some prison breaking  taliesin weve got a day or two to spend on this but not a week  marisha hang on this thing has been a problem for years the clockwork warden 
none	 why dont we just  go finish our stuff we have to cross back through here anyway  laura and come back  marisha and come back and finish the job  liam we already have a job  sam beauregard dont you think they should be reunited with their father who loves them very  much and wants to be with them  marisha of course i do theyve been scrappy for long enough they can be scrappy for another week  or two  laura they dont even have to be that scrappy now  travis they said 
none	 the tithe man could return any day  sam and take them to an orphanage  travis what if we come back and theyre gone  sam it would be horrible if they were taken away from their home and given to some people who would  do horrible things to them or mistreat them for their whole childhoods leaving them as cold  heartless resting bitches  taliesin didnt you almost open fire on these children not more than 30 seconds ago  sam that was an intimidation tactic i would never hurt a child  taliesin of course

none	 were in there we can sneak around and set the parents free  marisha all right if we do this i think we need to give ourselves a hard time limit that we all  stick to because the last thing that i want is for the fucking gentlemen with his vials of our  dna coming after our asses  travis agreed  laura as long as we give him some notice i think it will be okay  marisha i have a feeling the gentleman isnt a guy that negotiates on time periods  travis the effort is 
none	 all i ask for were a clever group surely we can survey come up with a  plan try something if we fail we fail and well move on with our objective i cant leave  here without trying  liam i would like it to be predicated on us coming up with at least a respectable plan not  willynilly fly in with our balls out  taliesin im also in it for a crossbow  marisha i guess it doesnt hurt to ask the gentleman if worst comes to worst  taliesin just remember you either get the
