none	 here as soon as they  thump from sams mug  matt well played so to give us a little overview of the current story two nasty  individuals known as the briarwoods lord and lady briarwood have for the past five years been  occupying the city of whitestone which was once the home to percival here after it was forcefully  taken from his family most of which seemingly have been either killed or lost in the process  and he was scattered to the four winds to find vox machina after encountering the briarwoods in emon  
tavern	 in a scuffle that took place the briarwoods retreated to whitestone inviting the party to  come and say hello since then the party has prepared the best they could made their way  towards whitestone and through some bit of infiltration and subterfuge managed to sneak into  the city itself they under the guise of scanlans seeming illusion appeared to be as  common folk as the rest of the poor saps that still live in whitestone they scoped out an  abandoned tavern which they fitted to their needs as a base of operations and also managed 
town	 to come  across a central portion of whitestones city structure and history known as the sun tree a  tree once risen to the might of the god of the sun pelor now lies dead in the center of town  and from it hung eight figures that appear to have been individuals killed hung and painted up and  dressed to resemble vox machina as essentially a warning or a welcome its hard to tell when it  comes to the briarwoods nevertheless a message was definitely delivered the party retreating  back to the tavern set up 
none	 for the remainder of the afternoon keyleth carved through her druidic  magical ways through the ground to find some of the roots of the sun tree and began preparing an  extensive timeconsuming ritual in hopes of restoring some semblance of life to the entity  itself that is where we left off while the rest of you have been going about your preparations for  the rest of the afternoon as this ritual for keyleth is an eighthour ritual and it begun in  the early afternoon around 200 so this will conclude by around sundown a little 
none	 past sundown  while she is down there essentially meditating with the barren roots of the sun tree is there  anything you guys would wish to do or are you just waiting for her to complete her ritual  taliesin well there are options  sam what do we need we have to get water right there was some issue about we dont have any  water do we  taliesin was that an issue  sam i dont remember there was some wells around  marisha can i do a few checks while im preparing the ritual to 
none	 see if this is a  curse over this tree  matt go ahead and make a religion check i guess  marisha not great hang on my ring of protection is in the way nine  matt nine honestly its hard to tell if its a curse the tree itself is just dead you are very  wellconnected with the natural essences of the world the life essence of plants and natural  growth all of your interactions with the sun tree are devoid of any response it seems dead where it  stands but as you continue your 
none	 ritual  marisha god i hope this works  matt anyone else have anything they want to do  liam well couple of things grog and i were keeping watch i forget one of us was on the  first floor and ones on the second im just going to say that i was on the second for now  because i cant remember its probably wrong im going to take all daggers out of my blinkback belt  except for the keen dagger and replace them with wooden stakes that i purchased and im going to  spend an 
none	 hour or so whatever it takes to ive got partial gloves on im going to take that  symbol of sarenrae and im going to take as much time as it needs to sew it so that it is fixed  firmly to the back of my right hand i tell grog that im going to go down below and check and i  follow the path all the way down to find i think everyone else is down there  sam oh hi vax  liam i step over scanlans head and i kneel down by keyleth and gently 
none	 place a hand on her shoulder  and say what do you need what can i get  marisha i dont really know i dont know if this is going to work to be totally honest the tree is  dead do you have any of that holy water  liam i got holy oil not water  marisha do i have holy water i dont know if i took one or not i cant remember  matt if you didnt write it down its not in your inventory  marisha im pretty good about that i dont think i 
tavern	 took one  taliesin in the meantime there are options  liam i got two i remember it it was two vials of holy oil i gave one to my sister and i have  the other if you think it will help you take it  marisha okay  liam do you need me to get water  marisha yeah lets get some water  matt yeah because as you guys went through the tavern you found there was no actual water there  was old ale there were still a few casks of wine stuff that was abandoned 
tavern	 when whoever previously  was the owner of this tavern either left whitestone or fell to a worse fate but there was  no plain water to drink  liam im going to go out into the street im going to find water  taliesin i can show you where theres water  sam what  taliesin i lived here my whole life  sam are you guys disguised  liam yeah we all are  matt theyre still technically under your seeming spell for the next few hours at least  marisha yeah we cannot let that go  
none	 sam does that have a range no it just lasts  matt as far as i know it lasts just for an eighthour period ill doublecheck  liam percival do you want to come upstairs to the window and  sam im coming  liam oh youre coming too all right youre my son lets go  laughter  matt yeah it lasts for eight hours and allows you to change the appearance of  sam great were still peasants  marisha remember we also have heroes feast up  taliesin yeah  sam oh okay  marisha advantages on 
none	 wisdom throws and whatnot  taliesin hit point bonus advantage on wisdom throws  marisha yeah 2d10 hit points max hit points  taliesin i have my advantages still so im going to lead them to the closest well  matt okay stealthily  marisha im going to start ive kind of cleared out around the roots  matt its a lot its earth and then giant roots from a very large tree that go past you arent at  the bottom of the roots youve met the roots as you were carving through they go even deeper than  
none	 where you are right now  marisha yeah can i start carving a little ravine around it for where were going to start pouring  the water  matt if youve already started the eighthour process of the secondary spell you would not be  able to really interrupt that to be able to continue another spell youve been doing i could  say that you did that as part of your preparation for the roots thats fine thats fine itd be a  small ravine because you also dont want to  marisha damage anything  matt you continue 
tavern	 your ritual the rest of you make your way out the same window that you  entered into the alleyway following percival you lead them to the back of the tavern into one  of the large alleyways between this chunk of the city you find there was a grassy area most of  the grass here has turned gray and brittle as it is starting to push towards the winter months and  even for the daytime the temperature is pretty chilly its probably around 50 or so degrees 55  fahrenheit for our unamerican friends eventually you make 
none	 your way to the nearest well  that youve been to and there is a bucket there it looks like it has gathered some dust and some  cobwebs you get the bucket and you let it down and eventually it finds its way into the water  its pretty deep before it hit the water you dont know if its been just like water level  or if this particular well itself is drying up but you manage to get a bucket up and you pull it  up and check it and it looks clear you take the 
tavern	 water back with you to the tavern seemingly  uneventful you guys have managed to stay far enough out of sight nothing seems to caught your  attention  sam okay should we scout around and see if theres anything else around the hideout that we  should be aware of or any other hiding places or safehouses  liam i feel like we should probably bring a little more water than one bucket so we should  spend a little bit of time doing that but maybe my sister and i can have a look around see if  
none	 theres anything that weve missed outside  taliesin well heres the question theres three lordly houses that we have to avoid at all costs  for now theres a few shops that if we feel might be in our best interest to scout out i know where  an old weapons depot used to be we could check the temples to maybe see if we could maybe find  some support to begin with  liam do we trust anyone here  sam we need friends  taliesin there might be people i trust  sam is there a central 
town	 meeting place  taliesin theres a temple  sam is that a place where you can really chat up brand new people or is there a pub i guess its  not really a pub town is it  taliesin its not a pub town and its a place where you dont necessarily chat up new people  but maybe find some old ones  sam okay we could go there  liam percival were on your turf so ill follow your lead  taliesin sighs if we have just enough time id like to try to go to the 
none	 temple and the cemetery  leave maybe grog and vex to guard keyleth  matt okay so keyleth youre staying behind to finish the ritual  marisha im doing what i do best and i focus all my energy on this thing  matt there are two temples in here theres the temple to pelor which is known as the zenith  within the graveyard  taliesin yes the zenith is the one i wanted to go to  sam whats the other one  taliesin the other one is called the ladys chamber its a temple of erathis  
none	 sam that sounds fun  taliesin i dont know anybody there  sam i might  taliesin thats what im afraid they might know you so no  matt so the ladys chamber the temple to erathis is more central to the city and is  partially a courtyard partially a halfdome amphitheater place of worship you guys make your  way through the city ill have you all roll stealth checks if you could  sam were not trying to hide are we  matt well if youre not trying to hide then make deception checks instead  taliesin 
none	 awesome possum  sam i rolled an 18 for something  liam can i choose to hide instead of deceive  matt if youd like to  liam yeah ill hang a little bit back from them  taliesin i was trying to be stealthy as well  matt okay  taliesin although im fine either way 23  sam im better deceiving  matt okay  liam 26  matt so we have two folks staying to the shadows best they can in broad daylight in a clustered  city and one childlooking pauper of a boy wandering through 
town	 the city alone towards the  graveyard as you guys make your way through staying off to the side jumping or running  through buildings and staying off the main path you walk along the central road to the far eastern  side of whitestone a few folks come out during the day some are carrying bundles of textile  goods theres one guy that has a small cart and it looks like hes bringing tools and stuff either  to or from a store of some kind gives you a curious look as if he hasnt seen you before 
town	 but  doesnt seem to  sam gday sir  matt gday and just keeps rolling along the wheels squeaking as he pushes up the road  sam i wish i had a yoyo  taliesin how about a wheel and stick  sam oh the wheel and stick would be good  matt eventually you guys make your way to the far eastern side of whitestone this is where the  boundary wall that surrounds most of the city from a defensive standpoint lies there is the multiple  exit points throughout this wall you dart around the outskirts 
town	 of it being careful to avoid the  pattern of the undead giants that are slowly stomping through the city like these hulking  sentinels that walk in a perpetual pattern through the town you follow the winding path through the  thick woods just on the outside of the wall of the city itself you sticking to the path in your  open way or do you want to join them in the side of the forest  sam well ive got to stick with them i guess although i like being a young peasant boy its  kind 
town	 of fun all right ill go with them  matt all right so the three of you dart off into the woods skirting the outside of the road but  making your way following it to the outside of the graveyard itself eventually you come to the  outside of the graveyard large iron fence that marks the outside of it its rusted from time  small spikes mark the very top of it about six feet tall and the gate itself is partially open  with a little bit of breeze thats blowing through very very cold breeze that 
none	 blows through  this part of the forest its opening a little bit and creak against itself you push through  the gate  liam wait a minute nope let me look im just going to move in ten feet ahead  and see what i see  matt okay  liam that is a 23 for perception  matt okay you skirt up and look inside and theres a handful of trees in little clusters here  and there but for the most part this old graveyard is flat land with just stones set up  throughout the older 
town	 stones have very little rhyme or reason to their placement theyre  sporadically thrown around fresher ones tend to be more clustered with family names this  definitely looks like something that was put here when the town was founded and has been slowly  expanded over time and its not uniform  liam i hiss back at percy is this the way to your temple  taliesin whispers yes  liam through here  taliesin yes  matt you do see a little ways ahead in the center of this open barren area there is a stone  temple 
none	 that has from what little you can see a bit of stained glass pattern to it  liam do we knock  sam is it safe should we go up  taliesin we go up to the doors and give it a tug  matt okay percy walks up to the doors  liam well all right  taliesin this is my neighborhood i feel comfortable  matt okay you  sam all right papa lets go  matt you go to the doors of the temple the large wooden doors in them are carved this flaming  wreath into 
none	 the wood it looks almost like the outer ring of the classical depiction of a sun and  going across the sky where you can see the waving flames licking the sides of the actual doors and  it is a double door as you tug on the handle at the front it gives very little to you you give a  little more of a tug on it not enough to gather attention just enough to really see if its just  stuck or if its locked and it appears that the doors are not opening  liam and 
none	 i look  sam this is what he does  liam it is what i do this is an old old type of lock hold on  matt there is no lock actually  liam theres no lock oh but i rolled a natural 20 does that help let me get through the door  taliesin suddenly a lock appears utterly pickable  laughter  marisha utterly pickable its the most pickable lock ive ever seen  matt there is no lock it is barred from the other side there is some heavy wooden plank that  is currently set 
dung	 on the other side of the door  liam oh wheres grog when you need him  matt so with your expertise in these sort of circumstances you know that with the proper  placement of a long blade and enough strength and weight put at the right fulcrum point you can  probably shimmy it off and it may take a little bit of teamwork to do so  liam okay whos got a mine are all very small do you have a shortsword  sam everything i have is short i can just go in there and open 
none	 it from the inside  liam oh right i always forget  sam its not concentration so i can just jump in there  matt essentially  liam dont fuse with a church pew  matt if youre referring to a dimension door  sam correct its not concentration i dont think  matt no it is not concentration  liam more of a sneeze  matt you can visualize it it doesnt have to be a place you have seen yet  sam i can say i want to go ten feet in that direction  matt yep  
dung	 sam before i do why are we trying to get in here i thought it was to meet people i dont  think theres anyone in there  taliesin i would like to find out what happened  sam okay good enough for me i go in  matt okay spoof with a burst of dark purplish energy scanlan steps through the door leaving no  mark or trace behind on the other side you hear this muffled spoof as he reappears on the  opposite side completing his transition you appear now in the central worship hall of the 
none	  zenith temple to each side of you you can see there are windows about ten foot wide stained  glass windows about every ten feet around this pattern it looks like three to each side there  are pews set up for the masses to come and sit and worship but a lot of the pews have been pushed  off to the side set astray some have been destroyed and ruined theres a pile in the corner  of a number of sundered and tattered pews there is a red carpet that marks the center that goes  
none	 all the way to what looks like a raised altar on the opposite side of the room you can see that  some of the stained glass further down has been shattered and broken and a little bit of sunlight  creeps through you can see there is on the altar a large stone platform its hard to see from this  distance make a perception check  liam muffled scanlan open the door  sam we do have earrings 17  matt there appears to be something on the the altar in the distance small and scattered about  
none	 it but from this distance its hard to make out the details but you hear  vax muffled through the door  sam all right how big is this thing thats keeping the door shut  matt its about eight feet wide and about a foot eight feet long about a foot wide and  about six inches thick a big old piece of wooden board  sam a couple hundred pounds  matt i would say it probably weighs about 40 or 50 pounds  sam 40 or 50 pounds  matt its wood its porous  sam and 
none	 how high off the ground could i touch it  matt you could touch it it gets to about your head a little higher  sam all right im going to try and lift it off  matt go ahead a make a strength check athletics make this athletics  sam athletics hmm not good 12  matt grunting from this position its not even budging  liam all right scanlan step back from the door a couple of paces im going to stick a blade  through the door  sam its not going to do much theres a 
dung	 big heavy thing  liam im going to hold on one side youre going to hold on the other and well do it together  percy can i borrow your blade  taliesin ive never used this ive had it since i created the character and ive never used  this blade once this is the most use its ever gotten i pull out this pristine piece of shit  laughs i dont even remember i think i found it in a dungeon its terrible  matt what is it  taliesin its a boarding sword it was one of 
none	 those little curved swords  matt right a scimitar or falchion  taliesin a scimitar but short it was nothing it was terrible  liam its all we need  taliesin yeah so get it in there  liam scanlan grab some rags or something wrap it around the blade youre going to lift on your  side were going to lift on this side  sam i get the sharp side  liam i cant get the handle through the crack in the door  sam all right i feel like theres some sort of spell i could use 
none	  all right lets just do it your way  liam got that bigbys hand is that what youre saying  sam yeah ive got a million things i could do  taliesin are any of them concentration spells  sam bigbys is probably concentration but ive also got a potion of strength  matt as a note seeming isnt concentration  sam i thought it was  matt no you cast it and it lasts for eight hours you dont need to worry about that  sam no i want to follow this through  taliesin lets keep going 
none	  liam all right can we lift it together  matt laughs we can try all right so this is going to be the three of you as a skill challenge  i want all three of you to roll not athletics just a straight strength roll  taliesin one two three  matt add your strength modifier  taliesin 16  sam plus strength 12  laughter  sam wait did you get a four four we are the worst we are the weakest ones  oh i cut my hand  matt which is exactly what happens  
none	 taliesin and liam bigbys hand bigbys hand  sam im going to take damage  matt yeah first and foremost you take four points of slashing damage to your hand you pull  back and there is a line of blood now beginning to drip off your hand you shake it amongst  yourself  sam oh i cant say god damn it in here im in pelors sorry pelor  taliesin lets use a sword i want to see how this plays out  sam god bless you gesundheit pelor man all right well jeez louise  liam whip 
none	 out the purple hand man  sam seems like overkill what about a thunderwave can i do that  matt certainly  sam all right does it only affect living things or does it affect  liam wait scanlan are there any windows in there  sam there are there are windows good call  matt its a blast of thunderous energy in an area it would affect living and nonliving matter yes  liam hold on this is stupid  sam are you sure  taliesin we are going to the window we are going to the window  
tavern	 sam no lets carry this out  taliesin no we are going to the window please do not destroy the temple of pelor  sam three hours later we are still trying to open the door  marisha its not even locked its just heavy  sam i can bigbys hand ill just bigbys hand  liam which way to the window i can walk to the window  sam its up there you can make it but percy cant  liam i can probably lift that door bar from inside  sam you could probably  liam with your 
none	 help son  sam yeah but i could blast it would be very dramatic  liam lets save that for important stuff all right where is the window which way do i go  sam to the right and up  matt there are windows shattered on both sides theyre broken a little higher up so you could  either continue to break the bottom part of the window or just attempt to leap through the hole  liam yeah ill attempt to leap  matt okay so give me an acrobatics check  liam all right  sam the 
none	 saga of the door  marisha its just a door you guys its just a door  liam 25  matt 25 you get a running start leap off the side and parkour up between the actual there is  an extension to the side where another room is attached on each side of the temple towards the back  you leap off that wall onto the small pillar thats holding the side of the window and up  through the broken portion of the stained glass landing threepoint landing on the inside you  almost land in one of 
none	 the shattered piles of wooden pews and splinters and jagged pieces of wood  sticking out of it about a foot away from you and you are like oh that was close you see  scanlan across the way you see the altar to your right  sam hey oi your stupid idea cut my hand  liam builds character im going to stay away from the altar and skirt the wall all the way  around it  mat okay you get to the door  liam im going to try to help do you want to help me 
tavern	 lift this thing  sam with my good hand yes  matt have both you guys make strength checks  sam you know what im going to get some assistance i call my unseen servant to assist  matt laughs okay  sam he is going to lift with us  matt with a brief burst of wind energy a shimmering form somewhat humanoid in shape but  still amorphous appears  sam hi darrell  matt wind sounds and begins to shove itself up against the bottom of the wooden bar make your  check as well  sam 
none	 that was a six is that for me  matt thats for you and then roll and add five for your unseen servant  sam so five extra to that is 11 right no  matt roll again add five  sam oh i see four so thats a nine  matt the three of you one mystically summoned from a plane beyond your own cannot seem to budge  this single wooden door youve defeated beholders youve slaughtered illithid underneath  in the underdark deep in the belly of the planet but this door bests you  marisha man 
none	 laura and travis aint missing shit  sam all right im doing it step back  liam whip out the hand  sam all right i summon bigbys hand the mightiest hand that will ever unlock a door ever  singing bigbys hand  matt this giant glimmering purple fist appears in your vicinity it grabs the bottom go ahead  and roll a d20  liam come on  sam 12  matt plus eight to it  sam plus eight 20  taliesin how do you want to do this  matt with its finger just goes ping 
none	 and it thudding noises the door creak opens up and  percy stands there looking not very happy  taliesin was it overkill because really it took that  sam it took three spells to open this door three spells  taliesin its not overkill if you used what it took  sam three spells and i injured myself  taliesin we took damage from an inanimate object oh god get it out of our system now  sam welcome percy  taliesin oh god all right im looking around taking in the damage anything that i notice is  
none	 particularly out of whack from the last time i was here other than theyre upgrading the locks  apparently  matt looking about the place it looks pseudoransacked there has been much force used  in whatever destroyed these pews the glass that was broken was broken from the outside in so  definitely seems like there was someone throwing a rock through or a intrusion from an outside  standpoint as you walk further and look around the two rooms to the side the doors are closed  there is the altar on the top and you do see 
dung	 there is a couple of small sacks laid to the side  of the altar what looks to be some lowlit candles and there are some braziers one to each  side of the altar and one against each wall all of them appear to be long dark and out go  ahead and make a perception check  sam all of us  matt all of you  sam 15  taliesin 15  matt you both as you approach the far side of the temple towards the altar you notice the  brazier to the right is smoldering 
none	 ever so gently just a very faint glow of ember to it  liam whats the matter  taliesin reynal  sam who reynal  taliesin father reynal louder father reynal lets check one of the doors well start on the  door on the right  matt you step up you can see now on top of the altar there appears to be a couple of glass vials  that are overturned a little liquid spilled you can see bits of broken glass across the bottom  the one step that leads down from the altars raised platform  
none	 taliesin can i dip and smell  matt make an investigation check  taliesin 13  matt 13 okay looking at just the general vicinity of the altar you taste the liquid its  definitely somewhat caustic in nature you cant really determine it but just touching it to  your tongue your tongue goes numb for a second and you feel a slight burn your nostrils clear  out a little bit from the scent there is some random powders and such thatve been brushed off  you get the feeling that the way that all this was treated 
none	 it wasnt so much like it was destroyed  more than it was hastily packed up roll a perception check  taliesin 20  matt 20 okay looking about the outside of the altar you do notice that around the brazier that  is slightly smoldering there is a layer of ash there gathered on the inside of the brazier and a  little bit on the floor around its base  sam okay  taliesin someone has been working on something in here  sam it couldnt just be ash from the thing that is burning  matt if 
none	 you look at the other braziers there is no ash around it most of the ash is contained  the wood ash itself tends to fall its a little heavier this seems to be a lighter shade of ash  and its more of a has found its way out of the brazier from just the heat and the air  taliesin i want to smell the ash does it smell like some sort of is it perfumed  matt you lean down and you take some of the ash in your fingers and smell it its not perfumed  
none	 but youve had some experience with dealing with various burning materials this is definitely  paperbased ash you do also notice underneath the brazier there is one sliver of paper that was not  wholly burned  sam paper  marisha whispering paper  sam its a golden ticket  taliesin without sufficient magical essence the distillation is proven to consistently fail a  shame really i shall seek an influx of materials elsewhere before i can continue this project  regarding the weapon after a year of taking notes from eyewitness accounts my original designs were  faulty and 
none	 recently cost me my hand the wind of fortune has seen a shift it seems as sylas just  returned from emon having encountered the stillliving subject and had the pleasure of  seeing his work firsthand his unnatural eyes took in much detail i believe his observations  have brought me to the brink of finishing my design i intend to journey from whitestone within  a couple of months to gather the components needed but if delilahs hunch is correct the  subject is heading here i may find myself needing to leave sooner than anticipated  liam 
none	 theyre trying to copy your work  sam copy  taliesin why  liam for war  taliesin i want to take another look at everything that was on the altar and i want to  see if it looks  matt go ahead and make an investigation check  taliesin 18  matt testing whats there i mean a lot of the material has been scattered and mixed but there  are elements that resemble the black powder youve used in some of your constructs and tinkering in  the past  sam theyre making guns  taliesin well 
none	 we know were looking for someone without a hand  sam to do what  taliesin to find out whos trying to copy my work  sam someone who is working with sylas right  taliesin yes lets check the rest of the temple  liam yes  sam okay im going to go up on the altar was there a small something on the altar  matt what you noticed were like some of the glass vials that were overturned  taliesin whats in the pouches  matt looking at the pouches it looks like some of them contained 
none	 phosphorus some of them  contained other alchemical reagents that were used in the research but most have been emptied and  its just a residuum on the inside  taliesin checking the door on the right  matt door on the right  liam going with  matt creak opens up into what was father reynals room as the door opens youre  immediately hit with terrible smell of decay and you can see shoved under the bed that first  appears on the opposite side of the small room what appears to be the remains of father reynal 
none	  long passed and left to fester beneath his bed  sam can i tell how he died  matt youre welcome to go ahead and take a look roll an investigation check  sam 23  matt 23 looking at the body it appears that there are a series of puncture wounds  rapierbased theyre too long like stiletto too long to be a dagger  sam not teeth  matt no they are inflicted by a weapon a long thin weapon and multiple to the torso  taliesin im going to search the room for anything else search 
none	 the body  matt okay searching the body searching the room it looks like everything of interest has  been taken from the place you find some leftover stale food you find some candles that are  generally used for the purposes of worship here in the temple but anything beyond that all the  drawers have been emptied everything has been taken by whoever was previously setting up  residence in this facility  sam are there any holy symbols or anything that we might take to give to keyleth to i dont know  wasnt she gonna i 
none	 dont know do some holy shit  matt you do notice that throughout the temple there are images of pelor flamewreathed face  various sun and stars that are set up but most of them have been profaned marked on shattered or  covered in soot an intentional effort has been made to dampen the power of pelor in this  onceholy place  liam are there any untouched  matt none that are untouched but there are some that could possibly be cleaned a couple of small  medallions that are hanging up in the room where the father 
none	 lays  liam ill snag those  matt okay  taliesin i want to check the other room the room to the left  matt make a perception check  taliesin so much perception 19  sam 19  liam 20  matt all right as you walk back into the main temple  marisha finish first  matt all right your ears catch a faint distant sound like a strong wind pushing through a  mountain pass this low mournful wailtype sound  sam whats that  matt no wind is moving there is a stillness to the air 
none	  liam stepping back into the darkest shadows i can see  matt as you guys take in this sense this sound gets louder and louder at which point the air  itself gets colder and colder as you nervously exhale you can see your breath becoming visible  in the air around you as you all look at each other you stepping back into what shadows there  are as it is a very open temple as its a temple of sun  liam 32 stealth  matt you find what tiny little alcove you can of shadow its 
none	 not going to offer a lot of  protection once you move but for now you seem to be out of the circumstance  sam i grab percy and i make us both go invisible  matt okay  sam so what is that a 3rdlevel invisibility spell  matt yeah you guys both vanish holding your place on top of the altar and as that moaning  tends to grow louder and louder you can see this shimmer at the doors that are open on the opposite  side of the room it looks like a woman a form 
none	 of a woman but translucent in nature drifting in  giving off the horrible raspy groan sound as it drifts in and you see it looking around and the  features are gaunt as it gets closer it looks elven by racial nature but the eyes are just  these sunken faintly glowing sockets the hair wild and matted and floating behind it its hands  reaching out and as it gets partway through the temple it looks like its seeking something and  its eyes fall directly on you two  liam im throwing a dagger right now  
none	 matt lets go ahead and  sam ugh what if she was a good guy  liam its a banshee man  sam what if its a good banshee some of the banshees that ive met have been decent were  rolling for initiative  liam theres siouxsie and the banshees theyre all right  sam im glad i used half my spells trying to get into this goddamn place  matt off to the side there  liam he means well  taliesin he means well thats a terrible costume  matt you guys are on the altar there 
none	  taliesin you were so prepared for me to go to the temple that you built it  matt i built the whole city because i didnt know where you guys were going to go  sam jesus matt  marisha he does have a pile of maps over there  matt shh dont look at it  taliesin im not looking im not looking  marisha im just noting the pile  matt so first and foremost lets go ahead and roll initiative  liam okay  matt youll get a surprise round  liam okay  marisha dope 
none	  liam natural 20 for initiative as well  marisha you finally got a good initiative roll  sam i got a seven  taliesin i got an 11 together we can get a slurpee im weird tonight  i dont know whats up  matt all right  sam well i cant do anything  matt all right well first and foremost before anything happens this entity as it notices your  presence it begins to transform and its image becomes more horrifying as you pull your dagger  out i need all of you guys to roll a 
none	 wisdom saving throw  marisha you have advantage  taliesin i rolled a one and then a natural 20  matt laughs nice  liam 17  matt 17  taliesin thank you for the advantage  marisha youre welcome  matt scanlan  sam 11  matt with advantage  sam i also always have advantage so do i get to roll a third time  liam no doesnt stack  matt unfortunately you are considered frightened by this entity it scares the crap out of you  marisha and taliesin you cant be frightened after a heroes feast 
none	  matt ah then never mind you feel it shake your form for a second its horrible visual presence  for a second freaks you out but then you remember the knowledge that your friends are here  and you have to serve a purpose and you shake off  sam not only do i shake it off i gird my loins  matt pull them up and get ready all right  marisha just for a refresher youre immune to poison disease and fear and you have advantage  on your wisdom throws  taliesin we should do this 
none	 every time we fly  marisha its expensive  liam so do i get to attack and then move into the combat round where i got a natural 20 plus  five for initiative  matt well you go first technically its not a surprise round because the creature can sense life  and saw them before it happens so it wasnt ambushed but you do get to go first and you do  get to go before it in the use of surprise i didnt mean to use it in the surprise round  fashion these entities can detect 
none	 living creatures up to five miles away  liam so theres no sneak attack damage on this thing is there  matt if you get to it first you still have advantage  liam all right  matt because it doesnt see you youre still hidden from it  liam 15 so this is a 26 to hit  matt that hits  liam okay and this gets the sneak attack damage  matt this would yes  liam all right here we go but its not a critical hit from assassinate because  matt it is not surprised  
none	 liam its not surprised all right so thats a four plus seven is 11  plus 15 19 20 24 26 28  matt okay  liam im just going to keen dagger it three times in a row oh ive got to roll to attack so that  is a twelve plus 22  matt hits  liam okay two and that is six of damage and then natural 20 on that one that is three four  three plus seven is ten so 20 for that if its doubled for a critical hit  matt for double dice 
none	 not doubled modifier  liam oh all right so six plus 13  matt okay 13 good to know awesome so out of the shadows whoosh three daggers strike this  wailing ghost entity each dagger it punctures and you see it reacts from the impact as theres a  flash of magical energy with each hit the daggers then tumble out of its form and then blink back to  your belt side it looks like it definitely did some damage to it but its  liam you know what just to be fair i changed out all my 
none	 daggers except for one so i probably  couldnt throw the same dagger three times in a row so i think should pull back some of the  modifiers so i would pull out four because my dagger is plus two so the plus two for two  of those hits gets taken out right  matt it would actually yes  liam so four minus four  matt so minus four damage to this other guy  taliesin so truthful  sam so were fighting it with wooden stakes  matt wait so you threw wooden stakes at it 
none	 as two of the attacks  liam i threw one dagger and two wooden stakes  matt okay so the first dagger hits  liam first was the dagger yeah  matt yeah the two other stakes pass through its form without any other impact the one dagger does  return to you but the two stakes just clatter in the distance and the creature seems unharmed by  those two  liam even though they came out of the belt  matt yeah  liam all right  matt sorry  liam its okay its just wood  taliesin 
none	 you learned  matt so that ends that point the creature now swoops up to the center of you three and gives out  this horrible roar this wailing scream that bursts out in the air you feel like the wind push  you back and all of you feel like for a moment youre staring at your own death i need all three  of you guys to roll constitution saving throws  sam does our meal help us with that at all  matt nope  taliesin 11  marisha wait dont forget you have the additional  
none	 liam what  marisha 2d10 hit points on top  sam okay 16  liam 16  matt okay both of you guys you feel this chilling burst of spiritual energy blast through  your soul and you each take 14 points of psychic damage percy however as you look at it it  seems like this blast actually forces the soul from your body momentarily you immediately drop  to zero hit points and are unconscious  sam what no no he cant oh god  matt so with that you see percy eyes roll back and then collapse 
none	 onto the floor like a pile of  cold bones out percy its your turn go ahead and make a death saving throw  taliesin 11  matt 11 okay  marisha thats a good sign  matt scanlan its your turn  sam very quickly should we flee  marisha get the fuck out  liam in a little bit  sam in a little bit okay  liam without percy  marisha well get him up  matt you still have bigbys hand by the way on concentration  sam oh thats right  matt lets see how 
none	 long that lasts actually let me see how long it lasts just to be safe  taliesin we havent been there very long whispering god damn it  matt up to a minute so probably would have faded by now  sam god damn it  matt sorry what are you doing scanlan  taliesin really its the doors fault  sam shit ill just lightning bolt her him it whatever it is  matt okay so you release a bolt of lightning energy right in its direction go ahead and roll  damage for that  sam oh just 
none	 damage  matt you dont have to hit for lightning bolt it just hits everything in front of it and you have  to try and avoid it  sam oh 8d6  matt whats the dc  sam do i get my hand cone  matt it is a free action to pull it out so you instinctively hand cone cast the spell out  the bolt goes  sam so 19  matt 19 okay  sam 8d6  matt does not make its saving throw  sam great  taliesin need more d6 or are you cool 
none	  sam nope thats it i just need help counting  marisha thats good  sam 16 five 21 27  taliesin 28 29 30 34  sam 34  matt 34 points of damage the lightning blasts through her not impactful as you think it might  be this entity because it is in an ethereal state is not as effectively hit by such magics  however it does take damage  sam okay  matt okay  sam i will move back a bit away from the thing and i will oh we have people  marisha yay 
none	 percys unconscious  laura no  travis keep fighting  marisha its okay its cool  laura weve been listening in the car  taliesin okay so you know  matt scanlan you move back  sam okay and then i can as a bonus action still get a bonus  i will heal him this doofus here  taliesin i didnt do anything  matt healing word  sam okay yeah singing im bring health points back yeah you mothafuckas dont know how to  act yeah thats all i got singing take it to the bridge  matt 
none	 all right so healing word is 1d4 plus  sam yeah but maybe i should do it at a  taliesin just get me up its okay  sam just get you up okay 1d4 plus something  marisha do it  sam two plus whatever six eight  marisha i think its plus your spell level  matt healing word will be  sam its 1d4 plus five so its seven points  matt so seven hit points youre conscious but youre still on the ground face down loosely  fallen over the stuff on the altar  taliesin 
none	 i dont get my turn until next round  matt correct so scanlan your turns done vax youre up  liam all right so where is it im just going to back away from it about three steps while i pull  flametongue dagger out of my cloak  matt okay youre in this room currently  liam yeah oh that oh okay no so im going to walk thanks im going to slide up the wall  along where scanlan is towards scanlan and another thing i realized i havent clicked my  boots of haste so i wouldnt 
none	 have been able to do whoosh whoosh whoosh anyway and im still not  going to but im pulling out my flametongue dagger and now im throwing keen dagger  flametongue first one is 26  matt hits  liam and the second one is 23  matt hits  liam okay first attack gets 11  matt all right  liam and the second attack gets eight  matt all righty both daggers hitting it you see its form being impacted by each dagger hit it  still continues to come forward toward the two of you is that 
none	 the end of your movement  liam im going to without doing any dash or anything because i cant im going to move as  far as i can just going kittycorner behind scanlan walking along the wall  matt over here  liam absolutely  matt that far  liam yeah thats as far as i can get thats good  matt i think so all right that ends your turn the creature now is going to drift up to the  unconscious form or the nowconscious form of percy its going to swipe at you with its  
none	 corrupting touch since youre prone it has advantage on the attack thatll be 20 to hit  whats your ac  taliesin 18  matt 18 okay as its hand reaches down and passes through as you just come to consciousness  and you start getting yourself up you look up and feel this cold sensation as its hand reaches  through your back and seems to almost grasp your spine your whole body lurches from the impact  you take 12 points of necrotic damage  taliesin im back to zero  sam thats two  liam it starts 
none	 over  sam it does  taliesin yeah im back to zero  sam if he dies once comes back and dies again is that two  matt no he has to fail his death saves  taliesin i just woke up and went groans passed back out again  matt that ends its turn well no actually its going to start moving now its going to drift  through the rest of its movement this direction that ends its turn go ahead and make your death  saving throw  taliesin yes 19  laura yeah  travis yay

none	 bigger  matt all righty  sam i dont even know what it does  liam fingers going out the windows of the church like alice in wonderland  matt all right bigbys hand with a clenched fist deals an additional 2d8 damage  sam okay  matt so if youre going to punch it it does an additional 2d8 damage  sam yes i think  matt what are you going to do  sam im going to bitchslap it but the forceful hand so i can just push it far away from us  possibly to the front 
none	 door  matt okay i see so it does no damage but it does force its movement  sam yeah  matt okay and ill say because you did it at a higher level its an additional five feet of  movement on that so as the hand shoves toward the creature  sam it takes no damage for that  matt the forceful hand it doesnt no theres grasping hand and the clenched fist do damage  sam all right so then ill just hit it ill just hit it hard  matt okay so you bitchslap it physically 
none	 hard clenched fist go ahead and make a spell attack  go ahead and roll a d20 add your spell attack modifier  sam 14 plus what am i adding oh nine plus nine  matt 14 plus nine that hits go ahead and roll damage thats 6d8 force damage because you cast  it at 6th level  sam 6d8 i dont even know what those are thats a ten  liam they look like diamonds  sam there they go i got one ill just roll it six times  travis singing diamonds are scanlans best friend  
none	 laura no diamonds are vexs best friend  sam 24  matt 24  sam even at 6thlevel thats all it did  matt yeah as that happens the fist clenches and wham bitchslaps the back of the wailing ghost  creature as it does you hear it scream out in pain screech as its spectral form is scattered  across the air and dissipates  sam what  marisha thank god  sam what  travis i think you smashed it  marisha you killed it  liam you crushed it  sam but im so little and wee 
none	  liam lift yourself up for a victory lap  sam yes i lift myself up with bigbys hand yeah that was a great idea  matt you toss yourself up a couple times  sam whoa  travis meanwhile percys unconscious  sam oh shit percy  liam no ive got four healing potions i pour its not the best its a greater healing  matt so its 4d4 plus four  sam i will also sing for him a song of rest which is just another d6  matt if you guys are taking a short rest  
none	 sam yeah oh are we clear of danger  liam we dont know but i poured the potion into percys mouth  taliesin 4d4 plus four  matt yep you got it  taliesin four five six seven nine ten 14 yep im awake hurt but  liam i slap him twice anyway  taliesin ugh ah  liam what do we do  sam what are we doing here  liam the priests dead is there anyone else or should we head back  taliesin we should head back apparently any help i thought wed find here is obviously 
none	 gone  sam should we check this other room first before we go  taliesin did we not check the other room  sam and liam no  taliesin lets check the other room and  sam quickly though quickly  taliesin well check the other room quickly  liam while they check the room im going to go all over the altar and see if theres anything  any hidden door any trapdoor anything like that  matt okay go ahead and make a perception check  liam eh thats a oh no wait i keep forgetting thats a 
none	 rogue skill thats a 20  taliesin i was really hoping you missed that part  matt looking over the altar it appears to be smooth solid stone nothing catches your  attention you check the other room this is a small kitchen essentially for whoever was  running here would make small meals or things to delineate during worship andor just cook for its  own meals when the father was keeping  taliesin has it been used recently is it  matt it does not appear to have been used you can make an investigation check to gather 
none	 an idea  of how long its been there  sam im going to look around as well and food and stuff  taliesin 12  sam 22  matt okay you get the feeling that the last time this was used was a little under a week ago  taliesin all right  sam any provisions that we can take water food  matt you find a couple of loaves of stale bread some dried meats salted dry meats like  some jerkyish type things things that are meant to last a while there is produce here but the 
none	  produce has long wilted and gone to rot  taliesin i have theories on whos been using this space is there anything that would clue me in to  whos been using this space  matt its hard to really tell youre not too familiar with lifestyles of different individuals  whoever left the notes and whoever was dabbling with the vicinity does have a tendency towards  sciences and alchemy in ways that seemingly can blend and overlap with your specialty thats the  best you can ascertain based on the information given  taliesin now heres the 
none	 question do we leave them a sign that were here or do we hope that  they dont notice  sam well lets leave them a sign were supposed to be sowing discontent right so lets leave a  sign that someone was here and fucked up their shit do you want me to pee on the altar  taliesin no  liam i take my dagger and i go to the altar  taliesin wait  sam no dont leave your dagger its your only one left  liam i didnt say im leaving it yeah you want that 
none	  taliesin i want that  liam i start would you hand me that scrap of paper yeah  sam whoa this is our sign  liam so i start carving this is this pelor  taliesin this is not pelor its part of the crest of de rolo  laura ooh  marisha de rolos are back  liam okay so i just start scraping it into the stone with the keen dagger  matt okay and it gives a horrible screeching sound as you carve into this wellpolished stone  surface thats used predominantly for worship or when 
none	 it was given about five ten minutes in you  manage to scrape a design into it that is visually distinct against the smooth surface and does  match the design best to your ability that percy  taliesin i would also like to drag father reynal out of his room and put him at the pedestal  matt okay  liam and then before we go im going to the wooden door and i carve into the door pelor  lives in whitestone  sam thats a lot of words  marisha six hours later  liam its wood 
none	 it took me five minutes  matt okay you finish your carving seemingly without recurring incident  taliesin like to head back now i believe  matt yeah you guys make your way out of the temple back into the center of the graveyard the  sun is beginning to set the reds and purples of the night sky are starting to creep in as it just  begins to crest on the far western side of the mountain range surrounding the valley  marisha i have a question  matt yes  marisha whats the weather been like since 
none	 weve been in whitestone  matt its been spotty cloudy  marisha the sun has come out during the daytime  matt bits and pieces there is heavy cloud cover that seems to be pushing through it brings colder  weather it looks like when you first got there there was some snowfall that happened before you  arrived youve had a few days of sun but id say about half the day is cloud cover  marisha does it seem to be fairly natural weather for this time of year okay  matt and this far north too all 
town	 right you guys  liam i also grab those wooden stakes off the ground  matt okay takes you a little time because theyre amongst a bunch of other  broken wooden scraps  liam i grab a couple extra as well  matt okay you find some splintered wood you guys make your way back into the town id like  you all to make a stealth or a deception check if you prefer  sam deception please sings a ditty im just a peasant boy  taliesin 13  matt 13  travis gday sir  liam 23 
tavern	  matt okay  sam 32  matt all right as you guys are making your way back towards the tavern there is a small group of  whitestone villagers walking and having a conversation not heated but there is a sense of  desperate conversation amongst them and standing with them you can see theres an older gentleman  mostly bald long scraggly gray hair that falls past his shoulders a little bit hunched hes  wearing dark leathers and a cloak thats over one shoulder and drags the ground behind him and  theyre talking to him and 
none	 hes growling to himself and the best you can make out is theres  an argument about farming shipments and the inability to make dates and requirements he  shouts back to the remainder says listen it is beyond my control this is what has been decreed  by sir kerrion that is how itll be if you cannot provide then taxes will be pulled if you  cannot pay then there are far worse things we can take now be on your way and steps away from  the group looks over and sees a little boy and this 
none	 in the shadows skulking individual you there  taliesin yes  matt you new around here  taliesin a bit yes  matt i dont recognize you and two of the guards step forward  taliesin i suppose its our good luck then  matt whats your name  taliesin sighs reggie  matt make a deception check  taliesin fuck my life i know 21  liam my names reggie  matt then make yourself useful maybe you can make up for some of these lost crops that these  bags of shite keep saying they cant do  
tavern	 taliesin im actually supposed to be going back for a  matt i dont give a shit move on boy  taliesin yes sir  matt he grumbles and keeps on walking the guards give you a look one of them spits at your foot  keeps walking on eventually they drift aside you continue your path back to the tavern where  the rest of you are waiting the sun has now set night has taken the sky and keyleth is on the  verge of completing her ritual  laura im cleaning my nails as im watching her 
town	  taliesin im keeping an eye from the second floor i want to see how much movement in the city  there is and whether or not theres any guards by the tree whether or not the tree seems to be left  to its own devices  matt okay as youre keeping watch you notice occasionally there will be one of the zombie  giants that will lumber through the center of town theres a very specific pattern that they  tend to follow  taliesin definitely trying to memorize that  matt and you do notice a couple 
town	 of other guards that you didnt notice during the day begin to  show up theyre humanoid theyre armored they sneak around theyre humanoid but their movement  is unnatural  taliesin is there a lot of light in the town or not very much light  matt not very much light at all theres very lowlit points at certain crossroads thatve been  left up for general visibility for those who have to travel at night but you gather most people  just do not travel at night here in whitestone  laura make sure no lights are lit 
none	 in our  taliesin weve already blacked out  sam i blacked out the windows  laura okay  matt keyleth  marisha yeah  matt you finally complete your ritual sweat pouring down your brow  you have your hand on the roots  marisha can i do something something real quick for my final extra drama so as i complete the  ritual remembering that pelor and this is a sun tree im going to cast my 6thlevel sunbeam spell  as im finishing the plant growth with the last big essence  sam at night  marisha 
none	 im underground so im going to take my sunbeam and wrap it up with my druid goodness  and shove it in the tree  taliesin youre going to shove it where the sun dont shine  marisha yeah im going to kill it i dont know if its going to work or not  matt okay roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier  marisha do i get advantage on this because of heroes feast  matt i would say no because this isnt a saving throw and because what youre attempting to do is  essentially convert 
none	 a highly damaging spell into a nondamaging circumstance at the end of an  eighthour endurance match with a ritual this is going to be a difficult attempt so go ahead and  roll a d20 add your wisdom modifier  marisha i hope i didnt just fuck up by doing this  laura you got it keyleth  travis yeah you never get arrested or anything youre good  sam use the green one this is you doing greenery  marisha im so nervous  sam natural 20 easy or a six  laura oh no  marisha but 
none	 my wisdoms not bad so 12  matt you complete the ritual and release the healing energy of your plant growth spell as you  release it you begin to concentrate on the sun ray and you begin to see throughout the pieces of  earth around seeds quickly begin to germinate and small little bits of ivy greenery begin to  pierce out from parts of the earth in your immediate vicinity as this affects a large  radius there does not appear to be any sort of immediate reaction by the tree you begin to pull  back 
none	 and concentrate on the spell you release the sunbeam forward in the frustration of the lack of  reaction from the tree and the desperation to make sure some effect happens you release the full  force of the beam as opposed to the prequel aspect and you burst into some of the roots blasting  some of them apart and beginning to set flame to part of the under of the tree  marisha oh cool thats cool cool story  liam bucket of water  marisha ill put it out  matt you guys hear this explosion  
none	 laura thats right in front of i pull out my cloaks in my bag and start trying to put out the  flames keyleth what was that supposed to happen is that good was this good should i  stop i keep putting out the flames  matt you put out the flames and you notice where the fire had burned aspects of the wood there is  the black char marks across the roots where the flames touched and the area surrounding the root  is a little more of a vibrant brown color almost like a little hint 
none	 of life seemed to have seeped  into the root  marisha oh my god  matt it expands for a moment and you can see a little bit of life return to that localized  section of the tree  marisha ooh like starting a fire blows air go go can i druidcraft come on  matt as you do theres still these bits of ivy greenery this longembedded seeds through years  and years and generations of earth layering in here these longdormant seeds are starting to  come to life and spring through the earth around you 
none	 the expansion of the healthier portion of the  root begins to spread and then stop spreading and you begin to notice all the greenery  begins to immediately wither and crumple and turn to ash and you watch as the vibrant aspect of the  roots slowly drain from the bottom up like something is pulling the  life force out of the roots  laura theyre sucking the life force out of the earth  marisha i take some of that holy oil that vax gave me and i dip my finger in it and start  rubbing 
none	 it along the vines that are growing along the edge of the roots  matt you take the holy oil and place it along the roots and it soaks into the dry and in some cases  now charred aspects of the roots you wait a moment and the oil seems to almost burn off and  evaporate  sam so the ground is cursed  marisha the ground is cursed  sam well poo  travis should i try peeing on it  matt make a perception check  marisha perception check  taliesin that thing you hate doing 
none	  marisha no im good at perceiving things im just not good at reading people  sam you know what we need to do  marisha thats not bad 23  sam hydroponics no ground just grow it above  matt the pattern of decay that followed your initial attempt at reviving this vicinity all had  a very distinct downward motion of draining there was something about the ground something beneath  the tree and where you are that is seemingly taking the life force of the surroundings  laura oh my god what if the vampire thing is 
none	 right underneath us  marisha i was going to say can i still see the green being sucked down a bit  matt at this point all the life force was very quickly drained  laura can i use my primeval awareness and sense any sort of vampiric presence within our very  close vicinity  matt whats the radius on that  laura its a minute its up to six miles if i spend six minutes  matt okay so you take your time and you begin to focus and it expands as you do focusing on  vampiric 
none	 presence you feel a fair amount of presence above below and further north and  smattered throughout the city you get the sensation at this point in time that there is much  more beyond just lord briarwood that have come to be a creature of the night in this city  laura whispering thats good bad probably bad  travis maybe theyre not below the tree maybe its just the soil  taliesin the ground is tainted  marisha im exhausted  sam and taliesin lets sleep  laura were just going to sleep surrounded by vampires were just 
none	 going to sleep surrounded by  lots and lots of vampires  taliesin im going to tinker for a moment on my glove with that thing i talked about  matt okay make an intelligence check  taliesin an intelligence check  matt yeah just a straight intelligence check  taliesin 14  matt 14 incorporating this organic organ keeping it from rotting is already going to be a  feat in order to incorporate any of its natural charge essence is going to require your workshop  doing that on the go is too intricate  taliesin i just 
none	 wanted to think about it its fine  matt i mean it may be functional its definitely possible to use what you extracted from  the behir to be a way to charge your diplomacy but that is something that youll have to do in a  controlled space when you have everything at your disposal its a very delicate process to even  attempt it  taliesin i think we get it  liam ill take first watch  matt okay you all take an evenings rest  marisha im sorry i couldnt fix the tree you guys  
none	 taliesin we learned a lot  laura you even did that awesome fire thing at the end that was really really cool  marisha thanks i was afraid i was going to permanently kill it for a second  taliesin we know its not dead dead that its just tainted  sam guys i just want to say that i killed a door and a banshee so  laura really  sam yeah  laura nice scanlan  sam the door was harder to kill  travis thats some door  taliesin its okay i think i figured out what 
none	 we have to do first  marisha what do we have to do first  taliesin i think we have to kill kerrion stonefell  sam whos that  taliesin its the one that everyone hes the one managing all of the goods and all of the  farming  sam is that who they were talking about today the group  laura where is he at  sam oh sir kerrion i thought they said something else  taliesin kerrion stonefell hes in one of the three i would assume that hes been given one of  the three 
town	 mansions in town  sam you think if we find him kill him and leave his body on some sort of public display it would  sow some seeds of rebellion  taliesin i think it would be the beginning hes who everybodys afraid of  travis we could hang him in the tree  taliesin we could hang him in the tree  sam we could grog could you do something nasty to his body  travis just say the word  laura oh this is messed up  sam all right  travis do we check the mansions 
tavern	 for him  taliesin i think we ask around to see if theres a way to ask around to find out  whos in what house  sam ask around lets just go house to house and kill everyone in all of them  taliesin lets eventually yes  travis hello id like to share the news of our lord and savior my axe in your face  sam yes we could be mormons  matt as you guys take your watches and go to sleep in the cold interior and it is a cold  interior of the tavern 
none	 as the night comes through this is your first time really staying  the night in the center of whitestone even though you slept in the forest in the boughs of the  trees itself the temperature grows far colder here and even with the warm interior the windows  frost over and you find yourselves having to huddle or build some sort of small fire to even  keep a semblance of comfort to rest you all eventually go to sleep throughout your various  times i would like everyone to make a wisdom saving throw with advantage because 
none	 youre still  affected by the heroes feast  sam until noon tomorrow right  marisha 2pm tomorrow  sam yeah  taliesin 12  sam 17  marisha 25  liam 20  laura 23  travis 14  matt okay all of you wake the next morning rested as best as can be percy your entire  evening was wracked with nightmare after nightmare imagery you wish to not recall  whispers and voices familiar unfamiliar seeing yourself pulled from your physical self into the  heart of this banshee then wrest from death barely cackling in the 
none	 distance i want you to go  ahead and mark on your sheet one point of corruption  laura oh  travis what does that mean  marisha oh no  sam i dont even know where that is on the sheet  laura he could be evil we could turn evil here  matt as you wake up you find yourself wracked by those nightmares a sense of nervousness comes to  you and theres a tremor to your voice now thats uncontrollable at times of silence you find  yourself impulsively clearing your throat and with that were

dung	 light mist that is falling not quite rain but not quite drizzle  but just a mist in the air its a cold day the ground and most of the walkways and roads are a  little damp due to the moisture in the air not muddy just a little bit of a packed wetness to  it as you head over towards beyond the horizon and that lies more in the northwestern  quadrant of the city a little ways around the street from one of the noble houses so you keep a  wide berth you come to 
none	 the row of shops that bookended it before and you go to the curiosity  shop to find that the building itself is partially collapsed and ruined the door is torn off the  hinges and left to the side part of the ceiling is fallen in  sam is there a basement  laura yeah secret doors can i use a perception check to see if theres any kind of secret  entrances in the rubble at all something that leads to a cellar  matt do you wander into the building you guys are still on the outside 
none	  liam how collapsed is it  matt the whole building is still standing it just looks like the front entrance is caved in and  the doors were pulled off  laura ill just old lady walk into the building and look around  matt okay  liam ill go in with her  taliesin do old ladies lick the air  laura yeah she does this crazyeyed old lady does  liam yeah the eyes they never go in the same direction ones always to the left  and one to the right  matt looking about the 
dung	 inside most of the furniture has been broken or taken you can see a  bunch of shelves set up as this was once a curiosity shop empty anything of worth has long  been taken  sam oi grandma any yoyos in there  laura im looking boy  matt a large scattering of broken glass and a peppering of stains dark ruddy stains across the  hardwood floors you can see spattered in places occasional rat seems to crawl out in the distance  a little rat squeaking sound but there is no other sign of life within 
none	 the interior go ahead  and make an investigation check  laura ooh with no advantage right  marisha what time is it  sam oh until noon  marisha until 2pm yo  matt wisdom check not saving throw  marisha oh never mind  liam 13  matt 13  liam 13  laura that would have been an eight  matt eight okay you take a while pushing through some of the rubble checking behind the  main desk if you will as to where most purchases would have taken place the place is cleared out  
none	 and looks like its covered in enough dust to have been left here for the better part of six months  to a year  laura i cant see any kind of like door that leads to a cellar  matt glancing about you find what looks to be a small cellar door that opens up in the floor in  one of the back rooms you open it up theres a small ladder not even a staircase a ladder that  leads down in there its a small room about ten foot by ten foot that room is also 
none	 entirely  cleaned out  laura all right no yoyos here boy  sam thanks grandmama  taliesin can we use this as a base of operations in the moment then  laura but its halfcollapsed it would not be very protected  travis yeah were fully exposed  sam lets just take a walkabout and see if theres anything else around the area  travis do you want to head in one of the directions of the mansions  taliesin lets head to the closest mansion  matt okay so you skirt back towards the the crossroad the nearest 
none	 crossroad that heads  northward to the very very far northwest section of whitestone there you come to this noble  house which has a nice bronzed fence around the outside of it probably about seven feet tall with  these intricate spears affixed to the top almost in a fleurdelis type pattern but looks sharp  enough to keep anyone from trying to leap over the front gate is currently chained off with a  lock on it there is a lawn but the lawn itself appears to be frostcrusted from the evenings  moisture and cold temperature what 
none	 grass is there is very gray and dull and currently crisp with a  white frost dew is a slight hill and you do see the building itself its a very nice building  its a deep brown a lot of it appears to be like natural stained wood from the local forest  surrounding whitestone with highlights of deep green and black there does not appear to be any  immediate sign of life from the inside but there does appear to be a light coming from the inside  so even at this point in the day it 
dung	 can be dark on the interior you can see a little bit of light  coming from one of the doors  marisha is there a mailbox with a name  laughter  sam are there guards out front or anything or is it just a gate  matt its just a gate currently  sam do you want me to go in  laura what if we went to the fields and we asked other peasants how we report to whatshisfuck  keron keron  taliesin kerrion  laura kerrion  travis oh thats actually a good one  
town	 taliesin i will say chances that anybody in any of these buildings is somebody were going to want  to take care of is very high  laura so just bust on in and kill them right now  sam just whoevers in there  marisha is that actually what youre saying  liam and you went from focusing on kerrion to kicking in doors  travis are you feeling all right  laura yeah you look a little pale percy  taliesin i am a little pale  marisha its kind of like the game show problem  sam 
none	 well you know  laura are you sick does keyleth need to cast i dont know restoration on you or something  taliesin i just had a bad nights sleep thats all  travis scanlan go knock on that door  marisha do you have a fever  sam im just a little peasant boy  marisha is he running a fever  matt he is not actually hes quite cold and clammy  marisha ew  taliesin my nice jacket we can ask around see if we can manage to ask somebody without  arousing  sam is anyone 
town	 else on the street  matt right now in this particular area there is nobody on the street you passed a few folks a  lot of them seem to be traveling southward  taliesin how far are we from the temple the alcove  matt the alcove is a little further east its probably about a 15minute walk the other temple  that one is about a tenminute walk south of here its closer to the southwestern side of the city  taliesin we could take a walk to the ladys chamber and see if we run into anybody 
none	 there or on  the way and its only ten minutes out of the way  travis the ladys chamber  taliesin not as exciting as it sounds  liam you know someone there  taliesin sighs its not looking like it  sam i bet its empty i mean its a temple the other one was  travis all right but i thought we were killing somebody in this house  sam i thought so too  taliesin well get to it  sam i can just pop in there and see whos in there and pop out  
none	 laura be killed never pop back out again  taliesin he doesnt know what he looks like anyway  sam im just a peasant boy you wouldnt kill a harmless peasant boy  taliesin i think they would actually they already have  laura we saw the tree  taliesin genuine proof that they are perfectly fine killing a small peasant boy  liam what is there in the way of guards out in the open now and those giants strolling about  matt the skulking humanoids you saw last night that were wandering the streets none of them  
town	 visible you do take in that far down the road to the east of you there is a large shape looming  around the corner in a shadow stretching across the road  and you hear the distant muffled stomping noise  liam are we within eyeshot of that thing right now  matt not yet it looks like its coming around a corner at the bend of the road  a ways to the east  liam is there anyone our size any humanoid guards around  travis no  liam nothing  matt currently no  liam im 
none	 guessing the best time to sneak into any of these places is during the day  marisha do we want to sneak in though youre the only one who knows what they look like  matt its coming around the bend  marisha okay wait are the gates locked  sam lets get out of here take a walk were going to take a walk  taliesin were going to take a little walk and let it pass by lets go to the ladys chamber  liam ladys chambers anyone  sam towards the ladys chamber were not going in 
town	  liam its full of prostitutes grog full  taliesin youll see its not really that complicated  liam what did you roll  matt all right you guys dart southward across the road ducking into the alleys of the southern  portion of the road getting out of the visual range of the zombie giant that is making its way  down the road across your path heading southward you dart through the back alleys and  keeping free of the main central visual areas of the city you eventually make your way to the  corner that houses 
none	 the ladys chamber and as you guys see it  sam have we passed any people  matt if youre keeping an eye out for that yes in some of the alleyway you do pass a couple that  are holding some what looks like either scavenged groceries or some sort of food they have keeping  close to themselves  sam can i go talk to them  matt you can indeed  laura im going to come with you  matt all right as theyre both walking by keeping the hush they see you guys step in the 
none	  same alley they stop for a second looking you over give a nod  sam oi excuse me my papa sent me to send a present a gift of sorts to a sir keri kurion  laura kerrion  sam kerrion  laura kerrion  sam were just looking to see where we can deliver the gift  matt make a deception check  liam scanlans forte come on  sam 29  laughter  matt you both stop and the man gives her a look like hes trying to usher her along pulling her  arm and she 
none	 goes no honey its just a child walks up and leans forward and says if youre  looking for sir kerrion youll find him in the extravagant abode to the southeast of the city  sam the one right over there  matt no and gives you a side look for a second and says you dont want to go find the countess  there if youre looking for sir kerrion you go to the southeast look for the brick building  thats where he stays near the farming area south of us youre not from here are you  
town	 laura were new to town  sam shes blind  matt well just do what he says dont question all right  sam okay i just need to bring him this sack of presents or my papa will whip me pretty bad  taliesin tmi  matt then perhaps you could do that quickly  sam youre so pretty and clean  matt she blushes for a second goes like you stay safe and brushes the hair out of your eyes  for a second and pinches your cheek a little bit and theres a look of sadness in her 
none	 eyes almost  like what horrible fate befalls this child if hes not careful  laura i smack him on the back of the head and say lets go boy keep up  sam im her seeingeye boy  laughter  matt she rushes back to the side of the man with her and see its fine good luck and they  both dart off down the alley again  liam sam riegel ladies and gentleman he played gavroche in les mis gavroche right here  gavroche  matt on broadway literally  taliesin he is oliver twist  sam 
town	 singing consider yourself speaking oh thats a different show  taliesin i was ready i was ready  matt all right so you make your way southward to probably whats the second largest road  intersection in this city away from the sun tree square you can now see the temple to erathis  here and it is a large stone half dome amphitheater set up where its built outward to  face the actual crossroads and there is a courtyard built around it a small stone wall  about three feet tall that encapsulates this area there is a 
none	 couple of trees but there isnt  a lot of grass most of its just stonework erathis being the goddess of civilization you  know it has an interesting duality and disrespect to melora and all unbridled nature things that  are controlled and civilized are definitely her realm of expertise but as you approach like most  of the grass here its pretty desolate and dead winter is definitely making its way to this part  of the city you do notice that surrounding it there is dried ivy and just a general feeling of  solemn desperation and 
none	 sadness there are a few people scattered throughout sitting on benches  sitting in quiet contemplation some of them are clutching small holy symbols and doing a prayer to  themselves while rocking in the bench you do see within the dome there is a group of about four  people that are all sitting looking up to a man an older man with a thick white mustache and  receding white hair his gray robes hes wearing look weathered you recognize him while you  havent had too much interaction not being much of a pious man in any 
dung	 form of religion from your  history but you do know keeper yennen is the head priest of erathis here and is currently  giving the tailend of a small sermon to those here hearing him he speaks words of comfort  talking of through these dark days we must bind together as a community we have to ensure that  our livelihood and our existence is kept and we look out for our fellow man there is solace in  the friendships and bonds we keep here and best not to upset those that wish to keep us down 
none	  erathis looks over us there will be a time in which our salvation will come and he goes into  this very rallying speech and trying to lift the spirits of those around  marisha you said there was 40  matt four  marisha four right  sam but theyre allowed to assemble  matt yeah theres four around him in the amphitheater there are probably another ten or so  scattered about the various ground surrounding it just doing their own private prayer  taliesin do i have an opinion on yennen  matt yennen from your 
none	 previous experience and what youve heard is a very can be a bit  arrogant in his worship but not in a way that is considered dangerous or impactful to when the de  rolo families were in rule he does good for the people kind of a tool at times but he practices  well and he keeps the peoples spirits up for those who worship  taliesin we found him a bit obnoxious to our means and ends on occasion  matt on occasion but mostly just his personality nothing hes done personally hes  not a bad 
none	 person by any means hes just you know  taliesin hes also not a lapdog  matt yeah strongwilled in his ideas  laura can we insight check him to see if it seems like hes changed at all or if hes still that  same douchebag or if hes  matt you would have no basis of comparison you would be the only one that has  taliesin im going to walk up to the little meeting is it wrapping up right now  matt it seems like its winding down he finishes the discussion about the bonds of 
none	 community  speaks about this city sprang up from nothing but has a greater destiny to itself if not here at  whitestone one day we will all go past these boundaries these borders and create our own  cities there is hope for this and then begins to go into a couple of familiar prayers tailored  specifically to the erathis way of thinking and then finishes and everyone looks up bows their  heads for a second and begin to stand up and walk away from the amphitheater as he turns around and  begins to clear off 
none	 one of the back benches for him to sit on  taliesin im going to just walk up and start a conversation  matt okay you walk up to him he sits down can i help you  taliesin do you think theres any hope for whitestone do you think therell be a day the  people can find happiness again  matt i can say this if history has taught me anything our people are a resilient bunch there  has been much death opposition to all the free peoples of these lands and yet they persevered  and 
town	 surmounted these odds i think though to some degree a prison this town may have become  perhaps we ourselves cannot see the distant ends its easy to misinterpret the means of those that  would oppress us but we cant go too long before the world at large can see the atrocities  committed the terrible entities that walk these streets  taliesin do you think there will come a day that these people can seize freedom for themselves  against their oppressors  matt i look forward to a day in which there can be a beacon of 
none	 outside hope from the inside i  fear many wills have been torn asunder im sorry forgive my manners welcome to the ladys chamber  you are unfamiliar to me and he looks out at you guys standing at the peripheral of the  amphitheater travelers  taliesin yes  matt i fear the cold winter is looming an ill omen takes this city friends you may stay to  give worship if you will then i recommend you continue on your way there is little here but  dying tradition  taliesin i have a prayer to give  
none	 matt interesting  taliesin i pray for a day to come when outside forces can rally the people of whitestone again  that strangers may come and bring with them salvation and that the people will seize it  matt you speak in strange confidence for a traveler  taliesin look for signs keeper yennen look for signs im going to hand him a piece of  parchment  matt signs of what i might ask  taliesin salvation good day to you sir  liam act cool everybody act cool  taliesin we walk south  travis we walk 
none	 south we leave  taliesin and you know what ive left him  matt yeah as youre walking away you hear his voice call out after wait what does this mean  he pulls the parchment forward revealing the symbol of the top of the de rolo family crest  taliesin that sighs what appears dead may not necessarily be death and that with the shadow  of death over the city perhaps there is life deep underground perhaps things that appeared ended  and gone are perhaps continuing to this day and may rise again  matt go ahead 
none	 and make a persuasion check give you advantage on this  taliesin 16  matt nods his head slowly looks back at the sheet looks back at you with a discerning look  taliesin hes definitely not going to  matt oh not at all you look like a dirty peasant right now takes it and hastily closes it  and folds it and puts it in the pouch steps back over and gathers some of his loose tea leaves he  was making himself some tea and looks about shiftily calls over one of the other worshipers  and 
none	 begins talking with them as you guys walk away  taliesin lets head south  travis south it is  sam to the  laura to the house  sam to the house  taliesin kerrion stonefells stately manor  marisha so wait which mansion were we at  sam and laura the countess  taliesin countess anna ripley  marisha which mansion is that out of the three  taliesin thats the northeastern one  marisha thats the northeastern one  laura and she was which who was the countess again  taliesin im assuming if it is who

none	 looks cold and kind of slimy and hes coughing a lot  travis wow thats harsh looks cold  sam hes probably been up tinkering all night  liam who are you to talk crazy eyes  laura i know  taliesin i look like like a dirty peasant right now  laura no thats true  marisha i dont know if my i dont know if greater restoration will work  laura all right  taliesin should only take 20 minutes to get to the house shouldnt it  matt yeah approximately  taliesin were not passing anything interesting 
none	 on the way are we  sam any other safe houses potential candidates  matt i mean there are plenty of houses that currently dont show signs of life  taliesin i was thinking mostly of the barracks or the alcove  sam yes but after we kill this thing were going to need to know where to go  taliesin got some thoughts  sam thoughts we need a place to retreat to immediately  taliesin the ladys chamber  sam its an amphitheater isnt it  taliesin theres quarters theyll be able to hide us  marisha what 
town	 makes you think theyre going to hide us  taliesin hunch  sam shouldnt we have a backup plan in case they turn us out onto the street  taliesin actually my thought was if we take care of stonefell why dont we hide in his house  laura nobody will know right lets do it  sam thats a good plan they probably have some good wine  travis i always wanted to be a lord  sam all right lets go assassinate someone  marisha percy i dont mean to beat a dead horse or anything but  
none	 taliesin if it would make you feel better you can do whatever you like  but i think its just a tickle  marisha no youre sure about all of this  taliesin this has been what ive been working for for years im not going to lose i was surprised  last time ive had time to think about it im going to be all right and im keeping it  together im not going to pretend that im great but ive got a hold on it  sam they also have technology now they have weapons guns that 
none	 theyre developing it could  be a threat to many many other people  marisha well that im fine with no not that im fine with i mean im fine helping prevent  that im just more worried about your sanity than anything else  taliesin ive got a hold and i respect that if you think that im slipping youll let me know  marisha okay you followed me into the fiery abyss so  taliesin if that isnt a sign that i must be crazy i dont know what is  marisha touché ill follow you though ill 
none	 follow you to the end  sam as the oldest among us i say that hes fine  taliesin are you actually the oldest among us  sam well i assume so how old are you people  laura what  travis me  sam yeah  travis somewhere between one and 50  liam well im 27 but i dont know how old she is  matt and with that rainfall begins to hit upon the city  laura oh no  sam lets go  matt the ground immediately becomes thick with mud and sludge as you begin 
none	 making your way  through the city to the eastern side  marisha i go puddle hopping  taliesin this is not a happy place  travis low key  liam low key  marisha oh i look miserable  taliesin look wet  travis i take the dust of tracelessness to void out any footprints in the mud  liam its been washed away with the rain  matt you do it as you walk along you do some of the mud shifts behind you it can be a little  conspicuous if youre not careful  travis oh 
none	 not my normal flower girl routine maybe its like the old shawshank prison walk  laughter  taliesin the old shawshank prison walk  matt all right the alcove is a little ways north it would take some time youre pushing at  like 1030 in the morning at this point around 11am are you going straight to the supposed  homestead of kerrion stonefell  laura lets do it  liam were going straight there  laura yeah  taliesin were going straight there  matt all right you beeline it youre all getting cold from the wet rain 
none	 that is now soaked  through your clothes you make your way and this home is a deep red brick in construction this  house was not here when you lived here it looks like what house was here has been demolished and  rebuilt with sturdy masonry its a twostory building there appear to be two guards currently  set outside two regular leatherarmor looking more thugs than guards but theyre just both  keeping under the overhang at the front porch to keep dry and grimacing at the weather there is a  gate around it this gate 
none	 is more for purpose than visual presentation its a black iron nasty  jagged rustylooking gate not too dissimilar to the one that surrounded the graveyard its about  a 20foot walk from the gate entrance to the front step of the actual building itself how do you  want to approach this  taliesin lets walk around the back i think  liam as we walk up id like to trail back by grog in the rain the killings going to start  soon its not going to stop were going to protect them all of them  laughter 
none	  liam yeah big guy  travis yeah  liam all right  sam vax you have your daggers back right  liam i got them all  laura i put a couple arrows in the holy oil that we have  matt all right each holy oil is essentially three  laura oh can i just dip one arrow in then  right now  matt mark that off from one of your holy oils you have one of three uses of that and that that  arrow does have a holy oil essence  sam percival if we 
none	 get in there what are the chances that this gentleman sir kerrion  korean  taliesin you can mispronounce his name its fine  marisha sir north korean  taliesin sir starbucks yes  sam sir starbucks what are the chances that hes going to be in a coffin sleeping  taliesin 5050  sam okay all right good to know  travis would it be worthwhile to maybe say that the little boy and the old lady were caught  hoarding crops and we brought them to this guy see if we can draw him out of his house 
dung	  sam ooh thats a cool plan i like that plan  marisha it is raining  sam oh wait but i would be bait  travis yeah  sam okay fine  taliesin lets take a long walk around the house to see if theres a way in through the back  travis okay  marisha its dark its raining  taliesin and i cant imagine that many people attempt to infiltrate this house  liam how dark is it  matt i mean its overcast but its getting closer to noon even though you cant see the sun 
dung	  and it is dark clouds overhead it is still a general universal storm light darkened daylight  travis once around  marisha does it look like its going to pass soon  matt no it looks like its probably going to be here for most of the day at the very least  sam the rain will dampen the screams from inside so we go around once once around  matt okay perception checks all around  sam perception check  liam im looking specifically for ways in the building other than the front door  sam im looking 
none	 for clouds because i rolled a two  travis four  taliesin 21  laura 24  liam 20  marisha 21  matt all right i will say above 20s you guys notice there is a cellar door outside the building  that descends beneath it theres no indicator as to whether or not its attached to the house or if  its just an exterior cellar that you can enter from the outside you do also see there are a  number of windows around the household that are all currently closed that lead into the interior  
none	 youre uncertain if theyre locked or open theres a little bit of light from the inside  marisha like candlelight  matt like candlelight or lantern light the darkened exterior has made most of the sunlight  that would warm a building or light it up from the inside has been cut off by the rainstorm so  there is a necessity for internal lighting  marisha is there any sign of windows that are blacked out  matt no but you do notice that one of the windows to the far back side of the building where  most 
none	 of the lights coming from occasionally the light does seem to shift or a shadow moves past  it theres movement within that room nearish that window  sam theyre watching tv  laura probably i cast pass without a trace on all of us  sam ooh thank you  marisha are we going through the cellar  sam is our meal still affecting us  taliesin until two  sam yes lets go in quick  laura is it possible to see what the movement is who it is inside that window  matt not from this 25 
none	 to 30foot distance from the building and you guys trying to be  inconspicuous  liam theres nothing between us and the building  matt there is the gate the gate and what looks to be a few rocks and a couple small trees that  are on the actual grounds of the house surrounding it  laura is the cellar door hidden from view of everything or is it out in the open  matt which one  laura the cellar door that we saw  matt the cellar door is out in the open buttressed against the back 
none	 of the house its up against  the ground on the side it has two doors that open up and lead into the cellar below  laura does it look like anybody can see us  matt from where youre standing no youre going to be hardpressed to get across without being in  sight of somebody if someone were nearby  marisha were between a fence right  matt youre on the outside of a fence  travis do we want to try to draw them out or get to the cellar either way those two thug guards  
none	 are going to die  marisha there are guards  laura and sam theres two guards  matt theyre currently not in visual range of you theyre guarding the front of the building  you guys moved around back so you dont see the two guards currently on the  opposite side of the house  travis whats the fence made out of is it the speary shit  marisha is it poky up top  matt it is poky yes  travis it is poky  matt its not super sharp poky but theres iron rods  travis so 
none	 i could throw scanlan over  liam if you roll a two you can get hurt  matt yeah if you rolled poorly its going to deal some damage  sam should we do a diversion for the guards  laura they cant even see us though  sam yes but once we go through the fence they might i dont know  all right you want to sneak in  taliesin lets try to sneak in and leave the guards there unless they notice us and then well  just thwip thwip  sam all right sure  travis 
none	 how do we sneak in past them  taliesin you want to try to pull one of the wrought irons off maybe  travis id be down for that  sam if i puffed some smoke would it draw attention to us  taliesin yes  sam okay then never mind  taliesin its raining we can make a little noise itll be okay  liam where are the guards in the front  matt theyre currently on the opposite side of the building if you guys are looking at the back  theyre in the front of the building 
tavern	 guarding the front door  liam inside the gate at the house  matt correct  marisha want me to heat up that metal bar for you  liam we still have to go over and in  travis sure  laura lets just up and over the bar athletic it acrobatics it  liam grog can you bend that shit open  matt your donkeys still there beside you  laura fuck  liam yeah well if grog can frigging make a hole in there  travis can i try and lou ferrigno those bars  matt youre more 
tavern	 than welcome to go ahead and make a strength check  marisha the bar that hes  taliesin lou ferrignoing  marisha  lou ferrignoing im going to cast heat metal  sam is that going to burn his hands  marisha put on some gloves  travis i dont have any gloves  marisha spit in your hand a little bit grip and bear it  sam its raining itll be fine  matt so you cast heat metal on the bars and a certain area of this gate begins to glow with a  dull orange to become 
none	 a brighter orange and portions of it going whitishhot in places  sam why dont you just hit it with something  laura wrap your hands  marisha you can use your axe  matt the rain by the way is puffing against it and evaporating as it  impacts the nowheated metal  sam but thatll be loud  marisha you do you you do you grog  travis i rolled a 23  matt 23 okay you reach over and grab it your hands smoking on the use the pain use the pain  and pull down the 
none	 bars you get a large portion of the gate to actually bend downward into an arc  causing the whole gate to fold inward on that side making it much easier for anyone to pass  through however you do suffer nine points of fire damage from the burn and your hands are  currently scalded  taliesin now we can get trinket in  liam thats a hangnail on his pinky toe  travis its all right  marisha i go ahead and i cast healing word on his hands  matt okay so its 1d4 plus six shes 
none	 rolling it  marisha ooh 11  travis hey back to full  matt so the scarring stays for a bit you do smell the burning flesh but theres no lasting  wounds on your hands  taliesin you can check to see if theres a lock on the cellar door  liam yeah sure  travis we gotta make it across the lawn first  laura well were in the back of the house  liam well were all just walking very quietly  laura were stealthing  matt so everyone make a stealth check  taliesin we have 
none	 advantage  matt no everyone gets plus ten to their stealth you have disadvantage  on the stealth check though  sam plus ten  matt yes plus ten to your stealth roll  sam 17  travis 23  liam 34  laura 32  marisha 34  taliesin 26  matt all righty you guys all keeping low and quickly darting across the grass field you make  your way pattering across the somewhat slick grass the rain is a little warmer than the frost  that kept the grounds frozen as the morning came to so its 
none	 a little slick but you make your way  to the back of the building youre still loosely out in the open in a weird way so you dont want  to be out in the open for a long period of time this isnt a safe place youre currently  apparently made it to this side of the building unnoticed but you dont want to stay here very  long because you are visible to anyone whos on either side of the gate exterior  liam im going straight to the cellar door  laura up against the wall 
none	 of the building  liam i give it a little clunk to see what i feel  matt it is locked it does gives resistance  liam i get to work  marisha do your thing  laura i feel like its been a while since youve done this  liam did what  laura lockpicking  liam i already did it earlier when you werent here 14 thats 27  matt 27 you reach over without even looking you grab the lock youre familiar with this kind  of lock clicking you take the lock off the chain the 
dung	 chains fall loose against the opposite  side of the or the inside of the door you pull it open its dark inside you can see the dry  stone steps that lead down below the building as rain starts darkening them with drops that are  hitting them  liam i lean my head in really fast and just see if i can hear anything and roll a one  laura could i stealth in a couple of steps look around and see if theres anybody in there or  hear anything  matt okay make a perception check 
none	  liam no i said its good its good lets go right you agree were never wrong  laura 19  matt 19 listening to the inside the smells a little musty like a cellar youd expect but a  little bit of dust and untouched earth theres nothing down there no movement no sound  laura its clear lets go ish  matt you all drop in darting into which is good because you notice around the corner one of  the giants is turning the corner you all dive inside close the cellar doors bringing you to  
none	 the interior  laura i wonder if theyre going to notice that fence  sam they might  matt you hear the pattering of rain across the wooden doors of the cellar you made your way down  underneath and it is pitch black there is no light source down here  liam i pull out my flametongue dagger  matt okay a little bit of flame causes enough candlelight to see the surface  and it is a wine cellar  travis i have darkvision  marisha ill go ahead and use my flaming hands  matt okay so 
dung	 with an instant of will all of a sudden flames burst around  no audio  matt  is a small ladder in the corner that seems to lead up to a latched door that leads to the  interior of the house  laura i got up to it and listen  matt make a perception check  laura i dont hear anything you guys i think its fine  liam my ears are bigger than yours let me have a listen get down  laura yeah your ears are huge compared to mine  liam definitely look at 
none	 them  matt your sister assures you she heard  laura theres nothing there  liam i dont hear anything either i think we should just bust in  sam okay  travis wait  taliesin whispers quietly  marisha wait hang on grog just said wait  liam i keep forgetting the rogue skill so really i rolled a 20  sam wait what you rolled a three and it becomes a 20  liam for perception i can no longer roll lower than ten unless i roll a one but if its a two  or nine its 
none	 actually a ten for me  laura thats awesome  matt rogues are pretty cool  taliesin thats crazy  laura yep rogues are awesome  travis rogues are whatever  matt so you put your ear up to it and listen carefully and you hear pacing footsteps creaking  against wood no more than maybe four feet away from you  liam is that one person  matt one person stops and then moves again then moves again almost like theres pacing and you  hear low voices its a conversation theres two voices you hear one voice very 
town	 muffled but it  seems to be similar to the voice of the gentleman that came across you guys on the street that  actually briefly talked to percy the day before  liam the old guy the balding guy  matt the balding guy with the long stringy gray hair  liam hes just reporting in hes his frigging money collector  matt the other voice you dont recognize and its too muffled for you to make out anything  about four feet from you not over the cellar but off a ways to it youre not certain where 
none	 this  doorway leads to the level of muffling you can hear through the floor leads you to believe that  theyre not directly above you  liam not directly above all right theres nobody right above us  but theres people in the house  laura they might be close  travis just to be clear  liam no theyre on another floor or in another room  travis before we start were killing everything right  taliesin yes  travis okay good do we want to send one person out sneaky and then have a code word like 
none	 cheeto  if it all goes wrong  marisha last time we did that it went really well  travis did we do that before  liam no we didnt send anyone i just  taliesin lets just go one room at a time  sam one room at a time we have to get up  through this latch  and theres people right above us  liam scanlan you or me you want to go invisible or do you want me to creep in  sam i think you should have some fun too but before we do 
none	 anything do you want me to send a  cloud up there of gross smoke to smoke out the area  liam and taliesin no  taliesin lets not let them know were here  laura wait before we do this keyleth can you maybe make the gate outside not look like its all  bent to shit  liam zombie guards arent going to giants are stupid  sam itll be fine  liam theyre stupid i mean there are the guys out front  laura yeah  travis its fine  sam what could go wrong this is 
none	 a stealth mission well be in and out of here in six  minutes if we do this right lets go go go  marisha wait are you going in are you infiltrating  liam ill go up and see what i see just above us not far away  marisha i touch vaxs shoulder and i cast enhance ability and im going to give you dex saves what  do you want  liam im good on that  marisha what do you want advantage on  liam not dexterity constitution im feeling a little weak  marisha all 
none	 right constitution  matt whats this for  marisha enhance ability so i think its called bears constitution or something weird  matt advantage on constitution checks those are different from saving throws  laura oh  marisha checks  matt but it does give him 2d6 temporary hit points but those do not stack with the current  temporary hit points you have constitution would not be of much benefit to you  travis we could just set a fire down here  marisha okay do you want dex or anything  liam im pretty dexy already  marisha 
none	 instead i say good luck  sam bonne chance vive la résistance  travis all right  liam im going to check and see if it gives at all or if theres anything to it  matt creak it gives  liam it gives all right so im going to go up  travis invisible or not  liam no stealthing up all right so okay hold on i get advantage 23  laura wait no plus ten because pass without a trace  liam oh 33  matt 33 you move it up without a sound dart up catch 
dung	 yourself and lower it down carefully  dark interior you use your flametongue dagger to look inside you are inside of a closet of some  kind a ten by five closet there are coats and outfits around you you can push them aside this  looks to be like a small storage room that has been repurposed as a closet of some kind  liam i am listening intently and feeling through as many pockets as i can find around me  matt easily enough as you put your ear to the door they are talking immediately on the 
none	 other  side of this door you are a room adjacent to it you do manage to pocket from a few of the coats  about 47 gold pieces in total  marisha who leaves that much in their coat pockets  travis dead people thats who  liam can i make anything out through there  matt you make out conversation it seems to be between a voice you dont recognize and the  gentleman earlier you met basically saying with everything thats going on now its honestly  very frustrating that these people wouldnt do their share of 
none	 the bargain i myself ive been  doing my best to keep them in order but at this point in time i think we need to do another show  of strength in order to keep them working as hard as we have been another voice calms him down and  says dont worry dont worry keep it under control at the very least we should have to be  ready prepared if what lady briarwood says we should be having visitors any day now and i would  hate to be caught flatfooted so were going to go ahead 
none	 and gather our arms going to make sure  that we outfit the place the best we can traps alarms whatever is necessary to make sure that we  are not caught offguard  laughter  marisha this is about to be hilarious  matt you guys came at just about the right time  liam id like to everybody hold  sam hold  laura hold  liam i just want to wait for one minute and see what progresses  matt okay the conversation continues the older gentleman begins talking about i dont like the  idea of 
none	 there being any sort of conflict on our home turf i wish they would just meet them out  head them off cut them off at the head why did we invite them in here that seems to be a  dangerous circumstance  liam while theyre talking i say weve got two gentlemen up here  sam two gentlemen  laura okay i start climbing the  liam i think its time to start killing  sam grog up first  marisha places everyone places  laura grog up before me  travis its opening night and im so 
none	 excited  laughter  matt stealth checks all around  laura plus ten  liam send up the goliath  marisha thats good  travis 29  sam 18  laura plus ten  sam that was plus ten  marisha 32  taliesin 28  laura 34  matt all righty you all slowly make your way up theres not enough room for all of you inside this  room this storage space  laura grog first  matt grog you go up you push open the door into the next room and it is a for lack of 
dung	 a better  term a music room theres a few couches around theres a piano set up  liam oh it went closet to music room  matt yeah  marisha oh were opening the door  matt you guys are opening a door to a room next to the wall you were listening to is the room  next to you this opens up into a room adjacent  marisha a music room how regal  matt so as you push out into the room its dark in here the only light thats coming in is from  the 
none	 nearby window a little bit of suns coming through from the rainstorm you can still hear the  rain pattering on the window and the second floor above you there is no sound from the rain hitting  the roof from this distance  liam dart my eyes around is there anything thats useful in here  matt not particularly its mostly decorative few vases some books on the shelf there is a  door that is partially open that leads into hallway a hallway  that seems to connect the two rooms  liam which way are the voices 
none	 coming from  matt yeah the door is the opposite of the window and the room that youre in is adjacent to the  room that the voices are coming from the closet is in between the two  liam oh between the two so it is out door hallway  matt yes out door hallway and then the room where the speaking is coming from  sam do you want me to create a diversion of some sort no  laura just run in surprise him  sam are we going to go around  liam so were stealthing 
none	 right  matt yeah  liam so i pull both of their hands and i say  sam whos they  liam grog and keyleth i start pulling them through thats all right out the door along  the hallway towards the voices  matt all right  taliesin matt thats a lot of maps you have down there  laura really really im offended and im hurt  marisha i look back at vex and i just go  laura i give you the worst evil eye ive ever given anyone  liam too bad ones going that way 
none	 and the others going that way  sam as they go i quickly lock eyes with grog and i give him a quick little inspiration  singing blood glorious blood grogs  about to take some dead dudettes and dudes  grogs about to make some  laughter  matt all right so take a d10 inspiration die so the three of you move on ahead the rest of  you trinket is unable to climb  sam oh can i trinket stay  laughter  laura i smack the back of your head again and its hard because im 
none	 angry right now  travis do you have any of your rings on turn them inside and impact noise  marisha its the mom slap exactly its the grandma backhand  matt all right the three of you stand at the double doors you moved around to the hallway is  there a change to this arrangement that you would like you currently have grog vax and keyleth at  the front and three of you in the back  laura yeah i want to stealth in behind grog after they go into the room  matt all right so 
none	 there you are ill put you on the side of the door there you hear the voices from  the other side of the door conversing and talking back and forth scanlan percy  marisha oh my god someone say something cool  matt whats the plan  liam i put my hand up in the air  sam de rolos roll out  liam and i click my boots together click feel that adrenaline rush  travis i rage  liam and i kick the door as hard as i can and go right in  marisha taliesin and 
none	 sam scream and cheer  matt impact noise the door swings open both of them slamming into the sides of these two  bookcases immediately you see behind the desk here and standing in the center  liam its kiefer sutherland  matt you see the older gentleman in these long robes immediately spin his head and see  essentially a troupe of armed villagers peasants dirty faces come rushing in all fucked  up eyes and all rushing into the room they both turn looking completely caught offguard by this  you do also see in the room there 
none	 are a few guards that are just waiting off to the side  theres a couch area theres a fireplace  marisha of course damn guards  matt you guys get a surprise round  marisha thats right  matt so lets go ahead and roll initiative to get the order of things here  travis advantage on initiative because i have that thing  sam are you alert do you have alert is that what it is  travis i have feral instinct  sam ooh  travis which i forget sometimes thats better  sam and laura sing 
none	 with the battle music  matt all right so 25 to 20  travis 20  taliesin 23  matt all right 20 to 15  sam 16  laura whoa look at you scanlan  sam better figure out what im going to do  matt so scanlan is 16 15 to ten  liam 13  laura 13  marisha 13  liam halfelves  matt ten to five is that everyone  laura thats all of us  matt thats everyone yeah  marisha bitches gonna die  matt all righty first surprise round from all of 
dung	 you guys catching them offguard  up first is percy  marisha percy  taliesin im going to pull into that empty oh ive got a button dont i im going to pull into  that corner right there  matt over here  taliesin and im going to take two shots at that soldier in the corner that guard  matt okay the guards you can see are wearing dark studded leather armor no cloaks both have  rapiers or stilettos daggers on their sides they look at the sudden intrusion and begin going for  their weapons you 
none	 caught them off guard  taliesin 22  matt 22 does hit  taliesin thats just a d10 where are my d10s thats nine points of damage  matt all righty  taliesin another shot to him  matt all righty  taliesin thats a misfire im going to do a quick repair and thats fine  matt does the repair take an action  taliesin no it takes a  matt okay so youre fine it does not break cool thats your turn one shot off the blast  rings out as you fire the pepperbox it misfires and 
none	 you quickly throw one of your tools in the  air catch it and with one swift movement you unblock the passageway click it back up into its  place out of the corner of your eye you turn and for the first time in five years you see  standing behind the desk sir kerrion stonefell visually nearly the same as the last day you saw  except maybe a bit of white on the sides of the hair armored with a nice set of relatively  ornate leather armor blue hues and blacks the hair itself is this 
none	 tousled brown theres a  boyish charisma to him if he wasnt such an asshole and the moment you see him theres this  boiling rage from within just to have that moment of sight  taliesin if youre lucky you die last  matt theres a look of complete confusion as he has no idea who any of you are you look like  paupers that literally burst into his office that ends your turn percy grog youre up  travis i hear him say that he has to die last and in my rage i race forward to 
none	 that fuck in the  middle of the room and i swing my firebrand warhammer at him twice  matt all righty  travis i would make to make this first one a new feat called great weapon master  matt all righty  sam what does that do  matt minus five to hit  travis im going to use my no not on that one that misses  matt what did you roll  travis a two so thats 11 yeah that misses  matt that definitely misses as you swing in nervous yell just ducks out of 
none	 the way and even  though hes older he reacted pretty quickly your weapon slams into the ground splintering some of  the wood you peel back for a second attack  travis that makes me even angrier and now ill use inspiration 18 minus five 23  matt 23 does hit plus ten damage  travis okay plus eight is 13 17 27  matt 27 points of damage ooh  travis plus four for the fire damage but still the 27 total  matt so as he ducks out of the way you bring up the hammer a 
none	 second time and whack smack him  right square in the chest grunts the wind escapes him for a moment and the flames lick  across the front of his chest he catches himself on the table between the sofa and chair behind  him gets back on his feet looks to you for a second and pulls out two short swords  travis thats the best thing you could have ever done  matt i dont know who you are but youre going to regret this  laura what does grog look like  matt grog looks like an 
none	 oafish butcher tubby on the sides an oldish middleaged looking man  scruffy beard scanlan does his best on that one whatever other visual you want to  sam potbelly  matt huge potbelly grog that ends your turn  travis yep  matt all right in theory it is a surprise round so you may have had advantage on that  first strike so go ahead and roll it  travis screams 26 minus five is 21  laura 23 no youre right  travis yeah 21  matt roll damage again well say this is an additional third 
none	 strike in reaction to him pulling  his blades out  travis 32  sam jesus god  matt wham the hammer slams him a second time and he almost drops his weapons the actual end  table hes resting on shatters beneath him and he grunts has to get back up onto his feet looking  genuinely fearful now that ends your turn  travis you dropped your toothpicks  matt scanlan youre up  sam okay so hes been attacking the old guy  matt correct  sam those two flanking the big boss are just guards right 
none	  theyre just standardissue guards  matt best you can tell theyre both in studded leather armor they dont look like guards like  armored they look like thugs that are essentially there to watch  sam all right well im going to run in the room  matt about how far in  sam make a left im sorry turn right away from the action and then ill look at the guard  behind and to the right of the big guy  matt that guy there  sam the good guy the bad guy  marisha you got
