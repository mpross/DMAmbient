all righty well then without further ado lets go ahead and dive into tonights episode of  critical role  dramatic music  liam me daddy  matt little late on the draw there bud  marisha like unfashionably late  /none/ liam what an accident that was oh no  matt welcome back so last we left off vox machina had made their way through the innards of  the undead risen primordial earth titan on its shoulders was held the longabandoned until  recently city of thar amphala from the shadowfell a city that once held the armies of  vecna the undying king who has since risen once more and achieved godhood in recent days  you traversed to this titan through its innards up into the city of thar amphala which you notice  the outer wall currently /none/ manages to maintain an arcane dome that holds at bay any of the outward  assailing forces of the wyvern riders or devossa the brass dragon where the inside of it contains  in wait a cloud of various gloomstalkers and a skeletal dragon that just peruse the city in  safety as you make your way through the streets in search of the recently reassembled and standing  tower of entropis  now upon seeking a sword that you were notified had historical binds to the hatred of vecna and hopefully  his downfall the sword of kas you /none/ went seeking this weapon long ago discarded and bound within a  buried catacomb within a pit of acid along with various corpses left over from an ancient war and  in doing so unfortunately notified vecna of your arrival as vex passed through into the ethereal  plane the ring that kept any sort of scrying at bay was lost and both vax and keyleth came to his  attention all of you managed to flee back to scanlans mansion where the rest were in wait  however with a notification fresh at hand the skeletal dragon swooped into /none/ the chamber where the  mansion was set on its back riding lady delilah briarwood and the rerisen sylas  briarwood  the mansion was dispelled you were exited from the pocket plane and barely maneuvering due to  a very lucky roll having your plane shift dispelled you made your way into the feywild as a  hail mary and through a dickdrawing made contact with the one archfey that you had  encountered in your previous journeys artagan upon being summoned and your knowledge of the  strange timealtering nature of exiting the feywild you asked if it /none/ was within his power to  ensure the condensing of the time passage when you were to return he agreed under two conditions  one when this was all said and done you would help him assemble a doorway in the prime material  plane in which he could visit your space and two upon realizing that vax was of some undying  or rerising nature wished to strangle him until dead you agreed and shortly thereafter vax  expired into ashes and you all spent time awaiting his return  weve left off with the return of vax but /none/ if theres anything you wanted to do over that  period of time before his arrival now would be the time to do it  sam before his arrival  travis when he walks back  laura so that we can do some spells that will be in effect for a day potentially  sam but he takes a while to come back  matt it takes a little while yeah  laura so we should do some of our spells right before we go to sleep  sam yeah for sure is that now  laura i dont know /none/  sam is sleep now  matt thats up to you  laura we do need to do heroes feast i have one chalice left  ashley but then vax wont be in the  laura unless we leave him a plate  matt well the meal appears for a short time  laura then we need to do that right when he gets back  marisha right before we sleep  laura yeah hopefully hell be back before  sam well wait a few hours  laura well wait a few hours to see if he shows up and /none/ then well cast it to see because we need  time to be able to do it  matt well say for the truncating of the wait period that eight hours go by 12 hours go by  its hard to tell time in the feywild since it doesnt have a daynight cycle its always on the  cusp of sunset and the longer you wait and the more the boredom sets in the more the stress of  the coming fray creeps into the back of your mind you find that it seems like far too much time has /none/  passed and you begin to worry you begin to twitch you begin to do search parties around the  surrounding forest the possibility that he returned and got lost you dont know how much  time has passed until you convene to desperately ask if there was any possible sight and at that  point you hear the snapping of foliage beneath a distant foot and you all turn and by the nearby  tree you see entering the pale nude long darkhaired body of vax returned in his revenant  form for a second time  travis yep /none/ thats him  liam that was a thing does anyone have my clothing  laura yes  travis no they took it and ran it was part of the penance we fought bravely its buck naked  from here on out  liam thats going to make tomorrow a little squirrely  marisha scanlan awkwardly put it in a weird druid circle rock thing its over there  sam we were protecting it for you  marisha he doesnt know how to do druid circles really right  sam the goddess ioun told me to protect it in a circle /none/ reminiscent of the circle of my third eye  marisha whispering i dont think hes telling the truth  liam do you have all my shoes and glasses so i may have them  sam as ioun wills it yes  liam okay could you lead me and my penis towards them now  sam ioun be pleased i will  liam were still standing here its getting awkward  sam im a holy man its supposed to be awkward  laura im going to start the heroes feast im just going to get the chalice  taliesin ill help /none/ with that that sounds like a great use of time and not watching this  travis i have a question should we ask the sword of kas since its fought vecna before does it  know of any weaknesses  laura thats actually really smart wow thats really smart grog  ashley oh good idea  taliesin dont think too hard about it  sam we cant hear him so youll have to talk hello  travis sorry  laura that took a lot out of you  travis i need to sit  taliesin grog i have an idea /none/ why dont you ask the sword if it has any idea of vecnas  weaknesses  travis gasp thats a good idea percy  taliesin im so glad i had it  travis oh my god yes wait wait if i pull it out of the sheath to talk to it can i talk to it  through the sheath  matt you probably have to draw it  travis i might have to draw it and then its going to need the glugging  laura here  travis you  laura you can cut me  travis look listen /none/ i made a promise to your brother he was very adamant that im supposed to  stick it  taliesin ill take it its my turn  sam percy what a tough thing for you to do  travis do you want just a hand slice or do you want to up the ante and i stick it in your thigh  i do have to bathe it it has to be quite a coating  laura just do it well heal him up  travis okay cool come on percy buy the ticket baby so can i unsheathe kas /dung/  matt as you pull the blade out theres a very silent glass against textured metal sound the  blade is so dark that barely any of the light seems to come across it where the blade is up  close you can barely make out the outside of it but as soon as you draw it the voice goes  hungry  taliesin all right just on the count of three  travis do i get to pick where okay i reach around to the back of his knee and i pull along there  laura back of his /none/ knee are you trying to take him out of commission for future fights thats  really terrible  taliesin i said yes  laura i want to cast cure wounds at third level on percy  travis yeah when you shave your legs the back of your knee is the tricky part right  taliesin its just so i can swim faster that was not for you to advertise  matt as you deal with the nearly hamstrung self that is your right knee the sword is coated well  enough in percival blood as it seeps into the darkened /none/ blade and the voice goes ah yes  travis respectfully kas i had a few questions because i am on board to satisfy your maniacal  desires to fuck up vecna and all that he stands for right oh no kas  matt yes  travis oh thank god might need more blood soon do you know of any weaknesses that vecna has or  opportunities that we could explite  matt he is more intelligent than most but his arrogance gets the best of him he likes a show  travis apparently hes really smart and is arro aromatic /none/  laura he smells  marisha enigmatic  liam acrobatic  marisha what does he mean  travis he likes to put on a show i think  laura he likes to put on a show  travis yeah  matt he builds webs of plots so many things intertwined  travis doesnt make much sense apparently he builds whips out of plots  matt cut the threads and the web can falter  travis oh right he strings things together like a web you know like a dog makes  laura oh thats smart okay  matt i can /none/ cut these threads bring me to these threads bring me to him i must cut him down  now now  travis yeah oh god hes really adamant about cutting the webs  sam hes a sword he cuts thats his thing  marisha wait cutting webs  travis yeah i guess vecna has spider abilities protip  laura okay thats interesting we didnt notice that before  travis any physical weaknesses or things that he is vulnerable to that we should know  matt me  travis him okay cool i think weve got everything  marisha hes vulnerable /none/ to oh to  travis to him  marisha got it i got what they got  travis all right next time i pull you out in the light it will probably be to kill vecna or someone  that i dont like  matt as you put it away you hear a sigh  taliesin youre actually going to pull that sword out and it will have committed suicide  travis hows your knee is it okay  taliesin its feeling much better thank you  liam should we maybe talk out our plan for the moment  sam /none/ sure that sounds fun  liam no it doesnt but i do think we should probably have at it weve got the trammels  grogs got them  laura so sylas is back  marisha along with delilah thats fun  laura so my blessing from pelor  marisha hashtag blessed  laura hashtag blessed gives radiant damage to anything evil that attacks me with a spell thats  pretty neat huh i have a feeling radiant damage is going to be really important in this fight  marisha i recently was able to attune to this armor that i /none/ havent been able to attune to for a  long time and now im resistant to spells so thats good  laura what  marisha yes  laura youve just been wearing it and its not done anything  marisha kind of well i had to attune to my ring and my antlers and then i got the staff so i let  that go but now i just wore it for long enough  liam what are your three attuned right now  marisha i have four because i took a feat when i leveled up yeah thats pretty /none/ dope  travis i got a whole bunch of more hit points  sam whats a hit point  travis its like i dont know but i was thinking i have all three trammels right and i  need to get real close to do anything to vecna is it stupid for me to have all of them  liam yes it is we need to spread those out we need to decide who is doing what at least what we  think is going to happen i think i should take one of the trammels  laura youre speedy /none/ of course  marisha and i think its smart if pike and i dedicate a decent amount of our spell power to  freedom of movement right before we go in  taliesin that wont be necessary for me but for the rest of you  travis so we dont get paralyzed  sam if vax has a trammel and grog has a trammel who has the third trammel  liam one of these two  laura i could do it  sam someone who can fly you can fly  laura i have a broom after all but pike /none/ can fly now too  sam dont you have to be super strong to use these trammels  marisha pike is super strong shes a monstah  sam no im fine with that can she fly  laura she can fly  ashley i can now  sam how  ashley well its for ten minutes  sam thats all well need  laura ten minutes is a long time if its right at the beginning of the fight  sam but thats when well need to use the trammels  matt giant wings  laura its pretty tight oh /none/ my god you can fucking fly  travis i reach over to pike i spin her around are there any wings on the back  matt no  ashley i dont know where they are  travis i dont know how to break this to you theyre not there yet  sam sometimes theyre on the ankles  travis i turn her upside down look at her feet  matt no wings  travis i turn her back just keep wishing theyll grow in okay  ashley oh thank you grog  laura so do you think youre stronger and /none/ youre more proficient with actual melee weapons right  because i dont think i can shoot a trammel from my bow  ashley i feel like id be pretty proficient because it takes the strength to do it ive got it  laura okay lets have pike hold the other one so pike youre the third and we have to protect  our cleric  sam what are all of us doing im praying into a book  laura fighting  sam sure  matt to give you a mechanical idea based on what ioun had notified you the more /none/ damaged vecnas  avatar form is the lower the dc to drive a trammel into the body  laura oh so we got to bloody him up and then  matt possibly or roll really high early on the choice is up to you that is the risk you have to take  laura we dont know if we try it with the trammel and it doesnt work it doesnt break the  trammel we just have to try again  matt you have two strong and one fragile trammel in your midst  laura oh wait whos holding the /none/ fragile one  liam i am  laura youre holding the fragile one  marisha okay so save that one for when hes real fucked up percy and i had a thought for grog  travis thank god because i dont have any more  marisha if you borrow percys spiderclimbing boots i can maybe make some pillars to add for  cover for some of us more rangey people but then if i add pillars of different heights you can  climb up them  travis do i have to attune to them  taliesin no  travis does /none/ my speed translate to going up things as well  matt oh yeah  taliesin i dont know what boots you have right now  travis i have the feral leaping boots  taliesin would you rather just run like spiderman up to you  travis if hes more than 20 feet in the air im fucked  sam how can we get grog to fly though because these pillars cant go all the way to the heavens  can they  marisha i mean i could shapechange into something and give him a mount he can ride me  /none/ liam what about you scanlan  laura can you still cast if youre a dragon or something  marisha i can cast in beast shape shapechange is a spell so if im a dragon beholder thats what  you get  matt if the creature you transform into has spells you can use those spells but thats the  only circumstance  laura theres coffee all over it  taliesin yes there is theres coffee on everything there  marisha your dice tray dried nicely though  taliesin i think it actually has a little bit of nice character look /none/ at that  matt a testament to wyrmwoods craftsmanship critrole  laura this got put in the dishwasher and the leather got cooler after it got put in the  dishwasher  matt anyway you guys  sam no no were focused i guess we could use these pillars but it seems like a waste of your  spell to get him halfway up towards vecna if vecna is flying  laura the thing is if youre flying you can get knocked off ive been there and then its super  bad so actually the pillars are really wonderful in /none/ that regard  sam if hes straight above us  marisha well i can do six of them i can do a lot of pillars  laura he could be off of the tower yes and then its all ranged attacks thats what we have  sam all right no plan  taliesin the plans are easy the magic users are going to be attacking vecna with all theyre worth  laura hopefully well be able to take out the briarwoods before the fight  marisha i can cause up to six pillars each pillar is a cylinder five feet /none/ wide and up to 30  feet high and can do six of them  sam can you do them on top of each other  marisha well he wasnt that much more than 30 feet last time  laura he was above us but if he goes off of the tower  liam i was about 50 or 60 feet in the air and i was above him  marisha if i get grog 30 feet up you still have your throwing axe hes still reachable another 30  feet for you right theoretically  travis yeah but im /none/ not using the axe or the hammer im using the sword  matt you can still attach the chain of returning to the sword of kas  travis yeah but its only one attack per action  matt correct  travis instead of three  marisha but its something if hes out of range  taliesin ill have enough bullets that i may not be able to hurt him but i can make him drop  travis what are you planning on doing  sam my plan is to not run away because were going to die fighting or were /none/ going to save the  world right so i definitely wont be running away definitely  laura scanlan  sam i may run away  liam if you do and he slaughters everybody and subjugates the entire world  sam ill tell your story and ill tell it very well  liam as the crumbly the little guy to jabba the hutt for vecna  laura scanlan if you promise you wont run away ill put this fucking hat back on  sam gasps  laura and i bring out the stupid pointy hat that he gave me  sam /none/ wow thats a deal  travis heres the thing last time we fought vecna he went higher than 30 feet he was up  where vax was before he fell  liam i was above him though and i was 50 or 60 up he wasnt that high  travis oh  taliesin up to you that is an option that is up to you but let me know because either way im  going to either keep my boots or not keep my boots  marisha do we remember how high the tower orby situation was did we get /none/ a number for it  matt the tower of entropis the very height of it you didnt gauge entirely as you flew up but even  at a bit of distance it was hundreds of feet high  marisha no i mean there was the dome above that  matt oh the dome above that is probably about another 100 or 200 feet above that its a big  dome and it encompasses the entire city of entropis  taliesin and we dont know whos casting that we dont know where thats coming from  matt make an intelligence check /none/  taliesin okay  marisha i mean theres that gemstone thing that hes using  laura natural 20  taliesin no but a 21 will do it  matt you recall the thar amphala that is currently embedded in the titan is not the entire  city its only the inner circle of the city you encountered the inner circle of the city and you  saw a little bit of the edges theres a wall that is built on the inside of thar amphala this was  the same wall that contained the threshold crests that caused it to /none/ transport from the shadowfell to  the prime material plane you looked at the energy of this field youve seen it pulse from the wall  upward like pulse sounds  taliesin we could break through we could break the wall  marisha thats right and then we could bring in the forces  laura and then jmon sa ord will be able to help us help us  marisha help us help us jmon help us  laura thats good we go over the walls first heres the good thing about us bamfing to the  feywild right they /none/ think we left and if we all actually stick together and dont fuck up with  this fucking ring next time they wont know that were there again because last time they had an  idea because you guys you know almost died as we were going in  marisha yeah i know i remember  sam i have an idea about grog flying that just occurred to me trinkets big  laura he is  sam trinket could be polymorphed into something else big like a flying eagle of some sort and  actually be useful  laura how /none/ dare you if they dispel that wont he just turn into trinket and hell fall  sam yes but with big risk comes big reward  laura trinket  matt trinket over there is on the side arms playing pillow to the muzzle  laura okay bud if you fuck this up scanlan oh i dont have any more spells do i to do it he  can understand me i just cant understand him with my speak with animals shit  ashley tell him to just shake his head  laura okay oh its 1stlevel i have a 1stlevel /none/ left okay heres the thing scanlan wants to  turn you into something that flies  matt you hear this slight squeak of a bear fart in his direction  laura good job yeah would you be willing to are you okay with that for the actual big i  mean you could be up close and personal with fucking vecna  matt trinket walks up to you now and his fully grown form is a good foot and a half taller than  you at the shoulders he comes up and gets really close and bear breathing and butts /none/ his head  against you and then licks the side of your face  laura yeah  matt and sits back  laura aw you can do it dont hurt him okay  sam its a plan b  liam do you have anything gnarlier than i mean im a little invested too ive spent a lot of  years with this bear like anything gnarlier than an eagles cool but like anything with  spikes or rhino armor or anything like that  taliesin like a flying rhino  liam can you do a flying rhino  sam what /none/ flying things have we seen that are scary  laura a wyvern  marisha polymorph i dont know  sam i cant polymorph i could true polymorph trinket and permanently make him a wyvern  matt it can still be dispelled if it is permanent on true polymorph by the way  sam it can be dispelled just at an action  matt yeah that was an errata to the spell that ive discovered as the internet made very keenly  aware to me  sam even if it becomes permanent  matt correct  sam wow  marisha then /none/ what the fuck does permanent mean  sam a simple level three dispel magic can get rid of a 9thlevel permanent polymorph  matt well you have to know that the creature has been polymorphed into that form and even then  its a 9thlevel spell that youre trying to dispel which is not  marisha so they have to at least cast it at 9thlevel in order to dispel it  matt to be instantaneous or they have to roll against it  sam im not going to waste my true polymorph on that just standard polymorph  liam /none/ does that mean you could permanently do it to him and then we cast dispel magic on him  later to undo it  matt yeah you could do that  laura yeah oh so you could use that tonight  liam tonight to lock him in  sam yeah but it could still be dispelled  taliesin he would have to burn a dispel at 9thlevel  marisha wait are you talking about polymorph or true polymorph right now  sam i was just talking about polymorph  laura i think polymorph tomorrow and then use your 9thlevel spell /none/ for something major  liam but if its permanent why not do it tonight  laura because he can use a 9thlevel spell tonight for something  marisha because polymorph only lasts for like an hour what else you have  laura as were doing this were making the feast because were about to get ready to go to  bed right  marisha nom nom nom nom nom food  laura yeah so we make our feast before we go to sleep  matt all right polymorph is a concentration spell so keep that in mind  sam yes /none/  liam and taliesin oh  matt yes  laura oh shit  sam yeah  matt you wouldnt have to concentrate with true polymorph  sam true  matt but those are just the specifications  sam whats more important  liam could he be a baby like a young ancient dragon  sam yeah  laura you can turn trinket into a dragon  sam well lets see here he has a challenge rating doesnt he this trinket  laura yeah  matt i will put trinket at about a challenge rating of six id say because hes /none/ not a full  powerful creature hes a complement to you  laura right  matt id put him at a six maybe high end  sam so monsters of a six i dont even know ill look at the list  matt okay think about it regardless whos casting you said you were casting heroes feast  all right as you set up the table you summon forth the meal that is infused with divine energy  you all begin to eat in solemn quiet occasionally discussing plans and tactics the delicious  laura artagan can join us  /none/ matt oh he does dont worry as soon as you guys begin to eat at the far end of the table you  see the orange mane erupt from the side of table as he takes a seat oh wondrous i appreciate  this thank you  liam so did that live up to your expectations then  matt hello it was all right  liam new hobby or  matt i dont know have to try when theyre not willing thats a joke thats a joke  laura okay hey artagan can you look at this wand  matt /none/ which wand  laura this wand in my hand  matt which wand are you handing him  laura it was a wooden wand from one of vecnas people that i hijacked  matt its a war wand its a plus one wand for anyone whos casting a spell through it its a  plus one modifier to dc  laura oh do you have to attune  matt generally you have to attune to these yeah  laura okay great all right thanks  taliesin theres nothing special about these symbols that they wear around their necks are  /none/ they just since it is in your interest to keep us alive long enough to build you a portal  matt well it doesnt require or contain any magic if thats what youre asking  taliesin yes  travis its just jewelry  matt well its a focus its a divine focus for those who wish to utilize it to draw energy from  their deity of choice andor just a token of brotherhood  travis boring  matt delicious meal by the way  travis yeah  matt is it yours  ashley yes  matt thank you  /tavern/ travis so good  ashley oh youre so welcome  matt all right when do you intend to go back  laura as soon as we go to sleep and wake up  matt well then sleep it is and he gestures over his hand behind you and as you look back you can  see theres a series of beds that have all constructed out of the nearby moss and vines they  grow and lift up out of the natural floor of the feywild as the beds form you watch as the  tethered vines and roots to /none/ the ground begin to form these domelike tents over each specific bed  laura oh good privacy  marisha are you doing anything  sam oh yeah  marisha with your thing before we go to sleep  sam i mean if i true polymorph him trinket i could do a wyvern or a young white dragon or  is jmon a brass or bronze  travis and matt brass  sam i could do a young brass young white dragon or a wyvern or i could have another scanlan  laura oh i vote scanlan  sam scanlan two /none/ can cast polymorph  laura and hell just hang around with us second scanlan hangs around with us until what  liam i mean that is flatout amazing  sam well see laughs or not  taliesin the world is ready for two scanlans  sam im pretty sure it will be apparent that he is not a real person  ashley how will he know which is which  sam thats true well youll know because come on this charm cant be replicated  liam nah we need two hats or something  marisha hang on i will say /none/ a second scanlan will immediately clue in vecna that theres some  trickery magic going on  sam sure  marisha is there a way that second scanlan can be like definitely hidden so he can just be  snaps support scanlan counterspell scanlan  taliesin if we give him the hat of disguise then theres just a magical field being  about a magical  liam can the meat man join us  laura yeah lets do that  sam yeah he could be the meat man  travis no truesight no seeing through this  laura im sure /none/ they have truesight vecnas a god of course he can see everything  sam but i think you have to use truesight it doesnt just happen  matt as a god of secrets probably see through an illusion  travis no no on were going to pull it over on vecna were fine this is a great plan  matt just throwing it out there based on your experience even the creatures around the tower  have truesight  laura oh shit so hes going to know even like hes going to know trinkets not a fucking is  that /none/ seen on truesight oh no hes actually that animal so hed have to know  travis do it man do it were overthinking it  marisha because he can also maybe just cast support stuff for us right  laura yeah exactly fuck it do it  liam can vecna just dispel the second scanlan away  sam he can can certainly try  taliesin and he will have to burn some stuff  marisha and the only other thing would be like a second pike to do all of the freedom of movement  stuff and things like that /none/  sam thats nice  marisha those counterspells man  matt just keep in mind counterspell cant be done unless theyre on the field to see the spell  being cast and within 60 feet so second scanlan would have to be in the fray  marisha can second scanlan be invisible second scanlan  sam he can for a while yeah  matt you can and things that see through invisibility like a god of secrets would  probably see through it  liam you can never have enough scanlan theres always room for scanlan  sam these are /none/ good catch phrases for sure  taliesin depending on whether or not you have the mount let me know if you want to trade boots or  not since these are nonattunable  marisha okay hang on if someone has to roll to see if second scanlan is dispelled do you have  to roll  matt no  marisha second scanlan has to roll  matt vecna would have to roll  marisha vecna has to roll  taliesin and vecna will win  liam you know how vecna rolls  travis and were definitely doing the pillars  /none/ marisha i can throw up pillars  travis no i mean are we or are we not  marisha yeah  laura we are doing the pillars if hes not doing something on trinket  marisha i think the pillars could be good for cover and other things because im assuming were  travis okay cool were doing the pillars  laura scanlan do something so that we can sleep  sam all right i need the strength of two mes to win this fight so im going to drop to my knees  and wish to the gods that /none/ there was somehow more of me that i could somehow be in two places at  the same time i wish for more me memore me but more más scanlan  matt all right as the words leave your lips you can see artagan himself as he finishes the meal  leans back hmm like seemingly taken aback by the power of these words youve spoken as you  watch as hints of nearby slowly melting snowfall that seem to have gathered elements at the base of  the trees nearby begin to slowly congeal into a form you do /none/ realize that this is going to take  you 12 hours to complete right  sam oh yeah  laura so you shouldve started that earlier  sam shit

casting time  sam whispers okay  travis its okay  ashley its okay its done  laura whats done is done  matt over the next 12 hours you sit there focusing on trying to press your will into this  congealing snow golem of scanlan and watch /none/ as it slowly takes form and breathes air and with no  equipment of course but has your knowledge your spells eventually the completion of the  spell brings to life a secondary scanlan under your beck and call  sam oh my god hello scanlan is it you  matt its me  sam and matt gasps oh  sam youre shorter than i thought youd be  matt speak for yourself  sam all right lets just see if youre really scanlan  matt hes already naked  sam oh okay lets see i whip out my little /none/ measuring tape one inch by one inch by one  inch mmhmm that

indignant and  irritated  taliesin ive already planned them out  liam goodnight brother  taliesin goodnight brother  travis and we sleep  matt all right you all find yourselves resting /none/ uncomfortable at first but the knowledge and the  exhaustion hitting you eventually it takes you the dreams lead seamlessly one to the next  memories of your meeting of your story of your experiences bleeding between your fears your  victories and the people whose lives youve touched and whove touched your lives of wilhand  the fall of kevdak to the respect of your father and the vengeance of your mother to climbing the  destiny of the aramente to rebuilding the memory of ones family  and to spooning a second version of yourself  laughing  /dung/ liam singing oh my darling i hunger for your touch  matt and knowing that youve taken your faith from a place of being forgotten to a newly built  symbol of hope these thoughts all mingle as the dark of rest takes you and as you all awake in  the center of this strange mystical meadow peeking through the hints of purple and orange  that signify the sky that breaks through the canopy of this forest the pools of nala that once  brought you here long ago you all awake the beds gone the tents gone /none/ youre all lying amongst  this field in a circle around each other as you come to consciousness you all sit up take a  breath feel the warmth and the knowledge of what has to be done wash over you the shadow between  two distant trees reveals the orange mane of artagan once more as he steps forth his high  green collar disappearing into his long sleeves and a cloak that billows past his shoulders and  loops into his back as he almost glides effortlessly through the grass i take it you all  slept well /none/  travis yeah  matt well then time is of the essence youve been here more than a day  laura just barely  matt just know but whenever youre ready ill see what i can whip up as he wipes his fingers  against each other you can see the sparkle spiral of purples and blues and oranges and  colors causing this glow under his face and his hair as he gets excited at the prospect of seeing  just how far he can tweak the boundaries of the feywild that he calls home  marisha all right /none/  taliesin here we go  travis what are you holding over there  sam myself my other hand  laura trinkets back in the necklace for the bamfing over  matt okay  marisha to thar amphala on the back of a titan on the material plane  matt take them as you concentrate and the spell begins to swell around you this familiar  energy begins to ride up in your stomach you feel the butterflies take form and as the realm begins  to darken the colors that you see spiraling out of artagans hands begin to /none/ consume you as well  and nausea takes over and you feel yourself wretched left and right as darkness begins to  swell once more and close in the colors surround you entirely and you feel like youre being  pushed through a window as you all land and catch your feet the darkness subsides the color  subsides and you all feel immediately queasy falling to your knees  as you glance around you you can see you stand in the rubble the exterior of a building that has  fallen long ago you see large chunks of the /none/ secondary floor fallen inward and dust poof  around you as your knees hit you look up and can see the familiar greenblue crackle of the barrier  above you youve managed to make it on the interior of thar amphala you look up to see  immediately clusters of gloomstalkers in the distance they havent quite gotten a view on you  laura in the building now  matt you guys all dart make a stealth check please  travis first roll first roll first roll  liam natural 20  all hey  marisha good luck  laura /none/ oh thats good  matt thats one way to do it  marisha oh natural 19  all ooh  sam scanlan one 19 scanlan two 21  taliesin 19  marisha 28  laura 35  ashley 18  travis 11  matt okay this building is mostly collapsed theres a small alcove in the corner where part of  the secondary story is still there you guys dart into the side of it and you rest there for a  minute in quiet nervous breathing and you suddenly hear an impact of stone against the wall  behind /none/ you all of you guys immediately turn around and you watch as the heavy piece of stone  that marks the outer part of this building is now cracked and part of it begins to fall in i need  scanlan one real scanlan and percy to make dexterity saving throws please  sam not good ten  taliesin im going to burn a resolve  travis burning it already  sam what  taliesin i rolled really low i want to do that a little better  liam so take a conk on the head  taliesin oh fine /none/  laura no you dont know you dont know

thought they could be trapped /none/ under the wall or something  taliesin no it was fair im not in the mood for that and resolves i got plenty of  matt it crumples over onto you you manage to pull away as you turn around you can see right  around the edge of the part of the building thats collapsed and fallen a gloomstalker covered in  dust shaking its head as it attempts to stand once more it looks like its been slammed to  the ground or crashed into this wall and you can see its on the ground croaking noises shaking /none/  its head and trying to get back up its wings trying to unfurl  as it rights its head you see a leaping blur of black armor and red scales climb to the back of  the beast grasping the side of its shoulders as it spins back and forth trying to shake it you  see this humanoid figure trying to take something and throw it around its throat and its head  however its just not able to grasp it around and gets thrown off the side and to the back you  watch as the gloomstalker /none/ bucks off the assailant and begins to try and get its wings up once more  as the figure leaps up again and shoulder slams it into the wall a second time you get a better look  at it now you can see now standing at a pretty decent height about a sevenfoot dragonborn of  red scale and black hooked armor bladed and angry you see a burning fury in its eyes joe if  you want to come to the table please  all ooh  cheering  liam welcome to the table  sam whats this /none/  cheering and laughing  joe yes  travis brothers in arms yeah  taliesin i like that its kittycorner right now  joe the tanks on the ends  matt arkhan youve been trying to wrestle this gloomstalker down you spent days here trying to  find a way to recover from the circumstances that left you here this is the closest thing youve  had at this circumstance as youve regained your strength and as you leap onto its back it  continues to knock you off to the side you guys see this confrontation happening what do /none/ you do  laura does it look like pained noise  travis no ill run in  liam yeah hes attacking a gloomstalker ill join in  matt all right so what are you guys doing  liam im going to help this guy out and throw  matt all right so go ahead and make two attacks  liam all right plus one to  joe wait dont hurt him dont hurt him i scream dont hurt him  matt well hes thrown two daggers  liam i did

that down  you see two daggers into the side of the gloomstalker it gives this horrible shrieking  shout in pain and rears up  joe now that its distracted does that give me some sort of advantage  matt i will say given the pain its had make an athletics check because you are attempting to grapple  the entity  joe thats correct all right okay  laura can we see /none/ does it look like hes got hands and eyes complete  joe thats athletics thats going to be a 19  matt natural 20  joe is it part dragon  matt no it is not its considered a monstrosity  joe okay fair enough okay  matt thats okay you hear the dragonborn shout out seeing the dagger slam into its side what do  you yell to them as theyre attacking it  joe dont hurt this thing help me wrestle it to the ground  matt at which point it now thrusts the dragonborn off of its /none/ back he goes tumbling and  rolling onto the ground landing onto your back and you see it  laura i throw out the rope of entanglement on the gloomstalker  marisha i turn to percy and i go whos fighting who  taliesin i dont know  matt so now i would like an initiative roll from everybody please  travis and taliesin oh shit  travis whats that plus a d10

15 dexterity saving throw  laura yeah  matt all right lets see here natural one natural 20 to natural one back to back as you  fall onto your back and shout that out you go rushing towards it and you watch as this glowing  /none/ long piece of thick rope begins to suddenly wrap around this gloomstalker as its trying to take  off again it gets like a foot off the ground before its wings get pulled up to its body and it  falls back onto the ground wrapped and restrained by the rope  joe great i can do my thing now  matt is anybody else going to do anything right now  travis yeah i run up im going to run up and grab it by the head and neck and lay on it  matt okay scanlans  sam /none/ im just watching and i turn to scanlan two and say so thats a gloomstalker  taliesin yes  sam and that guy im not sure what he is but he looks really cool  taliesin i know what he is im not going to tell you though  matt all right arkhan  joe i remove this goldenneedled fivejeweled wreath from around my neck and i approach the  beast and i fasten it around its neck  sam and travis shock collar  matt kind of so its a dc 17  travis if it barks it activates /none/  matt five plus six thats an eleven it does not succeed you watch as the thrashing around  gloomstalker on the ground begins to slowly calm down until it reaches a point where its not  moving its breathing and you almost hear what sounds like a reverse purr  joe does this thing have horns  matt it has a series of spines along the back of the neck but no actual horns it has a head that  flares out like a cobra but its made of shadow where the jaw is its tongue lashes out but /none/  instead of saliva it gives off smoke  joe then i grab it by the back of the jaw here and i put my forehead down to its forehead and i  close my eyes and then open them and they turn into that things eyes correct  matt mmhmm  joe yeah  matt so the gloomstalkers they have no discernible pupil its a glowing beacon of  yellowwhite where each eye is and you watch as this dragonborn opens its eyes its headbutted  against it and the dragonborns eyes now match the coloration of the gloomstalker /none/  joe i climb up onto its back  matt okay its still bound by the rope but you get up onto it now you watch as this massive  dragonborn gets up onto the gloomstalker which is now currently on the ground trying to right  itself now still wrapped in the rope  joe you can release the rope now  laura does it look like anybodys noticed us  matt make a perception check  sam weve been fighting silently  laura 33  matt you do look and see two more gloomstalkers that have broken away /none/ from the cluster that are  making their way in your direction  laura will this thing obey you we should get inside i let go of the rope and go back in the  building so that we can hide  matt okay everyone else following  laura i cast pass without a trace on all of us  matt everyone else following suit  sam yes  matt okay you  joe yeah absolutely  matt all right do you leave the gloomstalker where it is and then step inside with them  joe can i take it /none/ with me  matt if you want to  joe id like to take it with me  matt as you guys all dart inside this alcove in the building like most of the roof is gone  theres a section of roof thats there it can hide most of you the gloomstalkers a bit large  as you all cluster into the space as it looms in heavy footsteps this is the second time youve  had an allied gloomstalker this close and its a very upsetting proximity  marisha uncomfortable elevator at a convention  matt kind of /none/ as you guys pull into the side id like you all to make a stealth check please  marisha why did you wear wings  laura stealth check  joe if im on its back does that have anything to do with my plate armor meaning am i relying  on some form of stalking that doesnt make my armor clank around  matt unfortunately as youre still riding it and it moves and shifts there is still the plate  sitting against it so you would still be at a disadvantage  joe am i the only one in /none/ plate armor here  laura no shes got plate armor  ashley nope clanky twins  joe i just didnt want to be fully responsible  travis she has something that makes her less clankylike  laura yeah you got your boots  ashley boots  laura yeah so you dont roll at disadvantage anymore  ashley wait wait  laura yeah you got nonclanky boots  joe and i am at disadvantage sighs  laura add ten to your roll  sam yeah youre fine  joe okay 20  travis aw yeah  joe disadvantage  matt by /none/ the way theres your stat sheet for the gloomstalker  joe yes  matt its taken 50 damage so you can note that  joe can i feed it a healing potion  matt when you have a moment you can yeah  joe yeah trust me its all going to work out what could go wrong  liam you were jumping at him and punching him in the face i thought wrong i do that sometimes  ashley do you have a name for him  sam do you have a name  ashley do you have a name /none/ thats true i just love animals  sam we can kill you any second so be scared of us if youre an evil person  joe you could but i know these two  sam what  matt and theres a moment of recognition for percival and keyleth  marisha oh holy shit  travis no way  marisha oh its been like two years  taliesin at least two years  joe at least percival youve aged keyleth you still look the same  marisha giggles  taliesin she got a haircut  laura oh shit are you going /none/ to let him do that to your girl  matt its at this moment you hear two heavy impacts from nearby rooftops  travis okay maybe not the best reunion time  matt as you all stay as silent as possible waiting one of them takes off and you can see it  arc barely over the opening but seems to be doing a wide sweep out of visual range the other one  appears to be stalking from rooftop to rooftop not far from you thudding sniffing and  croaking it leaps and lands on top of the small /none/ part of the roof thats above you guys it holds  a few rocks tumble around you as youre quietly in that space hoping thudding and croaking its  head peeks over the edge and looks straight down right into all of you  laura oh god darn it  matt what are you doing  laura i shoot an arrow into its eyeball  matt okay so as soon as the head passes over make your attacks youre close enough to get one  swipe up because youre on the back of a gloomstalker so as its head peeks /none/ down you can  get a strike at it  travis how high up  matt its about id say 12 to 15 feet up  laura 35  matt that hits  joe thats going to be a 31  matt that hits  joe damn thats a vox machina number about damn time thats what level 17 will get you all  right yeah  matt all righty so  liam 20 21 and a miss  matt okay so those both hit  laura 25 damage  matt 25 damage all righty  laura oh and i /none/ get to do it again  matt you do  liam is his proximity close enough that either of these guys are within five feet or anybodys  within  matt no oh id say arkhan probably is  laura 18  matt 18 damage  laura 18 does that hit  matt that does hit yeah  laura okay  sam come on instakill this thing  marisha i know i dont want to have to do anything  laura 18  matt okay  joe this is the paladin dilemma i think im going to save the spell /none/ slots but i am going to  swing at this guy  matt go for it  joe okay im going to swing my battleaxe faneeater  matt okay so you get two attacks with that  joe great oh okay well one was 31  matt yep  joe oh thats going to be nine plus 14 thats 23 points of damage on the first one and then  second attack is going to be a 23  matt that hits  joe and thats going to be 21 points of damage on the second  matt all right /none/ and with that as soon as its head peeks over the edge two arrows whooshing  under its throat and you watch as an axe cuts part of its head clean off as it tries to make a  noise but the blade is caught in its throat and prevents the air passage as faneeater is yanked  out of the side you see the jagged edge of the axe arc back causing blood to splatter across the  back the wall behind him as arkhan goes in with a second swipe and with one clean cleave motion  the /none/ head falls and plummets into the ground the rest of the gloomstalker tumbles in lifeless  into the rock and you see as it lands its wings sprawl out and slowly the body begins to dissolve  into black smoke and shadow  sam i run out and i say wait dont kill it im just kidding its fine  taliesin vox machina may we introduce you to arkhan  sam arkhan  marisha arkhan  sam hi  marisha you look like youve you know you look like us you got more stuff weve acquired more  stuff over /none/ the years thats cool  sam how do you know this gentleman  taliesin we did some work ages ago  marisha yeah forever before we really knew any of you  joe the temple of shumash  laura how did you get here  marisha it was a crappy swamp it was good times yeah  matt technically it was a desert but yeah  marisha it was a crappy desert good times  sam well it was the worst kind of swamp it was one with no water  marisha it was yes the driest of swamps yeah /none/  taliesin what are you doing here  joe thats a long story weeks ago we wound up attacked by a cult my companions and i this cult  was led by a death knight and a sorcerous woman  sam lady briarwood  marisha sylas  joe and then vecna followed and we were ambushed my companions and i were marked for  death they were all destroyed and i watched that death knight burn the closest thing ive ever had  to a brother and he cut the stillbeating heart out of our goliath and then these buzzards /none/ came  to pick my bones thinking i was dead but i wouldnt die the queen had another plan for me  sam the queen what kind of queen  joe i hold up my shield  matt make a religion check scanlan  sam hm thats no good 11  matt you have passing knowledge that the symbols that adorn both around arkhans throat and the  shield that he holds up are that of the scaled tyrant tiamat which is the patron god to  chromatic and evil dragons all across the world  laura oh hes evil /none/ thats evil thats the evil dragon potentially  sam you serve this queen  taliesin hes our kind of evil its fine  joe i understand that because of my dogma we belong to groups that would never mix but i can  assure you if you help me get revenge on the one that killed my friends i swear to you i will  fight for your lives with the fury of a man who is already dead  taliesin i think we have a surprising amount already in common  travis good pitch  sam devils advocate maybe /none/ not i dont know maybe  liam i mean im just going to do an insight check on principle  joe i make the gloomstalker snarl at the two scanlans  matt snarls  liam yeah i rolled an eight he checks out  marisha quick question we didnt roll our temporary hit points for our heroes feast  matt oh you did not you should do that  marisha can we do that or does pike do that for us  matt yeah pike you roll the temporary hit points  marisha for all of us right its an /none/ additional 2d10 im pretty sure  matt so roll 2d10 pike and everyone who was present for that  laura oh yeah you should give us a speech how long does that last  marisha oh i totally shouldve given a speech  liam thats a tenminute one yeah  marisha no its a short rest thing but its a thing that lasts until  laura later then  marisha yeah i shouldve done that before but ill do it next time  sam whatcha doing over there johnson  ashley im just looking for my tens  laura oh /none/ no  liam two ones  marisha two ones  ashley wait are these 12s  laura no those are tens  matt all right so you guys gain two additional hit points to your max hit points  laura that is such a bummer  joe is that everybody  matt yeah you werent there for the meal unfortunately its from earlier  laura its okay the meal didnt do a lot apparently  ashley so glad im here to be useful  matt however everyone does still have their advantage on wisdom saving throws and youre  immune /none/ to fear which is pretty huge  marisha and poison  matt and poison the hit points are more of like a bonus youre fine  liam it was slim fast slim feast  matt and marisha slim feast  joe can i feed this thing a healing potion  matt you may  ashley i really thought i was going to roll two tens  joe greater i think greater  matt if you have yeah  joe i have a greater  matt so that would be 4d4 plus four  ashley i rolled the wrong i actually /none/ rolled the wrong tens  joe thats nine thats not great  sam no thats not great well figure it out later  taliesin we know lay on hands and some such  joe well i have them i just dont want to blow them  travis wait you cant die  sam is that true wait when did he say he couldnt die  travis well he said like she thought i was dead but my queen  sam he said he would fight like a man who is dead but he wasnt  taliesin it was a metaphor /none/ grog it was a metaphor  sam oh no youre right  liam do you mean actually have you died  joe its kind of a colloquialism for religious folk you know what i mean like i hit a death save  laura oh tight tight tight tight  sam i touch him to see if hes real  joe i blow smoke out of my nostrils like a little fire  sam kind of squishy really soft  travis thank god hes wearing that armor huh  sam yeah pudgy  joe im going to pump 30 then back /none/ into this gloomstalker plus the nine so there was what  51 that came off  matt 50 points of damage were taken off  joe 50 points so i put 39 back on so thats 11 off  matt yep you got it  travis when do we want to do freedom of movement stuff not yet  liam thats short term  laura right before that only lasts for an hour heres the thing do we go for the outer walls to  take out the shield first probably once we go in were going in  sam /none/ the outer walls of the city  laura of thar amphala yes  sam how are we going to take down entire walls without being  laura we dont have to take out the walls we have to break a couple of the crystals  marisha yeah those crystals that we started to break when we were in the shadowfell  taliesin if just do a hit and run we can cause so much chaos that all of these gloomstalkers are  going to be busy dealing with everything in the air  laura hey you remember our old plan /none/ of just set everything on fire lets set everything on fire  marisha yeah in fact thats actually a brilliant plan we could disable a crystal maybe  i could light a signal distract people while theyre distracted we make it to the next one  taliesin and as long as were close to that one they dont know that were here they cant see us  joe what are these crystals  sam we dont know where these crystals are  taliesin theyre all around the outer wall  laura we saw them when we were in the city /none/ before  marisha yeah in the shadowfell remember we jabbed at one and decided against it  sam all right  taliesin if we break these crystals this could help  marisha everything  travis does anyone know that youre here  joe vecna the female wizardess  laura she knows  joe and the death knight  taliesin and if theyve been watching he just vanished we should run now  joe but they thought i was dead they left me for dead  laura so they dont necessarily know youre in the city  joe i think theyd /none/ be surprised to see me  laura okay all right cool  marisha lets move  laura okay stealthily lets try to make it to the outer wall so that we can cut out some of  these crystals  matt okay first off make a perception check as you glance out to see how close you are to the  nearby wall  laura 30  matt 30 okay you notice youre on a different part of the city than you were previously if the  citys moving forward if you consider the direction that the titan is traversing /none/  forward you guys were to the back and right side of thar amphala like a clock if twelve oclock  is where it was traveling you guys were around four or five oclock looking now at the layout of  the city youre closer to 11 and 12 right now and youre maybe about 200 feet from the nearest  wall you can see the curvature of the dome is pretty striking from your current position and  you can see the pulses the waves imagine like a reverse waterfall of energy shooting upward and  every now and /none/ then theres a burst  laura does it look like theres an area that the pulses are brighter along the wall  matt yes you do see the pulses arent universal there are certain locations about six of them  throughout the city that you occasionally see them bursting and they spread out  laura are we close to one of those pulses  matt you can maneuver there its not directly behind you but you can eventually get to that  location yeah  laura okay i see where one of the crystals is lets move towards that  /none/ taliesin well get grog to smash it to smithereens  travis i smash stumbling mitheens  ashley you do to mitheens  travis drawn out mitheens  taliesin youre so good at punching walls  matt all right i would like you all to make a stealth check are you all walking on foot are  you taking the gloomstalker  joe im on top of the gloomstalker  sam is it walking  matt yeah  joe its walking right now  matt its currently walking unless you want to hover with it  sam you got to stay /none/ within 60 feet of us 30 feet  matt 60 feet  joe id like to hover  matt as you guys are staying lowkey arkhan is currently riding against the back of this  gloomstalker as its hovering in the air above and the stealth check youre going to be rolling is  going to be to see whether or not anything notices you on the back of a gloomstalker the  gloomstalker is not going to register on the radar of any of the current watching creatures because  its part of its posse for the moment  /none/ joe so is this with disadvantage for plate armor or not  matt i would say no because it isnt a movementbased stealth check youre just trying  to stay still  joe with the bonus  laura plus ten  joe love it good 31  matt shit all right youre just clutching the exterior of it trying to stay low youre pulling  into your armor like a turtle shell since it is black and using that to try and blend into its form  sam and can we kind of stay under the shadow of the gloomstalker /none/  matt you guys can move along  sam oh 29 and 20  taliesin 34  matt keyleth  marisha 32  matt vax  liam i rolled a four so its 37  matt fucking rogue  laura 29  ashley 18  travis what  ashley no i did it wrong  travis oh 19  matt okay  sam his head has muscles  matt okay a five and a six all right so as you guys begin to maneuver through the streets  dodging from building to building on the outskirts of thar amphala thankfully /none/ the streets  are a little more sparse on the edges you also notice as youre traversing and this is  interesting  joe its his head shot  laura i would have liked if he had signed it  joe its arkhans commercial head shot  marisha yeah yeah yeah you need to print one in black and white  liam deep voice if im good at reproductions  joe this is like work in the office look  marisha laughing thats such an la joke yeah  matt all right so as you guys are maneuvering vax vex /none/ and keyleth as well you have the high  passive perception of the group you notice that the droves of undead that have been clogging the  streets of this city and the clusters of cultists that have been running about busily running from  location to location with some work on their midst the undead who were just scattered and  wandering are now unified and moving in patterns theyre now being driven by some intent whereas  once they were just scattered amongst and in a holding pattern now theyre maneuvering with  solid purpose away from the /none/ sides of the wall and the shields which enables you to go  relatively unnoticed but youre seeing them now gathering towards similar tunnels to the one you  came up in you can see dozens and dozens of zombies and skeletons and the occasional robed  cultist both warrior and mage alike all beginning to make their way down into the titan  at various points in the city  sam making their way down  taliesin theyre going to go attack the city  laura we got to get these shields down so that vasselheim can actually have /none/  marisha and liam a fighting chance  travis lets find the crystals  marisha all right lets do it  matt as you guys make your way around the edge of the city you follow these pulses they occur  every two minutes or so so you have to keep an eye out for it until one happens and then reorient  your direction but you taking point on this you lead everybody darting from place to place man  rolling shittyass perception  travis thats okay matt  matt thats okay for you guys  travis let it /town/ happen  matt eventually you come around one cluster of exterior buildings it looks to be what was once a  manor that was converted to a fortress like a small exterior fortress to this inner circle of  thar amphala you curve around and there you see familiar to you from once before the walls that  surround the exterior of this inner sanctum of thar amphala and the basis of this field that  contains the entirety of the city looking at the wall you can already feel the dangerous vibration  of this field being so close /none/ theres this violent hum to the air that with each pulse hits this  certain frequency of sound that causes your ear to tweak just a hint and you can see violent waves  of greenblue magical energy pulsing up the side of the wall like a very powerful reverse  waterfall shooting up to gather and maintain this field you cannot see the crest the crest  was visible from the outside of the wall and the energy field is being produced on the outside of  the wall youre on the inside of it but you can gather /none/ the base location of where this burst is  happening to get an idea of loosely where it might be  laura how thick is the wall  matt you dont know  laura and we saw the crest before because there was a doorway in the outer wall  matt correct yes  laura is there any kind of doorway around us  matt you glance over to where the door was below the crest before and you can see the opposite  side of a door currently yes it is shut and appears to be made of hard /tavern/ wood with its iron  bar reinforced crosshatch  liam well we can try the door and then if that doesnt work grog can make a new one  laura yeah  liam let me check out the door  travis im not really so keen on making doors as opposed to knocking them down im a craftsman  all right im just me  liam im going to check and see if the door is trapped  laura how are you with doors  joe pretty good  travis and joe yeah  travis and taliesin sh  liam /none/ 26  matt thankfully only rolled a nine  liam 26 for investigation on the door  matt the door is locked but it is not trapped  liam all right lets open it up  joe i hand grog some jerky from my pouch hungry  travis oh fuck yeah dont share it  liam 28  matt 28 okay so the door clicks and its interesting as you put your lockpicks in to feel  the tumblers you can feel the metal vibrating like the entire door is just buzzes and as you  hit it and the /none/ door swings open almost like somethings been pushing it on the opposite side  it swings open and slams on the inside of the frame and there youre looking at a wall of  violent green arcane energy whoosh coasting by actually this is blasting downward right  now because the threshold crest as you recall was above the doorway in the wall  laura can we see it like above the doorway  matt no its flush  laura its like on the other side  matt its on the other side and up on the wall and currently /none/ where the door opens there is  violent magical energy slamming down  laura do you think its possible to like punch up on the archway and knock the crystal down  liam i pick up a rock about that big walk ten feet back and throw it at the energy  matt it hits the field and theres a violent flash in that section about a foot radius around  where it was and the rock shoots past you make a dexterity saving throw  liam ooh thats not good 16  matt 16 strange wow thats the first /none/ time youve failed a dex save in a long time  liam yeah i rolled a three  matt oh thank god  laura so happy about it  marisha you are fallible  matt you take six points of bludgeoning damage thats a d4 plus two but it literally pelts you  in the side of jaw and the neck and you turn around and feel it and you can feel the pulsing  of the blood begin to flow into the bruise thats going to be there tomorrow  liam i literally just got choked to death 18 /none/ hours ago so im not sweating it whatre we going to do  taliesin grog lets start drilling up  laura try punching up  sam all right but if we interfere with that forcefield and it somehow hits us were going to  be hurting  travis oh yeah not only should we back up a little bit except for me we should also have an  area that were going to run to right because im sure this will bring the noise  marisha and laura is there a house nearby  matt theres about a 20 foot /none/ gap between the wall and any nearby building and there is the large  fortresslike manor that you saw earlier i mean i say fortresslike manor its not a huge house  its two story and a decent size but it looks like its been reinforced in the walls like  somebody had designed for it to be a place to hold off some sort of a stand probably from the war  with pelors army long ago thats the closest thing to this doorway  laura okay we can get ready to run there however were staying within 60 /none/ feet of you while  youre punching  travis arkhans going to stay just in case it needs like a double  laura a double punch  travis yeah you know  matt its probably more than 20 feet actually its probably like 30 40 feet  laura 30 feet away  matt yeah  joe how many gloomstalker riders are in the sky above  matt i mean overall make a perception check  joe okay yikes eight  matt theres a lot of them  travis skys clear  matt like theres a lot of them by entropis /none/  joe gloomstalker shit hits me in the face  matt yeah but you do notice that theres where previously there wasnt theres a cloud gathering at the  top of this dome funneling down onto entropis  travis actually well hold on you got to stay here right because of the  laura thats what i said im staying within 60 feet of you  travis i would like to rage  matt okay  travis and i go tiger uppercut and i just punch the roof of it  matt go ahead and make an attack  liam /none/ destroy  travis yeah destroy 23  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage d4 plus your strength modifier  travis that is 15 just by itself so  matt times two thats 30 points of damage with a punch  sam one punch man  matt fucking siege man thats good as you slam into it you guys watch as right above the  doorway in the door frame the entire wall just a spider crack shoots up about 20 the wall is  about 30 feet tall or so actually probably not its about 20 or so /none/ feet and it cracks up to the  very top and you watch as large parts of it break off and fall but it hasnt completely collapsed  but its sustained some very serious damage  taliesin one more and we run and take cover  travis one more  laura and ashley yeah  matt i also need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw please  liam im going to walk up behind him  joe hes within ten feet of me he gets a plus four  liam and plus two from me  /none/ matt awesome well they dont stack  liam doesnt stack  matt the plus four is what you get  liam then im backing the fuck up  matt from the aura  joe aura of protection provided by tiamat  travis 24  matt 24 all right you suffer it would be 14 points of force damage reduced to seven and youre  pushed back 20 feet but youre not knocked prone so as you slam into it theres a burst of arcane  energy out of that section of the doorway and wall that slams into you you /none/ go spinning past  spiraling and you catch yourself on the ground about 20 feet away in the middle of the open  there catch yourself  liam feet skidding like a jackie chan film  matt still dont fucking see you okay  taliesin its a very loud  matt im rolling so shitty today  sam yeah well youre going to roll well when it counts  joe ill take a shot  matt you take a shot as well  joe yeah  matt all right so as grog spins back and catches himself you walk up /none/ to this doorframe with your  axe in hand  joe yeah  matt go for it roll an attack  joe okay thats going to be a 19  matt 19 hits  laura 19 hits a wall  matt its an ac of 18 on the wall  sam the wall has an ac of 18  taliesin the wall has my armor class thats really horrifying  joe with my axe  matt its solid  laura its a magic wall  joe thats going to be 20 points of damage  matt 20 points of damage /none/ thatll do it so as grog catches up and look up you watch as arkhan  rushes forward and with a giant leap cleaves the axe into the stone as it does the archway  collapses downward first off make a constitution saving throw  travis im standing there like a catcher ready  joe con save all right not big money this is not its going to be more whammy than big  money thats a nine on a con save  matt thats not going to do it okay you suffer 16 points of force damage and you /none/ get blown back  into grogs direction and knocked prone so you catch but the impact actually pushes you back  five feet and he falls face first on the ground theres actually a dig in the ground like a  groove where the impact is at that point as you watch the wall crumble and collapse you see  suddenly dislodged from its position the about two and half foot wide threshold crest stone that  is embedded in the wall there crumples downward and falls out of its space as it does theres a  series of bursts /none/ of vibrant arcane energy that shoot up the wall causing this side of the wall  to glow exponentially brighter than the rest of the shield at which point like a large slice of  pie one sixth of the dome falls inward and for the first time since youve arrived you see the  nonfiltered sky above of the darkened clouds that have completely encased the upper atmosphere of  othanzia you also glance past where it crumbled as the city is at a slight angle forward the way  its placed on the front of the titan and /none/ you look down and see immediately around the  familiar sight of the vasper timberlands that surround the exterior of vasselheim and there  ahead not more than maybe a few miles off you can assume from this distance you see the  singular mountain pillar that vasselheim is built around and the outer wall in sight  marisha i dont know do we keep going do we try to get down some more  joe alderaan is in sight  travis were coming around that planet  taliesin were going to run  matt everyone make a perception check /none/ please  travis i got this guys dont worry  joe famous last words  marisha opal die dont fuck me  laura 27  taliesin 27  sam 20  joe was this passive perception because if it was then i rolled a natural 20 of passive  perception the natural one  marisha 18  travis three  ashley 12  matt okay those who got over 20 theres this small victory and this moment of joy and  accomplishment that is immediately washed over by the realization of how close you are to the city  the /none/ two hours that you were gone still better than a full rest however has put you within  proximity of the city and you hear this familiar large airy reedy stretched screech in the  distance you glance over and you see in the distance barreling down in your direction a  skeletal dragon familiar to you not far before  marisha move move move  sam i dont think were going to be able to move  liam we can hide though  travis were going to hide  liam we cant run  laura at least get in /none/ this building there was that encased part right  sam were all in the same enclosed space  liam ring  matt theres a towerlike structure and then theres that building that was reinforced to be a  travis if he spots us we scatter and spread but  taliesin we are not going to scatter and spread were going to stay together no matter what  laura were going to stay within 60 feet of each other  taliesin there is no scattering  laura within 60 feet of us its super important  matt if you all are /none/ rushing into this building everyone make a stealth check please  joe is this a hovering stealth check  matt if you want to still stay out in the open that is up to you theyre all darting into a  building so the choice is yours you can stay with your beast  joe but hes one of them so i can kind of leave him outside somewhat  matt he is youre on top of him  joe yeah i am  matt so do you want to try and blend into his form  joe id love /none/ to i think thats what i want to do  matt okay then make a stealth check  laura if youre within 30 feet of me you still get plus ten  matt you would not be within 30 feet of her once she enters the building so  marisha can you do the cool john wayne thing and go underneath of him and hang on his belly from  the saddle  joe yeah thats what im trying to do  matt make an athletics check  joe 28  matt as this happens you immediately climb down to /none/ the underbelly of the gloomstalker to maintain  hold on it because its physical form and its interesting now that youve been this close to  it and youve been wrestling it you feel its partially corporeal theres something about its  physicality that is almost gelatinous like its made up of a combination of shadow and physical  will and as you clutch into it your fingers dig and begin to seep into it almost like a cluster  of tar but it holds you fast and youre there underneath make a stealth check without  disadvantage but this /none/ will  laura is it a boy or a girl gloomstalker  joe im close enough to know  matt gloomstalkers are actually sexless they have no natural  joe whispers it seems to be asexual oh do i have a little  matt you do not  joe groans  laura oh no  joe this is going to be an 11  matt okay good to know the rest of you guys  joe that was a shitty roll  travis oh 16 no 18  laura add ten  travis i did  ashley 22  laura /none/ 33  liam 46  marisha 27  taliesin 30  sam 19 and 30  matt okay  laura no 43  matt okay as you guys all dart into this building you all quietly listen outside as you  maintain hovering in place the skeletal dragon croaking swoops down as its wings catch itself  the wind billows through the space in the center here you can see a bunch of the dust and pebbles  and loose rubble thats been built up around here and the wall that was left behind just gets kicked  up and /none/ spins a brief dust devil in the vicinity the skeletal dragon there still flying make a  perception check  laura but were within 60 feet of him right you said we werent within 30  matt hes kept relatively close to the building  laura okay  joe so i didnt get the plus ten  laura and matt no  laura but youre still hidden from view from vecna  joe perception thats not terrible thats a 16 perception  matt okay as soon as the dragon gets close and youve seen it flying about up in the /none/  stratosphere area of this dome before you can see there are still bits of flesh dangling off of  the bones and it is a familiarcolored flesh  laura gasps  taliesin and sam oh no  matt whereas you and your adventuring party had traveled here before this risen dragon form  seems to have been torn from the corpse of the mount that brought you to this city  joe oh no  matt you see as the skull of its body its eyes crackling bright bluegreen energy there on the  back of this dragon you /dung/ see two humanoids standing on its back you see a dark armored male  with pale skin with a wellkept beard and short hair with his arm around the waist of a female  whos currently clutching onto the back of its bones you can see the woman in a red robe thats  being blown up her hair bound in the front wild behind as she has a necklace bauble that hangs  around her neck crackling bluegreen energy as she has her hand forward she glances around at  the space angrily what heavy breathing looks over at /none/ the gloomstalker oh what have we  here is this your doing  sam maybe she doesnt see you maybe shes talking to the gloomstalker  joe i control the gloomstalker and make him screech  matt screeches adorable wouldnt you say so honey and the man behind her goes oh quite  well im a fan of taking thorns out of my side is it time we do a bit of surgery darling and  the woman goes but of course oh how ive missed you and she nuzzles into his neck a bit  and turns around the /none/ dragon lands onto the tower across the way facing in the direction of the  gloomstalker and it inhales and you watch as it begins to breathe in all of the shards of bone  matter that have been scattered across the streets of the city begin to whip up and spiral into its  ribcage like a blender as it pulls back roar and as the dragons mouth opens it releases a  blast of bone shards that arc out in front of you you and the gloomstalker each i need  sam into the earring i say this /none/ is our chance we leave him as a distraction and we go they dont  know were here we can run  matt you and the gloomstalker make a dexterity saving throw please  laura but heres the thing were not going to have a better chance to get them away from vecna  should we attack them now  travis plus we have one extra ally two  laura we can attack them now away from vecna  joe you said dex save  matt correct  joe i actually have an advantage on dex saves that i can /none/ see  matt there you go  marisha maybe wait for them to land  sam and laura are they landed  sam are they hovering  matt theyve landed on a tower right across from the building where you guys are  laura how far away is that  matt let me show you  cheering  travis shouting oh this is it oh no  sam and ashley airhorn sounds  laura oh my god  marisha so wait is it vorugal is it thordak  liam no its his mount  marisha its your old mount  /none/ joe i rode

as it swoops up the dragon takes one arc with the  blade and as it streaks across it slams into part of its foot and you watch as the bone  splinters upon impact with the sword of kas as the dragon lands it brings its head down into the  gap where the opening is and arches forward as it does it fills the /none/ entirety of the space it  inhales a second time you watch as all the bits of bone

of exposed skin and flesh has been hit with  a thousand needles that ends its turn percival youre up  taliesin so i can gather my wits theres an angry delilah with a wand clutching a weird thing  around her neck theres a sylas with what i assume would be a brand new sword  matt probably  taliesin and theyre sitting about how many feet up on a dragon right now  matt id say about 15 feet

points of psychic so 14  matt okay 14 points got it  taliesin for my next trick im going to burn another point of grit lets push sylas ten feet  another 31 to hit  matt that hits  taliesin so lets take a little damage and do /none/ a little psychic i do not like this die im  getting rid of it its only nine points of damage plus two points of psychic  matt so 11 to sylas  taliesin so now sylas

as  you slam it into the undead dragon watching bones splinter and break from the blast of dark energy  joe love it second attack  matt go for it  joe thats a good one too thats going to be 29 same thing 3rdlevel divine smite 7d8  counting 47  laura kill that dragon  matt as you pull the axe back you arc a secondary time this time with the sound of a union of four  different dragon cries the fifth one being your own as you slam the axe a second time hitting  /none/ the edge of its clavicle it carves through and breaks you can see part of the bones shatter and  reform but still broken and not in the same way its a serious round  joe just a hint a tiny hint of remorse for having to kill this thing that i helped raise  all aw  laura thatd be like if i had to fight undead trinket  travis legendary action incoming  matt sylas briarwood is going to move his speed would you hand me sylas please  taliesin hes prone  matt hes prone so has /none/ half it he moves through he gets partway

groans hes going to go ahead and make /none/ a strike at you oh you  know what no hes not going to sylas instead axe in one hand grabs the side of the skeletal  ribcage hanging off looks up at you you seem rather strong and looks you dead in the eyes i  need you to make a wisdom saving throw  laura no oh my god no do not get turned  travis does he have advantage on wisdom something  laura no he

screaming  matt oh shit  travis in the clutch  joe i stare him right in the eyes what would have happened  matt he wouldve charmed you and you wouldve had to start fighting /none/ them  travis and marisha no  matt as he stares at you you feel this cold presence consume the back of your mind and you  feel drawn to him its this force of charisma and drive and as you begin to lean forward towards it  you feel this thump in your holy symbol and as you glance you break the gaze for a second and  look down and you see the multicolored fury of tiamat reach up and block and obscure the vision  from him and as the flames burn off you look up and /none/ the presence is gone and he looks at you with  a frustrated glance  joe yes rage  matt hes going to use the rest of his movement to dart back around the side of the tower  taliesin how much movement does he have left  matt he used a legendary action to get up and get his movement then on his turn he got his  movement  taliesin all right no thats a good  use of a legendary action  matt that brings us to pike  ashley can i get upstairs stay hidden somewheres /none/ enough  matt sure you get to about where the twins are  ashley im going to cast beacon of hope choose everyone that i see  matt everyone within 30 feet that you can see gets affected that you can see does it say  ashley choose any number of creatures within range  matt which

arkhans in direct vision  laura what does this do again  ashley you have advantage on wisdom saving throws and death saving throws im also as a bonus  action going to cast sanctuary on vex  matt sanctuary is a bonus action  ashley its a bonus action  laura what does that do okay okay  matt sanctuary means that if something tries to attack you it has to make a wisdom saving throw to  see if it does so or not  travis its what earthbreaker did  matt end your turn pike /none/  ashley am i able to get hidden around the wall  matt your movement wouldve gotten you just up to the stairs at that point because you had to climb up  it at the end of that turn swooping down you hear two impacts on the roof above you you hear  the growling tearing sound as the long dry rotten wooden rooftops that are above you guy get pulled  open by two gloomstalkers thatve joined the fray  travis toothless  taliesin do they count as undead  matt they do not count as undead  /none/ ashley is the roof off of it  matt now the roof is open its damaged bits and parts of it are fallen inward you guys can move  around but they have visual on you but thats all they can do this turn it took their full movement  and action to break in thats going to end their turn scanlan youre up scanlan one  sam scanlan one turns to scanlan two and sings a song of healing  matt scanlan two as in the  travis which one are you prime or two  sam im prime /none/ right now  matt a simulacrum can not be healed except by  sam ever  matt they can be repaired  sam but not healed with a healing thing  matt correct  sam or a potion  matt correct  laura how do they get repaired is it like a doty situation  matt kind of  ashley once theyre gone theyre gone  matt yep  sam then never mind that  matt you would know this having known the spell and the significance of its creation if it is  damaged you can repair it in /none/ an alchemical laboratory using rare herbs and minerals worth a  hundred gold per hit point  sam oh boy  taliesin can scanlan two heal himself  matt no he can heal other things  laura how damaged is scanlan two already  sam a little  ashley wait from what  matt the skeleton dragon breath  sam all right its all good guys were going to be fine then scanlan one will heal himself with a  bonus action healing word  matt okay  sam and then hell grab scanlan two and dimension door behind the /none/ dragon  matt oh shit  laura what are you doing  matt both of these guys appear behind the dragon right behind it  sam on the ground  laura do you know sylas and delilah are right there  liam by delilah or here  sam back there  laura sylas is right here right next to sylas  sam yeah  laura you want both of you to be right behind sylas  matt im allowing you guys to move things thank you  laura do you want melee range or do you want back ten feet /none/  sam back ten feet that would be great  matt all right so thats your action and bonus action  taliesin you can move  sam wait this was scanlan one  matt scanlan two hasnt gone yet scanlan two is at the very end with keyleth  sam scanlan one will walk around the side of the thing  matt there you go all right vax youre up  liam i really am oh my okay  matt actually at the end of the turn sylas is going to use another legendary action he got them  back /none/ actually because he used it before last turn so he uses his first legendary action to  head up  laura he can climb up walls  matt he runs up the side impacts he glances down looking towards where you are all right  thats going to bring us to vaxs turn  liam yeah okay so if i get to the very edge there am i in range of delilah on the ground  with sharpshooter cover doesnt do much except full cover  matt yeah she would have cover in this circumstance but you avoid it with /none/ sharpshooter  so you can  liam and am i within 60 feet over there about  matt yes  liam okay im going to throw whisper at her and shes down so i have advantage that is a 27 to hit  matt 27 to hit hits  liam and im going to bamf there  matt shes prone so yeah you have disadvantage on the attack against her  liam what because shes prone  matt its a ranged attack you dont have advantage against her because theres nothing  giving you advantage  liam her being prone /none/ doesnt give me advantage  matt no her being prone against ranged attacks its with disadvantage roll a second time  liam thats much worse  marisha but it cancels out  laura because of sharpshooter  matt sharpshooter means he ignores cover doesnt give him advantage on the attack roll  marisha that sucks  matt hold on what was that one  liam 18  matt 18 technically would hit shes going to use shield as a reaction to add plus five to her ac  shes on her back and sees the dagger and goes ping and /none/ deflects it off  liam all right second attack is a natural 20  travis really  liam yeah with whisper she has to make a saving throw with a dc of 18 or become frightened of me  for a minute on a crit  matt what was the dc on that one  liam 18  matt 18 she has a plus ten wisdom save so thats going to put her at a 20  liam all right counting  laura thats a great way to roll  liam 72  matt 72  liam yeah its a /none/ crit double the dice  matt right but its not sneak attack though  liam oh sorry so 32 thank you  matt no worries  travis wow your reverse math was super fast just then that would have taken me five minutes  matt all right  liam and im going to bamf there on it  matt okay  laura its fine  liam dont worry and with my bonus action im going to throw my third dagger up at the wall can  i throw whisper again is it like quick draw or does it have to /none/ change daggers  matt technically id consider it to change dagger generally because youre throwing them so fast  liam all right then instead im going to disengage and im going to dart back between the  scanlans  marisha between the scanlans  matt all right that ends your turn vax  travis keyleth  matt at the end of your turn sylas is going to use his second legendary action  liam wait she used a reaction to knock the dagger away  matt sylas  liam she used shield which is a reaction so she cant hit /none/ me with an attack of opportunity never mind  matt thats not what this is sylas is using a legendary action this has nothing to do with  delilah  laura youre talking about your disengage dont worry about it  matt sylas is going to use his second legendary action at the end of your turn to take a swing at  grog with his greataxe of the eclipse  laura greataxe of the eclipse  marisha wait delilah or sylas  laura sylas  marisha okay  matt that is a 21  travis that hits  matt /none/ that is 14 points of damage reduced to seven and i need you to make a wisdom saving  throw please  taliesin with advantage  travis with advantage oh wait thats a d10 natural 20  relieved noises  travis first one was a three  matt as the blade sinks across you you resist the impact but you feel this cold sensation  across the wound that begins to spill across your body you angrily in your rage flex against it  and manage to withstand and shrug off the effect that ends that next up is keyleth /none/ and scanlan two  sam hey  marisha hey scanlan two are you just as charismatic as scanlan one  sam ive got all the words to make the girls like me  marisha okay i dont care okay keyleth is going to try to do a onetwo punch here shes  going to move forward and then does she see delilah  matt make a perception check id say probably actually you watched her get knocked back youre fine  marisha okay im going to reach out and do an entangle spell right under her  matt okay  /none/ marisha unless she can make a strength save versus my spell shit  matt that is a four plus one no  marisha fail so she is restrained and then im going to run and im going to use my mantle of  the tempest to jump and then trying to be dope here in midair im going to change into an  earth elemental and try and grab onto the bone dragon and see if i can snap his neck in the  process grapple the bone dragons head  matt okay entangle is an action  marisha yes /none/ and then im running and jumping and grabbing for the rest of my movement  joe do we need some more tape  matt actually i can finally use the layer over here  laura do you want me to get the tape  matt all right you leap over thats the rest of your turn after entangling her you run leap and as  the wind from the mantle picks up you watch this gust of wind lift her make an athletics check  laura to try to land on the dragon  marisha a straight athletics yeah whimpers /none/ 11  matt okay not too bad thats enough it was maybe a 15foot jump at this point and its  tripled because of your mantle so you leap and land transforming into the elemental and  grappling onto its back all right that ends your turn keyleth scanlan two  sam shes grappled now  matt she is yes  marisha yeah fuck her shit up  taliesin shes prone and grappled  marisha prone and grappled and not for a very long time  sam so if we hit her it automatically hits right  matt physically you /none/ get advantage on attacks against her  sam is bigbys hand a magic attack or a physical attack its a melee spell attack  matt its a melee spell so you get advantage on the attack roll yeah  sam okay then ill change my plans and ill do that scanlan two will cast bigbys hand at  level6 and pound her really hard shit  joe is that a philip seymour hoffman happiness reference  laughter  sam is that 6d8 or 8d8 bigbys hand i always forget  matt its 5thlevel and youve cast it at 6th correct /none/ so its an additional 2d8 to the punch  sam and it starts at 4d8 oh so its only 6d8  joe would you like to borrow some d8s  sam yes you know what im going to do it at level7 then  matt you already said 6th  sam okay thats fine all right so a bunch of d8s  matt you have to roll to hit first so d20 with advantage  sam 17 plus 11  matt yeah that hits so roll your 6d8  sam yeah one two three four five  joe or you /none/ can use the smite dice  sam i like these 29  matt all right  sam 29 and then i guess as his bonus action hell inspire vax whos not even here  matt sing to the space where he was  sam scanlan two only knows the songs of scanlan so he will sing weirdly hollowly singing when  i get that feeling i want clarota healing  laughter  sam he only knows the songs that he already knows  travis i told you its the jam  matt all right so when he gets back give /none/ him the d12  sam and then he moves he ducks back behind there yeah just peeking out a little so he can  see where bigbys hand is  matt okay at the end of your turn sylas is going to use his last legendary action to move his speed  without provoking opportunity attacks he leaps off the side and lands right next to delilah  marisha does he get entangled because he did just land in difficult terrain  matt hes not entangled i dont think because he wasnt there for the casting difficult terrain  means /none/ he moves across at half  marisha hes in difficult terrain  matt okay good to know  marisha i have rocky ground thats all i have  matt all righty so entangled okay yeah got it cool that ends the legendary action grog  youre up  travis can i jump to the top of the bannister here so im looking down at old tangledup  delilah sighs may i leap off the tower and straight onto delilahs prone body  matt sure make an athletics check  sam so romantic  laura feet stomping her chest  matt /none/ thats easy enough make an athletics check actually in case something goes horribly bad you  are raging so you get advantage  travis 25  matt okay easy enough at that height you take eight points of bludgeoning damage reduced to  four and impact you land arcing over her both feet to each side of her and youre standing  looming over her body as shes wrapped up in vines going grunting  travis i fucking hate this dead bitch and i raise the sword and start swinging down in these  huge arcs at her the first /none/ two attacks at her  matt okay as you pull the blade up the voice goes yes her shes part of the web her her  and you give into the fury go ahead and make your attacks  travis are they with advantage because shes prone  matt correct well shes restrained  travis so not reckless natural 20  cheering  sam shes going to die  liam butcher that motherfucker  travis should i roll the second

3d10  matt /none/ correct  marisha and is that doubled too  laura no  marisha okay  sam that would be crazy  travis 62 i rolled pretty low  matt okay so as you bring the blade down with this horrible screaming hiss  laura thats one hit  matt yeah 62 points of damage the blade jams into her chest and as you twist it she screams  and the blood from the wounds sprays out in the middle of the air freezes and then slips into  the blade as its sucking up the blood shes like grunts entangled /none/ and she reaches up and  grabs the blade and begins to start pulling it out of the wound shes choking as blood begins  splattering up around her mouth but shes still alive  travis did you want it out here let me help you out yells and put it back in  matt roll again  travis that is a 32  matt okay roll damage  laura i like it when the music stops were like hyperventilates  travis 24  matt 24 you jam the blade in a second time and gash across and it carves /none/ open this part of her  chest and you can see the blood spatter out the bones are exposed and shes on the ground  shaking shes hanging on by a tether and her eyes are going wild and she glances over and her  hand goes out and you can see sylas whos right next to her his eyes are wide and hes reaching  out to grasp for her hand  laura gravelly chop her hand off  matt is that the end of your turn oh youre frenzied raging right  taliesin oh no yeah  marisha /none/ come on come on grog  travis i was going to do something to sylas but fuck it were going to hit her  sam whispered chop off her hand  laura chop off her whole arm  travis 33 to hit  matt that hits roll damage  laura singing please die deliah we want you dead  taliesin third times the charm  travis 23  matt 23 points of damage are you rolling extra undead damage on this on these attacks because  shes not undead  travis nope nope 23 plus i wasnt even adding i /none/ was so excited about the sword damage i  was forgetting my rage damage  matt right but you rolled 3d10 there  travis i did yeah the d10 plus 2d10 slashing damage to undead right  matt shes not undead though  travis oh shes not  matt no  travis oh shit  matt youve been adding that to all the attacks okay noted roll  travis i figured she was dead then not dead  matt roll 4d10 for me right now im going to retract that from the damage shes taken  travis 22  matt /none/ shes still wounded but shes not hanging on by that thread okay so the damage you rolled  for that attack  travis 24 but i hadnt added my  laura so do your damage again because that  matt roll the d10 and add your modifiers  travis okay fair enough shit im so sorry  matt its okay  laura he wasnt doing his rage modifiers so you could add that then potentially  marisha the difference  travis so thats 21  sam with your rage  travis yeah  matt so as you hack in a /none/ third time with the blade making a smear of blood across the ground  the entangled vines that hold her there are soaked in crimson at this point and shes  coughing and sputtering you can see the open wounds in her chest and her hand reaching out  sylas and hes going for her at that point thats the end of your turn shes still alive  travis yep  matt vex youre up  ashley good job  travis i thought she was undead just figured  matt no shes alive  joe shes a clone  travis /none/ oh really  marisha yeah i was wondering about that  travis sylas is undead  matt correct  travis the dragons undead  joe no because ive faced her before  travis are the gloomstalkers undead  matt no  travis not undead  laura i bet shes a fucking clone  ashley what does that mean  laura she made a clone of herself  matt that ends your turn vex  laura okay so if i attack her its at disadvantage or with  matt with a ranged attack yes because she is well shes restrained which /none/ gives her advantage  so technically it would be just a regular attack roll  laura well then im going to attack her shes already restrained fuck it im going to attack  her with a blazing bowstring  matt go for it  marisha kill her kill her  laura yes 17 plus 14 with sharpshooter  matt yeah that hits  laura minus five oh god 15 plus two is 17 25 30 plus the blazing

pointing  at her like hows it feel bitch hows it feel  matt as she reaches out her eyes are locked with sylas shes not even paying attention to grog at  this point all shes focused on is escape and grog as you look down at her and sylas is looking  into her face reaching out the arrow just impact through the jaw and out the side of her  cheek there breath catches and her eyes go cold the spell incantation fades and the hand  just twitches and falls to the ground still  marishia /dung/ that was so dope  ashley yes  matt as that happens sylas his hand still reached out goes yelling no  laura oh i feel so bad for him  travis no you dont  laura i do have another attack  matt he turns around to look at you vengeance i suppose is mine this time  laura and i attack him  matt this is a unique

thats bad oh man  matt 28 points all right so as you rush forward with your axe you swing down into sylas who gets  slammed in the side of the shoulder and as the spark of the divine smite energy slams into his  side you can see him hes starting to feel the pinch all of you surrounding him  joe thats a cock  matt roll again its a dice actually  joe thats not great thats 19  matt 19 does not /none/ hit unfortunately  joe i would like to frenzy  matt okay so youre rolling your third strike  joe frenzy reckless  matt yeah  joe thats going to be a 27  matt 27 hits roll damage  marisha kill

29 which was a terrible roll  matt first attack slams into /none/ it and bursts second one you swing and sylas form turns to  shadow temporarily and dissipates around the blade and returns the third hit does strike true in the  back of the head yelps he yelps out in pain as the blast bursts upward you can see the flesh  burning from the impact of the radiant damage that end your turn  joe i believe it will do so yes  matt that brings us to sylas turn sylas does not regenerate because the radiant damage kept it  at bay  travis i did not know /none/ that  joe its why i did divine  matt radiant damage prevented his regeneration looking at his current circumstance hes going to  marisha no  matt you watch as he glances around and his body whoosh into a bat  sam scanlan twos going to cast counterspell  matt its not a spell  groaning  matt scanlan two goes to counter it but theres no spell to counter  marisha vampire bullshit  matt turns into a bat fluttering  marisha i have a reaction can keyleth the ellie try to grab it  matt you dont /none/ get to grab you get an attack of opportunity  marisha can i  matt you get an attack of opportunity you get an attack of opportunity and grog gets an attack  of opportunity  laura and bigbys hand  matt bigbys hand does not get reactions  joe does they get a attack of opportunity  matt yeah one attack  sam against a bat  taliesin which means if you hit him enough he drops back to human  matt thats not how a vampire bat form works its not a polymorph he has the same hit /none/ points  in the bat form as he does in his normal form  travis what if i made this a reckless tripping attack  laura does that work on a bat can you trip a bat  travis i dont know i dont know if it would ground him for one second or not i dont know  thats why im asking the dm  joe who goes first out of all these attacks of opportunity  matt you go first  joe okay then i would like to attempt to snatch the bat with gloomstalker  marisha yes /none/ come on yes  joe has a snatch  matt okay  marisha snatch that bat  ashley get that snatch  matt roll an attack  joe thats a 24  matt 24 hits  joe snatched  sam what does that mean snatched  joe the target is grappled the target is considered restrained i can also fly with my  grappled target at half of my speed its 2d6 plus six piercing damage right  sam he doesnt like this  matt because the snatch is a special attack essentially as a reaction because a reaction  /none/ gives you a melee attack its not an actual attack towards him let me doublecheck here for  you guys real fast  joe was that me trying to sneak one by  sam no no it doesnt say that its special why dont you plan a backup just in case  matt just double checking here okay  liam how are you doing there m  marisha im nervous  taliesin its our fidget spinner  laura i need a food for my nervousness  taliesin i will let you know if it snaps while its in your teeth /none/ it hurts a lot i know that  from experience  marisha yeah this is like what dr seuss warns us about as kids  laura you could break your tooth  sam guys what are those shirts can you hold up that shirt again oh there it is  taliesin this is the face matts not making right now  joe after if you want to enter the raffle im not sure how this works but i brought this shirt  were going to rub it all over travis at break and then the winner is going to get /none/ this shirt these  only come in extra large  matt i will say because i dont allow monsters to use special attacks as reactions and havent  used them the entire game against you guys because that wouldve been much more dangerous i  wont allow it for this circumstance but it does still do the damage on the regular attack  joe fine okay great then im going to bite this right in the fucking nose  matt itll still hit go ahead and roll damage  ashley it can also be a halloween costume  sam ooh /none/  marisha oh my goodness matthew mercer  matt this got really weird suddenly  taliesin were going to show up to the next game all wearing them like a terrible council of evil  marisha laughter just the eyes cut out  joe not bad do you want me to break it down piercing and necrotic  matt no thats fine  joe okay 29 points  matt actually no i do need two of those  joe okay then were going to have 19 piercing and eight necrotic  matt okay cool  joe 19 and eight 27 /none/  matt make your attack of opportunity your attack of opportunity and your attack of opportunity  travis im going to do reckless trip attack  marisha dont fuck me gil its fine it kind of fucked me 12  matt no ricochet noise off his armor  joe 30  matt that hits roll damage  travis 34  matt hits roll damage  travis hes undead right  matt yes  joe you first grog  travis oh no please  joe no no no you

other  travis yeah 17 and then i roll a d8 or i add a d8  matt d8 additional damage yep  travis its my first one ive ever rolled five shit what did i say  matt 17  travis thank you 22  matt all right 22 damage  travis its a trip attack  matt what does it say it does ill pull it up  travis /none/ oh ill pull it up ive got it right here  matt here we go okay a strength saving throw thats a natural one so hes going to use his  last legendary resistance to resist it hes out of legendary resistances now all right and  damage on that one  joe just pumped a 1stlevel divine smite and thats going to be 21 plus three is 24 24  travis does his hand turn into a bat with him or does that fall  matt all of his equipment goes into his form  joe thats going to /none/ be 40 points of damage  matt as you all slam into the side of this bat form it shrieks out and then just flapping  it takes off and is going to use its action to go ahead and go into a dash and continue  to fly away  taliesin i feel like i would be able to get an attack somewhere in here considering my range if i  pulled out my big gun  matt oh yeah no were coming back to that he is at that full speed and that form  travis plus were /none/ still in initiative order  liam our reactions come from melee range  matt okay so that ends sylas turn pike youre up  ashley how far away is he  matt he would be about lets say at that flying speed of the bat which i have to look up now  because thats a thing  taliesin how could you not be prepared for  matt i know what is this bullshit matt jesus christ the bats flying speed is 30 feet so hes  60 feet away from you guys at an angle that way  laura /none/ like here  matt yeah 60 feet up there all right pike what are you doing  ashley okay im going to  marisha i love your commitment to the tickle  ashley im trying to think of what i should do okay im going to try to guiding bolt it  matt okay  laura guiding bolt up the butt you want to move forward so you can hit him  ashley yeah  matt guiding bolt i believe you have to roll your attack on that one yeah make a ranged spell  attack  ashley 18  /none/ matt 18 does not hit  ashley im going to use guided strike  matt okay  ashley which adds plus ten so 28  matt you can use it on yourself right  ashley yeah guided strike is for myself war gods blessing is somebody else  matt thats what it is yeah go for it that hits go ahead and roll damage  ashley im going to do it at 3rd level so thats four 6d6  laura 6d6  matt 6d6 radiant damage  laura all radiant that is a really good roll  taliesin that looks /none/ solid from here  sam ashley johnson clutch bicoastal roll  matt bicoastal roll  ashley okay 23  matt 23 impact the bat now is shining the next attack against it has advantage end of your turn  ashley let me see my bonus actions ugh i dont want to use that in case okay thats it  matt all right end of your turn going to use its legendary action to move at speed the bat is  now 90 feet away that ends your turn that brings us to scanlan oh the gloomstalkers actually  which are /none/ no longer stunned but thats the end of their turn end of the gloomstalkers turn its  going to use another legendary action to move another 30 so its 120 feet away scanlan youre up  laura hes really far away from us now  matt hes just full sprint  liam you said 120 feet away  matt 120 feet yeah  laura can you do anything at 120 feet scanlan  sam i can do something i can do one thing  marisha if you guys let me go right now i can try you can do something /none/  sam scanlan one will just hold his turn until those gloomstalkers are in range or until they  move and then hell cast i dont know frigging wand of magic missiles i dont know  matt sure all right end of scanlans turn will use third and final legendary action is now 150  feet away  marisha no let me go first  matt were now at vaxs turn  laura yeah you cant switch your initiative  marisha you can if other people hold and you describe  matt they can hold their action but then at /none/ the end of their turn he still gets to do movement  liam all right im going to use my movement and dash so five ten 15 50 55 60 and im  going to paladin attack the gloomstalker up there  matt okay  liam first one is great that is a 33 and the second one is also pretty good 25 do those both hit  matt they both have an ac of 15  liam okay shit shouldve called sharpshooter all right so the first one is one plus eight is nine  travis can he use /none/ a legendary resistance on a grapple  matt no because a grapple check is a versus  liam seven so 11 and seven just 11 and seven on that gloomstalker  matt got it ends your turn keyleth youre up  marisha how far away is he  matt 150 feet from where he was  marisha im going to drop my form take my action to cast earthbind on him its a 300foot range spell  laura oh my god please please please hes used up his legendary resistances right  marisha he did  matt whats the save /none/ he has to make  marisha strength versus my spell save  taliesin do you have something because of your hit  matt that is 22 17 plus five  marisha 22  matt 17 plus five  marisha you cant do anything  taliesin the last time you hit him does that mean  laura advantage  matt its a saving throw its not an attack yeah the earthbind does not take effect on him  unfortunately  marisha can i do it again immediately can i try again  matt no its an action to cast the spell /none/  marisha yeah  matt sorry  marisha i know can i wait and  matt okay scanlan two anything  sam hes 150 feet away  marisha he rolled so fucking high  laura can you run 30 feet and then do something  matt he can run 25 feet  sam i can run 25 feet and then reach 120 feet  matt yeah youre just under  sam im five feet shy  joe wait i can get you on the back of this thing and fly it up there  liam yeah but we cant get /none/ out of range of the ring unless we want to  laura i mean as soon as sylas isnt there hes going to know were here  joe so we have to stay within 60 feet of each other  laura or we can all just run  marisha if you all hold i can try again  taliesin no because hes going to keep running  laura if we hold he just keeps moving  marisha yeah but its a 300foot range spell and hes only 150 feet away i dont think he can dash 150 feet  sam /none/ he already did 150 getting to your turn so hell be able to do another 150  marisha but its a 300foot range spell  liam hed still be in range  taliesin we dont have to hold our turns well just get back to you  marisha right thats what im saying  taliesin oh yeah no were fine i mean thatll happen eventually if its going to get there  laura whose turn is it  sam its scanlan twos turn hes going to bonus action bigbys hand grapple one of the  gloomstalkers  matt okay  /none/ sam the one weve been working on  matt all righty bigbys hand punches  sam not punches grapple  matt okay well say for the purposes of this theyre  sam theyre easily killed  matt theyre pretty easily killed given the circumstances you guys have the chase now  sam well do you want to kill them or save them for riding on  joe bah i think im  laughter  joe 40 minus three is 37 this ones got 37 hit points of damage  laura just try to get sylas  joe do what you /none/ feel scanlan  sam well ill just hold him for you  joe oh thanks i appreciate that  matt lets say grog you go up there and start anything you want to do  travis i want to see what the inside of them looks like  matt okay for the purposes of expediency in this so we dont spend time just trudging through  these things you guys just hacking at these gloomstalkers  sam one were saving for him  matt okay i will say to note that the control feature generally is a onceaday type thing /none/  sam ooh then never mind we kill it  matt not like it can constantly regenerate to the next thing  joe hmm let me read my description that you sent me all right no okay im calling mike mearls  marisha we get back around everybody is he still fucking here  matt we get to sylas turn sylas dashes twice  taliesin wait is it sylas turn or my turn  matt sorry its your turn then sylas so go ahead  taliesin my turn first im going to take my advantage shot because i have advantage /none/ because of  matt with which gun  taliesin with bad news  matt okay  laura wait why didnt i get to go  matt oh sorry youre first go for it  laura can i run out the door and hop on my broom and fly as far as i can  taliesin no no no no  joe 60  taliesin ring  laura yeah but i can only get 50 feet away from you guys if i come here  matt as soon as you go around that side youre starting to get close up to /none/ you you have scanlan  all the way over there you barely have scanlan in your  laura so i cant leave so im at the bottom of the stairs if i run up the stairs and broom it  from here how far would i get  matt ten feet out the window  laura ten feet out the window and hes 150 and im my shot is what but with sharpshooter no  thats different  liam doesnt affect range it just affects your chances  laura shit wait let me look at fenthras im just hoping theres /none/ something that says its 300 feet  matt fenthras does not change your range  laura nervous laughter okay then its only 120foot range right with a longbow  matt well the way longbows work is you have an inner range and an outer range so if hes  beyond  taliesin but if youre sharpshooter the outer range is the inner range  laura oh yeah  matt yeah your max is 600  laura my max is 600 fucking feet  matt yep  taliesin oh yeah so you just walk up and take a shot  laura /none/ okay then im going to walk up to the window and im going to try to cast bramble shot  on him  taliesin with advantage  laura with advantage  sam its an attack  ashley because of  matt guiding bolt go for it  taliesin much better  joe holy freaking halfelf  laura 20  matt 20 just hits  cheering  marisha get him down  laura oh my god okay so 12 thats 18 plus 4d8  liam sharpshooter doesnt double the distance  matt no but you have the two different ranges because /none/ your range is technically 30 to 60 but  you can go the full 60 without taking disadvantage after 30 feet  liam so its at disadvantage normally  matt no disadvantage as a sharpshooter its a crazy feat  laura 43  matt 43 points of damage  laura and he has to make a strength save of dc 17 or be restrained  matt that is a nine plus five that is a 14  cheering  matt as the arrow hits the bat you watch as the arrow bursts into a sudden swarming of bramble  vines /none/ they wrap around him and the bat small impact  laura and does he take bludgeoning damage from hitting the ground  matt he does take a little bit hes about 80 feet up from there because hes going at an  angle so he takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage  sam oh my god that was the most sniper thing youve ever done  laura that was pretty awesome  matt and with that you watch as the bat form poof dissipates the brambles fall weak and open  sam is he there  matt make a perception check  /none/ laura can i see him  matt make a perception check  sam no bueno  liam i got 26 for vax  matt you see a misty cloud in the space where sylas was  laura 34 misty cloud how did we fight him before sunlight destroyed him before  sam radiant something right  laura sunbeam destroyed him before  travis when he was in the gaseous form  laura now hes in the gaseous form okay so i rolled a 34  taliesin i rolled huge 28  matt 28 to what  taliesin perception  matt /none/ yeah you see the mist  taliesin how far away is he  laura hes 150 feet away  liam he didnt get a chance to go  laura hes 150 feet away from us  matt yeah  laura so as a group we can all try to move forward but as we get closer to him  taliesin youve got what it takes whats the distance on that thing  laura whats the daylight casting distance can you run forward and get close enough  marisha you guys arent going to want to hear this i can run /none/ forward and sunburst him at 150  feet away but its going to burn my 8thlevel spell  sam dont do that  marisha i have sunbeam which is a 6thlevel spell at 60foot away no i dropped my form  matt yep  taliesin what if you got on a mount  sam just to get there as fast as you can  joe but we cant get outside of the 60foot bubble  taliesin we can all move together and he will not be able to move at high speed as a mist  laura hopefully  marisha /none/ can i scoop up vex and dash 60 feet ahead and sunbeam him for another 60 feet  matt dash as your action  taliesin and we have to stay together  laura we have to stay together  joe well youre in the gray no where are you  marisha im green  laura im technically right here right now im on the second level next to pike  joe and bigbys is  sam is it your turn keyleth  marisha yeah whose turn is it  matt its finishing vexs  laura no its percys turn  /none/ matt okay so percy your turn  laura you could technically try to sh oh yeah mist form  laughter  joe was that a jenga  taliesin wait i have a weird thing im going to try and do no the thing i need to do i need to  get within 30 feet  laura well you can get within 60 feet of me so just move toward  taliesin im going to move to the edge of where im capable of moving right now at my speed im  going to signal everybody and say move as /none/ a group so were going to try to sync our movements  matt all right well say for the purposes of this the mist travels and vanishes from sight by  the time you are able to catch up to it to get it to a place where you can destroy it delilah  briarwood has been destroyed seemingly for the last time sylas has been driven to wherever he  needs to recover  laura does it take him a long time  sam vecna gives up  joe can i say one thing right now  matt yes /none/  joe as we were moving in the bubble i cast animate dead on delilah and i raise her  taliesin youre doing what  sam were fighting her again  matt as you look out you can see the mist and the mist vanishes and you can see now looking  up dozens and dozens of gloomstalkers have all turned to see this outintheopen action thats  now taking place in the space around you you are all out not being stealthy firing and shooting  out into the air and you see now clusters of these things heading /none/ in your direction as you  turn and look to the side you watch as delilahs body gets up from the ground  joe rise and kneel before your master  matt as the shambling corpse of delilah falls to her knees before arkhan  joe oathbreaker baby  matt as the realization begins of what is coming at you two you could handle maybe theres a lot  in your direction you have revealed your position the wall was already destroyed and  everything is swarming in your direction as you all begin to turn around you hear this /none/ deafening  roar from the sky above you you glance up to see a flash of brass light as devossa comes swooping  into the barrier behind a hundred or more wyvern riders risen from vasselheim to join the rest of  the brigade come swarming in and collide with the gloomstalkers you now see a frantic dogfight  cluster as hundreds of one and hundreds of the other begin slamming into each other tearing each  other apart you see blades swing you see arrows going flying and devossa begins to do sweeping  rounds back and forth across /none/ the sky you realise if there is a moment to move with the distraction  its now  joe i load delilah on the back  taliesin i grab her wand  marisha and her holy symbol that fell to the ground  laura whatever that sparking thing was  matt the glowing sparkle light in it is inert now  marisha is what inert  taliesin it was the controller so we have it  laura we book it towards the tower right  matt you guys begin bolting your way towards entropis with its large funnellike cloud  /none/ encircling the top of its spire and were going to take a break  cheering  travis yall we recruited dead delilah  joe i want to find this dude  marisha what a dick  matt were going to take a quick break because we want to probably push to 11 tonight and then  were going to leave so make a quick restroom break fast as we can come back see you guys  here in just a minute  laura at the break were giving away  marisha were giving away things  taliesin so many things /none/  joe jocks machina  marisha yeah actually max or ryan is there stipulations on the shirt  taliesin nope  marisha well figure it out  joe hey travis go put this on  matt okay guys well see you here in a few minutes  taliesin take the wrapper off thats weird  break  matt welcome back a little longer than i anticipated but thats fine were going to jump  in here but before we do that the winners for the wyrmwood box we have zabando is the winner  for the jocks machina shirt we /none/ have alcyon299 congratulations you get to join the very  exclusive jocks machina club  travis testosterone poncho  joe only five of these the others my trainer ron who plays another goliath and my brother  nick who plays an elf ranger who was incinerated by the fucking death knight  matt so bringing it back in as you guys are charging your way toward entropis running through  the streets you do the best you can to dodge in and out of any sort of things that might catch  your attention streetside you see most of the /none/ undead and various cultists have been filtering  down beneath the city a while back and youre not entirely certain where they are at the moment the  few dregs there are around there you guys easily enough dodge around  pushing forward you see the spire of entropis growing taller and taller the closer and closer  you get to it as soon as you get to the base of the spire you look up and you can see the broken  seams of the oncetoppled tower now held together by the network of glowing magical threads like  /none/ arcane veins wrapping the tower and lending an unsettling organic nature to its visage the  exterior still stands windowless like an obelisk of tyranny looming over the entirety of the city  the apex of course is now obscured by shadow and cloud this slowspinning tornado of twilight  darkness entwining the top blocking visibility and possibly entry at the top numerous  gloomstalkers encircle the higher level not currently engaging in the main fray which is  chaos all around you see more emerging from this cloud almost seemingly creating them  the large front doors of the /none/ tower appear somewhat ajar and open there is one rot behemoth currently  standing in front of this door vox machina what do you want to do  travis i dont want to overthink this but i feel like the sword said that it wanted to cut the webs  of vecna can i just cut the tower down  laura i dont know if thats  travis i take your laugh as a sign of  sam i dont know if you can cut the whole tower down theyll probably try to stop you dont you think  ashley /none/ you could certainly try  travis i could couldnt i  ashley yeah  travis perhaps not  laura i feel like do we see any other doors like secret doors maybe  sam do we see invisible doors  matt perception glancing around you dont see anything it looks like this is the door  entrance to it you could make an investigation check but youd have to get up against the wall  and carefully check it  laura can i do that without letting the rot behemoth see me  matt you can certainly try  travis /none/ thats a big fat no  matt you can certainly try its not a no  liam but were directly in front of the door a ways back how far back  matt youre about 40 feet away from it off to the side glancing over where you can see the rot  behemoth looming in the archway  laura we didnt really think about how we were getting up the tower did we  joe heres a possibility i have a gloomstalker and i have delilah i put her on the back of this  thing and fly it /none/ up there maybe this thing moves out of the way  laura maybe the rot behemoth moves  joe im just saying  sam can she talk can you make her talk  joe i dont think i can puppet her i can tell her to do commands  laura can you tell her to talk  joe shell understand what im saying but i dont think she can  matt by the way as youve made this journey forward and delilahs been shambling behind you  know sitting behind you this strange pain has been hitting you in the /none/ back of your shoulders  you glance back and look at the corpse of delilah behind you as a rapidly growing tree is protruding  and growing out of the chest of the corpse and is now setting weight off of the top of the  gloomstalker as its trying to flutter up behind the party  laura sorry sorry thats a thing  joe can i cleansing touch and end one spell  matt its less of a spell effect and more of a divine seed that was placed inside her body when  she was slain by the /none/ vestige fenthras  laura i placed my seed inside of her  taliesin and it quickened  matt dont make it weird  laura i make everything weird matt  joe im not going to further question you about that  sam you knocked her up  joe yeah okay must be an elf thing thats interesting very interesting okay great  sam maybe theyll think that its just a fashion thing and theyll let her through  matt its still growing and its now protruding about four feet from her chest the body is now  starting to get /none/ a little topheavy  laura just chop the tree down its a thin tree  matt yeah its not very thick its maybe about okay so you take a couple hacks at it and  eventually you manage to cut away the tree now theres a trunk thats now stopped growing about  a foot out of delilahs chest with roots that have taken root up into the shoulders and the chest  laura thats sick its like shes got a builtin shield now  travis can i take one of the fancy robes that remains in the bag of /none/ holding and drape it over  the trunk coming out of her chest so its a little more hidden  matt sure  laura now it looks like shes pregnant  sam i need a house can i take her branches and make one  matt a house  sam oh its the giving tree  groaning  laura thats terrible  something clanks on the floor  laura oh what was that  matt you have this rot behemoth at the entryway what are you guys doing  liam well our options are somehow flying up or going in /none/ the front door  laura do we fly up or do we go inside and up the tower im sure theres no traps or horrible  things on the inside of it  marisha last time pike and i took it down with a couple of earthquake spells  taliesin but that didnt help nearly as much as we thought it would  marisha i mean we didnt have to go up the damn thing so maybe check yourself before you say things  sam lets just charge in this is a fricking giant right weve killed giants  travis /none/ behemoth is it dead undead  matt the rot behemoth its undead  joe its undead how big is a rot behemoth  matt the rot behemoth is about 12 feet tall or so just a mass of stitchedtogether undead flesh  joe medium or large  matt large  taliesin ive got an idea can i borrow some of that infinite rope  laura of course  taliesin all right im taking the infinite rope and im tying it around my little gem that i have  laura the little blue gem  taliesin my little

cat when i was a kid she loved it im /none/  sure the rot behemoth will too  matt okay so you take the pulse stone you tie it around  taliesin i tie it around in a monkey fist knot i toss it about 20 feet away im going to give it a  throw im going to throw it about 20 feet away from the were all in agreement of this plan  sam this is the best plan  liam wait one second do we want to lure it into a house and all of us be waiting to gank the shit  out of it  /none/ taliesin well technically wait hold on  matt you see a flash and a flare in the sky above you you see a cluster of gloomstalkers immolated  by a burst of flame breath from devossa whos now up in the stratosphere at this same time you  see about a dozen or so wyvern riders go riding into this slow spinning storm and get  disintegrated into pieces  taliesin im actually going to throw the gem then past the stone giant into the room just a  little bit so that anything in the room  matt make /none/ a strength check for me thats a bit of a lob  taliesin okay nine  matt it makes it about the 20 feet you intended to clattering  laura pull it back and well have one of the i mean not that youre not strong and very  matt so what was the range on this pulse stone  taliesin 30 feet  matt okay it is within range to affect the rot behemoth  taliesin okay i have to roll though i have to do a roll to see if it survived the throw  matt thats true /none/ yeah  taliesin yeah its fine  matt tink tink its a will save for the rot behemoth  taliesin dc 15  matt wisdom thats a two no you guys watch as the rot behemoth the stone clattering its  metalarmored face and glowing coal eyes turn heavy footsteps and walks over to the gem and  stares at it  taliesin lets all go in shall we and im going to walk around it and stealth in  laura pass without a trace is still fucking up if its been less than an hour  matt make a /none/ concentration check for me real fast make a constitution saving throw  liam we just watched the wyverns get obliterated trying to fly into the swirl at the top  laura i got 18  matt okay you maintain the concentration referring to the blast from the skeletal dragon  earlier on all right so did you guys all roll stealth  sam stealth oh shit  laura plus ten  taliesin natural 20  marisha wait stealth  sam i rolled a two and a two so thats 15 and 15  joe how do i do this on /none/ this gloomstalker with the zombie how does this work  matt zombies not stealthed but it is undead gloomstalker its hard to be stealthed that  gloomstalker right now  sam were going inside we dont need it anymore  joe want me to leave it  sam i mean what are you going to do with a flying thing in a narrow stairway weve seen  inside we scryed inside its a very narrow stairway going up  laura can you have him climb up the side of the tower and meet you up top  sam oh yeah /none/ meet us up top under his breath he aint going to survive that  laura well we can try it though  travis he might  joe yeah i think that would work  matt okay you can do that  joe i hate it when you do that  liam i mean i love it but i hate it  taliesin also double checking grit is a reset after combat not a reset after a short rest  matt no its a short rest  taliesin short rest okay just checking  joe i have the wreath back on /none/ my neck correct because thats how it works i put it back on my  neck once were attuned  matt yeah you put it back on your neck once youve correct  joe okay they meet us at the top  matt okay as you step off and look into its eyes your eyes flare the bright yellow color and  the gloomstalker nods takes a step back and then leaps onto the side of the tower its claws  gripping in as it bats its wings it takes off and starts heading upward  joe circle at the /none/ top and wait for my command  matt it seems to acknowledge your command  joe all right now at disadvantage rolling in heavy plate  travis you got it  joe do i have a plus ten sweet yeah i got this all right nine 27  matt okay so 27 two and two 15 15 natural 20  marisha 29  liam oh it was a one but its a 37 now  laura because you rolled a luck what  liam no matt told me that because of reliable talent one means shit  matt he always /dung/ has a ten minimum  laura thats fucking badass 37  ashley 21  travis 22  matt all right so as you guys all dart in around this rot behemoth who pays no mind to your  presence you dart into the partially ajar doorway into the base of entropis the tower itself its  dark inside as soon as you all dart into the interior the doors are still partially open and  you can see the faint glow of the very low general light that encompasses the city of thar amphala  the normal greenishblue glow of /none/ the shield is offset a little bit by the natural light thats  coming through from the opening of the barrier that you guys have opened however the light  still diminishes as you step into this large chamber as soon as you enter the chamber those  of you with darkvision glance around and see its a big thoroughfare you see a large foyertype  chamber with pillars that go from bottom to maybe 25 30 feet up to a ceiling across the way you  can see two spiral staircases that curl upward and there maybe 30 or /none/ so humanoid figures that are  in the center of this chamber  sam what are they doing  matt well as soon as you guys step and turn around they all turn and look at you and begin  to sluggish footsteps  laura we need that orb  taliesin once theyre within range of us im going to wait  matt i mean a lot of them are going to be right up on you right now  joe can i sense what kind they are divine sense tell what type of fiend celestial or undead they are /none/  matt they are undead they appear to be mostly of the baseline skeletal or zombie variety its a  cluster of undead that are set here  taliesin okay im going to tug on the rope and pull it up and toss the gem right smackdab in the  center of us unless somebody else wants to throw it eh it doesnt matter i just yanked it  matt okay you yank it go ahead and make a roll see if its destroyed or not  taliesin nope its good  matt all right the stone clattering arcs in /none/ the center the blue pulseglow light billows out  you see the various skeletons and zombies charge into the light they stop and stare at it lets see  taliesin dc 15  liam 30 rolls  sam pike cant you kill masses of undead  matt okay so of the 30 or so about 20 of them stop and stare at the glow while you hear a  bounding heavy footfall sound behind where you came from  taliesin he was not still within range  matt no you pulled the stone from where you were inside the chamber /none/ now so hes now rushing  in after where the stone went  liam thisll still work spread and let him run right into the range of it  laura oh we can get out of the way and let him maybe run into the undead that are  liam as soon as he enters hes in range isnt he  matt possibly up to you guys but technically undead are still rushing in toward you and theyre  immediately scrambling with their claws and teeth out there lets say for the people at  front here its going to /none/ be probably the two of you who first made it in so three attacks against  each of you that is an 18 against you vax  liam no  matt that is a 20 against you  liam no  matt no that misses three against you natural 20 a 20  laura no  matt and a natural one all right so while they scramble at you and you push them back at bay one  of them does manage to get through its going to be 12 points of slashing damage against you vex  as one /none/ of them swings at you with a rusty blade that carves past you  laura okay  matt all right what are you guys doing  ashley how many of them about 30  matt about 30 of them yeah  liam pickle can you release a sarenrae bomb  ashley yeah ill take out my mace of disruption i dont want to use any more spells  matt you have your channel divinity your turn undead or destroy undead  laura yeah destroy undead  ashley do i want to wait  laura i dont know how many undead /town/ were going to face  liam vecnas going to be too powerful for a destroy or turn undead its for weakass shit  like this  laura but he might have you know i dont know what kind of army hes going to have up top so  its up to you  ashley well i have another one  laura so maybe do one of them  ashley so i can do it now yeah  matt okay so as you rush in toward where this pulse stone is as the crowd of undead are  gathered in you /none/ hunker down clutch your holy symbol and release a wave of divine energy the  whispers and prayer of sarenrae emanating from you like a caustic wave against undead energy whats  the dc on that  ashley its not written down  matt its your spell dc  laura oh 18  matt okay 18  sam wisdom intelligence or charisma  liam wisdom for clerics  sam has your wisdom gone up at all  liam eight plus five plus your proficiency bonus 14 20  laura youre at six proficiency bonus now youre not at  ashley /none/ i am i didnt know that  laura so your dc is 19 sorry matt  matt its okay i lost count even with their saves four undead survive as the shock wave  emanates out from you you watch as about two dozen of these various skeletons and zombies many  of which are grasping at you turn to ash one of them you see it reaching out toward you you get  a glimpse of it you can see this ones a fresher corpse one of the zombies it has dirty blonde  hair a torn chin with /none/ stubble and for a brief minute you can see it has this gash in its  stomach a partially eaten arm for a brief minute as it reaches out for you before the wave  hits youre like aldor turns to ash  marisha aldor  matt a member of the slayers take once the prized love of  sam felicia day  gasping  laura no  marisha no aldor  sam oh no  matt as the flash expands you glance around and you see a withered gnome corpse has been reaching  toward you mostly bald head /none/ in places you recognize this is one of your companions grubby  before the wave hits and he turns to ash  sam you just killed two of our friends pike  laura dont do that to her  ashley fuck off i didnt know  matt all of these are long dead as this burst of energy hits and all of a sudden dust and ash fill  the chamber around you  laura did it do anything to the rot behemoth coming in  matt the rot behemoth behind what is the dc on him  liam challenge /none/ rating of four or lower  matt yeah its higher than a challenge rating four so it doesnt affect him at all but the  four of you easy enough to cleave him down but well see if hes even affected by the stone so  the last four that are there as they charge into the stone nope none of them make their save so  the last four that are still there all stop and stare and glare at this stone in the center of the  chamber the rot behemoth comes looming in crashing whats the dc /none/  taliesin dc is 15  matt 14 does not make it by one  liam dont worry matt your luck is coming upstairs  matt thats true thats true so the rot behemoth crashing through the door and then  stays there staring at the stone blocking the doorway and holding it in place but now this  chambers open  laura should we kill this shit while were stunned  sam no we should just run up  laura how do we know were not going to run into a whole bunch more  taliesin which is why /none/ were going to keep the rope were going to go all the way up the stairs  and when were ready were going to tug like a motherfucker  laura okay and then all these things are going to chase after us  matt theyll keep following you every time you pull the stone theyre going to come toward you  laura so we might as well kill them now while theyre stunned  taliesin all right one at a time lets kill one at a time  sam the giants going to take more than one hit  taliesin /none/ yeah but were going to get him  matt well say easy enough for you guys to coordinate the skeletons are easy enough to  destroy the rot behemoth all in one swoop you guys can take down as one quick blast on it one  of the skeletons you also recognize a heavily charred zombie making a horrid sighing sound as  its sitting there staring at the stone you see the remains of vander  joe is he damaged  matt burnt to a cinder the last thing you saw was him being immolated and screaming  joe /dung/ id like to channel divinity and control undead  matt okay and with that before you destroy the zombie  joe its a wisdom save  matt wisdom save three nope youve got two zombies delilah and now your previous ally  vander turns from the stone wheezing  joe this is fucking dark  taliesin im really excited about the notion of a delilah potted plant  joe its my brothers character from our home group  liam you are now michonne from walking dead you got two zombies  travis bring them into the cru you got them /none/  joe zombie vander aw man this is like rattling whatever blackened heart my character has okay  liam all right well up we go then yeah  taliesin lets do this  liam im going to look for traps as we go  matt all right make an investigation check  sam everyone all healed up to full  laura and marisha no  sam should we pause and heal or  laura pause for 30 minutes and heal  travis vasselheim was just out the window  liam two miles away ish  matt whatd you roll  /none/ liam 18  matt 18 okay  sam if you take a potion youre full right dont you have your thing going or no is that gone  travis beacon of hope  laura beacon of hope just means it heals the max that a healing spell or a healing potion can do  you dont automatically go to full health  travis 2d8 16  sam oh i didnt know that  matt how long does beacon of hope last  liam one minute  matt beacon is gone  laura thats okay do you have a healing spell /none/ for people  ashley i do  travis are we doing a group thing right now  liam are we short resting or we doing little healies  laura i dont think we have 30 minutes  marisha we need a full 30 minutes to do a quick short rest  matt technically its a full hour by the rules i let it slide a little faster in times of  intensity id allow a 30minute quick rest but thats still  taliesin i would not say no to it but i can live without it  laura i dont /none/ know i mean theyre fighting at vasselheim right now  travis yeah were at the gates  marisha im at 94 hit points im down about 50 or so hit points  liam im telling you though its this or nothing if we fall here if we fail then its  fucked so even if it destroys half the city its better to have all of us at full fighting  potential  joe i would like to cast death ward on myself 4thlevel spell slot  matt okay  travis all right do it do the short rest just /none/ do it  sam wait were doing a short rest wait who needs it  taliesin we honestly all do  laura we all need healing im 40 points down  marisha im 50 points down and i burned both of my shape change who else is down far  travis a quarter or half of vasselheim is  sam dont you have a healing spell  ashley i do but it depends on the roll  sam no no because it maximizes it  laura no we dont have it anymore  ashley yeah so if i roll bad /none/ or  liam no but we have hit dice you dont need the spells  sam bye vasselheim  matt all right so you guys are taking a short rest in the inside of entropis  marisha no look super short  matt there is no supershort rest its a short rest  sam seems terrible  matt vasselheim was in sight when you were outside  marisha i dont know what do you want  matt im just letting you know  sam we have potions cant we drink potions  joe listen youre not going to need the /none/ potions after today im just saying  laura might as well take them  travis dont take your superior though  sam no we have other ones though  laura can you try healing and see what it does  ashley yeah ill do mass cure wounds on you guys  laura what does that do  marisha i dont know but we also we broke down the barrier so vasselheim can defend itself a  little more  travis onesixth of the pie  marisha im 50 points down and without my beast shape  laura you dont have /none/ beast shape  marisha i used it to go earth elemental because i thought the briarwood fight might be a little  bit more beefy than it was but i dont necessarily need it  travis vote as a group hand up if you want a short rest  sam no  travis no hands just put your hand up if you want it  taliesin i will admit it would do a lot for me  travis keyleth put your hand up  liam im going to put up because i think that these two need it  travis /none/ ill tiebreak it  laura so short rest short rest okay  sam vasselheim  marisha to quote the leaders of vasselheim they have defended themselves through many forms of battle  joe that vampires going to be up there full strength hes going to be back hes going to be  back full strength  laura he might not be back full strength yet  joe hell be back something  laura he takes a while to rest up  joe its 25 a minute isnt it  travis its super fast  matt he regenerates 25 well theres /none/ a lot of things at work here it depends roll a religion check  travis natural one  taliesin ill try a religion check  joe im a paladin with terrible religion skills blind faith  matt all right but still roll a religion check seeing as how undead is your domain  liam just roll a natural 20 joe  joe i rolled a natural 18  matt plus  joe zero for religion  matt okay okay you know this because of your experience with undead and amassing yourself a  necromantic energy since breaking your oath long /none/ ago when a vampire is reduced to zero hit points  and goes into mist form it has two hours to return to its resting place when it reaches its  resting place it has to rest for one hour once it rests for the one hour it goes back to one hit  point and then it regenerates 25 hit points or at least sylas every single round  liam roughly how much time has passed since we went from  matt id say 30ish minutes or so 30 or 40 because youve been slowly stealthing your way  /none/ through being careful  liam right right but probably his box of dirt is not  matt so if you take a short rest youre probably going to look at a sylas waiting for you somewhere  up top  laura its going to take two hours to get up the tower  sam its a big tower theres lots of shit up there  matt no meaning if you guys take a short rest he needs to rest for an hour it took you 40  minutes since that happened to get to the tower if you take a /none/ short rest youre going to have to  deal with a sylas  taliesin i mean fuck it if we heal ourselves  sam scanlans got healing scanlan twos got healing we can pump you guys up  travis because he also turns people right  taliesin he does turn people  travis i barely made that save  laura we need to not rest  taliesin how much heal do you get out of a potion  ashley whos bad  marisha im not great  ashley youre bad who else  joe i could use some seeing that /none/ i have tank duties  sam how many can you include  ashley okay is anybody down im going to do prayer of healing i want to save mass cure wounds  marisha im at 94 hit points so im down  joe im down 42 but i could probably heal  matt you could take a short rest but understand and be prepared with the knowledge of knowing that  youre also going put some things in your chamber that will be helpful against a vampire  sam scanlan two has tons of healing spells that he can use /none/ so use them hes going to be dead  soon anyway  marisha you guys dont want us losing any of our spellcasters right now im at 94 its not a lot  its not bad but its bad enough im a third of my hit points down  matt you do have a battery of lowlevel spell slots right now that can be used to heal things up  if you want to  sam yeah i can heal you and heal you and heal you until youre all done  marisha yeah but every time you heal me /none/ and heal me and heal me its taking away from something  else mechanically  sam its a level one bullshit spell slot  taliesin but its also healing that could be done in combat thats what were meaning  marisha im resigning my decision right now  matt make a choice here guys youre wasting time in the tower  sam no short rest heal some people ill heal some more we got this we got lots of healing  ashley okay ill just use a 2ndlevel for 16 points of healing for six people who need it  /none/ sam great  marisha 16 points ill take that  laura im taking one  sam i will take it as well  taliesin how many people have taken it so far  sam you said up to six people ill take that  marisha 110 im still 31 hit points down  sam i will cast healing word or scanlan two will cast healing word at 2ndlevel for you  marisha for me  sam yeah thats  matt you can use cure wounds as opposed to healing word  sam i dont have cure wounds  matt oh /none/ thats right never mind  sam thats nine more points for you  marish for me  sam yeah oh wait i can sing a song of rest  matt that takes a short rest to do  sam yeah that makes sense  marisha i could do my speech if i had a short rest  laura well you can do the speech as we climb up the tower  joe how much are you short shes 22 short  laura the speech does what does the speech regain hit points  matt ten minutes to say the speech /none/  laura so as we climb the tower she could be saying it  matt perhaps yeah  sam i will heal you another 2ndlevel healing spell  laura a greater healing potion is 4d4  matt youve got it 4d4 plus four  sam thats another 12 points  matt consider now as you guys climb the tower if you have any buff spells if you have any  longlasting things that you want to utilize for the coming fray freedom of movement death ward  all the things you guys want to prepare with nows the time to /none/ do it  marisha 141 im full  liam im going to when were right on the verge when we think were right on the verge im  blessing you and you  travis i think this is the verge  marisha is this the verge because if this is the verge  matt you still have the tower to climb but know if you have spells like buffs to cast that  arent concentration and last a while nows the time to do it  marisha like an hour a while  joe tiamat gave her 12 im going /none/ to give 18 to myself out of my healing pool  marisha pike and i burn all of our 4th level spell splots to do  ashley splots  marisha splots do all of our spell splots to cast freedom of movement on anybody with the  exception of percy who already has it  joe what does freedom of movement do  matt wait how many slots is that for you guys then  marisha three each  matt three each okay  marisha except we didnt account for  sam scanlan two  marisha or arkhan  joe /none/ whats happening  matt okay anything else you want to buff with  laura yes im going to invoke my blessing of the dawnfather  matt okay  marisha oh my god  matt no death wards  joe i did  matt you did death ward to yourself  travis she has a death ward  ashley wait a second one of us is without freedom of movement  laura scanlan two  taliesin i have it automatically  marisha he has it automatically  ashley understand  laura can anybody cast some death wards too  joe wait /none/ i didnt get freedom of movement  sam taliesin and marisha no  sam we did it with an earring sorry you werent on  joe im over kicking a can in the corner  sam were all on iphones and youre on a windows phone  ashley i dont have another 4thlevel unless i burn a 5thlevel for death ward  joe now i have some funky shit i have a cleansing touch anyway that can end a spell on  me or any willing creature that i touch so that should help  matt so whats the plan /none/ guys  sam wait were doing things that last an hour  laura were doing things yeah were doing it  sam shit  marisha i mean i dont know unless we want to try and get higher up before we go  matt thats up to you guys  marisha do we think this is it are we sure this is it  liam is it one of these guys where we can see the height of the tower or  matt you cant see the height of the tower it goes up into another floor  marisha okay /none/ so this means anything we encounter if its not fucking vecna then were  barreling through it and going straight up because weve burned everything  matt if you want to hold your spells until you get higher ill let you do that up to you  liam theres a death knight  marisha i dont know whats worth it do we have any idea of how much higher this tower goes  matt i mean it goes pretty high  liam oh excuse me where is vecna right now how high up  matt right above you  liam /none/ right above us way up or a floor up  matt way up  liam way up okay  marisha do we want to try and jog another ten minutes before doing this  taliesin lets get halfway up the tower  marisha okay okay before we burn everything  matt just letting you guys be prepared here because youre vox machina  marisha okay were going to go ten more minutes up and im going to give a speech as we go  laura so im invoking the blessing as we get closer  ashley does anybody else want /none/ death ward  taliesin no im good  marisha i say okay guys as we climb this tower i know theres a lot of stairs but the  stairs are going to be fucking nothing compared to vecna but holy fuck these are a lot of fucking stairs  sam this is inspiring  taliesin the stairs are a metaphor  marisha the stairs are a metaphor each stair that we get across is going to be like another  step further into defeating vecna you know with each stair im winded  laura the stairs are long but theyre /none/ not infinite  marisha the stairs are long but they are not infinite be good and now were almost there  guys were almost there this is it this is it sobbing and panting  laura i feel so inspired keyleth thank you  sam wow that was so inspiring  marisha this is it you guys just keep going up the stairs and thats my speech  matt okay take your 17 no 19  marisha 19 hit points  matt 19 temporary hit points including you  joe 19 temporary yeah  marisha and theyre temporary not  /none/ laura in addition to our plus two so now we have 21  marisha do we heal above that  matt yeah well you get temporary hit points like a buffer shield  marisha right so those 19 go first  matt correct okay  laura oh god oh god oh god okay are we getting near the top  joe let me know because im going to throw up  travis who wants the death ward  marisha yeah and pike and i cast whenever seems appropriate  matt right  travis but who wants it who needs it /none/  sam i mean whos going to die  taliesin this one definitely  laura okay heres the thing the people that have the trammels should probably have a death  ward too  travis ive got my one hit point regenerate regenerate regenerate  laura okay youre good  sam pike can have one  ashley i have my armor  laura okay so that bumps you back up once youve gone down once so really he needs and you  well no you wont come back right away  liam if i have the death ward i will /none/ pop back up  matt there is only one person that can complete the incantation of sealing  sam thats me  travis sealing of what oh the trammels  matt once the trammels are in  travis youve got to put it on scanlan  taliesin he has to do it without scanlan everything goes to shit  liam what about scanlan two can scanlan two do it  sam technically hes not going to last that long guys  ashley i cast death ward on scanlan  sam pike i accept your blessing  ashley scanlan if we /none/ get through this you know what that means dont you  sam no what does it mean  taliesin it means that your clones going to get very lucky you on the other hand no  ashley youll just have to live you wait and find out  sam well what does it mean what could it mean  ashley just live youll see  sam just then the real scanlan comes back from peeing hes like whatd i miss guys  laughter  matt ascending the stairs you climb and climb the spiral continuing upward both of the stairs /none/  spiral upward so which direction did you take the right or the left  laura the right no wait which hand does vecna chop off  matt the left  travis what does your speech do keyleth again  marisha it gives you an additional 19 hit points temporary hit points so add plus 19 on top when  you lose them theyre gone huh  sam were trying to decide whether we went left or right up the stairs  taliesin we went right  matt okay you spiral upward and upward and upward climbing an extremely long /none/ period of time  your legs begin to ache a little bit then another floor opens up it appears the tower is  now divided into two chambers from the bottom floor up its now two sides to a tower and youre  on the right side the hallway curves around the outer edge of the tower on the opposite side you  can see the staircase continues upward the interior of this chamber appears to be an  incredible arcane laboratory occupying the center space of the tower inside you see six overlapping  circles of dulled runes and /none/ glyphs that encompass the entire 30foot walkway between here and the  stairs shelves and tables of countless glass tubes and metallic vices lay out across tables  organized in a nearocd pattern tomes and books line the inner chamber walls what do you guys do  liam i use divine sense and feel for undead 60 feet  matt you sense around no undead in the 60foot radius  laura does this feel like it might be delilahs room her chamber  matt you dont know  taliesin from where i am can i recognize any of the book /none/ titles any of it  matt from where you are now you cant even see its too far away  laura is there any traps in this room  matt you can check for traps  liam fan out  joe can you sense vecna  taliesin yes if vecna moves we will know  laura what is that investigation  matt investigation  liam 24 for me  laura 14 for me  matt okay i mean theres symbols across the ground here but they seem pretty inert three of  the circles in the center of the chamber /none/ appear to be ready to trigger by proximity a fivefoot  proximity  liam wheres the exit to this room  matt its across the way around the outside of the tower wall so you can follow along  liam we can go around the edge  matt most of you can its a very tight walk to get through you have a few large individuals  liam whats making that so tight is there one trap thats making it so tight or all of them  matt there are three large circles that overlap with each other that are /none/ triggerable and then  there are three inert ones that overlap its like a series of venn diagrams  liam did they seem arcane in nature  matt yes they do  liam do i have a shot in hell of disarming them  travis i take out the immovable rod and have it in my hand  matt okay make an intelligence check  liam natural 20  matt these traps are far beyond your understanding to disable  liam okay okay  matt you glance at these and go oh this is bad  travis we would need /none/ dispels  laura what if we go no the people that are small go around ill bamf trinket out on one  side put grog in go back put arkhan in go back we work our way around the runes  sam what about the zombies  laura the zombies are little they can work their way around  sam no no his slave zombies  taliesin theyre little  travis his dead brother and  joe aw man i wasnt thinking about it until you brought it up again like i was actually in an  okay place  /none/ travis im sorry i thought you know

and hit me in the head with it  matt i need everybody except for arkhan and grog to go ahead and make a general dexterity check  laura oh fuck i thought we would be able to avoid it natural 20  taliesin 24  matt okay  sam scanlan two /none/ is okay he made a 17 scanlan one had a one  matt okay so whatd you get  marisha oh i had to roll  matt everybody except for arkhan and  marisha oh everyone but for them dex save  liam oh whos near me could i retcon and say that im  matt dexterity check you add your dexterity modifier  liam what did you get you got a natural one  matt scanlan did yeah  liam if im next to him because i give plus two to saves does that futz with it  matt /none/ its not an ability check its a saving throw one is an autofail for a saving throw  joe they werent within ten feet of me were they  matt no next would have been partially across because you couldnt get across youre too wide  joe fair enough  marisha 13  matt okay thats fine and you got a four okay so as you guys are moving across scanlan  and pike you both are clustered next to each other unfortunately pike begins to wobble you  reach to grab her and pull her in but the armored /none/ weight is too strong and you both accidentally  step out of place at which point the glyph to your left suddenly flares you watch as in a  flash of sudden arcane energy a cage of forcelike power encompasses the both of you in a  cube you see these bars of crackling energy lighting crackle around youre both currently  stuck within this arcane entrapment the gnomes  laura can scanlan two dispel that shit  sam i dont know dispel magic  marisha can you dimension door  sam good question if only the person in here /none/ with me was also of gnome size oh wait she is  well dimension door out  liam do we want to try to get everyone else across before you do that maybe its a  onetimeonly  laura everybody else went already  matt well theyre currently blocking the path now with this cage  liam oh okay well i meant the necklace but  sam i dont know how this spell works i hope it works we might get hit on the way out  matt okay as you clasp pike and complete the incantation i need you /none/ to make a charisma saving throw  travis come on buddy come on come on  sam a charisma save is this magic  matt it is  sam okay 20  matt 20 20 will do it  sam ive never had to make a charisma saving throw before  taliesin you got very high  matt so as you grab her and you both begin to transport outside of the cage you feel the force  of it push back but the nature of your innate magical ability manages to puncture through that  threshold and then both /none/ of you reappear at the opposite side no worse for wear the cage is  still present though and its now blocking the path across  the rest of you get across fine its the gnomes that got stuck and now the two of you are  on the opposite end you have 30 feet between you and the opposite side and that walkway  is entirely closed off  joe we can do this  travis yeah im not worried one bit  sam wait did you switch your boots  travis i did  laura you can spider /none/ climb to the ceiling  travis do you want to cirque du soleil this thing well hold arms and ill walk on the  ceiling  sam two shirtless hunky dudes holding each other in crazy poses  liam definitely take your armor off for this though definitely  marisha not for any particular reason  taliesin we still have the pot you could get some oil and really make this work  joe my answer to your question was cut to  travis yeah i will walk up on the wall so that im sticking out  taliesin thats /none/ a lot of powerful  joe oh i have four fingers  matt okay the force cage encompasses too much of the wall space to go sideways so youll have to  go across the ceiling  travis because i was inverted bullshit top gun thank you  matt as you climb the top and you pull arkhan you tuck your feet up underneath  travis treat me like your fucking dragons french girl whatever  liam paint me like one of your chromatic girls  joe you like volleyball bro just thinking if we make it out of here /none/ we should play some beach  volleyball some time  travis hand wraps get some aviators itd be totally cool  matt could you both please make athletics checks for me  travis im still raging  matt yeah youve been raging this whole time youre the most intense spotter right now  joe this is an athletics check  matt yes  joe 22  travis 25  matt step by step you carry the heavy armored redscaled dragonborn across the threshold of the  chamber you release him and both safely come to the opposite side of the /none/ laboratory  laura good job guys  liam is it hot in here  travis not a problem what happened to you guys  joe did you guys see that  sam yes we did  matt you continue up the stairs  all yes  liam point of order i know roughly how far vecna is right so i should be able to tell as were  getting closer roughly how much distance halfway up the tower three quarters et cetera  matt you guys are based on far youve climbed youre about halfway up the tower  taliesin /dung/ i would like to do one thing before we leave the room i would like to take something  set it on fire and toss it on those books over there  liam oh thats dark  laura nice  marisha were holding on our freedom of movement right we decided that until we get higher  liam how long did it take us to get to this point  matt id say a little over ten minutes or so of continuous climbing  liam who knows what is above us it could be slower for the upper half  /none/ sam fire stays where it is typically it doesnt move up  laura were fine i like it  taliesin theres nothing else to catch fire in here itll be nice  travis is there anything else to catch fire that would travel upward toward us as were climbing a  towering inferno  matt its a stone chamber  sam full of chemicals  taliesin itll be noxious but brief i take a torch i actually have one last whitestone seal  thats flashpowdered wrap it light it and toss it on the counter  matt okay it clatters /none/ and the torch burns the powder flaring  taliesin thatll do walk away  matt you guys continue up the next set of spiral stairs climbing higher and higher up entropis  you can see every now and then one of the various veinlike cracks of energy thats holding  the tower together you can glance out and see very obscured movement in the distance its too  fractured too much diffraction  continuing upward you come to a second or another floor about four minutes of climbing  this next halfchamber you see dozens of sets of chains and /none/ manacles affixed to the walls where  tortured corpses are currently dangling from them left in pieces the scent is terrible decay is strong  liam i cast divine sense undead  matt no undead  liam traps  matt go ahead and make an investigation check  liam 18  matt okay no traps in this chamber  taliesin do we recognize any of the corpses  matt make a perception check  taliesin i had to do it natural 20  marisha oh no  taliesin i get to know the rest of you dont get to know /none/  matt most of the corpses around here have been mutilated to the point where its hard to even  recognize this was essentially a torture chamber this was a gathering information this was a  pointmaking chamber the ones you do see around here nothing catches your eye one does seem  familiar you look and see and its been a while but you remember the face of a scalebearer desona  who traveled across the ozmit sea with you aboard a skyship glancing around the bodies appear to  have been cleaned of any useful items this is /none/ mainly a forutilityandfun chamber  travis any weapons or items besides the chains and manacles on the floor  matt the room is clean  liam how far above us is vecna  matt about 120 feet  laura we should cast it now we should do all of our casting  marisha okay  laura now i invoke the blessing of the dawnfather  travis call it out  marisha im waiting for pike  ashley lets do it  matt okay doing a round of what spells to who  marisha freedom of movement to scanlan one myself /none/ vax  matt so only three freedoms of movement  sam thats all she has right  marisha thats all ive got from keyleth  matt from keyleth right and then pike  ashley freedom of movement on vex grog and pike  liam im putting the wings out now  matt the raven wings emerge pike you said you were doing death ward  laura oh yeah she did it on scanlan  ashley death ward at a 5thlevel  matt okay so 5th slots taken  sam scanlan will invoke the blessing of the knowing mistress  matt /none/ you watch as the forehead space where once you had seen the briefly visible third eye of  ioun now emblazoned like a lantern light this bright purple eye in that moment you watch as  scanlans pupils turn to silver  laura whoa are you still you  sam i cant see anything everythings silver oh god im blind im just kidding i can see fine  taliesin i charge diplomacy up  ashley and i will invoke the blessing of the everlight  matt and with that you watch as this bright light emerges from the back of /none/ pikes shoulders as  a familiar but much more vibrant and strong set of divine golden wings not made of energy but  visibly beautiful gold feathered wings expand from her back your feet lift off the ground and  whooshing as the voice of sarenrae whispers into her ear im with you  ashley squealing okay thank you  laura i bamf trinket out  matt bear noises  laura if you want to polymorph him  sam nows the time polymorph only lasts is it an hour or ten minutes ive got to learn this  matt polymorph /none/ i think is an hour with concentration could be wrong but i think it is  do note you still have another series of staircases that are pretty tight  laura okay we should go up we should keep going  liam also im going to say this now in advance it might not be possible but if we get to a door  im thinking ahead of time if we think were about to step out i want to cast bless on the  three halfelves right before going out that might not be possible but its in my /none/ head to do it  matt okay good to keep in mind  joe we should send delilah in first  sam yeah sure  marisha thats actually a good idea  sam scanlan two is going to dump a 3rdlevel spell into the tome of isolation to reveal the  hidden text is it only revealed to scanlan two or is it revealed to everyone  matt let me see the item again well the text remains for an hour yep  liam youre blessed if it happens hashtag blessed a d4 rolled for every attack or saving throw /none/  matt once the text is revealed technically anybody with any sort of penchant for arcane  knowledge could attempt it but you have the best chance  laura so you dont need to do that  sam no i do need to to reveal the text its hidden otherwise  matt correct but the text is revealed for an hour if in theory you were to fall and the  book could be found  travis i got it ill pick it up and start reading  matt yep its more difficult but its possible  sam i have /none/ a book i need to read  marisha its possible but uncertain noise is what his face was  matt because he was the chosen of ioun he can read without issue but the text itself is still  very arcane in nature  laura hes the only one that can finish the sealing  marisha right then keyleth turns to vax whatever happens lest it be trite stay with us  casts guidance for the next minute which gives you 1d4 on ability checks  laura right before we go out you mean  marisha yeah before we move /none/ just for the start of it  matt you guys begin to climb up the next staircase all right youre beginning to spiral  up the next length of it you get about 80 or so feet up before are you leading this charge  visibly  travis actually delilah is  matt youre sending delilah ahead of you  laura when we get up to the top  matt as youre coursing around the edge the stairs stop into another chamber the chamber  levels off  liam up so that were seeing the edge of steps at the /none/ top all right im stealthing  matt okay make a stealth check  joe very quickly grog give me another longsword for zombie vander  travis last one i have you got it  liam are we pass without a trace right now 44  matt 44 so you stealth up around the edge and you see now where once it was divided into two  chambers it now seems the chambers converged once more into a single room its not very big and  the towers been slowly tapering the higher up you go the room is fairly empty /dung/ you see a few vases  in the corners and some basic ancient decor standing not noticing youre there you see three  figures in full dark armor similar to who you fought in the ziggurat or the one who was  guarding the tunnel that led up into thar amphala  liam they dont look like the big kahuna they look like the underlings  matt the underlings you see them in the same dark horned armor theres one thats humanoid  sized and one that looks to be halfling size or two of them halfling size  liam /none/ from my hidden position i want to see if i see any traps in the room  matt make an investigation check for the immediate entry  liam im not entering i want to do it from my peeky spot  matt for the immediate entry for what you can see you cant investigate from across the room  travis theyre facing away from us  matt theyre not facing away but they dont seem to acknowledge his presence yet they dont see him  liam yeah 23 for investigation  matt you dont see any traps in the immediate /none/ vicinity of the room  liam so what im going to do is slowly back down to the party relate what i just saw three of  them what do we do  sam standard undead  laura no theyre death knights  matt theyre not death knights  liam theyre dudes in armor theyre lackeys  taliesin are they humans or undead  matt cant tell fully armored  joe how far up the stairs  matt from where you guys are right now theyre about 30 feet around the way and then ten feet  into the chamber /none/  joe ill divine sense which is up to 60 feet are they fiends celestial or undead  matt nope  joe it looks like theyre human  liam is it difficult to use that silenced weapon of yours  taliesin once i use it ive got ten minutes of silence i was curious that if i get close enough  to vecna he cant talk i was hoping to save that because that might be a thing where we can  keep him from casting vocal spells  marisha can we stealth around them and not fight them at /none/ all  liam its a small room you and i can probably handle two but that leaves a third  matt you see one staircase one final staircase that winds around the corner actually you  havent seen it yet  travis theres no chance you could remove the stone from the middle of the floor and have them fall  marisha thats what i was looking for can keyleth take a peek and see whats up  matt make a stealth check  marisha yeah  taliesin plus ten  marisha do you still have that  liam yeah /none/  marisha dope thats real good 39  matt 39 as you curl around the edge and glance inside you recognize this chamber when you  scried in here previously this was the chamber that was being left by the death knight as he  ascended to the top of the tower this is the last stop  marisha inarticulate yelling okay  laura can you open up the floor underneath them  marisha does it look like the floor opens  matt it doesnt look like its a trap door or anything  laura its stone could you open /none/ the floor and let them fall  liam could stubby and i each target one and you yank one into the ground simultaneously can you  do that right now  sam i could hold one  taliesin lets have you two take some out and send the big guys in  marisha its worked stone  matt its all worked stone its all very carved  sam i could hold one paralyze one of them  travis if we dont think the room or the setup will fuck us up the big boys can go in and  probably /none/ handle it or we can follow your attacks  liam we dont want to create a stir we might so its better that we do two quietly and leave one  left can you throw your fucking manners ball at the third  taliesin its better against weaker opponents  laura its a thin staircase three people wont be able to attack at once  taliesin ill have ten minutes of silence  matt two at most would be able to strike at once  laura so you and me go up sneak attack fall back and let somebody run /none/ in and take it out yeah  liam yeah so whos going in  matt you have the taller one in the center and the two smaller ones flanking  laura well take the smaller ones  travis i would send in the dragonborn because theyre all alive  joe yeah  laura get ready to fight once we take the two out  liam tell me again the three that are in this room  matt theres a humansized one in the center and two halflingsized ones on either side  travis jocks machina does not get hazed  /none/ joe stop bullying jocks machina  liam arkhan were going to handle the small right after youll handle the tall  joe sounds good to me  laura we sneak up is it autocrit if its a sneak attack  matt if theyre surprised  laura okay are they surprised  liam i stealthed you have to stealth right  matt you have to stealth  laura okay 29  liam i will go a split second before my sister  matt both of you guys curl up to the edge and you see the three of them what are /none/ you doing  laura were attacking the two smallest  liam throwing on the right throwing on the left  matt youre attacking the one on the right and youre the one on the left go ahead and roll your  attacks  laura is it autocrit  matt if it hits its an autocrit but you have advantage on the attack because they dont know  youre there  laura oh thats good 30 on the first hit  matt that hits  liam they all hit thats good four  laura oh my god i rolled four sixes /none/ and a five  liam im doing okay too  laura 29 times two is what  sam both of you guys got big damage  joe what is it 29 times two  matt thats 58  laura 58 plus eight so 64 66  liam 80 for the first  laura thats the first attack  matt all right so a second attack for each of you  laura 19  matt that hits  liam 12 for my second  matt does not hit  liam no they all hit all my attacks hit 12 damage for /none/ the second  matt okay whats the damage on the second one  laura 18 on the second  matt both of the armored ones on the side take the hit and crumple fall back helmet falling  off unconscious  laura i immediately move to the side so he can run through  joe so the guy turns around and im whoosh  matt theyre still in the center of the chamber theyre about 15 feet from the top of the stairs  the two of you are going to rush in arkhan you rush in towards the one /none/ in the center go for it  sam unleash everything  joe i dont think i can reach i dont think im in range did you see that  matt so whatd you roll  sam right as he runs scanlan says dont fuck this up  matt as they both drop you rush up to the one in the metal armor who doesnt react to your  arrival stands there staring at you as you rush forward and swing you hit the armor but you hit  the edge of the blade cleaves off doing no impact  laura /none/ does he move  joe thats attack one okay thats a 21  matt 21 hits  taliesin that looked bad from this angle yeah i see it now holy cow  joe hes not undead hes not undead is he  matt hes not undead nope  joe okay well this is going to be weird then oh thats not bad thats 28  matt 28 all right you hack and the axe slides into the front of the breast plate and as you pull  back you see a gout of blood he takes it not reacting  /none/ joe just stands there  taliesin maybe we shouldnt kill all of  joe i would like to bonus action  matt okay  joe no i wouldnt im not  laura why isnt he moving does he have a helmet on  matt yeah the one standing has a helmet and the two that fell their helmets tumbled off as they  impacted and fell back  ashley what do they look like up there when their helmets came off  laura oh no were they our friends  joe what friends  laura pull the helmet off arkhan /none/ pull the helmet off  joe i pull the helmet off  matt you pull the helmet off and you watch immediately a bit of black fuzzy facial hair from  underneath as you reveal you see darkened skin and long black hair with a bit of colored makeup  under the eyes and a metal band across the forehead looking ahead unmoving unflinching  locked in place staring past you  laura is it gilmore  matt you glance up and its gilmore standing in the middle of the room  laura we killed the two  travis no /none/ we dont know anything yet  joe i command zombie delilah and zombie vander to go to the heads and take the helmets off the two  heads on the ground  matt the helmets are partially off so its easy enough to slip the helms off to the left it was  less of a halfling and more of a younger girl jammed into the armor and a little taller than the  other you can see brown hair with a shock of white in it currently laying back unmoving and  bleeding out the other one looks to /none/ be specifically gnomish short brown hair and eyes  wide on the ground  sam highpitched is that my girl is that my baby girl  ashley i think its an illusion im hoping i dont know i feel this cant be real  sam its my baby girl  ashley im going in can i stand over one of the bodies and do a perception check a medicine check  matt make a medicine check  travis no theres no way  ashley 23  matt 23 theyre not illusions and they are both dead  joe i cut /none/ the head off of the one in the middle  laura no dont do it arkhan dont  ashley no i stand in front of him and say no please dont  matt they still have the bands each one of them has this strange brass band across the head  ashley i take my mace and i slowly try to take one of the bands off  matt you take it off the head of one of the two dead  ashley yeah but not touching it scraping it off  matt it slides off  ashley does anything /none/ happen  laura can we cast revivify on them  travis dont do that  sam yeah do that  laura who is it who are they for sure  matt it is kaylie and cassandra  laura its kaylie and cassandra  sam revivify them take the bands off and revivify them  taliesin what is the band before we do anything  sam take it off of gilmore hes still alive  taliesin this may kill him  matt no she took it off one of the front  ashley does gilmore look like hes still alive  /none/ matt hes wounded but hes still alive and staring forward  ashley ill do the same thing  matt you pull the band off and the eyes flicker for a second panting what happened where am  i how  joe i pull the axe back  matt what happened  marisha he doesnt know  sam save her right now  joe i put my hand up over his mouth  taliesin take them  ashley its okay  matt he looks down  ashley i stand over kaylie and i cast revivify  matt you see the eyes /none/ lull back the stillness of the body as you finish touching the body a warm  burst gasps breath comes back to her and she starts coughing sits up and leans over gasping  sam i go grab her and hold her  ashley i stand over cassandra and i cast revivify  sam these are big spells arent they  matt as you reach out and touch her chest the brief moment of stillness leads as her eyes slowly  blink back and begins breathing again  travis this is some seven shit right here  laura that is /none/ so fucked up  sam shaun can you get them out of here  matt yes i  laura how did you get here is it really you  liam do you remember anything shaun  marisha anything that can help us  matt i was in my workshop and there was a flash of light a doorway opened and it pulled me  through and  laura can i roll an insight check and see if its him  matt roll an insight check  liam im taking him by the cheeks youre in a very bad place youre /none/ in a very bad place and  time you need to get out of here you need to take these women and go downstairs and hide  laura 21  matt 21 its shaun gilmore  liam you are in no shape to do anything right now you need to take these two women and hide  downstairs do you hear me  matt where are we whats going on  liam theres no time to explain  marisha were in the tower of entropis were on the back of a titan try to get them as far away  /none/ from here as possible vasselheim is an hour away  laura or you can fight with us  liam no his head is not where it needs to be  matt wait so if were in were near vasselheim whats entropis  marisha no were in thar amphala its been teleported to the back of a titan which is a  giant mountain which is what were on its from the shadowfell you just have to get away  laura were 15 feet below vecna hes right above us  matt then what are you going to do  laura /none/ were going to fight him  marisha and youre going to go away  liam in 30 minutes we could all be dead but if we have any chance you three need to not be  here you need to go down now  matt i can get the three of us away i can teleport us its the maximum of what i can do  marisha jmon sa ord is here the slayers take has probably been vastly compromised just get out  of here get to the woods scanlans right  matt i can probably take us back /none/ to emon why even stay here  marisha then go go  matt ill do that youre going to fight this vecna  taliesin i hate to even ask but is there anything you can do and still  matt if we make it quick  travis id almost rather him stay and fight  sam no hes got to get them away theyre at one hit point each  matt if you can make this quick i can leave you with some intense adrenaline my friend  travis me  matt yes  travis im a fan of adrenaline /none/  matt he looks around to the blood on the floor and the two barely living women at his side and  says if the one youre going to fight is the one that did this to me and them leave a scar in my  name if you dont mind when its done maybe carve a unicorn  travis with pleasure  matt you begin to hear heavy footsteps coming up the stairs behind you heavy footfalls and a  number of other footsteps heading up the tower behind you he goes and grabs the bodies close  glancing /none/ around you up the stairway you see emerging the death knight who joined you in the  fight against vecna  sam i grab kaylie by the face and i say to her goodbye  matt the one that met you at the top of the tower last time you fought vecna emerges looks across  and begins to go for the blade  joe i go straight for him  matt you go straight for him  joe with the death knight straight for him  matt gilmore reaches out to you and casts haste on you  travis /none/ haste  gasps  matt but it lasts a minute hurry  marisha i hate to say this but arkhan do you have him  joe get upstairs ill hold him off  marisha lets go  liam bless shaun it was an honor knowing you  matt it will be an honor knowing you all still grabbing on to both of the girls and with a flash  of light the three of them vanish the death knight has turned to reach out and goes to cast  something arkhan rushes up and slams the axe across his arm /none/ knocking it aside you can see  now behind them other cultists and other things begin to head up the stairs but theyre currently  being choked at this point where the death knights being held at the stairway where arkhan  is stepping there  joe zombies are grabbing for his arms  matt as arkhan holds off you guys head up towards the top of the tower thats where were  going to pick up next week  screaming  travis what did you do you kevin spacey from seven mother fucker what did you do  matt /none/ when you revealed to a god how close and dangerous you were last game there were going to  be
