town	 hills until a flash of yellow hair hoofbeats  a fastmoving horse a young human woman riding at top speed through the windy night she barrels  down the street muttering to herself shit shit shit im late again  then suddenly a thunk the horse whinnies did she just hit something or someone oh no the  young woman stops dismounts walks back and sees an awful sight an old woman in a simple grey  robe cane in a mangled hand face bloody arm broken shes motionless ashen oh fuck says  the girl oh my fuck i 
none	 think i is that a i just killed someone oh gods what am i going to  do i am so dead the young woman looks around no one to call for a doctor no firelit homes to  knock on for help  wait no lights no prying eyes no witnesses the rider takes a breath kicks a little snow over  the body of the old woman checks the streets one more time and then mounts the horse and gets the  hell out of there no one the wiser she rides on feeling guilty but also relieved 
town	 no one saw  right right  in a few minutes she arrives at her destination shivering with cold she ties her horse to the  lion statue across the street just in time for her shift at the second crappiest tavern in town  the ass sailor the sign above the door once said the crass sailor but months ago vandals pried  off the shitty letters cr so now it just reads the ass sailor the name seems to have resonated  with its lowlife patrons and they seem to prefer it  the poorly built tavern sits 
none	 on the foundation of an old chapel and some time in the last hundred  years was expanded to two stories a pub on the bottom and rooms above despite its thin walls it  has one feature that regulars love on nights like this it is notoriously warm  the woman pushes open the door jogs past the ass sailors source of heat a large hearth blurred  with red coals its a small fireplace but no matter where you sit in the ass sailor you always  stay weirdly warm so toasty in fact that theres a massive 
dung	 pile of jackets and scarves and  weapons to the left of the door everyone inside has stripped down to the bare minimum of dress  with the lack of clothing comes an oversupply of skin skin of all shades and body parts the ruddy  belly of a human salesman stuffing himself on rotten mutton the dark bluetinted shoulder of a  tiefling whore enticing a gray bearded older man upstairs the gray forearm of a halforc  merchant drawing a mug of greep from the keg on the bar greep by the way is a homemade house  
tavern	 liqueur its so potent its nickname is kindling because it is also extremely flammable hint  hint hint  liam red barrels everywhere  sam youre late calls the bar manager xavier wiping his hands on his grubby chefs apron  i hit some unexpected traffic on the road replies your lateshift bartender valerie as she  puts on her apron and ducks behind the bar there are a dozen tables most populated with drunken  assholes halfwitted con artists and infectious laughter val gets right to work on a night that  will prove to be unlike any other 
tavern	  at the bar a noble halfelf woman with fiery eyes dark skin and spectacular blonde hair  nervously fidgets with her necklace she glances about looking for someone in an elegant blue  and white gown and golden jewelry she is definitely out of place among the riffraff this  we will learn is gryffin  val the bartender approaches hi so what can i get you  mary what is your name  sam valerie hi  mary hello do you have any scotch  sam well no i have a menu  mary you do  sam

none	 a drink for now if  thats all right  sam all right ill let you know if he arrives  mary thank you so much i do appreciate that val  sam just then a tall female humanoid with rippling biceps and long whiskers takes the next  stool over shes covered with tan and orange fur which is unsurprising because she is tabaxi a  catwoman her feline face is bandaged from recent battles and she snarls with an imposing posture  that says dont fuck with me this is clothesline val approaches oh hey  clothesline the 
tavern	 usual i assume  ashly do you have the milk that i ordered  sam yes val takes out a saucer of warm milk and puts it on the bar oh and heres some  spice too she places a box of crimson powder on the bar it is catnip  ashly thanks val  sam what happened to your face  ashly oh you know its a funny story i clotheslined some people  sam oh thats  ashly yeah and their nails were not cut generally when you clothesline someone you clicks  tongue go but they caught

none	 as they speak over at a small table a young human girl sits alone peering out of her hooded  cloak she has almost translucent skin and snowy wisps of white hair fall over her face her cool  blue eyes reveal a quiet confidence but she seems guarded and keeping her back to the wall not  touching her glass of water this is jayne strolling over to the table with a wobbly gait  is a short elven man with gray skin gray hair and a black leather choker he wears a sour  expression and projects abject 
dung	 apathy he reeks of booze and appears to be wearing dark red eye  makeup this is kingston and it looks like kingston is approaching jayne  brian evening  liam oh hello  brian do you come here a lot  liam no i am traveling actually  brian alone  liam yes  brian by what mode of transportation are you traveling  liam well have a seat ill tell you everything lets start with my childhood  brian great do you want a drink  liam no and that was irony i could have something to eat

none	 that doesnt matter because youve got light coming out of your ass on the walls are  graffiti seemingly from patrons whove wandered down here one reads for a good time do not  call isabelle another reads do you know why they call him obby the rat because his dick is  the size of a rodent and the other one says what do you call a pile of tabaxi a meowntain  brian respect  sam straight on at the bottom of the steps a narrow corridor leading out around a slight  bend obscuring the view to 
tavern	 the other direction its a dead wall however there is a space  underneath the back of the stairway it is dank and cold light frost covers the floor because  you are out of that hot bar now so you would like to continue down this hall  liam yeah im looking as carefully as i can into the next space i will peer for enemies or the  people were following or anything  sam okay this curves this way and leads to a door the corridor proceeds around to the left as  you proceed through it 
none	 clothesline has to bend a little to make it through frankfurt feels roomy  it ends with a simple wooden door and a rusty knob are you still in the same marching order  kingston first or kingston second  liam i call down over my shoulder and say hey ass kicker  sam thats you  liam no its not clothesline get up here  brian im ass flicker  ashly fuck you i dont follow your orders you tried to kill me  mary i want to investigate whats under the stairs  ashly i dont even know 
none	 why im still here  sam so nobody is going with you right now jayne youre in front of a door gryffin can you roll  an investigation check  liam and im going to do my best to see if theres any kind of trap on the door im looking at  mary 18  sam 18 yes all right there is a false wall here that opens up into another corridor that  leads this way let me see how i described it yes okay it empties out into a wider room and  im going to do 
none	 this all right so what would you like to do  mary can i check to see if theres any trace of footprints or anything  sam sure roll a perception check  mary winces im not going to waste that though ten  sam ten thats what you needed so there is frost everywhere its super cold down here  because were underground in a cellar area and its winter yeah now youre also getting cold  brian i dont have a fucking shirt on  mary your nipples are rockhard  brian good thing theyre pierced  sam 
none	 gryffin you notice that theres less frost on the floor under the stairs and through this  hallway than on the rest of the downstairs area  mary are there any footprints that i can see  sam there are no footprints if anything its just a straight line you also notice something  else two things actually would you like the one on the left or the one on the right  mary left please  sam left read that out loud  mary oh theres a fucking snake on the left oops a fucking snake just bit me 
none	 i take one  point damage and i make a constitution save versus ten  ashly it literally says a fucking snake by the way  mary constitution which okay ten  sam that saves youre fine just one point of damage  mary goddamn it and i step on the fucking snake  sam its dead would you like the thing on the right  mary yes another fucking snake whoa i will take that  sam okay do you proceed into this room or do you hang out  mary i turn around and i say kittykitty there 
none	 seems to be another room down here and it seems to  me that the frost is dissipating a bit on the floor what do you think we should do theres no  sign of footprints but i dont know that there were footprints on the other way jayne do you  see footprints besides your own of course  liam im looking at the door in front of me and seeing if i can see anything hinky with it  sam sure make an investigation check  liam natural 20  sam the door is not locked and not 
dung	 trapped  liam well im going to go inside  sam youre so freaky its a rather long room with boxes everywhere seems to be some sort of  storage area in the middle is a table with potions and beakers on it a closet over here it  is not lit at all lets see what i said about it a single lantern glows near the door casting dark  shadows everywhere stacked boxes all around weirdly the smell of cabbage permeates the air  in the center of the room a wooden table resembling a crude chemistry lab 
none	 beakers and  vials are arranged a whiff of something strange hits you it stings your nose like gasoline would  you like to look around  liam i would first like to cast light again because its a cantrip i can do it as many times  as i want and that means the bards ass goes out and ill say that the grip of my whip lights up  and i hold it upside down  sam thats so cool so youve got a white whip thats lit up  mary so its finally useful is it  
none	 liam youre not there  mary that was zahra showing up for a moment  liam you said there were potions on the table that i see now  sam you can investigate that yeah  ashly is it possible for me at some point to try to grapple her  sam to grapple jayne if you want to walk down the hall you can try  liam ive entered the room and i want to inspect the potions you said there were on the table  sam okay roll an investigation check  ashly can i move toward the 
none	 room  sam sure  ashly and try to grapple jayne  liam ten  sam okay ten is what you needed upon further inspection you use your light to reveal the  labels on the jugs someone has been mixing liquor down here after a minute of study you figure out  that the house alcohol greep is made right here and the formula is remarkably basic it is four  parts standard rice wine one part balsamic vinegar one part simple syrup and one part pure  kerosene everyone who has drank it has been drinking kerosene the 
none	 whole night  liam i jot that down on a scrap of paper and put it away because i am a businesswoman as well  sam thats it thats all you find currently  liam okay i will start back and find the catwoman in the doorway  sam okay catwoman what would you like to do  ashly hi jayne and i would like to grapple her by the neck and hold her aloft  mary oh hi jayne  sam hows sanctuary going still on  liam its up to you if ten minutes have passed since i 
none	 cast it  sam it has not been ten minutes so youll have to make a wisdom saving throw against 14  ashly shit well shes not very smart so she would try natural 20  liam thats the third one for burch  sam so sadly that does not mean that you grapple that means that you have the fortitude to  attempt to grapple  ashly itd be really sad if it fails right now i got a nine is there anything i could apply to it  sam yeah strength and youre pretty strong  ashly so 
none	 its 12  sam wait three your strength is three no its not  ashly plus three modifier  sam really i thought you were stronger than that  ashly wait or is it this one saving throw  sam no youre right  liam and i have to roll versus it so you got a what total  sam 12  liam thats a big four  laughter  brian im still so used to liam rolling and then going 196  liam the big thing tonight is im like luck no phantom limb syndrome  sam okay so 
none	 you are grappled and restrained you both cant move or anything unless you want to  try to drag her somewhere  ashly i want to be like what the fuck man you brought me here im doing you a favor why did  you try to fucking kill me  liam strained it was probably a bad idea  ashly bad idea yeah so how are you going to make it up to me  liam strained i think you need to kill me later i think we need to survive this basement  ashly i dont give a 
none	 fuck about this girl or anything going on with you so if you dont want  to die right now or have me leave and fucking feed you to these dogs  liam were talking a long time can i cast a spell  sam sure yeah  liam i would like to cast inflict wounds at second level make a melee spell attack against a  creature you reach okay shes done that is a 19 plus six that is a 25  sam what does this spell do  liam this is inflict wounds make a melee spell 
none	 attack against a creature you can reach on a hit  the target takes 3d10 necrotic damage except im doing it at second level so its 4d10 and so my  hand just grips her forearm and death filters through it ten 19 29  ashly and mary singing i have three hit points just three hit points i am about to die  sam that was beautiful and sad  liam not even the bard  ashly you know what  sam all right so you are released jayne from her grapple  ashly whatever you want to do 
none	 is fine that was fine everything is fine what do you need buddy  brian can i do something since were all in the same area am i standing next to frankfurt  eric ah jesus its freezing down here  ashly i have two hit points left im bad at math i have two hit points left so am i knocked out  liam no youre awake you motherfucker  sam you are feeling really shitty right now  brian wait did she do the 1d6 to her attack for the bardic inspiration that i gave you  mary 
none	 she hasnt used it yet  liam thats water under the bridge brain  brian fuck the bridge  mary use it next time for something  brian okay can i force myself to throw up greep onto him it says i have a candle can i then  light that candle and light frankfurt on fire because i threw greep up on to him  sam i mean you can certainly make an attempt  mary thats 3000 actions  liam gagging your ass and then lighting a candle seems like possibly three actions  brian have you ever 
tavern	 had someone with a gnome bardsized penis steal your wife from you  sam so many times go ahead and make a constitution saving throw to see if you can make  yourself throw up  liam dnd is all about negotiation  brian constitution saving were going to go with a 12 or no 11  sam you stick your fingers down your throat to throw up but it doesnt work you gag and dry  heave for a while and nothing comes up unfortunately  brian so a typical night at the tavern  mary all right you 
none	 two would you stop it for the moment seriously we have a mission here or  at least you and i have a mission and i do not want to look kingston i love your work i  really do and i realize that youre a fantastic writer and everything else but there are other  things to do right now there is a room underneath the stairs shall we check it out it gets  increasingly warmer it seems  brian are the elderly whores in there  mary yes they most certainly are  brian lets go  
none	 mary whispering frankfurt come with me and well get to her yes  sam whos going down there you three  eric yeah  mary the others split up and go rogue whoa  sam as you walk in you see that the walls of this part of the tunnel are rough as if they had  been clawed out of the rocks its very cold you can see your breath as you enter its also pitch  black because light is gone those of you with darkvision can faintly see that this tunnel im  going to skip that 
none	 part in the interest of time that this tunnel continues into darkness for a  wide oval anteroom its a bit oddly shaped to be a storage room its about 20 feet wide with a 15  foot coved ceiling  brian my ass is an hour  sam when he cast light it went out  mary oh can i cast light  sam sure if you would like to okay things look nice and bright in here four evenly spaced  pillars are holding up the ceiling each with intricate beautiful carvings at the other side  of 
none	 the room is a single large door the door seems to be made of heavy forged iron with carefully  inlaid bronze details images of fire and lizard tongues who would like to do anything or walk  around or enter what do you want to do  liam while theyre thinking about it can i talk to the cat  sam sure go ahead  liam im not a very nice person  ashly strained im gathering that  liam yes i am a servant of the chained oblivion and i want everything destroyed and i know that  
none	 doesnt sync up with your motivation thats rough but i could kill you now  ashly sure yeah  liam or you could come with me and help me get this girl and then maybe youll make your way out  of it maybe youll survive im going to give you a chance because i think youre worth more to me  alive now than dead and if youre very nice and dont argue ill even make you feel a little  better what do you say  ashly that sounds great its cool im good were good yeah  
none	 liam clothesline im not a nice person  ashly i get it i got it from the time when you almost killed me yeah i got it im good  liam i facepalm her and cast cure wounds that is ill tell you that is eight hit points back  for you hooray eight hey  ashly hey ugh coughs i would say thanks but im not going to argue what do you need  liam you can try to kill me later i want the little redhaired girl you understand  ashly yeah redhaired girl got it got it

none	 what was your check mary  mary 18 and i speak elvish abysmal and common  sam abyssal youre looking at the floor specifically okay brian can you roll an  investigation check okay so mary looking on the floor you do not see any tiles or anything it is  smooth like poured cement seemingly no traps on the floor glancing about the room  though as you step in and sort of use your light to look around you rolled an 18 you said you  see cobwebs and grime and dust all over the place its not 
none	 a very used room but on the ceiling you  do notice faint symbols covered in years of cobwebs and grime brian what did you roll  brian was it an investigation 18  sam okay so you cannot read any writing on these youre investigating the pillars you  cant read any writing on them but its okay because theres not really any  brian do i recognize the symbols  sam there are symbols of serpents carved up and down on these pillars way nicer than they need to  be and you can see from your excellent 
none	 investigation skill that the eyes of the serpents  have a faint glow of magic in them they are definitely trapped  brian we got some weird snake shit going on over here guys i dont want to touch it but i would  like it if one of you did  mary i was bitten by a snake on the way in so i would recommend not touching any of the snakes  brian maybe youre immune now that it bit you and you could just go touch it and press one of the  eyes and maybe it 
none	 wont do anything to you i recommend trying all the eyes  mary it would make such a good story though in your book if you did it kingston  brian oh i know but if it goes bad who will be around to write the book surely a fan such as  yourself would be dedicated enough to  mary did you always write your books or did you have a ghostwriter  brian oh i didnt have a ghostwriter are you kidding me the pain that i went through i was  able to pull from so many 
none	 different places  ashly could i also do a perception check do i see the symbols on the ceiling  sam not yet not until you roll  ashly that is a 19  sam you definitely see the symbols on the ceiling theyre all over the place many of them  they appear to be writing in common they appear to be numbers lots and lots of numbers also  glancing about the room youve entered now behind this pillar back here you find something heads or tails  ashly oh tails because im a cat  sam here 
tavern	 you go all right so that is something you find  mary how high is the ceiling  sam the ceiling is whatever i said before 25 foot coved ceiling 25 feet high and its covered  with numbers theyre all hard to make out because its dusty  mary numbers huh i have a feeling were going to have to touch one of those  ashly is anyone good with numbers im not great with numbers  brian and im drunk  sam okay from the other side of the door you hear a girl scream  mary at 
none	 the end  sam yes  mary oh balls all right  brian that end oh shit  ashly hey creepy girl are you good with numbers  liam no but i have other skills i would like to cast command on the dwarf he has to make a wisdom  saving throw so roll the d20 plus three  eric are you allowed to do this is he allowed to do this  sam sure he can do whatever he wants you can also hit him over the head if you want  liam not until after this spell

none	 check a retroactive perception  check to see if you could hear that  eric a straight roll  liam roll high catch me out because im terrible thats a two  eric two fuck  sam you heard him say jaynes a mailman  eric got to clean my ears  sam but something about jayne has been bugging you a lot me too really if were going to be  honest  eric ive got my eye on you jayne  sam so is this where you guys are standing where are you  mary yep thats where 
none	 you put us  brian i might be leaning against something because im a little tipsy  mary i would like to move towards the door  brian yeah ill go with her  ashly so there is a door there  sam thats a door  brian then theres a girl screaming on the other side of that door  liam jayne places her hand on clotheslines shoulder and says wait no i didnt leave that  hallway whenever she would have walked forward i would have said wait  sam oh so shes back here but she found 
none	 an object over there so shes definitely there  liam its up to you if you wanted to  ashly i will do what you say  sam you can tell her to go back or you can tell her to wait there but shes already there  liam come  sam come where  liam no im at that tunnel entrance i never entered  sam okay got it so youre calling her back great and frankie  eric im going to stay right there  sam great so you take four points of poison damage as this pillar 
none	 shoots out a bit of poison  youre standing near it unfortunately  eric look i just want to be close to the action  sam cool you guys kind of get the sense that the longer you stay in here the more shits going to  start happening anyone want to look at the door  mary i would like to look at the door  sam okay make an investigation check  mary oh tides of chaos thats better not really 18 16  sam great the door is not trapped however it has a lock on it 
none	 a padlock a curiously made  padlock where is it  mary are there numbers on the padlock  sam there are numbers on the padlock and you can definitely sense that the padlock is magically  enchanted and here it is  liam oh shit  mary what are the numbers on the padlock  sam who wants to look where  liam im looking at the ceiling  sam okay youre looking at the ceiling  liam you said there are a lot of numbers up there  sam tons of numbers 29 seven 65 44 ten nine 
none	 four  liam and theres nothing different about any of them  sam yes there are they are all in different colors some are red some are green some are  yellow some are gold some are orange  mary can you see if there are numbers like four numbers on the ceiling that are the same color  liam what color is the lock  sam the lock is a basic gray however the slot where you line up the correct numbers has a faint  color on it the first two are orange the second two are green 
none	  mary okay so im looking at the padlock because youre up at the ceiling and im at the door  right two orange two green what do you see up top  liam an irish flag  mary all right which numbers are orange which numbers are green up on the ceiling  sam can you make a perception check its really grimy up there  liam that is a 17 for me  sam you definitely get a bead on the orange numbers grab your pencil theres many orange  numbers theyre all across the top of the 
none	 ceiling they are six one eight seven two  one eight two four nine two seven one zero  liam youre a terrible person  ashly can i use this item about this  sam what is this item is it the earring it can tell you something about a person or a creature  but not about a room  ashly okay  liam were those the orange numbers  sam those were the orange numbers  mary what are the green numbers  sam make another perception check  liam i got a 14  sam you can 
none	 make out many of them you get the sense that if you got closer somehow you could  see more  liam hows the bard doing  sam the bard  liam the bard  sam i dont know how hes doing  liam i see him staring up as well how are you doing darling  brian fine im wondering the endgame i might go back upstairs but i want to see  liam can you read the numbers on the ceiling  brian yeah let me try oh wait i did oh perception i did investigation  ashly 
none	 i rolled a 16 for perception  sam okay so fine while kingston is fiddling with his wingle  brian 20  sam 20 you both see the green numbers very clearly through the grime dust and cobwebs are  one five four nine eight one four one three two zero  liam keep going  sam now i wait  laughter  mary there are three less green numbers than there are orange and weve got two and two on the  padlock two orange and two green first two numbers add to six and six motherfucker i was 
none	  promised no math  brian promised no math  ashly theres four pillars in the room but i assume its not relevant  mary theres only three right is the one pillar still standing or did it explode after hitting us  liam theres four pillars one of them poofed out poison  eric it was rough  sam sorry guys on the other side of the door you hear a low snarling  mary oh fuck all right  brian did that sound like a cat to anyone else  mary no that sounded like a lizard or 
none	 something  liam and the lock looks like what over there  mary its like a big padlock  brian is there anything i can see on the lock tell me about the lock  sam sure make an investigation check  brian 18  sam 18 thats great yeah it is specifically designed in a way that its a fragile thing i  wouldnt try to hit it because it has a trigger mechanism that could fire something if struck  its got a pressure pad on it  ashly thats what i was going to do  mary 
none	 can we see any of the numbers on the walls is there anything else on the walls  sam no numbers on the walls  mary theres nothing on the floor  ashly how many snakes are on the pillars  sam let me do the math  brian theres no numbers on the pillars correct just symbols  liam sams given us a mensa challenge and we all die here  mary we come back four years later all right so the numbers again six one eight  liam seven months without an episode break  sam on one 
none	 pillar theres one snake on the next theres three on the next theres two on  the next theres six  eric say that again  sam one three two six  brian thats on the pillars both or all four  sam this one has one this one has three this one has two this one has six  brian does the padlock have four numbers to open it  sam four numbers two orange two green  brian how do we try them  liam the numbers on the pillars are not any color are they  sam 
none	 no  ashly i wonder if theres a penalty for trying them you could try it on this if you want to  brian could i try it on this okay im just going to fucking just because i know this fucker  this is very hard to turn it needs some wd40 sam  sam sorry  brian its okay  liam youre so brave kingston you should try as many combinations as possible even if it burns  you somehow you should keep trying  brian is it top to bottom or bottom to top to open this 
none	  sam top to bottom  brian shit fuck someone do something else while i do this  ashly while hes doing that sam im going to use this earring of piercing knowledge and try to  find out if there are any weaknesses that jayne has  sam she gets to know one fact about you what she has just used is a magical what is it called  ashly earring of piercing knowledge  sam you have to pierce your ear with it little trickle of blood comes down and now she knows one  fact about you 
none	 and shes chosen to know your weaknesses  liam my weaknesses i dont know what those are i could tell her many things  sam well how about your lets see here  liam i will tell you lots of things in the interest of not slowing down this episode you  learn that im very weak and easily hit you learn that i am almost out of spells and you have  learned that i am part of four generations of women that have served the chained oblivion which  is a god that everyone has heard of and 
none	 the chained oblivion wants to destroy everything and i  am fucking crazy just like my mother  sam make a perception check or investigation check whatevers higher  mary investigation 14  sam upon looking at the numbers up top especially the orange ones you start to realize  theres spaces between them its six 18 seven 21 eight 24 nine 27 ten there are spaces in  between  mary those are the orange numbers  sam come on guys its basic arithmetic  ashly we all had a little bit of greep i cant even remember what 
none	 its called now  mary and ashly greep  liam whats after the eight 24  sam 24  liam nine the fuck is this sam  ashly im sure the chats like its this its this  sam oh they are absolutely  mary the chats going why cant you figure it out  brian are we in any imminent danger  sam as you say that one of the pillars explodes these guys mary and brian you each take five  points of poison damage  liam i see a pattern but i dont know what it leads 
none	 to  ashly 24 nine  liam assholes  ashly what  liam six is onethird of 18 seven is onethird of 21 eight is onethird of 24 nine is onethird  of 27 ten whats the ten ten is different than the rest i dont know if that means ten is  important but its different than the rest ten  sam say that all again liam  liam six is onethird of 18 seven is onethird of 21 eight is onethird of 24 nine is onethird  of 27 ten is onethird of theres nothing there  brian 
none	 what is ten onethird of  liam 30  brian so try well theres four numbers though  sam those numbers that youre looking at are orange the first two slots on the lock are  orange  brian so we need to find the two numbers that are green now  sam make a perception check  brian groans this isnt going well for me  mary thats a five  brain perception 18  sam there are also spaces between these numbers  brian nope 13 your writings too small  sam one  brian is that an 
none	 eight or a three  liam why did you have to bring math into it you shit  sam yeah i know right four i cant really write upside down  liam youre doing it  mary and sam nine eight  mary 14  sam correct 14  mary and sam 13 20  liam shit what is that  brian well theres even and odd numbers mixed up in there  mary one plus four is five four plus five is nine eight plus six is 14 13 plus seven is 20  thats all i know thats
