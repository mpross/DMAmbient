none	 of  critical role as the party has been split due to a circumstance where in the city of vasselheim  the party chasing after a hydra that seemed to be harrying the outside walls of the city and  slaying it got in the way and accidentally broke the laws of the vasselheim by hunting and slaying  when they werent approved to do so being called skags by a band of hunters that works for the  slayers take guildhall a guild that pretty much regulates most hunting of monsters and creatures  within the vicinity of vasselheim 
none	 so as opposed to going up and dealing with charges at the seat  of justice they instead were given the option by the head of the guild hall to possibly join but in  order to do so they would have to fulfill a contract and prove themselves worthy of being a  member of the guild and the guild master our fantastic huntmaster vanessa cyndrial handpicked  two different groups splitting up the twins and they have all set out to return the next day to  join and figure out what their contract will be so this 
none	 week we have playing we have grog we  have vexahlia we have percy we have the  shortly arriving here scanlan  who has been fighting la traffic  travis hes here  cheering  matt quite literally shortly arriving scanlan  travis like superman that was amazing  matt and eventually to join the party as they slowly make their way there mysterious head  kiss this is the best thursday ever we have joining us eventually at some point we have the  very wonderful and talented mary elizabeth mcglynn a fantastic talented voice actress and  
none	 director and amazing person  mary hello sorry  matt so look her stuff up online she is also a great musician singer and this is her first time  playing dungeons and dragons  travis newbie  mary newbie  matt yeah im super excited  travis im going to kill you  mary yes  matt probably and in the middle of the other table we have our other illustrious guest this  evening the socalled headmaster of geek and sundry herself felicia day  thank you for joining us felicia  cheering  felicia i like to 
none	 refer to myself as duchess grand duchess  matt grand duchess also viable  sam golf claps  felicia golf claps very appropriate  matt laughs so yeah thank you so much for joining  felicia im so excited to be here im a huge fan of the show so i spend my  thursdays watching you guys  sam who is your favorite character on the show  laura say trinket say trinket  felicia not the one with the scatological problem  sam i think of it more as a gift  laughter  taliesin that keeps giving 
none	 and giving and  mary the one who likes to talk to poo  travis well thats a lot of us actually  matt before we get into the nitty gritty do we have any announcements we want to make anything  in particular coming up i believe laura youre bolting at the end of the game  laura im leaving probably during the game to catch my flight to go to gencon for the  titansgrave panel tomorrow  matt yeah which for the record i want to point out guys this is how much laura loves you she 
none	  was going to miss todays game but then bit the bullet changed her flight just so she could be  here to play with everyone  felicia golf claps  laura well after i saw my glorious trinket yesterday there was no choice really  matt laughs the trinket that devours by the way every person thats hugged that bear has  vanished temporarily within its physical form it is a new wonderful addition to the chat room  i mean to the whole show and thank you to the critters for making that happen its ridiculous  its 
none	 you guys are the best i have no words anything else anyone wants to announce  anything coming up  mary im off to san antonio tomorrow morning very early for san japan with steve blum so  come on out and have some fun in san antonio  matt heck yeah its a great convention i went there last year theyre really really good so  all you folks out there  mary we were both there last year  matt thats right we were  mary yes  matt so go check out mary in san antonio you 
none	 guys should go also weve had a lot of questions  through twitter from a lot of the fans and i like the idea of transparency and mentioning how  first off no game or game master is infallible and rules do shift and change and there have been  a couple of minor alterations to the rules which you know you house rule things in a game and you  test it out and balance can shift for those who have looked at the gunslinger martial archetype  that percy plays with i have made a few adjustments to 
none	 it balancing out a few elements  there dcs for different shots and  taliesin definitely some foam darts that im shooting now thats all im saying im saying  there is a lot of pump action and then a foam dart comes out  travis really  taliesin with a suction thing at the end  matt you dont get foam darts until level 18 that is a higher level ability the noise happens  at level 19 you level up to get the actual sound so check out the gunslinger archetype  theres been some changes to it 
none	 also for the sorcerer points we had house ruled a  configuration where sorcerer points would be one point per spell level of spell cast as the levels  got higher it got a little overpowered in some combat circumstances so we narrowed that down  which is still a bonus over the actual rules which allow you to only cast one spell per round and a  cantrip we made it so that you can cast with quickened spell any spell and then a 2ndlevel  spell maximum in the same round slight variation  laura i dont understand 
none	 anything you just said  taliesin made no sense to me  mary two spells at once two spells  matt thats okay its for the sorcerer you dont have to worry about it minor house rule  adjustments so all you guys out there who gm and dm dont be afraid to adjust balance as you go as  long as you talk to the players about it anyway thats it and thats all on my end shall we  go ahead and begin  travis loud maniacal laughter  matt calm down phillip  travis all right but 
none	 im not phillip right now he lost im a winner  laura phillip doesnt exist anymore  travis cries  laura phillips legacy is 1000 gold to repay  travis phillip is training to an 80s training montage right now in a beef locker somewhere  mary because everyone needs a montage  travis yep  matt glorious i think that is an important circumstance all right so getting this started  the party has found themselves in the city of vasselheim a very deity and religion based city  in a very harsh environment its far up north in 
dung	 this continent and the weather itself is  very cold the landscape is very harsh and rugged and outside of the city itself there is an  extremely dark oppressive almost unnaturally fastgrowing forest known as the vesper  timberland this is where you encountered the hydra last time you just barely trekked out of the  the city and found that creature who knows what else lies out there but the city seems very well  prepared to defend itself against whatever atrocities make their way towards the outskirts of  the city so after grog fought very gloriously 
tavern	 in the crucible and just barely lost due to a test of  strength that just didnt fall in his favor he sulked via ale and ladies back at the tavern  travis yeah  matt now after defeating the hydra being called on their law breakage in vasselheim have been  tasked to return the next morning as separate groups to figure out what contract is being given  to them and what members of their team await them as they arrive so you guys have taken the  evening to rest the next morning has come about you 
tavern	 find yourselves awakening within your  respective tavern rooms the members of vox machina what preparation would you like to embark  in this morning for whatever mysterious trek awaits you  travis do they have a weapons closet  laura in the tavern room  travis oh shit i thought we were in the guildhall  matt not yet you can go there if you want to but if there is anything you want to do before  arriving at the guildhall thats up to you  travis scanlan  sam oi  travis do you want anything from 
tavern	 the tavern before we leave  sam what time is it  travis what time is it  laura what difference does it make i want to take a shot with my brother  matt all right so as you and vaxildan get together at the bar you have the strongest form  of nasty vasselheim liquor that they could possibly muster it looks somewhat murky it has  elements of blue and gray to it the barkeep assured you that this is this is what youre  looking for to wake up in the morning trust me  laura 
none	 does it taste like nyquil  matt as you down the shot its not knowing what nyquil tastes like because there is no such  thing as nyquil in this world  laura right  taliesin ye olde nyquil  matt the flavor would be reminiscent of licking a wagon wheel that has seen  at least 100 miles of travel  laura tastes like your feet smell brother  matt of which vax immediately cringes his face oh well that is rather uncouth dear sister  taliesin and not having liam here ill just like that  travis get 
tavern	 rid of it put it down  matt the foots healed now the foot is healed so you finish your shots  you say adieu to each other and  laura see you on the other side  matt indeed stay safe  travis bye vax laughs  matt bye grog and he gives you a silent finger as he leaves the tavern in true vax fashion  travis he always mixes those fingers up  matt any preparation on your guys end  sam im going to load up my whatever this thing is  matt your ioun stone 
none	  sam is that what i have thats the thing here im going to load that up with an invisibility  spell is that a thing i could do  matt yeah you can put up to three spell levels into that  sam thats two in there right  matt you may have even been able to do before you slept the night before so then you would  have all your spells back so well say you did that  so you have an extra invisibility  spell in your ioun stone  sam and i can store 
none	 three spells in there right  matt three spell levels  sam three spell level so only one spell at a time  matt or you can do three 1stlevel spells  sam oh then never mind i thought it was three different spells ive already got an extra  lightning bolt in there i wont add to it never mind  matt then yeah that is a full ioun stone that thing is pulsing with energy and going  im good  sam im good didnt understand  matt fair enough percy  taliesin other than just tinkering on 
none	 a few plans that i have rolling around i dont really have  the equipment to build anything particularly interesting before we head out  sam grog might have something in the bag of holding that you could use  travis oh yeah ive got lots of shit we have a salt lick rock weve got three firewood bundles  dried food rations  sam how many fancy cloaks left  travis theres two  sam well thats something  taliesin and weve got that leather from that weird bat creature from the underdark  travis yeah im sure it 
dung	 doesnt smell bad  laura oh yeah  taliesin is there any metal canisters in there of any kind  travis i mean ive got my hooded lantern but you cant have that its dark in places  taliesin no i dont want that  laura i bet tiberius has metal canisters hes got so many canisters  travis two pieces of armor just armor  taliesin i may take a piece of armor and see if i can put together some sort of frag grenade thing  sam a what  taliesin i just want to make a  
none	 sam is that a thing  taliesin you dont know me  laughter  taliesin just make a canister put some black powder in there put the thing together it  doesnt even have a fuse its something i can toss and shoot to trigger  travis ooh  matt interesting i will say due to time constraints you would probably have to skip a  decent breakfast to do this so be aware you may be hungry later on  laura ive got food  taliesin done  travis weve got dried food rations in the bag  taliesin 
tavern	 ill have a granola bar  matt go ahead and make an investigation check  travis roll good youre starting us off roll good  sam im going to try to inspire him  travis roll good  taliesin youre going to inspire me  sam im going to inspire him with a little sings boom clap the sound of your gun the  beat goes on and on and on and on boom clap thats all i got  matt you can take your d10 bardic inspiration as his song blares into your left ear as you search  
town	 the town for a decent location to possibly construct this  taliesin 19  matt total of 19  taliesin total of 19  matt all right asking around and speaking to a few folks around vasselheim you eventually find a  few folks that point you toward this long abandoned workshop thats been burned down and it  hasnt really been touched as you go to it you have to push some of the burned wood out of the  way but there is indeed a currently functional if for a long time unused forge and anvil  available 
none	 in poor condition but functional given about two two and a half hours  you might be pushing your arrival time at the guildhall but you could probably do it do you  want to go ahead and give it a shot  taliesin im going to give it a shot  matt all right do you want to use another one of your bardic inspirations on this  sam can i do that  matt you can use it up to i think its like five or six times  sam hes fine  laughter  travis stingy motherfucker 
tavern	  sam at this point im probably drunk  taliesin i dont get a montage then never mind its all right save it for later were  going to need it for later  matt so it takes you a while to rummage through the ground to get everything set up you have the  tools from your tinkers kit that you usually keep with you anyway and you begin hammering away at  the metal preparing yourself a nice little spherical container using your black powder  which youre starting to get a little low on black powder between 
none	 your bullets youve been  constructing and other stuff  taliesin got to get home i know  matt so something you can either some point in the future try to scavenge up the materials for or  make yourself but just letting you know youre starting to run a little low so go ahead and make  a im going to say make a tinkering check with your proficiency bonus of four and we will say  with your dexterity since this is very meticulous to make sure this doesnt detonate  during construction  sam wow you could 
none	 really use some inspiration right now  taliesin no i dont that is a 29  sam stingy works  travis like twonine  taliesin like twonine not two nines but twonine  matt what did you roll  taliesin i rolled 19  matt yeah thatll do it  laughter  matt all right so in spite of the terrible materials at your disposal as far as the forge  itself you barely get it lit but you can manage to heat it at enough at least to ply a soft  metal there is an aluminum base type 
none	 that you construct as the container and then coat that  with chunks of very very hard steel that you think will work as shrapnel you manage to  complete it youre not sure how effective it will be but at least you know it will travel safe and  that is really more important than anything else with these type of makeshift explosives  taliesin i made a holy hand grenade  laughter  travis awesome  matt indeed all right as the rest of you gather up youve had your breakfast you rested you  make your way 
none	 towards the slayers take guildhall approaching the front steps again the wooden  engraving on the front doors you step into the main foyer area and are greeted again by mertin  the gruff looking halfling who is in the process of thumbing through some books he has some dried  fruit on the side of his chin hes a little groggy like he  didnt sleep well the night before  travis hes a little what  matt hes a little groggy  travis lucky chap  matt he looks up as you guys approach very nice you all 
none	 could finally make it it appears you are  only a grand total of 25 minutes late  laura 25  matt its not too much of a problem  sam whats a minute  matt its all right there is not too much going on at the moment i will not mention this to  the wife i mean the huntmaster dont mention to her that i referred to her as my wife  travis kords strength to you sir youve got a little bit right here  laura oh thats lovely  matt i appreciate the heads up 
none	  travis not a problem not a problem  matt i hate to lose papaya so lets see we have the four of you here this is the required  necessary group for the first travel this morning i am excited to see what the mistress has  available for you first and foremost let me introduce to you one of your traveling companions  for this another hopeful for the slayers take let me retrieve her  and you see mertin walks off to one of the back rooms opens the door and whispers out hey  quick your 
none	 team is here opens the door and walking out if you want to describe yourself  mary i walk out in a black cloak  sam this is exciting  mary my hair is white and i have silver eyes and a long staff with four dragons and a moonstone  planet as it were in their midst i walk out slowly and i look them all over one by one  saying i dont know you i dont know you as my tail whips back and forth i dont know you  almost hitting you with my horns you 
none	 i know i saw you at the crucible didnt i  travis maybe  mary well done against the hammer  travis thank you i often get confused with phillip the terrible  mary yes ill bet you do you dont look that terrible to me though  travis grog begins to blush a large blue color on his cheeks  laura whats your name woman  mary zahra  sam what  mary zahra zahra hydris  laura lovely  mary and whats yours  sam me  mary yes  sam well im known by different names in 
none	 different places  travis aint that the truth  mary really  sam some call me kingslayer  laughter  sam some call me scanlan some just call me when they want a good time  laughter  taliesin mostly we just call him scanlan  mary ill keep the good time in mind and you  taliesin percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii  travis you can call him percy  taliesin they just call me percy  mary i see you have many weapons on you  taliesin yes i dabble  mary you dabble a 
none	 bit  taliesin i do dabble  mary yes any forging  taliesin yes actually i just picked it up recently ive been working on things i pull out  the holy hand grenade  mary ah  taliesin getting better  mary i saw one of those in antioch once  taliesin its where ive seen them written of its something new  mary well have to compare notes sometime  taliesin absolutely charmed  mary id love to see your technique  matt there is something mildly offputting by her intense red skin her relatively pointed incisors  
dung	 and the very prominent tiefling demonic blood in her body  travis youre a tiefling  matt nevertheless there is an elegance to the way she walks and there is this look of silent  judgment as she continuously passes her eyes over the rest of the group  laura did you want to know my name  mary yes i would now im not so sure but please humor me  laura vexahlia its a pleasure  mary the pleasure is all mine  laura yes  travis oh thats an icy hand grip isnt it  laura i 
none	 love being out here without my brother i just love it  mary you have a brother  laura i do  mary oh how fascinating  travis i am grog the unintimidated  mary its nice to know your true name phillip i mean grog  travis whispered i think she knows  taliesin i would like to run a quick perception test  matt what are you trying to do  taliesin im trying to figure out if shes titled she certainly strikes me as titled i  think she has blood she may not have blue blood 
none	 but  laura whispers shes got blood  matt this would be more of an insight check  taliesin insight check all right  travis whispers shes a tiefling  taliesin ten  matt best you can tell from her posture the way she walks there is definitely a for lack of a  better term a nonarrogant self importance to how she holds herself but there is something about it  that there is a mild hint of insecurity there  taliesin interesting all right  travis could i ask you what your weapon of choice is  mary 
none	 that would be my staff  travis oh right yeah  mary it took many years to forge it  laura you made it yourself  mary i did  laura damn thats impressive  mary thank you  matt at this point mertin is looking angrily at a small pocket watch that he pulls out and looks at  this is very unusual let me see who is supposed to be leading your group hold on just a moment  and he gets up and exits the room briefly  laura leading  matt he comes back after about 
none	 two minutes with a small handbook and reads through yes well it is  customary that as a part of these trials there is a member of the slayers take is to accompany you  on this journey to make sure that you  sam i volunteer to be leader of the group  matt that is not up for discussion i am sorry small man  laughter  sam i magically make a cup appear  matt he looks slightly impressed but only slightly by the way being called small man by a  halfling is a feat within 
none	 itself all right so the assigned leader to be your guide slayer for  this venture oh really well this should be curious indeed shes late it seems at which  point the door opens to the guild hall and in comes stumbling a human female  felicia and i run and i oh my gosh im so sorry im late im so sorry and then i trip  ridiculously and i spill cut papaya everywhere oh my gosh that is disappointing that is just  disappointing oh my gosh you are so impressive how lovely mertin i brought you 
none	 some  papaya im sorry its all over the floor right now i you know what i will go get a broom ill  clean it up right now  matt no no dont worry about it i insist  felicia somebody might slip  matt stay with your group we have important business to discuss i appreciate the papaya  travis under his breath shes the leader  felicia well i just wanted to this is my group yay  desultory yays  felicia so nice to meet all of you you are large you are not you are 
none	 so pretty  laura oh you are too  felicia oh my gosh ive heard about her she is something  laura she is yeah  felicia anyway nice to meet you nice to meet you  all hi  felicia hi im lyra  all lyra lyra  felicia yes very nice to meet you all  matt and you can see from her she is dressed in a nice blouse her justpastshoulderlength  somewhat curly hair is kept as much as a frazzled woman would keep a large pair of glasses adorn  the front of her face 
none	 and she definitely is not who you were expecting to be considered leading  this group into its journey  travis nope  mary no  laura what sort of fighter are you lyra  felicia oh this is so exciting this is im getting out mertin they are letting me out this  is so exciting  matt this is probably a technicality ill have to make sure this was maybe not  taliesin please yes  felicia oh no i dont think so  mary do you find yourself sitting behind a wooden structure most of the day 
none	 something flat like  this like a desk or a table  felicia oh my gosh do you have psy abilities  mary just intuition i guess  felicia oh no this is so funny ive seen you from afar but im very busy in the back room you  know im very im invaluable right mertin  matt she is useful yes  felicia yes im very good at alphabetizing listen we are going to catch up so much im just  really excited they are letting me out mertin  sam have you led a group like this 
none	 before  felicia no its so funny you wouldnt be able to tell right  travis and laura not at all  mary you seem very experienced  travis veteran  laura very incharge  felicia thank you thank you i mean listen i just wanted to welcome everybody no no they  dont actually let me out a lot and i was you know when i got the scroll in front  it was  just this is my best robe  mary youve got a little papaya juice on the front of it  felicia oh no oh 
none	 no oh no and then im like brushing it and accidentally the robe falls off  gasp oh my god that was inadvertent  matt you hear this awkward smack sound as mertin has facepalmed as unbelievably hard as he can  at the edge of his desk i shall retrieve the huntmaster then he gets up and leaves you guys  are left alone in the foyer for a moment  sam so lyra you are already a full fledged slayer  felicia i am in fact  sam have you slain  felicia i am a member of 
none	 the guild well if you want to be technical  sam you seem like someone from the guild  felicia yes im a guild member its funny because its kind of a technicality i dont know  how that happened but im here  laura what do you normally do bookkeeping storage  felicia oh well its a really long story can i tell you all about it  sam abridged abridged  laura grog look papaya  travis rah  felicia i guess some of its still clean  sam he doesnt care  travis its still good  
none	 felicia yes so  laura and trinket trinket too this is my bear  sam oh do we get trinket  laura yes of course we get trinket  scanlan do we get trinket on the trip  matt as you turn you see that the door after you pass and the giant armored bear has made its way  in and pushes past your shoulder abruptly and immediately goes nose down and joins grog eating  papaya off of the ground  travis hey get your own papaya  laura this is trinket  mary fascinating what kind of 
none	 bear is he  taliesin a big one  laura a brown one  travis we start to wrestle gently thats my papaya you let go  felicia does anyone have any allergies if i take some togo lunches  laura oh that would be lovely actually  travis cats  laura actually i think percy is quite hungry  taliesin i actually am quite hungry i was i dont know if i am quite capable of eating papaya  off the floor but if there is i dont know something brunchy  travis i have some dried food rations 
none	 would you want one of those  taliesin it will do in a pinch  felicia here is a crumbled biscuit  taliesin a crumbled biscuit sounds i like her already that will do  travis i will remember this slight  sam so have you slain have you had any battle experience at all  felicia well its funny im actually from this city but i was in emon and i was studying im a  wizard you know the wizardly arts  sam oh ive heard of them yes  felicia yes absolutely  sam i dabble with 
none	 them myself  felicia exactly my uncle is actually the diplomat from emon here in vasselheim  sam oh we are from emon as well  felicia thats so funny  laura perhaps youve heard of us  sam vox machina  laura castle greyskull keep  sam castle greyskull some know us as the shits  taliesin kind of a big deal  felicia no no but i would love to hear all about it ill put it on a scroll anyway so i  came here because my boyfriend aldor is here he is going to be my 
none	 boyfriend its a long story  sam weve met aldor  laura we have  sam we have  laura where did we meet aldor  sam yes we met aldor  matt he was the leader of the team that found you guys in the forest  travis thats right  laura gasps that guy  sam we tangled with him our first run in with aldor was not fortuitous  felicia did he look good did he look healthy  laura i mean he looked kind of like a dick if you want my personal opinion but  
none	 sam she means he was  taliesin strapping  sam strapping like a dick  felicia well he is very large and we wont talk about that area i have seen it but lets not talk  about that either  travis what is your weapon of choice lyra  felicia oh i have a wand i have a wand its right here see its not very long  mary whats it made of  felicia oh its ash which its lovely its very nice do you want to know more  about it  mary i would love to 
none	  matt at which point the huntmaster arrives vanessa cyndrial steps into the room and looks  about the rest very nice to see that youve all gathered your teams for the day and i am also  curious to see your first foray into leading a group of slayers yourself lyra  felicia well i just want to thank you thank you vanessa thank you for entrusting me with  this group i have been reading up a lot lately im very excited to use the commanding presence of  a guild leader and prove my membership of the 
none	 guild  laura i would like to thank you very much as well  travis muffled yeah me too  laura for putting us in her capable hands  matt this was a more of a choice of convenience and a test universally as you are a  team of unproven fighters in the eyes of the guildhall and well we have a relatively  unproven member as well  felicia well i mean im a member  matt technically yes however i think that her knowledge and experience would be of very good use  on such a trek 
none	  mary yes it should prove to be quite educational i would think  sam well learn a lot from hearing her talk  felicia yay thank you  sam youre welcome  taliesin you should try the biscuits they are slaying me thats all i know  laura what do you eat do you eat does it get stuck in your teeth a lot  mary well it does sometimes but you grab a twig and just work it out after a while gives you a  little something later to chew on  travis twigs work great dont 
none	 they i like twigs  sam dont we have some guilds to prove membership to  travis yeah can we kill something now please before we learn anything else  matt she snaps her fingers loudly and mertin comes rushing from around the corner carrying  something in his arms as you are on this journey for us and for the guild and your own personal  name and title within our establishment we would like to provide you with a semblance of  protection or at least a useful little package a gift from us to you she puts 
none	 her hand on the  table and mertin comes over and hands you what looks like a small leather chest its made of  sculpted leather rolls back and pushes it forward you can hear the clinking of glass as he  does so and on the inside you can see there are four glass vials prepared with some sort of a  swirling red silverish liquid inside you recognize these as healingbased potions  sam like moderate healing  laura superior perhaps  matt these would constitute as greater healing potions and there are four in total you can 
none	  distribute as you see fit  sam i think the members of vox machina should get them  laura that doesnt seem really  mary is that what you think  sam well just because i i defer to  felicia as the leader i enjoy being hospitable and i agree with this small person  mary well scanlan if you feel you need it  taliesin i already have a couple so i will gladly give one to somebody  who is going to need it  laura ive got plenty take it if you need it  
none	 mary i have plenty myself thank you very much  sam i will more for me  matt very well now that we have this situated has everyone gathered the provisions they require  for this journey are you ready to embark  travis i mean we dont have a body bag for some of these chumps  sam did you eat enough percy  taliesin the biscuit was very filling it was extremely filling  felicia youre very welcome i can get some more can i just go to the kitchen and grab some no  matt anyway this 
none	 is a secondary gift temporarily lent out for your contracts mertin  brings up what looks like another satchel it has a series of metal snaps across the top these  little buttons that snap together and enclose it entirely its an overtheshouldertype throw as  he opens it and you look inside it resembles the bag of holding but its not quite a bag of holding  this is used for the transportation of how do you say perishable aspects of your quarry things  that you would harvest from the creature you have been assigned tend to depending 
none	 on the creature  rot away within a very short period of time when placed within this they should be sustained for a  few weeks at the very least so please do be very mindful and careful of this should it be lost  there is a very small chance you will be able to fulfill your contract so who shall be taking  this on the journey  sam youve already go the bag of holding  laura ill hold onto it  mary i shall  taliesin youre kind of stealthy arent you  mary i shall 
none	 take it  laura i shall take it  mary i shall take it  laura i will  travis roll for it  sam why dont we roll for why dont we flip a coin for it  mary do you know roshambo  sam that would be great  laura ha  mary congratulations im so happy for you  sam oh wait should we ask the leader of the group here  mary im so sorry  laura sorry lyra  felicia oh thats quite all right thank you for actually including me  laura of course 
none	  felicia as the leader of this party i will agree with the roshambo  sam chuckles so it is decreed  mary oh im so sorry i didnt mean for my tail to hit you in your rear end so sharply sometimes it  has a mind of its own  laura its like a whip  mary i know  matt at which point vanessa is just watching with a grin on her face it is good to see you have  already established a pecking order within your traveling companions this bodes well for your  journey 
none	 most certainly to you and she hands you the satchel  laura gasps but i won i won give it to me what please  mary im sorry i dont think it was given to you  laura i already have it i already have it on my shoulder its too late im writing it down  mary i certainly hope you dont lose it during our quest  travis vanessa i have a question what happens if we dont come back  with all of the members we left with  matt well then i suppose they would not 
none	 be allowed into the guildhall  travis oh good  matt mostly for no longer returning to the city of vasselheim but that is not our problem there  is danger in this which i should get to actually  sam yes please tell us where are we going  matt you have now received your gifts and your various required implements for this journey a  contract has just recently come to us from the crown of erathis within this portion of the city  it has been approved for slaying this will prove quite a challenge based on 
none	 how highly you spoke  of your abilities i will warn you the quarry is quite dangerous should you find yourself in  trouble i wish to remind you that it is better to live and fail than to be foolish and die let me  pass on to you the contract that has been selected for you then she reaches out and hands  this over to you percy  sam should lyra  felicia oh no let me try oh no maybe you should read it  mary i cast mending on it  sam you can do 
dung	 that so sexy  matt as she flicks her wrist a small spark of purpleish dark energy shoots from her finger  slams into the side of the contract and the tear in the contract repairs itself immediately  felicia oh wow  taliesin scotch tape would do it too  mary the scots have nothing to do with it  taliesin ordered and paid in advance by the alchemist oswind grund the client this  contract binding in honor of the elements set upon the agreed members of the slayers take  guildhall the task of locating and slaying

none	 is null  and void and the membership within the slayers take is revoked outside of the huntmasters  willful forgiveness  sam this is the fine print get to the details  taliesin quarry has been approved for hunting by the holy paramounts of the crown of erathis the  quarry one adult white dragon one adult white dragon  laura a white dragon would i know i would know because ive studied them  matt yes having dragons being a very favored enemy for you white dragons are one of the  chromatic dragon circle they are considered 
none	 largely very spiteful arrogant a little more  bestial and very very dangerous foes  mary yes they are glorious  laura didnt we kill a white dragon  travis and taliesin no  sam platinum dragon  laura no i thought the ice dragon thing wasnt she white  matt once upon a time you battled back at westruun  sam i dont see race so i dont know  felicia what kind of element is a white dragon  matt ice and frost  taliesin oh thats right  laura yeah the woman and then she turned into 
none	 a dragon  travis yeah ashley killed her i mean pike  matt this bodes well if you have already defeated such a creature then this should be a  very simple task  travis yeah no problem  felicia this is going to be easy  travis what do we have to bring back  taliesin they want eyes tongue heart claws and teeth  laura so anything else we get to keep ourselves  taliesin two eyes one tongue one heart six claws and 20 teeth is what they are requesting  sam and do we get paid 
none	 for such items  taliesin yes there are individual prices for each individual object eyes 900 gold each  tongue is 1200 gold the heart is 3500 claws 250 gold each and teeth are 50 gold each  felicia if there are any remaining organs we can roshambo for it  matt very good  laura and scales definitely there will be plenty of scales  taliesin plenty of scales  mary yes there will be plenty of scales very good for armor and  taliesin very good for armor  travis does it say where this dragon lives  
none	 taliesin no  matt ah see that is part of the job to find ones quarry is why we are so specialized in the  slayers take you may now embark once we signify the pact of the contract and as she reaches out  and touches the edge of it you can see there are these arcane sigils that are on the contract  itself they glow and pulse briefly and she just walks across the group first to you percy as  you were holding it place your hand against the contract as you do they light up 
none	 and you feel a  surge of warm energy go through your torso at which point you now see at the bottom of the  contract your name inscribe itself magically into the contract she then takes it and passes it  to each one of you to the same point as the spell binds  laura what about trinket does he use his paw  matt i suppose he is part of your band and she reaches out the paper  laura trinket shake  matt slams it out of her hand knocking the contract onto the ground and 
none	 there is a brief  moment where she pulls the paw back and the paper is wrecked a little bit but there is indeed a paw  that inscribes itself on the bottom of the contract for trinkets insignia now i have a  busy day to attend i wish you the utmost of safety good luck and safe travels  sam thank you i guess  felicia bye ill alphabetize the rest of those ingredients when i get back dont worry its  going to be fine  matt id appreciate that good luck  felicia okay great byebye 
none	 thanks again for giving me a chance  matt thats great please go  felicia okay  sam are you the housekeeper here  felicia no no listen no i am a guild member on a technicality but i am a guild member  mary tell me again what have you slain  felicia well well its  mary no very abbreviated just a short can you say the word of what it is  laura just the biggest one  felicia it was a worg who almost absconded with my boyfriend aldor  and at the last minute i 
none	 interceded  laura you killed someone who was sleeping with your boyfriend  felicia no no it was worg a worg  laura okay  sam is that a thing  felicia its a thing  sam we havent encountered one of those i dont think  laura its a person that changes into animals am i right  mary no its something that it projects itself into animals  matt in certain book series yes  laughter  mary im a very prolific reader and ive never read of worgs other than in that circumstance  sam in twilight 
none	 thats true  mary that could have been the fairy tale section of the library  travis it also sparkles sparkles in the sunlight  mary but only in the sun  matt worgs in this world are essentially a side breed of large bulbous wolflike entities  all oh  mary a bulbous dire wolf  laura oh you killed a wolf  mary a bloated wolf basically  felicia its a large wolf  matt its not quite dire wolf sized  laura no yeah thats great  mary a gaseous wolf  matt for instance out of 
none	 character here outside of the world in lord of the rings the  things that the orcs ride  all oh  laura oh theyre really scary  felicia it was quite a situation it was either the worg or aldor and i would do anything to save  aldor what did he look like when you saw him  travis oh god here we go again  sam he was a little dirty  laura i mean he looked actually kind of frightened  felicia was he wearing armor like a redish sort of very fantastic armor  sam 
none	 it was hard to focus on his armor with all of his screaming and panting  laura and whimpering really  felicia he is very brave he must have been injured  laura no yes he seems like he would have been had he hadnt  sam we tease because we love he did fine he fought well he fought bravely  and he treated us fairly  laura especially when he got burned by tiberius  felicia you burned my kindofboyfriend  sam not the face not the face  laura his face is fine  sam i didnt 
town	 do it  felicia we need to talk about this more on the road but we should get going  sam lets certainly start talking  mary yes lets do  matt as you all leave the huntmaster expectantly waiting for you to exit the guildhall you find  yourself out amongst the streets of vasselheim with no particular direction in where to find the  white dragon in three days  laura three days  matt three days to slay it yes  sam hey vex can any of us sense a dragon within six miles of here  
none	 laura thats what im doing im checking that out  felicia oh yes i can cast locate creature too  laura oh that works too  felicia yeah lets do it together  sam do we need some sort of anything for you to cast the spell  felicia oh no i have all of my ingredients  sam no but do you need to know something of what you are trying to locate  or does it work on name alone  matt as per the locate creature spell it can only locate creatures within 1000 feet of the 
none	  ritual that is completed but it locates them with pinpoint accuracy  laura oh thats great well then we can use it in conjunction because i can use primeval  awareness and find any dragons within six miles  felicia oh you are very skilled  travis can i try to grow my beard real quick  mary you can grow a beard  matt yes  sam sometimes  taliesin not really  travis 33  sam thats better thats better  matt at this point and you guys noticed it and didnt make a mention because for 
dung	 some of you  this was just a very dire morning but since grog woke up this morning he had a very very nice coat  of somewhat bristly translucent not very attractive facial hair  but facial hair by definition  laura its like fishing line coming out of his face  travis im a damn pirate now watch out  taliesin like a 14 year old whose father doesnt love him enough to  teach him how to groom himself  travis laughs jesus oh wow  sam thats dark  travis theres a story there  laura 
none	 percys seen some shit  mary yeah  taliesin theres no parental issues over here none  laura so can i do that then  matt you can you along with trinket by your side you find a small space  laura i cant find his exact location but i can  matt you can gather the general  mary how far away are we from the wood at this point  matt you are still in the city of vasselheim you are in the quadroads district which is the most  central portion of the city its the erathis 
none	 driven area you are about a 15 minute walk from  the nearest walls that exit out into the vesper timberlands  travis 15  felicia do i know anything about where the dragon might be  matt you have no idea this would be one of those occasions where your best bet would be research or  asking around  travis dragon drag  sam no dont do that  laura so can i  matt so you take a moment you ground yourself and you place your hands on the dirt and take in  the general feel 
none	 of all natural creatures and  unnatural beasts that you are attuned to in the  vicinity you focus on the essence of what is dragon and dragonkin dragon kind and  find that within the six mile radius there is nothing that catches your attention  laura shit  sam all right lyra lira lyra  felicia lyra thank you for asking because some people just dont care  sam yes well i want to get it right who youve been living here for quite some time i  imagine as a guild member  felicia well i grew 
none	 up here with my uncle uncle randy do you want to meet him  sam no unless he is knowledgeable about dragons i was going to ask you where should we go to ask  who might know things about the woods about the wilds about where dragons might keep  felicia thats a very good question i would say aldor but he will not talk to me  sam thats unfortunate  felicia it is really do you want to talk about it because i could use some advice  sam we can have some girl talk later but 
town	 right now focus on the dragon  laura zahra what about you do you know about dragons  mary i dont know where the dragons are but im so sorry i do not mean to interrupt but i  can use beast speech so if we come close to anything i could ask potentially to understand  maybe get an idea or  felicia there may be somebody at the abundant terrace who might know something about the woods  and direction that might be a good place to start its a section of town where they  concentrate on 
town	 yes so we can go there  laura all right lets do that  travis lets go there please god  matt all right so in following lyra towards the abundant terrace which is on the western side of  town this area is very different in visual style as soon as you approach this small hill that leads  into the terrace proper it is almost entirely farmland in this strange harsh environment there  is something about this entire district that is structured to be the source of vegetation and  crops and to be essentially feeding a 
none	 large portion of the population here you also see there  are a series of small temple towers and statues that are focused around a particular deity i  want you guys to go ahead and  roll religion real fast  laura roll a d20 and add your religion  mary starting off well  laura great first roll  felicia that roll is not good  sam 23  taliesin 22  matt which you know this information but before you can even say it as you are eager to mention  you sense that there is worship 
none	 of melora here melora which is considered the goddess of  wilderness and the sea and is one of the five soon to be six if pikes temple raises deities  that essentially rule the belief system and lifestyle of the city of vasselheim so through  the blessing and touch of melora in this district they are able to treat the land as magically  fertile territory to grow you gather upon stepping inside that theres a cluster of dirty  looking but very very cluttered and busy taverns inns and general stores like the entire  portion of 
tavern	 the district that isnt farmland is jammed into this one little corner go ahead and  make an investigation check  travis six  felicia 21  sam 22  laura 20  matt percy  taliesin 17  mary 17  matt 17 all right you guys split up a bit briefly to try and find more information one of  the groups that coalesces is vex scanlan and lyra the three of you come upon a place called  the midnight breath tavern you step inside and speak for a bit and eventually you meet the  coowner 
none	 a gentleman named dagon who is an older human who has what looks like a reddish but  somewhat patchy red and brown beard a couple scars on his body but nothing battle worn more  just a person who has existed in this harsh landscape for a while you guys are asking around  and talking about dragons mentioning dragons and somebody points in his direction and says ah  dragon youre gonna want to talk to dagon about that hes the one who sees dragons  laura sees them  sam lets go  felicia thats nice  
none	 travis i walk over to dagon  sam youre not with us are you  mary no  travis what  laura youre not with us  taliesin youre with me were still wandering about like idiots  matt you guys are wandering about  mary are we outside  matt you guys are in the process of asking around youll meet up  with them in just a moment  felicia vex youre very attractive use your wiles  laura oh thank you  sam her wiles kill  laura dagon is that your name  matt thats my 
tavern	 name hes cleaning a glass  laura ive heard many things about your knowledge of dragons  matt correct  laura yes  matt yyouve seen it youve seen the dragon  laura i have seen dragons and they suck  matt you hear a couple of snickers down the bar and he goes shut the hell up  laura unless you like them do you like them  matt no no one around here likes a dragon proper at least none that ive come across no  i swears it i swears it i saw this one i was 
town	 up north about two days travel northwest of here via  the glasswalk road thats two days travel horseback mind you  laura the glasswalk the glasswalk road  matt the glasswalk road yeah  laura yes of course  matt i was heading to muldire to you know visit my brother and some of my family lives up in that  northern area its freezing cold too chilly for my tastes but i was going to visit and no more  than two days up there a nasty blizzard blows in out of nowhere just starts wrecking the entire 
town	  roadside slick with ice we decide to go ahead and make camp me and a couple of the others who  were journeying with me we head off the road set up a small camp throw up some tents and  thankfully at least within the canopy of the forest its easy enough to escape the barrage of  the elements but it was a very very cold night our fire began to go out  and we were a little worried  laura and then there was a dragon  sam yeah get to the dragon im sorry 
none	  matt hold on let me tell my story  felicia that was very rude i am so sorry  sam im sorry im so sorry  matt its all right im used to it and a voice over there says yeah he is  you i will kick you out i will kick you  laura i believe that you saw a dragon and i believe that it was white because you were in a  blizzard right am i right  matt ill get to that patience now were sitting there and you get the feeling around  
tavern	 you that theres like eight other people in this tavern who are all face in their hands like  this story has probably been told dozens of times over and over again  so partway into the night were trying to keep warm when suddenly we hear this terrifying roar  that streaks across the sky we could hear it over the blistering sound of the snow and sleet  battered against our tent i rush outside to take a look not sure what to find but instead i see  what looks like a pack of four dire wolves 
none	 converging on our camp large nasty beasts  laura very much like a worg if you will  matt worglike a little larger yes  felicia how large do you want to tell how large proportionally would you say the no  okay keep going  matt well no i mean if you want to get into if youre talking worg versus dire wolf worg is  still pretty large about a good three four  felicia i know ive seen one you know what happened with me i got into the guild because  travis oh god here we 
none	 go  laura well actually dragon  matt so this pack of dire wolves are converging on me i myself am fearful but i know that if  im gonna make a stand now is the time to do it so i reach over and draw my dagger and prepare  myself to defend  laura thats a giant dagger if ive ever seen one  matt thank you he resheathes it a little blush to his cheeks i prepared myself to accept  possible defeat at these terrifying beasts then a secondary roar breaks out this time not from 
none	  around but above incoming streaking out of the clouds above i see believe me a dragon  wingspan huge claws and teeth gnashing  laura i would never have guessed thats where that was going white dragon  matt white as the snow that encased the skyline it streaks down and snatch takes one of the worgs  in its jaws lifts up the worg screeching about angrily it throws it into the air and from its  mouth cascades a blistering freezing cascade of ice and sleet  the worg itself freezes in midair  laura whoa  
none	 matt before it can plummet the creature then closes its jaws snatching down on that worg and  biting it in two only one fell stroke as the pieces of ice clatter to the ground the rest of  the worgs scatter i believe that dragon saved our lives that night  laura thats great how did you make it back without dying  matt well apparently the dragon had its fill and the dire wolves went off so we packed up and went  right on back never made it to muldire  laura did the dragon keep flying 
town	 in the direction of the glasswalk road or did it go east or west  or which way  matt i have no idea actually we just ran we turned tail and got the hell out of there as fast  as we could  sam that was quite a story quite a story  felicia that was stirring  matt you believe me you believe me on this  laura we believe you  sam not only do we believe you but we want to tell others of this in fact im a bit of a performer  i 
none	 may write a song about your exploits  matt could you  laura actually could i roll for perception or insight to see if hes  telling the truth on everything  matt go ahead and roll insight  sam roll two  laura oh yeah two no 17  matt 17  laura no is that a 17 or an 11  travis 11  mary thats 11  laura 17  matt 17 all right hes not the most complicated man so reading his intent is easier than a lot  of individuals youve had to keep an 
tavern	 eye on previously he is eager to tell the story and is  in full belief the frustration and the only things that detract from his childlike excitement  at telling this tale is his moments of side looking frustration to the other members of the  tavern that do not take him seriously it seems dagon does seem to be truthful in at least  believing what he is saying to you  felicia thank you so much for your information i take a gold coin and im just like is this  enough yes thats good thank you 
none	 so we well be going yeah  laura can i perception and see how heavy that bag of gold actually looks i just want to know  matt make a perception check  laura okay im going to roll the gold dice 24  matt 24 as she reaches into the pouch there is a rather large visibly bulging pouch to her side  that is in no way shape or form even attempting to be covertly hidden  sam shes got a scrooge mcduck bag  laughter  matt seemingly  mary does it make her limp so sorry 
none	  felicia oh goodness guys we are going to have to get some warm clothing it seems like that so  lets go shopping  laura i love this plan  travis oh god  sam dagon dagon  matt it is dagon remember the name dagon for your song  sam i will definitely write a song for you  matt i can write it down for you  sam no i can remember that will we have any trouble finding this place will we need a guide  someone whos possibly been there before would that make the 
none	 journey  matt oh i aint going back yalls crazy if youre going back there i would say just look for  where the blizzard is coming from that seemed to be the harbinger of the beast  laura go to the blizzard  travis two days on horseback or two days walking  matt two days on horseback up the glasswalk  felicia oh my gosh well have to get horses too well lets go  laura does the guild give you money for  felicia um  matt as far as you know horses are provided to fullfledged 
none	 hunting members you got the feeling  in your very very brief preparation for this that part of the test was to secure your own  transportation  laura lovely  felicia i think we are on our own i mean i think its part of our perseverance to prove that  we are worthy of being i mean i am in the guild just to be clear  sam youre a member  felicia we are just going to have to yes i am a member did you hear how i got in it is really  a fascinating 
none	 story  sam no i heard it was sort of a technicality  felicia oh well it was but  sam i cant wait to hear it  felicia maybe around the campfire  sam yes  felicia you could sing  sam i could if you told me the details you know what i do forget a lot maybe you could just  write them down quietly to yourself and just give me a note later  felicia okay as long as its a love story between me and aldor ill tell you how to spell  it okay 
none	 well lets go meet the rest of the group  sam thank you dagon  laura as were leaving i walk up behind lyra and i put my hand on her shoulder and then i reach  down and grab her bag of gold and i clears throat and look down to it and say you might  want to keep a better eye on this darling there are very very nasty people around  felicia oh my goodness  sam youre traveling with some of them  laura i didnt take anything im simply letting you know  felicia 
tavern	 that is so nice of you im going to buy you the prettiest cloak as thanks  laura thank you so much darling you have lovely eyes  felicia thank you ive never had a friend before this is so great  laura maybe when we shop you can tell me all about aldor  felicia oh my gosh he is so handsome  matt as you guys step out of the tavern you walk up to the other members of your party zahra grog  and percy  taliesin oh thank god  mary what have you discovered

none	 are we going to do that exactly  travis i mean im not the brightest in the bunch but  matt you know that contracts are complete upon the quarry being slain  all oh  felicia we have three days to get home its hard you were reading it a little bit fast  mary two days to get there and one day to slay it  laura thereabouts yes  mary is that about it  matt once the creature is actually slain and the pieces are harvested then the contract is  completed then you can take 
none	 your time returning  travis thank god  mary great we can ride it down the mountain  travis really  mary no  sam we need to get some horses up in this joint  felicia we need horses we need cloaks we need furs wools  laura we definitely need warm things actually i have warm cloaks for the party and half of our  party isnt here so we can have them  sam will you need some cold weather clothes zahra  mary i believe it would be nice  sam and lyra did you bring

town	 bury the lede  mary lyra does he have access to horses  felicia um i dont  matt you havent ever had any sort of discussions with him in regards to horses you know there are  a few liveries throughout town but you dont think you have any family ties to them directly  felicia not directly i mean its trade more than that but i know some places  sam is this your uncle randy  felicia uncle randy yes you know about him  sam hes legend his legend has been sung far and wide  
none	 felicia hes so fantastic hes so kindhearted he took me in when i was anyway well talk about  it over fire camps  taliesin come on everybody  laura so can we find horses in the area  matt you briefly look about and you find a livery not too far from the outskirts of this district  as you enter the gentleman who runs it there is eager have you come to buy some horses well  certainly  sam rent them lets rent them for a week  matt the thing about renting is in this area 
none	 if youre riding out with horses a lot of them dont  make their way back  laura how about we rent them and if they dont make their way back well pay you the difference  sam well leave you a hefty deposit  matt that could possibly work yes  mary may i cast suggestion  laura oh try it do it  mary are you all right am i all right to  sam go for it  mary i cast suggestion  matt okay so while you guys are in this conversation you stay back and 
none	 make a few symbols  with your fingers whispering under your breath you complete the suggestion spell whats the dc  of your spell it should be on the top of your spell page the top of your actual sheet that has  all your things listed  laura dc 17  matt all right what do you want to suggest  mary you shall lend us the horses knowing that we shall take very good care of them we may keep  them for as long as we like  matt as youre having this conversation he looks over 
none	 at the group and goes you know what you  all look like a very trustworthy group i wouldnt wanna breed any sort of ill will for future  business  laura right i mean uncle randy after all  matt tell you what ill give you the horses rental half price i trust youll bring em back  dont worry about any sort of deposit i believe youre trustworthy folk  sam wow thank you sir  laura thats lovely  matt so for six horses were look for a rental price of around say 50 gold for the

none	 no  sam i always want to leave trinket  laura why do you always wanna leave my wonderful bear  sam because he only almost dies every time  laura i know he almost dies every time i put him in battle its ridiculous  felicia i think hes adorable and it would be  really nice to have him along  laura he is adorable isnt he  felicia you guys its so beautiful to see the friendship that you have if i had that with  another person say aldor it would be  sam aldor is 
none	  travis oh god do you have any clydesdales or giant horses for me  taliesin have you thought of getting a cat by any chance  felicia hm  taliesin just a suggestion i dont know  matt i think we could probably facilitate i cant say that itll have much of a shelf life  depending on how much you ride it but  travis thats what people say about me thats fine  matt he pulls out a very very nice looking warhorse that looks like its designed to carry  very heavy soldiers still unproven as 
none	 to whether or not it will be able to carry you  but we shall see  travis yeah  matt and once again the horse travel wasnt two days of straight gallop it was  laura oh okay  matt a casual trot in which trinket could probably keep up but you guys might have to take  a break every now and then because hes still a bear  laura okay well its doable  travis make him earn it  taliesin at the bearest mean  matt oh  taliesin ive got like five more ive been 
none	 saving them up for this entire game  sam i missed  taliesin nothing no its nothing  travis oh puns yeah  matt for every bear pun that happens an angel loses its wings  mary so do we give you our gold and  sam yes yes heres our gold  matt certainly certainly ill get you your horses  laura wait whos whos paying  travis the party is  laura but it half our party isnt here so  travis vex  felicia ill just dont dont ill just do it  sam oh thank you

none	 this and the fact that you pulled out a spell and did not  say and it is just its just not even the way i want to conduct my team so you if youre  going to use underhanded tactics you need to clear them with me first because i am the leader  mary my spellcasting is actually overhand but  felicia wha  mary i understand and i shall keep that in mind and i do apologize  felicia really  mary yes i apologize very deeply very very sincerely  felicia i was just a leader

town	 embark on the glasswalk road which forms right on the outskirts of the braving  grounds you are let through the front gates of the outside of the vesper timberlands and this is  the first time youve actually seen a formal road that is carved and at least traversed enough that  the timberland hasnt completely consumed it you can still see various tree roots and branches are  progressively almost angrily pushing in towards this gate but you get the feeling based on the  cuts that whoever goes through here at least some people go through here 
none	 they keep it  relatively wellkept for travel up north you ride out into it and the canopy almost completely  encloses it so its like a tunnel of very dense tree vine and leaf structure you push forward  out into the cold air and begin to ride for the remainder of the day a good eight or nine hours  hit before the chill begins to grow the sun begins to find itself setting across the far  mountains and the forest around you grows darker and darker still  laura probably need to make camp  felicia 
none	 i think we should make camp  i should we make camp yes we should  make camp  mary i shall take first watch  travis i have a firewood bundle that we can make a fire with  laura theres also lots of wood around grog  mary yes  travis and i have an axe lets do that instead can i find a really tiny tree and start hacking  away at it  sam tiny  travis yeah tiny we dont need to kill like grandpa tree we kill baby tree  laura keyleth would be 
town	 proud  travis dont how about dont tell keyleth  laura i miss my brother  matt okay you guys get off of the main road as thats probably not a very good area to be out in  the open you find after about a five to ten minute walk a small opening and along the way you  find a tree that looks viable theres a small slope of hill that heads up to an upper platform  area maybe about five to ten feet up and a small opening that you think would be a fitting place 
none	 to  put a fire that wouldnt be in danger of setting the nearby vegetation aflame you go ahead and  start looking for firewood go ahead and make an athletics roll  travis 16  matt all right after a good 15 20 minute period relatively brief for most folk you come  back with a nice hefty stack of firewood from the driest small tree you could find  laura good job grog  travis hey zahra  mary well done  travis impressed  mary yes  laughter  sam kords strength to you sir  matt 
none	 throwing the wood down you begin to set up small stones into a fire pit establishment and  begin building a fire as the entirety of the sun disappears behind the distant mountain range at  this point the temperature has gotten extremely cold and most of you begin to pull up your winter  cloaks and get your bedrolls ready for an evenings bit of rest is there anything in  particular that you guys want to do before the night and sleep take you  mary i would like to go out has the moon risen  matt 
none	 about two hours into nightfall you can see a gentle bit of moonlight begin to appear off the  distant horizon to the northeast from your position its hard to see because the trees are  so thick but you take a moment to walk through and you can see little bits of  the moonlight peeking  mary i just bask in what little rays i can for ten 15 minutes before retiring  matt all right anything else you wish to do  felicia im going to change my stone my transmuter stone to be resisting ice or 
none	 cold  laura ah thats really good  taliesin clever  matt good call good call indeed  laura i need something like that do we have any magic stuff that makes us resistant  mary i have a ring of protection may i do that around the camp  matt the ring of protection is an actual ring you wear  mary oh i have a ring  matt yes and it protects you  mary and it protects me  matt yep laughs  mary you see im learning everything not all at once  laura i have

none	 lifting your axe and begin to take a few steps away from the camp as  you turn around one of the nearby tree trunks the first thing youre greeted by in the darkness do  you have darkvision  travis i have low wait the dwarven belt of beard power gives me i have darkvision out to a  range of 60 feet  sam wow  matt you do so as you turn the corner you get about a step before you notice about 15 feet away  from you  sam your beard tingles  matt there

none	 dire wolflike creature is currently staring at you  across the way and you see other entities humanoid coming towards you as your darkvision  allows you to take up their features you can see these are very heavily fur covered dense leather  armor protected roving band of straight up orcs that are currently converging on the campsite from  the center of the woods what are you going to do  travis you look like someone i just saw recently i would like to rage and i will charge the dire  wolf puppything and swing at its 
none	 head with my greataxe  matt all right so you immediately go into a grogstyle charge you guys can hear grog yelling  in furious anger echoing through the nearby wood in the direction you heard his initial shout that  woke you up grog you rush forward towards the dire wolf go ahead and make your two attacks  travis 26  matt that hits  travis ah 25  matt both hit  travis that was really good  matt nice go ahead and roll some damage  travis thank you ten and 18 is 28  matt 
none	 great so as you rush forward your axe hits into the side of the dire wolf  slamming into its shoulder you can see as you draw the axe out of the wound youve left a nice  hearty gash into the muscle tissue that holds its arm to its shoulder the other one as you bring  your axe around the other side it slams into the upper part of its back it sinks a good three or  four inches into it and the dire wolf rrgaaah just reacts to the pain with a guttural screech  and 
none	 then looks up at you releasing its lips apart for these nasty looking sharp long dire wolf  fangs revealed as it prepares itself to pounce back that ends your turn  travis yeah  matt as part of this round the dire wolf is going to return as the two nearest orcs charge in  to flank grog  mary oh no  matt this guy is going to move one two three six cant quite there is going to  use its action to dash in here and loom over so as youre waking up you see this 
none	 orc come  lumbering around one of the trees  felicia gasps  sam oh no you youre eating  matt  with this giant club and just gets in front of you as youre freaking out  another one flanks around and comes up towards percy  taliesin hm  matt another one rushes up behind scanlan there and you see behind another growl and a series  of heavy footfalls as not quite an ogre not quite an orc like some sortof ogreorc  crossbreed comes walking behind one of the other trees to go up behind percy 
none	 on that side  laura oh god  sam oh my grog  felicia oh no  travis laughs oh my grog  matt and from the far end over here another orc moves forward one two three four five six  and hes going to use his action to finish his movement here on percy as well  taliesin oh god  laura are they attacking percy  matt yes currently theres only two attacks on you from this ogrelike creature and this orc oh  thats not going to be very good that would be a nine  
none	 taliesin no  matt whats your ac  taliesin 18  matt 18 that is not going to hit and then we also have thatll be a 22  taliesin thats going to hit  matt all right so the giant ogreish type creature comes rushing towards you swings with  its giant club and slams the ground next you as you manage to roll out of the way and get up to  your feet and as you do the orc to the other side swings with what looks like a heavy axe and it  nicks you in 
none	 the side of the shoulder blade dealing 12 points of slashing damage  taliesin hm  matt we have this guy just barely gets to scanlan scanlan as youre standing up one of the  orcs rushes up behind and you see hes holding another large doublehanded great axe  sam i sing sings no i dont want to get hurt by you doo doo doo doo  matt all right go ahead and roll the d10 to reduce the attack modifier on that one  travis laughs where does this come from  matt rolled a 24 by the 
none	 way  sam okay so i reduce that by two  matt 22  sam yes so hell still hit but he got a song out of it  travis laughs lucky bastard  matt well there you go all right that will come to another 12 points of slashing damage as the  axe swings down you manage to just pull out of the way so it hits the armor and deflects but it  leaves a huge gash in the front of the armor and just the sheer weight of it kind of shook you for  a 
none	 second  sam ahh  matt thatll bring us to grog who is currently being heavily flanked first the dire wolf is  going to snatch at you because its not happy with your series of attacks and with pack tactics it  has advantage because its within five feet of other allies so its bite attack against you with  advantage is a natural 20  laura oh no  felicia oh no  matt using my new critical role dice  laura were all going to die  taliesin thanks chatroom thank you  felicia yes chatroom  
none	 matt its 21 points of piercing damage from the jaws which is reduced  by half because of your rage  travis yes so 11  matt yep that finishes the dire wolfs turn the two other orcs are also going to swing at you from  the sides they have advantage because theyre flanking you thats going to be a 17  travis misses  matt and then with advantage on that one 16 also misses theyre just swinging  at you with no effect that completes the surprise round the orcs have pounced onto your campsite  back 
none	 at the top of the order we have percy what are you doing first  taliesin going to cry a little so i have three orcs basically or two orcs and a  godknowswhat  matt yeah its too small to be an ogre but its too big to be an orc a very unholy union of the  two probably created this spawn  taliesin the first thing im going to do is im going to take a fire shot to the right to that  giant monstrosity and spend a grit point to try to shoot him in 
none	 the foot  matt okay  taliesin  makes a constitution saving throw okay these rules are new so pardon me if im a  little iffy so shot with pepperbox is wow whats wrong with me 28 to hit  matt 28 definitely hits he has to make a saving throw or be knocked prone  taliesin well yeah theres damage plus a saving throw  he has to make a constitution saving throw  matt all right  taliesin eight plus my proficiency modifier plus my dexterity modifier  matt four plus six so it would be 18 
none	  taliesin its actually ten 18 yeah youre right  matt yeah he does not make that so you shoot he gets knocked prone as you shoot  his foot out from under him he stumbles to one knee and then you just kick out and push him onto  his back thats the first shot  taliesin and it does six points of damage im sorry it does 12 points of damage plus three  points of fire damage  matt nice  taliesin and now my other shot marking that off im going to shoot him while hes 
none	 down  matt okay  taliesin so do i get a bonus to hit there  matt you have advantage because hes prone  taliesin okay i get advantage so im actually using  matt hes right there in front of you and hes not able to really dodge effectively so im going  to give you advantage on this attack  taliesin okay so im using sharpshooter then  travis get him percy  taliesin thank god natural 20 so this is going to suck for him  matt which regenerates your grit point you just used by the 
none	 way  taliesin does it im back to three  matt you get a grit point whenever you crit  taliesin every time i crit thats right math okay so i get double points  right thats how this  matt roll the dice and double the number you get  taliesin okay oh that kind of sucks seven 14 24 25 30 points of damage  cheering  matt while its on the ground it looks up at you and snarls you removed your boot from where you  kicked it down you bring the gun down aim it 
none	 and give it a glare as you fire with the  pepperbox as you do you blast part of its jaw off and you see it you see blood  starting to trickle and pour down the front of its chest and its trying to get up angrily reaching  for its club which is currently in the half snow floor of this forest interior its looking pretty  rough but its looking very intent on getting vengeance on you  taliesin out of idle curiosity if i try to make a break for it they would get two attacks 
none	 of  opportunity against me right  matt yes yes they are harrying you pretty heavily right now  taliesin ooh that doesnt make my life any better does it no never mind then  travis do it percy  taliesin actually you know what im pulling an action surge two more shots  matt go for it  taliesin im shooting him two more times while hes on the ground  matt all right  taliesin same thing with a plus ten to hit with a sharpshooter  matt yep he still has  taliesin disadvantage  matt advantage 
none	 to your shot because hes still on the ground  taliesin 23 to hit  matt 23 hits go ahead and roll damage on that  taliesin lets see sorry trying to do this five plus 16 so 21 points of damage  matt 21 points of damage all right with that shot as its getting up and reaches for its club  it gets hold of it and starts bringing it in an arc towards you you lower the gun again this  time shooting for the other side of its face with an echoing blasting sound you see 
none	 the  remainder of its lower jaw and head just blown out the back of it its eyes roll back  cheering  laura instakill  travis damn one turn  taliesin and now im going to take that last shot and swing up and shoot at the one thats to  the right of  matt this one  taliesin that one right there  matt okay go ahead and roll to attack  taliesin oh god natural 20  travis what the fuck  felicia what the heck  laura this is the best night for percy ever 
none	  taliesin im just sitting in the corner going maniacal laughter  travis you were sleeping are you doing all this naked since you were woken up so quickly  laura yes definitely  taliesin im in the pajamas with the butt flap and the butt flap is down  mary yes  taliesin the butt flap is down  travis i applaud  matt all right good to know because that will affect your armor class  taliesin and thats eight 16 26 27 28 29 31 32 points of damage  matt 32 points of damage  travis 
none	 what the what  laura thats insane  taliesin its a crit  laura can we all get inspiration from seeing percy just massacre  felicia its like a john woo film right now  travis yeah right with the doves  matt you all are a little distracted by the other ones that are currently pushing in you hear the  explosions and you see off to the corner but you have too many things around you right now okay  so as you pull back the gun the orc thats in front of you thats currently holding its 
none	 one  handed axe with two hands is rearing back you fire right towards its face it tries to duck out  of the way and you smack into its shoulder with an explosion you can see its leather armor  splinters and its fur kind of burns and curls back from the flame of the blast and beneath you  can see that most of the muscle tissue and exposed bone is visible as youve blown a giant crater in  its shoulder  laura gross  taliesin that was brilliant im done sorry  matt grog youre up 
none	  travis im up i would like to go into a frenzied rage now that ive got all my playmates around me  and i would like to take one giant swing in a half circle trying to get all three at one time  matt all right so attack for each one go for it  travis so thats a 22  matt that hits the orc dire wolf  travis thats a 23  matt hits and for the last orc  laura hell yeah  travis 26 25  matt okay roll damage three times and its 
none	 in order this orc over here  travis 15 12 and 17  matt all right as you whoosh swing the axe around it clips across the chest of the orc who  is almost pushed off his feet from the sheer force the axe swings slams into the front  throat chest area of the dire wolf with so much force that it cuts clean through leaving this open  wound where its main veins just begin to pour its lifeblood  felicia ew  matt the dire wolf just gurgles for a second before slumping onto the ground 
none	 motionless  with the inertia carrying through its body it slams into the other orc who actually has a  small buckler shield that manages to catch it shatters most of the leather and metal that  encompasses the piece getting stuck into his forearm and he yells in your face  with this kind of guttural shout and he pulls his own arm off the blade of the axe  as you withdraw it  travis ooh  matt that concludes your turn its now their turn all you low initiative rolling motherfuckers  got to wait  laughter 
none	  mary sings mother motherfucker  matt lets see first and foremost the two guys that are in that motion the two orcs that you  just slammed rear back and then retaliate very heavily against you they both have advantage  because they have you flanked thatll be 22  travis hits  matt and a 14  travis misses  matt yes all right so the one with the buckler and what looks like a longsword strikes you for  eight points of slashing damage of which you take four  travis great  matt that ends their 
none	 turn the one orc thats overtop of you lyra goes rggh and swings  in a wide arc down towards you  thats going to be a 14  felicia i have a 13  matt aw okay so as its two handed axe swings down on top of you you take six points of  slashing damage  felicia ouch  matt you instinctively freak out and back up out of the way and it actually doesnt hit you it  slams into your bedroll but the sheer impact shakes you and you can feel the sweat beginning to 
none	  pour from your forehead thats going to bring us to this guy here whos attacking scanlan thats  going to be a 12  sam miss  matt he swings towards your head thankfully hes not used to attacking things so small you duck  quickly out of the way  sam fuck you  laughter  matt and thats oh and the two on percy who are now looking for retribution theyre looking  a little shaken by the whole experience the one that you shot in the shoulder too  taliesin im just screaming in their face 
none	 like a manic pixie screams  felicia manic pixie dream gunslinger  taliesin thank you  matt thatll be a 20  taliesin i walked into that  matt 20 to hit  taliesin im going to spend a grit point and wait if my armor class is 20 does that mean they  still hit  matt i thought you were wearing your pajamas with the butt flap  all oh  sam details details  laurathats so mean  taliesin one day far in the future ill figure out a way to make you pay for that  
none	 laughter  taliesin for now fine that hits  matt sometimes you this is what i heard  taliesin damn it  travis the visualization was worth it alone  matt and 22 for the second attack  taliesin that hits  matt so both of them strike at once you dont quite know which way to dodge and as you try to  duck out of the way both blades hit you simultaneously on the sides  laura oh no  matt you take four points of damage from one rolled really low  that one rolled pretty high 
none	 you take 12  taliesin 12 total  matt the total would be 16  taliesin okay 16  matt you take 16 points of slashing damage from the two of those orcs now we come to scanlan  sam okay i turn to the orc who just missed me and i cast dominate person  travis yes  sam with my through my hand cone of clarity of course  matt all right so as you finish your casting of the spell you can see the anger in its face  suddenly drop and subside and it gives you 
none	 this expectant look  sam i command him to protect our goliath with his life if he needs to  and retreat from me instantly  matt okay it nods and looks over towards where grog is and with this kind of slack  jawed expression turns and looks like its ready to make its way towards grog next round do you  want to move at all or are you staying here  sam i will move a step towards lyra  matt all right yeah hes not currently threatening you because he is controlled by you  so 
none	 you step back with the fire to your back you can feel the heat flickering behind you  sam and i will just be backup for her and i also will inspire her  matt all right  sam with a little i turn to her and i start singing sings and i raise my hand to lyra and  say that you could use some scanlan today tonight i give you a d10  laughter  matt so with that you have a d10 inspiration dice that you can add to any d20 roll you need to make  
none	 it could be an attack could be a saving throw  felicia okay great thank you  matt you can roll and if thats not enough you can add a d10 to it  felicia okay great thats so nice  matt so that ends scanlans turn vex youre up  laura okay im going to cast how many people are on percy  matt two currently flanking him right there  laura im going to do hunters mark on the damaged one  matt okay  laura should i get yeah the one thats damaged  matt the one

none	 orc to  the side with a flicker of slightly shimmering white energy you can see your attention focus and  clarity crystallize on this one orc who glances over at you returning the gaze  laura 19 attack  matt 19 attack does hit and as the arrow is released from your bow  laura yes  matt go ahead and roll damage  laura plus the d10 for the flaming 17 to hit and then trinkets attacks  matt yep roll twice for trinket as the arrow sploof hits him on the chest area and boom  bursts 
none	 into flames igniting part of his shoulder as he looks down you hear this guttural growl from  around the corner as he glances over trinket comes jumping out of the shadows  from behind the tree  laura trinket i never know what to look at because i never attack with trinket  matt attack bonus  laura okay thats 22 for one  matt 22 hits roll for the second attack  laura the second one is a 16  matt 16 just barely hits  laura oh my goodness  sam trinkets doing something  laura i

none	 for the first one  matt 11 for the first one all right  laura and then the second one this is so new and exciting and 12 for the second  matt all right so as trinket rushes around the corner with one claw whacks hits him in the back  of the shoulder sending him onto the ground the orc now shoulder in flames is on its back  trinket leaps on top reaches down and with its jaws around its head  just bites the head off  all ohh  matt as you see the head

none	 and for a second your eyes which are normally a vibrant bright  white suddenly close with this darkness and then reveal a pale blue like the moon in the sky as  you do this hue of light blue energy begins to emanate from this orc right there he looks down  confused as you pull your staff up and slam the ground with it as you do these three streaks of  pale blueish green energy streak out towards it  mary ha  matt go ahead and roll three attacks  mary oh my god  matt 
none	 adding your bonus your spell bonus to each one  mary 13 plus 11  laura so 24  mary 24  matt that hits  mary that was a good one 30  matt 30 okay  sam what  mary and 21  matt are you adding the plus  mary oh and plus two to each of them  laura thats damage  mary oh im sorry so its eldritch blast it gets plus 11  matt right so what was the last one  mary 21  matt they all hit so go ahead and roll

none	 right two  mary six  laura fuck  matt eight total  mary five  travis whoa  matt 13  laura its like a hunters mark all on your own  matt so after the beams streak out all three blast simultaneously into the torso area of the  orc thats standing by percy its glaring at you with this look of surprise and fury and  frustration and before it can even try and mount any sort of attack the three beams strike it in  the chest you can see this scattering of brackish liquid as 
none	 the back of its torso is blown out like  a shotgun blast  mary yes  matt and it falls to the ground with this gurgle in its throat and for a second you  swear you see the glistening moonlight colored energy that you had hexed upon it almost sucks the  soul from its body and then it dissipates into the air above it  mary thaumaturgy makes my eyes go fire  laughter  sam wow  matt a big blast of flame great so that will end your turn there  travis you did really 
none	 well  laura how is she so cool  sam she just changed the game  matt that will bring us to lyra  travis she can stay  felicia is that 30 feet  matt five 10 15 20 25 30 30 foot is right there from you  felicia who are the bad guys this one this one and this one  matt this one this one and these two there  felicia okay so im like screams oh that was cool okay pff and i use my chain  lightning you have to do a save on

none	 away unfortunately this guy is not  felicia oh okay get that guy  matt as you freak out you back up and as an instinctual maneuver you put your fingers out and  there is a loud crackling sound as a condensed thunderstorm blasts forth from lyras hands the  orc thats threatening her and actually managed to try and strike you gives you this look of sudden  pity before its entire upper body is fried instantly from the electricity that just  destroys you can see all its flesh is now curled back and cracking from the 
none	 sheer amount of energy  thats flowing through it the bolt then streaks off and slams the one that you dominated that was  currently running in the other direction all of a sudden gets hit in the side however maintains  the domination  laughter  matt he did take half damage to that one but this one is blown off the map the other one over  here is looking pretty rough now its hobbling forward currently with  one of its legs ruined  laura laughs that poor orc  matt its pretty rough its been a 
none	 rough day for him do you want to stay where you are or do you  want to move  felicia ill stay where i am wow that worked  sam wow that was amazing  i turn around and sort of barf because i just saw a guys upper half get incinerated  laughter  mary suck it up scanlan  matt all right top of the round percy grog  taliesin you first or i im going to start running towards grog  matt okay  taliesin how far can i get about that far and while im 
none	 running im just going to take oh  hello where are we there we are im just going to take two pot shots at him as im running by  sam my dominated guy is not going to live to see his  taliesin and just because i dont really care im going to take the negative the sharpshooter plus  damage negative to that so  matt okay  taliesin 16  matt 16 does hit  taliesin and ill just do both right now and  felicia oh my god  laura did you get another 20  
none	 felicia yes  taliesin i got another 20  felicia thats a very good dice thats a very good die  travis you can spread them out over several games you dont have to  laura we have to fight dragons soon a dragon  taliesin thank you this is phenomenal i know ive got such terrible things that are going to  happen to me because of all this good luck so thats ill do the first one really quickly  thats 20 points of damage for the first shot  travis leave none alive my boy  matt 
none	 first shot smacks into its thigh and you can see where once there was an actual functional  thigh area is now a splintered femur that is exposed through one side of his leg you can see  its barely keeping itself standing it roars out raaah in pain as you fire again  taliesin 32 points  matt with the final bullet in your pepperboxs chamber the sixth bullet  you fire the last round  taliesin youre going to make me change the sharpshooter thing by the  end of this round i get the  matt no 
none	 no no sharpshooter works well for a reason  taliesin its kind of spectacular i keep rolling 20s i keep rolling 20s  matt thats what the dice does man its worked poorly in your favor before  taliesin really poorly normally  matt its great when it works awesomely so with this look of confusion as this orc thats trying  to do the bidding of this gnome that  sam protect our goliath  matt its trying desperately to go and protect grog but on the way there it gets its leg blown  out and then suddenly 
none	 it turns and the shot enters one side of its temple and out the other  and theres just this very quick shpt sound as it falls to the ground motionless and is no longer  a living organism  sam good job percy i sort of had that guy covered but its all good its all good  taliesin im coming grog  matt grog youre up  travis for the gentleman that im facing right now i would like to take my first swing  matt all right  travis well all right 24  matt 24 that 
none	 hits  travis and that is 19 points of damage  matt whew all right  travis ill take my second swing at him  matt same guy  travis same guy  matt all right go ahead and roll for that  travis 26  matt that hits  travis laughs also 19 points of damage  mary after the hammer orcs are nothing  matt so the first strike you slam into his upper torso area and it actually digs about four or five  inches in he reaches up and grabs drops his weapon and grabs the 
none	 axe and tries to pull it out  of his body you however reach up with your fist and slam it down on the axe shoving it about five  or six more inches you can see his actual shoulder and arm fall away from his torso as his  eyes roll back and he falls limp against the blade  travis with my third attack id like to turn to his friend grab him by the throat and go its  death or target practice for my friends talk  matt go ahead and make an intimidation roll  
none	 travis yay 19  matt all right the orc looking at its current fate and the rather rapid destruction of its  entire band speaks orcish anyone here speak orcish  mary i speak orc so my friend  laura what did he say what did he say  matt you hear him say death may come but the rest will find you you come into our wood its  only a matter of time before youre eaten  laura tell him were just passing through  mary we are simply passing through we are in search of something if 
none	 you choose to help us we  may let you live  travis yeah may  mary and it is not one of yours  matt go ahead and make a persuasion roll  mary what do i roll  travis 20  mary what do i add to it  sam plus your persuasion  travis nine  laura heck yeah  mary 24  travis okay  matt as youre speaking to him in his own language his  mary speaks orcish  travis bless you  matt laughs you guys hear these horrible guttural sounds almost as 
none	  good as keyleths giant  travis almost  matt almost you can see a look of fear and his eyes dart about the rest of the party as they all  begin stepping out of the firelight and into the darkness surrounding him he gauges the scenario  looks down at the dead dire wolf he gives you another look and you still have the flaring blaze  of your angry thaumaturgy eyes he says in common very broken common very well i live i serve  you can see his blood now trickling down to the corner of 
none	 his mouth  laura what is he going to fight with us  felicia can i see if hes truthful insight  matt make an insight check  felicia aw thats not my strength  matt you can certainly try though  felicia oh good i rolled a four  sam plus two  felicia plus two  mary thats a six  matt he looks constipated thats the best way you can read it  laura can i try as well  matt youre welcome to  travis constipated  matt youre concerned briefly for the diet he  
none	 usually eats vex you wanna go ahead  laura 16 is what i rolled  matt 16 ah there is definitely an intent for selfpreservation but there is that  fightorflight look in the eyes as well  travis let me kill him  laura well lets find out about our dragon first  felicia oh i can cast friend on him  mary no because hell know youre casting magic and then hell come back at you  laura will he  matt he will  felicia is that why it never worked on aldor  mary yes and 
none	 hell come back and attack you afterwards and it can only be used for  laura how do you know  mary friends well i can cast friends  matt friends however has to be on something thats not hostile and you get the feeling that  even though hes currently docile hes probably a little hostile  felicia okay okay i guess well just go without  mary suggestion only works but mass suggestion works for a long time  laura why dont we just ask him  sam yeah we got him we can kill him in a 
town	 second if we have to so  mary you know we can kill you  laura theres a dragon where is it  mary we are looking for a dragon specifically a white dragon and we know it is to the north  sam west  mary  west  matt this beast i see in the sky takes those who do not hide look for the tallest mountain  that way and points up the north area a little ways off the road and in the direction youre  travelling it takes refuge top of the mountain there is 
none	 no path just hiding  mary how tall is the mountain  matt high  laura do you know of a secret passageway to get up to it  matt only fools would try to scale a dragons mountain  laura yeah well were pretty stupid do you know of a path  matt he gives you a look of momentary indifference and kind of no  felicia i dont believe him i do not believe him  sam hes giving you sass  laura he is giving me sass  mary yes can we what do we roll to 
town	  sam while theyre talking im going to loot the other bodies  matt okay as you glance around the corpses you find not too much on them though it looks like  theyve gathered from raiding other people theyre passing on the road or just scavenging about you  find 274 gold  felicia vex can you do your detect dragon here  laura i can actually  felicia because im not quite there at a thousand feet but  laura i can most definitely detect the dragon so youre saying that we need to not be out in 
none	  the open because the dragon is attracted to things that are not hidden  mary yes  matt hungry it will take you but thats your choice  mary have you ever seen it up close  matt no  sam would you like to  laura you want to come with us  matt no  laura then stop giving us sass  matt you say youll keep me alive but you walk towards death one or the other way  i end up at the bottom  mary we talk towards glory  laura did you see 
none	 how fast we killed your friends were pretty amazing  matt then go go and see your dragon  mary do you know of any more information on this dragon thats all any weaknesses anything  matt he gives you a look like hes on empty hes given you everything hes gonna give you  travis well now youre on empty i take my greataxe and i chop off his head  all oh  taliesin guys  sam no wait stop  felicia now this is just not right  matt as the whole group gasps grog just shoves 
dung	 him back and whoosh whoom pff pff the head  rolls hits a patch of snow and stops the body falls back and you see kind of dark blood begin to  pour out of the rest of the body and into the snow  sam grog  travis what  sam you should have checked with our leader before you did that  laura yes most definitely  felicia okay i think were going to have to have a talk circle right now  mary okay before that do any of the orc have any iron on them at 
none	 all  matt looking around there are bits and pieces of whether it be iron weapons you can see  scavenged a few like some of the axes that were being used have an iron or similar type metal that  is crafted in those though its usually pretty beaten and not very well maintained  mary it doesnt matter i just want the iron whatever i can i  matt ill say you can harvest the iron blades from three axes  mary thank you  matt theyre in relatively poor condition but you can mark that  travis 
none	 sorry lyra  sam all right are we doing a talk circle  felicia i think we need to discuss the fact that that was just very inappropriate and i am here as  a leader and i think that that was just not right we are better than that  laura we are but heres the thing  sam you did kill one of them too though  felicia yes  mary lyra we are going to kill we are on our way to kill something  felicia well its we had a deal  laura well he probably 
none	 wouldve led his friends to us to kill us  felicia as a leader i choose not to pursue this any more but i will register my disapproval and  i think we should just proceed im very im very vexed  taliesin thats very fair thats very fair  felicia thank you  mary scanlan cant you sing a song to make her feel better  sam i could sing a song to make her feel better  mary but you dont want to  laura sings scanlan make you feel good  sam at least shes not talking 
none	 about aldor so im okay with it  felicia oh did you want to we havent talked yet  sam i we should go  taliesin you should write a song about aldor  travis i go over and i pick up the orcs head and i walk it over to lyra and i go here im sorry  you can keep this it wont happen without me asking again  felicia no thats quite all right its  travis no really look its still got stuff in it  matt as he shakes it you see spattering across the 
none	  felicia no okay thats quite i think we should just proceed we should proceed  everyone  laura im gonna try to see if theres a dragon within  taliesin and i say we could just cut out the tongue its not  travis just the tongue  taliesin like that yes yes  travis i rip the tongue out of the head  felicia thats a good idea vex  mary do we need the pelt of the dire wolf  travis i put the orc tongue in the bag of holding and the orc head both  
none	 mary just asking  matt all right  taliesin with the lip now we youre slowly  travis the lip is in my belt baby  mary and i would like to extract the canines from the dire wolf  matt from the dire wolf all right i would like you to go ahead and make a nature check  mary whats that  matt thats to attempt to harvest the creatures canines  laura whats that sorry  mary sorry what do i do  matt roll a d20 and add your nature check bonus  mary oh that 
none	 sucks  laura can i primeval awareness the dragon  mary 12  matt okay as you begin taking a small dagger out from the inside of your cloak of useful things you  break one of the tooths in the process unfortunately you manage to get one of  them at least so you do have one dire wolf canine you can add to your items  mary i would like to put my hands on the dire wolf and just thank it for no other reason than i  respect its life  matt very well  taliesin 
none	 i dont think hes going to answer  mary you know its not for you percy  taliesin oh well im just saying  laura the dragon then  taliesin im trying to be helpful  mary i understand  matt all right you take a moment and concentrate and for a six mile radius currently no dragon  laura still its still oh right its towards a mountain  sam weve got another days travel its got to be 20 miles away  travis should we keep sleeping or should we just pack it up now and go

none	  more than one search party  taliesin probably not  felicia probably not  taliesin im in my pyjamas im going back to bed  felicia i think thats a good call that i agree with as the leader of this group  taliesin what she said  mary are we always going to call it sleepytime  felicia i mean thats  mary im just asking i like to put labels on things its an ocd thing  felicia whatever you would like to call it or just yeah  mary no youre the leader i shall accept

none	 of the watches go without incident  in the morning you wake up and the cold air was pretty rough for a lot of you thankfully the fire  was there to help but youre you get the feeling that the further north you travel the  weathers going to become an issue even with the warm clothing you currently have on all right so  you guys step back to where your horses are currently  laura oh our horses are okay  travis oh shit we forgot about those  matt thankfully your horses were far enough away 
town	 from the area where you were the focus was not to  make any noise when they came upon you so the orcish party knew better than  to attack the horses first  laura oh thats good  matt the horses are still a little spooked from the evenings events but nevertheless you get  back on your horses you continue up the glasswalk road you had a question  mary i use beast speech to calm them tell them  everything shall be fine  travis you have just got all sorts of shit  mary everything will 
none	 be wonderful and thank you for leading us where we need to go we shall try  and make sure that no harm comes to you  matt and immediately with that the horses who were currently rattled and some of them are being  unresponsive to your attempts to mount them settle down come to a calm point and allow you  all to get atop them without an issue  travis being fully asleep i cast fart  laughter  matt all right  taliesin the irony is i was going to recommend dust of tracelessness but that 
none	 works too  laura oh that works too can you  taliesin they would never follow that so  matt dust of cloud of deterrence  taliesin cloud of deterrence thank you  mary what do you want to do my love dear whoever you are  laura oh yes dust of tracelessness hes got this stuff we can cover our tracks  travis should we sleep  felicia we slept already were on the horses  sam its the next day  travis oh it is  laura yeah  travis oh we ride  sam we ride

none	 keeping a goliath on its back for extensive riding  travis could i give it could i give it a health potion  matt lets just say its probably going to be a little swaybacked by the end of this adventure  laura oh poor thing  felicia poor little horsie  mary it may need to ride you  matt its okay for now  taliesin at some point you should give it a break with the carpet  laura yeah  travis i cant ride the carpet  sam we dont have the carpet  laura why did 
none	 we  sam do we have the carpet  travis we gave the carpet to them  laura the other team has the carpet those bastards  felicia i dont know them but thats very that is upsetting  travis yeah that is  matt you guys continue traveling for a second day  laura why because tiberius can fly why the hell did we give them the carpet  laughter  laura sorry  mary oh  sam its all right we dont need the crutch  laura all right  travis second day  sam were fine  
none	 mary day two  felicia and so anyway so when i first met aldor  sam uhhuh  felicia  he was hired to be my bodyguard and it was so obvious that he was so capable when he  walked in the room  sam how did he react when you first told him of your feelings  felicia i mean it was not a good evening but he was paid to be there so he couldnt leave so that  was well that was good for me  sam always works for me  felicia its not it 
none	 didnt work today but it could work tomorrow or the day after  travis oh my god can we make an agreement i kill you you kill me  mary yes  felicia and suddenly he disappears its so funny that  sam well you men are complicated  matt a few hours of a few hours of travel and  mary percy any extra guns  taliesin what  mary sorry  matt learning the ins and outs of the extremely tumultuous history of lyra and aldor you  eventually come to a point where the clouds are beginning 
town	 to darken and in the distance you can  see what looks like a very heavily obscured curtain of snowfall to the northnorthwest you  get to a point of the glasswalk road where a snowstorm is starting to pour over this vicinity  you guys stop for a second and repackage yourself with your fur and heavy winter clothing and even  still its very very chilly id like everybody to make a constitution save  laura are we still in the forest  matt you are nearing forest yes so yeah you would be considered in forest area 
none	  laura okay  travis arent i good like above 20000 feet in really really cold environments  matt yes you have advantage on this  laura natural 20 sorry that was my first one  felicia youre so warm  matt laughs so warm  laura its bad thing to roll a natural 20 on  taliesin were cuddling you for warmth apparently youre like an oven  laura its trinket you know  mary 15  matt all right  felicia 20  sam four  taliesin 24  sam hey that adds up  travis is this

none	 low blow  matt all right so all of you manage scanlan mark yourself you have one level of fatigue  laura and mary oh no  sam whats that mean whats that mean  matt fatigue let me go ahead and make sure  mary too much listening to oh sorry  felicia does he look cold im going to give him my stone im going to give him my stone of  resisting cold  travis that was bullshit percy  sam what about you  felicia its okay im a leader and a leader sacrifices  sam 
none	 i cant let you do that lyra  felicia no really just take it you listened to me so good its like were besties  sam i feel i feel a connection i do you know when you were telling me about aldor  felicia its not sexual at all  sam no i uh  felicia im not attracted to you at all like literally if it happened i would be ill but its  really nice  sam believe me you sexually you repulse me  felicia thank you  sam yeah no really  felicia oh my

town	 time we were together it was after i gave him armor but  he was not servicing me  sam wait together  felicia yes  sam youve been with him  felicia of course i told you  mary oh look we seem to be coming to something interesting in the road  felicia were you not listening  sam i thought you meant that as a metaphor  felicia no it was his birthday and i bought him some very expensive custom armor that he you  said he had it on which is he obviously has feelings 
none	 for me to wear that armor  it was 10000 gold  laura gasps  felicia  and he just he was very attracted to me that night and we had intercourse so my uncle  was very upset with me  travis intercourse  felicia and after that he never saw  sam somehow you made that less sexual than i couldve ever imagined is there grog whats  the term for when your penis is inverted the opposite of a boner  travis belly button  sam yeah thats what ive got now  felicia anyway i was 
none	 really certain after that moment that we would be together forever and i  never saw him again  sam you know men are fickle and when i ill have a talk with him  felicia he kept the armor so he has feelings lets just move on  sam lets do it  felicia heres the stone  sam lets not dwell  matt you take the stone and your fatigue fades you find yourself adjusting well to the cold  climate thanks to your gift from your new leader and  sam i love her  mary leaderslashlover 
town	  matt all right so as you guys pull off the side of the road and use the cover of the forest to  help from the snow thats beginning to hit even harder you gather there is in this vicinity an  ever waxingandwaning blizzard that pours through you can see a localized area that is not  really moving you wait like a good 20 30 minutes to see if theres any movement but the blizzard is  not shifting from its location  felicia should we try to do the spell locate dragon again just to make 
none	 sure  its at the top of this  sam good leading good leading  laura sure i will try it again  matt all right you sit and concentrate for a moment and nothing nothing wait you sense  this very very small blip at the edge its moving quickly  laura there theres a dragon  felicia where is it which which  laura its fast wait  sam which way east north south  matt its getting closer you can sense its energy up in the air  laura its up in the air  matt at 
none	 that point you hear this distant guttural howl just a  laura we should hide just in case how about we hide  matt raaah comes bursting out over the air the wind begins to pick up and the snowfall begins  to become ice the rest of you guys have to kind of duck yourself out of the way  laura no way  matt  everyone make a reflex or sorry a dexterity saving throw  mary whats that  felicia i am very good at that  sam i dont even know what this is what is 
none	 this  felicia thats a nine  mary12  travis eight  sam 13  felicia 11  taliesin 16  laura 24  matt all right all of you guys manage to find cover under the nearest tree where the bough of  the forest is at its strongest you avoid most of the brunt impact grog unfortunately takes a good  portion of slamming icestone damage negligible for most damage youre used to but you still take  four points of bludgeoning damage from the falling ice  travis all right  matt the sleet as you guys 
none	 are currently in this position you can see barely through the very very  heavy snowfall a shape that whoo moves over in the distance that circles around and then heads  back in a western direction  sam can we get its attention  mary i cast beast speak and say where do you live im kidding  travis i was like really  taliesin thank you for that addendum because we  laura and mary not really  mary not really  laura all of us are like ahh  mary i have a sick sense of humor 
town	  laura can i see which direction its going back towards the mountain  matt yeah you look over in that direction and you can barely make it through bits as the storm  intensifies and begins to subside a little bit you can see what looks to be the gentle outline of  a mountain range maybe about ten miles off from the road to the west of the road  into the forest itself  laura great  sam weve got this  laura we got to go in the forest  felicia okay lets go  mary 
none	 it should provide us with some cover from the snow as well  sam but who knows what lurks in those woods  mary this is true  laura well i can also you know see what kind of creatures are around  sam all right  mary oh yes  laura no i cant i cant see animals just kidding  felicia well we dont really have a choice we have to get the dragon  sam lets plunge in  felicia and we have a time limit  travis youre the team leader  felicia we have we 
none	 need now theres really no other way to go  we have to go through the forest  matt currently  felicia currently  matt unless you guys have any other plan right now there is about ten miles of forest between  you near the roadway and this mountain range where apparently the dragon has returned to  felicia great okay well theres nothing else to be done we just have to go as fast as we can  laura all right  mary i could cast invisibility and fly i could fly us all somewhere  felicia i 
none	 dont really have any other  laura oh you cant fly all of us can you  mary i think i can fly up to nine i thought  laura you can fly up to nine people  sam what  laura tiberius can only fly up to three people  sam what kind of devil are you  felicia oh should we fly we  sam wait can you fly  felicia i cant fly no but maybe zahra can fly  laura if were flying though im just going to put this out there theres nowhere to hide 
none	 if the  dragon comes back out  mary i understand but i can also cast invisibility  laura well thats awesome  felicia but that doesnt last as long or  mary i can target one additional creature for each slot above third what does that mean  matt it means if everything you cast is at maximum level it would be fifth level which  means you could target three creatures with invisibility  mary three creatures with invisibility and three creatures with fly  laura but is it at the same time or is it a concentration 
none	  matt its a concentration either way i will say as soon as you start thinking about flying and  getting there you look up past where the trees are flying in this weather  would be a terrible idea  felicia thats a terrible idea  mary all right  felicia you know what i was thinking it might not be good it might not be good lets just  ride we have the horses we cant leave the horses behind we only have  travis right okay we start riding  sam we could we just rented them 
none	 50 bucks so  felicia dont remind me of that that was just a thing all right onward lets  travis im still in the back doing the dust of uhhh  felicia yay go  matt dust of uhhh  travis naynay  mary we ride  matt as the flower girl picks up the back end you guys trudge on horseback into the heart of  this section of the vesper timberlands it is a very dense forest and you find that any  straightroad path is not going to function as youre constantly having to weave in 
none	 and out from  the thick tree trunks and heavy foliage that has taken over the floor plus a layer of snow that  tends to encapsulate the area your movement is relatively restrained than this pace youre  normally used to going you have what bonuses do you have because of the forest terrain  laura i have  matt to the groups movement if any  laura yes movement is fine for all of the group  matt thankfully though you have vex guiding you on this path and where it would be a very  difficult experience 
none	 pushing through this forest especially with the time limit you have she is  able to find the quickest paths to dodge any of the heavy areas that are dense  with dangerous snowfall  laura i would also like to perception ahead and make sure that nothing is going to  sneak attack us again  matt understood understood  felicia very good call  matt all right in that regard i would like you to go ahead and make a perception check  sam oh boy something out there nope  laura that is lower than my passive 
none	 perception though which is 21  sam your passive perception  laura  is 21  matt right  sam wow  laura and plus five no thats it just 21 but its a 12 for right now  matt its a 12 okay you keep an eye out as you continue to move forward  laura oh but i get to roll twice though because its my favored terrain  matt thats true you do advantage on that  laura okay shut up  sam when the cameraman laughs  mary when the cameraman is laughing at you you 
none	 know its a good roll  laura its no thats not that bad its 15  matt thats an improvement  laura its a slight improvement  felicia better than 12  laura thats right  matt 15 is indeed  matt and taliesin  better than 12  matt the things you learn watching critical role ladies and gentlemen  sam sings the more you know  travis learning  matt so in following vex through the forest weaving back and forth about an hour of travel in  you i know you gotta get going soon how soon 
none	 do you have to go  laura were calling a car and its however soon it gets here  matt all right pushing forward you eventually manage to avoid what looks like a long frozen lake  in the center of the forest with a series of heavily icedover stone ruins  laura dont walk on this lake  felicia oh good call good call  matt you move around and in the distance you swear you see the glimmer of some glowing entity  in the midst of these ruins and you manage to keep enough of a distance 
none	 everyone make a stealth  check on this so roll a d20 and add your stealth bonus  felicia add it or take away because its negative  matt for you itd be taking away from your stealth roll  felicia great thats great  sam clangclangclang  felicia 11  mary 13  matt 13  sam 13  laura 16  matt grog stealth  travis stealth is 14  sam 13  taliesin 24  felicia 11  matt all right so though clumsy in form the group is able to pull you far enough away where 
none	  they cover your bases on this and this glowing entity doesnt seem to take notice of your passage  as it slowly fades into the stone ruins once again you press on towards the mountain  sam should we go check that glowing entity out  mary what was it  felicia do i oh do i know i have an arcana or would it be nature or  matt for this i would say go ahead and make a religion check actually  felicia oh good three i dont know its 11  matt its spooky and you 
none	 dont like it  felicia i dont like that so lets keep going  laura we should avoid it  sam okay if you insist  matt pushing forward about another hour and a half two hours you eventually make it through the  forest dodging a few other areas where clustered vines and almost thick brambles begin to close off  portions of the passage without vexs help on this it would be a very difficult element to  traverse but you manage to find areas you can cut through and where the weak points of these  various 
none	 interwoven nets of vinework are you push through until the forest comes to an end at the  base of a giant treecovered mountain that is currently coated in snow and ice looking about  you can see that the highest spire is obscured by the very blizzard clouds ahead there is heavy  snowfall in this vicinity and your vision is semiobscured past a certain area only because of  vexs keen sight are you able to make out the details of that mountain  disappearing into the blizzard  travis this is very much like home for me 
none	  laura do we see any anything along the bottom the edge of the mountain that looks like it could  open into a cavern of some sort  matt there are a number of large rocks and boulders that seem to have tumbled off the  mountain and embedded themselves in the ground in sections you do see what looks to be a cavern of  some kind that is in the at the base of this mountain its about 20 25 feet high and about 35  feet wide  mary should we maybe go in  felicia 
none	 does it look like we can climb the mountain or is it just too sheer  matt go ahead and make a perception check  felicia oh good this is my best oh nope its a nine  laughter  matt you youve read about mountains  laughter  matt and youve seen many pictures of them seeing one up close theyre a lot bigger than you  thought theyd be  felicia very large mountain guys im not sure as a leader id like to invite you guys to  evaluate whether we could possibly climb this mountain  
none	 taliesin i would like to evaluate whether or not we could climb this mountain  sam youre delegating thats good  laura yeah delegate  travis so im proficient here right  laura can we check  matt you id say for this and since you know mountain ranges pretty well go ahead and make a  wisdom check on this yeah  travis shit  matt just add your wisdom modifier to the roll  travis which is zero laughs 15  matt 15 as youre kinda taking a moment to inspect it you your people your actual race 
none	  being mountainborn people you look at it and it could be scaled it would be a dangerous climb and  you would need some semblance of simple climbing tools to do so  travis so we got to make it come to us  felicia well  mary we could  laura oh thats smart grog thats really smart  felicia we have to lure the dragon down  sam or one of us could climb it and  travis jump off  sam  bring it down as bait i could do that  felicia i dont think 
none	 that sounds like a good idea theres a cavern over there should we  inspect it maybe theres some inner workings to get to the top  taliesin i think this conversation would be greatly improved by some sort of cover  laura well get into cover maybe just to be safe  mary i agree i vote on going to investigate the cavern  felicia lets go to the cavern well its not a democracy but thats okay i am totally open  mary and i agree with your  matt you hear this heavy sound of wind rushing 
dung	 suddenly  felicia oh god get in the cavern get in the cavern get in the cavern  taliesin cavern now  matt lets see oof okay laughs vex on horseback you look over and the snow thats  hitting your face you see a dark shape begin to form in the snow it gets larger and larger and  larger and you realize its not something thats swelling or growing its something thats coming  at you very fast and its very large you immediately try and turn your horse around but  its too fast and it slams 
none	 into the side of you sending you off the horse and tumbling to the  ground you feel a heated pain in your side you havent felt in a long time from the impact  laura ah what  matt you guys watch as a boulder about that big of rock and ice  sam oh shit  matt  just smacks into the side of you  sam oh shit  laura youre kidding me right that sucked  mary where did it come from  sam it was just a random meteor  matt you take 30 points 
none	 of bludgeoning damage  laura youre kidding me  felicia what the  mary wow  matt and youre knocked onto the ground  felicia oh my god vex screams  matt the rest of you who are currently on horseback see this and from the direction of the  forest you see a large very large humanoid figure begin to step out of the edge of the forest  laura its a giant oh no  matt this low voice kind of bellows out you can see on it thick snowcovered  fur patchwork hide armor the skin itself 
none	 is a dull bluishgrey in color white eyes a giant  metallic horn what looks like some sort of creatures horns that are affixed to the sides of  its helmet a giant axe in its hand this is indeed and you recognize it immediately this  is a frost giant you see it reach down and grab another boulder and begin to toss it in its  hand as the rest of you see this you hear another bellow  laura you speak giant you speak giant right  matt does anyone speak giant here  travis i do 
none	  matt you hear a voice come echoing from the cavern behind you saying intruder  take him down  laura oh no no no  sam what do we do guys  mary talk to him for  matt a second frost giant steps out of the cavern behind you  laura shit  matt and thats where were going to go ahead and end the session for today  yelling  sam were in between two giants and a dragon  felicia without  mary hagawaga hawafenor  laura im damaged  felicia very damaged  mary shes

none	  well they have a whole slew of that so those would be your best bets  marisha theyre like miniature grab bags  matt apparently oh what all right matt can read on air and then i can read that off the air  thats the private conversation here we go this is filled with money no its not its my  favorite fan  mary its a check  matt i want to take a moment to say i appreciate that most of our letters we get are handwritten  and that is such a rarity these days 
none	 and it kinda makes this little archaic happiness in my heart  sprout so matt so far from my experience dms typically have a ton of dice so i thought why not  make a little bug to help with the struggle bag bag to help with the struggle oh read that  bug im also bad at writing hand reading handwriting i love handwritten letters im just  terrible at them i apologize  marisha i got really excited i thought it was gonna be like a dice bug  matt right or just like a whole bunch of
