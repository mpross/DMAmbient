none	 marisha laughs man i dont know why we keep trying really hard  matt well keep trying well make it work  marisha were trying so hard man to make this work  matt i know  marisha trying so hard all right guys this is going to be our last attempt so if this fails  just know that we love you and we tried  matt and wish you a very happy thanksgiving  marisha and we wish you a happy thanksgiving  matt if this fails it falls through  marisha yeah service is quite spotty and 
dung	 were slowly leaving civilization even more as we speak  matt we keep starting when we get to cities and then pushing into dark areas with no lights  marisha and we lose signal but yes happy thanksgiving and we cant wait its weird that  tomorrows thursday and theres no game  matt i know especially where we left it off ugh  marisha its become so ingrained into our system although in a weird way its almost like this  week time has been different i feel like normally the weeks feel so long getting to  thursday 
none	 but now i think because i was anticipating it being a twoweek break i feel  like this is more of a this feels like a halfway point i dont know its weird to describe but  yes  matt i concur  marisha you concur  matt yes  marisha its good its weird we miss it yeah i think they are doing a rebroadcast tomorrow  actually so if you guys want to catch up on critical role or have nothing better to do or  does football still happen on thanksgiving day  matt im not the 
none	 person to ask this  marisha if you dont want to watch football you can watch critical role which would be kind of  a what  matt im sorry i have to enjoy the fact that you turned to me to ask me a football question  thats delightful  marisha well i dont know never mind three games yes theres a lot of football happening  tomorrow theres always football  matt you guys can go play your footsballs and your outdoor things  marisha how about that comic this week you guys how about that comic that 
none	 came out today am i  right  matt i need to read it i havent  marisha i am so in love with it im not going to lie out of all the ones that taliesin and i have  written for this arc that are coming up this one i was the most excited for and she did not  disappoint this is definitely one of my favorite ones that we came up with and she did a really  good job on it i was happy with it  matt you should be youre good at writing 
none	  marisha i was happy with it i know i know that the comic is really short but we are making do  with the budget that we got so that is what we were able to get approved in advance  matt that time that the artists have to work on it too for that much turn around  marisha the time and  matt if this goes well wed like to do more with it and actually produce i mean pie in the sky  id love to be able to put together an actual comic based on 
none	 previous exploits of vox machina  and stuff thatd be a really fun thing but its also one of those things that is timeconsuming  and expensive  marisha thats why weve been pushing people so hard to go look at it because as long as people go  look at the comic we can possibly get more comic yeah the reason why its so short is because  thats what weve got to work with right now yeah for the people who are asking go to  geekandsundrycom and we now have a weekly critical rolevox machina comic strip 
none	 definitely  go check it out  matt theyre bite size four panels each week  marisha yeah a comic strip like family ties or marmaduke  matt family ties  marisha wait what did i say family circus is what i meant  matt family ties was the best comic strip ive ever seen i dont know about you guys the  crossover with the avengers was pretty intense too good to see michael j fox in fighting form  marisha laughs yeah exactly  matt im glad were maintaining signal this is nuts  marisha people are saying 
none	 someone said you voiced chrom in fire emblem  matt fire emblem awakening yes  marisha they said i thought that was crispin  matt no crispin voices all the other cooler characters  marisha yeah crispins everyone else but hes chrom  matt thank you for being the wind at my back and the sword at my side  marisha aw i have a bird sitter for dagon dont worry dagons one not in the car and two not  abandoned or left alone  matt yeah no dagon doesnt do well with driving at all  marisha dagon 
none	 gets carsick  matt i know i didnt know birds could do that  marisha yeah birds get carsick i dont know if you guys know that but birds get carsick  matt she starts hyperventilating she starts throwing up and were like no  marisha you wouldnt think but birds get carsick their little equilibrium in their brain  they do not like the driving it gets weird for them its interesting  matt we have to put her in a little box and cover her up when we take her to the vet  marisha we have to 
dung	 make it dark and i have to be a shock system and be like dont look outside  people who get sea sickness its kind of like that dont look at the horizon youll know  youre driving and then youll get sick  matt oh ive had a few questions about this i wanted to alert you guys to i mentioned the  updates to the witch hunter class im working on those a lot of adjustments inspiration a lot  of it stemmed from the fact that the character class was sort of inspired through the preparation  
none	 for the vin diesel game but i had to tailor it to what little information i had on his character  the title witch hunter was to tie into the movie but it was also a misnomer as the class  didnt really have much to do with witches that was just one of its quarries some of the  abilities were created based on what little information i had about the trailers of the film  once that film that whole promo event left i wanted to recreate the class in a way that was  wholly my own 
none	 and wasnt quite so directly affiliated to that film and that whole event i  changed the name currently going with the theme of calling it a blood hunter the idea being that  its essentially a warrior or a martial class that is so intune with its own physical vitality its  life force that it sacrifices and utilizes it its blood rite is now called the crimson rite it gets  blood curses which you can gain more as it levels up and those allow it to curse and manipulate  enemies psychologies in small ways as well 
none	 as their own imagine a martial class blood magus if  you will so instead of being all magicbased its about enhancing and altering martial  prowess and small manipulations of the enemy the blood hunter im calling it should have some  updates coming soon im getting some great notes back im actually getting some notes back from  some folks at wizards about it that way when i put it out i can have it pretty wellbalanced  based on community feedback and official company feedback and i can feel a little more comfortable  about throwing out 
none	 in the ether to be torn apart by the sharks hopefully ill have that for you  guys soon in some way shape or form its been a lot of fun to  marisha yeah retool  matt homebrew man its a process  marisha yeah he was saying blood hunter by the way for anyone blood hunter not void  hunter or demon hunter blood hunter  matt blood hunter as the essence of their capabilities are through forbidden blood magic and  the ability to sacrifice their own vitality or manipulate their own vitality to enhance their  
dung	 abilities the blood is the very central theme to a lot of their capabilities and magical prowess as  part of their martial enhancement thats the theme other than that there are still creature  hunters theyre still very much against demons fey dark fey against ghosts and undead and stuff  like that those things still align there but the core of that class is now based around  manipulation of its own vitality there you go  marisha word i wasnt looking at questions because i was trying to get good camera angles of  your face  
none	 matt thats an impossible attempt  marisha thats not true  matt i appreciate your candor  marisha someone else had a good question right before and i was like ooh thats a good  question im going to have to remember that one and then i forgot about it  matt oh no no  marisha i dont know  matt whoever it was if you had a good question ask it again  marisha if you had a good question just ask it again person who had a good question  matt marishas filtering the chat so im 
none	 able to drive  marisha yeah ooh thats actually a good question advice for making a tiefling cleric  matt ooh theres some great domains there theres the trickery domain theres the war  domain and it depends on the theme of if you want to truly embrace your demonic heritage or if  you shun it entirely and your pious development as a character is more to try and make recompense for  what you deem yourself as a cursed bloodline  marisha generally really theres no wrong answers  matt no  marisha people need to just know 
none	 that when building a character theres no wrong answers as  long as youre able to justify it  matt yeah find a cool story aspect a nice hook and a reason for why you built a character the way  you did no matter how weird they are people complain that multiclassing isnt as powerful in  the long run as sticking to a single class from a numbers standpoint maybe to a negligible degree  really but its all about whats making whats interesting to you to play in a game if you have  a campaign thats 
dung	 in the minmaxing dungeon crawl make something that works in that degree  marisha i really like what taliesin had to say about it in his interview that he did the written  interviews that we did on geek  sundry he said his method for making characters is he always  tries to make someone hed want to hang out with because especially if youre starting a  longrunning campaign you are going to be with this person for a very long time so make someone  youd want to hang out with i think thats a really good 
none	 tip  matt you could make a punk or an asshole to a degree as long as there are some redeeming  quality to them  marisha oh i have a lot of friends who are assholes  matt because the rest of your party has to hang out with you for that time as well  marisha right  matt unless you all agree that you want to make a party of terrible people and do a shortrun evil  campaign maybe  marisha scanlan is kind of a scummy douchebag but  matt a loveable scummy douchebag  
tavern	 marisha hes a loveable scummy douchebag  matt i have many friends that fall in that same category that i shake my head at them quite  often but more often than not you know theres a good core there theres a good person they just  have very curious methods  marisha yeah everyone has their vices  matt mind you i dont have any friends who crapped on beds or anything that i know of  marisha that you know of  matt that i know of  marisha that you know of totally yeah druid second place 
none	 druid second place to who nobody  thats what i say  matt oh snap  marisha what what those are fighting words once again guys i apologize if we lose service were  driving in the desert im looking at my phone for service so if we lose service here soon happy  thanksgiving and we love you guys so much and well be back soonish whats the deal for this  months critmas its happening on not this next episode but the episode after  matt the first thursday of the month we were going to try to 
none	 do  marisha but were pushing it this week because first thursday of the month is next thursday  matt right not this one not next one yeah so itd be two were pushing it back to the second  week this month because we cant do the thursday before critmas  marisha christmas  matt were not playing christmas eve and then we cant do the week before because thats also the  opening night of star wars and pretty much the entire crew as well as most everyone we know will  be out that night to see 
none	 that so were going to play were going to end as close to 1000 as we  can and then let everyone go early so were going to be doing our critmas a week later than we  normally would be so itll be the second thursday of december is the current plan  marisha be looking out for the website because im going to be putting out a critters guide for  critmas here very soon so yes to help guide people because weve gotten a lot of questions on  what to do and what to get one 
none	 of the things thats going to be talked about a lot in there is  all of the charities that we all really like supporting because as much as we like stuff we  really like it when people give to other charities especially give to people in our name  people have been doing that more and more and we really like that  matt its a strange thing because on one hand its a really wonderful thing that you guys share  with us your passion and your interest by sending things which we never expected asked for 
none	 or  thought would happen its a really cool experience at the same time its also very  strange to be receiving so many gifts to an extent because were just people we would like to  redirect some of that positivity towards great causes and stuff as opposed to having to buy a  lot of things necessarily crafts and things you want to make music or art all of that stuff is  fantastic another great avenue that we really appreciate is giving to charities and supporting  like the animal rescue charities are great the person that 
none	 adopted that bear for laura was great  marisha someone adopted a bear and then we recently we havent talked about it onstream  yet but we got somebody who donated a bunch of seeds in our name bought seeds for farmers its  a charity a nonprofit organization that buys seeds and crops for farmers who might have lost  their crops for the year due to drought or plant disease or extreme weather or anything that can  happen to these poor farmers that can completely ruin their year if they lose their entire crop so  this 
none	 is an organization that will donate fresh crops and fresh seeds to farmers who might have  lost their crops coming from a farming family  matt and a druid  marisha and a druid that definitely speaks to me because i know how much that sucks and i know what  its like when your family  matt due to blight  marisha loses yes due to blight exactly its awful when you lose your crops due to blight  and the poor farmers in our country poor farmers everywhere are not appreciated enough  matt think of whitestone 
none	  marisha look at whitestone yeah especially considering that farmers keep us alive so farmers  are awesome stuff like that is a great cause to donate to that we always appreciate oh thats  awesome tuk said theres somebody a local charity that buys christmas trees for families  correct me if im wrong on that the chat just went really fast  matt thats really cool  marisha thats really rad yeah i like that weve really enjoyed giving back to 826 and all that  stuff has been so rewarding all the extra life campaign going and 
none	 visiting the childrens  hospital is amazing its been so great to actually give back in a way that you sometimes  feel like you dont necessarily have the power to all the time in your day to day life so this  matt we all empower each other thats what so crazy about this community everyone supports each  other to such an amazing degree were just a channel for some of that positivity  marisha thats what it was thats what the person was saying earlier the really good  question that i remembered oh god kit buss 
none	 and rat queens because that is public because someone  brought that up in the announcements speaking of this whole crazy escapade doing amazing things for  people yeah kit got contacted by kurtis wiebe who is the writer and creator of rat queens whom  i know you guys have laura and all the rest of us talk about it on the show all the time kit is  actually going to be doing the art for a rat queens webcomic which is fucking awesome and  amazing yeah im so glad because shes earned it beyond earned it 
none	  matt its so cool when good people get together and get to do good things  marisha and all because of critical role its crazy because of our dumb dd game  matt because of her amazing talent but  marisha that connection happened because  matt its become this weird hub for a lot of things that are really cool  marisha yeah its awesome yay for kits fake accent i know maybe one day shell learn how to  do a proper british accent like liam maybe or you yeah  matt no pressure having a real 
none	 brit all of a sudden play dd with you and all of your  fakeaccented characters  marisha and then she comes on and busts out a russian accent what shes fucking awesome  lets see what else do we have questions liam does the best grog people doing their grog  impressions has become a new thing its become a new thing yeah oh no it looks maybe
