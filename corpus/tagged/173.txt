none	  fire burning  matt and welcome back good job liam  liam its the only thing im here for  matt so last we left off the mighty nein after being pulled through a series of pirate adjacent  and straight up pirate adventures across the swavain islands here in the lucidian ocean on the  ship the squalleater under the captain avanticas rule you made your way to darktow  where you attempted to find a way to discredit her find a way to not be dragged into her  business in the future it got a little 
none	 messy but you managed to avoid it coming to too terrible a  head until you are brought into her ship last week where a battle unfolded in which most of you  managed to skitter away with the contents of this journal that you had taken from her as well as the  translation for the cipher that was used to write it managed to make your way to the plank king in  time and have him bring his resources to the docks before any more of you could be further destroyed  summoning a demon helped as 
none	 part of the distraction as well as patiently waiting some  quick thought process moments you guys did pretty damn well you managed to just break enough laws  to be put not in favor of the plank king but managed to have done a large favor enough to be  let leave and never return taking the hobbled ship that you guys had busted with you you made  your way out into the open ocean heading northeast from darktow and the dragshallow reef  in search of the possible shipwreck that started fjords destiny in the direction of 
none	 ukotoa after  days of travel and a few location spells cast you managed to find a blip at the base of the sea  using your newfound ability to instill the ability to breathe water within the party around you you  sunk to the bottom holding onto cannonballs and began to walk the bottom floor in search of the  shipwreck eventually coming upon a valley caldera that slowly sinks down you noticed aside from  the whale that just skimmed your presence the bow of a derelict wrecked ship sitting there  surrounded by seaweed in the 
none	 barelyvisible creeping daylight making it this deep in the  waters so with your lights aglow and the wreck before you mighty nein what do you want to do  travis i saw it thats all i needed we can head back up now  sam good  travis no were doing this thing nott were pushing through  sam were doing what no  travis yeah  laura so were searching for the orb  travis well i mean thatd be great if we could find that  marisha do you have any idea of where it might be 
none	  travis no  marisha all right  travis no  laura is there anything else we should look for fjord  travis lets see whats down there in general hope it goes without saying if you find any  remains lets be respectful  taliesin of course  laura do you have a pair of jammies or something that you lost in the boat that you want us to look  for your bedroom or something in there no  travis no  laura okay  travis do we see any other sea life  matt well get to 
none	 that because there was a note left here on my table that i almost forgot because  the game has started this was written and left behind by logic as he passed through earlier it  says flip over and read as soon as the game starts  marisha oh no  matt you sir matt are the sexiest being in all of neverland sincerely your boo logic  laughter  matt thats very sweet  marisha its canon  matt thank you buddy  travis thank god its not heres an astral dreadnought  matt yeah i know loading 
none	 the gun against you guys for the game tonight itd be pretty funny  liam does that mean that logic was the whale that just passed us by  matt there you go  marisha oh my god  laura we still have pass without a trace up i just cast it because of that whale  travis oh thats right  marisha hey caduceus  taliesin yeah  marisha you feeling any creepy spooky dead people or crawlies  matt make a perception check  travis oh right  taliesin thats actually a good idea im also going to 
none	  matt with disadvantage because theres no light here and its a very short range id say  because you guys extinguished all your lights when the  travis thats a natural one  laura ooh starting out right woo  taliesin perception checks  matt if you want to  taliesin also im going to cast eyes of the grave im going to do this a couple times  sam eyes of the grave  taliesin eyes of the grave thats perception of 22  matt with disadvantage  taliesin oh with disadvantage  matt because you do not 
dung	 have darkvision and its very dark under here and the distance is very  short you dont have any lights up  laura we did have lights up  matt you extinguished them when the whale came by you can put the lights back on if you want  taliesin oh okay i thought we had put them back up  travis i have darkvision  matt thats true you do have darkvision  travis the first one was a five so six  matt okay there you go six  taliesin 12  matt 12 okay  taliesin with 
none	 eyes of the grave  matt got you eyes of the grave you dont sense anything gathering your attention as you attempt  to reach out your essence to feel for any undead presence nothing but the very cold waters here  beneath still keep you a bit chilled it is very cold down here looking around best you can with  the lack of light aside from the swaying bits of seaweed that are all fluttering up and slowly  swaying reaching up hundreds and hundreds of feet before the darkness takes them you see the bow of  
none	 that wrecked ship not much else catches your attention  marisha fjord what was the name of the ship again  travis raspberry  sam you know the ship that started your whole backstory  matt its the tides breadth  travis the tides breadth  laughter  sam your origin story  taliesin yeah the sheet of paper you turned in nine months ago  travis i dont think i named it in my backstory the tides breadth yes  liam i am going to summon frumpkin to my shoulder and look through frumpkins eyes because frumpkin  as 
none	 an octopus has darkvision so i will see that way  matt perception check with frumpkin  liam oh not so good thats his just a seven  matt still a shipwreck there is a shipwreck ahead of you guys  laura when we step does it make a powder go up because its like poof on the ocean floor  matt as you do step across the surface of the sea floor there are bits of the silt and sediment  that clouds around your foot with each footfall  laura this is all fish poop spits see that 
none	 nott  sam no no thanks ugh  laura should we go  taliesin im perfectly happy to head towards this  travis lets go for it  marisha you said we had pass without a trace  sam im going to try to drink underwater  travis like a seal  matt okay  sam going to attempt to drink alcohol underwater  matt yes so you take and you tip it back the thing is in order for the liquid to leave the  vessel you have to send air to occupy the space theres a transition there 
none	 but youre breathing  water so it will mix water with whatevers in there  laura its salt water too  sam oh shit  laura youre going to get the poops if you do it  marisha super dehydrating  sam ill try to coax it out blowing  matt i mean youre not having to siphon it like gasoline as soon as you open it it begins to  diffuse into the nearby sea its very briny alcohol  sam gets the job done  matt this darkened cloud is filling around notts face  laura is this 
none	 where dashilla is or is she at a different place  travis per the song i mean  marisha it said that she was in this divers grave general location so maybe shes not here  laura oh so there could be something really scary in here  travis i mean what are the chances the oceans huge  laura the chances are really good fjord theyre really good  marisha yeah do you have our luck youve seen it  travis glass half empty i get it its all right  marisha apparently she has a hungry eye  
none	 laura laughter  travis got eyes right now all right well push forward  matt you guys begin to approach stepping carefully towards the base of this the ship  where its sitting its resting at an odd angle the front of it the bow slightly angled upward  you can see the side where this large explosion tore through the hull already for as long as  its been there which has not been but a year maybe tops you can see the rust and the  barnacles beginning to gather and claim the shipwreck to join but thats 
none	 best you can make  out with the lack of light down here  travis should we stick together or do we want to fan out and go around  liam i could send frumpkin in ahead of us to have a look around if you think thats wise  travis sure yeah thatd be fine  marisha thats funny  liam yes it is  marisha sorry  travis as we get closer can we see from outside the ship the extent of the damage from the initial explosion  matt youd probably have to go around a little 
none	 bit but yeah you walk around the opposite side  of it looking in you can see theres some damage you can see there are holes blown out on  the side that you were facing as you curve around you can see where theres a large gaping  hole in the side of the cargo hold  marisha fjord i know weve heard the story probably a dozen times but can you refresh us on  what happened the day this ship sank  travis yeah no i chased sabian down into the hold of the ship and he 
none	 was messing with a  package i saw a fuse burning as i chased him back up above deck there was an explosion and it  threw me from the ship its nice to know that it wasnt a small explosion a real motherfucker of a  thing apparently  sam were you being pursued by anyone  travis no we were in a storm he wasnt supposed to go below decks either that wasnt normally  his thing so it was strange when he went down there i saw him when i confronted him he threw  a dagger 
none	 into my chest  marisha what  travis yeah well he turned on me real fast he seemed to know that what he was doing wasnt up to  snuff when i chased him above he was at the bow of the ship getting ready to exit or jump off  obviously he knew what was coming next then the explosion went and the last thing i saw was the  ship as i was being thrown off  marisha so you all were doublecrossed clearly  travis yeah i dont know why though i didnt see anybody  marisha 
none	 onward i guess  laura he made it off safely  travis i dont know i assume  matt you did hear tale of him passing through nicodranas not too long ago  marisha sabian is the same person as vandren  travis no sabian was someone i grew up with who was also brought by vandren to work on the ship  yeah ive known him for many many years and hes always been a piece of shit of one variety or  another only in the most recent years did i think that maybe that stuff had faded 
none	 between us and  wed found a way to work together but apparently not  matt as you guys have gotten closer to around the side of the ship where the most extensive damage  was taken you can see where the top of the deck and the edges are blackened from a fire that broke  out probably during or shortly after the explosion but before it sank fully the edges of  the cargo hold that are blown open as soon as you begin to peer in the inside you can see the  interior is blackened as 
none	 well amongst the other patches of sea life that have begun to reclaim it  as a home and bits of seaweed and general sea vegetation that has begun to find its way inside  the empty ship  travis ooh as an idea sword in my hand as we start to push in through that hole of the  explosion or peer in can i lead with the sword and see if the light andor eye is reacting in any  sort of way or is it just static  matt make a perception check  travis not my 
none	 best nine  marisha nein  matt nein as you begin to swim into the darkened interior holding the sword in front of  you it doesnt seem to react adjust or give you any sense that it is able to guide you in any  particular direction  travis in the sea certain creatures like to make homes of vessels you want to send in your  liam ja thats no problem i give a little tug to the leather tied at my knee and cast mage  armor i send frumpkin in and reach for nott and hold 
none	 nott by the shoulder look through frumpkins  eyes and send him in to look  matt okay frumpkins octopus form makes his way into the cargo hold of the tides breadth  wreckage go ahead and roll a perception check for frumpkin and take a look around  liam terrible just terrible five  matt unfortunately theres so little light down here even for the darkvision theres the basic  outline of the interior hold frumpkin can notice the outline of pieces of broken crates and other  elements that may have once been stored within the ship but 
none	 very little detail is visible  liam fjord do you think it is safe to send in some light with him  travis yeah  liam tap me on the shoulder if you hear me because i cannot hear you  travis oh  taliesin quick point of order whos got the node we should probably decide now  laura oh i have the node  taliesin who was the last to node are you noded  laura i can node but somebody else could node  travis why dont you node  taliesin you node  liam gutturally node 
none	  laura will water get in the bag if i look in  taliesin i assume we would have done it i was just playing flashback but i dont know  matt well if you havent yet then youll be doing it now  laura is it okay to do that  matt one way to find out  sam that sounds crazy  liam my spell books are in there so please i cant hear anything  taliesin that was more of a point of order  liam i am bowling ball sending one globule of light in after 
none	 frumpkin to go with him  matt okay it emanates and lights up the immediate vicinity the balls dont give off a lot  of light theyre not torchlight in comparison they work in conjunction to create a larger space  of light but it does help a little bit with that benefit looking in the space you can see there  are no bodies there are no signs of any individuals who were on this ship but you also  know from your experience on the sea that those who die at sea usually float to the surface  
none	 travis and drift  matt yes you do see some metallic materials that have grown rusted you can see the shattered  crates that i mentioned before a lot of them are burned and destroyed as frumpkin drifts past one  of them you look inside there may have been some metal bars or some sort of a constructiontype  iron material but its mostly melted and fused together in fact as frumpkin makes his way  around all the elements of metal that were immediately in the vicinity it looks like there  was a cannon there were some 
dung	 other bits of all you can make out is debris at this point but  other things that were metallic in nature that have since bowed and fused from the heat of the  explosion and the fire than ensued thereafter before it sank  liam its mucky and dark in there we would have to take a closer look i cannot make out much  travis if you dont mind i know this ship better than anybody jester would you come up with me  and we can explore the captains quarters might be a good place to start 
none	  laura of course  taliesin do you need a light  travis no im okay  taliesin all right  travis ill drop the cannonball and i will push up off the ground supermanstyle in the water  and swim up above the deck  laura i guess ill let this okay i let it go too and float very ungracefully behind him  matt now because you guys dont have air in your lungs youre not buoyant to the point where  youre not fighting weight it brought you to the bottom easier so you didnt have to 
none	 swim your way  underneath but now youre here the cannonball is unnecessary to weigh you down  liam were ed harris now  matt essentially you arc over and you land on the deck for a moment as you glance around its  very spooky to be back in this familiar place in a very different setting its a strange ghostship  type chill that runs up your back looking around and having flash memories of pulling up the anchor  on that side and having conversations over that edge at sea you and vandren having a deep  
none	 conversation there under the main mast  travis his quarters are that way we should push forward  laura okay  travis swim over  matt okay you swim through the door its currently open and the hinges rusted and pulled  off and the tops of the doors broken and akimbo you make your way into the darkened interior  chamber the door to vandrens chamber is closed what do you want to do  laura do you think its locked  travis i imagine so could be still  laura he wouldnt have trapped it or anything  
none	 travis i would say no but there seem to be more than a few things that i didnt know about him  laura i dont have any i mean i can try to look for traps or something but  matt yeah go for it roll lets say a perception to see if you see anything strange or  out of the ordinary  laura 14  matt 14 doesnt look like there are any traps affixed to the door  travis youre so strong might want to give it a  laura rattling  matt theres a bit of 
none	 a rust resistance but youre pretty beefy you shove it with your  shoulder and it opens up you can see all the silt get kicked off and slowly cloud the space  around it as you push the door open  laura now i know why you asked me to come with you  matt you step through and look inside you see the familiar quarters of vandren though they look tossed  travis really  matt as you look inside theres the table where he normally sat and read his books that table is  set over the 
none	 shelf is pushed over looks like most everything in here has been in some way  shape or form tossed you remember there being all sorts of decorations that he kept in here  metal candle holders its all missing  travis its all missing is there anything that i  matt at first glance  travis is there anything that i see that is definitely out of place or changed that i remember  matt make a perception check  travis third one of the day lets go with this dice natural one  matt oh buddy  sam 
none	 youre nervous down there  travis apparently you can pee down here and nobodyd notice  matt you just stand in the doorway as opposed to doing a thorough investigation of the room and  glance around and begin tying memories and moments and getting lost in that headspace you  do a notverythorough check over the interior  travis maybe we should get the others and what fucking extra  liam shes giving you your pills  travis im always eating stuff maybe we should get some of the others to come in and do a more  laura 
none	 thorough investigation  travis yeah  laura i mean okay  travis unless you want to give it a look  laura does it look like somebody stole things from here  travis yeah he was a tidy man he certainly wouldnt have left things like this it looks  like either before or after it went down somebody was definitely fucking looking for something  laura do you know if he kept anything in a secret place  travis do i i dont think i do  laura because maybe he took it all with him maybe he left 
none	  travis could be yeah ill go get caduceus and caleb  laura beau is really good at finding things i think  travis ill go get everybody  laura ill keep looking around the room while he  matt okay youre doing a thorough investigation of the interior roll an investigation check as  you rummage through the wreckage  laura 13  matt okay looking through and moving some things aside because youre a sturdy tiefling pushing  things out of the way while youre off you glance underneath the table in the far left corner you  
none	 see a reinforced metal box somewhat melted along one edge just faintly its left open the lock  mechanism on it appears to have been broken by brute force where it was forced open there are  some heavy claw marks along the edges where the metal itself looks scarred the interior as you  pull it open and look inside is set with a leather recess on each side top and bottom soft  leather with two halves that are somewhat spherical like to hold a small apple  laura oh no it got taken fjords going to be 
none	 so upset can i cast locate object and see if i can  sense the orb around within a thousand feet  matt yeah you cast locate object concentrating on the orb let me have a quick glance at this  liam is one the same as another  matt all right  sam if you find the orb you should totally bond with it and get all the water powers that fjord wants  laura oh my god that would be so amazing  liam she already has them  sam just because  matt okay so youre not 
none	 looking for the orb that fjord has something similar to it  laura right  matt okay you do suddenly acknowledge your head pulls at the back of your skull and you  glance over your shoulder away from the ship  laura gasping  sam hello  matt just as everyone else returns and comes in the chamber  laura fjord  taliesin well this is a mess  laura fjord  travis what  laura it got taken the orb is gone  travis no  laura yeah but its over there  travis what do you mean 
none	  laura my spidey sense is tingling its behind us its over there i used locate object  travis thats amazing lead the way  laura you want to go now you dont want to look around or any  travis no lets go now  sam you dragged us in here to look around and now were not going to look around  taliesin i think doing a onceover might not be a bad idea  marisha why dont you guys go get a head start and well  liam in the ocean lets take  laura locate object 
none	 lasts ten minutes if it takes longer to get there then  marisha you guys go  laura well come back  marisha well check it out real quick  taliesin maybe bring the little octopi with you  liam yeah i schloof frumpkin to the back of caduceus head  taliesin oh okay thats a  matt slurping the tentacles wrap around and grasp  taliesin thats okay  matt its like a reverse facehugger  laura whos coming with fjord  taliesin i think we should probably all stick together one way or the other  laura i 
none	 think all of us should go  travis do you know how far away it was  laura within a thousand feet  matt roughly the direction you know you sense its probably between seven to eight hundred feet  from your current location  travis all right yes fine take five minutes six minutes and  laura no  liam while theyre debating i spit out four globules of light and start casing the room  matt okay  laura you have two minutes  taliesin im going to let the flora and fauna in here know that were 
none	 looking for some stuff one  of our people used to live here well be gone and everythings going to be fine  marisha ill do a quick glance for anything that looks like it could have loose boards secret compartments  matt make an investigation check  laura while theyre looking i want to point out to everyone that whatever it was that took this  ball has claws and it looks like it could break this thing open it looks like it might do some  damage to us  travis is it dented at all or just 
none	 scratched  taliesin how big a creature does it look like was taking a  matt make a nature check  travis yeah like an inch between the claw marks or a couple inches  liam 21 on investigation  marisha 19  matt okay  taliesin 14  matt okay looking at it the claw marks are probably roughly an inch to an inch and a half  apart and theres four of them it looks like an indentation for a thumb across one side almost  like whoever was grabbing it was pulling it open this way and 
none	 as they pulled it open their  fingers scratched across the metal as it bent and broke open  laura its bad  travis while theyre doing this you can tell if it moves right  laura mmhmm  travis okay  marisha they mentioned that dashilla has claws that grasp just throwing that out there really  committed that song to memory  sam hungry eye claws yeah  marisha claws that grasp  travis glad you remembered that im kind of forgetful  matt as you guys finish doing your onceover of the chamber you find a false 
none	 shelf bottom under  one of the bookcases that was toppled over as you pull inside it looks like it may have been what  this box was inside it has been pulled open and broken the wood compartment partially shattered  in the front looking through this room has been pretty ransacked  liam the books are basically mud at this point correct  matt yeah what remains of the handful of bound leather tomes in the vicinity have mostly joined  the muck at the bottom of the ocean  travis here underwater yeah  taliesin maybe its 
none	 time to  travis might be did you find anything underneath any remnants of that explosion  package shrapnel anything like that  taliesin just a little walk around just to get a sense of the place  matt okay going through you go through a number of cabins chambers this isnt an incredibly  massive ship it was mainly used for sailing and for transport its strange for you to go back  once again following through caduceus and looking and finding your old chambers as well a lot of  the rooms from the explosion have been destroyed 
none	 because of your generally perceptive persona you  can see elements where this explosion happened there are stains of individuals that may have been  in the proximity but no sign of their bodies  taliesin hm no  matt you begin to piece together the power and the source of this detonation and you get caught  up slightly thumbing through the memories and remembering the people and the faces that used to  serve on this ship with you remembering the room where sabian stayed wondering if sabian  survived who else may have but he also was 
none	 the one jumping from the deck when the explosion hit  everything has been cleaned out this appears salvaged somebody has come through here and taken  from the interior  travis i think its safe to assume that that was done after the ship sunk a hole this size  wouldnt keep a vessel in the water very long  marisha no do we know anything about underwater creatures that would be interested in i dont know  travis glowing eyes  marisha yeah jewels  travis pretties  marisha underwater goblins  matt i mean there are a 
none	 number of creatures of folklore and things that are greedy no matter  where they live  travis locate ariel  marisha yeah mermaids i dont know  matt make a history check  liam it could also be someone who was having dreams fjord  travis true very true  marisha 18  matt i mean there was one other time that you encountered creatures that seemed to be gathering  and hoarding things that were shiny and happened to be affiliated with underwater existence  marisha yeah right  travis im sorry i cant wait any longer do 
none	 you mind if we go this is all too strange  laura be on guard  matt where are you exiting  travis fuck it well go back up above deck and well jump off the stern in the direction that jester  matt okay make a perception check for me  laura are the globules of light around  liam if we are in a group they are they were around the group  travis goddamn it  laura thats why i said switch to a fucking dice that i gave you  liam take your pills travis take 
none	 your pills  travis three  matt in your excitement in having this thread of possibility towards recovering this third and  final orb from what you understand you immediately turn around and swim and dart outward  towards where the deck is into the open waters just as your eyes clarify to see three large  figures that are floating about 20 or so feet ahead that seems to have encircled the deck in  but a split second you can immediately make out their outline you can see the sides of the  frilled head you can see 
none	 the long fishlike lower torso and you can see the familiar tridents  with chains affixed to the edge  laura fuck now were underwater with them  marisha now were going to fight underwater  matt lets roll initiative  travis oh no  matt it seems that in these darkened waters light sources can be very easy to see  laura shit shit shit  liam how about a high roll nope  travis were good were good  laura shit shit shit balls shit  sam guys backblaze can back up your stuff whoa  laura wow 
none	 this is so cool matthew  sam someone went to the aquatic store  taliesin thank you petco  travis yeah dude  laura look at that coolass bustedup ship  sam did you bust up the ship or does it come busted up  matt it came like this busted up  laura and sam what  matt marching order if you dont mind of who was behind fjord  travis ill let yall crawl up  laura i would have been close behind because  liam singing caleb takes the rear  matt yasha probably right behind there 
tavern	  marisha ill be behind yasha  matt all right caleb takes the rear  taliesin yeah i dont know if i was quite outside yet i think beau and i maybe switch  places if thats okay  matt beau said she was behind yasha  marisha well i can switch with cad  matt thats up to you fine caduceus inside there all right then theres beau and nott  sam im way back there not even looking  matt chilling with caleb all right  travis wanting to be drunk but not really  sam oh im 
tavern	 drunk  laura are you how are you drunk  marisha hes dehydrated  sam i got drunk before we came underwater thats the only way i could go underwater  laura oh no these trident things are really bad do you remember how bad they are  sam no  marisha dont they have harpoon chains  laura yeah  matt initiative order please 25 to 20 anyone  taliesin crickets  travis oh shit  matt 20 to 15  laura 15  travis yasha got a 17  marisha 15  matt yasha got 17 all right 
none	  travis wow thats high for her  matt all right then 15 for beau and jester all right 15 to ten  travis 14  matt 14 for fjord  travis fuck guys  matt all right ten to five  liam sechs  sam seven  matt all right  travis oh jesus  matt caduceus  taliesin four  matt all righty  travis yeah good start here we go the pendulum swings wildly  marisha from where we were last week  matt great top of the round first up is yasha  travis yeah she 
dung	 is right yeah and she is back there oh and there they are okay lovely  underwater is her speed halved  matt everyones speed is halved underwater  travis except mine  matt except yours  travis my armor wow good fucking deal okay  marisha man this sucks how are we supposed to get to those assholes we can swim  travis how far in this diagonal movement would 20 feet get yasha towards the nearest enemy  matt her movement speed is 40 right  travis yeah  matt 20 feet would get her almost into melee 
none	 with this one  travis almost  matt yeah just outside of it  travis okay she will swim towards that merrow and with her bonus action she would like to rage  sam underwater rage  matt all right so rage then she can use her action to dash and move again if shes not  attacking with it  travis oh yes then lets do that and get within melee  matt all right she gets into melee with that figure there you got it that finishes yashas  go beau and jester your turns  marisha you 
none	 want to go first  laura sure ill use guiding bolt  matt all right against which one  laura the one that yashas attacking  matt okay go for it roll for an attack  travis as a point of order can she also yell dont let them leave  laura yasha  matt sure  marisha they always bring more friends  laura 16  matt 16 hits go ahead and roll damage on that one  travis that was more caleb than yasha but  sam dont let them leave  laura 4d6 thats cocked  matt 
none	 slightly norse  travis thats it  laura 11 15 17 points  matt nice that one next attack on it has advantage  laura yes  matt as yasha says that jester glances over puts her hand out this sparkling radiant light  goes through the water leaving this vacuum trail behind as the bolt slams into the merrow  brightening up around its chest with the impact of the magical energy now its form is glittering  with that light making it very easy to spot its location do you want to move or stay where you are 
none	  laura yeah im going to back up  matt back up back inside  laura yeah yeah thats good  matt you move inside the chamber there okay  laura to be not within five feet of caleb i want to be against the wall of whatever that  yeah like that  matt you got it that ends your turn beau what are you doing  marisha am i within 20 feet of the guy that she just marked if i swim up  matt you have 25 feet you can get right up to it ill shift 
none	 these guys here a little bit to  make a space for it where they were  marisha i jump off and parkour off  sam slow motion parkour  marisha i get really frustrated and so i dog paddle the rest of the way then im going to take my  matt is your speed 50 then  marisha no its 45 thats why i was saying 20 feet  matt oh got you so it would be 20 feet because you round down in dd unless it specially says  otherwise so youd be just out of range 
none	  marisha then let me spend a ki point to do step of the wind  matt all right thatll get you the distance you need there  marisha which sucks but thats okay then im going to attack  matt singing do it  marisha just jam my staff into its face not too bad 22  matt 22 hits  marisha okay thats good ten  matt ten points of damage you have advantage on that attack by the way because of the guiding bolt  marisha lets see if its a natural 20 it is not a 
none	 natural 20 then okay hang on i used my bonus  action oh i get one more hit  liam cocked  matt you do not have advantage on that one only the first one  marisha and liam it was cocked  matt oh got you  marisha thats not good though that is 12  matt 12 misses unfortunately the first strike manages to clock it in the face however as you  go to swing backward the water resistance in itself which actually this is a good point of  order remember youre underwater remember this going 
none	 forward melee attacks and weapon attacks  have disadvantage  groaning  travis fuck a duck yeah okay that changes shit thats got to go oh boy oh yeah  taliesin i mean it means your advantage cancels that out though so  matt a melee weapon attack ranged weapon attacks automatically miss if theyre beyond the normal  range the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow a net or a weapon thats  thrown like a javelin so technically nott your attacks are fine underwater  laura but magic attacks are fine  matt magic 
none	 attacks are fine but melee weapon attacks have disadvantage  marisha who is that next to me is that yasha  matt and laura yeah  marisha okay im going to spend another ki point to do patient defense  matt youve already used your bonus action to  marisha oh shit sorry youre right i forgot that thats not a free action okay im done  matt no worries after the resistance of the water keeps your blow from coming with too much  impact the merrow spins to you as its jaw opens theres the rows of tiny 
none	 sharp teeth its creepy  when its right in front of you these are similar but different than the ones you fought  before up at the swamp these have longer more sallow features they seem to be a little bit more  oceanbased and as such theres a variation to how they look that finishes jesters and beaus  turn fjord youre up  travis i will with my bonus action cast hexblades curse on this merrow the one thats in  the middle and i will fire two eldritch blasts at it  matt go for it  
dung	 sam and travis drawn out eldritch blasts  travis oh theyre both 18s so 25 to hit both  matt both hit  travis four so thats 12 points of damage the second one is nine points of damage so 21  matt it gets hit twice in the chest it tries to loop around now you can see the shapes against  the little bit of light you can see from the surface above but its still very dark in the  vicinity aside from the globes he has behind  travis actually you gain plus three to damage 
none	 rolls on hexblades curse so instead of 21  matt oh so you cursed that guy  travis yeah with my bonus action i did that first so 22 total so add three with my  movement i will move back under the deck where caduceus and caleb and jester are  matt you going to stay in the doorway or move into the chamber  travis one step in  matt all right one step into the room  travis yeah  matt okay so youd still be there  travis not so im blocking the entry but just 
none	 so that im in out of thrownharpoon way you know  what i mean  matt okay so you probably move that way then that ends your go that brings us to their turn  sam oh no  matt this one right there in the front its going to make lets see here  sam 16 attacks  matt one bite with its claw and one with its bite against im going to say you since youre the  only one who actually managed to connect with it physically as you rush up into its face and slam  
none	 it once the other attack misses as it curves under it goes snarling its jaw opens to try  and snap towards your shoulder and neck area  marisha yasha gets a sentinel attack yeah  laura yeah thats what i was going to say  matt no they do not because they both have sentinel we have to remember that  marisha fuck  travis if they both have sentinel  matt yeah if they both have sentinel they cant bounce attacks we kept forgetting that in the past  marisha you cant do that technically  liam theres 
none	 too much awesome in one spot  marisha thats literally what it is  matt because the combination becomes super broken thats going to be a  laura dont attack the same thing you guys  matt 19 to hit  marisha yeah  matt all right and then the claw attack ooh thats going to be a 22 to hit you suffer from  the bite attack nine points of piercing damage  marisha suffer me the little merrow  matt then the claws deal ten points of slashing damage  marisha all right  matt its going to 
none	 attempt to move out of the way of each of you because it doesnt know any better  it has a swim speed of 40 feet so its going to attempt to pull back to get some range you each  technically get an attack of opportunity on it  marisha pop pop  matt its hoping disadvantage on each attack  travis ill make it reckless  matt you cant make reckless you have to do on your turn i think  marisha one was a natural 20 from gil  matt what was the other  marisha cant 
none	 use it it was a seven 14 for me  sam oh thats not bad  matt 14 hits  marisha and laura yay  taliesin good to know  matt reckless attack when you make your first attack on your turn so you have to choose it on  your turn  travis got you 19 to hit  matt 19 still hits yeah you both can attack and it does not move it tries to pull away and  marisha thats right because sentinel cheering  matt there you go see now it pays off  travis 13 
none	 points of slashing damage  marisha 11 points of damage from me  laura punching damage  marisha of punching damage yeah  matt it tries to back away hoping that the water itself will help protect it to pull away nuhuh  the two ladies are not going to let it flee whack one hit from beau as yasha through the  water carves with the greatsword magicians judge hitting across the chest you can see this  deep red cloud form around its chest as it tries to pull away you hold it in place unable to escape 
none	  marisha just like the opening title sequence you guys  matt there you go  laura yeah i know i was about to say  marisha so good  matt this one thats hexed is going to move down towards the deck itll glance through and it sees  caleb its going to move in a little closer to caleb and as it pulls its harpoon back it throws  it forward towards you its going to attempt to harpoon you caleb that is a 19 to hit  groaning  liam i shite take it  laura but 
none	 youre going to get harpooned in youll be grappled  liam theres nothing to do about it  matt you take 11 points of piercing damage im going to need you to make a strength check  liam im good at those  sam oh thats your best youll be fine  matt its contested  liam thats a six  matt yeah you get pulled out of the interior  laura no  liam how much did i get harpooned for 11 was it 11  matt 11  laura can we grab onto him for a reaction  
none	 matt nope caleb stands there in the back looking and all of a sudden impacts into his  chest the thing pierces in the stomach area there and then gets pulled out you try to reach for  him but hes already gone and he gets pulled out in the middle of the open area from there comes  the shallow priests turn  laura oh no  sam the shallow priest  marisha we fought one of those last time  sam we did  marisha yeah  liam it lightninged us  taliesin it went great  marisha 
none	 yes we did  laura whats its weakness beau  marisha im looking  matt the shallow priest is going to move down and its going to move to there its going to attempt  to harpoon caleb out of the other ones grasp as well its trying to chain pull you away thats  going to be a 17 to hit  liam shield  matt the harpoon ricochets off of the shield and goes limp the creature pulls on the chain as it  falls back into its grasp its currently clutching its staff in the other hand 
tavern	 and its  going to pull back for the rest of its movement there out of the vicinity thats going to end  their turn now it comes to nott  sam screams seeing my friend pulled away i will swim reluctantly forward stagger near him and say  to the creature thats captured him hey fuckey what do you give a merrow who sings poorly autotuna  groaning  travis wow  sam laughing im drunk motherfucker  liam ive abandoned my son  travis the last syllable delivered that one  sam i will cast tashas hideous laughter 
none	  matt oh gotcha its a wisdom saving throw  sam wisdom yes 14 not a high mark  matt the one that currently has caleb that is going to be a 12 success  sam so do they let go it says they fall prone which they cant do underwater but they are  incapacitated it says so do they let go  matt the harpoon that pulled caleb in has been pulled out of the wound and theres a little bit  of blood thats now trailing from the initial impact caleb is not currently held or grappled 
none	  its just not in his face  sam oh hes not impaled or anything  matt not at this moment when it pulled him in it pulled it out of his body but its right in  front of him  sam then i will use the rest if i have any remaining movement to grab him by his scarf and  pull him back away  matt you cant quite get up to him unfortunately because its 15 feet underwater  your speed of 30 is reduced to 15 and it took 15 feet to get far out 
none	 you could as a bonus  action dash to move up to him but you cant pull him back because you dont have an action to try  and grab  sam got it ooh tough i will bonus action dash and try to push him away push caleb to the right or  left out of the way  matt ill say make a strength check  sam okay nope oh wait this is at disadvantage  matt yes  sam even worse one ill save you  matt you feel this small push on your shoulder and you 
none	 see nott drift upside down in front of you as  the merrow who pulled you in with this terrible toothy grimace and starts going chuckling and is  bowling over chuckling its a weird moment that finishes notts go caleb youre up  liam so those two are incapacitated in this second right  matt that one is incapacitated  liam the one on top is not  matt no hes just held in place  liam okay well then i will cast slow on the shallow priest and the one thats laughing in front  of me as 
none	 well as i back away  matt all righty  taliesin what does slow give them  liam slowness  travis half their speed and  liam hurts their ac its a wisdom saving of 16  matt concentrating both of you guys wisdom saving throw thats a failure on the shallow  priest and the one thats over there rolled an 18 so thats incapacitated is fine with the slow  however the shallow priest is slowed  liam so shallow priests ac is down by two disadvantage on dex saves and he can only do an  action 
none	 or a bonus not both  matt correct if it tries to cast a spell it takes a full round back before it can even hit  liam i back away half my speed towards where everybody is in the boat i move behind my goblin freund  matt you just manage to get back inside of the chamber the doorways still open all right that  finishes your go caduceus youre up  travis come on cad  taliesin am i going to double this up how are you feeling  liam gurgling okay pretty good  taliesin pretty 
none	 good im going to use a bonus action i can do two first level spells in a  round right if ones bonus action one is an action thats fine  matt nope  taliesin just one or the other  matt one has to be cantrip and the other can be any level  taliesin cantrip there we go thank you im going to scoot past you with half of my action if  thats okay and take a look outside to see whats up how far away  matt you have five more of feet in movement there 
none	 stepping out of the doorway  taliesin i have five feet no matter what okay goddamn theres no getting back in anyway so  fuck it yeah theres no sense trying to get back inside im just going to be vulnerable how far  away is that one is that more than 30 feet away  matt yeah  taliesin theres no way i can get close enough to get within 30 feet right now is there  matt you can move five more feet you might you have to eyeball it and may take the risk  taliesin you 
none	 know what its not like distance is a problem here ill go in an angle and declump  yeah right there  matt counting ill say with the angle 30 hes just within range  taliesin i think all three of those are within 30 feet then at this point i think thats pretty  fair im casting bane on all three of them  oohing  travis fucking caduceus  taliesin thats a charisma save against 16  marisha theres no way these fuckers are charismatic  matt nope thats a fail one in the middle thats a ten 
none	 thats a fail over here thats a  five thats a fail they all have a minus one on their charisma  taliesin they all take a negative d4 from an attack or saving throws all three of them  matt not bad for a 1stlevel spell it doesnt get a lot of love  taliesin its not a bad 1stlevel spell  matt the water around seems to get even darker for a moment and ice crystals begin to form at the  edge of their bodies as the chill becomes unnatural and begins sluggishly shift their  movements 
none	 this cleric spell sending itself into their form that finishes your turn  taliesin thats everything i can do  matt finishing that up we can do the top of the round yashas up first  travis shes going to take two reckless attacks at this one that is near her for just a straight roll  matt go for it yasha by the way is no longer raging she wasnt attacked or didnt oh no but  she did get an attack of opportunity so she would be youre correct  travis so 20 on the first one  
none	 matt that hits  travis the second is a 24  matt yeah both hit  travis the first one counting damn it seven plus three is ten and the second one  matt first blow as she swings by carves through as it goes taut for a second all of its muscle  seizing and then goes limp as its torso begins to drift away from the lower half of its fish body  and it begins to slowly float off  travis great shit so if i didnt need that second attack did i waste it on the 
none	 one that was there  matt right now you still have the second attack it depends on the movement you have and i dont  what else you can get in range for  sam just hit beau shes right there  matt did you roll disadvantage on that attack by the way  travis i made it reckless so it was just a straight roll ill use the 20 feet to head down  towards the one that caduceus is right in front of  matt i would say that gets you right about there youd be just in 
none	 range for the one thats incapacitated  travis is that melee  matt yeah  travis okay yeah  matt its just a down it swims down  travis i should have to roll yeah  matt yeah reroll for this one  travis 17  matt 17 hits  travis okay great this does not have the extra d6 so thats three plus six is nine 12 points of  slashing damage  matt 12 points of slashing damage  laura is it hexed did you hex it  matt well this is yashas turn  laura oh this 
none	 is yasha  matt for your tashas hideous laughter i believe it gets to make a saving throw when it takes  damage is that correct  sam i will check at the end of each turn and each time it takes damage the target can make  another wisdom saving throw  matt that is a natural 18  taliesin wait take negative d4 to that too  matt thats right yes  sam but the target has advantage on the saving throw if its triggered by damage  matt okay the advantage didnt help it  travis im 
none	 sorry matt will you add two points of damage the last one that i just hit  matt ooh minus four brings it to 14  sam thats the spell  matt so it still resists it  taliesin wait what  matt it reduced it to 14 but 14 was the dc  taliesin okay ah well but its still got bane  laura that was still really cool  travis will you add two points of damage to him for rage damage because i didnt add that  laura youve got bane  taliesin you got baned  
none	 matt all right  taliesin banes pretty cool  matt that finishes that go all righty yashas turns done beau and jester  marisha heavy breathing im swimming to that guy im going to step of the wind can i make it  matt you dont need to you can get there  marisha no that guy  matt oh i see  marisha can i make it if i step of the wind  laura wait before you do it im going to guiding bolt him so you get advantage  marisha oh are you  matt you would 
none	 have to step of the wind to get to him  marisha okay and then ill let jester go first  laura im going to step out and guiding bolt him that was my plan  matt okay go ahead and attempt that  marisha so as shes swimming  laura that definitely hits thats 15 plus seven  matt yeah no that hits  splat noise  taliesin hey eh  sam terrible just terrible  laura 12  matt 12 points of damage to the shallow priest you got it  laura then you get advantage  matt 
none	 with that you move forward swimming through the water and then step of the wind use  another ki point to get up there fists at the ready  liam negative two to his ac  marisha okay that is a 22  matt 22 hits  marisha not too bad nine nein  matt nine points of damage on that one  marisha second roll does not have advantage correct it has disadvantage  matt well that first one should have been just a regular roll did you roll with advantage  marisha i did  matt just roll 
none	 once for the first attack for me again real fast  marisha i mean its the exact same thing its still 22  matt there you go for the second attack its disadvantage  marisha okay dont fuck me gil 17  matt 17 still hits  marisha hey gil nine  matt there you go nine and nine you swim forward rocketing forward aquamanstyle and  then two big hits to its face the shallow priest takes the impact but its body reacts slowly the  spell thats surrounding it is forcing it to move and shift at half 
none	 the pace it normally would  marisha i just slowmo go  laura from behind beau off in the distance i at the same time  matt like rack focuses from beaus middle finger to jesters middle finger perfect all right  that finishes beaus go fjord youre up  travis yes i will come out of the quarters to move within melee of the one that everybodys  having the party around  taliesin you may not be able to get to him  matt oh no you can because you dont have to worry about it  travis 
none	 yeah i have 30 feet ill take two swipes with my falchion at disadvantage  matt correct  travis theyre both 15 so thats a 23 to hit  matt that hits  travis thats seven points of slashing damage and the second one is only an 11  matt 11 to hit  travis yep  matt that misses unfortunately as the first one carves through the bloody cloud thats forming  from the wounds its sustaining gets thicker and bigger its looking pretty hurt  travis cool  matt that finishes your turn  travis yes  matt 
none	 now its their turn all right the shallow priest who is currently slowed is going to use  its action to do its multiattack so thats two attacks on you with its bite and claw its not  going to use any of its spells  liam does it get a multiattack or does it just get one attack  matt no thats right it doesnt get multiattack when its slowed  liam its a single attack  matt then its going to harpoon you its not going to bother with the claw and the bite its  going to 
none	 pull back with its one harpoon and try and thrust it into your chest  marisha wait to me  matt yes  taliesin with a negative d4  laura negative d4  matt correct thats two off of it that brings it from 19 to 17 whats your armor class  marisha 19  matt the bane prevents it from hitting you as it goes and thrusts the harpoon forward it  telegraphs it just enough that as it leaves you whoosh it nicks the very edge of your skin  ever so slightly and thats it  marisha 
none	 im like thats going to get infected now in the ocean  travis its the salt water itll be white around the edges and really sting  matt its going to attempt to move away  sam its moving away get it  laura oh no its moving away sentinel  matt go for it roll for an attack  marisha disadvantage right  matt yep  marisha its not good no i rolled a two and a one  liam its speed is halved  matt correct it would have a swim speed of 40 underwater so it can 
none	 only go 20 it manages to  pull out of the range up there and at the end of its turn it gets to  liam make a save  matt both of them make a save because theyre both well that one no that one missed the  slow that is a 11 plus three 14  taliesin minus four or minus a d4  matt minus four ten yeah its still slowed  taliesin dont you fuck around with me  matt its starting to turn around too seeing how things shifted here it saw the light and 
none	 you  can see what little bit of his expression underwater at this point they followed this light  to inspect it thought they had an ambush on a creature and suddenly this party emerged now  well that ones in a really rough spot this one is looking like its about to turn and try and flee  thats going to end the shallow priests turn and the other ones turn i havent done that one yet  right that one is going to attempt to use its harpoon against you fjord  travis okay  matt since you 
none	 ran up and carved at it or yeah its going to try that thats a natural 20  taliesin minus well it doesnt matter because it can still only bring it down to 18 right  matt its just not a critical hit  taliesin what  matt your ability youre talking about  taliesin no im saying that with the d4 it wouldnt bring that attack down at all would it  enough to be managed  matt it would still be a critical hit for a natural 20 but it would then be a total of it  
none	 would be a 22 still  taliesin well im canceling the critical anyway  matt you use channel divinity once to cancel the critical on that as the harpoon comes towards  you theres this slight dull green barrier that seems to slow the penetration of the immediate  lightningfast pace of this harpoon it manages to carve into the front of your armor and pierce  through ever so slightly its not a critical hit unfortunately  taliesin nope  matt thats 11 points of piercing damage to you after it carves through and wounds you it pushes  
none	 through the other way and you manage to roll off it wouldve been far worse damage if caduceus  hadnt helped you in that moment its going to attempt to move away yasha gets attack of opportunity  travis yes she does reckless for a straight roll  matt right because it is now reckless  travis this is her only reaction oh thats a 20 million 25  matt thatll hit  sam i dont get an attack  matt no because you were pushing him you werent moving in that area so youre not quite  in melee 
none	 with him  travis 11 plus three is 14 14 points of slashing damage  matt 14 points of damage it turns around and darts and yasha just whoosh one swipe with her  sword shes finishing them off left and right  laura yasha is such a badass  matt ashley come back  marisha and laura ashley come back  travis or take your time barbarians are dope yo  matt that finishes the merrows turn it did not go well for them in that brief instance nott  youre up  sam am i allowed to use 
tavern	 my crossbow  matt yeah your crossbow actually  travis doesnt have any damage to it yeah  laura thats what i said  travis you drunk fucker  sam i dont know what you people mean how far is they from me  matt theyre probably about 40 or so feet from you  sam i guess ill doggy paddle up ten feet  travis like a turtle  sam ill sea turtle up to them ten 15 feet so im within 30 feet and then i will fire my  crossbow its at disadvantage because its in the 
none	 water  matt actually crossbow does not get hit with that problem because theyre piercing however  whats your inside range its 30 feet  sam 30 feet  matt then yeah as long as youre inside range then youre fine you swim up there towards it as  youre kicking your feet and cocking the bolt back into it and go to aim just within range you see  it as its turning around to attempt to swim away at full speed  sam did it just take its turn  taliesin yeah  sam im going to hold

tavern	 to shoot not knowing what everyone else is doing  im drunk im going to shoot  travis theres not a lot of people that can get over there  sam its going to be 24 to hit  matt that hits  sam 27 to hit or something like that  taliesin 27  sam its a lot but its only 1d6 oh hey its a six  laura plus  sam plus five so 11  matt 11 points of piercing damage to the shallow priest you see another plume of dark ichor  pouring out the side 
none	 of its wound as the bolt is now about three or four inches jutting out of the  side of its torso it glances sidelong at you and seems to inspire it to try and move faster that  finishes your turn nott  sam bonus action shoot again  marisha kill it  sam oh thats a three  matt not so much on that one unfortunately  sam i can reload  matt finishing that go caleb your turn  liam from where im standing i see nott firing drunkenly up at an angle im going to move 
none	  forward and peek up in the direction that she is looking and see the shallow king and say fick  das i will cast magic missile at level three  marisha fick dish  sam its fish dick  liam no its fick das  travis not anymore fish dick  marisha fish dick  laura whispers fish dicks  sam id love a nice fish dick right now with some tartar sauce  travis i could eat the shit out of those  liam a total of 19  matt 19 damage all right how do you want 
none	 to do this  travis oh you got him  laura you killed it  liam the five of the magic missiles will spiral around fish dicks head and come in at a different  angle and five of them go impacts  matt okay it gets some distance caleb feeling comfortable lets the missiles arc past and up and  over as they swirl and gather they all come in at once and this darkened shape suddenly theres a  flash of arcane energy and this strange little bubble explosion where it was the impact happens  and its 
none	 arms separate from the impact they hit in the torso blew it apart from the inside theres  a little cloud of darkness left behind as it begins to slowly disseminate among the rest of the  sea water around  liam i will step back in five feet  travis check their corpses see if they have anything on them that can tell where they came from  sam they came from the ocean fjord  travis nott really weve got to get over this fear man we got a job to do  sam no theyre from the 
none	 ocean where else would they be from  travis but where in the ocean where  sam isnt all the ocean the same  travis no  marisha this ones the great barrier reef i dont know  matt here in the shadowed darkness  laura can we search the bodies  sam ill search the bodies  marisha we search the limbs  matt on the two regular merrow that you came across you find that they have their  harpoon there are definitely teeth upon their bodies and claws as part of their physical form  theyre not 
none	 carrying much on them per se beyond the equipment they have and a handful of collected  shiny things a few copper a key that was scrounged up thats old and very rusted looks  like maybe a handful of  marisha zelda has taught us we want the key  matt all right you have a rusted key  travis dont do it like that you know that shits important  marisha mmhmm  taliesin 11 months from now do you have the rusty key  travis if only we could close the barrier to the  matt the 
none	 shallow priest since it was destroyed a ways off some of its accoutrements were left to  scatter and float below you do manage to find on what pieces you do scrounge up a heavy necklace  made of these larger pearls probably worth a little bit of gold on the side thats about it  laura can i hold up one of the fish claws and see if it matches the claws that are on the box  matt okay  sam im going to take the pearl necklace  matt all right write that down inspecting where the 
none	 hands meet with the box no these are a  different size  laura you guys its not the same fish claws its something bigger that had the box  sam oh fuck you  matt slightly larger at least it seems  sam im out of here guys its been real  travis wait nott were about to cross the area of the button graveyard that lies beneath the waves  sam can you hear yourself right now you sound pathetic pathetic  travis im just looking out for you nott i dont want you to  sam i 
tavern	 understand when im being condescended to even when im drunk  liam all right lets treat this situation with the seriousness it demands i douse the lights and  bring frumpkin down onto my own head like a mask so i can see through frumpkin vision  matt all right so you have a  liam like a zorro mask with frumpkins beak right there  matt you see these two dark octopus eyes and then this little unshaven grin poking through underneath  liam little zemnian man whos like cant believe i didnt think of this sooner  travis 
none	 jester im sure all that action probably messed up your locate or is it still up somehow  laura it only lasts for ten minutes so i mean we might be coming to the very end of it  matt id say you have a few more minutes on it still because you didnt cast any other  concentration spells and you didnt take any damage so youre fine  laura its over that way its still 700 to 800 feet  travis would you lead the way  laura me  travis yeah  laura sure  taliesin how 
none	 many people got hurt in that fight by the way three of us i think took damage  liam no ein bisschen  laura you cant hear anything  taliesin while were walking its going to be about a tenminute walk is it insane to  matt you dont know  taliesin yeah as were walking im going to start prayer of healing i guess i know it takes  about ten minutes but its a onespell healall  matt okay if you want to  taliesin if thats okay everybody gets oh 17 points back  marisha whoa  
none	 matt well consider that as you guys are traveling youre helming this journey from that  direction make a perception check for me please  laura okay yeah 22  matt 22 thats great as you guys step off of the edge of your ships wreckage and all slowly  sink down to find the floor of the ocean once more and the subtle grade that continues downward as  you being to step following jester moving forward you see another shape begin to approach  jester you see it first and glance over its another ship  travis under 
none	 the water or on the surface  matt no another ship sunken here you continue on for another 100 or 150 or so feet and you see  the shape off to the right of another shipwreck  laura whispering its a graveyard  travis were definitely in that shit now the song yall remember the song  sam and marisha the divers grave  sam maybe we should go up for supplies  matt the spell fades but you still know the general direction of where it was coming from up  to you if you want to cast 
none	 it again or continue on based on the memory  laura lets continue  marisha do i see any sources of light  matt make a perception check  laura can we move stealthily underwater  matt you can certainly try youre moving halfspeed because of the water and youre moving  at half speed beyond that moving stealthily so its a very slow journey but you can do it  marisha 11  matt okay are you guys moving stealthily or not  marisha and liam yes  laura itll be a slow journey but we can try to 
none	 move  matt everyone make a stealth check and make a stealth check for yasha as well you guys are  moving at quarter speed essentially to move underwater  taliesin and laura six  sam and liam 19  marisha 25  travis 18 six  laura oh no were so evil but the average  matt the average is slightly in your favor youre on the edge there continuing forward it  evens out a bit this gradual calderatype valley that rests here before you the more you begin to  watch now that youre keeping an eye 
none	 for it theres a number of areas where wreckage can be  seen some of it very old the third ship that you pass by heading in the direction that you recall  has been down here for decades  marisha why here though why all these shipwrecks here especially if sabian planted a bomb on your  ship thats not because of natural causes is there something about this area that freaks people  out or something  travis i mean its always rough waters and the storms are frequent you normally make it through  with good prep 
none	 but i didnt know it was like this  marisha do we feel anything does it feel weird like any type of i dont know energy something  caduceus i look at caduceus  matt make a general wisdom check  travis her  matt yeah since shes attempting to get in tune with the energy of the atmosphere  marisha the roll reflects the vaguety of my question vaguety with a big old seven  matt you concentrate for a moment and the water gets slightly warmer  laura ooh i feel better  marisha ugh  matt you 
none	 decide to maybe not walk directly behind jester  travis its all sterile its fine  matt with the little bit of travel youre doing theyre sparse but there are a number of ships in  this large area that seem to have sunken at different times throughout the years  marisha i didnt see any source of light  matt no source of light no jester however whos been at the front keeping a close eye a  little ways in as youre peering out and clocking in each of these shipwrecks as they come across  you see 
none	 this little faint blip of light  laura is it moving or is it a blip or a what  matt you see it once or twice again its a little momentary shine  laura theres like a light yeah  sam over at the frankenstein house  taliesin i was waiting for it  laura i mean its in front of us yeah about how far away is it  matt at this point of travel its about 350 400 feet ahead of you  laura is it around where the orb feels like it is  matt the 
none	 general direction  travis we need to take a short rest  taliesin i mean i dont think thats  laura i wont get any use out of it  liam i would  laura 30 minutes we want to sit here in the open in the graveyard for an hour  travis we keep going but i think we remember from the song that that could be the lantern  light right  taliesin regardless im blind regardless  travis maybe we should fan out a bit  liam maybe bioluminescent just like an underwater creature  travis yeah 
none	 like a firing line  sam should i go up and prep the boat  travis no nott i need you here maybe give ourselves ten feet of distance between each other  and fan out  laura just think about how much damage you did when you were barely even trying  sam its all over me  taliesin i cant see so ill stick with somebody  laura you can stick with me  travis no the clerics are not sticking together  laura what  travis the clerics do not stay together anymore  sam yasha and 
none	 beau stay together the clerics stay together  marisha birds of a feather  taliesin ill stick with yasha  liam ill be with nott  travis well fan out in a wide line as we approach instead of as a group  matt all right if i could get a marching order please  laura oh this is like when we first started and we were in a line you guys remember and we were  looking for that witch  marisha yeah now were doing it again  matt whos together and what  travis am i with 
dung	 you jester  laura sure  taliesin yasha and clay and everyone else is singling or  liam caleb and nott are together  laura then beau jester and fjord in the middleish  liam it is like the beginning of the campaign  laura yeah  sam and it will be the end  laughter  matt what a nice book end you all begin to slowly move forward keeping your eyes peeled for  any sort of movement with no light it is extremely dark here with that faint little bit of  shimmering dull green from above 
none	  laura i should be on the other side of fjord so im closer to caleb  matt there you go as you guys continue to move in that direction some of you begin to see this  light as well caduceus first then you caleb and beau you see it looks like imagine if beams  of sunlight managed to roll across a piece of polished metal a little shining shifting sight  travis if shes a bigass anglerfish im going to be so pissed  marisha yeah nope i dont want to be eaten oh god  laura 
none	 thats definitely a glimmer pot  marisha glimmer pot  sam it was in the song  marisha oh yeah because it talks about enticing people with their lantern light treasure  treasure in their eyes  laura are we going to just walk straight towards it then or maybe  marisha well she has the eye  taliesin i think the notion is that youre not supposed to look directly in it some sort of  thing maybe  laura oh dont look at the light  taliesin dont look at whatever the eye or light or thing i 
none	 dont know  travis hey one of us has a familiar that can look for us right  laura good call  liam yeah  laura caleb send frumpkin up and see what the lantern light is  liam okay so i can do that i will send frumpkin low along the bottom in the direction of this  thing stealthily  matt are you guys staying put or are you continuing to move forward slowly  liam ooh lets take a lookyloo for the moment  matt you all sit tight for a second halting your position you watch 
none	 as the octopus makes its way  into the shadow ahead caleb youre focusing and it takes a while but frumpkin eventually  following this tiny shifting bead of golden light into view you begin to see towards the center of  where this large valley is there is a large cluster of long dead palewhite coral that  surrounds a rocky stone shelf  marisha too real  travis fucking awesome  matt make a perception check for frumpkin  laura bones  matt okay you see this coral space around its massive its maybe 250 300 feet across 
none	 and its  this dead chunk of coral reef in this vicinity that amassed around this central stone that rises  up theres a small crevasse on the side of it that goes down about 30 or so feet and you can see  fish weaving through  liam but i did see where this flashing source was  matt yeah but its occasional  liam occasional okay so its not like there was a creature that frumpkin and i were able to aim  towards it was just this thing that was appearing and disappearing  matt yeah and 
none	 maybe every now and then reorient the direction that frumpkin was traveling as you  come to see this space does frumpkin continue to get closer  liam yeah  matt okay frumpkin moves around and it takes a while because frumpkin isnt very good at  perceiving right now  taliesin thunk  matt you guys are getting a little impatient here hearing  travis were 300 feet away right  matt yeah  travis can we get within 100 feet  matt if you want to  travis yeah  laura keep moving forward slowly nott ill hold 
none	 calebs hand on the other side  matt you all continue to move forward  travis cautiously  liam so were connecting those two groups  laura whatever  liam were spread out a little  laura were spread out  matt frumpkin is going around and checking and finds that towards the front of this coral reef  area where this rock shelf is there appears to be an open cavern entrance right underneath this  shelf as frumpkin ducks down and looks you can see another one of the shine theres a few of them  travis oh 
none	 fuck  liam frumpkin will piss out some ink and use a bonus action to dash back towards the group  matt frumpkin quickly retracts and finds his way to the rest of you  laura what did you see  liam i tell him to come back and come out and say theres a lot of things just ahead of us over  the ridge  marisha what do you mean things  liam flashing moving things things that are alive  marisha oh  liam more than one i think  travis mmhmm  marisha more than one 
none	  liam i think so  marisha thats still in the direction of the orb  liam or something large with many parts but i could not tell too well  laura what was the glimmer  liam i could not tell you  laura he didnt see a lot did he  liam no its murky down here  travis who wants to take a look  sam why dont you  laura lets all just run forward and charge over the ridge  sam how about this heres an idea go back to the merrow that we killed 
none	 get one of their  tridents or whatever disguise self like youre one of them and then you can just swim in like  youre a bad fish  taliesin yeah i dont think thats a  laura is it going to work  taliesin no  marisha how do you know that the merrow are friends with these people  sam theyre not people  marisha well this group of angry things that might want to kill us  taliesin i think theyre going to be nervous that fjord doesnt speak the language and is moving at  half 
none	 plus he swims funny  liam i am reaffixing frumpkin to my face  marisha he actually swims really well  taliesin not for a fish person though  travis lets keep moving in yes theres nothing gained by staying up here  laura lets keep on going  liam but maybe  marisha someone say it  travis as we approach this area that hes described to us this white coral you said it was  in a valley like a dip  matt yep  travis at the top of where the valley is is there any cover 
none	 that we might be able to get up  behind and then peek down into said valley like boulders  matt as youre moving through this area there are clumps of seaweed that rise up hundreds of  feet out of view the base of it is pretty thick and you could try and move through that thats  what you are using to stealth as you come through darting from section to section of this heavy  underwater vegetation  laura can we cut some of the seaweed and hold it in front of us so that when we 
none	 move it just looks  like seaweed  matt sure  marisha kind of into it actually  matt travis and laura yeah  marisha ill jump on that train yeah  matt thats going to itch like a motherfucker in the morning  marisha thats okay were at the bottom of the ocean a lots going to itch  matt you slowly farm sections of seaweed and begin to shift your way forward using it as a  screen the shifting tendrils slowly shimmy along in the direction of this coral cluster  marisha can we ribbon dance a 
none	 little bit as we go  matt there you go  liam just you two right is this the group  laura no all of us are doing it whoever wants to be stealthy and be a brilliant person i guess  marisha i just wrap some seaweed around caleb  liam okay  matt whos at the front of this journey maintaining a similar position  travis i will be  matt okay perception check and one other person if they wish to  taliesin i dont have  travis oh yeah he doesnt have darkvision  laura i 
none	 mean i can try  marisha sure  laura okay  marisha oh go yeah youre leading the pack  matt both of you guys roll perception  laura and travis 17  matt okay  taliesin there you go  matt as you both come up to the edge of where the sandbank here seems to slightly descend in a  series of soft steps before that small ravine carves down and that large chunk of rock stands  there you can see the cavern you see once again that shifting its like a wave of light passes  
none	 over you can see its coins a bunch of light passes over coins that are scattered amongst the  floor of the entrance of this tunnel  travis oh theres an entrance to the tunnel okay  laura can we see what made the light  matt not from this distance  sam coins  marisha this is it  liam so the ground is littered with coins outside of this  matt you saw at the entrance a handful of coins that caught the light yeah  sam is buttonbeard is real  travis nott did you think i 
tavern	 was lying  sam i thought it was just a legend  travis im hurt our friendship has taken damage from this exchange  sam hes real  travis like santa claus you might have to go up and check for yourself tug on the beard see if  marisha and taliesin this is a terrible idea  travis but do it by yourself  marisha this is literally exactly  laura dont do that  sam i could go  laura shes drunk dont tell her to do stupid things  sam i could go over and just take 
none	 a look  marisha nope thats how people die  travis how much do you love buttons  marisha fjord remember when i said i would check you when youre being a dick  sam no  travis yeah no i do yeah all right fine we do it together  marisha okay i dont think we should go in this way  taliesin i dont think we should go in this way either  travis im open to suggestions  marisha it literally says treasure is in their eyes they swim for treasure in the lantern  light this 
none	 is a pot this is a honeypot for sure  laura can we swim around and look for another entrance to this cavern  travis dont one of yall have a copy of yourselves that you could send in a certain distance  laura i mean i can only get it 120 feet away from me  liam it will also put it at alert even before we get there you send it in and it sees this other  jester and then it is ready for a fight  sam i could send an image of a fish or 
none	 something in there and see what happens or some other type  of creature  travis i mean if its a trap that can be sprung by something going in maybe fish or maybe a  humanoid that would probably be good  laura no we dont want it to know were here  travis well theyre going to know really quick right were not going to make it in silently  right i mean this is clearly a honeypot its a trap might as well spring the trap  liam well  marisha i mean we could send in 
none	 an image of a fish and see but an image of a fish its not  movement of water its not the same  liam were on this ridge  matt youre maybe about since you stopped at that edge before it begins to descend over youre  about 60 or so feet from this  liam what do we see to the sides and so theres a cavern straight ahead facing towards us  matt yeah ahead and facing towards you guys with a large shelf that protrudes over it that puts it  mostly in shadow and the 
none	 corals built all around that if you wanted to try and move around it you  could but its about 200 or so feet across  liam that is my point i think we quietly go around and get on top of the house and throw  whatever the bait is in front and then were back here for whatever comes out  sam hes very smart  taliesin i think thats a very reasonable plan  travis i agree lets do that  laura then i can send jester down there  travis mmhmm lets do it  laura 
none	 okay  travis make it so  matt you guys swim across towards the top all right you paddle up as a group up  travis and laura around  matt oh around  marisha around not over top  liam take our time  matt you guys move slowly around still moving stealthily to the edges then you move up and  over what are you doing  sam yes  matt okay  travis around the sides of the map instead of just across  liam sitting on top of it  matt you get up and slowly 
none	 descend towards where the coral is your feet find the edges some of it  is brittle and as your foot touches it snaps and parts of it crumble at the very edges but nothing  that you feel will alert your presence necessarily  travis conserve the reef you guys be responsible divers  marisha its so sad dont drop anchors anyway continue  matt as you move up to the edge of the shelf and you glance over the edge you see the shadow  entrance of the cavern before you once again that shimmer finds its way 
none	 across a dozen or more coins  that are visible partially embedded in the muck and sand there at the foot of this cavern entrance  laura should i try to send my duplicate down  taliesin one question this is definitely coral that we are sitting on top of right  matt its bits of coral when you step out towards that shelf the coral recedes and now its  a protruding large slab of stone  taliesin it is a protruding large slab of stone and not a bigass mouth or anything like that right  matt make 
none	 a perception check  travis oh come on  marisha its always a bigass mouth  taliesin im looking at it raspberry 11  liam you just turned 12 years old  taliesin its been a day  matt it looks to be stone  taliesin exaggerated sighing im putting tinfoil on my windows now im fucking done  liam yes dm  taliesin yes dm i think we send jester  laura okay im going to create my duplicate  matt okay so you use channel divinity once and you send your duplicate to swim down  laura im 
none	 going to swim down and im going to have her skip around and see the coins and be  like and go over and act like shes going to try to get the coins  matt okay you watch as the illusory jester goes and performs a great stock video of excited lucky  person performing the reaction silently  travis can it please be the infomercials where she has trouble collecting the coins  matt have you ever  marisha oh no  matt dont you hate it when  travis i cant hold shit  matt 30 seconds 
none	 pass of jester doing the song and dance down there no reaction  laura shit it might need actual vibrations or  travis no theres nothing down there ill jump down there and join jester  matt okay fjord dives off the side and swims down towards the entrance to this cavern as you  approach you can see the coins plainly in front of you do you land at the entrance  travis mmhmm  matt okay your feet find soft footfall on the sediment that has gathered there knocking up a  little bit of it for a 
none	 minute before it all eventually settles once more looking inside make  a perception check  travis really good on these today three  matt okay  liam shitty rolls at this table  matt you glance inside theres no source of the light that you keep seeing flashing by you look  down and theres no glittering anymore theres no traveling light beam but the coins are there in  front of you looking up into the cavern it continues in and seems to descend and open up into  a chamber just where your darkvision ends  travis 
none	 looks fine  matt the inside is filled with seaweed as well it seems to be running up the walls of the  interior as well as a section of it sitting in the center of the main chamber its a different  color than the seaweed that youve been using to get here  travis ill look up where everybody is and im like  taliesin i think maybe we just dont take the coins maybe  marisha yeah maybe no one touches the treasure  sam distressed noises  laura nott dont im going to hold onto nott 
none	 as we jump down  marisha buttonbeard knows who touches his treasure and who doesnt  sam is that part of the legend  laura yeah theres more treasure inside if you make it past the initial treasure  sam i believe you  travis im already down here so ill summon the falchion  matt with a slight displacement and popping sound of the water making room for the falchion as it  emerges it hums slightly in your grasp being this deep in the ocean  travis ill hold it up is the eye doing anything other than 
none	 casting that glowing light  matt no but it is casting it and it is very present there is a faint hint of eagerness  brimming from within you  travis yall do something before i get reckless  marisha lets go  laura were heading down  marisha im going to swim and try not to touch the ocean floor  matt okay so you stay up above all of you make your way towards the entrance to this cavern  laura im going to send the duplicate out in front of us ive still got 30 seconds left 
none	 of it  liam im going to keep an eye on our rear  taliesin the minute i hear things start im going to cast some light on the walls so i can see shit  matt all right that will be caleb at the back jester and fjord towards the front everyone else  staying in the center  sam jester said she was holding me  laura i am holding  matt thats right so you will be up with jester as you guys slowly begin to make your way into the tunnel  laura i let go 
none	 of nott as soon as were into the tunnel away from the coins  matt as you release nott into the water you guys begin to take your first steps into the interior  of the cavern were going to take a break  travis i knew it was coming it just  marisha i know  travis my backs sweating  matt well be back here in a minute to see what this strange chamber seems to hold  marisha i need to relisten to the tale of dashilla i need to go find that awesome ukulele  version

none	 central chamber where you see it goes in two different  directions to the right and left in the middle theres a large cluster of this purplishmaroon  seaweed the outside of the leaves have a tealish blue color it wraps up against the walls  as well as you swim through and move the still water shifts with your movement you can see some  of it sway and move with your movement  travis oh fucking jesus our stealth is going to be balls here what does the floor look like  sand silt coins  matt looking 
none	 down make an investigation check  travis cant you just tell me  marisha jesus travis  travis yeah nine  liam the hell is wrong with us tonight  marisha whats wrong with you  travis i used it up last week  matt apparently well if there was a week to use it  travis thats true  matt you sift your hand through underneath and feel you find an errant copper piece left there  that comes up into your fingers the rest of it appears to be general sand and soft silt that  clouds a 
none	 bit around your fingers as you pull your hand up from mucking around in it it settles  fairly quickly  travis do you want to keep your duplicate in front of us or is it gone  laura it only lasts for a minute but yes i can keep her there as long as she lasts  matt right about now she vanishes  laura shes gone  taliesin were in the room  matt yes  taliesin i may be blind other than what i can see but if i hit detect magic somethings going  to light 
none	 up in my  matt its certainly possible  taliesin all right im just saying if there was something i feel like i would know that  sam i could make an image of something ahead of us  taliesin im going to cast detect magic whyd i put a question mark at the end of that  marisha detect magic  taliesin im going to cast detect magic really quickly  matt okay nothing ahead of you seems to give a magical aura behind you ever so faintly  taliesin the magical auras coming from the mouth of the 
dung	 cave  matt its coming from the mouth of the cave towards the top  travis towards the top  taliesin oh its where the lights being projected from i imagine but nothing in the room  matt nothing in the room and you do know glancing at that magical aura coming from the  entranceway it is illusory in nature  taliesin i would also be able to sense something magic through it thats buried up to three feet down  matt correct  taliesin okay im not getting any other pings in here  matt nope  taliesin 
none	 just that weird thing up front nothing else  sam i will cast silent image and project a small dwarf man about 60 feet in front of us with a  beard made out of buttons and a pirate hat cocked to one side and hes walking all prim and proper  like he owns the place hes got a patch on his eye thats made out of a button  laughter  matt old buttonbeards legend lives on as buttonbeard trounces around the central chamber  no reaction  taliesin im going to ask the kelp hey guys this 
dung	 feels a little ominous youd let me know if  there was something untoward happening around here right right  matt you express your interests to the kelp well seaweed technically kelp is a little more  shallowbased yeah  taliesin thank you that is fair  liam what on earth are we doing  travis just hold on octopushead  marisha apparently kelp is shallow  sam youre wearing an octopus hes talking to seaweed theres a buttonbeard in front of us  this is totally normal  liam mine is functional  marisha sings circus tune  matt 
none	 youre all still standing in the entranceway as you come down into this central chamber its  about 35 40 feet from side to side and then it branches off to the right and left ahead of you  laura which way are we going  matt there is that central cluster of seaweed that is coming up and going against the ceiling  and you can see on the walls its still riding along the edges  travis were going to the right  sam and laura okay  taliesin im proud of you for that hopefully thatll be 
none	 the first good roll youve made tonight  travis did you hear anything from your talk  taliesin to be fair they dont really talk back but sometimes they can acknowledge these things  besides its polite  travis can we move towards the fork  matt you move towards the fork the chamber itself is ovallike but in the center of the  chamber is where theres a mass of the seaweed so youd have to curve around it to get to either exit  laura are there any pebbles on the ground or anything  matt there are 
none	 some wayward stones that you could probably  travis this seaweed in the middle of the chamber have we seen anything like this before  matt no all the seaweed in this chamber is a different color than what youve seen when you  came in everything else had a greenishblue tint to it this has a deep maroonpurple with a blue  outline across the exterior of each little thread of leaf  travis what was the color of the fruit in the fucking temple werent they like  marisha i think so  laura i think they were 
none	 yellow i pictured them like mangoes  matt yeah they were mangoesque  laura they were mangoesque  travis but the inside was purplish and red right well because it was obviously being fed blood  laura it was it was bloody  travis sorry trying to make a connection where there might not be one  marisha no i was with you  travis yeah no deal okay  laura can i toss one of the pebbles at a cluster of  matt it hits it moves with the impact with the faint bit that gets hit theres no 
none	 reaction  travis did we want to separate and go around and meet on the other side  laura what if theres something in the middle of the cluster can we use a stick or something you  want to use your staff and push the cluster  taliesin i literally cant see anything right now  laura oh theres a cluster of kelp in the middle of the room here  taliesin things tend to live  travis anybody have any objections to going to the right  sam no lets just do it  travis lets do it 
none	  sam fuck it right were all going to die down here anyway it doesnt matter  laura dont you think there might be something in the middle of all the kelp though  travis there might be but well keep an eye on it as we move around to the right i just have a  very strong feeling about going to the right its based off of really gut im right handed so  were going to go to the right  sam lets do it  marisha all right  laura do we see bubbles in the 
none	 water at all  matt make a perception check  laura ten no thats a nine so that is a 13  matt oh just you okay  taliesin i would ask permission before putting a light in the kelp to see if theres anything in there  matt no bubbles theres no aeration of the interior here  travis can we see a top to this chamber  matt glancing up yeah you can see where the seaweed gathers and bunches up towards meeting it  from the walls in the center of the chamber its maybe 15 feet 
none	 above you its not terribly tall  taliesin when was the yeah all right  travis okay can we start moving to the right will we be able to see a clear divide between the  two left and right passages  matt you can see the two sides yeah  travis its a divide that goes from ceiling to floor right its not some fucking uvula thats  hanging right there waiting to dangle  matt it looks like its a cavern  travis okay you know what im saying  marisha yeah im with you  liam i 
none	 am not what are we doing  sam were going to the right  liam lets go to the right then  travis hey nott stab the floor really fast  sam what  travis stab the floor with your dagger  sam shortsword  matt okay it goes a few inches into the soft floor of the chamber before it hits stone  sam its been pacified  travis thank you well continue to the right  matt okay you take your first step and you watch something drift across the entrance from wall to  wall some faint 
none	 glowing figure and is gone  travis yelling i dont like it  marisha shut up oh  travis its in my head  marisha oh okay  taliesin did it trip my detect magic sense at all  matt not magic sense no  laura is it undead or is it a ghost  marisha whispering its dashilla  taliesin im going to do another detect undead really quickly  matt okay give me the specifications on that one  taliesin all right eyes of the grave as an action you know the location of any undead within  
none	 60 feet of you that isnt behind total cover and isnt protected from divination magic until the  end of your next turn  matt okay got you how long does it last  taliesin six seconds  matt okay well say for the purposes of this this is a reaction to seeing this figure pass by  you definitely get an undead sense from whatever this figure is and then it merges with the wall  and is gone it appeared to be loosely humanoid in the brief glimpse you saw  taliesin we have undead  travis no 
none	  sam its a ghost ship  marisha is it going to be your crew  travis i dont know  marisha wait were not on your ship anymore  travis now were in the mouth of a beast ducey whats going on brother  taliesin i dont know im literally blind i want to light this  sam are you feeling scared down here now all of a sudden  taliesin just to start im going to throw some light into the center of the kelp  matt okay in the center of the kelp forest that sits in 
none	 the center of the chamber a source of  light begins to emanate like a lantern covered in soft diffusing material the beams protrude and  lighten up the chamber like a lantern as it goes through you have a better view of the interior  you notice that the kelp forest is cluttered with strips of cloth bones two or three merrow  corpses that have long decomposed and look tangled and wrapped and are held towards the ceiling  there are a handful of what might have been human remains tangled in that same seaweed  marisha okay 
none	  taliesin i think this thing is carnivorous  marisha the seaweed  taliesin yep  travis id say burn it down but you know singing under the sea  marisha singing doo doo ba doo  sam should we leave  taliesin i think we should leave  travis you know what who really needs the sphere should we just go back to the boat no i  didnt mean it either all right we move forward  marisha i dont think anyone should touch the seaweed  taliesin yeah lights off  laura wait lights off why lights 
none	 off  matt the light vanishes once more and darkness comes to the chamber  travis that shits going to reach out i dont know how to stop it  matt do you guys continue to the right chamber  sam sure  liam yes please  laura im holding my hands up like this in case anything reaches for me and my axe in my hand too  taliesin ive still got a few minutes of detect magic so if anything  matt understood fjord you just have this gentle chill on the back of your head like something 
none	  frozen just caressed the back of your skull and is gone  sam gentle chill like a jack johnson song  travis dont do this to me everyone else at this table is less susceptible to shit like that dont  do it to me okay i dont need this right now cool no problem  laura just dont make it like ring girl okay or like the grudge  travis oh stop why would you want to put it out there  liam or do  travis shushing  matt you continue forward through this tunnel around the 
none	 seaweed cluster in the center moving  through in the same order that you situated there theres just enough room maybe ten feet across  to stay comfortably youd want to singlefile it as you walk through the edges of the seaweed  begin to drift forward seemingly drawn in by the warmth of your bodies  marisha what  liam wait its drawing towards us or its pulling in  matt its pulling in theres the central section and the wall as you begin to move through it  begins to slowly pull in to close in towards you 
none	  laura can we freeze it can we cast cold on it or something  marisha can we move fast  matt moving quickly through its not moving rapidly as soon as you see this you begin to  dart through the only person who would be in danger is the very end caleb since youre at the  back i need you to make a dexterity saving throw for me because as all of you start darting  through and making your way theyre drifting and tangling in closer together  liam oh jeez it jumped up well thats 
none	 a six seven  matt okay as you move forward you feel a bit of it touch your shoulder and then it wraps around  and pulls you against the wall you guys hear this slamming behind theres a shift of water you  watch caleb get yanked towards the right side of the chamber its currently sucking the seaweed  begins to snake its way around caleb you take five points of poison damage and are grappled  liam mmhmm  travis can i send two shots of eldritch blast at the stuff around it the kelp  matt 
none	 sure ill say two attacks with disadvantage because youre having to aim them to try to keep  around him  taliesin im going to cast light really quickly too  matt okay the light fills the space  travis first ones a 19 and not a natural 20 but a 16  matt okay yeah both hit go ahead and roll damage  marisha bbblast  travis 12 and  marisha eldritch bbblast  travis 26 points of damage  matt okay each side both blasts of eldritch blast impact the sides of the cavern wall with a  
none	 dull thud the clusters of seaweed that currently wrap around caleb are torn to the point  where you have enough strength to pull yourself free breaking the grapple you shrug them off of  you as youre touching with your fingers your fingers spike with pain no additional poison  damage necessarily but you know staying would continue to do so  liam im poisoned  matt you are not poisoned you just took poison damage you manage to pull it away and catch up  with the rest of the crew you guys are heading towards the right 
none	 chamber which begins to rise up  a bit before leveling off about 15 feet above and about 20 feet ahead of you the walls are still  covered in this seaweed in chunks about every five or so feet you see another cluster and  theyre a bit scattered around the interior a large portion of this whole chamber network seems  to be housing this same type of plant  travis were going to move fast and im going to keep eldritch blast charged and if anything  starts to reach closer than other areas of it  
none	 matt make a perception check  sam youre good at this  laura im going to keep sacred flame prepped as well to release it then if anything gets attacked  matt okay so youre readying the spell  laura yeah its just a cantrip  matt yeah so youre fine  sam six  laura okay well get rid of it then  travis i drink out of that  matt okay jester you feel this like a burst of brain freeze for a second like something cold  tickles the inside of your head and its gone  
none	 laura this is weird  sam what happened  laura it felt like i drank a slurpee or something  matt caduceus you see something shadowy shift long down the hall up and above that barely catches  your attention before its gone  taliesin do i even have to bother or do i know what that is  matt you dont its not the same as before  taliesin its something different  matt from what you saw before it was giving a faint pale glow and had a ghostly presence to it  this is just a movement 
dung	 in dark shadow  taliesin oh then im going to do the eyes of the grave one more time the minute i see it theres  something else down here too  sam something else oh great  liam im feeling a little weary does anyone want to help me out a little bit  sam oh are you hurt caleb calebs hurt someone heal caleb  laura okay  taliesin youre going to take it  laura sure  liam yeah teamwork  travis yasha will  taliesin yasha can  matt yeah she has an ability  travis 
none	 if you want to save your stuff  taliesin yeah lets have yasha  laura yeah  travis yasha will heal caleb for seven hit points using healing hands  sam thanks ashley  liam what happened just now  travis seven points healing  liam okay  taliesin did you take your 17 earlier also  liam no  taliesin from prayer of healing  liam i didnt know that was for me  taliesin that was for everybody  laura and taliesin yeah  travis did you need the seven  liam cant do the math right now 
none	  marisha no  liam then im good  matt yeah so yasha holds onto that then  taliesin everyone was  liam i thought that was for one person  taliesin did a group thing  matt all right so continuing on  taliesin yeah theres something up ahead  sam im going to look for traps  matt all right go ahead and make a perception check to see if you notice anything strange about  the interior  sam 18 and a five  matt okay looking about the area it looks like a natural cavern you 
none	 dont see much that would  catch any some sort of dissembled or trap mechanism with a trigger  sam were fine come on  liam i can light it up in here if we want or do we want to  taliesin they know were here now  travis light it up  liam ja  travis yes  liam all right im going to put the string of globules up the passage  travis lets at least unrestrict caduceus  matt okay the globules appear like lights coming on segmented down a long hallway as the final one 
none	  glows right behind it you see the figure of a man looking at you white and pale who then steps  back into the wall and vanishes  laura oh this is really terrible  travis stammering into the wall  laura he was a ghost  sam while were looking at that ill take the seaweed that we used as camouflage before you  know the thing where you put an orange on your mouth im going to do that with seaweed  marisha eww  sam im going to look up at fjord and be like its 
none	 already got me ah  travis nah no big deal an improvement laughter  sam im hideous no hes right im hideous  travis okay thats the worst thing ive ever heard or seen did i recognize the face  matt no because youre the closest up there since youre helming it in with darkvision  darkvision wouldnt matter so much in this instance but the figure you saw looked to be male  wearing loose fitting clothing sunken eyes with no actual eyes inside the sockets pale with a  faint ghostly glow about their visage a line of 
none	 rope wrapped around one arm multiple loops it  just stared at you before stepping back into the wall and vanishing  travis god stop describing it  laughter  travis we go forward right yeah  taliesin yeah  laura do you really want this do you really want this orb though  travis its still in this direction right  laura nervous i dont know  liam at least so far they are not harassing us  travis yeah thats true more the plants than anything  laura did he look menacing the guy did he just look 
none	 like  matt no expression just blank and cold absent of any real emotion before it dissipated  travis yes well keep going forward  matt continuing down this path you climb or swim up the brief 15foot incline to get to the next  tunnel path where the orbs were spread out to continue you move through and the elements of  seaweed that were still in there are shifting from the water displacement ever so slightly as you  move through same order you guys are going through  sam sure  matt all right that being the 
none	 case as you push through i need caleb once again to make a  dexterity saving throw  liam expeditious retreat as a reaction  matt okay go for it ill let you do that  liam yep  matt all right you cast expeditious retreat you manage to dart forward and out of the grasping  hands of the seaweed through the use of your spell you catch up now darting forward through  everybody next to jester and fjord  marisha yeah you want to be in the middle  liam whatever ive got ten minutes of zip 
none	 baby lets go forward  matt okay there we are moving forward in that  taliesin just for fun im going to tap resistance on you well im just going to give  you if anything happens in the next minute you can add a d4 to any saving throw  matt okay following the tunnel down for another 15 to 20 or so feet it curves around to the left  do you continue and curve around the edge  travis mmhmm  matt you come around the corner and look you guys are at the front i need 
none	 jester and fjord to  make since you have the globes you can move the globes ahead if you want to  liam ill say that theyre 20 feet ahead of us and 20 feet behind  matt so you do not have disadvantage on your perception checks  laura 23  travis six  taliesin im going to take a perception check then  marisha its the same thing you rolled last time  travis i dont understand  matt well youre further back well get to you because theyre the ones at the front they get to  
none	 do this first  taliesin thats fair  matt but youre safer in the middle what did you get  laura 23  matt as you turn around the corner and look the path continues for another 20 or so feet in this  tunnel before it descends into a much larger chamber the seaweed gets thicker towards the  mouth of this chamber from the little bit of glowing orbs that begin to extend over that edge  that goes into it what little bit of light hits bits of gold coins scattered all throughout the  floor of 
none	 that next chamber  marisha dont touch them  travis do we dare steal a glance at the seaweed thats around are there also strips of cloth and  bone and body  matt yes they are but that center cluster seemed to have quite a few that were in there  these in the walls only have a few scattered pieces of parts no full bodies here in the hallway  laura less people made it this far  matt beau as youre coming around that corner and people are looking off to the side you glance  over 
dung	 your shoulder and see for a split second an older man with a curled and scraggly beard that  goes down to about midchest the eyes are missing you see vacant dark sockets the jaw is  slackjawed and open as it looks towards you i need you to make a charisma saving throw please  marisha oh fuck not what im great at dont fuck me gil 12 not good  matt it leans in towards you and not yet it leans in towards you and you feel this cold  sensation over your whole body your muscles lock 
dung	 in place and your consciousness goes dark out of  the corner of your eye you see some sort of ghostly movement you look over and see beau rest  into a standing position on her back foot  taliesin okay im going to turn undead really quickly and then im going to go over and deal  with you  matt whats the dc on that  taliesin the dc on turn undead is let me hit my  travis as shes resting on her back foot her eyes are open  matt eyes are open yeah  taliesin 
none	 thats a wisdom saving throw its right here so its why is it not saying these things  laura i dont know why doesnt yours have it  taliesin mines weird wisdom saving throw oh so is that my  matt whatever your spell dc is  taliesin oh 16  matt 16 no fails by one its a 14 plus one 15  taliesin fuck off ghost  matt being a specialist in undead and already preparing for the presence here you glance out of  the corner of your eye just in time to see the essence of 
none	 this spiritual form drift into beaus  body as you watch that moment of consciousness fade from her face as the presence of beau goes  cold and whatever was in this tunnel begins to come to the forefront you take your staff and  slam it into the ground this wave of light energy emerges it impacts all of you and the water gets  suddenly warm around you as it blows past beau you see strands of hair get blown back and with  that that same ghostly old man body jettisons out the back of her and 
none	 drags down the hallway into  darkness and disappears  taliesin not cool man not cool  marisha what just happened  sam shes back  marisha was i traci again  laura you had a ghost that just fell out of you are ghosts going to be trying to take over our minds  marisha caduceus did you just do that  taliesin yeah  marisha thank you  taliesin he was creepy man come on  laura have you had ghosts try to take you over before  taliesin yeah  laura whoa has it ever worked  
none	 taliesin not that i know of i hope i mean would you know  marisha i dont know do i know  matt you have an essence after what just happened that something weird happened and you lost yourself  travis i have a feeling that if these dead people invade our bodies theyre going to walk us into  the walls we should huddle together and keep a hand on each other if one of us stops moving  stop that person okay we need to move forward quickly  taliesin is it worth cutting through some of this 
none	 stuff  laura well i can use sacred flame on the ones in front of us and see if it will make it open in the opening  taliesin i can join you for that  travis yeah if its closed our way forward yes otherwise we should move quickly  matt as you guys are having this conversation you glance back in the tunnel where you came from  where caduceus had jettisoned that spirit back and at the very edge of the light you can see  about 12 or so of these ghostly figures standing there unmoving 
none	  laura why are they facing us i hate this fjord this is really terrible  taliesin lets find what were looking for and get out of here  sam keep going  travis with the hustle i mean on the hustle on the quick march  matt all right pushing towards and following the orbs gliding forward the mouth of this  entranceway before it opens up is where it looks like two larger clusters on each side of this  seaweed is through you are what  laura sacred flameing one of the clusters and hes going to 
none	 sacred flame the other cluster  matt they autofail saving throws theyre seaweed  laughter  taliesin thank you its been a long day  matt roll damage well see if its enough to clear the way for a moment you as well caduceus  laura four radiant damage  taliesin damage  laura 2d8  taliesin thats seven radiant damage  matt okay the side on caduceus edge of the wall you watch this blast of radiant energy  emanate from the side of the wall and blow out the center part some of the seaweed get released and 
none	  begins to scatter and float towards the top your side blasts but it doesnt quite tear all the way  through you guys begin darting forward on the right side caleb youre the first one there  liam has it been over ten minutes  matt no youre still expeditious retreat  liam yeah it lasts ten minutes  matt all right you dart inside the chamber ahead of everybody else youre now in the center of  this open chamber as you stop with the globes around you to take in the atmosphere the rest of  you 
none	 are now having to catch up yasha needs to make a dexterity saving throw as well  sam yasha  matt she gets advantage because she can see it because of her danger sense  travis okay thats right natural 20  laura oh for yasha  matt she just actually no she shoulder checks the seaweed and does not give a shit  marisha it works for yasha  travis as yasha no problem  matt you guys all begin to push forward this chamber is larger than what you came in through  its about 50 to 60foot 
none	 diameter continues in for about 80 or so feet and the height goes to  about 30 to 35 feet all the walls here are covered in this seaweed make a perception check  two of you who are helming the view on this  liam im already in there  matt thats true yeah you make one first  taliesin yeah well take it 23  liam 15  matt okay glancing around you can see areas where the seaweed is slowly shifting from the  movement of calebs expeditious retreat what was once still shifts and you can 
none	 see elements of the  stone wall behind it your eyes barely make out a handful of small carvings in the wall small runic  letters that are not in line but at angle sporadically carved at places but where the  seaweed moves over and blocks it  taliesin does my detect magic which i think is just barely still up i dont feel like this has  been a tenminute venture since that  matt yeah id say youre pushing the edge on this one  taliesin its not much longer i know  matt id say as 
none	 you step into this chamber are you heading to the center of it  taliesin no im just coming in and looking around  matt as youre standing at the mouth of this just past the edge you do not detect anything  particularly magical then as you take your first step into the chamber you see this you almost  run into it in the middle of this chamber there is a small twofoot pedestal and a disc a stone  disc about that wide and about two feet from edge to edge that is resting on it but 
none	 at an angle it  looks old it looks weathered and there appears to be a spiral of runes two sets of them that curve  inward around each other before merging in the center with one singular sigil where they meet  liam are these arcane glyphs or is this language  matt they are arcane glyphs if youd like to make an arcana check if you want to take a moment  to study  marisha is this our answer as to why this entire area eats ships  travis could be  laura is ukotoa here  
none	 travis no well  sam yes sort of  marisha its a temple  liam 24  sam its one of the three gates right  travis could be there would need to be a spot for an orb  marisha is this what vandren was going for  travis its not what i saw in my dream  matt these runes this whole incantation this enchantment or whatever that sits in this is old  precalamity age of arcanalevel magic it is dormant currently it looks like there is  something that is required to infuse this object with 
none	 power or to get it to use whatever its  enchantment is the more you look over it you realize the powers beyond anything youve cast  the nature of it seems to be conjuration and it seems to have a lot of the base runes that youve  used to manipulate fire youve used to manipulate earth its elemental in nature you continue to  look over it and get the sense that this is triggered by some sort of theres a physical  material that needs to be brought to this table or brought as part of this 
none	 ritual and in doing so  would conjure some sort of powerful elemental force  liam did i pick up on the fact that caduceus was looking at glyphs in the wall did i see those as well  matt no you did not  liam no okay  matt you do feel this faint cold brushing sensation at the back of your skull  laura what the fuck is that  taliesin i think its maybe time for another detect object ill take this one im going to  cast locate object  matt okay you cast locate object 
none	 focusing on  taliesin on the stone  matt you step forward and can see in the far back side of the chamber as you guys get a look  around clustered in with the base of the walls where the seaweed is thick you begin to see as  the light around the chamber comes to touch it and you see it first there are piles of salvaged  goods gold and silver dishware clusters of coins gold platinum copper silver all in  various levels of grime that have gathered on them but the shine still shows through 
none	 in places  you can see tools that were haphazardly pulled and gathered and jammed into pockets in the walls  its like a nightmarish ariels grotto almost you immediately realize that this is all things  that have been salvaged and pulled from all the ships that have sunk and brought in the floor  youve been stepping on thats been somewhat soft to the occasional crunch you glance down and  realize is just bones just hundreds of human and humanoid bones that have all been gently dusted  with the general sand and silt of the interior 
none	 of this chamber  marisha it feels like everything is being sucked to this location  travis 30foot ceiling right  matt there is a throne a chair of some kind that sits on the opposite side of the room thats at a  slight angle resting against the stone and you immediately know thats precisely where the object  you seek resides somewhere around or with that  taliesin its by the chair  laura theres a chair  travis how far away is it  marisha yeah what do you mean chair  matt you guys are standing 
none	 towards the entrance like the stairs and the decline that leads inside  calebs the only one thats actually in the center of the chamber by this table this thing that  youve been studying  laura where are the ghosts theyre just hanging out  matt you glance over your shoulder  laura yeah  matt about 15 feet behind you  yelling and groaning  matt not moving just looking at you  laura distressed yell  travis were being herded thats great  liam what you told me was that studying this thing it seems to require 
dung	 elements to set it in  motion how did you describe it  matt as youre getting closer because the arcana is not an immediate thing its a slow process of  study theres a heavy elemental conjuring that this is capable of doing its very old primal  magic looking at the stone the stains and the interior of these ruins there is distinctly a  dark brown tint to elements of this table  sam some might say amber  matt as you scrape some of it with your fingernail it flakes off it has a consistency  
none	 youre familiar with that of a coagulated blood  sam ooh  matt caduceus as youre looking over towards the throne you look up and about ten feet above the  throne standing up in the seaweed holding onto the clusters of it you see a female humanoid form  mostly in shadow hair down over the front of the face one yellow eye peeking through on this side  and one halfopen yellow eye glancing through up against the wall  taliesin shes right above the throne  marisha the song her hungry eye its in her fucking head 
none	  matt you watch as she scrambles across the side of the wall behind the seaweed and is gone  sam shes gone  laura marisha and travis yelling no  matt lets roll initiative  yelling  liam it is the ring  laura oh my god were fighting the grudge ill throw up  marisha natural 20  taliesin 19 plus one so thats 20  laura woo i got 20 as well  taliesin oh fuck  laura just two clerics at 20  sam this sucks  travis oh shit what  laura and marisha whoa 
none	  sam two map night  travis oh fuck  taliesin fuck this is so much worse than i was imagining  sam where are we  liam theres the throne over there  matt this is the chamber youre in right now this is the entrance  travis hey look we picked the right way to go  matt yeah you did  travis what was in the other ones  taliesin an encounter  matt so caleb you are up against here the rest of you are just coming down the entrance this way  tell me whereabouts 
none	 you were placed around the base  marisha fuck thats tiny  laura i feel like i would still be on the stairs because i was looking back at the ghosts  matt thats true ill put you and caduceus kind of up towards the top there you guys are back here  marisha id have been near fjord probably  matt yeah so youll be up here with the rest of them the shape you saw up in this direction  before it vanished  sam shes just a little thing  liam so is nott the brave  
none	 travis why would you even say that to the dm you know how much shit he has back there  sam yeah its just one person  laura stop it  sam didnt look like she even had any weapons  travis did you ever see cabin in the woods do you know how bad this is going to get  matt dashilla rolled really good initiative so whos up first 25 to 20  marisha 24  laura 20  taliesin 20  sam whoa  travis beau jester and cad both have 20s  laura no beau had

none	 it  matt beginning of this round the only person thats seen this entity is caduceus  taliesin i cant see them anymore  matt no they seem to have shifted into this thick forest of seaweed that tends to wrap around  all the walls of this chamber beau youre up first  marisha i dont see anything i look around  matt you can use your action to try and perceive if you want to  marisha i go caduceus then i look around and see if i see anything  matt okay so you use the search 
none	 action roll a perception check  marisha whispering god fucking bullshit eight  matt eight unfortunately no you look around the vicinity and glancing up around and you see  movement from the water thats being disturbed but no sight of any particular entity  marisha i move towards caleb and kind of bodyguard him i am going to take the patient  defense yeah that works im going to take the patient defense  matt okay bonus action to patient defense  marisha action yep  matt okay that finishes beaus turn caduceus and jester you guys can decide

none	 can take care of that  matt suddenly tearing through the seaweed on the upper wall you see this figure emerge now this  pale aquagreen skin thats bulbous and strangely proportioned these long clawed hands as the  hair pulls back you can see where would be a humanoid face instead are these protracted almost  anglerfishtype teeth that come out of the front with no nose and the yellow eyes gleaming from  underneath shes going to look straight down at you caleb  laura no  matt i need you to make a wisdom saving throw for 
none	 me please  liam another one oh good  marisha my bodyguarding doesnt do shit stop looking at him  matt natural one as she looks shes still up in the air swimming looking at you mouth opens  and you feel the deepest most horrifying fear well up inside you your heart stops and you drop  to zero hit points  travis oh my fucking god  matt you guys watch caleb go creaking and start drifting there unconscious  sam oh fuck  matt dashilla now hovering in the space is going to move over she moves 
none	 over to the side of  the wall here still visible now jumping and using and holding onto the seaweed like its a  tether all right  liam really could have used that periapt right about now  travis the what  matt the periapt that ends her turn fjord youre up  travis is she visible  matt shes visible shes up on the wall on this side  taliesin i got this ive got him  matt remember you guys are still underwater aside from fjord youre all half speed  travis yeah okay  liam oh

none	 there looking down at you the murkiness of the nearby waters in the  movement begins to form around her and almost try and claw at her throat like the shadows  themselves are trying to pull at her clavicle  travis i will gather two eldritch blasts in my hands and fire them both at her  matt roll two attacks  taliesin with extra d4s on both  travis yes thank you one is a natural 20  matt yeah it is  travis the other is a 17 plus four for a 21  matt both hit 
none	 you dont even need the d4s on that roll damage on the critical first  travis i roll an extra d6 for the hex okay so the critical first 1d10 plus four thats a one  matt so two but roll the d6 which is also doubled  travis thats a six  matt so 12 so thats 14 plus your  travis plus four  matt thats 18 points of damage on that one and damage for the second one  travis is a nine plus four 13 five 18 points of damage  matt well look at that 
dung	 36 points of damage on a cantrip and a hex thats how warlocks are done  so as shes up there as the hex constrains around her both eldritch blasts hit from both blasts  theres these dark scar marks on the upper torso and one off the shoulder where they impact the  head curls up and creaking back in your direction the eyes seem to bulge angrily toward you  travis uhhuh  matt does that end your turn  travis yes it does  matt okay at the end of your turn shes going to use one 
none	 of her legendary actions to use forced  vision at some point during this adventure as she was trailing you throughout the cavern and  watching from a distance she ensorceled a number of your members of the party you being one of them  marisha she what  laura that was the cold thingies  travis was she invisible  matt she was hiding through all the seaweed and no one was rolling high enough perception to see  her you saw her move once because she didnt roll high enough stealth on that one  marisha what the 
none	 fuck is about to happen  travis and this is forced vision  matt correct you are not immediately in melee with anybody but shes going to force you to  move you glance all of a sudden you see her out of the corner of your eye shes not there  anymore shes off there you rush in her direction after her compelled to move over this  side right up against the wall between the wall and beau you get there and shes gone you look  back and she never left you shake your head for a 
none	 second thats one legendary action done next  turn is nott  sam i will move to the left my left near that pillar thing yeah and bonus action hide behind it  matt okay you move over there so bonus action hide  sam shit not great 16  matt 16 hits  sam no 16 thats the hide  matt sorry thats right yeah  sam i dont know if that hides me enough is that  matt you dont know youll find out  sam okay and i will attack  matt all right so you dart 
none	 from behind and fire  sam i shoot at a 25 or something like that  matt that indeed hits and she didnt roll very well for perception so you do get sneak attack on this  sam all right yeah okay  laura yeah thats good  sam 21 plus five is  laura singing 26  sam plus fury of the small is another seven right is that that works now  matt 33  sam yeah 33  matt so darting from the side and letting the bubbles go by she is within 30 feet of you 
none	 so  you do not have the disadvantage it catches her in the chest and her hands go forward and she  leans out of the seaweed for a second to pull it out and let it fall as it slowly begins to drift  down sinking into the chamber before reaching back up into the seaweed and holding on to it  sam that is not sanitary  travis does she take poison damage  matt no she is immune to the effect of the seaweed  sam that makes a little sense  travis unfortunate unfortunate  matt 
none	 so is that your turn  sam thats my turn ive done everything  matt all righty finishing notts go yashas up yasha is frightened  travis she will rage with her bonus action and no longer be frightened or charmed  matt she can do that  travis doesnt rage break  matt nah i think thats a thing that berserkers got  tarvis oh really  matt ill double check  travis it might have been might have been some old shit  matt yeah thats mindless rage its sixth level path of the berserker its a little 
none	 grog bleeding  in there  travis sorry old shit  matt all good  travis she will definitely not move any closer to dashilla where is yasha shes right there  wheres caleb  matt caleb is over there  travis can she  laura if she stays within 15 feet of me then shes anyone within 15 feet of me is protected  by my unicorn dragons  travis from what from scary face  taliesin from being attacked physically  laura from being attacked they get attacked if they get near you  travis where is jester 
none	 standing  matt jesters right here shes technically up on the stair right there  travis okay i got you can yasha use her 20 feet to move to caleb  matt ill say for the purposes of ease there jester is up on that stair there  travis 20 feet to move to caleb which shouldnt be any closer to dashilla  matt nope up on top of this platform or off to the side  marisha theres a platform  matt theres a little raised section in the center there  travis sure platform sounds good and she 
none	 will use her handy heal thing to pump seven points of  healing into caleb  taliesin did she get tapped in the head by the way since we are running her  travis yasha didnt not that i remember  matt no  laura i did fjord did and  matt caleb did  laura and travis caleb did  taliesin fuck  travis so caleb gets six hit points as an action healing hands  liam on top of seven or six total  travis seven total  liam seven total so i got that  travis does

none	  travis okay lets do it anyway  matt okay so she goes into a rage  travis and thats her turn  matt all right that ends yashas go at the end of yashas turn its going to use another  legendary action to use forced vision on you fjord i need you to go ahead and make a melee  attack against beau as you glance around and suddenly shes right there in front of you and  you take your falchion swing out to try and take her out  marisha has disadvantage because i have patient 
none	 defense  matt yep so you have disadvantage on the strike  travis okay thats good  matt but you do have plus d4s to each of the hits because of bless  travis oh shitballs thats at two plus eight is ten  matt plus a d4  travis plus a d4 is  marisha he misses  travis is 14  matt yeah  matt sword whoosh you duck out of the way what the hell  marisha dick  travis im like i dont know  marisha confused noises  matt all right that ends yashas turn

none	 runes just sitting there in the chamber  liam thems the breaks thems the breaks  matt thats your turn all right back at the top beau youre up  marisha spellcasters suck  matt actually at the end of calebs turn  travis how many legendary actions does she have  matt she has three shes going to use her last one shes going to go ahead and use shifting  speed so shes going to move her speed without triggering opportunity attacks  background music  sam oh a fast swimmer a regular michael phelps  matt actually 
none	 she can move ten more feet so right there  sam oh my god  travis a 50foot swim  matt yep as you watch she skitters across the wall grabbing the seaweed and using it almost  tarzanlike to thrust herself forward grabbing onto this bit rolling and then swimming around  and is now floating in the air or floating in the water right next to where caduceus is standing  beau what are you doing  marisha how many feet is she  matt from you right now  marisha yeah counting  matt 30 feet from

none	  travis was that a matrix reference  marisha well uh you know like the  laura go  marisha is this at disadvantage  matt yes because you are underwater still  marisha thats four yeah probably not 11  matt the first strike as you come forward this is the first time you get a really good look at  the face of this terrible creature and as soon as you come towards the mouth opens up and you  barely hold back from the punch and that just gives it enough time to shift out of the 
none	 way and  it just hits water  marisha one more okay 22  matt that hits you know now that 15 is the armor class  travis can i say for the hex wisdom ability checks disadvantage  matt wisdom ability checks got it  marisha nine  matt nine nine points of damage as the first one misses and pulls away youre like nope  whack and then right across the jaw cracking sound cold and hard theres a toughness to her  marisha boney  matt all right does that finish your turn beau  marisha yep 
none	  matt all right caduceus and jester youre up  taliesin you want to go  laura sure  matt she did technically move around and wouldve passed through your 15foot radius by the way  laura oh  matt so she does have to make a wisdom saving throw a five plus one six so thats a failure  go ahead and roll damage for your  laura spirit guardians  matt spirit guardians yes  laura yay  travis seahorses  laura seahorse unicorns hold on wheres my other where the fuck are my d8s  sam you

none	 you the initiative just before the lair action hits  because youre all on 20 go for it  laura im going to step forward so im within 15 feet of her so they can try to attack her again  matt on her turn all right  sam bloop  laura an affected creature when you cast the spell what  matt technically the creatures movement is halved when it moves through  laura an affected creatures is halved in the area yes  matt it only barely skimmed the side so it would have lost five foot of 
none	 movement so well say that  dashilla is there  laura okay and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn  there so if i move towards it wouldnt it enter the area  matt no youre entering hers she has to enter your area however at the start of her turn it triggers  laura okay then im going to move within 15 feet of her and then as a bonus action im going to  cast spiritual weapon at 4thlevel  matt ooh boy  travis is that 
none	 the first time  laura mmhmm so thats a little spiritual lollipop with giant serrated blades coming out of it  matt so where are you putting it  laura right in front of her face  matt like right here let her do it  laura is it okay  taliesin no yeah no my opinions are weird  laura and its going to attack her  matt go ahead and roll an attack  laura whoa thats a natural 19 so i think that hits  matt yes it does go ahead and roll damage on that  
none	 laura whoa double eights  matt well you cast it at 4thlevel you said right thats 3d8  laura really  matt because its 2ndlevel normally each level you put on top of that  marisha you get an additional die  laura really  matt yeah for every spell level ahead of two you get another so 16 plus one more d8  laura seven  matt all right so thats 23  travis 24  matt no 23 double eights is 16 plus seven is 23  laura 23 plus four  matt yeah because of your wisdom 
none	 so 27 points of damage whack the serrated edge of the  lollipop grinds into her as it does black blood spills out from the wound of the chest the shreds  of seaweed and cloth pulling off from the front exposing the sunken rib cage where the flesh is  pulled taut against and now the wound itself is open and spilling this trail of cloudy black blood  in the water  laura for my action im going to cast sacred flame  sam that was your bonus action  matt yep sacred flame is a cantrip so 
none	 go for it thats wisdom or dexterity  laura dexterity save  matt dexterity save that is going to be an 18  laura damn it okay  matt but that was a nice round  travis dude get the fuck out  matt all right finishing up jesters turn caduceus  taliesin motherfucking dexterity save thats some bullshit  matt you just watched her dart over you essentially ten feet up above scoot past land  and then both jester and beau converge and start pummelling her in the hallway  marisha im just punching the shit out of 
none	 her while surrounded by rainbow sea horses and a  bladed lollipop this is awesome  matt welcome to dungeons  dragons  taliesin im going to also do this im going to do a sacred flame  matt okay dexterity save that is going to be a 14 i dont believe that  taliesin that does not because its a 16  matt yep so go ahead and roll damage on that  taliesin and thats nine points of radiant damage  matt nine points of radiant damage nice spell impact angry snarl  taliesin i dont like the

none	 your turn the lair  action kicks in clouded waters now you watch as the silt the muck and the bones all of a sudden  begin to swirl up into the waters around you and obscure the area the entire lair is now  considered heavily obscured you cannot see more than five feet in front of you  sam whoa  matt its now dashillas turn she gets her legendary actions back  sam hey she cant see us  background music  matt oh shes not affected by the obscurity this is her lair  taliesin she 
none	 starts 15 feet within  matt she does so immediately she has to take the spirit guardians  laura and shes hexed on wisdom  matt wisdom ability checks not saving throws otherwise hex would be super powerful but she  still rolls a 4  laura yay  matt so do full damage  laura that doesnt count because it slipped out  sam it was not intentional  matt okay  laura i rolled lower anyway i wanted to be fair 13  matt 13 points of radiant damage blasted again as this cluster of vibrant glowing almost

none	 from each you take from the first strike 12 points of slashing  damage the second one 14 points of slashing damage in what already was clouded silt is now  clouded further by your own blood from the slash marks across the front and the side of your neck  and jaw and the pain sears through in an instant all you see is the claws streaking  through and the glowing yellow eyes before they rescind back into the cloud  taliesin no attack of opportunity  matt well no shes going to attempt to move back make 
none	 an attack of opportunity with disadvantage  marisha yeah nope  travis fucking gil  matt with that she vanishes into  liam the murk its just physical crap filling the water  matt yeah just all over thats going to go ahead and end dashillas turn fjord youre up  travis am i coherent am i awake and alive  matt yes  travis thats cool good  matt youre a bit shaken by all these visions that keep creeping into your head  travis wow i only remember where i kind of last saw her  matt yes

none	 start studying the runes on the  walls to see how they contribute to this mystery  matt okay make an arcana check  liam this gets the d4  taliesin checks no saves and attacks  liam 14  matt its hard to pick up the details of these particular runes they seem of a similar age as  the ones you saw on the table but its not the same enchantment you pick up that they are placed  there for some reason but youre unable to ascertain what it is unfortunately  liam on a whim im 
none	 going to use a 2ndlevel spell slot to cast comprehend language instantly  to see if anything becomes clearer and i have to touch the table and touch the walls to do that  matt right okay it is not a language per se these arent passages or language being  transmitted these are runes of some kind they are used to channel something  they may or may not be connected to the table altar in the center  liam what are we doing here fjord  travis can i hold up the sphere in one hand and the 
none	 falchion in the other  matt yeah  travis do they react to each other  matt they both get brighter  travis can i try and hold the sphere to my chest  matt yes you may as you take the sphere and press it to your chest your eyes suddenly flash  images of black subocean darkness the same place your dreams have brought you over and over again and  that bright yellow light emerges breaking the shadow and there you see the yellow eye with two  more on the sides of it you see the 
none	 endless row of teeth that curves into the smile and the  flash is gone and you look down and your hand is empty the rest of you watched this thing  momentarily seem to become either ethereal or it is absorbed into fjords chest you look at the  sword and now theres the eye in the hilt and the eye in the pommel  laura thats tight  travis ooh hotness mmm lets kill this bitch and get the fuck out of here  laura do we need to kill her you have what you came for  
none	 travis sure we can let her go  liam we should go shes not going to follow us to the surface  laura lets get some platinum before we leave though what what  travis this pedestal are we going to just leave it  laura what difference does it make  liam what are your goals your goal is what to  travis i was only curious about the orb but it just seems so  liam you know what avantika talked about you know what she wanted you think this has nothing  to do with that  
none	 travis the temple i was in before had a recessed spot for the sphere that just seems like a rune  right like a symbol  liam yeah but if that was some sort of lock you want to put the key in that lock  travis no  liam do you feel any different  travis i do not yeah we can get out of here just on our guard as we go  laura yeah on our guard of course  matt while youre beginning to initiate the looting process what are you doing caduceus  taliesin i 
none	 am basically holding ready to shoot a bolt at anything that moves and i was actually  hanging a little bit far down just in case one of them drops i can heal and somewhere where im  not going to get attacked by kelp and im keeping very aware  matt okay well you were staying over in this chamber with them nott and beau you are in the  central chamber now do you want to search for the possible whereabouts of dashilla  marisha i want to look around and then i want to head towards that

none	  dashilla is still present it seems or something moving through the seaweed as a cover behind it  like a curtain which path do you choose  marisha i turn to nott and say are we still fighting this thing  sam what i dont see anything where  marisha shes this way i move that way  matt which way  marisha towards wherever i saw her  matt you saw her move in the direction of this fork  marisha of this side fork right  matt this side you saw her move in this direction you

none	 up inside but these all have these wounds of their throats slit from side  to side  marisha oh sacrifice style  matt theyre all in various states of decomposition the freshest one maybe months ago  and the sea has caused its own unique form of bloating and sloughing off of the various parts of  the skeleton  marisha gross  sam is she in here do we see any movement  matt you can make another perception check  taliesin i would have made my way a little bit further  marisha all of us  
none	 sam 11  marisha ooh that was almost a natural 20 instead its a five  matt glancing inside and taking a moment to really look around theres no other movement  sam other way  marisha sure  matt you guys shift around  sam cast a quick message we went on the other one now  matt as you turn around to the other side there you see standing there another pale gaunt spirit  looking right at you  marisha go fuck a ghost i punch it  liam im going to go fuck a ghost

none	  background music  liam im always curious can i count on you to return the favor  travis always  liam slicing slamming  matt okay you suffer three points of damage as you place your hand down on it you see this dull  red glow around the hand thats placed on the table as you begin to pull your hand up and look  the runes where the blood has splattered have begun to give a faint glow  travis mmhmm  liam has anything changed with the ones on the walls  matt make a perception 
none	 check  liam okay ive rolled ass all night and a natural 20  matt you glance over and you can see a faint matching dull red glow on one of the runes across  the way just barely peeking through some of the gently shifting seaweed looking down at this  table you need a lot of blood to continue to do this  laura no youll kill yourself  marisha we saw a pile of corpses  travis i put my  matt how much damage are you willing to take guys  liam about nine more

none	 another rune and the rune low sounds its almost full the table isnt there yet you  have about twothirds to threequarters or so the room itself now is beginning to generally have a  red hue to it as each of these runes is beginning to fill the area  taliesin whispering this is such a bad idea  laura to you caleb six points  liam thank you  laura 12 points healed to you fjord  travis okay is there a chance that were giving this to her  liam im following your lead here this is

none	 you  stumble but you hit the surface of the water and it feels like ground  taliesin lets walk to the ship  travis we were hundreds of feet under water  taliesin thats why i made sure to pack some stuff just in case lets get out of here that  place gives me the creeps  laura and dashilla lives to keep being a legend  taliesin to keep pouring blood on well  laura thats true  marisha i am deeply curious as to what the fuck happened  matt you guys can see the squalleater

none	 travis we would have been walking for a long time  marisha all of that as to why are there are fucking ships at the bottom of the ocean  matt at least there would have been a hell of a skill challenge to get the squalleater out of the  center of that storm as you barely skirt the outside of this growing storm with enough  foresight and speed to not be caught in the brunt of it well end tonights game  travis as a point of order you were right we were supposed to head here
