none	 tonights episode of critical role  dramatic music  matt welcome back everyone so you all right jon  taliesin hes jacking in  sam hes jacking in  matt and the lavas connected welcome back jon glad you could join us again  cheering  matt all righty so picking up where we left off last time vox machina had just completed their  adventure in the distant countryside of wildmount interfacing with the darrington family and  apparently their longacquired debt with the myriad a criminal syndicate on that side of the  world after making a deal 
tavern	 that would salvage elements of the darrington family you made your  way back and encountered a halforc bardbarian by the way of lionel who was there on behest of his  boss aes adon or as you were immediately referred to as the meat man immediately you  were brought to a nearby tavern in whitestone where the vicinity had been rented out entirely  and you met with a large intimidatinglooking gentleman scarred pockmarked ready to go ahead  and wheel and deal some business with you after some interesting conversation and some sly  insights by vexahlia 
none	 and keyleth it was discovered that the meat man was indeed your old  compatriot scanlan under an illusion to attempt to notify you that hed discovered something quite  dangerous on his side of exandria you discovered that this fantastic bardbarian lionel had been  working for him under his meat man guise in ankharel for the better part of a year and while  set on a mission with a number of other compatriots of his lionel had stumbled upon an  area called the smouldercrown a mountain range not terribly far from ankharel what seemed to  
none	 be a cavern structure that led to an underground pyramid similar to the ziggurat that you guys had  been keeping an eye on underneath whitestone which also contained its own small black spherical  orb in which they were feeding magical items towards it looked like however they were  discovered in that tunnel and lionel was the only one to escape with his life the rest fell behind  and were left for dead upon notifying scanlan or the meat man of this information he knew it  was pertinent to return and get this to you in 
none	 person after which apologies were made some  were accepted some were not but it was generally decided by the team that based on this  information you needed to make your way to ankharel posthaste and discover what exactly  resides beneath the mountains of the smouldercrown you gathered up the following moment well rested  all met up at the base of the sun tree in the center of the square and thats where we left  off so as youve gathered your materials your weapons your armor what you think you may need  for this trek 
none	 youve all gathered around the base of the sun tree some shade has been thrown but  you have gathered so what do you wish to do  sam weve gone through the sun tree or not  laura no were right outside the sun tree just before weve left whitestone  taliesin i just want to make a point that ive alerted everybody in the government everybody  reasonable where were going why were going and that there should be people watching the  ziggurat underneath whitestone 247 while were on this mission  anything happens be prepared for 
none	 anything  laura youre so brilliant darling  marisha i dont understand theres not a lot of shade its noon  taliesin weve been throwing it its not here  liam thrown from a distance  laura i think we should probably head out  marisha yeah yeah where in ankharel  laura where are we going scanlan again shadowy mountain  marisha do i know anyplace thats near  matt youve been to ankharel youve been around quite a bit and youve seen a number of trees  the city itself within the walls through magical means or otherwise 
none	 there is an interior oasis  within the city itself there is the sand and dust that blows in from the outside desert that  surrounds it in marquet but there are a number of ponds and rivers and large palm trees and other  types of trees that are risen there are small clusters that form almost minute forests  throughout the city whether they be a park to wander through or a means of harvesting whatever  the trees have to offer for the people that live there but youve seen a number of trees and its  
none	 easy enough to make your way there  marisha okay ill do the oasis  matt okay as keyleth reaches out lionel you watch as the small halfelf redheaded girl  reaches out and touches the tree and suddenly the trunk splits open at the base and you watch as  what seems to be a glowing doorway of divine energy appears  marisha go go six seconds go go go  taliesin i help shove  sam i should note that doty is coming with us as well  liam hey quickly  laura sure ill note that trinket 
none	 is coming as well even though its a fucking given  liam i shove my sister through the tree  travis warming up  laura i mean just kidding i love you tary  liam youre not here i just shoved you through the tree i made it up i created it right there  on the fly  travis we all go through the tree yeah  all yeah  matt after an incredibly long wellstretched six seconds you all eventually make your way through  the doorway into the center of ankharel the temperature difference is stark its 
dung	 immediate  whereas you had a gradual transition to ankharel last time you were there going from the  whitestone colder more damp climate to the immediate dry heat of the central marquet desert  is just immediate its uncomfortable it may be comfortable for some of you and your mouth  immediately dries out for a moment and you have to adjust to the new atmosphere looking around  you youve emerged from the outside of one of the central oases which is kind of near the lux run  where you originally entered the city there you see 
none	 the streets are bustling and busy its  starting to get closer to later in the evening now on this part of exandria you can see the  skys starting to get a little darker theres an element of dusk that will probably be setting in  about an hour but here you are  laura well scanlan  jon why didnt we do this before its so much faster why did we take a 500day journey  sam it was just ten days first of all  jon again i dont get days why dont we just make that 
none	 tree open up  sam i am very powerful but theres some things that i cant do all right ever since you found  out i was short youre much snappier and snippier with me  jon youre just much smaller i mean i didnt realize  why dont you just go back to looking like aes  sam maybe i should  travis maybe you should  sam yeah because im known around these parts so that would probably be better  laura does aes wear this stupid headband because its really fucking distracting  jon what headband  
none	 matt perfect  sam ill put on the hat and become the meat man  matt so you step off to the side to a point where youre not being noticed and take on once again  the illusory facade of the meat man stepping out into the sunlight once more you see the imposing  figure of the meat man now amongst you  laura youre so scary and big do you have a place that you always stay  sam i have many places  laura thats what i figured  liam i try sticking my fingers through 
none	 the fake head a little bit  sam get off get off stop it  jon no wonder you said hands off  laura you didnt touch him this entire year  jon he always said hands off no matter how many times i tried  ashley you never went to brothels or anything like that then i guess  taliesin probably not together  marisha have you been hugged in a year has anyone given you a hug i give him a hug  jon are you trying to go through me to him  marisha no im just 
none	 giving you a hug  jon that gives me like 50 extra attack points or something right i feel like something cool  when someone hugs me  marisha can i use my inspiring leader feat  matt if you would like to take a moment to give everyone hugs  as part of your inspiring leader sure  marisha you know what guys  sam oh shes speeching  marisha human contacts important you know so come on come on lets all group hug group hug  taliesin no no  jon can i hug everybody else  sam 
none	 the meat man does not hug  travis this is a tenminute huddle  matt its a tenminute like hug it out  laura ten minutes is so awkward  matt i know and not in keyleths bailiwick at all  travis are we attracting any awkward looks  laura i feel like i would have abstained from the tenminute group hug  taliesin i would have brought you into it  marisha i keep trying to grab vex come on come on hug it out  matt so you brought scanlan and tary for this  sam yes  
town	 matt are they both  sam scanlan stepped out tarys in  matt so everyone except for scanlan gets 17 temporary hit points  laura thanks kiki no no no percy brought me in  marisha brought her out of her comfort bubble  matt as you all slowly begin to realize the slight display youve given in the center of the  town especially those of you in your darker heavier leathers  amongst this very warm open air  laura oh i thought we knew we were going to ankharel so we dressed for it thats what we 
none	  said the last episode  matt did you  laura thats what you said actually you said you all showed up dressed for ankharel  liam my armor is fire set  matt okay ill trust you on that  laura i feel like you said it  matt you wouldve its fine but its less the attire youre still wearing your armor i assume  laura yes yes yes  matt so youre still in heavy leathers  liam yeah were just doing the whole lawrence of arabia  matt so youre still a display of people in 
town	 heavy leather hugging for ten minutes in the  middle of this open thoroughfare  liam yeah were still very awkward at all times  matt so its not like all of a sudden theres a crowd gathered around you but occasionally  theres a few merchants across the way that are like so anyway as i was saying  liam bidet  laura be pleased  matt be pleased  travis you guys are all saying it wrong i dont know why vax can pick it up its not that hard  liam i am very smart  laura 
none	 where do we go  sam come with me  matt you watch as the meat man leads you down four or five different streets dodging through a  couple of alleyways and off onto the southerneastern side of ankharel there is a  modestlooking tobacco shop that is in a poorer district its a little rundown rundown  compared to a lot of ankharel which is pretty colorful and very wellkept so its pretty decent  average fare for emon considered the poorer side of ankharel but you laughs  sam was that a fart  matt its one 
none	 of the various beasts of burden that youre walking past in the streets of  ankharel fart sound  laura that was awesome  matt to be fair sometimes the slayers cakes get a little  liam theyre rich  laura were working out the ingredients  matt adventurers cant get it right all the time so you come to this modest tobacco shop as you  lead them into the interior one of your employees doran who is a rather scrawnylooking  boy maybe of 22 23 completely shaved head tanned skin a little sallow but hes sitting  
town	 there balancing a long thin almost like a railroadspiketype metal rod hes just kind of  balancing it over the wood and as soon as the door opens he fumbles  ah aes it is a pleasure to have you back  sam how are things in my absence  matt they have been well youve only been gone for a few hours but theyve been uneventful  sam oh yes yes thats right yes any new reports of the hooded people  matt none within the town not since last oh hi lionel  jon hey whats up  
none	 matt its good to see you anyway  laughter  jon you want a hug it makes you like superstrong  matt really  jon yeah at least thats what i  sam no fraternizing  matt but anyway and he reaches down and pulls a small wooden lever and its like you see hes  having to struggle with it and as he does so you hear the scraping of wood and a chainwinch  going you watch as one of the small furrows in the back corner slowly lifts up and reveals a  narrow staircase that leads 
none	 down into a subterranean area  liam this is kind of cool  jon its really awesome you guys should we should go this is like our cool hideout  marisha what was the guys name again  matt doran  marisha doran  travis doran you known aes long  matt for a number of months yes  travis yeah good guy  matt we dont converse often but he pays well and the work is the work is very rewarding  travis right does he have a firm handshake  matt stammers  travis you should find out 
none	 yeah no shake his hand no go ahead right now  matt i do not presume to want to i mean unless you would want to  sam no  matt okay yes i am sorry i do not mean to  travis in his custom no means yes i crave it deeply  matt make a deception check  taliesin your voice got really high during that  travis oh shit  laura whatd you roll whatd you roll  travis 19  matt 19 laughs uh i mean if you  travis known him for years really  
none	 sam i will just walk by him and go down into the hideyhole  matt okay i think you have some incorrect intel my friend  travis no i think youre probably gonna need a new job pretty soon that was a diss its all  right just look elsewhere thats all im saying  matt he sits back on his stool and takes his little rod and jams it into the wood and huffs as  you guys all make your way down there which both lionel and grog you guys have to cannonball up  real tight to 
dung	 make it through the corridor you drag your way through by pulling on the little  bits of wood and earth that mark the exterior walls of this descending staircase the smell is  musty its not damp but you can sense that there is a smell of tobacco you thought oh this  tobacco shops a front as you go down you see about ten feet down there is a large storage room  that contains barrels of dried tobacco of all sorts and has a very rich pungent but also like  a nice spice scent to it 
tavern	 in places spice ah you lead them on down to the far end of the hallway  there is another door that is locked you pull out a set of keys unlock it open it it leads down  another hallway and then eventually what looks to be some smaller sets of barracks rooms you see a few  doors that are ajar and empty with some beds inside you lead down another 20 or so feet to  another chamber and as it opens up inside you can see there are three tables arranged in a  triangular pattern 
dung	 and at the far end of the table there is a single what looks like a  thronelike chair its very wellcrafted its goldleafed in places it has intricate scrolling  on the sides and where the armrests are and there you see an individual with a hooded cloak and a  deep bluishpurple color with what looks like a red crimson slash design around the back a number  of jewelry and theyre facing away speaking towards the chair for there on the chair sits an  identical large looming human male with long dark hair and mustache pockmarked 
none	 skin and is  midconversation  laura you guys really should plan this out better  sam bit of warning dont use her name all right so ill just walk up to them  matt you walk up to the two of them  sam yeah sure  matt all right the cloaked figure is in the middle of conversation and speaking marquesian  which you understand to the effect of weve been looking and apparently all the shipments have  been diverted and held off until and hears the footsteps and turns over and sees you oh  confused 
none	 sounds  laura clears throat twins funny  liam what are the odds  matt deception check  laura motherfuck oh you know like 11  matt i um begins to pull a small blade out to the side i am under the impression that perhaps  one of you is a doppelganger and whoever my boss is would you please raise your hand  sam i do not raise my hand  matt the other one does aes what do we do and puts the blade forward and you watch as the  other meat man on the throne 
none	 just says we do nothing i know this man and we will do our  business tell no one what you saw here but if two more leave i have been taken by its will and  youll have to kill us both im just kidding thats a complete joke but no seriously you  really go go and the  jon should i go kill him  sam no no  matt the person with the cloak kind of  jon its fine i wont kill you  matt thank you be pleased and darts out of the room 
none	 real fast the other meat man on the  throne goes oh verath im gonna work real hard to try and convince him other of that  sam sorry about that  matt clears throat it is all right  laura good to see you again  matt good to see you as well you all look spry you look alive  sam is anyone in the room now matt besides  matt besides you guys no its just you guys and lionel  sam all right so we can drop all of the illusions they all know whats going 
dung	 on now  matt looks earnestly at lionel  sam even chod  jon lionel  matt aye very well and you watch as the meat man on the throne suddenly diminishes into a  smaller gnome figure as well only female with short almost buzzed sides of her dark brunette  hair that poofs into a curl there you can see shes also much tanner than you remember she is  wearing what looks to be a leather tunic thats straining against her rather large muscles for a  small gnome it looks like shes been making sure that 
none	 nobody messes  with her while shes in the city  laura shit is she buff now  matt shes pretty buff  laura shit  marisha you got a haircut i love it  matt you know the hot weather around here is a bit of a bitch this time of the year so best to  get it taken care of anyway what the fuck are you all doing here  sam i went to get them to tell them about the thing that we found  matt right okay great  sam i was going to escort 
none	 them there do you think you have things handled if we go for a day  matt oh thats fine ive only been dealing with this for the past two and half weeks without  you just fine no ones noticed until you came up inside looking the same as me thats great  sam sorry i didnt know you were throning  marisha throning  travis yeah is that a thing  sam well when were in command yeah  matt its not called throning dont listen to him  laura how long have you been here  matt 
none	 been here ankharel ive lost track of time better part of maybe eight months nine months  travis weve heard youve risen through the ranks very successful you are  matt not too bad if i do say so myself  travis well done  matt this ones almost ruined us a few times  travis thats not surprising  liam how are things with the old man  matt theyre fine talks about you lot an awful lot  liam oh really  sam not true not true  ashley did you have a good year together sort of 
none	 i guess that was the last time we saw you  have things been good  matt she pats the side of her coin purse which you can see is rather thick and makes a heavy  clinking of clinking coin not been too bad if i say so myself more than i ever made playing violin  taliesin profit suits you well  marisha i dont know if she was referring to monetary wealth but sure  travis well if you cant have an earnest relationship with someone  at least shes got money  taliesin its also very

none	 cups roll across the ground come to a stop pulls out a small looks like a leather  satchel of some kind thats wrapped over the top and the side with twine unwraps it theres a  few something for you sets it down pulls a necklace off youre borrowing this but youre  bringing it back when youre done  sam of course  matt all right now which one of you but him wants it  jon oh i do i do  matt okay throws it to you  jon its really coollooking  matt its a

none	 thats like you sneezing into a bottle  jon do you have an extra necklace that turns chocolate milk into like healing  matt ill put the word out for you see what we can find  laura are we heading out immediately  sam theres nothing to wait for  marisha i actually do have a necklace i have an old necklace  sam what are we talking about now  jon everybody went from no potions to well ive got this ive got this  laura i dont know why i asked for potions when we had four 
none	 fucking potions  taliesin it might be that thing that i got rid of  marisha i had an old card that was the necklace that gave 1 to attack and damage while  sam thats an attunement item we dont need that shit lets go  marisha all right sorry your employer overruled me kord or card or chode  laura lionel  matt all right please out of my space and you watch as her form shifts back to that of aes  adan the meat man  travis thats impressive  matt thank you treat that well

none	 miles  southeast of ankharel across the desert  jon you guys its gonna be a really long hike so lets find another burning tree or sun tree or  something that we can just walk into cause that was way easier than traveling  taliesin misty step  laura not misty step wind walk  travis you can do the tree thing too  jon no ive never seen that i can show you how to get there but it seems  travis have you ever tried  jon tried through the sun tree what do i do do 
none	 i just  laura you have to ask him  jon im good at okay  liam absolute conviction  jon so i go over to the nearest tree  matt okay about maybe one block up theres  jon about one block guys come on leading the way  matt all right solid trunk palm  marisha he likes it when youre super chill and casual with him so be cool  jon he so the trees are like dudes  laura all of them  marisha mouths just go with it  jon he likes it when youre 
none	 what  taliesin chill and casual  jon oh okay so i go up to the tree do i touch it youre the tree hey can you open up and take  us to crown what was it smouldercrown entrance just cause wait it would be way easier to just  go straight to the pyramid  liam yeah but its more like a stroking thing you dont just leave your hand in place  jon okay so hey im chill can you just take us be cool  travis the barks a little dry maybe it needs a little 
none	 moisture there you go  sam screams  jon so yeah its cool were cool if you want to take us there if not we get it is that  pretty chill  marisha thats pretty chill yeah  laura im surprised its not working honestly thats the most chill ive ever seen  sam why am i playing the tree  jon are you guys  marisha you know that intimate hug we had earlier kinda do that  jon aes now im talking to aes  sam oh okay yes  jon this reminds me of times when 
none	 i was a kid and kids would are they making fun of me  sam they are definitely making fun of you  jon oh come on  liam whatre you telling him lies for  taliesin we do this to everybody its all right  jon you do  marisha its part of the initiation  taliesin but yes we are making fun of you  jon sorry tree wait are the trees really alive  laura no they are  jon okay sorry tree but that was kinda fun stroking it  marisha the tree appreciates it  
none	 jon anyways why dont you guys just do the sun tree thing  sam we cant really do that we need to know where the tree is  that were going to be going to  liam theres a lot of tree science involved  marisha if you could maybe potentially help me meat man  sam i havent been there have i  matt you havent been to smouldercrown no  marisha why were you just talking like the meat man  sam i have not been to the place we are going i do not know of any 
none	 tree  matt yeah the only one whos been there is lionel  marisha youve been there  jon yeah im the one who saw it and told you guys about it  marisha were there trees  jon yeah there were a couple deadlooking trees not huge ones how big do they have to be  marisha they looked dead  jon they looked a little deadish  marisha they were dead like very dead  jon do they have to be alive  marisha i think so right  jon i really wanted to see that sun tree 
none	 thing  travis well use it to go back  marisha would you prefer to be a cloud  jon i can be a cloud  marisha i could be a cloud but im gonna blow a 7thlevel spell for it  laura wait but how many people can you do because we also have doty  marisha ten let me see  liam can you turn an automaton a robit into cloud did we do that already  sam not too many were ten exactly  travis really  laura yeah trinkets in the necklace  travis doty taryon 
none	 scanlan  laura oh shit taryon and scanlan  sam thats ten isnt it  ashley but thats blowing a 7thlevel spell how long does it take to hike up there  sam 290 miles  matt wind walk is a 6thlevel spell not a 7th  marisha but ive already used my 6thlevel spell to transport via plants thats what im saying  so im gonna have to use a 7thlevel spell to do it  matt this is true  travis its worth it  liam does that work on doty  matt so youd be able to 
none	 get all of you  taliesin would it work on doty  matt willing creatures technically hes considered a creature for the targeting reason of  spells and effects so yeah  liam tary  marisha so we can do that but then we might wanna rest or we can do some scouting take a  look i wont be completely tapped out  liam we can camp it up if we need to  taliesin itll take more than a day to get there anyway so this way well just save some time and  well take a day 
none	 to take a look around  laura lets go  liam lionel this is really awesome for real youre going to like this  marisha ready ready everybody join hands join hands join hands  laura do we have to join hands for this  sam we dont at all not at all  jon can we still do it  marisha poof  matt all right you guys feel a warm magical effect go through you as youre concentrating  consider yourself being a cloud you are the cloud you open your eyes lionel and you look  and 
none	 you are a fucking cloud youre like 20 feet up  jon oh check this out spits  matt as you do that you watch as more cloud spit goes fft and just more cloud your body is  moisture when you try and talk it just goes exhale  jon so you cant really talk  matt cant really talk youre a cloud so if you wanted to you could spend a minute to concentrate  and revert back and you can do that you have an eighthour period where  you can just turn back and forth  
none	 laura we should probably concentrate for just a minute im gonna turn back just so i can shout  out we should all follow you know how to get there right lionel  jon wind noises  laura bob up and down if its a yes okay were going to follow you all right and when its  ready to land then just hover down and well all follow your lead  jon fart sound  laughter  laura thats totally normal we all do it all right  matt all right so you all go into your mist forms 
none	 and begin to follow after lionels lead as  you guys coast over the upper areas of ankharel its a beautiful view looking down at this  gorgeous city just this glittering jewel of color and architecture one of the older cities in  exandria that portions of it seem to have survived elements of the age of arcanum and the calamity  and one of the first societies to spring up thereafter and its beautiful to see this  history far longer than that of taldorei or at least the human societies of taldorei just  standing obstinate against 
dung	 the dark oppression of the surrounding desert you continue to head in  that direction with you leading lionel i need you to roll a survival check  laura survival check we might get lost  taliesin add that to your survival  jon 14  matt 14 all right so youre traveling at an incredible speed like youre used to walking  speed running speed sometimes maybe horsey speed this is a very very fast speed youre  coasting through the air right as the sun begins to set and the night begins to hit you keep  relatively 
none	 low to the ground so you have your darkvision to see the topography and get an idea  of where its going and the direction you can look up and see the stars above youve traveled  and youve been amongst this desert most of your life so you have a good sense of how to follow  that and because of that youre able to maintain your directional position towards the  smouldercrown mountains you push on about halfway through the journey you can see some  little flames occasionally in the distance what looks to be either caravan 
none	 camps or bandit camps  or various nomad circles that are set up for the night where different campfires are placed  whether its beacons traps or just people to stay warm for the evening you know best not to  stop whenever you see a flame in the middle of the desert the winds are picking up and getting  colder the stark contrast between the temperature of the day and the night here is immense and your  moisture form takes on the cold fairly quickly and you feel even though youre in this form the  chill 
none	 still captures you a bit as your condensation begins to slightly crystallize in  places but you push on roll one more survival check please  laura dont get us lost  jon 15  matt 15 and without an issue or any sort of a loss of step or position eventually you watch as  the ominous spirelike jagged daggertopped smouldercrown mountains begin to break the horizon  and make their way towards you youre now at that speed it hasnt been that long since you  left maybe a few hours out of ankharel so youre maybe around 
none	 ten oclock in the evening or  so 1030 going to go ahead and move over here to a non  taliesin i was gonna argue that since he has the duck totem that technically he would have a  natural migration sense of what direction he was gonna go  matt thats a good argument to make but not necessary but good for holding on to that  taliesin yeah just thought id put that out there i feel like his duck sense would be  tingling always knows where south is  matt not denying recognized but unnecessary 
none	 in the moment  taliesin unnecessary but worth noting  matt worth noting indeed but yeah so the spires of the mountain are surprisingly steep  theyre steeplelike almost in a lot of places theyre all just jutting up like these gargantuan  spikes that were pressed out of the earth from some sort of landmass shift or some volcanic  activity long long ago but you can see the densely packed rock formations and the mountain  cluster is maybe at most ill say three miles four miles across its not a very very big  mountain range and 
none	 its called smouldercrown because the circular pattern of the ovallike  pattern of the mountains that rise up and resembles at a distance like a kings crown in the  way that it circles around itself you recall one of three different entrances the one that was  safest that you guys took when you entered the central portion of the mountain range from the  outside and you guide the rest of them to the exterior of this space you can see its a small  valley between two of the exterior mountains that collide together and there is 
none	 a valley path  where you see a number of dried trees some do appear to be alive keyleth though theyre  designed to weather extreme droughts they seem to have some sort of weird fruit that theyre  bearing dripping off some of the branches but the leaves themselves are brown and withered and  you havent quite seen plant lalife plant life like this before  laura plant lalala  matt plant lavalafl  marisha does it look like its natural decay  matt if you want to go and approach it and inspect it you can  
none	 marisha how far were still clouds  matt you guys are maybe 100 feet up or so and youve just now hit the edge of the smouldercrown  mountain range  marisha starting to go into the entrance  matt yes the entrance of the mountains you havent found an entrance to the actual mountain  rock itself  marisha are we going to go on foot from here  matt thats up to you guys  taliesin i think well get a little closer  marisha ill wait til we get closer from up here does the mountain formation 
none	 look like its  naturally formed or like some sort of other event is it seismically formed  matt make a nature check  marisha oh not good whats my nature okay 16  matt 16 not bad they appear to be seismically formed you can see some of the rocks the way  they rise up in the smaller areas are at an angle where its smooth on one side and you can see the  layers beneath where portions of the earth seem to have been jammed cracked and pushed upward but  because its so localized it 
none	 isnt like theres tectonic plates shifting or anything its not a  mass range most mountain ranges are long driven locations that mark where those various boundaries  are this is just a central formation so youre uncertain as to what the nature of this creation  was but it seems natural  laura im picturing beautiful bob ross mountains just lightly touch  marisha happy accidents  taliesin happy little tpk  matt yeah percy can i have you roll a perception check please  taliesin yes im not gonna roll that cause youve been i feel like thats 
none	 yours it landed  on other dice im gonna let it be there though actually yeah its 20  matt okay you mr human with no actual darkvision do not get lost on the path taryon  could i have you also roll a perception check  sam 15 plus something minus one 14  matt okay so you fall a little behind the group  sam doty has lowlight vision i think  matt doty has darkvision well say that doty manages to get you caught up a little bit you  fall a bit behind but you do 
dung	 manage to find the rest of the team you dont get terribly lost in  the middle of the dark desert sky of these small wisps of cloud with no light other than starlight  there to guide your path forward they begin to just pull ahead and vanish into the horizon you  freak out but doty eventually finds you as a cloud and you swear you hear the wind go tary  laughter  matt you continue to push forward eventually leading into the outside of this entrance of  smouldercrown where the rest of them have gathered 
none	 you guys begin to slowly push into the  valley that makes its way towards the center of smouldercrown following lionels leads these  trees that you notice keyleth theyre sporadic in places and there is scrub brush sparse there  are areas of the ground where its dried and cracked the badlands here the sands of the  deserts the big storms largely dont make it into the center of the valley because the mountains  protect it while there are elements of it here and there you can see the  topography and the landscape here is very 
none	 dried cracked red earth little moisture seems to be  contained here the plant life that exists here is designed to subsist on very very little water  you eventually come lionel to the area where you believe you found the last entrance make an  investigation check if you dont mind  jon 21  matt 21 okay then you very quickly look around and recall some of the landmarks  jon im still in cloud form  matt youre still in cloud form but you see some of the landmarks that seem to triangulate where  you originally 
none	 found the entrance however to truly search in this area youd have to get low  and probably go to your physical form to seek it out all right so you take a minute to  concentrate and you revert back into your halforc form  laura i go down and do it too cause he did it  matt okay everyone else joining him  all yes  matt all right so the rest of the party goes and they take their physical form  laughter  jon that was awesome guys  laura is this where it is 
dung	  matt youre able to see in the dark for a decent amount you walk the perimeter of this space where  the first cavern was and you feel around and you gather that there was a path here but it looks  like theres been a small cavein a lot of the rocks appear like theyve been recently fallen in  and theres some sort of a grade to them where you watch loose rocks have recently been tossed around  that are of a deeperset red color and havent been quite as weathered as the exterior of the 
none	  mountain appears to be so apparently the entrance that you originally used either has collapsed on  its own or was intentionally shut  jon i couldve sworn it was right here you guys i dont know whats with all these rocks  laura it looks like it was caved in actually  liam this is 100 the spot  jon pretty sure i mean i dont have the best memory or knowledge or brains or really any  skills but im pretty sure this was it  laura dont be so hard on yourself lionel  marisha does 
none	 it look deliberate or does it look natural  matt make an investigation check  jon well it could be i have an idea you guys lets ask the ducks  laura are there ducks here  jon theres no ducks here  marisha natural 19 from gil 22  jon we can see if there are if we commune with ducks  matt the cavein is not natural the rocks you can see the portion of the archway where the  natural mountain rock becomes the rockslide that seems to have filled the space there is no damage  
none	 that seems to be seismic or quaked and you can see what appear to be some cleft sides at the edge  of this entrance where it appears like elements of it were actually hacked or damaged until it  eventually fell in  laura are there any kind of tracks around or footfalls that look like it was recent  matt roll a for you it would be a survival check cause youre a tracker  laura and its a mountain  taliesin i honestly think they might have trapped it  laura i can roll that one again 
dung	  liam ill wait until she has looked and then ill take a look  laura yeah thats way better 27  matt as you guys are having this moment and you get low to the ground and begin to read the  patterns of the different rocks that have tumbled and left small grooves and a little bit of dust  and sand that does reside over this dark caked dirt and rock and you do notice a number of  footprints theyre scattered a bit some older some newer theres been a lot of foot traffic in  
dung	 and out of this cavern fairly recently like a week or so ago and you begin to follow the  tracks some lead back the path you came some seem to circle around further into the valley  around this mountain  laura i think ive picked something up should we follow it now or should we  sam its dark  laura  camp out and do it in the morning  marisha cover for me im gonna drop down and do a commune with nature  travis how do we cover you  taliesin she talks to nonducks 
none	  marisha can lionel and i commune together and do bonuses can i be like can you call your ducks  jon thats what i was trying to do  marisha all right  matt ill say as you begin to cast the spell you take lionels hands and focus and lionel you  close your eyes and you imagine before you the most beautiful desert duck that could ever exist  and for a good 45 seconds 50 seconds 60 seconds nothing and that sadness in your heart sinks a  bit that perhaps aes or scanlan as these 
none	 weird people keep calling him said there are no ducks  here and you hear in the darkness flapping wings squawk impact sound it runs into the  side of the mountain tumbles down onto the ground duck sounds  sam its a miracle  taliesin it certainly is  jon the duck  laura wait you can call them to you  jon i mean i just normally that happens  laura thats a power thats amazing  taliesin do they obey you or is it a partnership  laura could you call multiple to you and they pick 
none	 you up and fly you through the air  jon you guys are confusing me look i just talk to them  marisha you know its okay  taliesin lets not question this  matt so which of you wants to commune with the duck  liam let the expert  jon okay what do we wanna know  marisha how deep is the cavein  jon how deep is the cavein okay  sam to the duck  taliesin they knew about the others  sam sure sure  jon i ask the duck how deep is the cavein 
none	  matt okay the duck 20 feet  laughter  travis thats a chillasfuck duck yall  jon you couldnt understand that i was like you guys that duck was really chill  laughter  laura no i can tell his body language is super chill for a duck  jon 20 feet what else do we want do we wanna ask if he recognizes who did this  marisha thats a good one thats a good one yeah yeah yeah  jon hey greenie how who did this what caused the cavein  matt people  marisha you know 
none	 i have a similar problem when i try to talk to cows they have faceblindness  laura im just gonna stealthily start following the path around  matt stealth check  marisha is there another entrance into this cavern  jon thats good thats good should we ask the nearest wheres the nearest entrance  laura 29  jon or the safest entrance  marisha are there other entrances  jon hey greenie how many other entrances are there to this about  matt two  jon two uhoh that was two questions  marisha is that two including this 
none	 entrance  matt flapping wings  jon wait wait wait  travis duck hunt shoot it vex  jon meant to ask where the entrances are sorry you guys  marisha well there is another one its good its fine its good in fact i can double down  on this can i now do my commune with nature and see if i can map out this cavern and find the  other entrances  matt okay so as youve now sat down and you focus you can sense the guardian duck that was  temporarily summoned is now wandering 
none	 out to the desert probably to dehydrate and die horribly  when the morning light comes  jon i dont know about this i dont know about this aw hes going home to his family  taliesin in a way yes  matt however you connect and you can feel your spiritual essence connect with the land here the  landscape is something youre not used to elements of it remind you of pyrah though not as  visceral and volcanic but the general heat and barren aspect of the landscape is familiar in some  ways so as you 
none	 extend yourself you can breathe and you can feel the land breathe with you and as  that communion hits you feel you could ask some questions of the terrain  marisha where are the other two entrances to this cavern  matt you get as is the essence of answering these questions you sense that there is one near  the top of the spire and there is one not terribly far from where you are kind of continuing inward  towards the valley but it doesnt specify directly where it doesnt put an x on your map  
none	 for you you just know that ones towards the top and ones further around the path youre going  marisha can i hang on around the path okay how deep is the ziggurat from here can i sense  the other ziggurat  matt you focus and you sense that there is almost like a cyst in the ground you can sense  some subterranean cavern maybe about 400 500 feet into the heart of the mountain from where you  currently sit you can sense there this kind of pulsing darkness almost like a terrible  cancerous heartbeat in 
none	 the center of this land  marisha okay what else whats the last one what should i do  sam are there any people around  taliesin has anybody been through that upper passageway  marisha yeah yeah yeah can i sense any other maraudering douchebags  matt well you can ask questions about people powerful celestials fey fiends elementals or  undead influence from means of other existences  marisha humanoids what about humanoids  matt you want to try and sense humanoids you ask about it your attention is shifted back towards  that weird cystziggurat area in 
none	 the center of the mountain and the land seems to give you the idea  that there are a number of humanoids there right now  marisha shit do they look like cultisty people  matt you dont have a visual your vision isnt brought there you just kind of sense that theyre  there theyre inside the mountain  marisha what  jon i couldve told you there was people at the pyramid  taliesin well last time whos here now  jon well why would they leave  marisha i dont know i said theres all these cool 
none	 cult people  yeah they could leave  jon its good to know that theyre still there  travis were there people inside  marisha a decent amount of people  matt so vex is gone  travis wheres vex  liam what did you find out  marisha a lot of people theres another entrance nearby i think further  down this path its close  liam well vex went this way is it in that direction  marisha what what do you mean she went where  matt you actually didnt see the direction she went  liam 
none	 do we see footprints going in a direction though you described  matt nobody else did only she was tracking literally  you all turn around and vex is just gone  marisha i think theres also an entrance at the top of this spire if we want to do a downward  approach but that seems risky  matt you follow the tracks and about 200 or so feet around the edge and you have to follow them  between a few smaller rocks that are jutting out at the base of the mountain and the terrain  itself 
none	 rolls a bit and cracks in places there are small fissures from recent rains that caused  the earth to well up and tear in places and eventually the tracks curve in towards the  mountain and end and its just sheer mountain theres no sign of an entryway visually  laura can i search for one  matt make an investigation check  laura do i get advantage because its a mountain  matt you do actually yes favored terrain  laura fucking balls perception  matt investigation  laura no i want perception  matt youre getting investigation 
none	  laura 11  matt 11 you have no idea where the entrance is the tracks end in this general vicinity and its  just rock it doesnt even look like theres handholds  laura weird i wonder if its an illusion can i put my hand on the rocks  and see if theres an illusion  matt okay you put your hands out to feel against the rock and your hand passes through  laura whatwhat i feel like vex is really good at finding illusions oh shit okay well can i  put the front of my 
none	 face through the wall and see what i see  matt sure you poke into the darkness and it is pitchblack on the inside as you poke past the  illusion its about two inches or so of this rocky heavy orangered stone and as you peer in  you can see a cavern about ten feet wide or so and about 12 to ten feet tall natural along the  walls you can see the ground itself is smoothed over and its straight its a straight tunnel  its not a rocky natural formation its like it was pushed 
none	 and carved into the rock like  something heavy or something very focused drove through you glance over to the side and you  catch what appears to be a face in the wall about that big around its featureless you just see  two eye sockets a mouth and a nose you see a flash of green light i need you to make a  constitution saving throw  laura well its too late constitution saving throw  travis can we also say that we put our earrings back in the next day  matt i assumed you did 
none	  travis because were professionals  laura that was almost so good but then it wasnt ten  matt ten no that does not succeed  travis curious little cat  laura im a rogue now you guys  taliesin had to poke it  matt you take 61 points of necrotic damage as a familiar sting as the green light flash turns  into a piercing beam of lifedraining energy one that once almost brought you to the edge of death  before and as it hits you you feel your breath and life essence sucked out of your 
none	 nose and mouth  and ears like a giant vacuum is pulling the essence out of your body the veins bulge you  cant breathe and you pull yourself back out of the illusory wall and have to gasp for a moment  you guys hear the gasping as you begin to approach that side and you find  your sister there grabbing herself  laura coughing jenga not full jenga  ashley what happened what happened what happened  laura dont go through the wall can i heal pike  ashley yes yes  laura theres a thing in 
none	 there theres a face and it sucks your life out i found a door  though guys  jon wheres the door  laura dont im not even going to tell you where the door is  im not going to tell him where the door is  travis we dont see a door  jon i dont see a door  laura nobody touch the rocks  liam but theres a bad door somewhere around here  laura theres a bad door just listen for a moment bad door right in front of me fake bad  door if 
none	 you go through it there is a very bad face that sucks your life out  liam a bad face  laura yeah  taliesin theres a door you cannot see and a bad face sucks your life away  laura yeah im going to take my oracle arrow and crouch down  sam wait wait wait before you do that are you sure thats  liam yeah slow down youre doing all the shit  sam youre going to just shoot something in there what if they see it fly in  laura thats why i was going to 
none	 crouch down and shoot the arrow super low to the ground  liam what if they still see the arrow fly in  laura well when i peeked my head in before i got my life sucked out i didnt see anything in  front of me did i  liam im going to assume that before we heard her gasping keyleth was filling us in  marisha you know i think its right around that direction follow the gasping it feels like its  really close to the gasping  liam im going to go check out the top 
none	 mist sound  laura give me shit and then take off on your own  liam well im not going to stick my face in something  matt all right so you fly up flapping wings 60 feet a round itll take you a good five  minutes or so to make your way towards the top end of the spire as youre going make an  investigation check  liam can i stealth as cloud  matt oh youre going cloud sorry i thought you were doing your wings as a cloud you get there  really fast so 
none	 as you make it up there you cannot i will say for the purposes of this  liam im wind im not going high im going through the treetops  matt yeah so make a stealth check  liam all right i will that is very good that is a 35  matt 35 okay as far as you understand no one seems to see you make an investigation check as  you make your way up the mountainside to check for any sort of entrances  laura you should mark off one of your lucks because you already used 
none	 it for the day  liam i did its on the plastic  sam keep him honest  liam oh man i love you so wholeheartedly and on a regular basis you kick me in the goolies i  dont understand it  sam good old fourluck obrien  liam seven luck its not per game its per day so if we go to bed it resets fart knockers im  doing investigation thats 18  matt 18 you glide around there for a good ten 15 minutes or so scouring the edge all you know  is its near 
dung	 the top and you see no sign of an entrance  liam okay so its not a volcanic hole or anything theres just a secret entrance  matt no she told you there was supposedly an entrance but you see nothing sheer rock there  are a couple of indents that could be cave entrances but when you get close you see its  just a small alcove that ends  laura maybe you should try sticking your face against some of the sheer rock face  liam i return to my loving sister kind and good i land and 
none	 say i saw another face but i didnt  stick my face in it because that would be stupid  marisha i wonder if theres another face behind the cavein  laura you know what i should probably find out and i shoot the oracle arrow  matt okay you shoot the oracle arrow and  marisha wait into the cavein or the illusory wall  matt how far do you fire it is it full strength is it a lob  laura no i dont want to go crazy far i want to get in a little bit further 
none	 to see if i can find  any more traps and see how that face works  travis what percentage of your strength do you shoot it at 70 50 25  laura 65 percent of my strength is used  matt okay whoosh as you release it its still a good distance it whoosh continues through as  you go past the face the one that shot the green light you can see the front of it is darkened  now from where before it was untouched it cruises past you see the formations it looks  like theres 
none	 some cool designs here and there the arrow eventually comes to rest you dont see  anything of interest as you pass by that quickly you do see a very very faint glow down the hall  you can see the glimmer of light and as you watch its shifting ever so slightly flickering  like firelight  laura i think theres a fire further in  travis was the face there  laura the face is in there  travis was it doing the lifesucking thing  laura not to my arrow but it was there on the wall 
none	  travis ill go in  laura no no no grog dont  ashley she got hurt  travis yeah but im stacked for days  laura we should dispel it or something  jon i got your back grog  taliesin weve got another entrance  marisha i can dispel magic still  laura yeah see if you can dispel the magic  taliesin lets see if theres a second entrance  marisha well there is a second entrance one is up top  taliesin well theyre going to think were coming in through here because they know about 
none	  this entrance maybe they dont know about the other one so we could maybe be super tricky and  take an entrance they dont know about at all  marisha i can clear out the cavein i imagine if someone is trying to cause an intentional cavein  theyre anticipating no one going through that cavein and we can start there  jon i at least know my way in if we cleared that  taliesin if i were expecting people id expect them through the entrance i take or the cavein  not a third entrance i dont 
none	 know about though assuming they dont know about it  marisha but they do know about the up he said there was a face  jon no hes talking about the third entrance thats lower  taliesin higher  jon no i thought that was the higher one  marisha hang on hang on there are three entrances the cavein the one where vex just got  exploded and one through the top of the spire  liam which i could not find  taliesin should we take a group look for the top of the spire  marisha if 
none	 we go through the cavein entrance i can clear it out i will clear one of my last  highlevel spells but lionel knows his way through that way  laura yeah but we shouldnt go in the night we need to rest  marisha but i can clear it tonight  taliesin we could just make a tiny hole in the cavein and become smoke and go inside is that  not possible he asked  matt that may be quite possible actually  taliesin so that they wouldnt even know that we had cleared it  it would 
none	 just be relatively untouched  marisha can we camp out inside  matt its a gaseous form so yeah  laura we would have to camp inside the cavein  taliesin its either that or camp right in front of the front door after just triggering a spell  laura oh scanlan weve been so long without you i forgot we had it  marisha oh my god we have the mansion  liam i mean only if you want to i remember that being a sore spot  sam i dont even know if you guys want me to 
none	 come in with you ive taken you this far but if you  need me in there ill come  ashley no youll be coming  sam all right lets make a hole and go in and then we can camp the night inside  jon i think some of my dead comrades we could use as pillows theyre probably still in there  taliesin that may not be necessary  ashley body pillow  taliesin im so proud of you that was amazing  matt so whats the plan guys  laura were going to go back to the 
none	 cavein oh wait wait wait i did have a question i feel  like it might be smart to get my arrow out of there in case anybody  comes out and sees an arrow  ashley thats a good idea  laura but i dont know how to do that is there an unseen servant or something  jon ill run in real fast and get it  sam no do not do that i scanlan shorthalt can go get it if youd like  laura no scanlan thats not what i meant  sam i can go get 
dung	 it if youd like  laura no i dont want you to go in it fucking sucks your life out  sam its easy ill be there and back in two seconds  jon but theres a facesucking thing  laura do i know how many feet in it went  matt youre not entirely certain id say a couple hundred maybe 150  travis you did 65 percent of your  sam youre an expert marksman you know within 100 feet yeah how about this why dont you  shoot an arrow right now outside the cave same strength 
none	 and see how far it goes  laura you got it  matt okay so whats the range on your bow  laura oh thats a good question fenthras exalted  matt its a longbow its just a general longbows range do you have that written down  laura what like 120 feet is it that or is it more  matt 150 is your first increment and then 600 is your second increment  taliesin 65 is like 400 feet  matt approximately yeah  taliesin or the closest wall did it hit a wall  matt it did 
none	 not hit a wall  taliesin 400 feet  laura thats really far no but how would you do it how would you do it  sam i have ways  liam could you see through the mouth of this face that you saw when you were in there  laura i saw eyes  matt there was no eyes there was empty sockets a mouth and a nose and then suddenly the sockets  began to glow green for a second and then the hit  laura the sockets glowed green and then i got hit  liam so 
dung	 you couldnt see through the mouth it was just a dark maw  laura right but the eyes glowed  ashley youre just going to go in there scanlan  sam you want to come  ashley how are you going to do this  sam the way i always go dimension door  laura what if it can reach you that far in  sam it cant  ashley how do you know  sam i assume  ashley well im not going with you  sam great  liam ill go with you  sam you cant  
none	 laura youre too big  sam ill just go dimension door 400 feet straight in  ashley wait ill go with him im going to go with you im keeping my eye on him  matt all right poof you guys appear inside the cavern darkness you can see the firelight ahead  the flicker at the end of the tunnel and you can see the tunnel the straight portion of it maybe  100 feet forward begins to shift and bend a little bit it starts to turn into more of a  natural cavern as it goes whatever 
none	 drove its way in here has merged with a natural path on the  inside of the mountain possibly even merged with the cavein path you look on the ground and both  of you guys make investigation checks if you dont mind  ashley investigation did you say  sam 30  ashley im sure he found something 11  matt in the time it takes you to go okay were looking hes like found it you find the  arrow a little dust drifts off of it and as youre walking you can see that theres a softness 
none	  to the ground here you get the sense that the formation whatever rock was pushed through here  was theres no pile of rock outside theres no symbol of the earth that was carved out of this  tunnel recently it seems placed anywhere theres just an absence of rock and theres a  heavy layer of dust on the ground  laura do either of you have dust of tracelessness  ashley no well  sam go back  ashley yeah lets go back  sam will you hold my hand  ashley no no dont push your 
none	 luck  matt poof you guys bamf back out of the outside you watch as scanlan and pike reemerge  from the outside scanlan holding your arrow triumphant  laura oh its dusty was it dusty in there  sam it was very dusty in there  liam any footprints  ashley none that we could see  sam soft untread earth  liam weird  laura thank you  marisha oh no  liam what is it kiki  marisha maybe this is the unused entrance maybe the cavein is the more recent  laura no i see tracks 
none	 coming in and out of this place i know theres people that use this  matt yeah fairly recent tracks  liam but you saw no footprints inside  ashley did you scanlan you shouldve seen something did you look  sam no i forgot i was looking for the arrow that was our mission  ashley well i was just making sure you werent going to run away so i was preoccupied  jon so you guys both accomplished your missions awesome  laura maybe we should go back into the other side then unless somebody can just fucking 
none	 dispel  that face and then we can just go in this way  marisha i could attempt it i have dispel magic with me right now  travis do it  marisha all right ill do it  liam is the plan to camp out tonight in the mansion by a fire whichever  laura in the mansion  taliesin im going to point out ive already been looking for a way into the cavein while  youve all been being ridiculous  laura youve already gone back  taliesin the minute he suggested that he get it i 
none	 didnt want to be a part of that so i just  immediately went in to start testing to see if there was ways we could just meld through the  cavein or if we actually had to make a hole  matt so youre inspecting  taliesin i mistyed out of that the minute that he started working on it  matt so youre over currently looking for a way through  taliesin seeing if i can find ways through  matt you manage to squeeze through a few crevices between the stones and rock but its pretty  
none	 densely packed you get maybe five feet in before you cant really find a way to get your whole mist  form through  taliesin im going to start back to normal at the very top of the pile looking to see if i can  start scraping through using my sword to make a crevice  matt okay so youre working on that what are you guys doing  sam are we trying to dispel the magic or are we going in the other way maybe we should just make  a decision  marisha im trying to dispel 
none	 the magic  matt okay so you walk up to the illusory wall  marisha im having vex be like tell me where it is can i prepare it so as soon as i poke my head  in i can be like dink  matt okay you poke your head in and as soon as you glance off to the side you can see the stone  face in the wall  marisha poof  matt cast dispel magic doesnt seem to have an effect  marisha bail bail bail out  laura did it hit you that fast 
none	 it didnt hit you  matt there was no attack from the face either  taliesin i get the distinct impression perhaps that you used it up and probably alerted them  that somebody was at that entrance  laura lets maybe move away from the entrance  marisha can i peek my head back in and do a  matt you glance in no trigger nothing the face seems inert  laura i peek my head in does the flickering light in the distance seem brighter  matt make a perception check  laura its too many choices too 
none	 many dice fucking shit motherfuck  wait wait its a mountain  matt it is a mountain you get to have an advantage thats what rangers do man  liam was the light seen by the arrow  matt the light was seen by the arrow  liam so youre looking at the face  laura no im looking in the fucking tunnel  matt the face is on the side of it its beyond  liam oh it keeps going  matt yeah so depending on how high her perception is she may now that she sees the  
none	 flicker at the end she may be able to see something so how high did you roll  laura 31  matt that would be high enough to just barely focus your halfelven eyes and glance down you  get to see the very faint bead of light at the very tip and it doesnt seem to change over the  next 30 seconds next minute next two minutes while you focus intently  you dont see any shift or change  ashley should we just go in  laura we could  jon so you think the face is 
none	 recharging  laura i think i might have used up its only charge potentially or its recharging  jon its like a booby trap used once  liam i will take a look at it and look at the area and see if theres anything left to it or  other traps further down  matt okay make an investigation check  sam well if hes going in taryon will go in and identify the thing  matt okay go ahead and make an arcana check  liam 19  matt 19 okay you glance by you check it as 
none	 you both are looking at it both taryon and vax  approach the face and the carving is rudimentary it looks more like it was prepared as the basis  of what did you roll  sam 17 but ive got identify  matt yeah theres no magical essence to it any longer but your arcana check shows that you can  see that there are certain small carvings in it that look to be some sort of sigil or glyph that  is designed to hold a spell until triggered and then its released actually pike youve used  
none	 this once before its an actual glyph of warding spell that is utilized to hold a spell in and  release it upon some sort of a trigger  sam so its onetime use so were good to go in this way if wed like  laura does the glyph of warding alert you once its gone off  ashley i dont think so  matt you dont recall you didnt know your glyph went off until you found the destroyed body of the  prisoner that you had released in westruun long ago  laura oh right the guy 
none	 that was stealing all that gold  ashley and then i think we also put one on the top of the loot for the dragon  matt thats the one that got him he tried to get some money on the way out and you found his body  blown up and dragged about 20 feet off before he expired  ashley yeah i dont think it alerts anybody  laura okay good then we are probably safe going in im going to cast pass without a trace on us  im going to see how many people i can 
none	 cast it on every creature i choose within 30 feet of me so  sweet its everybody  matt yep all right you notice lionel as you guys step in even in your darkvision which by  the way for your two human companions it is complete darkness you had a little bit of  starlight and your eyes had adjusted to it where you could see the edges and rims of different  shapes within the mountain range but once you step past the illusory barrier into the interior  of the cavern it is just darkness  laura 
none	 is percy back yet  taliesin yes i just got back  laura percy hold on to my waist dear  sam should we use our flashlights or no  taliesin no i dont think so  liam im going to stay 30 feet in front of the group and continue to check for traps  matt all right so everyone roll stealth  laura and add ten to it because of pass without a trace  sam dotys going to click his boots of whatever his boots of elven  matt that give him the bonus on stealth checks 
none	  sam yeah elvenkind  travis 26  ashley 30 thats never going to happen again  matt vex  laura 25  liam 37  matt pike is more stealthy than vex right now  laura its because percys holding on to my waist  matt i understand keyleth  marisha 26  taliesin 21  jon 28  sam scanlan got 29 taryon got 25 and doty got a two but with his boots  what do his boots do shit  matt the boots give him advantage on stealth checks he gets to roll again  sam 
none	 okay 17 plus ten yeah  matt there you go so you guys silently make your way in i would like a marching order on this  because it is about ten feet wide this tunnel and you guys can only go in there two at a time  shouldertoshoulder  taliesin whos got the best night vision  laura actually doty has the best night vision hes got complete darkvision oh we all have  darkvision  matt okay so vax and pike in the front  liam check for traps check for traps check for traps  laura 
none	 we didnt take a nap  sam do you want to stop and camp  laura maybe in a little bit  taliesin im all right with the notion of getting a little deeper in  matt all right so pike and vax at the front all right whos after them  laura me and percy  ashley i tug on vaxs shirt just to let him know im there  sam i feel like good old chod should be near the tip of the spear since he knows the inside of this  place a bit  laura thats 
none	 true what did he roll for stealth  matt he rolled a 28 i think  jon have i been in this area  matt you have not been in this specific tunnel you havent seen anything that looks familiar the  path you went before was a natural cavern this one is pushed straight through  jon yeah but i can see how im the only one whos been in this mountain so theres maybe a  little trust i got this i havent been here but i got it  matt all right so do you push your 
none	 way towards the front  jon sure  matt all right so pike and vax as you guys are moving forward your bardbarian friend pushes  aside and muscles up to become the point at the tip of the sphere  jon i cropdust all of you as i go in front of you  matt after that after percy and vex  marisha ill go  matt all right keyleth and we still have taryon scanlan  sam taryon next with doty with him  matt taryon with doty behind doty is going to be two people in the 
none	 cavern so whos behind doty  travis me  matt all right grog and  sam scanlan will be in the rear  matt all right so scanlan is alongside grog i imagine you have trinket in your necklace  laura yes  matt all right so at the very end grog youre walking and scanlans there at your side and  doty walking in front of you lumbering surprisingly quiet and you get the sense the  reason youre so stealthy in here is because as you step its soft its like stepping on a bunch  of very 
none	 very fine powder heavy footsteps it helps cushion your footfalls  marisha like snow or ash  matt like ash almost like a very very fine dust  marisha can i dip down and grab a bit of it and do a nature check on it is it ash  matt sure make a nature check  laura its cocaine  matt first she eats the soul then she just does a line in the middle of the tunnel keyleths gone  off the end its really bad  marisha 15  matt 15s not too bad you taste it 
none	 and you smell it its not ash its very very very fine  powder it has an earthy rock taste to it  liam and are there any tracks or footprints ahead of pike and i  matt make a survival check  liam survival ooh thats good 19  matt 19 you do see some tracks stepping up and down yes  liam both ways  matt both ways  liam shite  matt all right so pushing forward another 30 or 40 feet roll another investigation check  liam not perception  matt not for checking for traps 
none	 man its investigation always been  liam 21  matt 21 okay  sam fine if matt wants to change the rules 100 games in i guess so  matt all right so you continue moving forward you do not see any traps anything that catches  your attention  marisha can i just do a little im going to scoop up a little bit and say percy can i get a  little bit of water added onto this can i do another nature check on what this is  travis you are fucking fascinated with the god damn 
none	 ash  matt im not going to tell you to make another nature check you cant keep making rolls until  you get a better one it turns into an immediate mud its a very very fine silt almost  taliesin what color is the rock  matt the powder you mean  taliesin i cant see anything can i never mind  matt you can see nothing in fact when you say percy get some water on this youre like  what i dont where you have to guide his hand  liam and is it dead silent in 
none	 here  matt its dead quiet from where you currently are you can make a perception check to listen in  to see if you hear anything ahead  liam 24  matt 24 you listen carefully and you hear faint sounds of footsteps and scraping stone in one  little sounds like a whistle like a brief sucking sound and thats it  liam over the earring not alone not alone something up ahead i dont think were camping  laura if we camp then they wont find us they cant see the door  liam what do yall 
none	 want to do  travis youre on point keep going  ashley i say we keep going if its an emergency we can all jump into the mansion maybe  taliesin ill activate my boots  ashley is everybody okay to keep going  matt okay you continue another 40 50 feet down the path make another investigation check  liam natural 20  matt you go a little further ahead and you come upon what appears to be two more of those faces  that are facing the inside of the wall maybe 30 feet ahead and you stop 
none	 you can see theyre both  facing outward towards the center of the hallway  liam kiki a couple more faces can you shimmy your way up here please  marisha i get down on my hands and elbows  laura percy spread your legs i let her crawl through us  liam left hand green  marisha where are they  liam right over there right up ahead 30 feet both sides  matt he points it out to you and you can just barely see the smooth walls the almost oval  circular passageway you can see the 
none	 slight lift of the side rock where the faces  form a very faint profile  marisha i scootch a few more inches and use my last two 3rdlevel spells  matt okay roll a d20 add your wisdom modifier please  marisha just my straight modifier  matt yep  marisha dont fuck me gil okay thats good thats good 19 on the first one  matt okay roll again on the second one  marisha 18 on the second one  matt okay as you take a moment whoosh the first one releases and you watch as the 
none	 face  suddenly begins to glow with this dull grayish black crackling energy and then poof the  energy seems to vanish and disperse with the one on the left you turn and release dispel magic on  the one on the right and you watch as the same effect happens poof disperses as well  marisha okay were good  laura sings youre the best around okay keep going forward  liam grab her shoulder move slowly past pull pickle along and continue to carefully search  matt okay as you approach and step toward the space right between 
none	 where the two faces are you  make one footfall between the two of them and nothing happens  you successfully dispelled the effect  ashley you sneaky  matt wanted to fuck with you you continue pushing forward for another 50 or so feet youre  starting to get fairly close at this point to where the arrow may have dropped  laura oh shit you were right by fucking other faces when you popped in before  matt you moved just a little bit beyond them make another investigation check youre not there  yet but youre getting 
none	 closer  liam 18  matt 18 okay you dont seem to notice any strange or different elements of the topography  that worry you you push on for another 40 50 feet or so and youre just now on the cusp of  where the arrow dropped make another investigation check  laura roll super good  liam thats at least an 18 oh its better than 18 it is 26  matt okay you dont notice any traps or any issues in the vicinity you do see the footprints  of pike and scanlan where they first arrived 
none	 earlier before venturing into this cavern and  pushing forward about 20 or so feet the smooth cavern begins to turn into more of a natural  almost a volcanic tubetype physicality to it and you can see to the left another tunnel merges  with it you begin to recognize this it looks like this carved tunnel is now dovetailing into  the path that you guys found your way in the one that was collapsed on the exit now the path that  you know and the path youre traversing have finally merged into one singular path  
none	 jon i know this place you guys lets go down the left one  laura shh  taliesin left  jon yeah theres one thats we can either go straight or theres one at the  matt the one thats on the left will lead you back to the entrance where you first came in but  it was collapsed the one that you knew if you keep going straight itll lead you towards the  light and where you saw these people last time you were here  jon if we go left its going to take us back 
none	 the other way so thats safe but we could keep going  straight where the light is  liam were here for your friends right  jon yeah they might still be alive and i call out hello  matt okay it echoes hello everyone make a perception check  sam right now im looking at the back of grogs ass but i got a 19  marisha natural 19  travis 10  ashley 22  laura 22  jon 21  taliesin 13  matt 19 you got right  marisha yeah thats a 34 total  liam 
none	 32  matt all right everyone over 20 you listen and you can hear very faint voices whispering and  it sounds like movement moving quicker  laura scanlan maybe now is the time for that door  sam for the door the mansion  laura yeah  sam okay it takes a minute to cast  liam thats not going to work weve got company coming  laura how near do the voices sound  matt they dont sound like theyre getting louder doesnt sound like theyre getting closer  you just hear voices  sam do you want 
none	 me to  laura lets backtrack to the cavedin tunnel  jon maybe its my friends should we go  laura no lets backtrack to the cavedin tunnel and set up the door  marisha you guys go ill wait here just in case  jon ill stay with you  taliesin be quiet  matt okay you guys make your way towards the cavedin entrance  taliesin ill stay with the two of you because i cant see shit and ill slow you down if things  happen theyre going to light up itll be all right  matt 
none	 okay so you guys make your way back to the entranceway  liam i actually stay halfway between both  matt you stay halfway between okay its roughly about 150 200 feet this direction its a  shallower cavern to this area than the one you came through its a longer way in but you manage  to find the other end of this cavein its rocks that have tumbled in and clustered keyleth you  glance over and you see shapes moving in the light and as you glance up ahead about 30 feet  ahead of you you 
none	 see six figures heading your direction humanoid  sam thats 100000 dollars yo six figures moving your direction  marisha holy shit a brand new tesla is coming this way okay hey we have people we have  people coming this way about six of them just letting you know probably going to be some  fighting coming up and that is your update from the voice of the tempest  liam im creeping back  matt all right so you go ahead and you meet up with keyleth the rest of you are back by the  doorway scanlan

none	  ashley i know i dont like it but i cant help it what should i do  laura well your emotions are justified but you found it in your heart to forgive your family and  they did terrible things to you maybe its harder with people that are closer they cut deeper  ashley yeah i think its just because i didnt really know them maybe it was easier to just let  them go and i wasnt as angry as i am with him  laura have you talked to sarenrae about it  ashley no im 
none	 just nervous i know what shell say and have me do and i just want to be  laura you dont want to do it yet  ashley i dont want to do it i just want to be mad for a while i guess but i dont know i  guess just seeing him again slowly but surely im not as mad but  laura hes still charming  ashley i know i just feel like now im acting like im mad almost around him i dont know  hes making me feel so many different kinds of emotions 
none	 im confused  laura i dont know what tomorrow will bring probably a battle of some sort which is usually  lifeendangering just ask yourself if you would want to die without saying how you feel  ashley okay thats a good idea i would feel very bad if something happened to him and i didnt  say anything i mean if i died then i just wouldnt know i guess  laura youd know a few minutes later when we tried to bring you back  i just spit on you im sorry  ashley its fine i dont

none	 a grey  leather band that loops in the back you see a scimitar a very wellmade scimitar that has a  series of pearlescent gems across the hilt it has a very marquesian flair to it and you see what  appears to be a rusty iron sphere that is about three inches in diameter and weighs about a pound  it has a bunch of really strange shapes and design almost like it was made from condensed  chains that were then melted down into a single sphere  it has a really rough texture on the outside 
none	  laura we need to have tary identify it can we drag the box back to the mansion  matt yeah you drag it back dragging noises i mean the box has some food and blankets that are  meant to keep it hidden so you search through as you find them those are the only things of  interest in the box the rest of it just seems to be to fill the space  laura can we hide the bodies  matt sure you guys drag the bodies back  laura yeah and dust of tracelessness to hide 
none	 where they were dragged  taliesin im going to take their cloaks  travis you want me to hide the bodies  laura yeah grog  travis i put the bodies in the bag of holding  laughter  matt okay the opening is about that big so it takes you a second just like when you had to put  dork the ox in there its like trying to fit a kingsized pillow in a twinsized pillowcase  taliesin i fully support it whatever you need to do to feel better man  travis im trying to get over

none	 wait does that require attunement  sam you can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a huge or smaller  creature like my dick that you can see within 60 feet of you as the sphere moves through the air  it opens into a tangle of metal bands like my dick make a ranged attack roll with an attack  bonus equal to your dex modifier plus your blah blah blah if you hit it the target is restrained  until you take a bonus action to speak a command word and 
none	 release it doing so or missing causes  the bands to contract and become a sphere once more so its like a trap ball trap ball  matt its like you know in doctor strange that prison exoskeleton it threw on him  its like that  sam once the band is used it cant be used again until the next dawn like my dick  laura tary youve never been quite so obsessed with your dick before  sam its just that gnome hes so weird and he rubs off on people like my dick  oh im doing

none	 in a 60foot  radius fills the hallway with this highpitched shrieking sound as it hits all of you and the  breath escapes you for a second this circle of deathlike sphere passes all of you and you hear  the shriek echo through both sides of the hallway  laura well if anythings going to bring more skeletons its that  liam clicking my boots  taliesin im going to burn my quick heal might as well  matt what are you guys doing pushing forward staying where you are  laura should you heal us before we

none	 jon theyve heard that before  matt apparently a different one  marisha no ones rolled initiative no one knows were here yet  matt not yet you havent thrown into combat yet you guys just hit a trap and heard things ahead  marisha if you can wait 60 seconds i can make us an elemental  taliesin will the magic fade if we get too close to the ziggurat though  laura maybe well have to fight things outside of the ziggurat  marisha thats a good question i have a mild confession and maybe i should have 
none	 said this a  little earlier but im going to say it now one night i might have sneaked down into the middle  of the ziggurat and i stuck my hand in it  laura what the fuck  sam why would you do that and what happened  marisha well i wanted to find out what would happen and i found out its real bad its really  bad is what i found out and it nearly crushed my hand to a point of oblivion and i think i got  really lucky so i think it just 
none	 crushes anything that it tries to suck in  laura but its a doorway i shot an arrow through it  marisha it is i think your arrow happened to be tiny and fast  taliesin well  liam those 60 seconds have passed  taliesin lets go  matt you were talking instead of casting a spell do you want to take  another minute to cast a spell  travis thanks for the confession though  matt all right so what are you guys doing  laura moving forward keeping an eye out for those  marisha thats 
none	 all i mean dont jump in  liam do you want to go elemental  laura no she wanted to summon an elemental  marisha i wanted to summon an elemental  matt you guys rush forward and a hot wind is picking up through the tunnel youre not quite  sure directionally where its coming from but as you move forward and through the winding passage  maybe 60 feet ahead as it opens up you see it splits into two different pathways of natural  interior rock formations and you can see a larger chamber beyond that you 
none	 have the right and left  laura i pop trinket out  matt okay trinket pops out of your necklace what are you guys doing  laura can i hear the noise of the ziggurat coming from either side more  matt you hear it coming from both sides  travis lets split up  laura what about wind or anything  matt theres the general wind in the room but its whoosh whipping around you picking up sand  and dust from the ground  laura do we see faces on either side  matt perception check  liam 
none	 ill have a look as well  laura 28  liam 24  matt okay you do not see any faces immediately within the two paths that are ahead of you  however as you glance past one of the edges within the chamber you can see the sources of  some of that flickering firelight you see two clay bowls large clay bowls that are set in the  ground that have burning materials inside wood cloth who knows what but theyre burning this  bright orangered flame not a natural yellow flame a deep orangered flame its causing 
none	 this  glow to emanate around the room and you see the flames flickering and moving with the wind thats  blowing about  travis safe to assume this goes to the same room yeah just two different entrances  laura maybe  travis so lets flank  laura i feel like theres traps  marisha i go with percy since we have the robes over top of us  matt all right whos going left and right  travis im going right  jon ill go left  ashley im going right  matt left  liam ill roll 
none	 with percy and keyleth  matt percy and keyleth with vax grog on the right who else is on the right  laura ill go right  matt vex is right pike right or left  ashley yeah right  matt trinkets with you  sam all my people to the right  matt all righty indeed what looked like two different hallways was one entrance to the chamber  that was divided by a singular column in the center you both flank around as it opens up  inside you see a 50foottall 70footwide natural cavern chamber that rounds 
none	 out over the  top and you see it end on the opposite side there are two pillars nearer to your end that both  hold defaced statues of a woman on each defaced statues of a woman partially destroyed and  collapsed there are elements of it broken on the ground the heads removed in the center of the  chamber you see before you a massive stonestepped pyramid similar to the ziggurat  youve found the design is a little different and you get the sense that a lot of it is still  buried and its just 
none	 the top that has been uncovered and repurposed for whatever this may be  you do see there are a number of cloaked figures scattered across these steps and some of them are  out looking in your direction as soon as you come around the side theyre all wearing the same  black outfits the cloaks some of them have the hoods back some of them have the hoods on  roughly you have what looks to be six or seven from what you can view there are two of them at  the very top that currently have 
none	 what looks like another crate that has been opened and there  above them you can see the black orb exactly like the one you have underneath whitestone and  theyre in the process of taking objects out and throwing them up into the sphere and you watch as  they flash and vanish into the darkness you see one cloaked figure thats currently shouting out  and giving commands right now  laura do they see us  matt with all of your stealth you got a 19 correct one of them shouts out  we have visitors  
none	 laura do they only see that side do they see us come around the other side of the pillar they see  all of us  matt as soon as they all glance over you guys are out in the open of a hallway once they see  him they see the spread of you as this happens you watch as a number of skeletons walk out from  the halls on the sides and one seems to suddenly shake and rise up from the ground a large  skeleton with what looks like giant horns that curve out of 
none	 the head standing about 12 feet  tall looks to be some sort of minotaurlike beast but bone and anger  laura how far away is the ziggurat  matt the ziggurat from you guys lets pull out a map  cheering  ashley do you need help  matt i may be able to get this here  laura its such a big map  matt its a big one actually travis do you want to help me with this real fast  jon this time its big  matt were working out the kinks here guys thank you 
none	 very much  sam guys so many great things available in the store tonight those posters  the scanlan thing oh shit  liam combat here we go this is the real deal  laura wait we didnt do this last time did we  jon if i hadnt sneezed you guys we never would have seen this  taliesin they would all be dead right now we would have taken them all out in one clean kill  jon we would have quietly blow gun sounds  sam an overhead cam an outoffocus overhead cam  jon this is 
none	 the place guys  laura wait so its reversed  sam matt only has to manage 22 individual characters right now  matt no its great guys i love it its wonderful  laura so when we tell you which direction we want to go matt its from your perspective  matt well do the best you can to see  travis the maps right  taliesin towards and away from the ziggurat and the ziggurats 1200 and were 600  sam well just say leeward and windward starboard  matt okay so there is a singular figure standing up 
dung	 here that seems to be giving orders  and shouting it out to the side female voice rings out across the center of the chamber and  says remnants slay the intruders and grant their bodies to the cause  laura can i see whose voice that was  matt make a perception check  laura that was crazy 27  matt 27 its hard to see shes in the dark right there and the sphere doesnt give a lot of  light but the voice sounds familiar  sam and laura familiar  matt all right so at this 
none	 point the woman pulls an amulet the woman pulls an amulet out from  beneath the robe and as she clutches it in her hand the orb shifts from black to white to a  whitegray color and you watch as the wind whoosh gets whipped up even heavier and lights  up the area around the space you watch as the cloaked hood flows back and for a brief moment  before the grin crawls across her face you see the face of  delilah briarwood  gasps  sam we killed her shes dead  laura no  
none	 travis look at percy  sam shes dead she died we killed her  ashley oh no  matt yet there she is at the top of the ziggurat  laura how  sam this is like a soap opera  laura dun dun dun  travis i broke the world for you returns  matt i would like you all to roll initiative  travis laughs what  laura i know  ashley this looks like a crazy fight  marisha natural 20  matt nice  marisha if only it was for something a little more important but

none	 life  matt all righty so who else is left pike  ashley seven shes so good at initiative rolling  matt all right so at the beginning of this initiation with the orb now flaring this pale  graywhite and delilah briarwood standing there at the top of the ziggurat staring down and focusing  on the group of intruders that have just rushed in keyleth its your turn  marisha oh god okay i am going to under the cult hood that i have transform my face with  alter self into sylas briarwood  matt okay  
dung	 marisha her husband her dead husband im going to have his face and im going to walk forward  and say delilah dont it is me  matt make a deception check  marisha deception  matt so as you step forward into the chamber  marisha this is not good  liam sunshine roll high  marisha im not good at this shit oh thats not bad 14 thats it 14 thats all i got 14 is  good for me  taliesin its dark  matt okay so thats your action as you say this to delilah her

none	 keyleth  marisha okay i have a 50foot movement i want to hit as many skeletons as i can by running  through them and catching them on fire  matt okay so with that you can do counting you can probably get this whole cluster here all  righty they all catch fire as you rush through you do get attacks of opportunity on you as you  rush by that is 15  marisha what am i against  matt whats your ac for your fire elemental  marisha hit  matt all right so thats 11 points 
none	 of slashing damage reduced to half because you take half  damage right  marisha yep so five  matt thats a 13  marisha miss no hit armor class is 13  matt another five points of slashing damage ten  marisha miss  matt eight  marisha miss  matt okay that one and that one that is a 15 from the minotaur skeleton  marisha hit  matt you take 17 points of slashing damage reduced to eight and the last one is a natural  20 so you take 22 points of slashing damage reduced to 
none	 11 and they are all set aflame all of  them take i believe fire damage from impacting you  marisha yep  matt so well say eight damage across the board for all of them all of them get hit with fire as  they swipe out at you including the giant minotaur that swings over you with this large  greataxe in its hands and bursts into flames as it does so awesome all right that ends your turn  keyleth delilah whos currently glaring at keyleth and the rest of you looks out and goes  of 
none	 course it would be you wouldnt it she takes a step back without breaking eye contact  goes finish your work foreign words and slams her hand down on the ground and you watch  as this sphere of rainbow color completely encompasses around the top of the ziggurat you  now see this large orb this dome of multicolored rainbows that flickers for a second and then  briefly becomes a singular color  laura its a giant  matt you see it is a giant prismatic sphere around the color you see now as it flickers for a 
none	  minute becomes stark red just deep ruby red  jon its so pretty look at it you guys  liam taste the rainbow  travis these people kill ducks lionel  jon gasps kill them all  matt percival scanlan what are you guys doing  taliesin scanlan you first my plan just went up the rainbow  sam all right ill step forward and i will is vax or vex near me vex is near me right  matt vex is near you yeah  sam i will inspire vex i will sing to her i will sing 
none	 singing you dont need anybody else  when i stand beside you i touch you elf whoa  laughter  sam something creepy  laura working your way back up  sam and then ill cast reverse gravity on everybody everybody in there all their shit  matt all righty whats the radius on that my templates are still back on the shelf can someone  grab my templates real fast that would be awesome  sam 50 feet  matt 50foot radius  sam 50 feet radius  matt oh thats going to get everybody in there including probably 
none	 keyleth  marisha i can take it im into this  matt you can fly though right  marisha i can fire hover  taliesin i have sticky feet right now so i aint going nowhere  matt reverse gravity perfect dexterity save across the board  whats the spell dc with the hand cone  sam 22  taliesin fuck their shit up  sam does it affect people in the dome  matt you dont know  taliesin well hear a thunk wont we  matt you see over here a number of other robed figures and one 
none	 that looks like its  heavily armored in the front as well a couple of small other cultists down on the sides but they  all apparently okay the armored one actually manages to grab the stonework and hold on  sam oh boy matts hating this  matt everyone else except for that one armored guard rises up and wham slams into the ceiling  50 feet up that is 5d10 points of damage 5d6 sorry thank you very much perfect  marisha is that including me or no  matt that would be including you  marisha okay 
none	  liam let me just reiterate we always appreciated scanlan  sam i just need to hear it more guys  matt 20 points of bludgeoning damage which completely destroys these skeletons that were  damaged earlier from the fire  liam so long pawns  matt all right are you maintaining it or letting them fall  sam maintain  matt all righty so everyone else is held in the air right now against the ceiling  sam the people inside the dome no  matt seem to be unaffected  sam oh that ziggurat  laura antimagic dome 
none	  sam ill move a little closer in  matt so over here next to pike  sam done percival  matt that ends scanlans turn percy what are you doing  taliesin im going to pull out bad news actually lets pull out animus this will be  funnier if im walking around that way which is always a fun thing to say theres that one guy  holding on right  matt theres one guy holding on yeah  taliesin theres one guy holding on im going to use my gun to make him drop an object of 
none	 my  choosing and that object is going to be the pyramid so just remembering how to do this  matt roll for an attack  taliesin roll for an attack thats 29  matt that will hit all right he has to make a strength saving throw  taliesin strength saving throw against 20  matt nope five plus five that is a no so he goes whoosh and slams into the ceiling as well  taking ooh that is 22 points of bludgeoning damage  marisha can keyleth clothesline him on the way up as a fire elemental 
none	  matt sure close enough you swoosh over there its fine more of a flavor element so all the  visible creatures you can see right now are held against the ceiling  taliesin okay is he still alive i dont suppose i have advantage to hit anything thats pinned to  the ceiling  matt im going to say for the purposes of falling up a lot of them are prone so you would actually  have disadvantage  taliesin so weird ill take it i hit the wrong thing there we are ill burn another point for  
none	 advantage and shoot him again just with a straight roll thats 19  matt that hits same armored guy  taliesin same guy thats nine points of damage plus three points of psychic damage  matt okay all right  taliesin and ill hit him again same thing hit him again this time im going to take a bonus for  a hex on him too for extra fun thats 27  matt yeah that hits  taliesin so thats not bad thats 17 points of damage plus three points of psychic damage and  five points of necrotic damage 
none	  matt nice youre just firing up at this figure the one shot sends it flying up into the ceiling  and id say even before it impacts as its still floating up in the air you shoot it once while  its still falling upward and then it slams into the ceiling and you get one final shot to hit it  while its there grunts across the top its hard to see if its really that hurt but its  currently a little wounded  taliesin yeah and hes got disadvantage on dexterity checks for now because thats 
none	 funny  matt are you going to move percival or are you going to stay where you are  taliesin im slowly going to make my way towards the ziggurat so im going to be actually walking  up on the wall so you can put me up on the little creases yeah im walking sideways as gravitys  reversed right now ill make my way as far as i can get towards the sphere  matt okay and that radius by the way is maintained as long as you concentrate on that so  anybody who walks into that 
none	 radius will have to make a dex save or be flung up into that so that  being the case ending scanlans turn and percys turn the cultists that are currently flung to the  ceiling are going to get up and run this way so theyre technically up on the ceiling right now  those two are going to continue their work you dont see whats in there grog youre up  travis is it me and chad  matt lets see here actually no i disagree they actually can take an action this turn from  that distance 
none	 so i need grog and pike to both make wisdom saving throws  laura are you both wise  ashley i have gnome cunning so i have advantage on wisdom  travis 14  matt 14  ashley what did you say it was wisdom 20  laura roll your advantage you get advantage  ashley maybe i dont need it  laura try it maybe youll roll a natural 20  matt advantage for which one  ashley i have gnome cunning i have advantage on wisdom intelligence charisma saving throws  matt just in general  ashley i 
none	 guess so  matt against magic i think it was so yeah both of you guys shrug off the effect you feel the  magic try to take hold over the inside of your brain and your muscles seize up and you manage to  shrug it off its a familiar feeling it is one that youre familiar with as well pike it is a  hold person attempt on both of you  ashley i know what you did i know what you were trying to do  matt all right that ends their turn grog youre up  
none	 travis okay where does that sphere of vertical influence start  matt youre not entirely certain grog  travis awesome im going to go into a rage and haul ass along this wall  matt okay as you rush into this wall here i need you to make a dexterity saving throw  travis i have advantage on those 14  matt grog you start running and then yelps go flying up into the ceiling  sam oh shit it affects the area  travis screams  matt you take 17 points of bludgeoning  travis i raged at the 
none	 beginning  matt so half that youre now locked on the ceiling as well however that does put you in  melee range and prone with one of the cultists on the ceiling  travis totally meant to do that ill attack  matt youre upsidedown on the ceiling the guy who cast a spell and it didnt work on you watched  you tumble up land get up and stare him down in his face  travis hi  matt his hood falls off you see a guy whos staring at you now with  one eye plucked out 
none	 of its socket  travis might as well make a matching one reckless natural 20  cheering  matt roll some damage  travis so i rolled a ten two more of these seven 31 11 42  matt okay you smile at him bring the axe back and you completely were talking tree trunk he  slides over and his body attaches to the ceiling and collapses against that blood splattering out  from his midsection it seems really gross in a sense you still have at half movement about 20  feet to run across  travis yeah 
none	 ill keep trying to come to this wall  matt this wall okay thats about as far as you get but you dont have range with your axe  travis thats my turn  matt okay finishes grogs turn lionel youre over here currently  jon i move forward and i jump into the radius so i can float up too and as im flying i say  ill save you grog  travis come on buddy  matt do you go into a rage first it will reduce your impact damage as you land  jon wait what  
none	 taliesin you take less damage  matt if you want to be raging first youll take less damage from the impact  jon yeah you know what lets rage  matt okay you joyfully leap into the sky  jon its the duck rage  matt you take 16 reduced to half so you take eight points of bludgeoning damage as you slam  into the ground at the top and you stand up and theres about five feet between you and grog and  one of the cultists is there right in front of you whos like shit  
none	 jon i rage  matt do you want to attack him go for it  jon i think the antigravity is screwing me up three plus 12  matt three plus 12 still hits actually  jon he does it clumsily  matt your first strike is 2d6 plus ten damage  jon seven 17  matt 17 points of slashing damage as you pull your greataxe up and rake past you see his chest  split open and he grunts pulls back hes still alive and as he looks up at you from under the hood he is  
none	 also missing one of his eyes pants  jon second attack rage bonus action  matt you have an extra attack as a barbarian so you get a second attack  jon okay  taliesin d20  jon do the same thing  taliesin natural 20 now roll 4d6  matt roll 4d6  travis stop touching him  taliesin hes so plush though its really nice whoa does he get to reroll ones  sam oh thats a one  taliesin does he get to reroll a one  matt he does because of his great weapon fighting yeah 
none	  taliesin reroll it better  jon so its 17 plus ten 27  matt okay the first strike cuts him across the chest pants rears back oh that wasnt enough  and with a second halfassed swipe he goes down and spills out all across the ceiling that  cultist is done all righty that finishes your turn taryon  sam doty stay here ill jump on the broom i cast fly on no i dont have to cast fly  im on a broom  laura its hard to keep track of three characters  sam well matt 
none	 does it all the time  taliesin the walls are tall enough that you can put that above people and it wont be a problem  matt possibly well find out where are you going tary  sam im going to fly straight in to the steps  matt all right so youre doing a dash or just your movement  sam can i get there in one fly  matt whats the speed of the broom  sam its 40 right  matt you can get there thats as close as you can get with one movement  taliesin 
none	 youre close though you can throw something at it  sam i cant get all the way there so ill cast something shit its a prismatic thing right  matt right now you have this ruby brightred dome thats glowing with light right now  sam would a prismatic spray beat a prismatic spray probably not right  matt i dont know what do you think  sam shit im not going to risk it im going to point straight up  is there anyone right above me  matt yes actually these guys here are  on the ceiling 
none	 right now anything you see there  are on the ceiling currently  sam and im up a bit so i could throw something at them i guess drop it ill drop a thing  of fire up there alchemic fire a little pot  matt at which one  sam can i get two of them it has a fivefoot radius  matt yes you can hit these two  sam great ill go for both of them  matt all right so the skeleton and guy get to make whats the dc  sam 17  matt 17 
none	 unfortunately the cultist makes it skeleton does not so the cultist dodges out of  the way on the ceiling it smashes on the ground by the skeleton and bursts into flames how much  damage does it deal to the skeleton  sam im 15th level or 16th level  matt 15th  sam okay 5d6  matt 5d6 fire damage to the skeleton  sam 16  matt 16 points of fire damage that skeleton fire consumes it its still currently standing  and now the flames are licking through its ribcage that ends your turn  sam 
none	 i will as a bonus action cast sanctuary am i within 30 feet of any of my friends  matt right now nope  sam on myself  matt all righty vax youre up  liam boots on poof go the wings i have two actions left its really hard to see how far am  i from skeletal minotaur  matt right there youre approximately 40 feet 45  liam and nowhere on the board are any of my allies within melee combat range of any enemy  matt nope anyone that was killed whatever they were fighting

town	 sarenraes embrace descend from the darkness of  the inside of your eyelids you see the angelic form of her flaming aura come down and her hands  touch the sides of your cheek she turns your head around towards the orb and where previously you  saw the little black dot instead you see a large oval doorway around it it is flickering madly  like a hundred spinning razors around the edges but just beyond it you can see what appears to be  a desolate gray landscape what looks to be a scattering of city buildings across 
none	 this broken  black shadowland and in the center a singular black obsidian tower that rises up to where you  cant quite see the top from your current angle and she gets down really close to the side of your  ear you feel the warmth of her divine breath against your face she says this is the destiny  this needs to stop only terror will come through this  ashley we have to go there  matt whatever way you can our reach cannot go beyond the divine gate  ashley if i go there will you 
none	 not be able to go with me  matt i will be diminished if at all able to  ashley okay thank you  matt and her finger touches your head and she kisses the top of your forehead and you feel the  warm presence again and she withdraws as she withdraws the cold is even harder with her  absence because now the proximity of that shadow of this room just this general sense of negative  energy and death that emanates from this direction behind you as soon as you watch her light vanish  and you 
none	 open your eyes again youre chilled to the bone  ashley okay well its a doorway and we have to go there its the only way to stop this  laura stop what  ashley i dont know  laura well we cant go through now  taliesin cant we  marisha is it just like this now like the ziggurat in whitestone  taliesin i dont know cant we  travis yeah we can  laura oh fuck but were not even healed they just went through were going to go through and  just die immediately  sam 
none	 we have to go at least find out if the spells are still affecting us  if we go through and pikes dumb  ashley maybe we should back out  marisha the last time i put my hand in the sphere when it was black it nearly tore me apart we  could try again  laura it was just a doorway  ashley it was a doorway and it opened into a city of sorts and in the middle  was an obsidian tower  laura thats what i saw through the other one  ashley okay  
none	 liam do i feel anything sense anything  matt in what way  liam from my patron  matt do you wish to try to concentrate there  liam yeah  matt make a wisdom check d20 add your wisdom modifier  liam use my last luck of the day same thing its shit seven  matt seven you concentrate and you get the sense that the proximity of this orb and something about  the nature of this whole occurrence is interfering with your connection with your deity temporarily  you try and reach out to her but nothing 
dung	 is returning your call  travis yeah lets step out of the range see what happens  laura can we back out and see how far the range goes is it the same distance as our ziggurat  matt so you drag a body you said  laura yeah one of the bodies  travis which one the dark paladin  liam yeah that asshole  matt so you take the black guard drag it behind you the rest of you all continue down the  pathway you get to about where that tintersection was and pike  your brain 
none	 goes numb once more  ashley laughing no  marisha keyleth goes over to pike and puts her palm on her head and casts greater restoration  matt the spell immediately loses its hold and you regain control of your facilities  ashley disaster averted keyleth i throw my arms around her and i kiss her on the forehead  on the cheek  laura just full on her lips  ashley sorry im just so intense  marisha the amount youve saved us its nothing ive learned it from you  ashley okay do we need to talk to 
none	 this dead person  travis yeah  marisha no  travis what we dont need to talk to this dead person  marisha sorry i was answering a different question continue  travis do it  ashley ill cast speak with dead  matt speak with dead you watch the plate armor rouse ever so slightly as the fresh corpse begins  to clink and tense against the metal plates you hear the creaking sound of breath trying to escape  from the reedy thin slit where apparently part of the dagger blow that you had shoved in the back 
none	  of its neck went through and cut part of the vocal cards  laura eww fucking gross  matt you have its attention  ashley is this one of the ones where his eye is missing is he one of those guys  matt as you glance closer to the black guard because the helmets still on youd have to pull  the helmet off  ashley hes the guy with the yeah pull it off for sure  matt pull the helmet off its missing its eye  sam by the way while this is going on im

none	 and the skin is stretched tight against  the skull while once living this had some sort of necrotic twisting to its flesh whether it be  by proximity or practice but the jaws open gasping through the jaw doesnt move you hear  the escaping thin air forming words that say you need one of the crafted stones to pass unharmed  laura or the blade the sphere  matt gasping or be hearty enough to survive its ravishing doorway  ashley who do you serve  matt we are the remnants small parts of the whole given purpose 
none	 to come together and remake  the vessel of the undying king  ashley why do you have one eye missing  matt to bequeath ourselves of the highest remnant order to the whispered one is to gift our  sight like he did be granted knowledge he keeps  laura theres only two more questions left  liam suggestion how did ripley return  laura not ripley delilah  liam thats what i meant to say delilah  ashley was that delilah  laura and liam yeah  liam how did delilah return  ashley i have one job

none	 there anything that delilah is afraid of  laura nah he wouldnt know that  ashley what are your plans what are the remnants plans  matt the whisper becomes a slight chuckle chuckling his return is nigh the whispered one  will come his acolytes will help him complete his destiny through the ritual of seeding from within  the gate he will rise the solitary tyrant and lord of exandria and with the sole crown of  creation guarded upon his head we who were his body will be rewarded with life eternal at his side  gasping
