i also wanted to give a big thanks out to obsidian they actually approved my /none/ use of  the pillars of eternity soundtrack in our music for the show so now ill be able to use elements  of their soundtrack for our game so thank you guys and i guess lets get into this game so  where we left off our party of adventurers vox machina had broken a few rules in the city of  vasselheim and had actually infracted upon a contract for a guild of creature hunters known as  the slayers take and this group essentially told vox machina that either they could go and be  arrested for /none/ this and put on trial for breaking the law or they could go and join the guild as  such could be included and written onto the contract and everything would be fine so they  decided to go that route they inquired with the huntmaster and she basically told the party that  they could join after they went through a trial where they had to complete a contract however  she handchose and divided the party into two separate smaller groups the first group being  the one that began playing with us last week in which we /none/ had the illustrious scanlan percy vex  and grog paired up with two new adventurers one of which was zahra the tiefling warlock who also  is a prospective interested person to join the guild the slayers take and felicias character  lyra the human wizard who somehow became a member of the guild and is assigned on her  firstever excursion to lead this group towards the end of their contract now you the audience  chose the creature which they were going to hunt and you voted on an adult white dragon so theyve  been hunting that /town/  laura i didnt realize the audience chose that  felicia thanks guys  laughter  matt so after stalking your way up the glasswalk road to the north of the city of vasselheim  through the vesper timberlands through the cold weather as you continue to travel northward on the  word of a crazed gentleman in a tavern somewhere who supposedly saw a dragon you managed to knock  over your flask you managed to see such a dragon skulking through the skies and actually attacking  near where you were staying while you were sleeping a group /none/ of orcs and some ogrish creature  and a dire wolf attacked your group you managed to slaughter the encroaching evils rather rapidly  in a daring display of buttflap longjohn percy  laughter  matt some majestic combat prowess you guys managed to completely eliminate you interrogated one of  the orcs before grog decided to take his head off it pushed you north northwest direction within  the forest itself you managed to come upon what looked to be a perpetual blizzard that was blowing  around this mountain range and the dragon was sighted again taking its /none/ rest to the north part of  this mountain you pushed through the forest managed to avoid a few possible dangerous situations  thanks to your ranger guiding you through her favored terrain eventually coming upon the base  of this mountain range now you looked above and you saw what looked like the entrance to a cavern  where at least the dragon seems to fly in and out of its a ways up the mountain and there was a  smaller cavern towards the base of the mountain you went to inquire what was in there at which /none/  point out of nowhere a giant rock made of solid ice and stone was flung out of the forest  slamming into vex knocking her onto her ass and doing a decent amount of physical damage  laura 30 30 points  matt 30 points physical damage to the ranger at which point two frost giants seemed to one coming  out of that cavern another seemed to be stalking through the woods approached the party  and that is where we left off so to begin this i would like everyone to roll initiative  felicia but theyre /none/ friendly they look friendly  sam  lets try reasoning with them whoa thats not bad  felicia im not going to go last this time gasps  sam theres a lot of gasping going on  felicia its not horrible but its not sharp gasp  matt all right so  sam wait does travis not  matt roll for grog  laura roll for grog  matt roll for grogs initiative  laura i rolled 18 for me oh thats good 19 for grog  matt all right so we have 25 to 20 anyone  taliesin 28  /none/ laura what  sam he rolled a natural 20  taliesin i rolled another natural 20  laura those dice are magic  taliesin i sacrificed a small child to these dice  matt so percys up first anybody else above 20  felicia i rolled a 20 but i have a negative two initiative  matt okay 19 or 18  laura 19 for grog 18 for vex  matt and also for lyra  felicia 18 buddies  matt chuckling thats sweet so 15 to ten  sam 15  laura these are pretty good initiatives  mary /none/ 13  sam hey then were all above 13 its pretty good this bodes well  mary i have no initiative whatsoever  laughter  matt all right thatll do so at the top of the round as one giant has pulled itself out of the  cavern and begins shouting over in giant about the intruders the secondary one that comes stalking  out of the forest both of them with these giant axes that are currently held on the side of  leather belts roars give a bellowing scream and go charging into the fray at the top /none/ of the  round though percy is ready what have you got  taliesin what is that strange orange thing right here  matt this is actually a tree  taliesin thats a tree okay good so thats cover  matt yeah this rock and these boulders here have some cover but from a giant who has a very large  perspective maybe not as much as youd think  taliesin okay so is there any way i can maybe get some partial cover right over here  matt you could move over this way yes  taliesin yeah so /none/ ive got cover from the tree from this one until he moves  but i can see this guy  matt correct  taliesin it is bad news time im going to bust out bad news and take a shot  matt all right so rip out bad news uses one of your attacks second attack prepares it youre  ready to fire go ahead and shoot  taliesin all right theyre pretty big so im going to take the negative five to my attack bonus  and see what that does thats a 21  matt 21 will hit /none/  taliesin thats a good shot oh yeah thats 17 27 plus 33 points of damage  matt 33 points of damage nice so you hear this loud ringing explosion that echoes through this  small valley at the base of the mountain and from out the corner of your eye its the first time  youve seen this weapon do its wonders you see a flash of light a plume of smoke goes up and you see  this impossibly fast blast of some projectile go slamming into the shoulder of the giant over here  thats currently reaching /none/ for a rock it pushes him back against the wall which prevents him from  falling over and he catches himself looks back and you can see theres a small crater in the  armor where a little bit of blood begins to pour out and a little bit of smoke seems to be pouring  out of the impact snarls and yells gives out a really angry yell you can see like spittle that  begins to shake loose and spray from his mouth out of frustration that the end of your turn  taliesin that is the end /none/ of my turn yeah i am now going maybe i shouldnt have done that  laughter  felicia it was very impressive it was very impressive  matt all right grogs up first  laura grog voice grog  sam grog voice would like  laura grog voice no grog doesnt want to rage grog shouts out in giant wait my giant masters  were killed by a white dragon which we think is here will you help us fight him  matt okay so as grog stands there shouting this out to both sides to the two giants i /dung/ want to  have grog go ahead and roll a persuasion check  laura okay i am going to use grogs dice  matt yes lets do this proper this is customary  laura it is proper wait okay thats not his that is mine  taliesin grog voice i would like to negotiate  laura okay well that is good he is really happy that i am playing him  because i rolled a one for grog  sam it might work  laughter  laura i think i should not okay wait  mary doesnt grog get two /none/ actions or no  laura thats his action  matt he is not putting up any aggressive action  laura does he get advantage however because he is speaking giant and hes in the cold  matt no  laughter  matt because you have an entire band of seemingly advancing and armed individuals that are currently  stalking towards what appears to be the home of these individuals so unfortunately no they seem  unfazed and the one at the back seems almost partially amused at this plea and you can see as  he takes his axe and /none/ puts it up against his shoulder and runs it across the leather in a very  aggressive intimidating fashion as he stalks forward out of the forest  laura grog voice can grog move at all  matt yeah would you like grog to move it would be easier  laura grog voice where is he  matt he is right here he is hard to miss where would you like grog to move  there is a giant rock there  laura he is going to stay there  matt okay grog is going to stay up against the /none/ rock his axe across the front right that ends  grogs turn vex youre up  laughter  laura a moment of silence for that horrible thing i just witnessed  matt you are over here you just got up off the ground after being slammed with a boulder and you  have trinket there  laura i am very hurt can i get up am i prone  matt in the process youve gotten to your feet as they lurched forward and began shouting at each  other about the intruders so you are on your feet  laura /none/ okay i am going to cast hunters mark  matt hunters mark on  laura on the one that took a little damage already and then i am going to shoot him all  these are for like really large groups of people i am going to shoot him three times can i shoot  him three times  matt you have two attacks  laura im going to shoot him two times this was good times this was fun you guys 14 for that  that probably doesnt hit 14 also doesnt hit the second time oh my god /none/ what is happening  laughter  sam she just disappeared  mary vex vex stay with us vex  matt so as you get to your feet you look over your shoulder you point your finger out and as  you squint down you use your ranger focus to make sure this guy is your quarry and you take a quick  scope of his body parts youre like those are the areas that will make him weakest as you go to  pull your arrow you can feel a kink in your shoulder the impact of the rock seems /none/ to have  affected you you release the first arrow and its just slightly off mark the second one you pull  back and as you release it it actually splinters off his shield as he knocks it out of the air  laura i am going to run over to cover what is that other side  matt that is one of the mountain outcroppings  laura yeah i am going to hide in that little thing and go trinket hide with me  matt okay trinket moves up bear moan all right and thats your turn  laura /none/ thats all of it  matt laughs all right lyra youre up  felicia okay i am freaked out right now these are very large individuals i have only read about  them and they smell slightly like feet so i am going to that is a stench that is like an  athletes foot commercial waiting to happen so i am going to take 10d6 and do disintegrate  matt go for it  felicia i mean it seems excessive but theyre very large men one two three four five that  one he looks like a bull in /none/ the netherregions  matt so which one this one or this one  felicia i dont think i can reach that guy  matt whats the distance on it  felicia oh boy  matt at your spell sheet  felicia i shouldve written that down disintegrate oh there it is 60 feet  matt 60 feet yeah theyre both within range  felicia oh gosh well i should probably hit the wounded one that always makes rpg sense right  matt so for that one do you have to make an actual spell attack roll  felicia no i /none/ dont i think its force damage  matt thats right you just point at it and he has to roll a saving throw  felicia oh yay look at that six six six  sam well dont say that  laughter  matt all this time trying to fight the stigma of dnd and there we go  mary talking to my people here  felicia all right thats 20 plus now youre all staring at me 30 40 points of damage  sam whoa  matt thats a total of 40 plus 40  felicia 40 plus 40  /none/ matt yeah disintegrate and he failed his saving throw  taliesin yeah  felicia in your anus thats what she yells shes like in your anus  matt so as she shouts she points her finger out theres a little poof of arcane energy on her  finger and a tiny sickly green ray of energy just streaks forth from her finger the giant  looks at it awkwardly and in the split second it hits him in the front of his chest and suddenly  the armor in front of him turns to dust and you can see his /none/ flesh beginning to just disappear in  front of him gasps and suddenly tries to gasp for air as you see part of its jaw beginning to  just turn to sand and its actually struggling in a series of pain and its still standing but you  can see a large part of its body now is just missing it looks like it got its almost like a  portion of it rotted right before you but theres no actual necrosis its just gone flesh is  missing from a large part of its body it looks like its /none/ doing really poorly it lurches forward  and one of its arms is not working as well and it looks at you with a look of confusion frustration  and how could you its incredulous in its torturous pain  felicia and i go gibberish in giant and its the only thing i know in giant and i think it  says you are my foe and i actually say my cat is your friend  matt its head turns even further to the side as the tongue lolls out of where the cheek once was  felicia take that /none/  matt chuckles its angry white eyes glaring aggressively at you do you wish to move or would  you like to stay where you are  felicia oh i think im going to duck behind that little outcropping i have  matt over here  felicia yeah no behind that little rock oh where am i oh im over there yeah im going to  get oh boy just stand there im just too flushed right now i cant go anywhere this is  too situational for me  matt all right well chuckles this very unhappy giant is /none/ going to reach over with his one  good arm the other ones clutching the axe it reaches over and grabs another rock off the ground  that it can find nearby and whoosh flings it at you  felicia i should have moved  laughter  matt that is a 16 whats your armor class  felicia 13  matt yeah you unable to really move out of the way you look over and just watch it come toward  you as it slowly spins in the air time seems to slow as you make no intent to shift /none/ out of the  way whack it slams into you physical pain not hitting in as the immediate look of the sight of  white your vision is knocked to nothingness briefly you end up taking  mary no lyra no  matt okay you take 32 points of bludgeoning damage  felicia whoa that is a very intense amount of damage for a tiny woman okay  laura you should avoid those boulders in the future  matt and as soon as you recover from it your vision clarifies and youre able to see everything  before you and /none/ you see that same giant is stalking up right into your face with its axe in  its bad hand it switches it into its good hand and rears it up preparing itself for another  round that ends that giants turn its going to go five six and move in between the two of you  you guys zahra and scanlan as you see this happening you hear the heavy steps heavy  footfalls behind you and you look over your shoulder as the second giant comes up with the  shield in one arm axe is going to /none/ go ahead and giant swing towards the two of you that is going  to be a 19 to hit on you scanlan  sam oh yeah  matt and zahra that is going to be a thats a 25 all right  laughter  matt 27 points of slashing damage to you scanlan ooh all right and that is 31 points of  slashing damage to you zahra as it just whack cleaves through the both of you you are almost  knocked off your feet from the sheer blow most of the armor takes the damage but you /none/ can feel a  heavy bruise and underneath your armor you can feel a little bit of the blood beginning to soak through  from the severe impact part of the armor plating might have cut into part of your torso grunts  but you right yourself there that ends their turn that brings us to scanlan  sam okay hey question if i hold a turn do i hold the whole turn can i hold my action but do  the bonus action how does it work  matt you got to take all your turn at once you /none/ can hold your initiative meaning  you can wait to activate your turn later in the tier but you cant piecemeal  your actions  sam okay then i am going to just move i am going to act i am going to do things so i turn  to the guy who just hit me and i am going to cast dominate person on him i will sing some sort of  song to dominate him with  matt i will say dominate person is effective against humanoids  sam gasps really  matt dominate monster would be  /none/ sam theyre not humanoid  matt they are not they are considered giants they are a different species  you would know that  sam i would know that well then i guess i wont do that  matt you turn and your instinct is there and youre like these are a little out of your reach  as far as that spell is concerned  sam okay  laughter  mary it is a very short show tonight  sam yeah okay well then we just die  laughter  matt youve got options  sam yeah no i /none/ have options ill be fine should i go for the guy who ill do blows  raspberry ill cast lightning bolt on him thats always a good goto  matt so as you fumble with the idea of what spell would work you release a bolt of lightning up  towards it it streaks into the front of its chest and shoulder area you can see its muscles tense  and shake from the sheer amount of electricity that courses into it it does not make that saving  throw not with a five so go ahead and roll your /none/ damage  sam is it six or eight  matt its 8d6  sam thank you okay six six four what is that  felicia six  sam oh really oh thats awesome now i lost track 32  matt 32 points of damage nice so as you release the torrent of electrical energy it courses  through the body and ends up streaking off into the snowy blizzardy sky behind the giant from the  upward angle it grunts shakes from the impact and then rights itself and looks down at you with  a really angry face you /dung/ can see as it opens its mouth this light blue and dark teeth on the  bottom of its beardcovered jaw mist and steam tend to pour out of its mouth but not like heated  steam this is like a cold air itself that it seems to emanate from it its pale whitishblue  hair slightly framing its form up close at its sheer size this is a very intimidating creature  as it just stares down looming over you now with smoke pouring off its shoulder where you impacted  it with the lightning bolt do you want /none/ to do any  sam i would like to inspire our new fellow zahra with a quick little ditty singing ooh  you so scary ooh you so scary ooh you so scary you fighty long time  laughter  matt all right so you go ahead and take a d10 inspiration dice which means whenever you have  to roll an attack roll or saving throw you can add a d10 to the result you get if you dont think  its going to make it  you dont roll it now but you just have it on reserve /none/ whenever you want to use it  mary love it  sam and if i move away from him hell hit me  matt hell get an attack of opportunity yes  sam can i snuggle between his legs and maybe hell forget im there  felicia hes hung like a horse  taliesin youre going to hit yourself in the head  mary swing on it man swing on it  laughter  mary yes yes scanlan  matt do you want to try and do that  sam it might anger him or it might entice him  /none/ laughter  sam ill just stay put  matt all right zahra youre up  mary all right i have a question do they understand english  matt you are not aware actually  laura but he said intruder when we came in  matt you heard him say it in giant it was understood by grog that it was intruder  mary all right theyre both within about 30 feet of me yes  matt yes theyre both within 30 feet of you  mary all right im going to use one of my skills that i have which /none/ it doesnt expel a spell slot  and use awakened mind and touch them both with telekinesis and in doing so i shall cast mass  suggestion and i shall say to them you will take us to your enemy the white dragon and there we  shall slay it together then you shall return us here safely where we shall part as friends bonded  forever in the slaying of a common enemy  matt all right as youre looking out at the two of them you release this energy speaking through  your mind reaching out to theirs /none/ what is the dc of your spell it should be at the top of your spell  list the difficulty class  sam spell save dc top right  laura spell save dc is a 17  matt 17 all right so both of them seem to  laura can you add your inspiration add your inspiration  matt inspiration has to be added to a roll  mary my charisma is added to any spell that i cast  matt well thats included with the dc there so both of them reach up and grab their faces one  /none/ with its messed up partially disintegrated hand and falls back on its back foot and both of them  look at the group in confusion there definitely seems to be some sort of interference with their  current actions based on this spell there is a conflict within them thats as much as i can tell  you right now at the moment thats your action do you want to do anything else you can still  move you still have a bonus action if you want  mary what do you mean bonus action  matt your hex is /none/ a bonus action but that is a spell as well  mary if i move away from them though  laura he can hit you  taliesin if hes going to hit you he might not  laura thats true your spell might have worked  mary i shall go and protect scanlan underneath the legs of that giant  matt so you move in to help defend scanlan  mary hes so tiny i love little guys i always have  sam shes a mother figure  matt all right so both of them seem to be looking around /none/ themselves slightly confused and  taking in some sort of strange circumstance percy youre up  taliesin im going to hold my turn  matt okay percys holding initiative grog  laura should i say in giant in grog voice what say you lets fight this bastard together  matt all right they look at grog confused look at each other again thats grogs turn vex  laura seriously while everybodys having a conversation i would like to take  a healing potion  matt all right go ahead and take one of those  laura okay how much do /none/ i take for a superior  matt superior superior is 8d4 plus eight its quite a bit  laura it is so just regular healing potion for now which is what 2d8  matt a regular is 2d4 plus two  laura yay thats good  matt lyra  felicia im confused but i do not feel good i might throw up so im going to hold my turn to  see what happens  matt go ahead and make a constitution saving throw  felicia oh good  sam oh for the barf  felicia oh its a five /none/ constitution five its a ten  matt you covertly do your best to not reveal to the entire group that you make a little  greenishbrown snow  laughter  matt it is the most adorable barfing sound you guys have ever heard though the combination of  the stress and the smell its been a harrowing experience for lyra in these past few minutes at  this point in time as it comes to the giants turn the one who is messed up looks over to the  other and sighs puts the axe into his belt loop and /none/ the other also one puts its axe in the belt  loop and they glare at the rest of the group and say in giant gibberish and any of you speak  giant or just grog  laura grog  matt grog translates essentially they say we will take you but it is at your own folly  laura in grog voice theyll take us but it is at our own folly  sam take us as in grog can you ask them take us as in lead us or on their back  laura strangled gibberish which translates to /none/ take us as in lead us or carry us on your back  matt they both chuckle to themselves and they start walking in towards the cavern  laura wait can we rest a little before we go fight this thing so we can get spell slots back  and heal  matt thats up to you guys  laura can we yes yes  felicia up to 24 hours this one lasts the whole day yeah can we  matt it lasts for 24 hours  mary mass suggestion lasts for 24 hours  sam oh that is good /none/ information  mary oh and very important none of us can damage these two giants anything else can were fine  but should any of us damage it the spell is poof  laura are they going to fight with us grog will you ask them if theyre going to fight with us  gibberish  matt how does it go again  laura repeats previous gibberish  matt right one of them looks over the shoulder as its walking into the cavern and puts its hand on  the top and leans over and its voice and i will /none/ say from this point forth it is translated to make  it easier  sam just like in hunt for red october  matt yeah basically we take you but that is as much as you get the rest is your own choice  perhaps the dragon will eat you thatll keep it satiated for a while  it steps inside the cavern  laura grog voice i think thats a no  felicia yeah and i say speaks gibberish my cat is your friend  taliesin bless you  matt laughs as you say that one walks inside the /none/ one that you partially disintegrated earlier  steps out and goes spitting noise and spits a what in midair looks like liquid and then  shattering shatters into almost like crystalline ice as it hits the ground on a rock  felicia it is just rude he smells so much like feet  sam well mass suggest that they take a bath later  taliesin lets take a breather for a moment collect ourselves  laura i wish i wouldnt have wasted a healing potion just then because we can take some  felicia we can heal our 1d6 plus /none/ three  matt so as you guys step inside the cavern you guys are taking a short rest currently  sam short rest  matt all right so the giants are just sitting there waiting arms crossed against the wall  talking quietly to each other as the rest of you sit down and bandage your wounds you tend to your  adrenaline as it slowly wears off and suddenly the pain starts to set in from some of the wounds  youve taken so you guys can use as many hit dice as you want to heal yourselves  /none/ mary so what do i do  laura you roll a d8 you can roll up to 11d8 plus two for each time  sam hey dm  matt yes  sam how many hit points do i have  matt you havent taken damage at this point  sam have they increased at all  matt that is true you leveled up after the last one so with this short rest i will say go ahead  and roll an additional for a bard i think it is a d8 correct  sam i dont know  matt whats /none/ your hit dice number  sam d8  matt and whats your constitution  sam 15 plus two  matt all right so go ahead and roll a d8 plus two to it  sam four  matt all right so you add four hit points to your total hit point maximum  welcome to level 11 scanlan  cheering and singing super mario victory ditty  matt you also get access to your first 6thlevel spell  mary what  laura what get some stuff before we fight a dragon yo  sam i got it already i am /none/ ready to rock  matt good good choice you take the next half an hour or so to rest up you still used your  disintegrate you need to do a whole nights rest to get that back  felicia oh i dont get it its six spell levels  matt it is six spell levels you can get back on a short rest  felicia short rest recover six spell levels because i have arcane recovery so i can actually  get that back  matt singing wizards are awesome  laura grog voice grog would like to take /none/ his chain of returning off of one of the axes he had  it on and put onto the firebrand warhammer that he took off of that dwarf in kraghammer  matt all righty i like it  laura the mean guy he took it off  matt off of that was king murghol i think wasnt it the duergar king you fought in the  underdark  mary i have a question so i rolled to get my health back and i got more hit points than i had  before  matt you cant go more than your /none/ maximum youre at full hit points now  taliesin i want to borrow grog for just a second and ask these two if theyve encountered the  dragon before and what its disposition is anything we should know  matt i want you to go ahead and i will say through grog this is going to be interesting  since grog is translating im going to go ahead and have you roll a persuasion check  felicia wrong dice why did you use that dice  taliesin i was feeling weak ten  matt ten and i want you to /none/ roll a persuasion check for grog with disadvantage  laura great oh that was a good roll come on also good roll  felicia it wasnt a good roll i see a face there  taliesin it was a one wasnt it  laura it was a one  matt all the crits were last week  taliesin this is my fault this is all my fault  felicia you are a plague your good fortune is a plague upon your friends  laura travis is going to be so pissed when he gets here  matt i know  /none/ sam hell be dead by the time he gets here  laura his flight landed i got a text his flight has landed hes on his way  matt great awesome as grog finishes translating gibberish to the giants the giants chuckle to  themselves and the other one says down to him what he translates for you the equivalent of  theres no help here they killed our people but were alive because we serve it well bring you  like we promised like we brought all the others  laura they serve the dragon  felicia can we /none/ look around are there any dragon tips around  matt you took a rest inside the cavern as you just entered the mountain and at this point as you  guys step up the giants are leading you further into the cavern  mary may i talk to him as well  matt you know giant  mary no through grog i have telekinesis so can i speak to one of them  matt well telekinesis and telepathy are different things  mary oh i mean i have awakened mind  matt oh right so you can speak directly to /none/ their minds  mary yes your people have been persecuted for so long and you have lost so many of the female  version of you and your children and you serve them now do you want to live as slaves  matt we want to live  mary so to live as a slave is better than  matt to not live at all  mary we are offering you the opportunity to stop your servitude to end it forever  matt grunts they keep walking  laura what  matt well see how this plays out this is /none/ a process here you guys heavily failed some early  persuasion rolls here theyre in a very negative position with you right now  laura sorry about that  felicia lets not bring it up again i love your hair  sam its really cool  matt so about 200 feet further into this cavern the tunnel opens up into a gargantuan natural rock  chamber coated in ice crystals across the entirety of the rounded crag in the ceiling you  can see now as the light youre bringing into by the way is anyone bringing a source of /dung/ light  other than the torchlight  laura yes grog lights his blazing axe  mary and i cast light on my dark dragon staff  matt all right so between the whoosh now the fire that is now burning off of the warhammer and  your light spell you can see as you enter following these giants there are definitely the  remnants of a village here a village that was designed on the scale of these giants and  while many of these structures still stand it is eerily quiet as you step inside as you begin to /none/  step further into the center of this cavern you see many of these structures have been smashed and  destroyed and there is a layer of ice and snow that has been carried in from various blizzard  winds or just the internal temperature in this room and the room is extremely cold with the  little bit of light you have everyones breath is very clearly visible with each puff into the air  around and you swear that in a few pockets here it is so cold that you can hear the moisture from your  breath /none/ coalesce and then shatter on the ground you all bundle up even tighter  with your various furs  laura i snuggle very close to trinket  matt trinket snuggles very close to you because trinket while made for this type of temperature  is still uncomfortably cold even at this point  sam did lyra give me  felicia i did i gave you my stone my transmutation stone which helps you resist cold  sam wow i feel so warm and cuddly  felicia well dont brag about it oh my gosh my mom told me never bring /none/ well shes dead but  before she died she told me if you cant bring one for everybody dont bring any so just be  quiet about it  sam okay im sorry i was just distracted because were in a dire situation and i miss the  love of my life pike im sure you cant identify with that  felicia oh no i was just thinking the other day just outside the cavern if aldor was here  sam aldor  felicia yes did i tell you about him  sam a little  felicia he smells like /none/ sandalwood and dismissiveness but thats okay  well get over that  sam well we have something in common then and thank you for your stone of warmth  or whatever it was  felicia its a cold resistance  sam ill just call it a stone of warmth  matt there is no character class more dangerous in dnd than mother  laughter  matt do not have children if you are ever in a fantasy genre or anything  you aint getting past 30  mary may i again sorry use awakened mind to ask the giant what /none/ happened here  matt as they begin walking through and looking about one of them starts giving you these images  and its less of a language and its more of a series of memories and you see visions of a time  not long ago months even years this relatively thriving village of frost giants that had  essentially claimed this mountain as their own for generations hunting in the nearby vesper  timberland occasionally harrowing the traveling merchant band heading up the glasswalk path or  various other entities that live in this forest theyre not by any /none/ means a good people they exist  and they take what they want but it appears that not long ago this dragon decided that it wanted to  live here instead and you see visions of it stalking through the tunnels carving its way  through the ice and ambushing this frost giant village you see visions of it tearing into  families of them and freezing them on the spot which is interesting because you see these giants  seem pretty welladapted to ice and cold weather it seems it is less of a freezing them  physically and /none/ more of locking them into place and as you see these visions you begin to step  further into this village and you can see there are spires large spires of crystallized ice and  loosely within the shadows of the ice you can see what looks like the suffocated forms of frost  giants that are locked in that position under many feet of ice you see most of this village brought  to its knees and destroyed murdered eaten or imprisoned and these two essentially chosen to  survive and given the order to bring what this creature /none/ wants  mary theres only two of you left  matt you get this sense of sadness and fear but also a sense of a lack of any other option  mary oh how i wish we could release you from these bonds  laura is there a way to like melt the spires whispers i interrupted you  mary to release them  felicia they are dead in there though right  mary no i know but at least maybe they could do you have some burial ritual or anything that  you would like to or do these /none/ stand as a painful remembrance for you  matt there is a moment where it seems almost like its going to answer and then the mind closes off  suddenly there is a defensiveness and these entities you get the sense that even this  tenuous relationship you have built with them is based purely on arcane persuasion and the more  you pry the more you begin to test the boundaries of what you have done pick and choose your words  very carefully  mary zahra sheds a tear which freezes instantly on her face and her internal /none/ flame melts it off  laura thats pretty badass  matt as you continue to walk you can see the center of this village is completely in tatters a lot of  the wood and the dried brush and the furs and thick leathers that these giants had gathered and  constructed their civilization out of is all just shattered and rended to the floor and then  frozen over left in this weird picturesque almost a tapestry a frozen moment in time of  utter desolation actually i want you to all to roll a perception check if you /none/ could  taliesin 17  felicia 14  sam 20  laura oh no were not in 14  mary uno  matt wow getting the ones out so as you guys are walking forward scanlan you notice that  there is just outside the light perception stepping forward a lot of the rubble has been  pushed and coalesced into a central monolith almost like a 25 30 foot sculpture of chaos all  of these things have been matted together with what looks like mud and refuse and as you guys  begin to notice this too you /none/ catch the framing of the light on it and it seems to be built into  almost an altar or a large sculpture of worship of a winged dragon creature that is currently in the  process of swooping down you get the sensation that this was built as essentially a place of  offering to this white dragon and hopefully a symbol to keep themselves alive and to prove their  fealty to this entity  felicia i have a spell called legend lore can i cast that on white dragon  matt lets see what legend lore does /none/  felicia the spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing  you named current tales forgotten stories secret lore that has never been widely known if  it is not of legendary importance you gain no information would i think that this is a  legendary dragon  matt okay as you take a moment and everyone stops to look around you notice that lyra is sitting there  currently muttering to herself and putting her fingers through the air and you can see these  small arcane sigils begin to flash /none/ in the air where she places her hands at which point her eyes  glaze over with this shimmering gold energy and she seems to go into a trance now what you first  are hit with is the image of darkness black and struggle a struggle to push a struggle to exist  a struggle to survive and then suddenly light you see the cracking of something releasing and  from there pulling forth from this singular egg the only one left of its clutch a white dragon  wyrmling pulling itself out of the egg this you immediately /none/ sense is the dragon that now resides  within this mountain  you begin to see flashes in time of it struggling to survive in the frozen tundra to the north  desperately trying to escape poachers and individuals trying to hunt it whether to protect  their own villages or to use its physical body parts in some sort of sale you get the sense that  at one point it was already the target of some contract that failed for a brief second you see  a flash of a frozen cavern recently and a few individuals locked /none/ in an icy prison bitten down on  and shattered before it cuts to black again you begin to see moments of this dragon growing and  with each stage in its physical transformation towards becoming a fullfledged adult dragon there  is just spite there is anger there is ego there is a severe sense of selfimportance a lust for  others to bow before serve or feed it and you have heard and you have read many things about  dragons and you have heard things of great intelligence and articulate entities that even  good or evil /none/ themselves have this extremely intelligent presence this dragon is far more  feral and bestial than anything youve read about it has an intelligence but it seems to not be  concerned with the intricacies of conversation as much as it is to bend everything to its will and  to give voices deepens to me normally and the one thing that catches your mind before the spell  ends is the name that it finally came upon itself the name that it heard whispered as one of its  wouldbe hunters was suddenly  sam jeff  laughter  /none/ matt jeff the dragon the name rimefang rings through your mind  felicia his name is rimefang  matt the two frost giants stop their walking and turn rimefang they nod and look up to the  giant structure they constructed  felicia oh wow can i make a history to sww if i know anyone in the guild who has been named rimefang  matt make a history check on this  felicia its a 21  matt okay rimefang you gather is the name of the dragon proper and theres another drink for  you guys out there /none/ they made fun of me for using the word proper  sam drink  matt this dragon took the name rimefang because in a lot of dragons as they evolve and begin to  really create a lair they really make themselves known publicly and really draw the fear out once  they feel theyre in a comfortable position you feel this dragon is just starting to get to that  point where its eager to drive fear into the local populace from your history check you do  know that there is somewhere in the books youve gone through /none/ a similar contract nothing rimefang  related but there was a white dragon that was supposedly hunted about eight nine months back  and the team never returned and you begin to think wait so if a team of really practiced  people never returned from this contract and we were sent on this as an entry level  felicia hey guys i have a suspicion that maybe the guild didnt want us to succeed and i dont  want to panic anybody i just dont think vanessa  mary lyra do you have any enemies in the guild  /none/ felicia well everyone seems to be very i make a very good soup and i help people with their  laundry sometimes and  laura oh are you like an assistant  felicia no im a guild member i just like to be helpful like you guys  laura i was just wondering  felicia well they just dont send me anywhere its a paperwork thing  mary if you dont mind my asking because i do respect you so much how did your captainship of  our crew come about  felicia well i got a missive i got /none/ a scroll in my room and the first assignment i mean it was  very exciting to me and they havent really paid attention to me mertin is very nice to me but  vanessa she just has her days and ive been asking her for so long and finally i got my  assignment i was hoping aldor would be here but he isnt and thats fine itll be the next one  but there may not be a next one guys thats what im saying  mary oh were you vanessas assistant i mean before you were a /none/ member  felicia no aldor im here with aldor remember  sam if you think weve been sent on some sort of suicide mission  felicia oh thats good the way you put it there  sam well im a master of words should we abandon all hope and just flee is that what  youre suggesting as our leader or should we carry it through and prove everyone wrong  felicia if we abandon this quest then we never i could get kicked out of the guild for one  laura what happens if the contract that we magically /none/ signed doesnt ever come to fruition  felicia its not good let me think  sam you know what retrace your steps  matt there you go in memento fashion all these things flash through if a contract is broken  one if youre a member of the guild youre kicked out of the guild two you guys are on  this essentially as a trial basis to prevent being arrested and put on trial for breaking  the laws of the city of vasselheim and essentially hunting creatures that arent sanctified or you  yourself have not been sanctified to /none/ kill which goes against guild rules and the city itself  which means if you were to not succeed at the contract you would probably be put on trial at the  seat of judgment  laura percy is very good at lawyering  taliesin i am i lawyer quite well but the hope is that we wouldnt actually break the contract in  the first place because thats complicated  mary i wasnt part of this band of breaking the law im here to gain entry into this guild  felicia well you certainly wont get into the guild /none/ if you break the contract  mary no i completely understand but i wont be brought to trial not that im all well its all  about me but im serious thats why im here my motivations are not to save my ass my  motivations are to get into this bloody guild  taliesin were not here based on other peoples expectations were here because we thought we  could handle this and nothing has changed this changes nothing  laura we are very capable fighters  mary ive seen this you have proven yourselves already those orcs didnt /none/ stand a bloody chance  taliesin thank you  felicia so we go  sam we go well actually grog could someone ask ace and gary if were there or if we have  further to travel  felicia well just keep going  matt as grog mentions this you guys have moved past most of the village and youve gone towards  the back of this large chamber and you do see what appears to be a tunnel that ascends upwards  deeper into the mountain proper see did it again its made me all selfconscious but the  /none/ entrance is entirely frozen there is a wall of solid ice between yourselves and the continuation  of this tunnel  laura grog voice how thick is it  matt its hard to see how thick it is from this side  laura grog voice can grog run at it and try to bash it really fast  matt so as you guys step up grog runs ahead of the rest of the giants and goes as hard as he can  towards this laughs so swinging with the axe towards the ice go ahead and  make an attack /dung/ roll  laura its a hammer which i feel would be better against ice  matt this giant flaming warhammer from king murghol  laura i feel like every dice is betraying me  taliesin would you like to use mine  laura no im going to curse yours  matt no turn it around shake the wil wheaton curse  laura ill just leave it at that it slipped out of my hands but im going to keep it 15 plus  what eight plus nine  matt plus nine thatll definitely hit go ahead and roll damage for /none/ that  laura okay here we go  sam i hope he can hit a wall  laura i dont know with my ones as of late oh thats just ten  matt ten damage including the fire damage  laura oh yes right 13  matt 13 damage whack the warhammer streaks through the light causing this interesting  shifting of the radius around it as it smacks into the ice with this resounding thwack sound  the ice shakes and shimmers a giant crack forms up the front of it and you can see as he grunts  /none/ pulls it out the wall itself seems to have largely crumbled in the small space there and  looks very fragile but its definitely left an impact on the wall  taliesin i can make an attempt at this im going to walk over and study the shattering position and  see if i can find the weak point in the wall  matt okay go ahead and make an investigation check  taliesin seven getting it all out of my system now  matt the ice wall itself is not a specific architectural structure it is made of some /none/ sort  of blasting of ice that froze the air in that way so it doesnt have any real geometric positioning  but the ice structure itself youre unable to make out what would be a weak point or not other  than the place of impact where grog placed the hammer  taliesin im going to take a musket ball go over to the very center of the crack  laura should we keep a little more quiet than that  felicia can i use a fire bolt that would be good a fire bolt  taliesin lets save /none/ the fire bolt  felicia no its a cantrip is that okay  taliesin im backing up  felicia im the leader im going to say im going to  taliesin she said fire bolt i backed away  felicia and that is 1d8 fire damage which is seven seven fire damage  matt all right go ahead and roll to see if you hit with it so roll and add your spell attack  modifier  felicia what is that oh its 12 plus 11 so that is 23  matt all right that definitely hits how much damage /none/ that was seven fire damage you said  felicia oh its 3d10 fire sorry because of my level which is seven and five and seven is 19  matt clutching your staff at one side the books under your shoulder you bring your hand out and  withdraw your hand with the force of the blast of the fire bolt going forward as it smacks into the  section where grog had slammed the hammer boof it bursts as a flash of arcane reddish fiery  energy and the wall itself shatters inward and starts falling and crumbling nearby now /none/ this  tall wall which was about 25 feet tall begins to fall in giant chunks  felicia yelps sorry  matt im going to go ahead and have lyra and percy and grog all make dexterity saving throws  felicia oh im so good at that with the negatives oh  laura 19  taliesin i cant use acrobatics  matt no not for this  laura 21 for grog  felicia i rolled a zero because ive got a negative two its not even on the dice  matt percy  taliesin nine  matt all right so /none/  felicia is that worse than a critical fail  matt as the whole wall just shattering noise breaking and falling down around you you all go  rushing backward grog strangely and unexpectedly shoulderrolls out of the way epic  geordi la forge style escapes the crumbling wall unfortunately though lyra and percy stumble  backward slipping on the ice thats actually coated the floor of this cavern and get impacted  with part of the fall its not too bad but both of you suffer 14 points of cold damage and  bludgeoning cold and bludgeoning as the /none/ wall comes tumbling down on you however the rest of  the cavern now lies open with pieces of jagged ice almost like a broken glass window itself framing  the exterior of this tunnel  felicia im not going to go to the front anymore guys  sam well youre the leader shouldnt you be  laura we should protect her she should be towards the back  taliesin im going to heal really quickly  matt take another short rest  laura we should take a short rest so that were going in you know  felicia yeah /none/ i had scoliosis as a child im not nimble its funny  mary before we take a short rest may i again use awakened mind just to see  how far away we are  matt you get an image of a slowly ascending and spiraling tunnel that ascends towards an upper  cavern at the top of the mountain the upper cavern you only get a few glimpses of as they  themselves have only had a few glimpses of it but it appears this is not the only  obstacle in the way  mary oh good  /none/ sam lets carry on then  laura could you see when you were looking into their mind if it is open or if it is just a big  cavern  mary i could not see  matt from the best vantage point you could see it was a chamber about id say 80 to 85 feet to  the ceiling lined with jagged ice crystals that  are coalesced in a temperature so cold that its  almost like the inside of a geode but its all made of ice but you see multiple platforms that  are risen /none/ in the walls of this and in the center there is a singular platform and there sitting on  the top of it is apparently the dragon quarry you seek and then the image shuts itself out as one  of them glances over the shoulder its growing uncomfortable with sharing information  mary got it i thank him in my mind  matt all right pressing forward you can see one giant still dragging itself forward with a portion  of its physical body essentially gutted  mary what if we gave him a half healing potion  sam /none/ dont mess with the magic  laura because heres the thing if they fight with us its great but if they turn on us then  we are going to have to fight them at full power again  mary yeah but we have 24 hours  sam yes but the healing potion might do something lets just keep going you are a very  kind soul  matt so are you guys taking a short rest to heal up okay if you havent already rolled your  dice you healed up now perfect all right so as you guys /none/ continue to trudge up this extremely  cold let me see i think itll be a fun one to there we go you guys continue to ascend up  this pitchblack cavern here it appears that both the giants and the dragon do not need light to  make their way through this cavern structure so you are the small beads of visual lightness in the  entire structure the floor itself is slick and there are bits of rough rock that you can find  foot purchase but there are a few moments where  some of you slip /none/ and you lose about ten feet and  then catch yourself and have to move upward with this slight 35degree incline slowly spiraling  upward you push forward for about 30 minutes or so in this long seemingly for lack of a better  term there isnt a lot of changed variation to it its just a gradual spiral in itself  laura i want to keep perception out to make sure that nothing is ahead of us  matt go ahead and roll a perception check  laura okay but this is pertaining to dragons he is one of /none/ my favored enemies so i have  additional bonuses to tracking him and insight against him favored enemies  matt all right so youre perceiving anything dragonrelated and things that would be a  forewarning of a dragon okay  laura things he would have laid down for us stuff like that  matt okay go ahead and roll again you have an advantage  laura you know just to see okay 18  matt okay glancing about you do see there are claw marks along the walls you can see where  portions of this cavern were carved out /none/ by the claws of rimefang you can see that occasionally  there are pieces of frozen rock that are solid ice some that appear to be an unthawed chunk of  flesh of some kind as you push further up this cavern you spot what looks like the lower half of  a statue  felicia ugh thats a oh my god  taliesin thats unpleasant  laura half of a giant right  matt this appears to be a frost giant that met its end the actual lower half of the torso itself  is giving off a stench /none/ of slowly rotting flesh there is ice encasing the lower half of it its  interesting because the physical form of the frost giants resist cold naturally and this temperature  would normally freeze any other flesh completely solid here it naturally decays but there is a  distinct place where the torso was removed forcibly by what looks like a series of daggers  andor dragons teeth  felicia i have little ginger chews if anybody wants one  taliesin ill take one  felicia here you go thank you just in my little pack here  matt about /none/ ten more minutes of walking you come upon another frozen wall barrier  sam i will check it for traps  matt go ahead and roll perception  laura laughs thanks brother  sam five  matt as far as you can tell it is a frostsnowcovered ground with walls and a  ceiling  sam everyone there are definitely no traps here  laura oh good maybe we should stay back  felicia maybe i could do the fire bolt from afar thats a good idea and a leader idea that i had  that you just reminded me /none/ of  laura good thinking lyra  felicia thank you oh that definitely hits thats 28  matt 28 go ahead and roll damage  felicia its a nine and a ten and five 24  matt 24 so as you focus close one eye and aim you release a secondary fire bolt boosh it  slams into the front of the wall of ice which immediately bursts inside shattered shards of  glasslike ice go flying further up the cavern the rest of it falls and collapses at a distance  crashing around you thankfully youre all far enough /none/ away where there isnt an issue and the  wall seems to have shattered  felicia thats the way you do it thank you oh my gosh you guys  laura before we move forward ive studied dragons a lot i just want to say so obviously we  all know theyre susceptible to fire damage yes this is an icebreathing bastard do as much fire  attacks as we can  mary yes dont dragons love especially white ones shiny sparkly things especially gems from  what ive gleaned over the years  laura if he could be distracted /none/ during combat maybe  felicia a very aggressive person i got a glimpse of his attitude and it is not pleasant  laura not happy  felicia no he is full of bile and vitriol and he likes to be worshiped we could pretend to be  worshiping him  laura but hell still want to eat us but yes we could do that  felicia i mean he didnt eat these two guys  laura it might be something to think about  felicia at least to get close to him  laura before we spring an attack yes /none/  matt go ahead and make an intelligence check  laura with advantage because its pertaining to dragons  sam laughs shes a stickler  laura is that an insight check  matt thats just adding your intelligence modifier  laura okay let me see what that oh thats grogs what am i doing okay so 20 was the first  roll 20 is the high roll oh wait no 22  matt 22 okay a few things you do know about dragons specifically a white dragon from your  studying you lost someone very important to you supposedly to /none/ a dragon and so youve spent a lot  of your life focused on their techniques their abilities how they work white dragons you know  have complete immunity to cold cold damage of all sorts has no effect on them whatsoever you know  that they have capability of flight they surround themselves with ice but are not hindered by it  whatsoever you do know that their claws and teeth are extremely dangerous they themselves also  using their wings and tail become a fierce entity from all sides its cold breath is extremely  dangerous it can /none/ affect a large area and even its presence is frightful enough to where some of  the most seasoned adventurers go running fleeing or cowering in a corner let alone encountering  one in its lair itself it already has an advantage as it sets an environment to put it at  its advantage so anything and everything you can do to prepare and be ready for such an encounter  would be highly recommended you do get the sensation that even though they are coldbased  fire doesnt necessarily do any additional damage but it is not reduced or /none/ able to resist it  laura it cant resist fire what about lightning damage do i know anything about that  matt best that you know most magics and other types of damage other than cold have an effect on  it though it does have unnatural resilience to spells and things for a large part of the combat  felicia i can cast stoneskin on one person or up to actually i could cast stoneskin  up to three times  matt but its a concentration spell so you can only have it up on one person  felicia /none/ i can only have it on one person at a time so who would be most likely to resist  slashing and bludgeoning and piercing  laura probably grog hes going to be the one thats going to be up close out of all of us  matt as grog says thats all right if im raging i already have the ability to resist  laura thats true he takes half to piercing and slashing  felicia oh okay so then we need the other person who might be within range  taliesin laura and mary trinket  sam trinkets /none/ here  laughter  matt as you look over sad bear moan  laura trinkets right there scanlan  felicia i dont want to demean him but his performance is  laura lyra  felicia i love him of course he gets the spell  laura he is really really cool  sam he does things  felicia yes of course i dont know what i was thinking  laura heres the thing if he doesnt have stoneskin i probably wont let him charge  taliesin but if he does have stoneskin will you let him charge  laura probably /none/  felicia all right well that could be another does that seem like a good idea for a bear  mary scanlan are most of your attacks up close or are they far  sam ive got a wide range i like to keep people guessing its my thing  felicia but we wouldnt really want you within claw damage  sam i wouldnt want that either  felicia it does make more i dont mean to demean trinket he is a lovely bear  sam of all the bears ive known hes top five top five  matt as /none/ youre saying this trinket senses the conversation and plants both feet in the ground  growls  laura see how tough he is  matt he seems to be showing off and for a moment even though its a conversation thats a  dangerouslooking bear  mary i use beast speak on trinket and say trinket what are you feeling right now whats  going on you seem very excited  matt okay you notice zahra leans forward and starts giving this series of low guttural sounds  its weird theres this weird arcane interference and this strange almost like /none/ the sound itself is  being muffled and stretched and trinket turns to her and starts giving the same noises back  trinket says to you essentially ill do whatever it takes to protect my vex if this  creature tries anything i will tear its throat from its head  felicia hes a sexier bear than i thought he was  laura and he gives good massages lyra  felicia okay so i will cast stoneskin it lasts an hour so ill cast it within the perimeter that  we think were going to get hit  laura tell /none/ him that i love him very much  mary i also want to tell you trinket first of all boy or girl just have to check  laura hes a boy look at his giant dick  matt he leans back in a sitting bear position  mary thank you i needed some inspiration for this fight were about to do all right i also  want you to know that vex loves you very much and will do whatever she can to protect you  matt as this guttural conversation comes forth trinket comes up to you and nuzzles /none/ his nose up  against your side  laura oh little buddy  felicia i wish aldor would do that to me  sam and mary show his giant cock to you  laughter  felicia i saw it once it was glorious  mary very inspiring  matt as lyras in this memory trance finishes casting stoneskin and reaches out and touches  trinket you can see trinkets physical form all the fur seems to coalesce into a thick rocktype  exterior shell of magical protection  laura what does his armor class raise by  matt armor class /none/ doesnt change but all damage that trinket takes from bludgeoning piercing or  slashing is reduced by half  laura nice  mary thank you trinket lovely to talk to you  sam what else can we do to prepare  laura i promise lyra i will let him attack this battle  felicia oh good no its fantastic that invited so many good thoughts in my mind i dont mind  anything at this point i mean what  matt the giants begin to move forward into the cavern  laura its happening  mary yep screw your courage /none/ to the stickingplace  taliesin ew oh all right  matt all right scanlan i want you to go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw  sam oh boy already dex 17 oh plus four 21  matt 21 as you begin stepping forward up the cavern where the wall itself has collapsed you  step forward onto a part of the ice that is far more brittle than you expected and suddenly it  cracks breaks beneath your foot  sam my scanlansense is tingling  matt you push off and fall onto your back and as you /none/ guys look over you hear the cracking and the  falling of some sort of stone or icelike structure you see where scanlan was stepping a  tenfootdiameter pit crumbles and falls beneath and peering over the inside and using your light  you can see there appears to be an arrangement of razorsharp ice spikes gathered at the bottom of a  15foot pit  laura what why isnt my brother here i need to check for traps from now on snoop ahead  taliesin i think weve found one theres a trap right there  sam does that /none/ take up our whole path now  matt the tunnel itself is about 20 feet wide at this point so you guys can move around it the  giants were ahead of you at this point  sam did they laugh  matt one of them shakes his head and the other one just keeps walking  felicia gee i had a spell that would be useful but its not ready  sam thanks for that update  felicia im just being honest i couldve lied said that i totally prepared that spell but i  couldve been knowing giant /none/ the whole time so i just  laura laughs oops  felicia if anybody falls i can make them fall gently thats on the list  laura oh thats good is that feather fall nice okay i perceive some more and see if i see  any traps ahead of us the whole time  matt all right you go ahead and make a perception check as you move forward  laura that would be a seven 15  matt 15 okay you guys continue to push upwards this long spiraling corridor you reach another  ice wall that has /none/ already been partially broken from some sort of encounter long ago you  immediately see that the part of the wall that is broken theres about a tenfootwide blocked  passage the entirety of that walkway appears to be another trap and the giants are waiting back  laura good for you theres a thing here we should not step on it  i have one job on this ship  mary i know its stupid but goddamn it im going to do it  sam how do we get around what do we do  laura we should maybe /none/ break down this ice wall and then not walk on this area how about that  sam oh okay lets yes  felicia oh good should i firebolt i mean im going to firebolt from a distance  laura felicia mary and sam singing from a distance the world is  sam beaches  felicia thats a 30  matt 30 go ahead and roll some damage  felicia yeah nine and eight and a ten these are good rolls thats a 27  matt 27 this bolt arcs around from the side you hit it right at the point /none/ where half of the wall  had collapsed causing the other half of the wall to immediately shatter and collapse inward  spraying bits of ice and rock against the wall on that side the ground becomes rough terrain in  that general vicinity but its easy enough to traverse over without any serious issue as you  guys step over and the giants make their way across stepping over it entirely with their long  gait you move carefully over the shattered wall bits but the ground itself seems solid you get  past without issue  laura before /none/ we go into the actual lair of the dragon once we get to it i dont know much more  of these thingies there are do we want to go in as if were offering it something and saying hey  we love you we want to bring you people and stuff like that  mary we are here to serve you  laura or do we want to send somebody in first and act like theyre here to serve it and then we all  spring in and surprise it what do you want to do  sam they /none/ like to eat giants  laura it wants to eat anything frozen basically it freezes things and then it eats them  felicia well there was another party that the guild the guild did send another party  laura i dont know if they had a method or if they just walked right in  taliesin perhaps if were quiet and stealthy can we be quiet and stealthy  felicia i cant  mary i can cast invisibility  felicia ooh i can cast invisibility on myself  sam that would help  mary so learning of the dragon will /none/ it be able to detect us if we cast invisibility  felicia thats nature that would be a nature check or animal handling  matt this would be an intelligence check  felicia oh well i can do that thats a 30 thats a 23  matt okay so what youve read of dragons their ability to sense their surroundings is adapted to  all environments whether they can see or not they actually have the ability to see with no  sight necessary to a certain extent so invisibility would help at a distance quite a bit  of /none/ distance but within a certain point it is able to sense your presence whether or not it can see  you also note if you cast invisibility you lose your concentration spell on trinket  felicia oh so lets not do that now his vanity he does like being worshipped  so that is the key  sam so we could go in with an offering  laura an offering what if we laid a trap in the offering what if we used your frag grenade that  you did is it a bomb does it set off on a /none/ timer is it very fragile  taliesin i have to set it off personally i actually have to shoot it to set it off  mary so smile you son of a bitch basically if we put it in his mouth  laura do we have any bombs or anything like that because i have a very big beautiful diamond of  awesomeness that we uncovered before that i keep about we could present him with this big  hugeass diamond and then have it trapped with some sort of exploding device  sam we could  felicia if he /none/ picks the diamond up off of the  laura we could put it in a bag and then put the diamond on top of a bomb or something and then  when he picks it up and like explosion in his face  taliesin thats hoping for an awful lot of things to go our way more things than normally go our  way to be fair  felicia well it seems worthy of trying to get close to him because his attacks would he as a  dragon have a very good length attack  matt yeah as a /none/ dragon has some decent reach with some of its attacks its bite and its length of  neck and ability to bite actually has quite a bit of reach also its tail has quite some reach as  well it can cover some decent ground just with its physical form  felicia the thing is obviously the trolls dont come up here a lot or there wouldnt be so much  ice in here walls so i think thats a problem so its not as if they come up here all the time  to give it treats right  /none/ sam we could just walk in there i could be holding lyra as my captive and say ive brought  you this captive to eat  felicia i dont like that one  sam well you know youre very appealing  mary we still dont know that the giants arent going to help us  matt as you guys are stepping forward up the pathway you turn a corner and you can see the  giants have stopped and they have a physical trepidation to the way that theyre leaning  backward in their stance as you turn the corner /none/ the little bit of light that reaches out you can  see there appears to be one final ice wall that has a tenfoot opening where its left as a  pathway and it opens into a darkened chamber  mary well i have darkvision for 60 feet so i could approach around the side and peer in and just  see whats there 60 feet ahead  matt okay so you walk up past the giants to this entrance all right as you walk forward you see  your vision spill out in the darkness with a little bit /none/ of dim light and the darkness before  you reveals itself you can see a smattering of broken bits along the ground looks like rocks and  ice a frozen leg of some humanoid an arm some scattered broken armor and weapons there are  pieces of what appears to be a frozenover graveyard of previous attempts towards inhabiting  this room and as you continue to push forward towards the edge just towards the perimeter as  far as your vision can see at this doorway you see a central platform in the middle of this giant  chamber /none/ that rises up about 15 feet ten 15 feet and just cresting over the top of this platform is  the edge of an alabaster snout with teeth overlapping you hear this snarls growling  snarl and this little voice spills out from underneath and says why dont you enter if  youre going to arrive and present yourselves do not cower yet  felicia get that diamond out  matt and with that were going to go ahead and take a break  shouting  matt were going to take a quick tenminute break to go ahead and use /none/ the bathroom get a little

your way through the cavern back here zahra has stepped  forward and in the darkness you can see right here at the edge a form  felicia /none/ hes up above us though  matt yep about ten 15 feet up on this platform leaning over the edge is rimefang staring at you  through the darkness a claw comes forward and beckons  laura can i from here before we go in there im going to cast hunters mark on him  matt you cant see him right now  mary i can  matt zahra can  travis i can too ive got my belt of dwarven darkvision  felicia is he speaking dragon  matt speaking common  felicia hes speaking common

a diamond oh its a really  pretty diamond  taliesin well get it back its okay  laura as long as it doesnt explode /none/  taliesin you cant explode a diamond  laura thats true diamonds are really

guys all walk in  sam im going ahead  laura here hold the bag  sam ill take the bag  matt zahra are you staying ahead with scanlan  felicia i believe that you squishy people should be back /none/ here  travis im not squishy i go with them  matt as a note as you guys are walking through and the light hits the walls you begin to see the  ice itself which youve become accustomed to is now being broken up into what looks like little  glittering stars its almost like youre walking through a frozen area of the night sky you  realize that there are gold pieces frozen in sporadically all throughout the wall the floor  the ceiling here the actual whatever wealth this dragon has acquired is in some way shape /none/ or form  embedded in its own lair anyway so we have the three of you up front whos up next i imagine  weve got trinket  laura yeah me  matt all right so you guys all continue to move forward  mary not too close  laura scanlan  matt there where do you want to stop you guys have laser pointers to use by the way if you  want to point out wherever you want to be  laura scanlan should definitely talk to him  taliesin i would like to go around here  /none/ felicia oh glorious rimefang we have an offering for you  taliesin thats not me  sam is that you hello  matt no that was you sorry so percy goes here  laura over by percy but further  felicia is that 90 feet  sam its less than that were 30 feet away now  laura oh come on giants help us out  matt so as you guys enter the chamber the actual air here is more still and cold than at any point  of the interior of the cavern has been even breathing inward hurts /none/ in itself as the freezing  air hits your lungs rimefang sits there perched on top of this central platform grinning down  towards the rest of the group you who have shouted this out lyra about having an offering  rimefang immediately leans forward an offering you say  laura i want to make my way further up while hes talking i want to make my way along the wall  a little  matt make a stealth check  laura oh no 20 natural 20 and all i needed was fried chicken  laughter  travis its true /none/  matt all right so you somehow manage to dart out of the visual reference of a very focused  adult white dragon rimefang does not seem to gather any movement and you vanish into the side  where do you want to go  laura a little bit further there that sounds good  matt okay percy as youre stepping over you realize youre stepping onto what looks like the  broken lower half of another giant that has fallen over a booted leg and part of an eaten armored  torso to your back as you begin to /none/ look through you also see there currently frozen in place three  other individuals that are in midbattle and are frozen solid  laura if we unfreeze them they could help us  felicia theyre probably dead in there  travis were standing in front of a dragon  sam rimefang  mary oh great rimefang what a glorious moon you are amidst the stars of your treasure  travis oh pour it on why dont you  laughter  mary we do have an offering for you  sam yes and i use mage hand to lift the diamond /none/ out of the bag and dangle it in front of the  dragon weve brought you this diamond weve come from the slayers take we represent the guild and  we are here to formally apologize for sending a few of our members here in the past and promise  that we never shall again and as a gift of apology and hopefully brotherhood we offer you  this diamond there are many more to come  taliesin and everything else in the bag as well  laura and then you put it back in the bag and then you /none/ give it to him  matt theres this low guttural snarl snarls it leans forward sneaking down off the perch a  little bit its head moves forward and stretches outward no more than maybe ten feet from your  face you can see it inspecting the diamond as youre holding it by the mage hand floating above  the rest of the bag chuckles to itself chuckles this is your measly offering  sam there is a diamond of much greater size and value in this pouch but first we want to hear  that you are going to /none/ allow us safe passage out of here before we turn it over to you  matt persuasion check  zac guys just so you know the streams buffering so hold twitch problems  felicia oh no  zac hold for buffer  matt do we know at what point it started buffering  zac youre back up missing the last two sentences buffer over  sam please allow us safe passage and then you said roll for persuasion and i rolled a 19  matt rimefangs head withdraws back and its claws pull back on top of the platform it /none/ lifts its  head up looking down at you with this very disinterested snooty look huffs as it snorts  out of its nose this puff of frost shoots out and crystals of ice fall and clatter to the ground  around it  sam that was so cool  matt you you trespass into my domain your voices bickering and bouncing off the walls  annoying me waking me from my slumber my freshly eaten slumber i am curious before you so walk  into my dinner table why you seem to have gotten past my guardians at which /none/ point the two giants  who are standing behind you look over at each other nervously  sam your guardians are well aware of our power and position and did not want to offend you by  turning us away  matt are you to tell me i spared your insignificant lives so you could let this  insulting insufferable insect into the heart of my domain  sam im called burt reynolds and i take great offense at that  matt the dragons head turns to the side for a moment as a glance of confusion and almost  /none/ amusement that you speak up to it with such a disrespectful manner evil laughter  sam you can call me mr reynolds or simply burt  matt heavy impacts its claws dig in and tighten on the edges of this platform you can see the  stonework and the ice crack and shatter under its grip as pieces of stone tumble down the edges of  the platform scattering across the ground with a slight clattering the wings whoosh unfurl  outward its head looks down upon you directly  burt  laughter  matt you say youre from the /none/ slayers take i have not lived these hundred years or so to become  the hunted i am the hunter i am the scourge of the thorain tundra i am the stalker of this  timberland well parts of you shall adorn my walls glittering in pieces for times to come  giants to my side tonight you choose whether i dine on you or just them  mary i use fuck me  laughter  taliesin i dont know if you have that spell  felicia really whats the dc on that  mary its very high i use /none/ awakened mind to once more say now we have seen what you have been  through we see the terror that you face every day from this awful beast this is your chance you  may not have another fight him with us and destroy this beast forever  matt make a persuasion check versus the dragons intimidation check  sam oh versus a dragon  laura natural 20 all the way natural 20 ive had my bow notched and i cast hunters mark while  all this is going on  mary 18 18 plus what  sam what /none/ is it persuasion  matt persuasion  mary plus nine 27  matt the giants look at each other and they look down at the rest of you they pull their axes out  shields at the ready and look back up at rimefang and in giant you hear muttered under  their breath its now or never  cheering  matt roll initiative  mary yes  laura felicia and taliesin oh my god  felicia oh i rolled lower  laura i rolled a 20  taliesin i rolled another 20  laura me too  travis what /none/ is it with you and your 20s  taliesin i dont know i dont know what happened  matt okay all right 25 to 20 anyone  laura 25  taliesin 28  mary what  matt all right we have percy we have vex leaving that up there all right  we have 20 to 15  travis 19  matt 19 nice 15 to ten  mary 12  matt 12 zahra 12 ten to five  sam seven  matt seven for scanlan laughing what did you roll  felicia negative one  laughter  mary thats /none/ our leader  matt did you roll a natural one  felicia i rolled a one and i have a negative two  travis on your initiative  felicia yes im never going im going to just have a snack  travis you break out the trail mix  taliesin the little gingers come back out  felicia is that a record  travis that is a record i dont think weve ever had a negative initiative  matt all right so as the wings unfurl on top of this platform the combat round  begins with percy  taliesin /none/ if i take one shot can i hold my second shot until an event can i time my second shot  matt no youd have to hold your initiative or you do all your actions in one round  unfortunately  taliesin darn it what initiative did you roll again  sam low second to last  taliesin in that case im going to take a few steps behind that frozen creature right there im  going to pull out bad news  mary sam and taliesin singing bad news  taliesin im going to aim for the face im /none/ going to take a head shot on him  matt okay the frozen warrior is in front of you  taliesin im just using him as partial cover  matt okay so youre behind the creature are you just putting it on it to aim  taliesin more or less im using him as a steady and as partial cover as i take a head shot on the  dragon im not taking a bonus for damage no oh 15  matt 15 unfortunately does not hit as you shoot gunshot it actually hits the body but the  hardness /none/ of the dragons scales ricochets the shot off ricochet sound you see it impact on some  part of the far side of the cavern  taliesin im going to burn a bonus action and spend another grit point and do another shot  matt so youre doing your action surge  taliesin im taking my action surge  matt okay so you use your action surge and thats it for this round you use your first round  to reload bad news and place it back up on top  taliesin come on  matt another head shot you /none/ said  taliesin yeah oh 19 thats much better plus 12 thats 32 to hit and thats 15 points of  damage and head shot means hes got disadvantage on all attacks for the next round  matt okay good to know so im going to go ahead and roll all right so gunshot from the impact  of the blast you see the shot ricochet off of rimefangs face the impact sends a couple pieces  of white dragon scale shooting off into the darkness and the head grunts rears from the  impact shakes seemingly loosely shaken by /none/ the impact of the blast the blowback from the gun  actually sends a large crack through the physical body of the ice warrior ahead of you and it  collapses into a pile of ice on the ground in front of you  taliesin i feel a little guilty about that i feel very guilty about that  matt you get the feeling that whatever was there probably has not been alive  for quite a while  taliesin okay i feel a little better  matt frozen solid it breaks like the t1000  taliesin and he was /none/ the most useful hes ever been  matt that ends percys turn were up at vex  laura okay im going to cast lightning arrow and im going to attack through my blazing bow  matt all righty  laura okay oh thats good that is a 25  matt 25 25 does hit yes  laura okay so that is 4d8 of lightning damage  matt all right saving throw for half or just take it  laura saving throw for half yes  matt thats a natural 20 on its saving throw so it takes half damage  /none/ felicia thats some stinkeye  matt hey better on a saving throw than on an attack  laura 13 plus six is 19 20 so ten plus regular damage right for my regular 19 i know 11 plus  ten is 21 plus hunters mark is four and then plus my blazing bow which adds another ten where  did that land shit balls im so aggressive right now im going to roll a different one oh  my god that looks like a one oh wow two ones thats great  matt so as you pull back your arrow /none/ the actual shaft begins to spark with bluish energy as you  release it the arrow transforms energy noises into an arcing bolt of electrical energy it  impacts and courses through the upper torso of the dragon as its grunts still trying to shake off  the damage it took from percys attack it manages to push off most of the impact but still takes  damage from it theres also a burst of fire from the impact as well you can see a bit of flame  trickle up the side of his body and it eventually goes /none/ out from the cold in the air  laura that was one attack  matt yes  laura okay  matt but was the spell an action  laura the lightning arrow is a bonus  matt oh okay so it makes your next attack do that right gotcha so you have one more attack  laura so i am going to send trinket where is he  matt trinkets over here with the giants guarding him  laura dear lord can trinket run around and attack his butt  matt its actually up on top of a 15foot platform /none/  laura oh so trinket cant do shit right now  matt not right now but trinket can move if you like  laura trinkets going to move and im going to attack again can i do that  matt yeah you can do that  laura we want to spread out  matt thats as far as trinket get can get there  laura can i attack again  matt you can yeah  laura all right ill hit him again okay just a regular attack through the bow  matt yep this is your second use of it /none/ though youre done with it  laura yes 17  matt 17 as you fire the arrow it takes its wing and whoosh batters it out of the way and the arrow  shatters in mid air you see a burst of fire as it does nothing  laura it was a 25 that hit before what was the first attack that hit  taliesin i was in the 30s  matt so that ends your turn vex do you want to move or do you want to stay right there  laura can i stealth  matt laughs no /none/ thats a hide action i think  laura then im going to move along the wall further yeah like that  matt that ends your turn rimefang now shaking off the frustration looks around the room lifts  up on its back hind legs spreads its wings and just gives this large roar roars the entire  room shakes and you see pieces of ice and rock begin to start falling from the ceiling  everybody go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw everybody one giant is fine all right  starting with percy  taliesin 12  matt /none/ 12  felicia 15  sam natural 20 but it becomes 18  matt okay  felicia because youre not wise  mary 21  matt all right  laura ten  matt grog  travis nine  matt thats rough  travis very wise  sam oh lots of red circles  matt all right so the sheer amount of presence that this dragon permeates sends a shiver of fear  down your spine vex percy grog and one of the giants are currently frightened of the dragon  while you are frightened you have disadvantage on ability checks /none/ and attack rolls and you cannot  willingly move closer to the dragon  laura is trinket frightened  matt roll for trinket  laura okay come on trinket no hes probably pretty frightened oh does that count as  intimidation  matt no its a wisdom saving throw so its whatever his wisdom bonus is  laura he rolled an eight so im guessing hes pretty scared  matt probably scared trinket all of a sudden also scared bear noises backs up a little bit  and is looking equally frightened especially seeing you scared trinket feels a moment /none/ of fear  there  laura youve still got a really big dick  felicia what  laura im just telling him to encourage him  travis i missed something  sam not the dragon although probably the dragon too  matt rimefang then whoosh flies up into the air for a minute and then swoops over and lands over  on this side and thats going to end its turn that brings us to grog  travis i got to break it right  matt yeah youre scared  travis rage i look over my shoulder terrified at the /none/ other one thats scared and i say repeat  after me lads i would like to rage  matt you reach into your inner self and suddenly you realize this is it you know dragons youve  fought dragons in the past youve killed dragons in the past and you know dragons have been  responsible for hurting some of your friends and their families and through that that anger just  billows up from inside and that fear shakes from your body  travis i want to kill a dragon like my friend pike did  matt youre now /none/ in a rage you shake the fear effect and you can take the rest of your turn as  you see fit  travis battle cry i would like to run over that direction  sam oh youre running away from it  matt you rageran  travis i rageran can i attack  matt youre currently hiding behind a 15foot platform  travis so i cant see beyond it  matt youre literally hiding from the dragon right now cool all right that ends your turn  zahra youre up  mary all right how far away is it /none/ from me  matt it is currently 30 feet from you  mary all right  matt real fast grog make a dexterity saving throw  travis 13  matt 13  laura what was that for  matt as youre running through all of a sudden the floor gives out from underneath you and you  roll off to the side you almost fall in catching yourself you slide down into a pit but manage to  get your handhold on a piece of stone thats jutting out of the rock pull yourself up  underneath where you were /none/ in the ground is a cracked piece of ice a pit in the ground  laura seriously  matt but youre fine you get back up to your feet that couldve been really bad its about 15  feet down into these jagged shards of ice  laura my passive perception is 21 just for future reference  matt good to know you also have no light source youre at the far back in the darkness actually  you have grog around you right now  mary and i still have light cast  matt yeah so youre fine all /dung/ right that brings us to zahra once again  mary i cast my bonus hex on this beautiful beast  matt it is now hexed as well  sam whats that do whats that  mary i get extra damage  travis you sexy tailed bastard  mary i take my dark dragon staff and as this moon orb begins to glow i cast witch bolt is  that it yes witch bolt upon it infused with my own internal moon fire  matt all right do you have to roll to hit on that one  mary witch bolt /none/ yeah what do i do its plus 11 5d12 plus two  laura yeah so roll and then add 11  mary 13  laura oh thats good  mary 24 plus two damage to all spells cast so 26  laura no thats damage  mary oh sorry 24  matt all right so witch bolt does hit go ahead and roll damage for that  mary so 5d12 five times all right do math for me somebody what is that thats a three  travis three plus the two so thats five  laura you do it all /none/ and then add the two  travis oh gotcha seven  mary thats four  travis yeah plus four 19 26 38  mary one more  laura no thats all five  matt five and you add 1d6 to that because of your hex  laura plus two so 38 is 40  mary one  matt okay so 41 points  mary yeah  laura plus anything else wait plus two damage to all oh but thats already  travis thats already there  matt okay so after you hex it you can see the shadows around the /none/ dragon begin to form and  coalesce around its torso and as it looks around these small demonic faces that cackle as bits of  moonlight begin to pierce through these grins chokehold around its neck and as it tries to  shake it off you bring your staff forward and this bolt of bluishgreen electrical energy shakes  out in what looks like a piercing arc of jagged moonlight that strikes right into the center of  the dragons chest as it does the dragons nearly pushed off its feet for a second gathers  itself and you can /none/ see that energy surrounds it like magical shackles it continues to keep its  hold on the creature as witch bolt does all right do you wish to move or are you going to  stay where you are you can move 30 feet six squares  mary id like to go stand by the giants  travis youre already there  matt yeah youre right here its hard for you to see because that guys in the way but youre  right there  mary all right no the other way blinding players as we go where am i /dung/ im there id like  to move to the slight cover of the pedestal  matt you can get that far all right so there you are that ends your turn zahra scanlan  youre up  sam my eyes begin to change to a dark shade as i turn my gaze to the dragon  and cast eyebite on him  travis what cast what  sam eyebite  matt all right and how are you having that affect him  sam i would like to sicken him give him a little tummyache  travis is he going to /none/ do the twirls  matt okay were going to do eyebite here  sam through my hand cone of clarity  matt all right so wisdom saving throw for the dragon use my meteor dice one of the fans out  there sent all right whats the dc on that now total  sam its 19  matt 19 that would fail its going to use its legendary resistance to  choose to succeed instead  sam it can just choose to succeed  travis how many times can it choose to do that  matt three times per day /none/ welcome to fighting a dragon  sam what but that was a cool spell  matt so as your eyes darken the dragons currently surrounded by the witch bolt and the hex  on the creature you darken your eyes and you look over and see the arcane energy taking your  vision its vision combine it in midair as you do it shakes its head and roars shouts you  instinctively pull back and as you do the spell drifts away from you and you realize the  incantations lost  travis percy use your badass motherfucker feat to /none/ have it work  sam okay can i throw with a bonus action  matt what are you going to throw  sam a bag  matt no thats probably more of an action but you can drop it as a bonus action  sam got it then i will move a few steps away i can still move and stuff right i would like to  move away from this group of soontobeblastedwithdragonfire people just a  few yards away to my left  matt all right  sam thats fine sure thats great and give some inspiration to /none/ lyra ill say singing when  the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie thats aldore  cheering  travis yeah going deep  matt and suddenly the fear thats getting close to clutching your heart and giving you every  instinct to run from this you hear the name aldor and you feel that surge of warmth fill your  body and the need to push on forward go ahead and take a d10 inspiration dice to use in any roll  you want  felicia oh my gosh thank you so much thats beautiful  sam /none/ well i wrote it for you  matt all right that ends your turn scanlan now the giants go this one is going to move to the  side its deathly afraid of the dragon its like this is a bad idea its really regretting  its decision its going to attempt to shake the effect and does so  cheering  matt shakes its fright the other one is going to step over you as youre like all of a sudden  this foot goes wham in front of you youre like nervous sound  felicia oh my god /none/ i got hit with his dick  laughter  travis what were their names ace and base  sam and mary ace and gary  matt the giants going to move forward its going to attempt to make two strikes with its  greataxe thats going to be a 17 that misses and a 16 that misses whooshing makes two  strikes to the dragon and it just dodges out of the way the second one it reaches up with its  claw and slaps just parries its axe out of the way and just glares at it and you /none/ can see at that  moment the giant also itself is like growls ending their turn lyra youre up  felicia oh what finally me all right i am going to get my big spell out now can i target  its wing and try to disintegrate can i try to cut its wing off  matt you know what yeah if you want to go ahead and try that its going to be a disadvantage on  the attack roll  felicia what is that  travis roll it twice and you get the lower number  matt but /none/ does disintegrate have  felicia it doesnt have a dc  matt then it would have an advantage on the saving throw  felicia oh okay no im going to try to hit it its my big gun i dont want to be like sorry  im like i just did this and it looked amazing  sam which one are you doing  felicia im doing disintegrate and its 10d6 plus a d10 plus 40 right its not the best  roll guys theres a lot of small numbers here  travis yeah its only got plus 40 its /none/ a pretty shrimpy hit  laura wait plus 40  matt yeah its 10d6 plus 40 force damage  travis i need to get a wand  matt disintegrates nasty  felicia 39  matt 39 plus 40 all right thats 79 points of damage whats the dc its 17 on that for your  spells  felicia yes  matt it does make its saving throw so half damage but rounding up thats 40 damage still  40 force damage to the dragon as you with the swelling of energy that scanlan gave you reminding  you of aldor /none/ you release and once again that sickeningly green beam of arcane energy just  streaks out hits the dragon and with a burst of arcane energy you can see part of its scales have  withered part of its wing is now tattered and missing and immediately the physical form of the  dragon its reeling in pain  laura so if we aim at that area that doesnt have scales  matt youll find out  mary but youve still got the witch bolt wrapping around him yeah  matt that is focused  felicia i definitely want to /none/ move i want to move over there behind that over here yeah so im a  little less conspicuous  matt all righty cool that will be the top of the round percy youre up  taliesin still no handgrenade  matt no the fear has shaken you so you cannot move closer to it and you have disadvantage on  attacks  taliesin what do i do to shake the fear  matt at the end of your turn you make a saving throw to try and shake it you cant move closer  to it but you can /none/ still attack it you cannot move closer to it and your attacks have  disadvantage  taliesin okay im going to try and take a shot at it with a standard shot for right now  matt okay so because youve shot reloaded shot reloaded go for it  taliesin 17 wait and with disadvantage  felicia oh no thats a great 20 you cant use  matt yeah so a total of 17 as you fire it wouldve hit unfortunately it streaks through the  portion of the wing that currently is left a gaping hole thanks to the /none/ disintegrate spell the  impact of the bullet itself blasting against the back wall sending chunks and shards of ice  spilling off in the distance  taliesin i would like to really quickly then go into that little corner there for some cover  matt okay all right cool so that ends your turn vex youre up next  taliesin oh i didnt roll to shake off the fear  matt go ahead and make the save  travis singing shake it off  all singing shake it off  matt whatd you roll  taliesin five  matt /none/ five yeah the fear is still clutching you internally like shit dragon bad dragon  vex  laura can i see him at all  matt right now no you can see parts of the wings fluttering over but you dont have a very  good visual on it  laura and hes pretty far away  matt hes decent distance yeah  laura if i just try to bowstring noise up  matt you can try to it has threequarters cover so it gets a plus five to its armor class  laura and im at disadvantage does it /none/ seem like if i cast something that would do mass damage  would the giant then not want to attack with us anymore  matt thats a risk youd have to take  travis drop some stank on that dragon  laura im scared to hit the giant with it because i want to do conjure barrage but im  afraid of the giant  felicia well if you do damage to him the spell breaks  laura exactly so that would be bad  sam but hes not fighting for us because of a spell right now we convinced /none/ him  felicia and taliesin well  laura potentially  travis look at the poker face on that dm giving up nothing giving up nothing  felicia stonefaced  laura should i try it  taliesin i dont know what do i know  mary if we damage it this spell that ive been talking to him with goes poof  laura all right then im going to try to hit the dragon with a regular attack im not going to do  conjure barrage  matt all right so whats the first range increment on your longbow  laura /none/ its 120  matt thats the first range increment yeah its a longbow yeah so youre not at disadvantage  from that shot however it does have threequarters cover and given that  circumstance  taliesin does she not have sharpshooter  laura i dont thats not the feat that i took i took read lips im really good in populated  areas  matt so go for it and roll for the attacks  laura okay cool here we go yeah no doesnt hit  laughter  felicia were going to die  matt you pull back and release /none/ the first arrow it actually just barely scrapes the top of the  platform and shatters across the ice  mary come on  laura thats better 27  matt 27 even with the threequarters cover does hit go ahead and roll damage  cheering  laura okay what is that 12 13 14 plus a d6 because im badass plus six thats 19 thats  not even close to 40 but it does something  matt its still damage so as you release the arrow it just misses the top of the platform and  you get just enough /none/ of an angle that it hits one of the wings as it pulls it up sticks into the  part of its hand that crests the top of the wing it growls  laura and i say fuck you  matt okay and it echoes fuck you fuck you do you or trinket wish to move  laura were as far away as we can be and i cant move any closer  matt thats true so now you and trinket both make wisdom saving throws to try and shake the  fear oh and youre frightened so actually roll /none/ again on the attack disadvantage on the attacks  just roll again youre frightened  laura no both of those sucked the first one was 20 20 was the first  matt so a total of 20 for the second roll well that would hit well no it has  threequarters cover so it wouldnt unfortunately  laura matthew mercer  matt you were frightened its part of the effect i had to remind myself that so the arrow  splinters off the top of the wing as it reaches upward and you still feel the fear clutching your  /none/ physical self  laura now we try to shake it off  matt now you try and shake it off  laura sings i shake it off  mary sings shake it off  matt first roll is for you  laura i do not succeed its a three  matt that would be a no sorry for trinket  laura 20 why did you say the first one was for me why couldnt the second one be for me  matt because thats how it works so while youre still scared you look over and you see trinket  /none/ shakes it off trinket looks over his shoulder at you and gives you a nod of like i got this turns  back to the dragon and gives a roars giant grizzlybear growl and shout at the dragon do you  wish to move at all  laura where is he  matt trinkets right here  laura hes going to run up for the time being and hide give me this  felicia hide why is everyone hiding  laura hes not hiding hes going to run up to this area so that hes got a better vantage point /none/  to run up for the next turn  matt thats about as far as trinket can get right there  laura he cant get any further into this little crevice  matt unfortunately no  laura can he run right here  matt trinket could move here instead thats as far as trinket could move on his movement  laura thats not really protecting him is it  matt no but its not over in a cluster of other people  laura all right  matt all right does that end your turn rimefang who currently has this giant /none/ in its  face angrily decides to instead as a legendary action at the end of your turn actually before  it takes its turn as youve misfired and trinkets running along its going to go ahead and use one  of its legendary actions to do a wing attack against the giant in front of it  mary no derek  travis laughs derek its gary  mary gary he told me telepathically that his name is actually derek  matt this is an interesting point remember this is a dragon its your favored enemy so keep that in /none/  mind you have an advantage on attacks against it  laura do i no i dont i looked it up today yo i dont get shit on attacks for him because we  transferred over from pathfinder all i can do is talk to him  matt the chat keeps yelling that the favored enemy  laura well chat i looked it up and i dont think i have advantage  matt thats true chat youre wrong  shouting  laura i literally texted matt today and i was super upset  zac did chat try to challenge the /none/ dm  matt apparently  laura seriously i thought i had it too and then i looked it up in fifth edition  i dont get that  matt as a favored enemy she gets benefits but not specifically in battle its more about  knowing  sam i appreciate the chat please keep it coming  mary couldnt that inspire vex in some way dont you get an inspiration roll from the chat  matt sorry  felicia you know whats good is that its a different team next week because were all going  to die  mary /none/ no lyra youre our leader come on  matt sorry chat youre wrong tried to go with you there but youre wrong  laura i shouldnt have even said anything i shouldve just gone with you im an idiot  matt thats okay no worries but thank you for being honest and wrong chat all right  nevertheless its going to do a wing attack against the giant in front of it the giant is  trying to make a dexterity saving throw does not the giant is knocked prone from the wings whoosh  buffeting it with wind as /none/ it begins to take off knocking the giant back and dealing 13 points of  bludgeoning damage the dragon then picks up and lands right there and rears back its head  snarling roar and unleashes a torrent of freezing cold dragons breath a 60foot cone  its going to hit the giant its going to hit lyra and its going to hit percy  taliesin do i not have some cover  matt not against dragons breath unfortunately so i need both of you guys to go ahead and make a  constitution saving throw from the sheer freezing /none/ cold  felicia oh no that didnt go well for me  sam plus three  felicia oh thats true no thats damage  taliesin 20  sam wait she gets my inspiration on this throw  matt if she chooses to use it yes  felicia yes i definitely want to use it  matt so add a d10 to what you rolled  felicia ten thank god because thats a 21  matt 21 okay all right so both of you take half of the 54 damage it wouldve dealt  laura 54 damage  matt you both /none/ take 27 points of cold damage the giant that had been partially disintegrated before  by lyra now takes the brunt of the frozen damage and you can now see the ice begins to build up  around it as it gurgling gurgles as its lifes blood is now stilled while frozen in place the  ice around its physical form holding it there as a statue of death the giant is no more  travis and mary no  laura what no  sam grog go get his axe its really big  laura is it too big to /none/ carry hes got a flaming axe right now  matt all right and that ends rimefangs turn grog youre up  travis i would like to race back from whence i came to attack his right flank if i could  matt you could get there you will have to make actually no you can move through there without  an issue  travis also i have darkvision up to 60 feet  matt you rush up towards the dragon  travis id like to take my firebrand warhammer and activate it ignite it  matt as a bonus action /none/ well its already been ignited youve had it flaming this whole time  travis oh beautiful yeah its like a torch which means i can see even better id like to go  into a frenzied rage and start swinging away  matt all right so three attacks on the big old dragon  travis 19  matt 19 does hit  travis beautiful 25  matt does hit  travis and 23  matt all three hit go ahead and roll damage  laura okay so this is the new thing d10 plus five plus eight plus another  /none/ travis d10  laura yeah  matt youre hitting with a weapon thats not as big as your greataxe but you do an additional 1d6  fire damage when you hit  travis holy shit ah  matt d10 and a d6 together three times plus eight to each  travis three d10s  laura yes plus 3d6  matt plus eight to what you roll on both of those  travis you threw a bunch of numbers at me  matt all right so a d10 and a d6 plus eight  travis 19  matt 19 damage  /none/ travis do i do that three times oh wow 19 and thats 12  matt 12 all right  travis 12 and then help me numbers thats  laura oh thats good 16 plus ooh 21  matt nice whack as you bring the warhammer down it smacks the side of the dragon the flames  all of a sudden burst off of it from the impact you can see as you pull back the white scales are  burned and charred and blackened behind from the first attack you bring it back slam again on the  second part /none/ as you do the dragon roars out in pain the actual force of the impact almost  sending it to catch itself on the other side of its body its head swings around to look at  whoevers slamming it in the side as you bring the hammer back swing underneath and then hit it from  underneath the bottom of its torso right where its ribs would be with a crunch crack sound  you hit it a third time leaving a second giant charred mark where you made impact  travis yes  matt thatll end your turn /none/ zahra youre up  mary all right ive still got witch bolt  matt you do  mary and its still going yes  matt you dont have to roll to attack again you just use your action  mary i just fucking keep going with the fucking witch bolt can i use a cantrip or will that  dispel the witch bolt  matt no because most cantrips take an action so you would not be able to the witch bolt is your  action almost all cantrips are actions to use them so youd be either able to /none/ use your action  and the witch bolt or use the cantrip your choice  mary no no im going to stick with witch bolt im very happy with this  matt so you focus yet again your eyes still glowing in that strange midnight moon color with  this black smoke thats framing the side of it you take your staff and force your will through it  once again that connection between you and the dragon and that weird swirling greenishblue  energy that surrounds the dragon connects with your staff and as it does it sends another /none/ bolt  of otherworldly energy careening into the side of the dragon go ahead and roll damage  laura i watch her with my mouth agape  travis d12  laura five times  travis we got you  mary 12 17  travis 19  laura and travis ooh 30  laura and mary 37  laura and one more  travis no thats five  matt that was five then you roll a 1d6 on top of that  mary plus two on that  matt all right so 38 then a d6 from your hex  mary /none/ six  matt so 44 points of damage  laura nice  matt as it once again a giant piece of the dragons scales shatter off the side like youre  cracking into the center of an icy mountainous cragside its starting to show a little bit of  damage you guys are definitely taking this battle headon pretty well so far  travis i dont like the way he said that  matt youre going to stay where you are or are you going to move  mary how close am i to it  matt youre currently 20 /none/ feet away from the dragon 15 is between the two of you  mary all right i stay within 30 feet of it  matt all right so you want to move this way  mary i want to get up to the heavens oh sorry im going to actually you know what im going to  move three feet backwards thats it  matt okay so you just step back okay there you go all right that ends zahras turn scanlan  youre up  sam how close am i  matt you are currently about 20 feet away /none/ from the dragon  sam all right yes hi scanlan here ill do singing its bigbys hand bigbys hand  shamone ill just punch him in his dragon face  matt laughs okay you do a quick little hand gesture hum to yourself the arcane ritual and a  very large mystical seethrough replica of your fist appears in the air above you and goes  spinning off in the air in an arc straight up popeyepunching towards the dragon laughs lets  go ahead and bigby what do you have to roll for that  sam oh i have /none/ to roll for that  matt let me see what the effect is on that remind myself real fast bigbys hand all right  so its an ac of 20 or no thats the hand all right clenched fist cool so make a melee spell  attack so roll a d20 and then add your spell attack modifier  sam thats the spell attack bonus thing okay 19  matt 19 wham just barely hits as the fist goes slamming into the side of the dragons face big  old popeye punch to the side of the jaw so go /none/ ahead and roll 4d8 points of force damage  sam 4d8 im taking yours and i hope thats okay ten 13 18 21 plus something  matt thats 21 points of damage nice whack it gets socked in the jaw the hand whips around  again preparing for the next round do you want to use anything move use your bonus action  sam im 20 feet away i will go 18 feet away from it and drop the grenade  matt okay so you move forward right here  sam yeah closer to it  matt okay the grenade /none/ is right there on the ground that percy made all right going to stay  where you are  sam can i keep moving  matt you can keep moving you moved 18 feet backward you mean  sam no i had to move closer to it  matt right so you moved three feet of your 25 feet dropped it and you still have 22 feet you  can move  sam but if i leave hes going to whack me  matt no hes this far away you have to be within a certain range for him to /none/ hit you  sam wait how close did i put the grenade to him  matt its currently 18 feet away from him  sam no i wanted to put it two feet away from him  matt oh i see there that makes more sense so now there is a grenade on the ground right there  you are there right next to grog so yeah you cannot move away without it taking a swipe  travis oh look at that  sam hello im a little gnome  travis its adorable  matt all right that ends your /none/ turn the giant thats here gets up thats half of its movement  its enough to get there moves up behind and is going to make two of its axeswipes  mary hit him in the arse  felicia butthole  sam that was crass  matt 15 doesnt hit second attack is going to be a 13 its rolling shit it swings twice and  manages to catch air  felicia the most useless giant  matt apparently but you know what they didnt smash you yet thats a good thing that brings us  to lyras turn  /none/ felicia question can i fireball without hitting anybody whos friendly  matt from this point of view its going to be very difficult to pull that off its a 20foot  radius so its going to hit everything within that sphere  travis oh you actually care about us that much  mary can i use everybody is really close all right  felicia okay so i cant do that i think im going to cast hold monster  matt hold monster you take your arcane thoughts and you put them around imagining this arcane  cage that begins to /none/ form out of the ether around the dragon these bars crash and tighten around  it the dragon rolls a two for its saving throw  cheering  matt but its going to use its legendary resistance to automatically succeed  felicia how many of those does he have  travis he has one more  felicia i need to move  matt laughs the cage tightens around it and the dragon takes its wings and shattering buffs  it off the arcane cage shatters and disappears into the air  felicia i was going to be impressive okay im /none/ going to get the h out im going to get as far as  i can in that corner yeah thank you byebye  matt all righty good to know all right that ends your turn that brings us back to the top  percy youre up  taliesin okay im going

well thats all right /none/  laura yeah but its also going to hit scanlan  matt you still have disadvantage on your attacks by the way  taliesin even if my attack is not against the dragon  matt as long as its within eyesight of you youre scared  taliesin okay in that case im going to take a shot at the dragon for the moment  matt okay  taliesin forget about that  matt disadvantage on the shot  taliesin 19  matt 19 thats with disadvantage does hit  cheering  taliesin oh thats nice 26 points of damage  /none/ matt 26 points of damage nice  sam hey percy  taliesin i have moments  matt all right and you reload with the other one you cant move closer to it do you wish to  move at all  taliesin no im going to hold my position  matt okay before the end of your turn  taliesin i was about to say before i do that im going to use a bonus action to do a quick  heal im going to use second wind  matt oh a second wind go for it so you go /none/ ahead and heal yourself 1d10 plus your level  taliesin thats 11 points of damage  matt there you go so you heal 11 points of damage before your turn is over its going to  use its last legendary action to take its tail and swing around and whack it at the gnome that it  heard sneak up behind it and drop something on the ground thats going to be a natural 20  shouting  laura he said it so happily too evil  taliesin youre in trouble  sam wait what did he do  matt /none/ as you drop it you look up and see its tail go whoosh whack  sam whoa but can i sing real quick  matt its a natural 20 theres no way you can avoid this hit  sam maybe itll fling me away from the grenade  felicia singing bye bye bye  travis no not cool  matt 36 points of bludgeoning damage as the tail slams down onto you  laura and also onto the grenade  sam but its not a concussion grenade  travis oh im right fucking there i was going to move  /none/ laura im sorry  matt and down onto the grenade you set on the ground boom  sam is it a concussion grenade its already armed isnt it  matt it is filled with black powder and is a triggerable mechanism  laura im sorry i dont know why i said that  matt i appreciate the reminder because i totally forgot for a second as it slams into you and the  ground it slams into the grenade and theres an explosion muffled sound from underneath its tail  i want grog and scanlan to go ahead and make /none/ dexterity saving throws  travis yes 21  laura come on scanlan  sam 20  matt all right both of you guys manage to keep low to the ground avoiding most of the blast  sam im already low to the ground  matt all right both of you guys take half damage from the strike you both take 12 points of fire  and bludgeoning damage  laura did the dragon take damage  matt the dragon does not make its saving throw against it though and takes the full whatd i  tell you guys 12  /none/ sam all right the grenade worked  cheering  matt pulls its tail up and theres like a big arc of smoke off of its tail as it pulls it up and  shakes out the pain that it just suffered  taliesin can i take this moment of engineering success to try and pull a wisdom saving throw  against my fear that i missed on my turn  matt thats right forgot that so go ahead and make your wisdom saving throw the explosion was  the inspiration you required  taliesin natural 20  cheering  taliesin /none/ it worked cackles  matt with the explosion the grenade set off you realize wait you might actually have this and  it worked you could do this  taliesin i built a thing and it blew up kind of on purpose  matt there you go at the end of your turn thats its final legendary action  vex youre up  laura can i try to shake off the attack  matt at the end of your turn you do  laura oh at the end but i was inspired by that explosion  matt it was inspiring /none/ it may help you shake it off at the end of the round  laura okay im going to attack it oh thats such a good roll  mary that is oh thats even better  laura thats okay it was a disadvantage thats 27 with a disadvantage with the exploding arrow  matt with the exploding arrow that does hit  travis more percy goodness  laura so what do i do do i just roll regular  matt so go ahead and roll regular arrow damage with an additional 2d6 sorry 3d6 well with the  arrow its /none/ 2d6 the grenade was 3d6 youre 2d6  laura oh shit 16 and then 3d6  matt 3d8 sorry  laura 3d8  matt sorry 3d8 was

exploding arrow  sam nice  travis 18  sam 11  matt okay  laura i also meant to say i was shooting from my bloodseeker bow i pulled it out and said i was  going to do it  matt you pull out your bloodseeker bow  laura i was going to shoot from my bloodseeker bow for that  matt okay  laura can i do that  matt ill let it so it is now taking an ongoing ten points of bleeding /none/ damage now you take three  points of fire damage scanlan you take six points of fire damage you guys avoid the grenade  and then arrow noises a second explosion again  taliesin im sorry im a genius im sorry sorry oh god im clever  laura so for my second attack i want to throw trinket in and i want trinket to  go up and attack him  matt trinket rushes in and is going to make two attacks at it  laura hes going to do two claw attacks so thats 2d4 each time  matt /none/ go for it so go ahead and roll for the first strike hes no longer scared so trinket  does not have the disadvantage  laura okay he doesnt hit on the first one but the second one he gets a 21  matt 21 hits go ahead and roll damage  laura yes okay was i wrong  mary thats 23  laura oh okay either way  matt it hits even harder  mary it hits harder  matt irish accent exactly whats that about rightly so  laura thats 13 extra damage for trinket  matt 13 /none/ extra damage as trinket runs up first strike hits the armor and just streaks across  without damage but as soon as the dragon turns around to see the giant brown bear that has gotten  brave enough to strike it its other claw goes and sinks into the side of one of its calves and tears  a portion of the dragons flesh it snarls roars and trinket bringing its claw down roars back at  it dragon roar versus bear roar all right that ends your turn it is now rimefangs turn  rimefang  mary he has /none/ no more of these legendary saves yes  sam no he has one  matt well one more legendary resistance  felicia he used a wingbuffet and then two saves  sam hes got one more  felicia oh one more save ugh  sam if he chooses to use it he might save it for later in the fight  matt great so the dragon is now going to flapping fly  sam no he wont i cast a spell on it as it retreats from me because i am a war caster  matt okay  sam and /none/ i will cast bigbys hand to grapple that shit and pull him back down  cheering  matt thats right you took the war caster feat okay  sam dont you fly away from me motherfucker  travis so hot for you right now  matt all right so you use your action to do bigbys clenched no grasping hand no its  sam its the grapple one to pull its wings together so it cant fly away  matt yes all right so so you use the hands strength score so go ahead and roll a d20 and  /none/ then add plus eight to it  sam 18 plus eight 26  matt as the dragon brings its wings up the hand grabs its wings together and forces it back down  to the ground it shakes off the effect but its unable to fly away  sam you will leave when burt reynolds tells you to leave  laughter  matt okay you also deal 2d6 plus five damage to it  sam 2d6 thats another 18  matt 18 points of damage as the hand crushes on it holding it in place it does not get a /none/ chance  to move all right angrily in reaction to that the dragon well first off let me see does not  get its breath weapon back yet unfortunately it is going to use multiattack so it gets three  attacks one bite and two claw attacks its going to make all of them against you  sam of course it does and thus ends scanlan  travis and mary no  matt well make each attack as it goes so the first attack against you is going to be the bite  attack that is a 23 to hit /none/  sam that hits  matt all right  laura are you unconscious  sam i will be very soon  matt thats going to be 18 points of piercing damage  laura oh no scanlans unconscious  matt are you unconscious okay it would be an additional d8 points of cold damage scanlan falls  unconscious on the ground its going to take a claw attack down its already allin its second  claw attack hits you immediately fail a death saving throw from the second strike the second  claw attack hits you as well as its focused /none/ on you youve failed two death saving throws  laura oh my god  sam its a dragon  matt thats the end of his turn grog youre up  travis i race over to scanlan and i pour a level3 healing potion into scanlans mouth  matt okay so grog you use your action to pull out grab scanlan and pour it into his mouth  this is the superior one  travis yes  matt you heal 8d4 plus eight hit points  sam do i roll does he roll  matt ill let you roll for it /none/ its fine  sam 8d4 can i roll 4d8s  matt laughs 8d4  sam 8d4  matt you have a better chance actually  travis this is my friend of the lady favors i need him  matt as you see the dragon bites down on him he falls unconscious on the ground the ice around  his wounds and his eyes just roll back into his head unconscious one claw slams down into his  body the gnome shakes from the impact the second claw comes down into his torso and pulls back you  can see bits /none/ of flesh and muscle pull back from its claw as it pulls away and scanlans on  deaths door you rush over and grab and lift him up take the healing potion pop off the cork with  your teeth and you ragefeed him the potion drink it  sam im at 19 now  matt so youre at 19 hit points and youre conscious now the wounds seal up youve still  failed two death saving throws theyre gone until the end of the battle  travis can i do anything else after ive poured it into his can /none/ i do anything else  matt you have a bonus action  travis can i throw him the fuck away from the dragon pick him up and chuck him towards lyra  matt ill say because youre frenzied raged normally you would get an additional attack i  will say you can use that  travis and i wont throw ill slide him on the icy floor towards lyra  matt okay go ahead and make an athletics check  travis okay natural 20  cheering  matt as he wakes up grog goes grunts whoosh and slipnslides you across /none/ the icy floor you  come to a stop about 15 feet away actually be about there youre still prone youre on the  ground  laura but you can take a potion on your turn at least  travis and i just turn around and give it the eyebrow of yourefuckingdead  matt laughs all right that ends grogs turn zahra youre up  mary witch bolt fucking witch bolt  matt by the way your bigbys hand has faded because when you fell unconscious you lost  concentration witch bolt  mary if youre still within range i /none/ push even harder for scanlans sake  matt all right go ahead and roll 5d12 i believe it is  mary the fire turns from white to yellow im raging what is it  matt whatever the spell is is it 5d10 or 5d12  mary it is 5d12  matt there you go 5d12 plus

very scared  matt that is nasty all right so as you blast again the fury of seeing scanlan torn down to the  ground and nearly devoured by this dragon you blast again this time the greenishblue energy  flaring up into a vibrant angry yellow and now /none/ you can see what once was almost like a bolt of  arcane moon energy becomes an actual burning fire in its visual do you wish to move or are you  going to stay where you are  mary im still how many feet away from him  matt you are currently 20 feet away from him  mary i will stay where i am  matt all right  mary can i give no i cant id have to go and give it to him wouldnt i  matt at the end of your turn because its regained /none/ its legendary actions its going to use  a wing attack against grog and every creature around it including trinket and the one giant so  as it takes the hit from the witch bolt heavy breathing the arcane hand no longer grasping its  wings its wings flare out whoosh and swings around with its wings hitting everything around  you dexterity saving throw for grog for the giant and for trinket giant does not make it  travis 18  matt 18 its a dc 19 make it for trinket  laura ten  matt all right so /none/ trinket and grog both take 13 points of bludgeoning damage and are both knocked  prone  travis halved because im raging  laura halved because hes got stoneskin  matt yeah trinket takes half damage as well so you both take seven points of bludgeoning damage  but youre still knocked prone you both fall onto your back the giant also is knocked prone there  all right that ends zahras turn that brings us to scanlan youre conscious youre on the  ground  sam i will stand  matt all right so you still have half your /none/ movement you can still move roughly ten feet any  direction  sam taking a potion is an action or a bonus  matt i consider it a bonus action to keep things moving action to administer it to somebody else  travis do that thing  sam i will dimension door way over there  matt laughs okay scanlan stands up waves his hand and this blackened archway just whoosh  appears next to him with this crackling sound of energy he leaps through it and vanishes out of  sight you are now in darkness you cannot see /none/ anything except for a little bit of light bouncing  off of the top of the cavern glittering across all the ice crystals but you are in complete  shadow breathing heavily  sam and ill take one of those four healing potions that someone gave us were they moderate  matt they were superior i think grog used one  felicia yeah we handed them out  sam okay i definitely have one so ill take it  matt 8d4 plus eight  laura who all took them  mary i didnt because i have two  felicia i /none/ dont think she and i took them  laura oh the four of us because were assholes  matt i think you each took one  felicia i sacrificed myself  matt so well consider that its fine all right so that ends scanlans turn the giant is  going to get up  travis get up gary you piece of shit  matt that would be a 21 that hits and thatll be a 17 that misses but it does manage to hit  with an attack finally this whole time thats 24 points of slashing damage to the /none/ dragon as its  first strike whiffs and as it brings it back with a backhand it brings its shield up to protect  itself the axe smack lands a good seven to eight inches into the dragons hide roars the  head turns around you traitor i will eat every one of you that ends the giants turn its  going to stay right there trying to finish him off that ends the giants turn lyra youre up  felicia i still cant fireball right  matt you could depending on where you want to place it you may /none/ hit other things  laura you can place it hit the giant and the dragon  felicia then the giant will wake up if we hit the giants does he look almost dead  matt you can tell hes taken a few hits from the dragon but the other one is the one that was  completely wrecked  laura is the other giant dead  matt it is frozen in place and dead it was partially disintegrated by lyra earlier and the  frost breath finished it off  felicia i could maybe hit trinket or grog  sam /none/ trinkets protected  felicia i dont think hes protected from fire damage its a lot of damage i dont want to kill  trinket  travis is it fire and its a frost dragon  felicia its a very big spell its 8d6 cant really use it ill try to hold monster again  laura how much radius does the dragon take up  matt the dragon itself is 15 feet across on each side so if you were to hit the dragon it would  still hit everything directly around it  felicia yeah let me try to hold /none/ monster again at least force him to use his thing  matt all right actually he fails his saving throw but uses his third and final legendary  resistance to resist the hold monster spell  taliesin good you drained it thats over with  matt hes out of legendary resistance he turns around and looks at you now it was currently  glaring at the giant growling at everyone around it and as soon as that spell hits it with the  cage once again heavy impacts it breaks it with its wings and turns around whoosh and opens /none/ its  mouth right towards you  felicia im going to move away as far as i can  matt okay so you are here  felicia yes thats very far yes thank you  matt okay all right that ends your turn back up to percy  taliesin all right im going to take one last really good shot im going to shoot him right in  the face again im going to spend my grit point and hit him in the face lets make this work  yay that hits thats 31 to hit  matt 31 will /none/ hit yeah go ahead and roll damage  taliesin im going to roll damage thats 15 points of damage but hes got disadvantage on all  attacks until my turn  matt he did take ten points of bleeding damage from your laura it did take ten points of  bleeding damage from your bow and it does save against the bleed effect so thats gone  unfortunately but you did ten additional damage to him  taliesin im going to move in this direction hug the wall  matt right there  taliesin yeah i think right there  /none/ matt okay so as you take your shot gunshot it ricochets off the armor the dragons starting to  look a little rough you can see bits of the blood beginning to seep from the inside of its scales  its starting to look a little harsher and harsher its still standing up pretty well but  you can see its starting to get a little more battleworn that ends percys turn  vex youre up  laura me  matt yes  laura okay im going to move trinket away  matt trinket stands up and trinkets going to /none/ move back this way  laura yeah and then hide behind that outcropping thing yeah  matt okay as he moves away the dragon uses his reaction its going to be a bite attack on him  actually  taliesin with disadvantage  matt with disadvantage  taliesin with disadvantage  matt oh because of the head shot yeah well it rolled a two and a 15  cheering  matt so thank god you put that on there so as it whoosh lashes out trinkets armor actually  takes the impact and some of the teeth crack a little /none/ bit against the armor and the jaw pulls  back as trinket just bear moan runs off behind the ice wall what are you doing  laura im going to cast hail of thorns  matt did you make a wisdom save last turn to try to resist the fear effect  laura i did and i failed it  matt thats right okay  laura yeah so im going to cast hail of thorns on the dragon  matt okay go ahead and roll for attack  laura 26  matt 26 hits yes hail of thorns whats the /none/ radius on that  laura thats a good question hail of thorns  matt laughs hows that go  laura okay wait next time you hit a creature with a ranged weapon spell range it just hits  it but then everything within five feet makes a dexterity saving throw sorry guys  matt so grog make a dexterity saving throw because youre prone id say with disadvantage  laura oh sorry grog  travis nine  matt actually youre fine just straight roll  travis oh great 18  matt 18 all right you take half of the 1d10 /none/ piercing damage so roll for the actual arrow  damage and then 1d10 the giant does not make it and the dragon does not make it they both fail  laura 13 for the actual arrow plus another five for hunters mark  matt all right whats the 1d10 for the hail of thorns  laura 3d10 because im casting it at 3rd level 18 for the hail of thorns  matt 18 so thats nine points of damage to you grog nine points to the giant and nine points to  the dragon all right  laura oh and /none/ then i get another attack  matt you do you have two attacks  laura giggles this is crazy okay so im going to should i do conjure barrage conjure barrage  at them as well  matt all right conjure barrage is an action to cast right  laura oh youre right so a regular i can only do a regular attack okay so regular attack oh  that doesnt hit thats a 16  matt that unfortunately does not hit well it hits but the arrow shatters across the dragons  armor all right that ends your turn /none/ as the giant takes a blasting impact of thorns across its  torso it looks to the dragon rimefang looks at the rest of you which some of you have fallen  some of you are on the ground it decides that perhaps it chose its alliances poorly and you can  see it takes its axe and shield ready and almost in a phalanx format is now alongside the dragon  all right that brings us to rimefangs turn rimefang is going to flapping fly up in the  air  travis oh hes reaching for shit he duplicates /none/ himself into another dragon now youre all dead  matt now hes going to  travis oh no the ales gone  matt this way up at the top and is currently up in the air flapping lets see he gets his cold  breath back oh did you roll to try and shake the frightened effect by the way  laura i

actually i get five constitution and i rolled an 18  taliesin 15  /none/ matt 15 what did you roll vex  laura 18  matt 18 all right chuckles so as the ice breath whoosh passes across its like every  center point of the worst ice storm or blizzard impacting you with a series of punches every  single second as this breath caresses and beats your body left and right both of you guys take 54  points of cold damage  taliesin 54  matt 54 lyra you take 27 points of cold damage  travis and the room gets quiet  mary really fast  matt it continues its /none/ flight pattern flapping impacts and lands on top of this upper platform  laura oh hes got another fucking platform  sam how high up  matt thats ten feet up there are two platforms on opposite sides of this room now that ends its  turn it is now grogs turn  travis that giant is definitely against us  matt it looks to be questioning its loyalty at the moment yeah  travis you questioned at the wrong time i charge gary and hack away  matt all right you get up and you have enough movement definitely /none/ to move up into battle with  him go ahead and attack  travis laughs what do i do again what is this shit this thing plus five 16 no

forward whack whack the first two hits one hits in the side and you can  see it grunts reacts the second one it brings its shield up and you /none/ splinter the buckler shield  on its arm and as it shatters you can see the bones in its arm crunch crack from the impact  and it drops its arm to one side with the flames itself beginning to set fire to the furs it has on  its arm grunts he tries to shake off the fire thats on its arm as you see it bring its arm up  it reveals the underside of its torso you use that to reach down leap in the air with an  overhead swipe slam this warhammer with all your /dung/ strength into the side of its ribcage as you do  crack you can see its torso cave in and youre probably sure that the splintered bones seem to  have impacted something serious as the giant all of a sudden death rattle  cheering  mary dead dead  matt from the damage left over from the battle you had earlier the damage it already took from  the dragon and that was just enough to finish it off by two hit points that ends your turn grog  zahra youre up  mary how far away from the /none/ dragon am i  matt you are 30 feet away  mary thats exactly right which means witch bolt is still in effect and im going to fucking  unleash on this white wyrm of death  matt all right boof a third time now you release witch bolt it slams into it the dragon  actually tries to shift out of the way  mary he cant  matt he cant because youre locked in  mary you cant get away from me  matt go ahead and roll damage  laura creepy zahra  mary creepy zahra well /none/ i am a demon all right 11  travis 27 39 48 1d6 53  mary 53  felicia damn  travis you bad bitch  matt all right so it tries to dodge out of the way this time as you focus again the yellowish  energy has now transitioned to a deep hot searing red flame from your eyes  mary oh you cant run  matt boof you focus again the beam now transitioning into a similar redhot color  streaks across and slams into the side of the dragon you can see the impact the scales /none/ are  left with this glowing red heat from the blast and part of its armor is torn open you can see  the burncharred muscle beneath the dragons looking pretty rough do you wish to move or are  you staying right there  mary im going to approach it by five feet  matt there you go that brings us to scanlans turn you are way over here  sam i will first use my bonus action on myself can i cast healing word on myself  matt yeah sure  sam okay d4 plus five thats nothing /none/ actually wait can i just take a potion as a bonus action  matt if you want to yeah

matt all right  travis yes dude way not to be dead  felicia way to not die  travis i need my whoring partner  matt all right at the end of your turn its going to use one of its legendary actions to make  a tail attack and reach over the side /none/ here at percy whos trying to stay hidden there brings  around his tail whoosh comes swinging down over the side another natural 20  groaning  felicia he looks disappointed  laura he doesnt want us to die  felicia its going to happen  mary no would you stop it lyra come on  felicia im sorry i have selfesteem issues  mary not today you dont  matt 32 points of bludgeoning damage to you percy whack from over the top  taliesin im out  matt percy is down as the tail whack slams him down /none/ you can see now as the tail pulls back the  ice on the ground is slightly concave theres pieces of ice that have shattered and jutted up  from the impact as the tail pulls away dropping chunks of stone and ice you can see a  currently unconscious percy is now facedown and pushed probably a good halffoot into the ground  itself your face is a mess if they ever pull you up from that right now  taliesin i like my face  matt that ends scanlans turn the giant is dead there are no giants /none/ theyre gone lyra youre  up  felicia okay i can fireball him now  cheering  felicia fireball ooh that looks pretty good six and six and six  laura come on lyra

save  felicia 17  matt 17 okay it rolled a 15 plus five so it is half damage /none/ but thats still 26 points of damage  to it  felicia its not bad  matt explosion noise as you reach out this arcing bead of red streaks through the darkness  impacts right at the side of the dragons wing and then boof bursts into a giant ball of flame  the whole cavern rocks from the sound of the impact as the dragon pulls back you can see this  giant char mark on the outside of its wing its looking pretty rough its still standing but  its looking pretty rough unfortunately the radius of the /none/ blast as it is a 20foot radius is  large enough percy his body is hit in the impact and blasted onto its back now he rolls partly out  of the impact  taliesin do i actually roll  matt you actually boof over there youre still technically in the same spot but youre on your  back now you do automatically fail a death saving throw from that  felicia oh my god im so sorry  matt all right that ends lyras turn

 laura screams okay heres the thing did he roll far enough away that he is not within ten  feet of the dragon  matt the dragon is ten feet up  laura so hes far enough away  matt in theory hed be just

not have another pike please  laura 17  matt plus your hunters mark  laura thats good thats another six for hunters mark plus another 11  matt plus another 11 okay as the arrow releases once again arrow flying it turns into  a bolt of pure arcane energy smacking into the side of it you can see the explosion hit and the  energy crackle through the rest of its body its muscles shudder and it has to grasp the side of  /none/ the top of this platform to keep itself steady you can see now the dragons heavy breathing  one eye is partially closed and with each breath you can see this frost mist emanating from its  breath it looks like its on its last legs  laura for my second attack  cheering  laura for my second attack im going to regular attack him oh my god just going to regular  attack him  matt roll for attack  laura jesus please oh its 30  matt 30 hits go ahead and roll damage  laura 13 /none/ 14 15  matt including the hunters mark  laura no four  matt okay so 19 total okay as the arrow arrow flying impacts embeds itself in the side of the  neck the dragon reaches up and its scratching at the pain as it pulls the arrow out blood begins  to pour down its side  laura ugh hes still alive  matt its rough that ends your turn  laura fuck is it his turn  matt it is now rimefangs turn rimefang turns heavy breaths roars and lets out a spray of icy  damage /none/ out in this direction at an arc this way i need to get a dexterity saving throw from lyra  from vex and from zahra  mary do i have a reaction  matt after this you will  mary okay got it  felicia eight  matt eight  laura 28  matt 28 okay zahra  mary 11  matt 11 okay so that is 54 points of damage to you  felicia im down  matt lyra is currently crackles frozen in place right now from the blast shes unconscious  and there is a coat of /none/ ice around her body holding her in place how are you doing on hit points  laura im at 28 hit points  matt okay you kick the frost off and youre on one knee and you take 54 points of ice damage  laura are you unconscious too  mary nope im not do i have a reaction  matt you have a reaction  mary i do i use hellish rebuke  sam oh what is that it sounds hellish  mary i

mary 17  matt okay so it takes 2d10 fire damage go ahead and roll that  laura yes oh my god you can kill it just because it attacked you  taliesin kill it out of spite  felicia tell him hes very ugly  mary nine  matt nine points of fire damage  how do you want to do this  cheering  mary /none/ i dont know what that means  matt how do you finish this dragon with your hellish rebuke  taliesin make it good  matt after it finishes blasting you with ice damage you watch the wizard frozen in place you  see percy unconscious and bleeding on the ground you see vex on the ground about to fall  unconscious your friends are lost in the darkness around you and suddenly you feel that tiefling  surge of anger within you and you  mary almost completely turn into flame as i walk towards it can i use anything /dung/  matt how do you want the hellish rebuke to be  mary i want this hellish rebuke to be me levitating in the air and using my dark dragon  staff to blast it from here down just eviscerating everything from the bowels down with  hellish fire  matt so after the frost takes on the front of you and there is ice caked against the front of  your armor you suddenly look up at it and as your eyes flare with flame the ice shatters  evaporates from the sheer heat your bodys emanating you take /none/ a step forward but the step  itself is about an inch off the ground a second step youre two inches off the ground and with  each progressive step youre slowly floating in the air the warlock energy now swirling around  you the shadows are spinning around you and coalescing around your feet as you look forward  towards it you see the portion of its armor that was blasted open earlier with its flesh and sinew  exposed you take the staff forward and with an angry snarl the one last blast of infernal  energy the /none/ hellish rebuke then shooting sound sinking into the side of its chest as the inside  of its flesh begins to spark and smoke the dragon grunts reaches out and grabs the side its  beginning to try to bring its wings up to fly away and as it does explosion noise a blast of  infernal flame comes cascading out of its chest you can see now all of its armor begins to peel  back as its chest is blown open its eyes suddenly go from this piercing bluewhite to a  dull gray color and it reaches /none/ out and heavy breathing no it tumbles forward onto the  ground next to percy almost crushing his unconscious form it gets up impacts takes two  more steps forward no you cant  mary yes i fucking can  cheering  matt and with that rimefang falls dead to the ground  cheering  sam i run over to lyra cast seeming on myself to give myself the appearance of aldor and i pour a  potion into her mouth and i wake her up  felicia what happened  sam you did good baby  felicia gasps and /none/ im just in him  laughter  travis i run over to percy and pour a healing potion in his mouth and i dont in him  laughter  matt you can just barely get there with your movement thank god youre a barbarian  taliesin oh what happened oh look its dead  mary hello percy  laura oh my god i stand up and i give zahra a giant hug  taliesin can we cut that bastard up for scrap now ugh  laura you were amazing  mary forever besties  felicia wait then i notice aldor /none/ why are you so short  sam baby i cant change height so i release seeming and im back to normal  felicia that was not as good a kiss as usual i was worried but it was special  travis oh  laughter  mary is it time to take what we need from this thing  laura gather up all of the shit we have to take and put it in the bag of stuff  taliesin that would be two white dragon eyes one white dragon tongue one white dragon heart  six white dragon claws and /none/ 20 white dragon teeth  matt whos harvesting this  mary you have the bag  felicia its nature who has good animal handling  laura wait we have to harvest it special  matt part of harvesting the organs from the creature is a delicate process  laura is it nature what is it a check for  matt its a naturebased check yes  laura i have a low nature what do you have  taliesin very low nature  mary i have a six nature can i harvest him  matt you can  travis can i /none/ go and loot the giant thats not frozen  matt you can you can also help with this roll  sam inspiration okay i inspire them  matt how do you inspire zahra as she goes to start carving into this dragon  sam i will sing something i dont know what im so out of it we just killed a dragon  laughter  sam i go over to her and im like incoherent impressed stammering and thats all i got  matt and with that you killed a dragon  mary it was a group effort  laura /none/ can i help at all can i assist can i hold her utensils for her  matt between the two of you working together that would give you advantage on the checks which  one are you going for first are you going for the eyes choose which portion youre harvesting  first  laura everything we need all of it dont we  matt yeah but which part are you harvesting first you choose with each roll you have eyes  heart  felicia can i assist can i help  matt we already have an assist over there /none/  felicia i want to be helpful  laura well all stand and watch  taliesin start with the eyes  laura pop them out pop those bitches out but you get an advantage  matt you will get advantage on it because shes assisting you  mary thats nine plus  laura yeah thats 15 plus six is 21  matt 21 okay as you come over using a dagger that you have pop very delicately each dragon eye  out and place it into the satchel  laura into the cooler bag  matt as you pull each /none/ eye out its like holding the coldest orb youve ever held it actually  burns your fingers as you clutch it gasp throw it inside and have to shake your hand off  laura i jiggle them around in the bag just because  felicia we have a special crate  laura yeah im holding it  taliesin the tongue would be next  matt all right go ahead and roll for that  laura plus another roll for advantage ooh thats way better plus six 23  matt 23 all right so you manage to with the help of /none/ vex pulling the jaw open grog holding  onto the side lyras supervising you manage to get to the base of the tongue carve off and you  slurppop pull out the rather massive very heavy tongue which once again this in itself  is like yelps put it in real fast and in the process of doing so you suffer two points of cold  damage but the tongue has been harvested  taliesin a heart  matt this ones going to be difficult part of the chest is blown open exposing the interior  but there has been /none/ damage done to the inside so go ahead and attempt this  travis two rolls  mary 12 14 plus six is 20  matt oh 20 20 is just what you needed you pry in and crack open a portion of its body and you  begin to slowly carve out the portion the heart and the dragon heart itself is massive its huge  and it takes three of you to pull it out  laura how do we fit it in this bag is it magic  matt you dont know but its not going to fit /none/ in that satchel  mary how heavy is it  matt id say it probably weighs a good 200 pounds  felicia i should know what people would do in the guild situation if they had an organ that wouldnt  fit in the bag right we have to preserve it  matt travel back quickly or have preservation magic whether it would be a necromancybased  magic  felicia nope  travis were not shoving it in there are we cutting it in half  laura we could roll it up in one of our fancy robes though and /none/ hold on to it and pack it in  oh we yeah lets chisel out some of the ice  matt as you begin to wrap it up you notice that the cold air begins to cracking crack around it  and the heart itself is freezing as per the nature of a freshly dead white dragon so it might  be a good thing  laura what about all this gold in the cavern  taliesin claws and teeth  mary teeth yes roll to carve seven 13  matt 13 going through the jaw you begin plucking teeth /none/ out piece by piece cling cling  and most of them you notice as part of the nature of the body are beginning to decay faster  than you expected a lot of the teeth are becoming brittle and breaking and as you start pulling  them out youre frustrated because with each one it seems to almost shatter as soon as you claw it  from the jaw by the end of it you manage to gather about three dragons teeth before the rest  of them begin to break  travis we have a shitload of dragon teeth /none/ left over  laura but we need white dragon  travis he was a white dragon  laura or wait are you sure it wasnt the blue dragon that we harvested  travis no it was a white dragon we have 37 left over  laura okay we have 37 dragon teeth from the first white dragon  mary can i also get if theres any powder left or anything for myself i would like to  taliesin claws still we have to get claws still  mary i know but if its on the ground and its in front /none/ of me i would just like to put it in my  little bag to have it for my own spellcasting  matt okay go ahead and make a nature roll for that roll two more nature checks or one more  check with advantage  laura another one  mary that sucks too 13  matt okay you managed to pull out some of the more sensitive parts of the dragon but as you  begin to cut away at some of the scales youre going for the scales or the claws  mary i was going for the /none/ powdered the remains of whatever teeth that we couldnt get  matt oh that never mind then sorry so then that you can gather without a problem its  powdered dragon ice bone so yeah thats fine all right  taliesin we still need claws  laura lets go for claws  travis one more  mary nine 15  matt 15 in beginning to pull out the portions of its hands and getting the base of where the claw  itself begins to grow you manage to pull out five functional dragon claws without them breaking  mary how /none/ many did we need percy  taliesin six do we have an extra we have one  matt you guys prepared with your bag  mary hello prepared people  travis oh i looted the giant  matt all right you looted the giant  mary now can we get some scales  laura just her all of us  matt all of you working together to get scales  felicia all of us free for all  matt well this is the roll theyre making for it  laura 20 for scales  matt 20 for scales okay so /none/ all of you working together you manage to pull off what amounts to  about 25 pounds of dragon scales mind you the scales are heavy and theyre about that big each  it would be enough if you were to bring it to a master craftsman to possibly construct a set of  armor from them  laura thats why we have so many pounds of dragon scales from the previous dragons we could make  three sets of armor right now  felicia im going to look around and just see if theres a stash or a hoard /none/ that he was gathering  matt all right there are individual gold pieces embedded all through it would take you weeks to  chisel it all from the walls  mary are there any giant gems that we can see  matt everyone make a perception check  laura i want to get my diamond back too from earlier  travis can i loot the bloody giant  laura natural 20 for perception ooh sparklies  matt all right so grog you go over to the giant thats not frozen looking at it most of its  armor itself is /none/ made for a giants form much larger than anything else and a lot of it has  been shredded by the dragon or frozen and broken from the impact and you cutting it apart with its  axe for the most part all youre able to find off of its body are approximately 120 gold pieces  which isnt bad giants dont really carry a lot of money on them usually what they carry on  them is just trophies from battles they fought previously at least these ones here what did  you roll for perception  taliesin 16 /none/  felicia 18  sam 11  mary 13  laura natural 20  matt so as you guys are looking around the cavern seems to be fairly barren you however  vex as you walk to the back of the cavern you see there are other pieces of partially eaten  frozen bodies and you using a little bit of torchlight you can pull out and glancing  underneath you see a little bit of shining more of a cluster of shining about seven or eight  inches beneath the ice surface and you look down and you can /none/ see there appears to be quite a hoard  of something frozen beneath the surface of this cavern  felicia oh i can help blasting sounds i throw a fire bolt  matt laughs you start carving youre like yelps dodge out of the way just in time as  firebolts begin blasting the ice  felicia 14 14 points of damage  matt boom boom a large chunk of the ice is blasted out from the fire bolt and you catch your  breath for a second its not enough to get all the way down but it does /none/ manage to blast away a  large portion of the ice  laura i still have like two points of health fyi  felicia oh im sorry you do look so lovely though  matt and so between the two of you guys you take a dagger you take your staff and you begin  jamming into the ice you manage to break it apart and you do find beneath there frozen  quite a hoard you find over the next hour or so 4244 gold pieces  travis and taliesin whoa  laura how much  matt 4244 gold /none/ pieces a cluster of gems worth around 850 gold a singular diamond its about  that large its actually a little bit smaller than the other one you have but its worth  anywhere in the neighborhood of 1200 gold pieces you also manage to find a pair of leather  gloves with almost gold trim around each one of the joints you find what looks like a small  leather cap that you pull over the head that a peasant would wear and what looks to be one glass  vial containing an indeterminate liquid  laura what is /none/ the color of the liquid  matt from what you can look at the color its like a purplishblue  mary can anybody do a perception check on magical liquid  travis i would like to perception check the leather hat  matt make a perception check  laura can anybody do an arcana check on the leather hat  matt oh do you have detect magic  travis 16  matt or identify spell  felicia no i thought about them  matt okay make an arcana check well you guys have a brief rest here it should be /dung/ fine  actually okay looking at it this is a very fancy leather hat  travis its a fancy leather hat its mine dibs  taliesin im curious about the gloves myself  matt you take some time with each one of these items that you pull out from the ice and each one  emanates a magical aura from them you take the gloves first and you look at them and you  eventually come to realize oh youve heard about this you read about this in your books these are  gloves of missile snaring theyre gloves that /none/ when worn you have an opportunity to possibly  snatch a missile out of the air these gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them when  a ranged weapon attack hits you while youre wearing them you can use your reaction to reduce  the damage by a certain amount provided you have a free hand if you reduce the damage to zero you  can catch the missile midair whoosh stop it from hitting you  taliesin that might be good for you though  laura for anybody with ranged probably  matt anybody /none/ whos hit by ranged  taliesin i have a twohanded ranged weapon though which you do not  matt looking at the hat itself while not a very impressive hat the magical energy on it does give  you the idea that it is used as an illusionbased magic it is a hat of disguise while wearing this  hat you can use an action to cast the disguise self spell at will it ends if the hat is  removed  sam may i have that one please  taliesin no scanlan  travis what he can already disappear /none/  felicia youll abuse it youve already abused that privilege already  sam im sorry by the way your lips taste like bubblegum  matt the potion is a potion of climbing you can actually climb your walking speed for one hour  mary like spider climb  felicia spider pig  mary whats it called  matt climbing or scaling cliffs you can go at the speed normally youre very slow when you  climb you can just parkour up super fast while this is happening because you rolled a 20 you  look over at the corpses that /none/ are frozen on the ground you see one of the corpses is wielding a  sword and another one of the corpses appears to have a shattered bow in one hand you go over and  see the sword itself is not affected by the ice it actually seems to be resisting the ice you  cracking break it out of the hand the person whos holding the bow currently the upper torso  is bitten off and shattered part of the body is ruined the bow is broken and destroyed but there  is a quiver on its back /none/ within the quiver you see most of the arrows are frozen solid within the  quiver but there is one that seems unaffected by the ice  laura can i tell what it is  matt you pull out the arrow it appears to be a deep forest green and the actual shaft of the  arrow has a texture to it almost a rough metallic texture  sam mary and travis take it  laura im taking it are you kidding me  matt if you wish to bring those over to lyra lyra make an arcana check  /none/ felicia this is a very interesting arrow i havent seen one of these like this oh wait  maybe i have 27  matt good to know you take the time with it you immediately recognize there is a similar  enchantment on both of these weapons and whoever came in here earlier had the intent of slaying  this dragon and failed to do so what you find is a dragonslayer longsword which is a plusone  weapon normally but against dragons or people of the dragon subtype it deals an additional 3d6  damage with every hit  /none/ felicia its too bad it didnt work for them  matt and an arrow of dragonslaying its a singular arrow a oneuse arrow but if it hits a  dragon of the dragon race type or group it has to make a constitution saving throw or take an  additional 6d10 piercing damage its a oneuse fuck you dragon arrow  sam 6d10  felicia thats very pleasant  laura yeah right what is the saving throw  sam youll see youre going to get the paper  matt so at this point you guys have taken probably a good /none/ hour and a half or so in this  cavern you start seeing water drip  laura oh we should get out  matt its beginning to thaw in the absence of rimefang  mary well whats good is i believe were within the three days of the contract yes  matt possibly  felicia well we got the contract we completed it within three days now we have to get back  mary yes weve killed it so lets go home  matt percy you go and you pull out the contract real fast to inspect it and you /none/ can see that the  arcane sigils that were built into it are faded and where it looks like each piece of the dragon  that you harvested correctly has seemingly had a strange glimmering gold shimmer from the actual  text on the contract  laura lyra theyre going to love you  felicia its so exciting i cant wait to go to the mess hall and tell everybody many times over  and over how this happened together and you guys this has been an amazing journey thank  you  mary i would like to take just /town/ one gold coin right at the base of the head of what was formerly  rimefang for myself ill put it in a necklace when we all go back to town  matt all right you take that one gold piece pocket it take a moment to remember your final  death blow against the dragon you guys trek back through the caverns you arose back through the  ruined frost giant village back into the vesper timberland find where your horses were currently  tied up make your way back towards the city of vasselheim about a day and /none/ a halfs worth of  travel later you notice that the blizzard that encompassed the sixmile radius of this mountain  range has faded into a soft fog and the actual weather in this area seems to have been connected  to the presence of the dragon and is slowly dissipating you eventually take yourself to the  base of vasselheims main wall you shout at the top of the wall and noticing the group arriving  they let the doors open you can see the giant dragonheaded ballistae that line the city walls  are armed and ready and /none/ upon approval they move them away you enter the city make your way  through the braving grounds to the quadroads to the outside of the slayers take guildhall as you  enter the main room you see mertin is standing there looks like hes playing a game of solitaire  with a deck of cards he looks up well ill be damned are you serious you killed him  felicia mertin we did it  matt show me your contract show me this contract  felicia i dont know why youd doubt us really its right here  matt /none/ well done and he puts his hand out to shake your hand  felicia oh my gosh i start crying this is the most proud moment of my life mertin ive admired  you for so long and the fact cries thank you and then i just hug him  matt okay he hugs you i appreciate it very much you lost me 200 gold pieces but well done  youve proven to be more than i expected let me get the huntmistress she will be very happy to  see that youve arrived aye my wife yes and he /none/ gets up and leaves a few moments later the  headmaster vanessa cyndrial comes in her tiefling self with her horns curled behind her head walks  in with this smooth glare i must say some of these contracts we put out as a test of your power  and will and to be perfectly honest i was pulling for you she puts out her hand and her  husband takes a pouch of coin and puts it in her hand she takes it and puts it on the side of her  belt im impressed by all of you /none/ and by this token and by the completed contract first off  you have definitely proven your worth to the slayers take  felicia oh my god that is so sweet vanessa  matt keep the emotions in check we have to put up a face here no one wants to see a member of  the guild cry now for the rest of you i would like to humbly ask if you wish to join the  slayers take guild  sam yeah sure thatll work the bear too  matt the bear as well best not show him /none/ the back room we have a few trophies back there that  might freak him out  travis do we get to work with another leader next time  sam what because if the answer is yes we refuse this is our leader from now on  felicia thank you so much  matt you are able to choose what your group is at any time whatever the contract requires  felicia i really appreciate it but given the kiss that we had i realized why aldor doesnt  love me is that i dont have enough experience sexually so /town/ im going to stay in town to spread  my wings in that area and then hell love me wont he vanessa  matt vanessa goes lyra i would recommend this course of action to not be taken i would think  that would reflect poorly i mean your personal time is your own but nevertheless my dear this  is a very pious house  sam i think this is a great idea  felicia oh no not you youre such a friend to me i cant ruin that  sam youre right  matt vanessa walks up and /none/ puts her hand on your shoulder and goes were going to have a talk  woman to woman  felicia whispers oh my god you guys im in  mary be straight with her will you please  matt im going to make sure she doesnt embarrass the rest of us so with the contract  completed provide what youve harvested from your quarry and payment will be delivered  laura i put the bag down thats got all the stuff in it and then we take out a couple from the  white dragon and put out the other /none/ stuff and weve got this giant heart right here  matt the heart which grog has been carrying on his back as you guys travel impact sound it  hits the table and the wood cracks a little bit beneath it from the impact and you can see the  ice is starting to melt a bit on the exterior  laura careful it needs to be preserved  matt she gives a nod very well mertin please provide these for transport to the contract  client  mary can we ask who actually contracted it  matt its written /none/ on the contract itself  mary oh thats right im so sorry  matt percy has the contract currently  taliesin i do ozwyn grud  travis grundle  felicia alchemist ozwyn grud  matt make a history check by the way  taliesin may i as well  felicia 21  taliesin 25  travis oh a history check four hes a person  mary i had four as well we are so getting shots later like now  laura nine  matt all right the two of you immediately go huh and it hits you youve heard the /none/ name  before youve heard the name and youre trying to figure out where it is you pick it up and say  hes a member of the arcana pansophical its a really exclusive group of archmages across the  entire globe that essentially work together to keep the peace on a global scale of which you  know that arcanist allura vysoren is a member of the arcana pansophical  taliesin yes of course  matt this is another member of that team who ordered this  taliesin this is most likely going to good use at the very /none/ least  sam so do we collect our money  matt indeed what is the total on that contract if you dont mind repeating  taliesin i was just working that out  laura lots of gold  taliesin lots of gold its 1800 for the dragon eyes 1200 for the dragon tongue 3500 for the  heart 1500 for the claws and then how much for the dragon teeth  laura per dragons tooth or for all six dragon teeth  taliesin for all 20 dragon teeth  matt yeah essentially considering the dragon teeth that you had already /none/ stored those are used  in this transaction as well as the claws so you no longer have dragons teeth and dragon claws  stored in your bag however youve fulfilled the contract and get full payment for those  travis we have 12 teeth left  sam so its 9000 total  taliesin 9000 total  matt 9000 gold pieces she reaches beneath pulls out a small chest you see her do something  beneath the table you dont recognize and all of a sudden you hear a clicking sound and she pulls up  three large sacks of /none/ gold heavy impacts on the table divide as you see fit on top of this as  you have now been accepted to this when your other team members arrive which should be any  moment now in the next day or so youll be inducted youll be absolved of your breach of the  laws of vasselheim and you will also acquire a small payment in conjunction with the hydra  contract so we will discuss this as soon as your friends arrive until then feel free to rest  divide the gold and be on your way  /none/ laura thats 1500 each  sam and taliesin thank you  felicia oh i dont need any laughs  laura what about you zahra  mary oh i need ill take definitely thank you  matt you do not need your money well that will go back to the guild

to a very fruitful and profitable future  together here at the /none/ slayers take  travis aye scanlan should we go and make sure that your wounds are completely healed  laura can we insight check vanessa really fast  matt you may what are you trying to gather  laura just to see what kind of person she is  matt all right go for an insight check  laura 24  matt okay you know you have a very strong sense of being able to read a person and yet she is  still an enigma to you she seems earnest she seems definitely a shrewd businesswoman and  theres /none/ a reason this guild has been successful for as long as shes been at the helm of it but  as far as reading her intent she seems very guarded and hard to read youre unable to really  catch a bead on her  felicia vanessa i want to thank you for trusting me with this very difficult task i know that you  sent some other people after this dragon and your confidence in our abilities over theirs who were  defeated its just fantastic i mean what were you thinking  travis what were you thinking  /none/ taliesin what were you thinking really  matt well to be perfectly honest this dragon had been a thorn in our side with previous  contracts failed on its side and you all seemed so confident in your skills i figured it would be  a good excuse for you to either flee from this thing and come back with your tail between your  legs or be foolish and get yourself killed in which case youre not a problem of ours anymore  and everythings fine or best case scenario what youve shown to me today  laura which /none/ is that were amazing  travis vox machina does not flee  mary never although im not a part of it  sam well make you an honorary member  matt anyway i have business to attend to enjoy your night celebrate and return here when you  wish to see your friends hopefully return as successful as you were  sam and mary thank you  travis we are sure they will  matt mertin yes i know my dear im taking it and he takes the heart and grunts lifts it  over his back and the halfling /none/ as thick as he is grunts is bringing it to the back room she  turns around gathers the rest of the materials into a sack and exits the room and with that we  will conclude tonights session well done  sam we did it  mary we survived  laura good job mary  matt by the way these are your magical items you want to go ahead and take those
