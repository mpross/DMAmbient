none	 off vox machina in their attempt to gain  power through artifacts called the vestiges of divergence to eventually destroy the chroma  conclave great evil dragons that came together to terrorize the taldorei countryside they were  seeking one in the country continent of marquet the city of ankharel after traveling there and  meeting with members of the various establishments the new culture they were  introduced to a drug deal gone awry some time in a casino some hookah excursions and some terrible  alcohol purchases they found themselves finding an ally in the current head and 
tavern	 for the past 400  years the head of the city of ankharel known as jmon sa ord they gave the party their allegiance  in this endeavor against the conclave and presented them with a brass flute that apparently  can at least notify that the aid is required after which the party spent the evening in their  tavern after the casino incident and then went searching for this individual this mistress  asharu who apparently has the cabals ruin this next vestige in your journey upon checking in her  house after having no response for a 
none	 couple days you broke inside to find that the home had been  attacked as of a week ago her body left behind apparently riddled with puncture wounds seemingly  bullet holes after your inspection percy and cabals ruin the cloak that you were seeking is  gone and that is where we left off so diving back in youve had the information synced to you  that mistress asharrus been destroyed cabals ruin is gone you went and checked out the small  back exit that led to one of the other streets of the city essentially another way 
none	 out of the  house thats all the information you have right now and youre all trying to wrap your head  around what just happened and what the next steps are what do you want to do  laura were still in the house  matt youre still in the house yes  laura im a little nervous that the trap that went off on the front door was an alarm system  sam sure  laura for whoever left  taliesin it might be  travis with the cloak  sam or it couldve been cloakys alarm system 
dung	 that means that whoever killed cloaky got in  through not the front door  laura yeah but we saw a trail of blood leading to the front door  sam that was her trying to get out after she was stabbed to death right no  laura no i think it was the blood from  travis yeah otherwise she walked back in her individual footsteps and then laid down  sam youre right that is better detective work than mine  laura i think i mean i think that it was  sam but howd they get out 
none	 without so whoever the murderer is set the trap as heshe was  leaving  travis the murderer whos shooting bullets  liam is there anything gained by discussing this here do we need to look any further or should we  get the hell out  taliesin one last quick glance around the room to see if theres anything helpful  marisha percy can i see your gun  taliesin i hand it to her without even thinking about it  marisha i inspect  taliesin gasps youre a genius  matt make an investigation check  marisha sighs 
none	 im so bad at these  matt what are you trying to find  marisha i want to see if theres a gem or device on it like a tracking device  matt sure go for it  taliesin id be very impressed if there was  marisha oh shit 20  matt 20 you inspect the gun and the gun almost like a pearled handle in a weapon has whitestone  inlay and certain portions of the actual weapon contain pockets of whitestone upon getting closer  to it and youre perturbed as she begins to inspect closely and 
none	 you see her face open up with  reaction its probably been a while since youve missed a detail that keyleth picked up on your own  item there is a very very faint magical aura on the piece of whitestone thats underneath the main  set of barrels on the front and there is the carved signature of ripley across the bottom does  give off a faint magical glow  laura shes been fucking tracking us  liam whatre you looking at there keyleth  travis oh no  marisha i think percy was right i think she 
none	 has been spying on us  travis well scanlan throw it in the acid  laughter  sam better give me the gun  marisha wait wait wait wait i can use this if its  sam can you reverse lookup on the telephone  marisha yeah i can scry through it  taliesin you can scry  marisha and she was very attached to it which means it should work pretty well  matt in theory you can scry on anybody that youve met as well as long as you know about them  marisha ive also met her 
none	 so that helps  matt i would give that a bonus to the actual roll  travis i agree with what vax is going to say we should move  liam yeah if anyone wants to roll this place do it and lets get out of here  taliesin im going to take a quick look around quickly quickly investigation or it doesnt  matter that was a terrible roll  matt what are you looking for  taliesin clues objects im basically doing the standard police tumble im tossing the place  matt whatd you roll  taliesin i 
none	 rolled a nine  matt a nine you angrily begin throwing things around the room in a fit but youre so unfocused in  your search its less about the actual search and more about the frustration that this bypassed your  attention for so long and you guys watch as percy begins to throw the bed to the side and go through  and start shoving stuff off of counters and hes not really looking for anything hes just trying  to deal with his pentup frustration  marisha percy we should go this isnt helping anything  taliesin 
none	 yes yes yes better to do that in here than outside secret passage  liam yeah its this way i think i checked for traps last  laura because you already went up to the top  liam yeah i went all the way to the top and peeked around  matt yeah there were no traps and you managed to make it through below the small  liam i had a look around is it public or off to the side  matt its a small alley that leads into an open public space so as long as you 
none	 listen out for  anybody in the vicinity you can  liam im going to scurry up open up  matt okay go ahead and make a perception check  liam 20 no 22  matt 22 okay you go up these small handholds as you go up to the top and theres a little bit of  a grate thats pushed there you push it open and the metal circle plops on the side you find that  theres actually a piece of thin cloth thats covering it as you push it over and you listen up  for 
none	 a second you hear the bustle on the outside of the city but you do not notice anyone paying  attention to it and you use the right moment to dart up and you begin taking watch for the  rest of the party  liam im off to the side like marion in raiders to the side of the alley  laura before i leave the room can i check to see if it seems like ripley was alone or if there were  other people  matt make a survival check  laura natural 20  travis first 
none	 one of the night  matt while you guys are having this conversation vex is occasionally chiming in this whole time  but is also keeping a very close eye on her own mental layout of how the actual scuffle happened  looking for signs of impact you actually follow the footprints where someone smeared in the blood  and tracked it up there are varying foot sizes in some of the tracks you can see pressed in the  dust and there was a layer of dust down here within certain areas because portions of the room  are 
none	 not often trekked in fact you see from the general dust thats settled theres a track from  the bed to a couple of shelves to the table and the exit and you get the idea that mistress  asharru being as trained as she was she had a pattern and outside that pattern that she walked  there is a pretty heavy layer of dust that gathered in those areas of the room and those  areas had been disturbed in some ways and you gather based on the footprints that are there  there were at least five 
none	 or six people in the room when this went down  liam terminator overlay  laura all right grog  travis yeah  laura can i have some of that dust of tracelessness  travis what are you going to mix it with some spice and get high  laura definitely  travis yup here you go  laura can i sprinkle it around so that they cant track us in the room having been here  matt yeah and as you throw around the dust all the tracks everything that gave a sign of the  previous invaders vanishes 
none	 slowly as the dust begins to cover the entirety of the floor and as  you guys leave the same it looks weirdly undisturbed other than the body lying there with  now no actual ability to track how it got there  sam thats tampering with evidence thats a definite felony  laura definitely not as bad a felony as shoving spice up your ass but  sam i dont know what youre talking about that was a scientific experiment  liam it was fucking awesome are we getting out of here or are we going to get out 
town	 of here  laura yes yes yes  matt okay you all eventually make your way to the end of the secret tunnel vax leads you up at times when its  least likely to be noticed in the alleyway and eventually you all make yourselves up into the  top close off the entrance and then are hiding off and then carefully nonchalantly make your  way into the main thoroughfare up here and it isnt a large street its one of the secondary  sidestreets occasionally you have a person that comes by with a large cart or 
none	 a couple people  walking arminarm but no one seems to pay any attention or notice your alleyway entry and you  have successfully obscured yourself within the rest of the denizens of ankharel  taliesin can you find her without her knowing  marisha i mean all magic has a risk factor depending on  sam we have to look otherwise we have no leads at all  liam lets head back to the debts respite  laura and get ready to leave because we cant hang around  taliesin talk to her employer so they know it wasnt 
none	 us  sam wait wait should we not scry from a different place than the place were staying at  taliesin its the place that she knows we are already  travis true  taliesin she knows exactly where were standing anywhere were holding the bloody gun  travis and when we do we should set a little ambush in case it sets off any alarms  laura can she hear us when you scry can you hear  sam yeah you can  marisha i can hear but i dont think they can hear me its like looking through 
none	 a little  window  laura yeah so if were talking about her right now she can hear  marisha i dont know how this runic magic works on his gun  matt yeah youre not sure what the actual enchantment is its subtle  marisha this is something different than what i would be doing  liam i grab keyleths hand and pull the gun over and say but for now we assume she can hear  everything that we are saying  travis ripleys a piece of shit  laura youre a piece of shit youre ugly  
none	 liam percivals going to fucking murder you  marisha youre not that ugly she just meant that to hurt your feelings  travis keyleth dont soften the blow shes a piece of shit  marisha but you are a piece of shit  travis nice job  laughter  sam its the wire except terrible  matt omars challenge rating 30  marisha was ripley a magicuser did she ever engage in magic  taliesin not that i really was aware i didnt know her that well  sam we know that she used some magic she disguised her hand 
tavern	 with some illusion spell  taliesin nothing complex  matt she disguised her hand she also a short distance seemingly teleported or managed to break  away from you guys and trinket to make her escape  travis if shes anything like you she mightve paid someone to magically upgrade it for her  taliesin she is like me  liam shes also potentially listening to us right now i mean time is of the essence  taliesin lets head back to the tavern  matt okay you guys make your way back to the debts respite you head back 
none	 up to your rooms  and you have a relative private space to go ahead and discuss the next portion of your plan  sam do we leave the gun outside the room  taliesin we have more than one room right  matt you have three rooms  taliesin can we leave the gun with trinket in the other room  marisha i dont know if hes qualified to handle firearms  taliesin thats precisely why i want to leave the gun with trinket in the other room  laura he wont shoot it hell sit on it is 
none	 there a safety  taliesin its not loaded its all right  sam you could always put it in the bag of holding  liam i mean percival be sure theres nothing in the gun please  taliesin its so complex to make it work its fine  marisha if trinket shoots himself in the ass  taliesin it would be very funny but  laura he wont  travis what do you want to do with it now whats the plan  taliesin were going to leave it with trinket in the other room for the moment and were 
none	 going to  discuss things leaving it under the bed with a bear in the room  laura trinket sit on the bed  matt bear noises  laura if anybody walks in the room thats not one of us well make them very scared and make sure they  sam shoot them with the gun  laura laughs shoot them with the gun  matt licks the side of your face and gets back in a restful period with the front of his paws and  his head leaning over the edge of the bed and the bed itself 
none	 is bowing under his weight  laura dont you fall asleep  matt all right so you guys head to one of the other rooms then  travis yeah  matt okay you guys close the door behind you  travis should i keep watch outside  liam yeah thats a good idea  travis ill stand watch outside  matt and you do grog this hallway is yours  laura dont you fall asleep grog  travis snoring  matt all right  taliesin i think we need to tell her employer that we are not responsible as we 
none	 were the last  people to attempt to employ her suspicion automatically falls on us and we need to let them  know immediately that it was not us  liam all right should we scry now though  marisha i have to study and then sleep on it because thats how my process works  laughter  taliesin fucking method  laura okay yeah  matt you do have an item  marisha oh my god i have that thing you gave me  laura the ball yeah that i gave you  travis you have one ball  
none	 liam you have been holding out on us  laura just the one ball though  marisha i have a secret  sam vaxs face  liam its not necessarily a bad thing anything is workable stupid  taliesin bless you  marisha what is it that i got i have a little ball  laura the ball of seeing the ball of scrying  marisha scrying eye i have the scrying eye  matt there you go  sam singing scrying eyes  all singing  are watching you  sam singing they see your  matt anyone have 
none	 the item card for the  marisha i have it  matt oh you do great so yeah it allows you to basically do the equivalent of a scry spell once  per day  marisha once a day  matt yeah all right  marisha do we want to do this here  liam i think as soon as possible  taliesin i think the question is do we tell them and see if we can enlist some help with this now  or wait until after we know  sam tell who  marisha i mean this is 
none	 going to take me ten minutes this is going to take me a second  sam lets find out where she is if shes still in the city we can maybe hunt her down and track  her down today  taliesin do we get any help before we do that though from her employers  laura well talk to treev  marisha you guys figure it out im going to start scrying  taliesin figure out where shes going what shes doing how many of them all these things im  sorry  laura percy well find her  
none	 taliesin thats what im worried about  matt all right so without the gun you dont get the bonus from the item focus  marisha oh fuck  matt but you also have the gun not in your presence  marisha do we want to have the gun for this actually yeah ill do that im going to go in  the other room grab the gun and scry  laura im going to go sit with you while you scry  matt okay you go into the room and as you walk toward the bed trinket growls at you 
none	  laura trinket  taliesin i have another option i have another option we still have her notes we still have her notes  marisha does anything help  matt i mean an object of which has some close contact with the individual could help yeah  marisha sure whatever  taliesin it is her diary notes of how to build my gun  matt yeah you can use that instead if you wanted  laura so were not in the room with trinket  marisha can i use both  matt they would not overlap  marisha oh  
none	 laura trinket you keep doing your thing  matt bear noises  laura all right lets go back to the other room and lets get something else to  marisha i dont know what do you think would be better her notes or  taliesin her notes lets be safe  marisha okay im going to use her notes  matt okay that will add five to the dc modifier so whats the dc of the spell  marisha my spell save dc is 19  matt all right so now its 24 to try and resist this as i 
none	 throw my d20 into oblivion fuck that  dice i didnt need it  laura do you want one i have a bag  matt you know ill use the big one then that chris perkins gave me  travis and thus ends vox machina  matt dm power all right then this is now ripleys wisdom saving throw hm okay  travis laughs hm  liam interesting interesting  laura does that dice go to dice jail  matt no as you sit down and focus you take the small object in your hand and concentrate with the  
none	 notes in front of you and you find that thread of connection between your memory of ripley as fuzzy  in some places as it is you have a very clear image of the moments you guys met in whitestone  the notes you connect those threads focus on the object and then you guys watch as keyleths eyes  dart open once again clouded over and white your vision pierces above you can see your  consciousness thrust through the clouds white clouds passing by passing by and then your  vision comes back down through the clouds only 
none	 instead of the desert instead of the mountains  instead of anything in the nearby area its just ocean just ocean  laura shes fucking finding another one  matt waves seem endless around you  marisha oh no  matt you emerge once more your vision moving before only now theres a torrential rain  surrounding you lightning thunder clapping you are in the center of a very very heavy storm that  is tearing across this ocean expanse a boat creaks ropes swing and you hear voices yell a  crew barely holding it together standing on the 
dung	 deck hooded you see ripley calm and looking  out into the horizon she smiles from beneath her dark leather cloak a shimmer of blue energy dimly  crackling across its inner lining a voice yells nothing yet and her eyes dart up to the crows  nest then back down to her weapon a handheld firearm of slick design but familiar function  six barrels  liam oh snap  matt lightning flashes once more in the distance followed by a very very nearby crack of thunder  the boat lists for a second as a wave passes under 
town	 it and it catches itself again she runs to the  deck to look out across the crashing waves and the vision fades back  liam that was magical  travis that was hot that was hot  sam is there any ocean in town  marisha bitch she is a i grab the gun you are a piece of shit  laura i thought the gun was under the bed with trinket  taliesin youve literally just grabbed my hand and are yelling into it  marisha im sorry im still a little fuzzy when i come out of 
none	 it  sam make gun fingers at least  liam whats the matter whats the matter what did you see  marisha shes going after the other one shes in the middle of the fucking ocean  sam so shes going for the other vestige whisper is that whats in the ocean  laura whispers in the ocean the dagger fuck  marisha and she had the cloak  sam and she knows everything that we know  taliesin do you know where she is  marisha shes with a crew in the middle of the ocean so  laura 
none	 can we instantly be in the middle of the ocean with her  marisha i cant get us there theres no trees in the middle of the ocean  taliesin shes heading for an island though  laura is she  liam i thought it was beneath the waves  sam its in the ozmit sea  liam yeah beneath the ozmit sea  marisha scanlan can you get us there  sam i can make us all cows that is about it  marisha i mean i can mist us  laura mist into the ocean  marisha we 
dung	 could mist there but it would take  sam clears throat whisper blade forged from metal pulled from the far realm was center to  many dark rituals now it lies at the bottom of the ozmit sea sunken with the lost ship the shrew  in a storm 300 years ago near an island of trees  no its an island of grass theres no trees on the island  marisha no its not even an island of grass its an island of glass  sam oh glass i cant read laughs  taliesin an island of glass trees 
none	  sam an island of grass  liam ah boy  sam island of glass  marisha yeah which doesnt sound promising to be totally honest so we might have to mist there  liam how far away is  sam its continents it would take weeks  travis dont they have an airship here  marisha wait the water ashari are in the ozmit  matt theyre in the ozmit sea yes  marisha do i know if they would be close by this island of glass  matt im going to go ahead and have lets see scanlan 
none	 roll a history check and if you could  roll an intelligence check  marisha why is it always intelligence  sam ive got a 15 history  marisha oh my god i rolled a natural one  matt you know its in the ozmit sea but youve never been there you dont know where it is you  have no idea what the actual space is there  marisha we dont communicate  matt you island of glass and after thinking about it hard youre like of course its the  isle of glintshore  laura of course  
none	 matt its part of a cluster of islands you dont know quite where it is but you know of it thats  about all the information you have on it at the moment you dont know how far the specific  direction really  sam well it doesnt look like we can just magically get to her  travis ooh ooh  laura yes grog  travis arent you two dweebs always wanting to steal an airship  sam and taliesin yes  travis dont they have one here  sam and taliesin yes  travis so do i have 
town	 to say the third thing or are you going to get there  sam i would like to steal that airship but even then though it would take us a week  taliesin it would take way too much time we are on a schedule  travis what road trip bitches come on we got to like you know  sam okay lets game this out whats the worsecase scenario she has one vestige she may  have two  liam whats left after that  marisha i mean we could let her do the hard work for us  
none	 liam she has the cloak that we know of shes on top of the dagger almost  sam the spire of conflux in the abyssal plane and the plate of dawnmartyr in the elemental plane  of fire i mean those are going to be super hard to find even for her  liam i know but if were in an arms race and shes on top of another maybe we should head to  the next thats out of her reach now  travis that makes sense  marisha the staff is in the plane of the abyss  
none	 laura thats a very scary place  travis the only problem with that is she only has one now and if she has two she might be a bit  harder  laura especially imagine if one of us was wearing all of the vestiges  sam she has people working for her clearly  laura shes not going to give it up  sam no but i mean it wont be her alone  liam and were not going to get there in time to stop her from getting that dagger  taliesin but we might be able to 
none	 take them from her and perhaps even finally put her down before  she puts more of those bloody things into the world  marisha can i also ask another question percy  taliesin sure  marisha why does she want these vestiges in the first place i have a feeling she doesnt want to  fight dragons  sam she might want to join up with the dragons  marisha do you know  taliesin i dont  liam i mean theres many reasons to amass power  laura could she be the one letting the dragons know about 
none	 could she be the spy  taliesin i spent less than a week in her company in my life i know very little about her other  than i spent a week in her company and i spent i dont know how much time trying to track her down  and all i really know is shes very smart and she is the worst person ive ever met  marisha why would you say that exactly because weve met a lot of terrible people  sam kevdak  taliesin people dont frighten me  marisha their dad  taliesin he 
none	 doesnt frighten me  marisha saundor was pretty shitty clarota  sam well lets not rank the bad people weve met  taliesin i dont even know if she wants anything maybe she wants nothing  travis are you genuinely afraid of her  taliesin yes very much so  travis oh  laura fuck why didnt we kill her when we had her in our  sam she got away we tried  taliesin i made a terrible trade i made the wrong trade and i made a terrible decision i know that  laughter  taliesin the table 
none	 on the left is completely incapable  travis the player on your right  liam a little mug interference  taliesin let me get this enchantment off my gun lets find somebody who can pull it off and put it  onto something else and leave it here and then lets run screaming to this island and see if we  can catch her and if shes not there we spend 24 hours where i will recount every desperate attempt  i have made to try and kill her in the last few years of my life and then we 
none	 head back and deal  with the other monstrosities that are waiting for us back home  sam i dont know that well get there in time  liam how do we get there  marisha we had to fly across the ozmit sea to get to marquet  matt it took you about a week to get to vasselheim via skyship from emon and thats  normally a twoandahalf week journey by boat you guys got to marquet via your transport via  plants oh no sorry you got to marquet via the teleportation circle that  marisha gilmore 
none	 made for us  laura are we by the ocean at all  marisha but the oceans above us right  matt you have a mountain range that is at the top the northern part of the desert probably a  day and a half of foot travel and the mountain range youre not sure how big that is from what  you know of loose geography scanlan you probably know this better than anybody that  ankharel and this part of the desert is not too far from the northern shore of marquet compared  to the rest of 
none	 it the entire continent is like a big u and this is the ozmit sea up here this is  marquet ankharels right there and then this is the ocean  laura can misty step travel faster than a boat  matt of an ocean boat yes probably twice as fast  laura so if it took her a week to get where she is now we could probably get there  taliesin in three days but where do you rest in the  sam yes wed have to rest in order to do misty step  liam if your 
none	 magic runs out while were flying over the ocean what happens we drown  laura we dont necessarily drown immediately  taliesin also if we can find a way to teleport to the island if theres a way that we can  liam but how  sam we have one teleportation circle  marisha i mean i could teleport us  liam you have to have a circle to a circle  marisha i could teleport us to the edge of the continent we could sleep and then misty step  lasts eight hours  matt yeah wind walk you 
none	 mean  marisha wind walk whatever  matt its a different spell but yeah its 30 feet  liam that wouldnt do it  matt little different  marisha wind walk lasts eight hours  sam shes on a boat shes not on a magic boat she cant magically get back to the shore without  sailing there if we sail out on an airship or a boat  laura we could bomb her  sam well yes shes slow moving shes on a boat itll take her days to get wherever shes going  we need to find her 
none	 and we can keep scrying on the airship and catch up to her slowly shes a  slow moving target even after she  liam i like that youre assuming well have an airship  sam we dont right now but we will soon  marisha it could take us a while to even get the airship  sam nope one day me and percy maybe two hours  travis i actually agree with that strategy it is a bit like fish in a barrel because she is limited  by her speed  laura will we be able to 
none	 find her in the middle of the ocean  sam we can keep scrying from the airship  liam thats true  taliesin we can keep scrying  taliesin the first thing we have to do is remove this enchantment and im very open to ideas on how  to do that  travis wait but play it out how do we see where she is in comparison to a giant body of water  sam well we use what sailors do  travis look up at the stars  sam up at the stars right we scry at night 
none	  travis were looking at her right not up can we like go like that  laura no you can scry up yeah  matt focused around the target of the scrying  liam are either of you gentlemen smart enough to do that  marisha we cant tilt the camera up a little bit  matt no you can but youll see a blurred skyline  sam we can listen for clues maybe the crew members will shout out a oh were at longitude  blah blah blah latitude blah blah blah  matt for you when you scry 
none	 on something imagine it like super high depth of field so like what  youre looking at is super infocus and most everything else is very blurred and out of focus  sam okay wait to play this out a bit more we know where shes going we know where glintshore  is roughly if we got a local  liam do you know where that island is  sam well we can find a local who does a sailor or something who can help us navigate our way there  laura maybe somebody in an airship  travis we 
none	 could but we might just be chasing as long as were all right with that well just be  chasing  laura well keep scrying until we see if shes found it  taliesin until we see a tree  travis vax does have a point though if were just chasing we could get the jump on other ones  taliesin heres the terrifying notion if you see a tree in any of your scries can you teleport to it  marisha yes i can  taliesin so as long as she gets next to a tree  sam i 
none	 dont think shes getting next to a tree  marisha shes in the middle of the ocean  taliesin once shes on the island if the island has a tree  laura and liam its possible  sam it was near it was near the island of glass  taliesin were going to be looking for her thats where i would set up shop if i were  liam i mean percival is correct the first thing we have to do is get that gun unfucked but then  after we have to decide if we are chasing her down 
none	 and it seems 5050 to me not impossible  but not a sure thing at all or do we head to the next vestige to keep it out of her hands  laura into the plane of abyss  liam well isnt that where we have to go anyway  travis lets get the gun unfucked and well simmer on it  sam wait before we get the gun unfucked is there any use to it being fucked like can we  have playacting conversations around it like oh this is where we should go next hope youre  listening 
none	  taliesin that is deeply assuming that it actually conveys sound which it may not  marisha yeah we have no idea what it actually is lets go get it  taliesin yeah were going to have to move that enchantment onto something else  sam we can go to that place where back to the asshole  taliesin i know what he wants no  sam what does he want  laura he wants whitestone  sam so give him whitestone  taliesin absolutely not  marisha hes going to take one really close look at that gun and 
none	 see a lot of whitestone in it  travis i got two chunks of whitestone in the bag of holding  taliesin he wants the green gems and im not prepared to make that deal  sam we can make him a fake one and give it to him for one favor we can make a fake gem how hard is that  laura hes going to know  travis i got a bunch of gems in the bag of holding  taliesin its not going to work  laura do you have green gems  travis gems lots of 
none	 gems  laura no but the green gems from whitestone  liam whitestone is much further away from the ozmit sea than where we are now right  matt whitestone is much further away yes  liam way way other side of the continent right  matt across a vast ocean and then across the continent  sam one thing that occurred to me that may not help us at all mistress asharru the dead girl  she was part of an organization  taliesin yes  sam maybe they would want to help us because of revenge  taliesin 
town	 heres the question and this is what ive been thinking about sitting here for the last  few minutes is either way this is terrible either we dont tell them and leave town and  eventually they find her and shes got strange holes in her from some strange thing that could  possibly be a thing that a man with white hair who breezed through town a week ago was holding or we  go and tell them and i cannot believe this is about to come out of my mouth that it wasnt me  it was a 
none	 one armed woman who had  sam a fugitive  taliesin an identical thank you weapon of this one of a kind weapon that no one bloody saw  laura no but heres the thing maybe somebody did see her  taliesin maybe somebody did see her and maybe theyll know where to get the gun  marisha even if they did see her we know she knows how to alter her appearance also no  offense percy but i feel like we need to be careful on who you expose that gun to from here  on out  
none	 taliesin i am keenly aware  marisha not only one for people who might think youre the culprit but two for people who are  going to want to rip you off again  taliesin shes the only person whos ever gotten a good look at it shes the only one  sam so other than chasing her going for the next vestige on the list the third option is wish her  good luck and continue on with our mission ignoring the fact that she exists  marisha maybe shell die in the ozmit sea  taliesin she wont 
none	  liam how longs it been since we left draconia  matt five days  laura not five days  matt from your travel from draconia back to whitestone to resting in whitestone heading from  there to the southern city then travelling from there to ankharel then youve had  taliesin a lot of that was instantaneous we did camp three or four days  matt well no yeah about four or five days because you travelled then from whitestone to  south of ankharel then you wind walked to ankharel but then camped outside of ankharel  because 
none	 the time you got there was night then you made it into the city then you stayed for the  evening you slept again and the next night you went ahead and went into the casino then slept  the night there so yeah its been about five days  marisha is it like a flying from east to west thing where we gain back a day when we go back  matt no  laura but we dont have to fly we just have to teleport there  taliesin so long as we teleport were fine  laura but 
none	 we dont have a plan we have five days to figure out how to fucking kill a dragon oh jesus  marisha and we didnt get the vestige we came here for so  taliesin no we did not in fact its worse  matt well two weeks was the agreement so you have more than five nine  liam you can do anything in nine days  travis we dont even have to keep the agreement come on  laura potentially  travis just saying we getting the gun unfucked or what  taliesin lets go downstairs and talk 
tavern	 to her employer  laura treev  matt treev yes all right  taliesin im going to leave the gun upstairs still  marisha wait what dont we need it to tap the gun to  sam well we got to find out whos going to unfuck it  laura is treev downstairs  matt all right you head down into the tavern and at this time of day its a little empty a  little sparse maybe like four patrons two in discussions one thats deep in the cups and one  in the midst of going through paperwork 
none	 and in the far back you see treev once again has his heavy  spectacles on and is currently looking through that same book he was before doesnt seem to pay  any mind to you until you approach him  laura treev  matt oh aye good to see you what can i do for you  laura we need to talk to you its rather urgent  matt then talk to me puts his book away glasses on it leans forward  taliesin theres been a complication the mistress is shes been assassinated  marisha we hadnt heard 
tavern	 anything in these past few days we decided to pay her a call  matt he leans forward a little bit on the bar vex vax and keyleth you notice that the hooded  figure that originally delivered the note is back in the far corner where it was and it seems  to have stepped a couple inches out of the shadows as well paying very close attention to this  conversation  taliesin did we bring the note with us good  matt goes so you are saying that the mistress was assassinated  taliesin and the cloak 
none	 stolen  matt cloak  taliesin the cloak she wore  matt and you know this how  laura we found her body  matt where  laura in her home  scanlan dont think that was her home  marisha in her hideout  taliesin in her room beneath the house  matt how do you know where she lived  taliesin we are very clever but not clever enough to stop this this appears to have happened  possibly before we even we dont know when it happened it happened a while ago  laura about a week 
tavern	 ago i think  matt percy make a persuasion check  taliesin 13  matt okay treev puts one hand out on the bar hes got a big heavy coin in it hes nervously  tapping it few knocks on wood  taliesin we think we know who did it in fact we are near positive we know who did it  matt you hear door closing as the door of the tavern closes and all the patrons you saw are now  standing up completely sober and theyre all taking a circle to the outside of your group hes 
town	  leaning forward going all right so youre clever you came looking for the mistress she  suddenly winds up dead you found her body  taliesin and we tell you this as opposed to leaving  laura we had nothing to do with it we couldve left town  marisha clearly we know how this looks which is why we came to you first  taliesin we are desperate in finding who did this  liam whats the hooded figure doing right now  matt still sitting in the back of that shadowed alcove between a bunch of barrels 
tavern	 that are stacked  and part of the bar side  liam im going to keep focused there  travis is he still tapping the coin  matt no the coin tapping has stopped  marisha and what are the people around us doing are they like drawing their weapons  matt no  marisha do they seem armed  matt do you take a look around  marisha i want to just glance  travis i take a very blatant look around  matt okay none of them appear to be armed but theyre all looking very closely upon 
none	 you you can  make a perception check keyleth and grog if youd like  travis 13  marisha not bad  travis there is a ceiling  marisha straight perception 25  matt okay yeah you see them staring they look pretty normal  travis they look pretty  matt you do notice what you didnt quite notice before when you first entered but a lot of these  tables have like small cubbies on the edges and each one of them are standing very close to one  one you see a little bit of a pommel that 
tavern	 is barely poking out and theyre all at the  ready this tavern definitely is mercenary band uses this tavern as their base of operation and has  definitely seemingly outfitted it to be functionally good place for mercenaries when they need to be  marisha i look down in front of me is there any hidden cubbies in the table that we are at  matt that you are at  marisha yeah  matt you have to get down to really inspect you want to do that  marisha no  matt okay at initial glance you dont 
none	 see anything because everything is close to you its  from a topdown perspective and youre blocked from seeing anything beneath  taliesin for what its worth we will not draw first we want to find her have any of your  people seen a woman with one metal arm shes so dangerous and now so much more dangerous  matt he goes ahead and puts his finger up this way and marks this direction the figure that  youre watching vax steps out from the shadow and walks very calmly across the room through all of  you right 
tavern	 to the edge of the bar by the door and goes not breaking eye contact with you speaks  out of the side of his mouth treev goes go ahead and check their story see her abode were  all going to wait here nice and patiently together until we figure out what the fuck is going on  travis makes sense do you have any mead  matt we got mead  taliesin in the meantime id like to at least to start to tell you what we need next for when our  story is confirmed  matt 
none	 well youve certainly got a captive audience so go ahead  taliesin this woman has been tracking us she placed a mystical tracker upon us at some point  weve just discovered it and we need to find a way to move it away and put it somewhere she does not  suspect that we know that she placed it and does not see us coming when its time for us to kill her  matt so youre saying this woman that youre chasing is the one that killed the mistress  taliesin yes we believe so  laura your 
none	 mistress has had a very powerful item on her its why we sought her out as well  matt more so blindedsided at the idea that the mistress was felled by someone she could take  care of herself and has for quite some time  laura from what i could see her attackers were not alone there were five of them  liam they had an unfair advantage  matt five of them and a woman you say his eyes narrow for a second describe this woman  sam she disguises her appearance so how we know her might 
none	 not be how you have seen her she has  sometimes shown herself as an old woman  matt old woman and he starts describing sort of a spindly grayblonde hair tumbles past the  shoulders piercing blueish green eyes  taliesin always piercing eyes  sam did she come through here  matt she was the last one to hire the mistress about a week before you came  taliesin sighs heavily  sam what was the job  matt i dont know  sam and she had some fellows traveling with her  matt she had five individuals 
tavern	 following her aye  marisha what did they look like  matt didnt get the best good look kept it very hushhush between me and the lady at the table  rest of them stayed at the back of the bar then they went on their business  sam where were they staying  matt here  sam in our rooms  matt aye  sam that gives me the heebiejeebies  taliesin that does not make me feel good she is so dangerous  marisha how was she a full week ahead of us  laura oh shit treev 
none	  sam because we went to draconia  laura i put dust of tracelessness on the ground in her home  matt whats that mean  taliesin its going to obfuscate any of the scuffle theyre only going to find a body with  holes in it  matt so youre telling me that you came in here with a story about a murder of one of my finest mercs  taliesin yes  matt and you decided upon finding this murder to get rid of all the evidence of said murder and  anything that could possibly point to 
none	 you not being the murderers  taliesin i did point this out to everybody before we came down here but at the moment we were a  little bit thrown by the dead woman  matt im not going to lie i mean as far as  liam why would we come directly to you if that were the case why wouldnt we have not just left  laura plus you know what  taliesin they will be able to tell the body is at least a week old  laura exactly your man has seen a dead body before 
tavern	 hes going to be able to tell that its  been there for a while  marisha im sure you have a cleric in the circle talk to her firsthand if you have to  liam im curious if you can imagine a reason why we would come to you with this rather than sneak  away in the night  travis yeah im just curious how much the mead is  matt on the house he reaches under the bar and pulls up one thick dark red ceramic bottle  caps already off hes plucked it off with his 
tavern	 thumb and sets it in front of you  travis my thanks  taliesin im so sorry  matt guess its possibly one of the major setbacks of this line of business very few grow  too old and gray and get to die happy in their beds god knows i wasnt planning to theres a long  awkward pause interspersed with bits of conversation for about 15 minutes before the  hooded figure returns enters the door comes over and whispers for a good solid minute in the ear of  treev before stepping back and calmly walking back 
town	 to its corner treev sits up well parts of  your story certainly hold up the body has been there for a while at least from before i saw you  mind you i dont know when you came into town we only met a few days ago  taliesin if we were smart enough to take care of her and smart enough to pull all of this off this  would be a ridiculous move  laura laughs that we would come to hire her after we had already  marisha killed her  taliesin i would beg you 
none	 to explain why were having this conversation  matt oh believe me a lot of you doesnt make sense period so im just trying to figure it all  out and he rubs the end of his long draconian snout  taliesin the woman in question helped murder my entire family took great pleasure and delight in  it i have been tracking her for years  matt what you plan to do when you find her then  taliesin kill her thats all ive lost my taste for anything beyond that but she is dangerous and  she is 
none	 evil  liam in this moment everyone in this room wants the same thing  marisha we didnt come to you because we necessarily needed to go through the proper  channels we did it because we were trying to be forthcoming clearly you are all a talented bunch  so are we  taliesin my feelings for her have become very complex i dont care who kills her at this point  she just needs to be removed from the earth  matt which one of you is your dealmaker  liam i boot scanlan forward on the tush 
tavern	  sam hello hi  matt this one  sam i make the best deals i know the best words  matt this one  sam sometimes its vex but many times its me  matt he leans over the bar and gets real close up to you and takes a moment to sniffs aye you  smell like trouble i like that make a persuasion check  sam what am i persuading him to do  matt this is your essence of presence and telling him that youre the kind of person that  sam oh my general charm 
none	  matt your general charm  taliesin i dont know what hes wearing but its very nice  sam persuasion you say 29  matt how is this for a deal i got a nice fine look at your faces i got friends all across these  lands if what you say is true you go we let you leave you find this murdering bitch you kill  her i want one thing her good hand i think that would be vengeance enough for the mistress  marisha i mean we dont have any use for it  taliesin i 
none	 feel very good about that deal  liam good terms  matt not talking to you im talking to you  sam thats lovely but we cant find her without some assistance  matt well youve come to the right place what assistance do i have to give you what do you need  sam we need to get this curse off of the thing that found your assassin  matt cant really help you with that sorry mate  sam dont have any magic wielders among you  matt weve got scattered mercs throughout the city aye but they 
none	 work for coin and half of  them are busy in other jobs  liam we have coin  matt how much you got  liam what do we got  travis enough  taliesin let us know what it takes money is money and we have a long way to go and a lot to  deal with but we are happy to pay for the work that is done  matt all right i can call someone in  sam we also may need some naval assistance  laura specifically an airship of sorts  taliesin or transportation 
none	 shes heading shes on a boat shes heading north to the island of  travis glintshore  marisha or you know even if you know of any trees big trees  matt he goes hmm ships no not much in the way of ships here in the middle of a desert youre  looking for them skybuggers looking for a ship like that for seafaring types youre going to want  to go past the agrin mountains then make your way towards the bay of gifts  marisha and taliesin bay of gifts  matt thats where youll find the 
town	 port town of shamal  marisha port town of shamal  matt shamal the mountain range is vast in itself youre looking at oh at least a week on  foot to try and traverse those mountains  liam did you say bay of gifs  sam bay of jifs its pronounced  matt im going to fucking fuck you  laughter  taliesin its a local joke im so sorry  marisha the port of shamal  sam there is a skyport near here is that true  matt aye its over by the  sam controlled by the 
none	 local government  matt theres no one fucking controls the skyport  taliesin were not asking you we have other friends as well  matt well if youre looking for speed its probably your best bet ships on this ocean lets  say the weathers not usually handy  taliesin we are looking for speed and a crazy captain  matt well wish you the best of luck  laura thank you  matt now go kill her give me her hand i figure if time goes by and i havent heard from  you youve either died or ill 
town	 be sending some of our mercs to come find you  liam yeah but the magic thing with the gun  sam how long would it take to get this person who can remove a curse  taliesin or if you were going to go do something like this who would you find in town  matt if youre looking for fast speedy and immediate assistance with this well thats going  to have to run the cost up a bit see we have quite an enchanter that could probably help you  with that  laura oh really  
none	 matt aye see if in the next hour i could bring him in but itll run you full disillusion or  whatever you need 750 gold  taliesin not full disillusion how about a transference  matt transference  taliesin to move the enchantment to another object  matt well takes  laura its a much easier enchantment  matt moving something takes a little bit longer than to just get rid of something  taliesin how much longer  matt i dunno not one of them types but i mean weve had a couple of enchantments moved in the 
none	  past and that was anywhere from a few days to a few weeks get that done  marisha why dont we call them in and have them look at it  matt all right  sam 750 do we have that to spare  travis yes  taliesin thats worth its weight  matt 750  laura 750 or if you have a need of gems we have gems  liam you dont get fast and cheap  taliesin i know  sam are you a gem lover  matt i carry a bit of jewelry on occasion  
none	 sam i like you what do we have  laura so many things you should call your enchanter  matt all right and he goes ahead and pulls out a small tome of blank sheets many you see have  been torn out and he makes a quick note on one rolls it up very simply doesnt do the usual  rigmarole of an official writ but hands it to the masked hooded figure in the corner who walks out  and darts off kymell be here in a hour  laura an hour  sam kine  matt kyme 
none	  laura kynan  liam sorry that rang a bell sorry  matt payment  laura payment  sam up front wow  laura but we dont even know what hes doing yet  matt do you trust in my service  laura of course i dont know what were going to have him do thats all  matt well if youd much rather we could go ahead and clean out your guts here in the floor  wouldnt be the first time i had to swab the floors here  laura how about these two beautiful sapphires theyre quite 
tavern	 lovely  matt all right  laura and and i pull out a giant raw ruby as well  matt he knocks the countertop and gestures for you to put them down he looks over at one of the  guys in the bar theyve all relaxed a bit now two of them have sat down one of them approaches  human a little scruffy looks like hes a little ill to be honest like hes probably not had a  good week of food he however walks up and fumbles through a small pouch and pulls out a  
none	 small jewelers eyepiece and takes them up and inspects each of them independently how much are  they worth  laura 200 each for the sapphires and the ruby is 150  sam jesus laura  laura its only a hundred gold short  matt id take it sits back down very well debt is paid takes the gems pops them in his  little side pouch do you guys wait for the hour  taliesin i was going to say if somebody wants to go booking passage on an airship my personal  feeling is that grog and scanlan 
none	 would be the people to send on such an adventure  sam grog i mean yes grog would be good at that yes lets do that  taliesin im only saying grog because then they know what theyre getting into  sam i like that idea  travis are you trying to get me out of the room  taliesin no well yes would you rather sit for an hour in here or would you rather go outside and  talk to somebody about a giant flying boat  travis the last one  liam perfect its like hannibal and 
none	 mr t together thats what you want  taliesin i dont know thats my opinion personally unless anybody else  travis just call me baracus lets go  sam all right well go  taliesin our friends are going to arrange travel for us the rest of us are going to stay here is  that appropriate  matt certainly sit ill get you some food so is it going to be just you two  sam i guess were going to go try to find an airship  travis yeah twins schwarzenegger and devito at it again  laughter 
none	  taliesin julius my god  sam which ones which  liam vincent you are my twin  taliesin im pregnant vincent oh wrong one sorry i always thought it was the same guy in my  head its a sequel  matt all right so as the rest of you guys stay behind you get a fair meal the two of you begin  making your way through ankharel youre making your way over towards the edge of the suncut  bazaar towards the sand herald district right on that cusp there is where you saw the skyport in 
town	  the distance go ahead and make an investigation check you can make one as well grog  sam 25  travis 17  matt all right where normally it would be confusing to find where the base of it is as it is  obfuscated by a series of other larger buildings you guys ask a couple of folks rather quickly that  know the layout of the town really well and with enough of a flash of a smile and a flash of a  really intense arm muscle within the next 30 minutes or so find yourself 
none	 at the base of the  actual skyport it is called the indala skyport  sam sings indala  matt not as tall as the one in emon which lays on the outskirts of the cloudtop district but it  appears to be on the level its maybe a good five stories up the outside of it is a similar  chain lifted platform as the tower at the cerulean palace that you guys traversed earlier in your  time in ankharel there is a large stone scaffold with no walls sitting there on the ground as you  approach 
none	 there are two people dressed in simple clothing you see some dust and dirt on their  hands theyre in the midst of moving crates up and down and you see theyre moving some barrels  off of the platform putting them up onto a cart thats probably going to be wheeled deeper into  the city as you approach the platform you see one of them is by a bell mechanism attached to part  of the platform a small block thats about shoulder high and theres a bell on the end of it  with a ringer  
none	 travis wait before we ring indala have you ever rented a skyship before  sam no i have no idea what were doing here  travis oh really  sam i mean i assume were trying to find out how much it costs for a seven day rental including a  pilot or two  travis so were doing this like the straight and narrow way  sam were getting the information probably come back and steal it  travis ooh okay ill be quiet you talk  sam okay well youre pretty good at this too  travis yeah 
none	 well singing indala indala  liam help help its happening  taliesin help help its actually happening  travis do you mind if i ring the bell  sam yeah go for it  travis can i ring the fucking shit out of that bell  matt as you step up onto the stone platform both of you the two guys that are working the guy  keeps putting the barrels theres like two or three on the side there and he goes ahead and  sets one of the three up staring at you as you approach the other 
none	 guy is to the side goes can  i help you as you walk past and turn back and smile and bell ringing start ringing the crap  out of it make a strength check  travis aww no oh thats not too bad 13  matt 13 okay you have enough control over your physical brawn as to not snap or destroy the bell  however what happens is after you ring the bell for a few seconds the guy goes wait no and  before anything else happens the chains that were slack tighten up and the platform 
none	 begins to lift  up the guy who had two barrels left on the platform still is like no wait and goes over  and tries to grab one of the barrels as it tumbles off and breaks on the ground next to him  yelling in marquesian and is raising his fists  sam were on an elevator  matt yeah and its now lifting up and its about 1520 feet off the ground and its going up to the  top the bell seemed to have notified whatever crew is bringing the platform up but he didnt  
none	 get a chance to finish bringing his load off the platform before you rung the bell  travis i think were doing it right  sam i think so  matt as you leave the two gentlemen below as the two of you lift up on this platform you make your  way up to the elevated terrace that marks the actual skyport and its a large wide thick  platform thats built atop a series of warehouses that fill out this district and this was a newer  addition to it as this technology became available go ahead and 
none	 roll a history check  sam natural 20  travis wow  sam love me some airships  matt actually skyships originated in ankharel this is where the crystals that hold them aloft  are enchanted there have been other ships there are different designs that are constructed in  different towns you do know that there is no skyship transport to wildemount and that was part  of the reason why the sovereign uriel was trying to make that deal with the briarwoods under the  idea that it would open trade with wildemount its pretty insular locked off 
none	 from the larger  countries here that work together the skyport here is probably the first skyport that was built  and this is the origin of that tech as you come to the very top of the platform  it eventually stops and you see one gentleman there whos essentially working this  large crank that brings the platform up and it has a series of thick chains that wind on themselves  as soon as he finishes and you guys get to the top he turns what yes what hello  travis meepmeep  sam be pleased we 
none	 are here to inquire about some business if you dont mind  matt he points that way and you guys look right and the rest of this terrace for the record  there are two skyships that are currently docked here at the moment one that has a very nice  thick heavy design it has beautiful gems encrusted in the side and theres brass and gold  inlay that twists into this turquoise transition to the bottom its a beautiful ship you can see  theres a crew of about 12 that are currently loading things onto it right 
none	 now theres a big  cranelike apparatus similar to what you had in emon that is currently putting things onto the  ship it looks like its being heavily loaded for transport somewhere theres another ship it  looks familiar its actually very similar to the emon designs that you guys saw at the skyports  over there that appears to be by about six heavy  chains locked to the opposite side of this skyport and doesnt  seem to have any apparent hustle bustle of crew around its a little bit smaller than the more  intricate design 
none	 the one that has all the work around it does match some of the design aesthetic  of some of the higher end areas of ankharel so that you probably imagine it was one of the  original skyships that was built here the other one you saw has the small fins on the side  similar to the one you rode across to vasselheim you do also notice that there are about six hands  of ord scattered across the terrace in full armor that are basically keeping an eye out and watching  everything making sure that no 
none	 bullshit goes down you do see a small building thats in the  center of this terrace that maybe has about three or four different rooms apparently the  individual who was overseeing this entire process with the one big ship is walking back and forth  between with instructions to the foreman whos yelling out to the crewmen who are loading up this  big ship thatll probably be the place to go to inquire  sam okay we go over there  matt all right as you walk in  sam we die  matt suffer a horrible 
none	 stroke and fall to the ground scanlan is no more  travis green dragon unveils herself and we die  liam my barrels dragon roaring noise  travis shit literally in the last place we would have looked  matt so as you walk into the room its fairly quiet there appears to be a clerk office there  with a bunch of ledgers stacked up and you can see a layout of a number of days with notes  scrawled in a language that you dont recognize there are a couple of small clockwork timepieces  that are against 
none	 the walls there and you see a younger woman probably mid20s but going gray a  little early all on one side of her head who is currently going through one of these books she  has a quill between her teeth right now shes thumbing through the pages looks up can i help  you takes the quill out sets it down  sam hello be pleased beep beep my associate and i would like to inquire about renting an  airship  matt renting an airship  sam chartering it for a trip  matt okay well for 
none	 now lets see ship vusin is already chartered and is loading up to be  heading northward towards issylra that is not available the other one which is the deera has  been docked for about four weeks without use so you could go inquire with the captain there  sam is that the crappier one or the better one  matt its the smaller one  sam okay so we would charter from the captain themself not from you  matt well the captain would pay us a cut based on what the destination is  sam so i 
none	 can do my homework how much do you think a weeks charter would run on an airship  matt that is for you to negotiate with the captain  travis yes is there any way to book passage on the ship thats already moving northward  sam as passengers  matt that is not a passengerbased ship unfortunately that is actually working for one of  the guilds it is paid for use of their mercantile only  sam okay  travis how fast is that smaller ship  matt unloaded pretty quick the cargo can load down ships  
none	 travis hmm yes  matt depends on how fast you wish to go and where you are going may i ask where you are  planning to charter this to  sam our mission is a bit of a hushhush one we better not disclose that  travis yeah we are going to an ocean  matt perhaps it is best that we negotiate the price here than as opposed to with the captain  sam yes that would be preferable for sure  travis wait why whos the captain  matt she stands up and walks over to one 
none	 of the small windows that leads out to the terrace and  you can see another bell thats out there and she grabs the edge bell ringing on the bell goes  back to her seat im calling the captain hell be here a few minutes pass in the distance out  the window you can see a small rope ladder drops and a figure makes their way over and walks in  inside in goldtrimmed armor is a familiar sight this is captain damon the guy who actually  brought you guys across the ozmit sea  sam its 
none	 our guy damon  marisha are there not that many pilots in the world  matt there arent a lot of skyships you would know theres probably six in commission  sam how fast did this one make the kessel run  matt it was a week across the entire ozmit sea that was with some cargo on board so it wasnt  very slow it would have taken a normal ship two and a half weeks  sam does damon recognize us  matt as he walks in he goes yes are we ready to  marisha wyverns attacked

none	 voice in the back also consider that in the negotiation  sam but also consider this we are on a mission thats very important to the security of both  marquet and other continents and we have friends in high places and i will flash our little badge  travis yes  sam the badge that jmon sa ord gave us  liam not your fake little star from preshow  matt he looks down and he goes that looks very pretty  travis oh this is given from jmon sa ord  matt i dont know who that is

none	 waters below  matt the captain says actually weve got an individual just for that he looks back to the  clerk are you sure yes its fine not a worry well talk when they leave  travis dont mind me but i have violence on the mind at all times is there any customary weaponry  or defense that you can put on this airship during our travels just in case we run into the same  shit we did last time  matt the captain goes actually after the encounter we had over the ozmit last time i 
none	  managed to outfit this ship with a brand new series of dragon arbalests so this is going to be  a welldefended journey  travis nice do they aim in all directions  matt youll see  travis nice  matt and you do recall seeing them when you were in vasselheim you saw them being brought down and  installed on the ship but that was last time you saw the ship  sam can the ship be prepared to leave tomorrow morning  matt we can leave in the next hour if you want  travis stand

none	 possible  matt all right ill assemble the crew and well be ready within the hour  sam excellent  travis how many of your crew will you have with you just ballpark it  matt it would be a crew of eight normally seven but we have eight now  travis and im sure this crew is your finest no greenhorns men youve spent years with trust  your life with  matt most of them yes  travis most of them how many do you not trust your life with  matt there is one weve had on

none	  sam 23  matt 23 scanning through you find the odd four copper pieces you find a couple of small books  one looks like its on etiquette and the other is written in a language you dont understand but  you gather its marquesian you do also find some small notes like a little name that is drawn on  the inside of one of the drawers looks old like its been there for a long time and says lelan  and you find thats about it you get the sense this isnt a stationary room that they 
none	 use as a  base of operations its almost like a rental space used when people want to come in here and do  business which happens often in a casino establishment they want to make sure that they  provide their clientele with all the necessary needs and a lot of the rooms on this center floor  are to facilitate the meetings between the top and the bottom  sam damn it all right ill do one more investigation check to see if theres any hidden  compartments in the desk or around it  travis burn it 
none	 to the ground  sam 24  matt 24 nothing under the desks but the table that youre at there is a small false bottom on  each side you pull it open and there is a single dagger on each end apparently for those that  know theyre provided as a means of defense in case things in one of these meetings go wrong but  who knows who knows this information it looks like they havent been used in a while  sam all right  travis can i look around and see if i see the two 
none	 faces now  matt sure make another perception check  travis 18  matt nope  sam all right fine i will take the daggers take the marquesian book whatever that was take  a huge dump on the desk and take one of the daggers and dig a big piece of it and write on the  wall the meat man cometh  laughing  taliesin wouldnt it be the meat man goeth oh well never mind  sam and then ill let myself out  matt okay you open the door there are two people walking through they

none	 he goes  sam i cant even get slapped in the face right  taliesin i will ruin everything i will ruin everything  matt its a valid point thank you for remembering  travis i was so confused why a stranger would ask me to slap him  laughter  sam we go home  liam wait so way faster than the casino trip while weve been waiting so long percival has  been acting fucking twitchy since we found that body so i walk over to him sitting off at a table  hey mr coolasacucumber shush or 
none	 come with me come have a seat  laura okay all right im here  liam whats the matter yeah its her again were going to find her its fine youre huffing  and hawing since we found her body its fine whats going on  taliesin i was really hoping she was going to go away thats all i was really hoping that she was  just going to go away  liam well shes going to go away percival if not now later  taliesin every second shes alive is untold damage to the world do you know 
none	 how every now and  then i say something awful  laura mmhmm  taliesin i love you both very much for that when i think of that terrible person inside of me i see  her face she has a very active imagination she knows how to make these machines and her  imagination terrifies me if you knew that that was me would you let me live has she made ten  more of these things has she made 100 does she hand them out to people maybe i dont know  maybe shes running around and torturing 
none	 peoples parents and siblings to death and then handing  them a gun and kicking them out into the world to see what will happen because it could be funny  liam youre probably right percival she probably is this is not lord and lady briarwood  over again though  taliesin no its not  liam and youre not alone  taliesin no im not  liam you have me you have her you have her you have the other two laurel and hardy motherfuckers  who arent back yet  taliesin i was so hoping that maybe  
none	 marisha i slam some mead in front of him  taliesin thank you i was hoping something heavy had fallen on her from a great height saving the  world a few thousand lives  laura well were going to be above her maybe we can be the one to drop something heavy  taliesin thats really what im hoping  marisha oh ive been practicing that actually i can be really heavy  taliesin that may help  marisha yeah  taliesin she is the biggest mistake ive made and im horrified by whos paid the price  liam 
none	 all the more reason for you to be the same coldhearted asshole youve been for the last  year why change now get the job done percival  taliesin im counting to a hundred ill be fine  marisha its not very often we see you shaky percy  taliesin once were out of here ill feel fine once that thing is off my machine i will feel  fine and im thinking of something else im thinking of building something awful to help deal  with her  marisha hang on wait hang on i was about to ask 
none	 if you ever have regrets of building something  awful and releasing it into this world and now you just said youre going to double down  essentially  taliesin ive been thinking long and hard about it i think inevitably anytime i think of  something it might be too late i think im going to be very careful about what i build im going  to be very careful about where it goes and im also going to ask anybody if when i die destroy  everything please this is why i dont write down notes any of 
none	 my sketches theyre put away and  theyre put in a place where i can remove them once the job is done but i sketch my idle  thoughts and right now im having an idle thought for her and its simple its nothing complicated  its just vicious  liam well all right we can do that we can destroy anything you make but for now percy  keep your head man  taliesin one night of sleep ill be there  marisha what exactly are you thinking of making just because we could destroy your notes i mean 
none	  youre still alive and your guns still got into the world  laura regardless of what he makes who wields it fenthras is a horrible weapon wielded by a  horrible being before i had it a gun can do the same thing  marisha youre arguably one of the greatest minds in existence right now percival  taliesin thats a terrible thought  marisha but you are and vex isnt wrong  taliesin i know there are things that one day i will speak of that im not really ready to deal  with yet but i think 
none	 i may even have something that could help us with the dragons i have a  thought im going to work on it on our way to the island  liam now im nervous  taliesin it will be something that once the dragons are felled i plan on destroying  immediately after and i think youll be all right with it when you see it its too complicated for  any one person to really deal with but i will feel much better if she is in the ground  laura well im interested in seeing it  marisha 
none	 percy you know you can talk to us right you never share ideas with us  taliesin i do i told you my idea of killing all the dragonborn to start a war between the  dragons  marisha all right well  taliesin thats why i dont share those ideas im not proud of them  laura is this thing youre building going to kill a lot of people in addition to the dragon  taliesin i hope not but it could it could make it very easy to kill a lot of people  liam one day at 
none	 a time gang lets deal with ripley first  taliesin lets deal with ripley lets collect a few more things that will help us deal with home  lets save home and then i will spend some good time undoing some of the damage that ive done i  should have killed her i should have  marisha you shouldnt feel regret about not taking another persons life its a moment of  humanity  taliesin it wasnt i was not being kind i was being selfish i didnt kill her because the  briarwoods mattered more to me even 
none	 though i knew that she was far more dangerous that if  they had escaped the world would be darker two more vampires or whatever but she was the genie  and i knowingly and very willingly said im fine with that and i knew at that moment this was not  a thought i had later in my head i went she is going to kill hundreds of people and thats okay  right now  laura percy if you had stayed with her and let the briarwoods go a god a terrible god would  probably be loosed 
none	 on the land right now i think you chose correctly  taliesin i think i stumbled into the correct answer im not sure i chose correctly i think i  got lucky  marisha did you not want to kill her because in a way you feel responsible for who she is  taliesin oh i feel absolutely responsible for inspiring a maniac of course i do  liam look were going to help you get to her youre going to get her youve got to let us in  on it a bit though all right  taliesin once 
none	 i have something drawn ill show you what it is and ill have something drawn by  tomorrow something simple  liam thats a promise  taliesin that is absolutely a promise  marisha also i know youre really smart but were smart too dont insult our intelligence by  assuming we cant comprehend one of your ideas  taliesin oh no youll comprehend it and its not that i dont think you can comprehend it i know  you can its that i know what it says about me that i even thought it  marisha percy percy

none	 travis you did  sam yeah yep  taliesin well done  sam so im going to leave marquet totally evens  laura thats great  taliesin thats amazing  sam yup pretty good  taliesin i wish i could say that  liam oh cheers to that cheers  sam still batting a thousand this guy unstoppable me  travis now we can leave whenever were ready  sam oh yeah lets pack our bags  laura right now  sam oh wait no we still have to decurse the thing  laura oh the enchantment right were waiting 
tavern	 on that thats why were fucking here  matt you guys go back down to the main area  liam so many things  laura shall we bring the weapon down there  liam that seems like a bad idea  taliesin once theyre here actually yes why not  laura yay then trinkets with us again  matt yes all so you guys head back down to the main thoroughfare or the main area of the  tavern  travis yeah  matt there you see the same folks are there you see treev is there and you see 
dung	 a shiftylooking  guy a rather pointed nose very shallow features and his hands are together he has a satchel over  his shoulder and these long plain looking robes and his thinning short dark hair is slicked  against his skull he has a thin mustache goatee right there and hes sitting at the edge of the  bar talking to treev  laura so he looks totally trustworthy  matt totally trustworthy  matt as soon as you guys walk down the stairs  liam is he that picture of you on the carousel  matt basically yes 
none	 but with the shorter slicked hair  taliesin im glad thats a thing again i really missed that  matt i dont know how to take that actually based on how i just described the npc  liam its more the grimace  taliesin i suddenly can hear thousands of twitch viewers googling googling like mad  matt noted  liam whoops and then vax died  matt disadvantage for the rest of the episode no treev goes oh and here they are the ones  who hired your help folks id like to introduce you to kyme hes one 
tavern	 of our fine allies in the  omnival library here in the city and i believe he can take care of your little problem so talk  and the guy spins around on the stool at the edge of the bar and goes okay so i have been told  that you require some sort of disenchantment type thing who am i talking to here theres a  lot of you you okay come  taliesin all right i have an object so hard to talk to that face  laura scanlan he seems like the type you might want 
none	 to try selling him some of that fusaka  taliesin i have an object that i own that someone is tracking me with they are aware of my  whereabouts theyve put some kind of enchantment on it i was wondering if i could transfer that  enchantment to another object and send it in a different direction so that they dont know that were  following them  matt thats possible yes  taliesin i would even be willing if possible to remove part of the object that i currently own  and then replace it with something else 
none	 if necessary  matt depending on the strength of the enchantment that can take anywhere within the  next few weeks  taliesin can i get you a drink are you all right  matt why why do you ask  laura can i insight check him  matt make an insight check yeah  liam yay  sam may i make a physiological check of his mouth shape his jaw seems  liam new matt character  taliesin i know  laura 19  matt 19  sam you know at shopgeekandsundrycom theres a lot of new items up

none	 where the enchantment is  sam youre showing him the gun we just said dont show people the gun  laura we need to remove the enchantment from it  sam okay  laura if we can remove the enchantment if it takes a long time to transfer maybe you can keep  transferring it after weve left is that a thing  matt i can get rid of the enchantment immediately but its gone transfer thats a  timetaking process its much more expensive than what i was promised as part of this contract  looks back to treev 
none	 treevs leaning back and hes like i just brought you here to talk with them  taliesin we just want to know our options sir and time is sadly of the essence what can you tell us about this  matt strange construction  taliesin yes  matt ah i see what youre talking about he starts glancing shut up glancing at the  bottom of retort it is a variation on a scrying enchantment with a hint of a messagetype base  its audio only not visual  marisha son of a bitch  taliesin can they track where 
none	 we are  matt they cannot track location but this is a joint enchantment there are two pieces to this  and it would appear that wherever the receiving end is they can probably hear everything around it  marisha guys this could be a gift think of the possibilities  travis shes hearing this right now  sam if shes listening  matt oh im sure whoever has the other side of this enchantment is now well aware of everything  weve just discussed  laura great  sam maybe we should take it out of the room  
none	 taliesin shh no  matt who has the other side of this enchantment by the way and he suddenly looks extremely  nervous beads of sweat start showing up on his forehead  taliesin ill tell you what you do the work quickly you do the work well and you follow a  few other instructions of ours and i will not say her name out loud right now how does that sound  to you  matt what do you want disenchantment transference tell me  taliesin not anymore we just want the enchantment destroyed and i will not 
none	 say her  name so that she will know that you do not know who she is  matt what does that mean what does that mean whats he saying what is he saying  sam for your own protection  taliesin this is me giving you a deal good sir this is me showing you respect and you if you  can hear me and i get the sneaking suspicion you can im not ignoring you anymore  sam wait before you do a quick word is there a way to reverse the direction okay  matt reaches into 
none	 a little pouch of components on the side takes things crushes them sprinkles  them on looks about ahem its done its gone here  laura what really  marisha can i check it  matt yeah  marisha scanlan help me check this  laura that fast  sam all right  laura you are very powerful you  marisha what do we do here  matt make an arcana check  marisha scanlan help  sam yeah i got a natural one sister  marisha oh boy 16  matt as youre staring at it you watch as 
dung	 the ripley signature thats very very small put in  the bottom of the piece of whitestone begins to glow suddenly he goes by the way it takes a  moment put your face away please and as you pull it back it flashes and then goes dark  again and now its done  marisha okay ill look at it again what does it look like  matt looks the same  marisha what do you mean it looks the same  matt meaning like the signatures still there the stone is still there but that slight essence  
none	 of slight enchantment that was there before is gone  taliesin you wouldnt happen to know where to get some construction materials on very quick notice  matt no  laura you wouldnt be able to identify something for me would you  taliesin oh yes go ahead do that  laura you seem so smart is all  matt this was not part of the agreement  laura darling were already here please  taliesin and we didnt say your name  matt make a persuasion check  marisha and we didnt say your name  laura oh damn 
none	 it i will pay you  matt how much  laura how much do you want  matt looks back at treev treev goes  laura just to identify something thats all dear  taliesin something simple  matt 100 gold please  laura 100 gold darling it seemed effortless for you to do that before is it hard  matt i have a shop to get back to im sorry i cant be here any longer  laura fine fine  matt and he gets up from the stool  laura shit fine a hundred gold whatever i just 
none	 want to know can you look at this please  its a tea set its gold isnt it beautiful  matt takes it from you and his hands are clammy as he pulls it out of your grasp and he looks  over the tea set and its in his hands he doesnt really know what to do with it and he  places it on the side okay begins breathing heavily and its fogging the side of the metallic  tea set and you see this sweat dripping off of his nose hes still very nervous about this  
none	 endeavor and wants to get out of here as soon as possible all right this is a tea set of  envenoming whenever you produce some sort of a liquid imbibement within the tea set its  guaranteed to be a bad day for whoever drinks from it  laura its so good we didnt drink from it  taliesin does the liquid hold its potency or is it just within the tea set  matt for a day  taliesin good to know  laura lovely  taliesin excellent  sam will someone die  matt im not a 
none	 master of poisons i just know that it poisons  laura thank you so much  matt and he takes it and holds it and is like 100 gold  laura of course dear  matt thank you and as soon as he gets it he lets go of it puts it in his pouch and good  day treev careful next time and he darts off outside bursting through the door and into the  alley and treev sits  taliesin i was imagining the fbi agent from the frighteners i was having a lot of that  marisha 
none	 i was imagining the creep music video from lonely island  matt kind of yeah actually treev is like now that was fun to watch  laura that guy was weird  matt hes a weird one i knew hed do the job but honestly i like watching him twitch  taliesin thank you that was very helpful that was very helpful they dont know that were  coming as they dont know how were going or why because we have spoken all of that outside of the  range of that device they dont know any of that  
town	 marisha true the gun was in the other room  taliesin all they know is that we found the enchantment and killed it  liam should we melt it just in case  taliesin no there will be no more melting of my property for a little while yet i have a bit of a  quick shopping list before we head out of town i was wondering if it would be possible to gather  some quick supplies if some of your people knew where to get simple construction materials  quickly today  laura and potions of healing 
none	  matt potions head to the suncut bazaar im sure you could find a few folks we usually get ours  from and he starts looking through a list he goes lets see theres  liam are we staying here for the night before heading out in the morning  travis and taliesin no  liam so were sleeping on the ship  travis and taliesin yes  matt nisaba are the two i know of at least  laura saaba and what  matt usar and nisaba  laura theyll give a good deal  matt perhaps you ask 
none	 them nicely  taliesin i need lumber steel lead and a couple other things very simple just some materials  ill show you what im building and ill have you figure out the number  matt right  taliesin loaded straight on the ship  matt what youre looking for is the bone garden its the northernmost side of the suncut bazaar  they deal with a lot of the not guildrun sales of various construction means more for the  residential folk here in ankharel  taliesin thatll do  matt for the sake of brevity what are you 
none	 searching for  taliesin im trying to get enough construction material to build a very basic 125pound mountable  cannon that i can move around the ship on wheels and a little bit of shot for a cannon about five  pound shot its simple but its going to be a son of a bitch  matt there are cannons made that technology  taliesin does exist but does something that small that can move around a ship exist this  would be something that four people could pick up and move around  matt that small the few things 
none	 they have here theyre magicallybased fire its similar to the  dragon arbalist installation its not so much a gunpowderbased explosion since that is mostly  unutilized this is a metal tube that contains an enchantment that throws out bursts of energy you  could purchase a base for one of those constructs that would cut down the time  because if youre going to make a cannon thats going to be an endeavor thatll take you a long time  taliesin a base will do and i need to build a thing to build cannonballs  matt takes you 
none	 the better part of the day to even find out asking around because treev doesnt know  anything about where to find the base for a cannon like that takes you the better part of the rest  of the day pushing into dusk for you to find out where that could be purchased thats going to run you  about 60 gold  taliesin im good with that  matt its not enchanted  taliesin 60 gold and then a little extra to make cannonballs and otherwise get them to deliver it  to the ship and im sending 
none	 everything to be delivered immediately to the ship  matt anything else anyone wants to prepare  laura potions i need healing potions who needs healing potions  sam all of us  taliesin everybody  marisha sure  matt on streetlevel sales asking around the most you can acquire are probably any number of  common regular healing potions you may want through conversations at most five of the greater  can be purchased  laura okay scanlan can you come with me  sam yes  laura can we find a hand of ord  matt yeah not 
town	 too hard to find at all quick look around a hand of ord especially here in the  market  sam flash the thing what am i flashing it for  laura i want to talk to him  liam get the cube out  sam oi mate were friends with jmon sa ord  laura were not making a street deal right now  sam oh i thought everything was here  taliesin this could be part of your problem here  matt he bends down after giving you a weird eyebrow  sam im a normal human man 
none	  matt youre still in your  sam i forgot to take it off  matt so youre a normal human man in nonankharel attire shows off the necklace he looks at it  how did you come about that  laura we met with jmon sa ord earlier we have their blessing  matt make a persuasion check  laura 18  matt 18 total  laura yeah  matt he goes okay what can i be of service to you  laura were in need of some healing potions im assuming as a guard of the city you 
none	 have access  to quite a few  matt could probably muster a few from the barracks yes  laura some greater healing potions would be wonderful  matt ill get what we can spare we still have to keep enough to maintain our watch  laura of course  matt wait here give me a halfhour  sam okay  matt you guys wait for him and he comes back with six regular healing potions and three greater  sam this thing is the best thing ever im not holding anything but its still cool  laughter  laura 
none	 six regular  travis and three greater  matt this is what we can spare from the nearby barracks  laura thank you so much your aid is appreciated  matt if i could have your names just to be safe that everything is  laura be pleased vox machina  matt vox machina  laura and then i want to buy like three more greaters  matt all right that is 1500 gold  laura can i say i haggled  matt roll a persuasion check  assorted muttering  laura shut up  marisha big money no whammies 
none	  laura natural 20  all oh  travis the sorcery is strong with this one apparently  matt through diving between two different locations that sell these potions and forcing them  to basically bid back and forth for your business you manage to work it down to 1100 gold pieces for  the three greater healing potions  taliesin its like youve got amazoncom on your phone and youre going eh eh  laura all right three more greater healing potions  matt yes  laura sounds good  sam you saved 400 gold want to kick some 
none	 of that to this guy well ive been helping you all day  shuttling back and forth between those two  laura can i insight check him  matt go for it  taliesin its not going to work but oh i hope it does  matt make a deception check  liam oh its high  travis chuckles youre fucked  sam its not that good  laura 27  matt remember you can also add your own inspiration die if you want to  sam no no need lets see here you said 27  laura yeah  
none	 sam 26  gasping  matt for the first time you see a crack in scanlan shorthalts veneer you see a bit of sweat  at his brow and as he mentions this money suddenly you see this quiver to his smile his  teeth shine not as bright as you recall and theres a taste of desperation you never knew was there at  the mention of money  travis the faintest nosebleed  laura darling  sam strained yes  laura we all have off days  sam strained ive had a whole off city  laura were 
none	 about to leave  sam strained please can we  laura we can i wont tell anyone  sam all right so like 200 gold then  travis please sir  laura i give him 50 thats for lying to me  sam thank you i want to go away from this place  liam can we get back to politics please  laura all right minus 1100  matt i like to imagine when this whole campaigns over scanlan shorthalt comes back and cleans out  the casino in vengeance  liam as the airship bears down on ankharel 
none	  matt i meant monetarily but that works too  liam scarface  travis even though its dusk should we mount up tonight  sam yes  laura yes lets go get on the boat  travis lets head to the skies  liam this is really happening  taliesin im so excited  liam weve joked about it for ages  travis singing indalla  matt all right you all make your way to the sky port  taliesin yes  sam ah it wouldve been so much sweeter if we couldve stolen the airship but getting it for 
none	  free feels right  taliesin we got it for a steal  matt all right so you guys make your way up to the terraced platform above the sky port the  larger ship you guys saw earlier is no longer there it has taken off and now all you see  before you is the ship deera that is currently down the six chains have been reduced to two and  it appears to be at the ready as opposed to its resting position now the fan on the sides is  unfurled the crystals themselves glow with 
none	 a faint blue energy signature as the dusk sun  begins to set its much more prominent now and a series of four rope ladders have been dropped from the  side of the actual ship  sam ladies your chariot awaits  marisha no i make sure scanlan goes first  sam all right  matt all right  laura i turn around and wink at him as i go up  matt all right you guys make your way up the rope ladders this is indeed the ship that you  made across although it has a new 
none	 paint job on it it looks a little bit nicer but it also seems  to have seen some disuse you make your way onto the board and there you can see familiar ship  hands that go around nodding to you out of recognition some of them are pulling up the rope  ladders behind you you see two on the bottom there are now unchaining from the edge of where  its latched onto the side of the ship on each side that keeps it latched into the skyport and  captain damon comes up to the top 
none	 to greet you very well i see that youve come to begin the  journey well it is a pleasure to see you all again safe and sound although you are missing  one two actually  taliesin yes were a bit thinner it has been difficult and we have friends elsewhere preparing  for more difficult times are you aware of whats going on across the sea  matt im very aware that was the guild that owned the ship and ran our business disappeared in  the attack and weve been set adrift making our own money and 
none	 making ends meet in the meantime  doing odd jobs here and there  taliesin well if youre interested we are definitely moving towards correcting some of these  problems quickly  matt if you do tell the guild that the ship crashed because as of right now its technically  my ship  taliesin is this an insurance thing  matt i didnt the guild owned and ran the shipping business but i mean  taliesin oh no yes im a deep believer in insurance fraud of course  matt its not sighs  liam were friends here youre 
none	 good  matt id like to know where were going as that is part of the deal to be kept secret until boarding  travis actually if you dont mind were heading north once were away from port we plan to  inform you of our destination  taliesin tomorrow  matt north it is very well and he pulls a whistle from around his neck and blows it really  loudly and everyone unleashes the chains from the side clanking sound they crash down slamming  onto the terrace deck below the ship lurches and lifts up a few 
none	 feet naturally and finding its own  balance based on the enchantment of the crystals you can stay on the edge if youd like youre  welcome to find your quarters down below but we are about to make sail he walks to the edge of  the ship the middle of the ship the back where you can see he directs the position of it and  controls the crystals themselves and the giant dragonheaded arbalist you see installed at the  side theyre like the giant heavy crossbows that are bolted onto the side these large spears the 
dung	  ones you were using in the fight before theyre nearly twice the size of what they were and the  front of them have this giant dark metal dragon head that is built around it its been definitely  fitted to be a much more badass airship than you remember it lifts up and as the last bit of the  sun disappears below the distant horizon and the city of ankharels lighting up for the evening  time you take up into the sky slowly turning northward towards what you can see as barely  visible the silhouetted 
none	 edge of the mountain range before you the agrad mountains making your way  to the rest of your journey and were going to go ahead and take a break well come back here in  just a minute  travis one thing before we do we forgot to mention that next week during game the game  thanks to magic puzzle quest matt and marisha taliesin liam and myself will be joining ivan  and becca for game the game from 530 to 630 so make sure you tune in its going to be a very  special game 
none	 the game thank you magic puzzle quest  laura also thank you backblaze  matt all right guys well see you in a few minutes thank you travis  break  matt hello and welcome back to critical role so as we left off vox machina is  laura wait before we do that we forgot to mention at the top of the show theres only one  week of preorder left on the bracelets and the pins  travis yeah we wouldnt want people to miss out its limited run  taliesin i dont have a bracelet but i 
none	 have the pins  laura hes wearing the bracelet  sam laura i did mention that while you were getting whispered to  laura i know you did i heard you but you know in case people were drowning you out and  then we also have the limited items which we only have a little bit left in the store the nail  wraps and the patches that were limited edition at comiccon that are still there i  think still in the store so yeah  taliesin were the rings up in there  laura the rings and 
none	 the rings the spinning rings  taliesin did they come back in  travis and the mug which is my favorite okay now were good  laura okay sorry  matt all right no worries thank you for mentioning that vox machina as night has taken  the sky and you lift up heading northward you watch as the glowing jewel of ankharel begins to  slowly grow smaller and smaller in the distance below you you see a mass of black darkness  marisha i want to take percy to the front of the ship  taliesin ah thats 
none	 my  marisha set it down  taliesin ill put it down okay  marisha and i want to  taliesin whispers i feel so dirty  marisha whispers say you can fly  taliesin no  marisha say you can fly  taliesin no because im not going to say that its not true its not true  marisha say youre flying  taliesin i feel sick  marisha laughs damn it  laura dont throw up again  liam while theyre doing that im actually flying next to the ship and praying for a while  out in 
dung	 the dark  matt okay so yeah you have very little idea of where you are other than watching the city slowly  disappear above as you look towards the front of the ship where its going you can see little  specks of light in the distance almost like smaller cities or villages that slowly begin to  move past and below you and the stars in the sky breaking through some of the clouds that  occasionally block as you progress as the ship begins to rise about cloud level you can see the  very faint outline 
none	 of the mountain range and you then coast above it as you begin to finally crest  over the top of the mountain range itself captain damon locks the ship steering mechanism in place  and walks back to address all of you and goes all right were well on our way were heading  north weve been travelling for a number of hours now where are we going  taliesin before  matt sighs  taliesin i swear this is important before we say anything we would like to take a moment to meet  the rest of the 
none	 crew  travis yes and all hands on deck  taliesin to make sure that nobody suspicious has snuck on board and nobody is hiding their  identity  matt very well he gathers the rest of the crew you recognize a few of them they have a few  new faces because they lost a few on the last journey you individually meet each one with  pretty heavy inspection from you guys i want you to make insight checks all of you as youre  inspecting this crew  taliesin no  sam 15  travis 19  
none	 laura 22  liam 15  matt all right glancing about mostly human crew there is one elf a female whos part of  the crew who handles most direct navigation with the captain now and you hadnt met before her  name is julia and she seems nice enough there is a female halfling who has very nice cleancut  hair pulled into a heavy ponytail in the back and as she smiles you can see her somewhat broken  and rotted teeth as you guys give the whole lookover she smiles and looks a little nervous  at 
none	 the rest of you you take a closer look and you pick up on it vex this is one of the bandits  the one you took captive on the journey over to vasselheim  laura the one that i harpooned  matt yes she apparently has become one of the crew now  laura wow well we vouched for her at the time  marisha we wanted her right are we cool  travis she dies  taliesin good for you excellent  marisha whats her name did we ever get a name from her  matt teela  
none	 all teela  matt teera sorry r teera i had it written down i should look at my sheet first  taliesin and theres no magic attempts to hide somebodys face or anything like that  matt no you guys all give a good look and a very thorough inspection of the crew and they all seem  legitimate  taliesin and this is everybody  matt yes  travis captain  matt yes  travis who is it thats in charge of your seaworthy navigations the newest member of your  crew you mentioned  matt well that would 
none	 be teera shes actually been all about this ocean not necessarily by  skyship but she knows the area as well and has since studied up and has become a very esteemed  member of our crew he looks to her and teeras smile broadens again that is correct im happy  to help in wherever it is youre looking to go where are you going  sam shall we lay it on them then were going to go near the island of glass aka glintshore  matt you watch her face go and captain damon goes why glintshore that 
none	 place is a rocky waste  sam well were not going there were going near it to find a shipwreck  matt shipwreck theres probably hundreds of them the place is dotted with reefs  taliesin were looking for a ship called the shrew  matt so youre wanting us to take you to the hespet archipelago  marisha yeah  taliesin there is another ship on the way there as well  travis some say archipelago but yeah  taliesin there may be trouble  sam the other ship may already be there and if we can find the 
none	 other ship then weve found our  destination  matt right the archipelago lets see we have no sundry were holding so were at maximum  speed id say two maybe three days of travel depending on weather  sam just to get in the area itll take us another day or two to find this ship  taliesin well not necessarily every day we scry every day we hone in we keep following where  theyre going  marisha ideally she does the hard work for us  travis its worth noting as well that if we do find 
none	 this ship we do not mean her well  matt i can only assume going to hespet  marisha you seem very familiar with this place do you have more information  liam or apprehension  matt hespit is a the whole network of islands there is a haven for criminals fugitives  pirates and everyone else who generally keeps away from the large continents so you go without  guard stay without threat youre likely to be bent into slavery or end up left bleeding  somewhere on the shoreline  travis is that a promise  laura were 
none	 super powerful  liam you do the flying well do the fucking shit up  matt well have to come in low most likely i dont want to try and draw attention to this ship  because im sure it would fetch quite a penny if it were to fall into the hands of  travis im sure keyleth would provide you with some cover as well  matt well that would be very much appreciated  marisha i could do that  matt thankfully glintshore itself is pretty much useless to most of their standards of business  practices 
none	 its mostly ignored by them from what i know at least of what they do but still just  to be safe and be careful  sam has teera been around there does she know anything of that particular shipwreck  matt hes about to talk and teera pipes up i do actually and i will be guiding us directly to  it so dont worry  sam to the shipwreck  matt not to the shipwreck but to the glintshore  sam have you heard of that shipwreck the shrew  matt i have not but there are plenty 
dung	 of shipwrecks in the area im sure theres much to  recover if thats what youre looking for  laura no well stick with the shrew  matt ill take you where i can  travis the island of glass is it called that because of a glass production site  laughter  sam yep  laura was that hard for you grog  travis i hurt myself  matt captain damon says i dont know the history exactly but at some point in time  something really bad happened all the sand of the shores were fused into dark 
none	 brown and black glass  its a jagged landscape leading all the way up to the mountain the jungle is petrified and dead  its not a welcoming place im surprised why anyone would pay so much to go there but im sure  you have your reasons  marisha can i do a nature check to see if that sounds familiar  matt sure  marisha beasts or something that would happen heat a lot of fucking heat 26  matt to fuse the beaches or an island its entirety would require such extreme fierce heat  this is 
none	 going through your mind as well percy being a man who understands this science very  well something very bad had to have happened here a long time ago on a very large scale to render an  island pretty much covered in glass  laura do you think this is where they knocked thordak down didnt they fight thordak in the  ocean  marisha thats what my thought was would a dragons breath  matt a dragons breath would fuse a small chunk of the beach here  marisha what about if a bunch of sorcerers and magic 
none	 users got together and made a big nuke  matt thats possible very little chance there would be any survivors  liam like a meteor or a comet from the sky  taliesin even a comet wouldnt be enough this is big  marisha keyteor  matt as you guys are having this conversation he goes the mountain still stands the jungle still  stands though petrified and burnt i know not the means that brought it to where it is but its  been that way for as long as we have history on it long ago  marisha 
none	 how long ago was it  matt im assuming the age of arcanum if anything  travis right you said we have quarters on this ship do you mind if i sleep under the stars  matt be my guest  travis rocking going to commune with nature in my own way fart in the wind  taliesin im going to be far away from that  travis no one wants to join me get all hippie up on the deck of the ship  laura ill do that ill sleep out and trinket will want to do that as 
none	 well  liam i actually do yeah  matt bear noises  laura stars trinket beautiful  liam speaking of heat make with the bed farts trinket i get cold at night  sam keyleth make sure you learn your scrying spells for tomorrow do we still have that ball  the scryball  matt yep  laura well have two scrys tomorrow if you learn the spell  marisha i could theoretically do three scrys tomorrow i could theoretically do five scrys  tomorrow  travis i pay super close attention but after we gave them the destination did 
none	 they tell us how  long it would take  sam two three days  matt depending on the weather  travis what if we pass over the ship in the night  taliesin then well attack them in the night  sam how will we see them is there someone who stands watch at night  marisha she knows where were going so shell let us know if we get there  sam but were looking for the boat not the island  taliesin the boat itself theres work that always needs to be done therell be lights  
none	 unless they are hiding  liam you can alert one of us if we come upon a ship in the night or day correct  matt i have to sleep at some point as well  liam of course but someone is awake  matt deshall who is my second in command will take over while im sleeping there will be  someone here along with a few hands taking shifts as well at all times  marisha i describe the ship to them from what ive seen  laura but its in the ocean isnt it and were very 
none	 high above it  travis do we want to go lower  sam yes  travis how high off the deck would you say  sam off the sea three maybe four feet no i dont know couple hundred feet youre the captain  matt were okay for now high is fine but once we get close to the archipelago well want to make  sure that we keep within 100 feet of the surface i could take it into the ocean this can  work as a functional ship in the water  travis shut the hell up well 
none	 we want to stay out right now  matt well then you seem weary enough you may have your rest and rest assured that well be to  your destination as soon as this ship can carry us im going to rest myself he goes down to his  quarters and deshall takes over who is midthirties grizzled scruff on his chin but  put together well hair parted to one side not a man of many words he takes over the helm and  keeps it going through the night you guys go ahead and rest for the evening 
none	  liam im going to meditate for an hour before bed  travis could i take a shot of the sandkheg bottle i would like to slowly start building up  an immunity  matt all righty make a constitution saving throw grog  liam grog voice meaning i would like to get  fucked up on a regular basis  travis 29  matt you drink it you feel the sparkling numbness begin to spread across your throat its  strange its weird its exhilarating it triggers your adrenaline and you almost go into a  rage from the 
none	 instinctual reaction of that sort of chemical release in your brain you hold it in  place and you sit there a second and stare as it slowly goes down your system you feel the warm  curling burn from inside your belly that fine alcohol gives you that little shimmer of pins and  needles down the back of your neck and your spine your vision begins to blur a little bit it takes  you a lot of alcohol to get trashed but youre a little buzzed  travis sick awesome well played sandkheg i go to sleep 
none	  matt with your nightcap you are good to go looking under the stars you finish your  meditation everyone else you go to rest fine throughout the evening you sleep the last thing  you see before you go to bed is the edge of the mountain range late into the night and a small  sparkle in a crescent shape you ask one of the hands to the side he points over and says the  bay of gifts this is the northern side where you see shamal the port city thats the last little  bastion of 
none	 civilization of marquet as it begins to approach from underneath as you all go to sleep  the continent is behind you  marisha how many hours has it been  matt when you come to consciousness after the evenings rest  laura i want to hold fenthras in my hand and keep thinking about the things saundor said  matt after a good eight hour rest for all of you to recover yourselves hit points everything  spells you come to the warmth of the sun is what kicks you into consciousness its been about 13  hours since 
none	 you guys left eight hours of rest you had five hours of travel northward until you  began to reach the northern end of the continent on this skyship  taliesin this might be the best sleep that weve gotten in months at this point like babies  sam is it morning time  matt yeah  sam you want to do that morning scry  marisha yeah morning scry  taliesin im going to sit down with a pen and paper ready to write  marisha yeah morning constitutional here we come bust out whatever magazines they have  
none	 nearby cup of coffee first  matt all right using the same journal  taliesin lets use the gun now lets go nuts  sam now that its been decursed will that mess up  taliesin its got a lot of her work in it  matt all right are you using the crystal first  marisha yeah crystal first  matt whats the crystal dc because its not your actual spell which i should have remembered last  time i mean she rolled low enough last time that it wasnt an issue  marisha it doesnt say  matt 
dung	 okay then it should be 15 thats a natural one as youre concentrating on the scry spell  your vision once again is thrust through the clouds thrown down over the ocean you see for a  brief moment a cluster of dark land roughly in the shape of a bean or a cashew from this  perspective and then it flashes downward and you can see a ship a ship that is on the water it is  stationary  marisha docked like anchors down  matt seemingly the sails arent up  travis its not at land its 
none	 in the water  matt yeah your vision flashes again and you can see the crew have all gathered on the deck though  details of their visage are obscured by the spell you see ripley there with her cloak she is  talking to the rest of the crew and goes all right so weve located it we have eight hours  gather your things and drink well they all pull out these small vials uncork and drink down  they all nod one by one they start diving off the ship and into the water five people youre 
none	  not sure of the sex and ripley dive off the side youre following her as she goes underwater  you can see the bubbles go past then the bubbles are no more and you watch as she is now breathing  the water like its air swimming downward all of them are carrying you see on the side these  heavy rock weights that are letting them guide down deeper into the water as it gets darker  until theres almost nothing to see then theres a flicker of light and you see ripley is now  holding her 
none	 gun theres a beam of light on the end of it thats giving them torchlight as they go  deeper in then the spell fades  marisha shes found it shes there  travis shes got it  marisha she doesnt have it but shes found the ship shes right off the shore of the island  laura can you scry again immediately  marisha shes under the water i mean i could  travis how is she under the water  marisha they all took water breathing potions her plus five other people  taliesin was there anything around 
dung	 could you see the island in sight  marisha i saw the island it was dark in landscape  matt it was such a brief shot because it wasnt the focus of the scry spell even the fact that  you caught a glimpse of it was a strange side effect of the scry attempt  taliesin was the sun with the island or was the sun away from the island is there any way to even  know that were they on the north side or the south side  matt from what you can gather at this time 
none	 no thats part of the scry spell you wouldnt be  able to tell  liam im heading over to find the captain and the halfling to ask how far they estimate we are from  the island  marisha i heard ripley say we have eight hours  laura thats how long the spell lasts  travis i have two vials of underwater breathing  marisha ill take water breathing as a spell  laura how many people can you cast it on  matt water breathing as a spell actually lasts for 24 hours the potions only last 
none	 for eight  marisha is it concentration  matt nope it grants up to ten willing creatures you can see  marisha what ten willing  laura thats sick  marisha i got us on lock you guys  taliesin i had a plan im putting it away  matt yeah so the potion enchantments are lesser than the spell but the actual druidic spell  effect is much better you see him looking off in the distance as youre asking the question he  points and goes well given that might slow us down a bit you look ahead 
dung	 and you now see  immediately visible from this point  laura dont be a green dragon  matt what you are able to make out because its a familiar sight to you are very tall dark  distant thunderheads the storm that you saw in your first vision keyleth apparently is still  swirling its way through the middle of the ocean its violent its visceral and you can see the  weight of the water giving it this deep dark gray color and the rest of the ocean below is  obscured with the blur of rainfall he 
none	 goes those are high clouds i cant get above them  the enchantment is only so strong to get us into that thinner air so i recommend everyone hold on  liam is there anything you can do about this  marisha i can get us closer  matt what  taliesin trust her shes crazy  marisha straight through fastest route captain  matt okay i trust you he brings it around and begins pulling forward you can see this little  metallic rod on the side and he pushes it forward even further the crystals flicker for a 
none	 second  and the whole ship leans in a forward direction it takes about an hour before the shade from the  thunderheads which you cant even see where they stop they go up and up and up begin to meet  youre starting to see flashes in the clouds of lightning  marisha i go ahead and i start casting my first 8thlevel spell which is control weather its  everything ive ever wanted you guys  matt yeah concentration for up to eight hours so you guys watch as keyleth stands at the bow of  the ship 
none	 puts her arms out and you see the flashes of lightning in the cloud a bolt strikes  her in one arm she holds it in place the bolt uses her as a conduit and then vanishes into her  arm her other arm pulls another bolt to it and it vanishes into her arm you can see the energys  now circling around she brings her arms out and thrusts them into the storm the lightning  protrudes out of each arm as it hits the clouds the clouds seem to almost melt away and carve this  central 
none	 path the clouds are being pushed back at gale force these winds are separating them you  watch for five miles around you the storm basically parts to nearly nothing except for the  very peripheral to the right and left side you hear captain damon go okay i see your point  liam hot fucking damn keyleth  laura you know i thought it was a possibility but this is the first time im sure your  girlfriend is way cooler than you  liam everyone knew that  matt so pushing forward keyleth is concentrating at the edge 
none	 of the ship her eyes spark with  energy youre almost like the mermaid at the front of the ship at this point youre right at  the front arms out  liam youre like a reverse pyro youre undoing all the violence  matt the shade fades away the clear blue sky above then invites these warm sun beams down upon  the top of the ship  laura i do some sunbathing  marisha i make it temperate with a nice warm breeze  sam keyleth can you make the breeze behind us and can you make it 
tavern	 rather strong  marisha can i do that  taliesin hes reading he doesnt know  sam well you said it lasts eight hours  taliesin hes checking to see if its a thing you can actually do  liam checking his stocks message from mom  matt what you can do is you can clear the storm for five miles and then subtly change to a wind  stage behind you yes ill let you do that sure  marisha make the winds in our favor im drunk on power  matt the wind begins to build from behind 
none	 some of you have to duck down now because its starting  to take it almost takes your hat off scanlan you catch it but it is picking up speed and you  guys are beginning to coast forward occasionally the winds die down as you have to clear more of  the storm over the next six or so hours you come out the other side of the storm  marisha i go into a deep meditation this is some buddhist shit going on for me right now  matt perfect as the storm subsides your ship has a 
none	 clear view of distant breaks in the patterns  of waves on the horizon multiple chained islands many miles apart from each other emerge this  youve now begun to reach is the hespet archipelago each of the twelve islands vary in  size from massive rock to pebblelike protrusions they span and are scattered and the ship begins  to veer to the left as the captain begins to zero in on your destination he yells out were going  low they have visibility the ship begins to go into a relatively steep decline you hear the wood  
none	 creaking with the sudden shift in direction and weight the gem on the right side begins to  brighten while the one on the left begins to darken slightly exemplifying the shift in energy  and power eventually youre brought down nearly coasting on the surface of the ocean and as you  get to about 40 50 feet above you see the waves begin to part beneath it as whatever force is  holding it there is now pushing the water down he brings it up a little so its not breaking the  surface and coasts at an 
none	 even 60 feet above pushing forward you already begin to see what you  assume is the isle of glintshore in this clear sunlit moment you also see throughout the ocean  clusters of dangerous jaggedlooking reef some ten 15 below the surface some actually breaching  the surface of the ocean some even deeper this portion of the ocean is like a maze network of  every ship captains nightmare you get the feeling why this has become a favored place of  criminals to avoid pursuers and also why people who trade avoid it for many reasons not 
none	 just  those who stay here and also why the shipwreck probably found its way here as you begin to grow  closer to the island you see as it begins to come more into form there is a singular mountain  peak thats shifted mostly to the western side its not a super peak its a gradual point you  can see a little bit of a brushlike detail of the jungle that you had heard mentioned before he  begins to bring you up towards the southern shore of the island at this point of perspective the  
none	 sunlight thats hitting the island is causing a glittery shift of thousands of points of light  across the beach shoreline deep into where the blackened jungle tree line is its beautiful  its a very strange and aweinspiring sight to be such a small little forgotten part of the land and  to look so pretty from this distance  the closer you get the beauty begins to fade as you see the black beaches you can see the  landscape is barren and broken aside from the ashen gray and black jungle plants and trees that  have 
none	 been left there dead for an extended period of time the mountain itself the rock itself  going from black to a ruddy red and brown color the sands themselves and the glass surface across  the eastern shore that tends to reach out almost like a mouth of a creature is rough and varied in  topography you also see within that bay a tiny little thing that looks like a ship  liam are we close enough to see if theres people on the deck  matt youre not close enough youre barely now seeing that theres a 
none	 ship  marisha its been six hours you said since i did my scry  matt probably about seven hours now since you did the spell  laura theyre going to be coming out any minute  marisha they have one hour left  laura unless theyre already out  liam yeah thats the duration of the spell the eight hours they could be back already  marisha if we have one hour left they could fail they could not find it at all  laura could we shoot the boat from above and destroy their escape  travis could 
none	 i make a song request could we drop your big rocky ass from 300 feet up right through  the bottom of their ship and sink that bitch  taliesin ill also say theres nothing a ship doesnt like more than fire  laura yes  marisha i mean all of these things are very appealing to me right now im just trying to  understand why  sam well we cant let them escape  liam its better that theyre floating on the water than standing on the ship  travis and if they have a teleportation circle on 
none	 the boat we want to destroy it  marisha she also has the cloak we want  laura right so we wait until she drowns and then we take it from her  taliesin we can retrieve it from the bottom of the sea if we have to  marisha what do we know about magical items do they get destroyed by things like fire or me being  a meteor  matt generally no magical items a part of the enchantment is to make them resistant to the  general elements they endure and the reason that you find 
none	 mostly just the enchanted objects in  ancient ruins is because everything that would be destroyed by the weathering of time these items  stay relatively pristine  marisha then yes im down to fuck this shit up  laura i wonder if she hired the boat or if its hers i would hate to kill innocent crew members  taliesin i dont think theyre innocent crew members i think she had help  sam she had five killers with her when she killed those  matt you did see for the record in your scrying while there were five 
none	 that leapt down  with her there were more on the ship  sam its fine well throw them a life raft or something  liam then id like to put my vote in for the meteor  travis theyre also in the bay so they can swim to shore  liam well we can stop their retreat theyre going to be in worse shape without that boat  travis i want to send a message to the ship is all  matt the captains like what do you want me to do do you want me to head for 
none	 the ship  sam up above the ship  travis and vax rides keyleth down like dr strangelove the whole way  sam youre going to take a lot of damage  marisha he can fly  laura can you cast water breathing on us before you fly down and that way or is that going to  fuck up your spells  marisha its not a concentration spell right water breathing  matt no its not concentration  liam and it lasts a long time  laura 24 hours so just in case we end up in the water 
none	 were not fucked  taliesin we have ten people 12 people  travis last song request we destroy the ship right it burbling and they all burbling come  up to the top they got to go one place which is where the shore so why dont we wait on the shore  marisha well do we want to drop your ass off on the shore  travis oh yeah i mean id love to be a welcoming party im just saying if anyone else  wants to come with thats where i know theyll be going  taliesin im 
none	 hoping to take care of this before the ship even sinks  laura i can be death from above on the broom  marisha this is my favorite plan weve come up with in a long time  sam we should probably make sure that this is the right boat  laura yes yes we need to double check that this is actually the boat  marisha does this look like the right boat  matt youre a little ways from it are you going to wait until you get closer  travis is there a telescope on this ship 
none	  matt there is one that youve been using  laura can you cast a spell just in case shit happens as soon as we get close enough to the ship  marisha dispel  laura no the spell the breathing spell  marisha oh yeah whats our eta captain  matt at this speed id say 20 minutes  marisha ill wait ten minutes because i like to milk my time  matt all right ten minutes go by who is keeping watch through the telescope  laura me  matt all right make a perception check  sam 
none	 wait but keyleth knows what the boat looks like  laura she told me all about it  marisha yeah  laura 25  matt 25 all right youre scanning across looking at the ship the sails are up it is  anchored and there are maybe four individuals who are currently playing cards on the upper deck  laura it looks like the boats been docked there for a while  matt you also notice scanning the area it catches your eye theres a very lazy very faint  trail that looks like smoke on the shore of the 
none	 cshaped bay on the eastern side of the island  laura a camp on the shoreline  matt that might be a source for the smoke  laura is it close by the boat  matt if youre looking from your perspective this is the eastern side and it has this cshaped  bay right here where this is the shoreline the ship is docked right about here in the water its  surrounded by a reef its barely made its way in there and it cant go any further without hitting  reef the smoke is right there its 
none	 right on the beach side  travis can we see the other side of the island or the water on the other side from this vantage point  matt no not from this vantage point  laura can you scry and see if shes still underwater or if shes camping because i see smoke  sam can keyleth look through the we have a telescope of some sort  matt there is a telescope yeah  sam can she look and see if the boat looks right did you see any identifying marks on the boat  taliesin its not 
none	 like theres going to be a dozen of them out here  liam it would be a very big coincidence  marisha i look through the telescope does it look like the same boat  matt perception check  marisha i rolled an 18 so 29  matt yes this is very much the boat size color shape placement this is the same ship  travis thought we were getting ready to kill a cruise ship  marisha okay so am i scrying  laura well i guess you dont need to now  sam wed know if shes still 
none	 underwater or if shes on land  laura theres people on the boat waiting still  matt you are ten minutes from getting there it takes ten minutes to cast scrying  travis no we dont need it  laura but you should probably cast breathing  marisha it takes me 30 seconds to scry once i get there  sam lets scry  marisha im going to scry  laura but cast breathing on us first  marisha im going to cast water breathing and then im going to scry  taliesin wait can you do me a favor 
none	  marisha im dishing them out im the magic atm right now what do you want  taliesin once were somewhat in the distance fire an eyeball and get a good look at that ship  i want to see if its a trap you have an arrow  laura yes i do once we get close enough  marisha okay so i go to everybody and i say you have water breathing you have water breathing  and everyone has water breathing then i go everyone leave me alone for ten minutes i drop  down and i scry 
none	  matt okay so you begin concentrating as you guys get closer and closer to the ship you can now see  it getting closer and closer  travis do we want to raise our elevation as were getting closer  sam yeah we told him to go up above it  matt you guys begin to notice you vex as youre looking through the people who were  playing cards start moving on the deck of the ship they start scattering  laura are they seeing us  matt they have seen you youre not a hard vision to 
none	 see once they pay attention  laura do they look like theyre looking over the sides of the boat  matt roll a perception check  sam this is like the hindenburg flying up to a rowboat  laura 20  matt no  laura no they dont look like theyre looking over the side of the boat  matt no okay youre starting to get closer and closer you watch as they all scatter into the  bottom of the boat except for one who stands on the deck you watch launching sound this one  sparkle of bright 
none	 red arcane energy fizzing up into the sky explosion  sam a flare  matt with a dull burst exploding sound and then vanishes the explosion dissipates  laura yeah its a flare  sam to warn the people on land  matt another one fizzing  laura okay okay shit  sam how do we get to land quickly  laura i can fly there on my broom but i dont fly very quickly  taliesin are we close enough that one of her arrows can make it  matt no youre about three minutes out now from approaching 
none	 it  travis the ship or the shore  matt the ship  sam we should split some should go to the beach some should continue with plan drop keyleth  travis im going to the beach i cant yeah  sam how are you getting to the beach you cant fly  travis oh  taliesin once were close enough you can port them down  sam i can make you a thing that flies to get you there  travis what kind of thing  sam i dont know giant eagle  travis you worry about other stuff 
none	  laura a pterodactyl  travis that sounds like our only option yeah  laura three more minutes of scrying still maybe the scrying was illtimed  matt two minutes  sam all right grog you and me come on lets go  laura oh jeez i ready the broom i get on the broom and wait  taliesin prepare im telling the men prepare the harpoons it may be a trap  matt understood man the harpoons you see they all run off to the various the three different  dragon arbalist stations  taliesin prepare for a hard 
none	 turn to shore if they begin to show any signs of magical attack  matt understood you can now see the captains gone into war mode now hes keeping focus forward  as hes pushing the ship  travis how do we communicate with the captain once were off the ship should we give him an  earring  sam it wont reach its too far grog i can make you a thing that flies should i all right  i make him a giant eagle using polymorph i cant do it to me though so youre on your own 
none	  laura well you can hop on his back  sam oh yeah good call  travis im a bigass eagle  matt second time now the wings flare out and you remember oh flying im smarter your  flowers for algernon moment comes in the form of a feathered bird  liam a2  b2  c2  travis no it doesnt  matt scanlan you have to rush to get there because hes almost completely taken aback by the  moment and goes to fly you catch him barely as he leaps off the side of the ship 
none	 you guys head  off toward the  travis in a wide arc  taliesin i tell the captain no matter what happens use your judgment with any man or sailor  who wishes to parlay and come aboard but if any woman attempts to come on board you do not  recognize as one of us kill her kill her immediately  travis what if shes looking like nothing but a  laura anybody that comes on board lock them up immediately  taliesin at the very least  sam and kill them  taliesin check for a fake 
none	 arm and remove it  matt loud and clear  laura i tell trinket to hop in the necklace because were going to be traveling very quickly dear  matt into the necklace  taliesin im trying to use the scope on my big on bad news to see if anything interesting is  happening on the deck can i see the person who was firing the flares  matt the person thats now fired three flares is now running below the deck  taliesin all right theyre all below the deck  matt seemingly everybody is below the deck 
none	 right now yes  taliesin its a trap lets move away from the ship move toward the beach  sam but weve got to sink the ship  taliesin were going to sink this ship from a distance  laura shes still scrying we can they might be by the ship  taliesin i tell them to turn turn now  matt aye aye  laura i shoot the arrow and try to get to the boat the oracle arrow  matt the ship suddenly begins to list very heavily to the left side all the hands grab hold  
none	 who are currently stationed at the various elements you can see things on the deck ropes  and various odds and ends pieces of metal coins all begin drifting to one side some tumbling over  into the ocean below you all hold on tight as you pull around the side keyleth i need you to make  a concentration check  laura oh come on  matt im giving you advantage because it isnt a huge issue constitution saving throw  sam what are they going to do they dont have anything that can fight us theyre deck hands 
none	  taliesin why are they down below theres no hiding in the middle of the ocean thats a death  sentence  marisha okay 13  matt youre fine as its turning all of a sudden your eyes flare open with vision so this  is not with the journal correct  taliesin shes still got my gun  matt so whats your spell dc 19 plus okay as the ship lists your vision flashes and for a  second your vision focuses on ripleys face you see a spark of blue energy similar to the inside  of the 
none	 cloak that you saw the first time with your vision the spell kicks out  marisha son of a bitch  laura was it underwater can you at least tell that much  matt no  laura fuck good times  matt you find yourself sliding  liam are we above the ship at the moment  marisha i grab vax for safety  matt all right you guys hold on the ship turns a very quick turn heading toward the shore  taliesin we are weve got two fliers im going to i think its time were going to 
none	 attack them  if we can with the bolts if thats possible  matt if you give them the order they will  marisha percy i can destroy that ship if we get over it  liam i think we should still go  matt are we firing what do you need  liam keyleth you ready lets go  taliesin lets fire  marisha i go with vax  taliesin theyre going to go im going to fire on the ship fire on the ship  matt fire he yells out you watch as the arbalists all pull back 
dung	 arrows releasing as  they release it they have these giant hard dark iron bolts that are loaded into these as they  release them they go traveling through the dragons mouth the dragons mouth bursts into  flame and lights the bolts into arcane fire all launch off and arc downward one of them misses  splashing into the water but two go slamming into the side of the ship you see wood  splintering you see flames begin to crawl along the side while both of you what are you doing  marisha im holding on to him 
none	 piggyback ride style  liam im on your back or piggyback arent you going earth elemental  marisha i got to get over the ship i cant fly as an earth elemental  liam here we go  matt all right as shes saying this you leap off wings go out coasting down over the ship you  begin to glide under as you can see the explosions they begin loading up the second round  of assault on the ship you arc around keeping her on your back you guys are coming down toward  the ship you now 
none	 watch as another volley two miss but a third one hits another splinter of  various pieces of the ship bow torn asunder  marisha i wait until he gets me over top of the boat as soon as he gets me over top  matt you coast up on the side you watch as one of the three large masts begins to slowly fall  over from the impact of the various assaults from the ship you are now up over the ship itself  liam you ready to do this  marisha nice and high nice and high 
none	  liam all right were going to twist in the air here we go  matt as this is happening you see one of them has come over from inside of the ship and is  watching this attack happen you can barely see he looks harried but he looks up and releases  marisha i let go were over the boat  matt you guys are over the boat now yes  taliesin is there any way i could have gotten any of this in my scope  matt you know what yes well make a perception check first 
none	 actually to see if youve seen this  liam as were twisting in the air i cast bless on keyleth and myself  matt make a concentration check because you are flying a constitution saving throw  liam 18 that means that you and i whenever we make an attack roll or a saving throw for the next  minute add a d4  taliesin 14  matt 14 you can make the attack itll be at disadvantage because of the distance this is with  bad news i assume  taliesin yes  matt so disadvantage on the attack 
none	 are you using any grit or anything  taliesin not cool im already shaky today yeah you know what ill use a grit to deadeye the  shot to cancel out the disadvantage  matt all right go ahead and make your roll  laura who are you shooting  sam the guy on deck who just went like this  laura oh i thought he already ran under  matt no he came up onto the deck to do something he barely saw and hes taking a shot  taliesin thats not bad 24  matt 24 hits go 
none	 ahead  liam bullet cam  taliesin let me find the correct dice for this 23 points of piercing damage  matt the individual reaches up and you see a burst of electrical energy fire up in the  direction of both of you right as head shot on the side of the skull sending him face down and  bleeding onto the now raging fire that is the top of this ship both of you guys have advantage on a  dexterity saving throw  marisha wait what  taliesin he still got a shot off but it went 
none	 wild  marisha natural 20  liam and i have a 28  matt all right so both of you take 14 points of lightning damage as the lightning bolt barely  skims past you vax you scooting off your wings burned by the electrical impact but youre off to  the side keyleth youre now in freefall over the ship  liam can i use evasion  matt yeah go for it  liam so thats if i succeed the dex yeah its every turn  matt seven  liam it halves it right  matt it was 14 
none	 because you made the save and then seven  marisha i blow vax a kiss and then i go earth elemental i light up my flaming hands and then i  go keyteor  liam see you later  matt your keyteor as you coined it is now this ball of condensed rock a trail of flame behind  it whistling crashing slams into the ship i want you to go ahead and roll 6d6 points of  damage plus a d4  marisha 6d6 theres got to be one more for this dont fuck me  liam how do 
none	 you even know which ones you rolled it looks like 80 dice  marisha well all of them 21 plus one oh wait 22 plus do i roll my flame hands  matt yes you do  marisha 27  matt boom you punch through the upper deck of the ship smack through the central deck of the  ship and slam into the base splintering wood but the actual bottom of the ship is still intact  however from the impact and everything thats going on the flames trail through and begin to  burn you see as looking 
none	 down at you one of the crewmen who was underneath is now a pulp beneath  your elemental feet another one is now scrambling back up to the top amidst the chaos  marisha i get up and i say sorry  matt as you pull your foot out water begins to pour inside apparently your feet punched through  and now its beginning to quickly splashing sounds waters beginning to pour out of the  ocean and fill the bottom of the ship  marisha i tell the guys above swim to shore  matt it sounds loud gravelly 
none	 gibberish theyre like yelling  laura while this is happening can i have taken a flying run off of the airship and started flying  toward the smoke the campfire  matt you dart off with the broom underneath and scoot off toward the bay you guys have made your  way flying down on eaglegrogback to the beach coasting up to the side you can see as you scoot  across to the top about ten feet up all the jagged broken glass that is this beach it is  similar to the broken burnt ground of the cindergrove 
none	 except its all sharp its not fun  you come around and make a perception check grog with your bonus i think you have advantage on  this because youre a giant eagle let me double check really fast im pretty sure giant eagle  you have advantage on perception checks so yeah roll twice  travis same number and do i get a bonus on the  matt well your wisdom is plus two  travis 15  matt 15 as youre coming along you do see there appears to be some semblance of a smoldering  fire that 
none	 is giving off a hint of a trail of smoke theres a couple of things on the ground  around it and there are two small boats that are up against up on the shore they look like little  skiffs or paddle boats that probably belong to the ship  travis i fly over im going to make a low buzz over the campfire but keep going along the beach  not landing at the boat or the fire  matt you keep going vex you see the eagle swoop past with scanlan on the back are you heading 
none	 to  catch up with them  laura yeah  matt okay so you guys have vex coming and meeting up alongside you guys now as youre  flying and coasting from the side you see this broomriding vex lean forward go over and give  you a wink from the side as you begin heading along the upper coast the curvature of the beach  heading towards the east  taliesin vax keyleth search the ship take anything you think might be hers  liam how far am i from percival on the airship  matt youve probably looped 
none	 around and youre probably halfway between the ship which is now  heading back toward the shore and the boat on the ground that is now both masts are now in complete  flames the sail is on fire two of the crewmen the two crewmen who havent really been hurt  have jumped off the sides and are now swimming through the water you can see their trail behind  them the one who was shot in the head you cant see through the flames it wasnt enough to kill  him that wasnt however the whole ship is 
none	 on fire now the one that you impacted with is a  mess keyleth  liam then im beelining straight through the air towards percival  taliesin stay with keyleth check the ship  marisha i crush everything  taliesin search the ship keyleth search it  matt make an investigation check  marisha me  matt yeah you can still hear him hes telling you this through your earring  taliesin take the captains quarters you can breathe underwater tear it apart as its going down  matt as an earth elemental roll an investigation minus three because your 
none	 intelligence is five you  are dumber than grog as an earth elemental  marisha natural 20 theres no reason that should have happened  matt i agree as water is filling the bottom and youre not very good at treading water in this  form youre sinking with the ship pretty much its burbling noises thankfully you can breathe  water because you still have the enchantment on you glancing around you do see what amounts to a  bunch of notes papers that are all soaked in water that you palm with your elemental hand and  you 
none	 keep it there grab a couple and you now have two fists filled with papers you dont know what  they are or whats on them you cant even read in this form technically but youre now underwater  and the ship is breaking and falling you can watch as the flames above the glow is growing  dimmer as the water is beginning to take the fire its slowly falling into the bay  taliesin start walking to the beach keyleth get to the beach  marisha yeah i guess i start toward the beach well thats going to 
none	 take a long time the ship is  sinking right  matt yeah youre probably now the ship is probably 30 feet below the surface and falling  you with it  marisha im going to drop my form  matt okay youre back into keyleth form and immediately the lack of mass the ship begins to  fall below you as you keep buoyancy now the hole that you broke through is now this opening that  you can swim up to get out of the wreckage of the ship  marisha okay i take all the papers and 
none	 i shove them in a pocket and im going to cast control  water im going to shoot myself up and out  matt like a waterspout you watch as keyleth is jettisoned out of the ocean and then begins to  lightly surf along the surface standing  laura percy  taliesin yes  laura make sure the airship stays far away from these boats i dont want ripley having any access  to the airship  sam on the beach were going around along the beach is there a tree line  matt the tree line is further 
none	 inland maybe about 300 feet inland most of the open glass shore is  on the eastern and southern side on the north and northwestern side is where the mountain is and  the jungle surrounds most of the mountain and a lot of the western side of the island  sam i shout down to grog i dont think shes on the beach man its all glass we should go  inland  travis we turn inland  matt okay you guys go ahead and take off inland  liam am i closing on percy  matt youre making 
none	 your way toward the ship yeah the ship is faster than you  liam oh really  matt yes  liam i click my boots of haste then i can go 500 feet in a round  matt 500 feet  liam 480 yeah if i use double dash yeah action action  matt well your flying speed is what 60  liam i mean i did the math at one point i know its 480 feet my speed flying is 60  matt you can dash as a bonus action right  liam as a bonus action yeah but 
none	 if im hasted its doubled so its 60 its 120 action  action bonus action so 120 plus 120 and then bonus action i can also dash i dont know  matt you can catch up to the ship with haste yes so you click your boots of haste and all of a  sudden your wings the feathers themselves almost thin out they retract in you become less of a  bird and more of a bullet coasting forward at a downward arc you eventually catch up to the back  outer side of the airship as its bearing 
none	 down on the smoke spiral and the innermost part of the bay  beach line  liam im going to pick you up you haughty prick and i reach out my arms and grab him from behind  matt okay you almost drop bad news at the sudden impact but you grab it and hold on to it as  youre lifted up again over the air another uncomfortable height experience youve had a  couple of these recently but its swift enough to the point and not prolonged to the point where  youre able to keep yourself in 
none	 check you begin to carry him down  liam barrel roll and follow my sister  matt okay so now all of you guys are this loose squadron along the beach line as you watch they  turn off and begin to head toward the tree line  laura can i get a closer look at the campsite  matt youd probably have to stop and inspect it if you want  laura is there anybody that i can see around it from above  matt make a perception check  laura yes 30 then  matt from what you 
none	 can see the campsite the fire has the smoldering element that from your  experience with campfires means its probably been burning for anywhere from four to five hours  and is towards the end of its life whatever wood was in there is on the very very last cinders  there appear to be some elements in detail some heavy movement right around it in the shoreline  there theres a little bit of silt that has washed up onto the glass so right next to the  waterline there is still a meeting of underwater dirt and silt 
none	 and where the glass begins to take  over and you can see a bunch of shifting in that area but youre too far away to make out any  details but other than that you dont see any hint of people or life around that site  travis can scanlan and i make a loop heading towards the tree line and then stop id say 100  feet from where the water hits the shore  matt okay so you head to the tree line and then you stop about 100 feet out about halfway between  the shore 
none	 and the tree line  travis right yeah not all the way  matt you hit there and you end up stopping whooshing land and you land in the one area  where it appears the least painful to land on now for all intents and purposes this entire  landscape is considered rough terrain so your speed is halved you can run full speed if you  want but you will take damage in doing so  liam ugh lego its all made of little legos  matt kind of yeah so you land scanlan youre on the back 
none	 of grog and youre now standing in the  center of this open beach area  sam im scanning around for any footprints or anything  travis as hes scanning i peck him in the shoulder  sam ow ow fuck ow  marisha so weve all convened on the shore at this point  matt you see them land a little ways up from the shore vex are you landing with them  laura no i wanted to fly down a little closer and see if i can see any footprints and see where  they lead  matt
