none	 but well go into those details shortly so see you  in a little bit  dramatic music  travis right listen up if you have ale then you have a friend in grog strongjaw a goliath of  towering height and size this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life  combat women and ale chuckle  record scratch wait  easily the brains of the group grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes  colors and chuckle shiny things  also ale  in his early years armed with his 
none	 twohanded great axe grog often enjoyed proving his might  amongst the ranks of his familys wandering herd but after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly  gnome in the woods he objected to the killing of such an innocent life a creature of impulse grog  felt only pity for this well this terrified little thing and his disobedience  cost him dearly  beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader his uncle kevdak grog was abandoned and left to die  exiled from his herd it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to 
none	 save  saved him it was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike that healed grog bringing him back  from deaths edge and they have remained close friends ever since  most nights grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches ha or accompanying  scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors  also ale  marisha a first impression of keyleth would leave you with little information on the halfelven  druid you might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is  kind of sweet chuckle 
none	  of course it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions thunder under that  unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose natural powers have  made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants literally soft chuckle  born to the air tribe of the ashari people keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and  the elemental magics it is her peoples inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in taldorei  where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm  since she was a 
none	 little girl she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities  well if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts which i do clears throat  anyways it wasnt long before the headmaster of the tribe her father korren realized her true  prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster  just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization  teachings from ancient traditions and exceedingly high expectations every druid leader to be must  embark on a journey to seek 
none	 out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst  the fellow headmasters they call this the aramente or noble odyssey when her father felt  she was ready he set her on the path to truly discovering herself not knowing when or if she  will ever return  as she hiked down the mountain towards stillben she meditated on the task ahead part of the  aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior a valiant protector and a wise and compassionate  leader with this knowledge one thought plays on repeat in her mind is 
dung	 she even worthy  taliesin percy was the third of seven children born to a noble family who lived far to the north  in the ancient castle of whitestone with so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship percy  turned his attentions to the sciences engineering and naturalism  one day a mysterious couple named lord and lady briarwood came to court during a feast held in  their honor the briarwoods violently took control of the castle killing or imprisoning everyone who  would stand in their way  percy awoke chained in the dungeon only 
none	 to be freed by his younger sister together they fled  chased by the briarwoods men as they ran percys sister took several arrows to the chest  and fell percy kept running eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to  freedom he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat he barely remembered the next two  years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible  then one night percy had a dream a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who  destroyed his family when he awoke 
town	 percy began to design his first gun gunshot  ashley pike grew up on the outskirts of town near the bramblewood her ancestors were a family  of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation thievery destruction and trickery  left them with the curse of the last name trickfoot sarenrae the goddess of healing and  redemption had other plans for pikes greatgreatgrandfather wilhand who left his  family at a young age after a dream a dream that changed the course of the trickfoot family  wilhand devoted his life to sarenrae and pledged from then on that 
none	 him and his family would live a  life of service and devotion  as a child pike seemed to have an affinity to heal whether it was animals people or even  flowers she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken she  studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic  she lived a peaceful life quiet and simple until one day wilhand was captured and almost killed by  a group of goliath barbarians one of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent  
none	 gnome and he himself was beaten bloodied and left for dead abandoned by his herd wilhand went  to pike for help she prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could bringing him  back to life  when he awoke she discovered his name was grog strongjaw after that they were the best of friends  a rather unlikely pair little did she know that in a few years time grog would soon return the  favor and bring her back from the clutches of death roar crunch  after being killed in battle pike felt angry she 
none	 wanted to be stronger so that it would never  happen again she spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship  called the broken howl  gripping her holy symbol in one hand and her morningstar in the other this time  pike is ready  sam oh you havent heard of scanlan shorthalt well gird your loins ladies because he has his  eye on you  a talented musician master of disguise and dashingly handsome in his own mind scanlan sings  songs almost as much as he sings his own 
town	 praises  born a poor gnome scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and  support his single mother one day he was discovered by a halforc promoter and joined dr  dranzels spectacular traveling troupe where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills  as a bard extraordinaire  a loner much of his life scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother  at the hands of a goblin invasion while his years on the road provided many shall we say  
town	 educational experiences with the opposite sex deep down scanlan yearns for the one thing hes  never known the true love of a fellow gnome  still scanlan considers himself a lover first performer second and fighter distant third on  the battlefield hell support his allies but rarely draws blood unless its to protect fellow  gnome pike  count on scanlan for a hearty laugh a rollicking song and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts  and makes the females swoon  orion greetings and salutations i am tiberius stormwind i hail from a town called 
none	 tyrex  located in the heart of draconia  from a politically respected family at the age of 15 i succeeded in passing the sorcerers rite  showing prodigylike control of my magic the judges and the draconian high council were amazed  at how powerful my spells were for how long i had been training at 20 years old i was the youngest  appointed member of the magic guild in draconian history for the next few years i almost went mad  from the malaise of being a guild member as its rather boring  however one day 
none	 i happened upon a chamber unused for quite some time in the room were stacks of  books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world for months i would  frequent the chamber and learned of artifacts from legend  after a long period of research i made a list of artifacts that caught my eye i brought these  findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber i had stumbled  upon was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries and hence were lost forever 
town	  i found those answers to be unacceptable  a year later i devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me  leaving draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms going from  town to town and making friends and allies in and for the name of draconia being a red dragonborn  i had quite the task on my hands in that respect but it was exactly what i needed so i could  explore the world and find these artifacts as i felt the truth was 
none	 out there  some may describe me as buffoonish but i say poppycock to all that i am much sharper than most  give me credit for i just dont pay attention to things sometimes ive also been known to be  rather cunning loyal happygolucky and well dangerous i cant help but show my true scales  every now and then but overall i think im quite friendly for a dragonborn  liam never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men vaxildan learned at a young age to  skip past formality preferring instead to invite himself 
town	 in your door  along with twin sister vexahlia vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human  peasantry raised by their mother in their early years the twins were eventually sent off to their  father in the elven capital of syngorn but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed  and their time in the capital didnt last the siblings stole away one autumn night and set out  on the open road  after a few years of wandering they eventually decided to return to their mother and journeyed  back 
none	 to the lands of their youth but instead of finding their childhood home they returned to a  pile of rubble their mother was gone their home burned to ash pressing the townspeople for  answers they learned of the day the dragon came roar with their ties all severed vaxildan and  his sister set out to find their fortune together in taldorei  an outsider since birth vax quickly learned to solve lifes challenges in his own particular way  often by sidestepping them entirely and when his knack for circumventing adversity isnt enough  knife scraping the 
none	 way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes  up the difference  laura like so many halfelves vexahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool  reception of a people who dont fully accept her born of a human mother and an elven father who  only later in life took an interest in their existence vexahlia and her twin brother  vaxildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world  were each other  it was at the age of ten when the two were taken from 
none	 their mother and brought to live in syngorn  the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador he quietly took them in but always  kept an icy distance and after too many years of disdainful looks the pair decided to leave his  indifference behind and set out on their own  vax took to the cities stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief while vex kept  to the woods she preferred the isolation  always the keen observer she learned to hunt and to track to spy and to shoot and 
none	 through a  series of fateful events earned herself a companion in the form of a bear her own stolen  trinket to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely  also he is adorable and gives expert massages  dramatic music  matt hello guys welcome back thank you for your patience we have the whole group finally  seem to have defeated the horrible atrocity that is 13thlevel los angeles traffic  cheering  zac whats up internet ive got a quick announcement  matt yes  zac guys we have a big giveaway today when we get

dung	 folk hero a  paladin of bahamut who had been captured and tortured by the duergar that lived beneath it  after saving her they discovered that there was an even deeper darker more dangerous evil  brewing beneath the surface there was an illithid or mind flayer city of yugvoril deeper  within these cavern structures and currently the elder brain of the colony was under the control of  an entity known as kvarn they came to find out was a selfmutilated and advanced beholder who had  come into contact with a dark artifact known as the 
none	 horn of orcus that was actually gifted many  many many many like hundreds of years ago by the god of undeath himself orcus to one of his  avatars somehow it found its way to this beholder and gave it enough power to where it  gained complete dominion over this colony and these caverns as a whole the party fought their  way through and made a few allies including the ousted mind flayer clarota seeking to return to  his colony has been fighting alongside them as well as lady kima the paladin they came to save 
none	  upon finding their way into the final cavern they used their magic carpet to completely go around  the giant city of yugvoril perch on top of the temple in the center of the city and using a  polymorphed fomorian giant laughs cascading down hundreds upon hundreds of feet through the  glass structure on top managed to break their way into the temple after which a very dangerous  battle with kvarn the beholder took place a number of very close calls i posted the stats for  them after the fight if any of you guys 
none	 got a chance to see it they made saving throws where it  counted or wed have a lot more party members thatd be permanently dead but they managed to  take him out using tiberiuss telekinesis they tore the horn from its forehead and the beholder  fell to the ground unmoving and finally killed as opposed to its undead form and thats where we  begin as you guys all sit there looking around yourselves adrenaline still pumping in your ears  the flow of blood  orion pike  ashley thats me what do you need  
none	 orion do you have spell of restoration the thing that can reverse stone  ashley yes i do  orion clarota what do you suggest we do do we stay do we leave or do we what do you there  are hundreds upon thousands of illithid rushing at us right now and they dont like me very much by  the way  laura we should get out of here  matt at which point clarota turns to you and says you bring her points to kima who is  still frozen in stone midwielding her maul  ashley 
none	 to carry her  matt stay but a moment i will talk to them  sam talk to the hive  orion very good wait do you want her unstoned or still stoned  marisha well hang on maybe before we unstone kima we talk about what we should  do with the horn  orion this is exactly what has to do with the horn is there any way pike could you perhaps  halfcast it and hold the spell dont quite undo her legs from stone i dont want her to be  mobile i want to ask 
none	 her  ashley i dont know if i  sam if i may very quickly are you with us tiberius  orion we will discuss that when we get out of here  sam because you disappeared for like the whole fight are you with us  orion i am with you  sam are you going to disappear again  orion to be fair scanlan i never disappeared to begin with  sam well you werent there when we needed you the most you were out doing godknowswhat  orion quite the contrary if it wasnt for me youd 
none	 still be fighting that damn thing  sam what on earth are you talking about  orion silence  laughter  sam dispel magic yes i did  orion counterspell  sam do i have a will save  orion no youre done youre quiet  matt that low enough level no unfortunately  orion the idea which i will share we dont have time to do that  sam i turn him into a goat  orion he has to say that it doesnt work  matt i know that  laughter  orion so the idea is pike 
none	 if we ask her why she wants the horn if there is any other reason but  to destroy it we have to  sam okay then ill banish him  laura gasps  ashley how about well hold on  taliesin he cant stop it he cant talk  matt also requires verbal casting  sam i have to touch him right  matt you also have to be able to speak  sam fuck  matt so while youre talking to them scanlan is tapping you and mouthing words angrily  orion the idea is if she doesnt 
none	 want to destroy it i say theres something awful and keyleth i  believe you want to destroy it yes  marisha well yes i mean why does she want to take it back up to the surface  if its that terrible  orion i know this is did you say orcus is that his name  matt orcus yes  orion this thing is no good at all  marisha why dont we just throw it in some lava  orion where is some lava i would much like to do that  marisha well were around lava 
none	 right  travis we were  laura were not around lava now  taliesin its a thing of earth perhaps taking it to the surface is necessary to destroy it why  dont we have a conversation with her  orion but she wanted to take it back to emon that is not appropriate we need to destroy this  taliesin lets get some information first  orion i dispel silence  matt okay  taliesin lets get some information lets figure out  sam oh hi hi there  orion sorry i just wanted to get the point across 
none	  ashley i can unstone her  taliesin well unstone her its not like she can take it from us  ashley thats my last 5thlevel spell so we might need to rest  taliesin if something horrible happens were going to run anyway at this point  matt i assume you guys have come down in here then  orion im staying up can i not  sam then how did we have this whole conversation  orion oh then id be down there  laura i was planning on staying up im not leaving trinket up there  
none	 matt okay good  taliesin why dont we find out what happens next and if we have to you can teleport us out of  here correct  orion oh i have a wonderful escape plan  marisha okay so clarota how much time do we have before something happens next  matt as you say that clarota turns and the two stone doorways on each side of the temple shift  open and you notice three mind flayers glide in from the side of the room  laura i notch my arrow  orion no no stop no dont 
none	 its fine its fine its fine  matt two small bipedal brainlike creatures  all no no  matt at which point clarota puts his hands up like this  travis im grappled so  matt yeah youre still being held back but you can try to break from the grapple if you want to  roll an athletics check  travis laughs i would like to just because these things ate my fucking mind away seven  matt nope youre still held against the bars  taliesin youre like an extra in big trouble in little china  travis 
none	 oh its a 12 i looked at acrobatics  matt still not enough unfortunately  ashley wait but i cast nope never mind keep going  matt okay as they begin to move in and are hovering forward looking around the room taking  in the scenery but theyre all focused toward the center theyre all just moving towards the elder  brain and they make their way up towards it looking very intent and very frightened at the  prospect of what maybe has happened in this room as they all approach you can see that low dull  
none	 kind of purplish glow of the elder brain is still pumping but slowly brighter and brighter almost  like its coming to more life you can hear the cage rattling of the various entities that are  still inside like the one thats still grappling grog off to the side the horn of orcus which is  still being held aloft by your telekinesis spell is just hovering through the air slowly rotating  on its own little strips of kvarns flesh still freshly tumbling from the side  orion and its at the halfway point between where she is 
none	 and where im standing  matt so right here  orion yeah right there  matt not this big of course  orion its really heavy guys  matt as they all move towards the center clarota with his hands up turns around pulls  back the hood and steps towards the other mind flayers hands stretched out moving up to the  point here  ashley whispers can you instill an inspiration  sam inspire him i think hes pretty good on his own  orion dont do anything im saying this on the ears  matt the three 
none	 illithid look over and notice clarota and theres a good 20 or 30 seconds of  silence as they just look at each other at which point clarota kind of turns around to the rest of  the group and looks at them looks at all of you and lowers his head a little bit as the mind  flayers move in towards clarota one reaches over and pulls the cap from the back of his head  removes it at which point clarota raises up and if you think youve ever seen an entity with  tentacles for a 
none	 mouth smile the creases in his awful rubbery fleshy face almost give a look of  joy of rediscovered connection and he looks out to the rest of you and bows a head for a second  i need grog scanlan tiberius vax and pike to all make  travis tiberius if he fucks us  sam i think hes about to  matt intelligence saving throws  travis oh im grappled im raging but fuck yes intelligence saving throws  matt intelligence saving throws  travis thank god i rolled high  orion natural 20  travis laughs i

none	 once including clarota angrily lash out with a  mind blast you feel your brains all of a sudden fill with searing horrible pain some of you  manage to shrug it off but the rest of you find your bodies locking in place all right everyone  who failed their save which would be keyleth whatd you roll  marisha you didnt have me roll  matt oh you need to roll as well sorry youre in the blast there youre still  an earth elemental  marisha i thought i was immune to this kind of stuff groans 
none	 what do i not good  matt not good all right thatll be 22 points of psychic damage to grog to pike  travis i passed right  matt no you passed this youre fine  laura teleport us out of here  orion it doesnt work like that its what i was trying to say earlier  matt scanlan you are currently stunned you are actually unable to physically move pike as well  the rest of you manage to resist the mind blast but at this point in time you can now see that  this crew including

none	 hail of thorns down into the elder brain go ahead and roll for  the attack  laura 19  matt 19 will hit yes  sam were going to be dead in ten minutes  matt what the teleportation one  orion well talk about it later plan b its ten minutes  matt one minute  orion sure  matt pretty sure its one minute  marisha wait does this mean you can go and well distract  orion no dont look at it you said one minute thats the dm dm is god  laura do i

none	 over them and the elder brain  the pulsing begins to you hear this shrieking in your mind like the actual presence of the elder  brain is starting to yell out in pain you feel its hardy but hurting i mean its very hefty  its a large chunk of matter so god knows how long it would take to take that one down but its  definitely laughs it hurt its not happy with that do you want to move at all or do you want to  stay where you are  laura i want to do

none	 you could hear if you could hear laughter come from  something that is inanimate youre hearing it coming from the horn right now  travis fuck that horn  matt thats your action  orion im going to  laura float it into the bag of holding  orion im going to maneuver around the chaos because im not within range of anybody to hurt  me right  matt not currently no  orion so im going to hop on the carpet  liam this is all taking six seconds by the way  matt 30 thats as

none	 does just hit  liam thats a sneak attack because shes next to him theres nothing in the rule book about  stunned or unconscious or anything  matt how sneak attack works is if theyre next to someone thats aggressive toward them they feel  like they have people on two fronts which is why you get the benefit  taliesin he is to be fair very occupied  matt i will say circumstantially though because he is currently grappled on to pike and is in the  process of trying to grind into her brain with his mouth 
none	 he is a little preoccupied at the moment  travis hes sucking head  matt so im going to go ahead and make a perception roll versus your fast movement go  ahead and make a stealth roll stealth to see whether or not he takes notice and changes his  position in defense  liam i rolled a 24  matt okay go ahead the first attack you rolled was a 15 that hits  liam okay thank you  matt and that is a sneak attack he did not see you coming that quickly  liam all right

none	 the ice just slowly melts away yeah theres some damage dealt to  it but this is a hardy sack of hit points and its coming online so with the end of your turn  the brain now taken a bunch of hits begins to pulse with energy now that its been freed from  its control and its slowly brought itself out of this trancelike slumber that it was placed in by  kvarn the elder brain is now becoming conscious once again  liam oh dear  taliesin can we go up there can you put us at 
none	 our height now  laughter  marisha can you represent us accurately  matt so at a 30foot radius which you guys are it gives off a pulse of energy boomf this giant  psychic burst of purpleish psychic blast just cascades out of the center and just fills the room  for a second with this large dull thudlike thoom sound all of you instinctively look down  and see this explosion that just dissipates as it crests the bottom of the magic carpet which is  just out of range  taliesin youre wearing the helmet at least 
none	  matt at which point you guys who are at the top looking off to the side all the illithid that are  rushing up the tunnel theres a sudden flash of purple energy in their eyes simultaneously like  now the elder brain has come back online and has reconnected with its people  laura out out out  matt all right that brings us to grog grog  travis i can keep flying up  matt all of the sudden the rope is really easy to go up its nothing youre just going hand  over hand

none	 well he has to wait for the carpet  sam the brain is down there in the puddle in the pool is that big scaffolding still  hanging over it  matt its currently dangling over to this side because its been busted from three different  corners and its precariously hanging  sam but its not right over the thing  laura but it might fall and tip  sam or it could not  ashley could somebody also use telekinesis to pull it to fall the other way  orion i do not have the necessary item to 
none	 do two concentration spells at once  sam is it super heavy  matt its pretty heavy it probably weighs close to 700 to 1000 pounds  marisha what does  matt the giant brass structure  sam and how high above it is it like would it get a significant amount of force  matt it would fall down and then topple over  sam unless i made it fall  matt unless you made it fall in that case well see  sam do i do that or do i just lightning strike okay  liam its your

none	 plus what  matt 13 plus five which is your charisma  sam okay then 18  matt 18 as the spectral bigbys hand reaches over and grabs the top of the structure you can  see the weird bit of bent metal that was once part of the mostlydestroyed structure that held it  aloft in the center of the temple metal creaking wrenches forth and snaps as the entire structure  begins to be pulled at an angle  sam sings its bigbys hand  matt it slams down at an angle into the side of the brain 
none	 and coming to rest on top crushing even  further the corpse of clarota currently smeared across the ground oh man go ahead and roll 6d6  force damage on that crushing damage as this heavy thing jams itself into the brain  liam six cubes sam six cubes  sam orions my dice bimbo  orion here you go boss  ashley there you go boss  sam 16  matt 16 so the structure slams into the elder brain and you can see like a bit of purplish  black liquid kinda squirts out to one side and 
none	 for the first time you can see a part of the brain is  actually torn open and the purplish glow that you see throbbing in the middle of its folds is now  visible from the interior you can see now its taken some real damage immediately the two mind  flayers that were floating up look down freaked out and begin moving towards the brain now  instinctively to defend it  sam and bonus action can i pour some superior healing potion down pikes beautiful throat  matt you can  laughter  matt im not going

none	 really really rough the brains just now  pierced with a bunch of arrows some of it its barely holding itself on top of its feet and the  troll also takes the damage as well just seems to shrug it off just seems to angrily roars up  from the bottom of the temple at you now seemingly helpless in the current circumstance  laura so then i want to attack the elder brain again  matt all right so you release it down  laura 20  matt very nice that hits go ahead and roll damage

none	 you hear  is it hitting the psychic field and pushing through into the actual brain matter  marisha come on  taliesin let me doublecheck that im doing this right hold on deadshots weird plus weapon  damage okay so thats eight nine ten 11 12 13 25 points of damage  matt 25 points of damage boom you see the section of it thats kinda charred and burned gets  blown off and now theres a corner of the brain thats just an open and gaping wound the purplish  glow on the inside is pulsing more and 
none	 more angrily its taken a beating but  its hanging in there  taliesin oh my god  marisha will not die  matt this is you guys have left a good mark on it you get the sensation with the swarming  incoming you may start to consider selfpreservation because the elder brain looks like  its taken some hits but its not on deaths door yet  taliesin oh god  marisha lets get out  laura we need to go  matt scanlan youre up  sam scanlan is up  matt yep  sam were out

none	 for trinket  matt nine for trinket  laura who is by the way my only way to get out of here right now  matt so communally both you and trinket freeze in place and trinket who is flying slumps onto  the top of the temple limply laying across the edge about to tip over off the temple  sam whispering told you we shouldve left trinket behind  matt that ends your turn keyleth youre up  marisha okay  liam a lot of sandmen in there  marisha well first and foremost im going to get 
none	 on the carpet  matt okay so you leap up here with these guys  marisha secondly i am going to okay wait trinkets stunned  matt trinket is currently catatonic moans just barely holding herself right there you can see  shes struggling with the flight spell like shes kind of levering herself into the ground  laura trinkets a boy  matt him sorry i was thinking of you  laura if hes about to die at least get his gender right  matt i apologize trinket im sorry  marisha wait shove him  taliesin shove him 
none	 onto the carpet  marisha no i cant shove him  sam wait hes floating  marisha okay can i do this okay heres what im going to do im on the carpet im going to  cast grasping vine from the carpet and wrap around trinket and have a trinket tow vine  matt okay  orion like the macys day parade  matt so as you leap onto the carpet you reach down and the fibrous nature that the carpet was  originally made from you manage to pull the essence of that out to create a vine 
none	 of similarly  patterned color of the actual magic carpet material the various silks form into this tendril  that wraps around both you and trinket and pulls you guys hanging behind the carpet so you guys  are essentially now towed to the carpet  marisha lets go  orion can she take control of the carpet too  marisha can i now use the rest of my movement to be like  matt you currently do not have control of the carpet because you used your action and everything  to use that spell and your concentration at 
none	 that point  marisha okay im just holding  matt youre just holding them there that brings us to tiberius youre off flying off pike is  off vax youre up  liam im steering us the fuck outta here man  matt you tow trinket and vex out behind as you guys pull off at full speed the rest of the  illithid swarm to the top you can see about 15 or so get to the front top here look down at the  elder brain look up at the rest of you with this angry look and 
none	 as youre pulling away your eyes  adjust to the darkness of the cavern and you look down and you swear you can see hundreds and  hundreds of sets of purple glowing eyes just staring up from the city as you all slowly fly  away to the far end of the cavern as youre moving so are the eyes  laura sings weve made some enemies theyre coming after us  orion i want to make a note because im way ahead of everybody at this point as soon as i  land on the beach i cast 
none	 circle of teleportation  matt okay  orion barring that theres nobody there but i do that immediately  matt all right so a few minutes go by you guys are moving past and over the water channel thats  between the north side of the island and the beach where you guys previously set  laughter  matt as tiberius you land on the dirt you land immediately begin casting the circle of  teleportation you begin scrawling this circle on the ground running your finger across the gravel  surface to build the runes as your fingers drag 
none	 across you can see the arcane light beginning to  glow and form the sigils and the runes as youre drawing them feverishly the rest of the group  eventually catches up to you about 30 seconds into it as you all eventually get back you and  trinket manage to shrug off the effect and you find yourselves halfway through being towed by  this vine awkwardly  laura what is happening right now  marisha stupid wrench  matt a few seconds pass you finish the incantation you place your hand down on the  center of the 
none	 sigil this wave of arcane energy blasts off and suddenly above this circle this  tearing sound pulls out of the middle of the ether and this kind of purple shimmering doorway  opens above the circle sigil that he crafted on the side of the beach  orion by the blessings of bahamut i choose emon  matt at which point the doorway that he just created takes some sort of a solid form and from  what you can see on the other side there appears to be some sort of lowlit room  liam greyskull  laura 
none	 gasps greyskull  orion i run right through  matt all right tiberius runs through everyone else  all yes  sam are we there  matt you guys have all landed on the beach as he finished casting this yeah  laura run  marisha run  matt you all rush through the portal one after the other towards the very end is grog you  bringing up the rear holding kima you go rushing towards it as it begins to slowly close this only  lasts a round you barrel through just in time as it closes behind 
none	 you with a sparking sound  taliesin we are time bandits  cheering  travis oh fuck i just caked my pants  taliesin squishsquish  laura i hate that phrase  orion that was something now wasnt it  taliesin that was fantastic  travis chocolate cake  matt you all emerge within a small 20footby20foot white stone chamber you all  are kinda crammed in this space currently but you are all apparently safe and sound as the doorway  closes behind you you turn and look and on the ground there is a similar circle across the 
none	 stone  flooring different patterns different you know arrangement to the one that he had drawn but with  some similarities that are kind of a reminiscent glow almost like a code to this circle fade  away based on what he had drawn previously  laura they wont be able to open that back up  orion we are safe  laura okay  travis just a quick request she is made of stone holding lady kima  ashley yes ill go over and cast greater restoration on kima  orion hold on just one second  travis hold 
none	 on  orion we still have the horn to deal with  taliesin the horn is on the carpet it has been specifically not touched  matt so its just kind of sitting there the carpets bunched to the side now as you guys kind  of flew into the portal and kind of left it there and the horns just resting there  orion i think we should get it out of her view before  taliesin i think we should put it in the bag of holding  travis sure yeah do you want to teleport it in 
none	 the bag  ashley if your crushing couldnt kill it the thousand pounds  orion we can store it there  liam where are we you said were in a room  matt its a small yellow room sorry a small white stone room and there is a kind of yellowish  brown stone doorway that is closed theres some very faint white orbs that are locked into the  wall so youre not in greyskull keep now  marisha oh were not in greyskull  matt you guys dont have a teleportation circle installed in your keep yet you 
none	 dont know where  you are  sam were in a room right now  matt youre in a room youre in a 20footby20foot room with two small white orbs  on the sides that are kinda set into the walls to give off a faint white arcane glow theres a  single doorway that exits the room that is currently closed  orion the way circle of teleportation works is when i learned it i get to pick two locations that  i know innately i picked emon as one of them  laura oh okay okay  marisha 
none	 so were somewhere in emon  orion but i just had to pick the two  marisha so we could be in someones living room right now  orion ill use telekinesis to lift the horn off the carpet  matt okay you still have the spells  orion yeah i can burn one from my ioun stone  laura should we wrap it at all  taliesin itll be fine in the bag of holding  liam not knowing what else to do vax is going to go to the door and just inspect it  see if its 
none	 trapped  matt roll a perception check  liam 24  matt 24 all right the door does appear to be locked it is not trapped  liam not trapped okay ill get to work on it then 32  matt okay 32 you relatively easy the door comes unlocked the small its like a very very  intricately carved brass handle that has swirls upon it like its almost like a burst of wind  being blown and frozen in gold you turn it and the door opens slightly  liam pull up im still wearing my tin hat 
none	 and i pull up my hood from my elven cloak and i go  stealth and i am stealthed because thats a 32 and i have a look around outside the door  matt okay as you open the doorway it leads into a secondary chamber this is an 80footdiameter  circular chamber now so youre entering the edge of a giant circle there are a series of other  doors almost in respective rows next to each other and you also see in the center of the  room a vibrant chandelier made of white crystal like the spheres 
none	 you saw in the previous room you  were in giving off a warm atmospheric glow to the entire room in the center of the room there  is a semicircle desk that is also made of a similar white stone material that the rest of the  room is made out of with polished gold leaf trimming on the edge and you do see what looks to  be an elven man sitting at the desk longish graywhite hair hes wearing robes that are  finely dressed and hes halffalling asleep at a desk with a series of books 
none	 kind of piled up on  the side as soon as the doorway opens he looks up and you hear a slight little arcane tinging  sound like a little bell being rung as you open the door he looks up for a second  laura say hello  liam yes yes yes i just walk forward and pull down the cloak and say hello  matt stay right where you are do not move  liam hands up in the air  matt do not move  liam nothing in them no threat no danger here a little lost

none	 the hallways its a  beautiful beautiful kind of domed center chamber into a long series of white stone hallways  similar material to what the first room you arrived in looked like eventually to a main foyer  area which has a very high ceiling and a series of beautifully carved pillars that show different  creatures almost like devas and demons battling each other as they spiral up these pillars to the  front doorways there are two guards that are adorned in kinda silver and gold armor with these  very high elven in designshaped helmets and 
none	 they step to the side as the doors  open on their own  laura love the hat  matt guards do not respond to you whatsoever they just step to the side gatekeeper says all  right well here is your way out have a wonderful evening and do please return for your  report on the morrow  laura of course  sam oh one more question before you leave what district are we in right now  matt the erudite quarter  sam thank you  travis gesundheit  matt good night the doors slam boof behind

none	 the killing of such an innocent life a creature of impulse grog  felt only pity for this well this terrified little thing and his disobedience cost him  dearly  beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader his uncle kevdak grog was abandoned and left to die  exiled from his herd it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save  saved him it was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike that healed grog bringing him back  from deaths edge and they have remained close friends ever since  
none	 most nights grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches ha or accompanying  scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors  also ale  marisha a first impression of keyleth would leave you with little information on the halfelven  druid you might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is  kind of sweet chuckle  of course it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions thunder under that  unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose natural powers have

none	 anyways it wasnt long before the headmaster of the tribe her father korren realized her true  prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster  just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization  teachings from ancient traditions and exceedingly high expectations every druid leader to be must  embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst  the fellow headmasters they call this the aramente or noble odyssey when her father felt  she was ready he 
none	 set her on the path to truly discovering herself not knowing when or if she  will ever return  as she hiked down the mountain towards stillben she meditated on the task ahead part of the  aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior a valiant protector and a wise and compassionate  leader with this knowledge one thought plays on repeat in her mind is she even worthy  taliesin percy was the third of seven children born to a noble family who lived far to the north  in the ancient castle of whitestone with so many

none	 yeah they seemed very grateful  sam we could stop them on their way out  taliesin i think this will also be a conversation that lady kima will have some  marisha okay well the thing we then need to immediately decide before we unstone lady kima  is whatre we going to do with the horn  taliesin i think if we have allura here and begin that conversation then we  can have alluras insight  marisha before we unstone lady kima  taliesin yes i think we tell allura before we unstone lady kima everything thats 
none	 happened  liam the only person the only person that would remotely know is you tiberius  and i dont think  sam hes a rat  liam oh thats a good boy  travis and hes asleep  liam he didnt seem to know anything i think allura is the person to go to right now  laura well you need to share it with us  ashley wake up from bed  travis hes sleeping  taliesin no lets wait until alluras here i think and we can  travis do we tell her do we tell her 
none	 we have the horn or do we not  liam yes yes we do  marisha why dont we just wake up tiberius  laura tiberius little darling  sam im still punishing him  liam im still cuddling him  orion did they wake me up  liam no im holding you  orion okay  liam i dont want to wake you up  matt you start to wake up and then he scritches the side of your cheek and  you go right back to sleep  laura damn it hes so cute i dont know what

none	 allura first then unfreeze lady kima  liam she sent us after kima kima thinks that shes in the middle of a fight the moment she  comes out shell be all hot and bothered  marisha okay hang on hang on thats true she did send us after kima so what if theyre both on  the side that we dont  travis yeah alluras going to unfreeze kima  taliesin were going to have to trust somebody  travis why dont we just hold onto the horn for a second and see what they do without it  
none	 laura why dont we tell them we didnt find it why dont we just hide the horn  travis we just hold onto it in the bag  marisha dont we have a safe didnt we build a safe in our keep  matt you did not have a safe built but you could possibly have that done  ashley wait so why are you guys so against giving the horn to kima  marisha i just feel like if its so terrible why does she want it for herself  laura she doesnt she wants to hide it  
none	 ashley does she want to destroy it  laura maybe she wants to destroy it maybe she wanted to get it up above ground so she could  destroy it  sam theres a second horn maybe she has the other one and wants the matching set  taliesin do we know that theres a second horn  laura shes a paladin shes good paladins are good by  sam im fine trusting her i was fine trusting clarota  travis do you want to wake up do you have something important to say  marisha right because no one 
none	 of the church has ever been bad before  liam we didnt trust clarota we were using him as much as he was using us  laura some of us truly trusted clarota  liam it went south well most of us  travis all right fuck it i walk over and i take the rat out of vaxs hands and i shake it awake  sam hes still a rat  travis i shake it a lot  marisha i undo his polymorph i undo his polymorph  sam and matt with what  marisha by polymorph  matt

tavern	 still drunk and awake we dont want to go to bed yet just just talk with us  laura i just want to hear your lovely little explanation darling about what the horn is and  why you dont trust kima  orion oh  taliesin tell us a story  marisha tell us a story  laura please you havent told any of us anything  marisha we havent talked to you in a week  orion the horn of orcus  matt horn of orcus  orion this thing comes from a devil a demon nothing good could 
none	 ever come from anything it made  in existence it needs to be destroyed and im sorry let me articulate these words a little bit  more there is nothing that you can use this particular artifact for any reason of good the  fact that it is even here is a very bad sign because it was taken from one of these beasts  ashley so why dont we destroy it  orion thats exactly what we need to do  travis isnt that what kima wanted  laura what if they want to destroy it  orion i 
none	 dont think they wanted to bring it back  laura question why  orion because there is the liquid hot magma that was below where it was being held was very  sufficient for it to be thrown in  marisha thats true see im with him  laura wait but your crushing fist couldnt destroy it so maybe lava cant destroy it so  maybe it needs something extra special that only they know about  travis it needs the sword of gryffindor  orion no pike could destroy it  ashley exsqueeze me i dont think thats true 
none	  orion give yourself a little bit more credit you killed a dragon  laura and travis you did kill a dragon  ashley i did kill a dragon huzzah  marisha and you died and come back to life by the way we havent talked about that what was it  like on the other side  travis lets stay on topic here  marisha oh im sorry im a little tipsy  liam vax shoves another flagon in front of keyleth  ashley i dont think i can destroy it  taliesin from what i understand is it 
none	 possible that its not possible to destroy this and instead  it has to be banished somewhere perhaps  orion no if it could be a permanent banishment yes but we dont know what kind of plane and what  creatures lie there that would perhaps come upon that artifact what are the elements  fire burns earth  laura wind blows  orion light destroys darkness pike youre the only one who  sam rock beats scissors  orion exactly scanlan youre the only one who could if your weapon had any kind of light  enchantment on them 
none	 could probably smash this thing to bits then we would have to scatter the  remnants the pieces far from each other if not find different ways to destroy those pieces  laura why dont you trust them  orion because it comes from something that would  laura not the horn why dont you trust kima  orion because they wanted to bring it somewhere where they i dont know which is why i wanted  you to do the half thing where we could question kima without her attacking us or trying to attempt  to take the 
none	 horn from us  marisha well heres my thing even if she has good intentions say she has good intentions and  maybe they just wanted to bring the horn back to study it and no one should be messing with this  whatsoever  laura i think they want to destroy it  taliesin im of the opinion they probably want to banish it somewhere  travis yeah i think they do  marisha then why dont we just agree to not hand it over  taliesin no this is good this means that theres no reason necessarily not 
none	 to trust them  we just know that we dont trust the horn and thats a perfectly reasonable way to come at it  liam in the short term scanlan are you able to send it to another dimension for a while  laura no i dont trust it anywhere out of our sight  sam i cannot it is not alive i cannot  travis put it in the bag  laura its in the bag  taliesin its perfectly safe in the bag  travis how about we rest we put the horn in the bag we wake 
none	 up kima we go oh we brought you  back sorry we dont have the horn if we did what would you do with it and then we decide  what we do  taliesin i like half that plan  marisha i kind of like that plan  orion i like that plan too  laura i think we should tell her we didnt get it and see what she does  orion allura is somebody who should not be here when this conversation happens because if they  turn south shes a more powerful sorcerer than i  
none	 marisha we need to decide do we tell her that we destroyed it or do we tell her that we just  didnt get it and that its still down there  travis we cant say destroyed because we dont know how we did that right  laura no we didnt destroy it we say oh no they we got overrun and we had to leave  taliesin but then theyre going to tell us to go back for it  travis thats fine but if we ask like what she wouldve done if we had it and when she 
none	 leaves we  go hah we have it  laura or we go oh well good then actually we do have it you can do that  travis yeah if she wants to study it or use it or transform it into something we dont give it  to her we try to destroy it ourselves if she wants to banish it and do something that tiberius  is happy with then we go like hey we have it  liam when we meet her i dont think we should have it i think one or two of us should 
none	 take it  away we dont all have to be at that meeting  taliesin i think we just keep it in the bag of holding shell never suspect  marisha well hang on its in the bag of holding right now  laura yeah  taliesin yes  orion grog is there nothing else in that bag of holding  travis nothing it can we took out all the stuff it can turn into some like evil transformer or  something  liam you know the other characters can make insight checks too you know that right  matt 
none	 theres a pile somewhere with armor  travis everything has out with parentheses next to it  liam if we have it then shes she could say youre lying  laura or she might not be able to tell because were so good at lying  laughter  liam i dont think your winks will work on her  sam legitimately no one can tell when im lying  marisha i mean we could stone shape it and i could like stone shape it and bury it somewhere in  our keep  travis one person should leave with it 
none	 ill leave with it  liam yes its fucking simple  taliesin thats genius  travis yeah ill leave its not like im going to talk to the sorcerers  liam you and i could take a walk with it and play tiddlywinks or something in the woods thats  fine whats wrong with that its easy  taliesin thats a very good plan  orion do you want it very far away  travis yeah youre a talker im not  taliesin no we dont  marisha wait youre talking about just taking a stroll through the forest with

none	 temporarily we can possibly relocate it but we have to sighs  liam you saw your mission as a suicide mission but if you had secured it what were your plans  what was plan b what were you going to do  matt well if i were to fall in the process of trying to get the horn others would come after  me i sent word to my order that if i did not return they would send more  laura can i insight  matt go for it yeah go ahead and roll insight  laura 19 
none	  sam ooh  marisha whisper time sweet sweet whispers  sam keep subscribing guys because whispering action doesnt come free  marisha how many subscribers away are we  lucas 38  marisha 38 subscribers  travis marisha and sam thats a lot  marisha that is still a lot  sam keep subscribing to geek and sundry where you can watch matt mercer whisper at people  matt and she goes so this horn which is one of two if allura is correct was sealed a thousand  or so years ago by those who originally cut it 
none	 from the head of the avatar of orcus of which it  was bestowed they once he was slain did everything they could within their power to  destroy it yet this artifact instilled with the purity of orcus was indestructible to their  knowledge so the least they could do was to seal both horns across the world from each other and  forget that it even existed which worked well until recently it wasnt until these visions came  to me and other members of my order that we knew that this this was a thing and me 
none	 being the  closest in my pilgrimage we took that as time of the essence i was to go in there with a team and  retrieve it if it couldnt be destroyed at the very least we could convene and decide a safer  place to possibly reseal it and forget there are magical ways of forcing those of us who know how  to forget that would be the safest thing for it if there is a way to destroy it we dont know  but that could also be sought after we have arcane and divine knowledge 
none	 we didnt have back  then so in the long run it needs to be retrieved the longer it stays down there in the  underdark no matter where you placed it it draws like a beacon all darkness to it until something  else like this beholder kvarn will take up the mantle and themselves be as dangerous or more so than  he ever was  laura so the other horn is still safe  matt as far as i know the visions only gave me access to where this one was i can only assume  that 
none	 its out there but if someone else were to find it i would know that they probably have  knowledge of the second one existing as well i dont know if kvarn shared this information but  if someone else takes the mantle of this horn whats to stop them from seeking the other  liam bummer  marisha okay  matt regardless i appreciate that were all alive and were together and where are we  laura oh youre in our home  sam greyskull keep its in emon  matt were in emon  sam yes  matt 
none	 well thats wondrous we can speak with allura she would have the wisdom to know what to  do with this next  sam hypothetical what if an army of darkness was slowly approaching emon to kill all of us  matt what are you saying  sam well we killed clarota and kvarn but we there was a lot of bad guys down there that we  could not kill  laura we hurt that elder brain real bad but not bad enough  matt i dont know much about the illithid themselves but they reside deep and they 
none	 are not  fans of the surface i believe that it was kvarns initial onset that was pushing them both  in union with the duergar and pushing them towards the siege they spoke of something about bringing  twilight to the surface world i dont know what that was about but i fear what knowledge they  have if left alone at the very least i know that theyre probably having to return and lick their  wounds where we left behind it would be folly for them especially knowing that were aware to  attack now  laura 
none	 okay thats good  matt but we can notify those in kraghammer to buffer their defenses close the tunnels that you  took down there and my army as well and that should give us time to prepare if we choose to  seize or at least seal them off  laura and your order is what  matt the order of the platinum dragon  laura right thats a really good order right  taliesin history check can i do a history check  matt its a religion check  taliesin thats a religion check not history check  
none	 marisha pike  matt you could roll a history check and probably gain some knowledge based on that but the  ashley could i do it  matt if youd like to  ashley are you doing a religion check percy  taliesin im doing a history check if you want to do a religion check  ashley ill do a religion check  matt go for it  taliesin 22  ashley so fucking close  matt i mean you guys are familiar loosely with the name bahamut youve heard tiberius bring it  up before youve seen temples 
none	 to it but your knowledge knows that bahamut is very well regarded  as the lawful good deity of justice and honor and is primarily one of the great good gods of this  pantheon  taliesin if were going to trust anyone i think this is a good  travis yeah i feel pretty good about this  taliesin i trust the organization they have a sterling reputation  marisha so kima pieinthesky goal you would destroy the horn  matt if we had the means of doing so yes wed have to talk to the order wed have 
none	 to talk to  the council wed have to bring people that we could trust and that had the capabilities of  knowing if this were possible how we would go about it its beyond my knowledge  liam i think what worries us is anyone coming in contact with it would be corrupted  matt dont go into contact with it  laura no  liam no of course  marisha just within range  sam yes is proximity okay  matt i dont know i saw it for as long as you did  laura this could be 
none	 bad  sam evil grog  laura kind of uncomfortable  matt the essence of most artifacts like this it goes more than just touch one has to be imbued  bond with these artifacts to attune with them like any powerful magical item to truly gain its  power but thats not to say that itself does not contain some sort of foul intelligence  ashley can i go downstairs and go get grog  matt okay so you walk your way down  travis sings ive got a lovely bunch of coconuts  matt as youre walking past 
none	 as you walk past you are immediately met in the hallway by erwen your  servant your halfling elder servant who walks up and says dear i wanted to let you know that a  scroll came for you some sort of a summons and he hands it to you  ashley me  sam probably jury duty  matt and he kinda walks past you in the tunnel  taliesin always the worst time  matt you open it up a little bit its not hasnt been opened you kinda pull the paper and  open it up its 
none	 a summon to the council of taldorei its written by the hand of the clerk  and it says essentially the sovereign uriel has been notified of your arrival and would like to  see you at the council chambers posthaste  ashley okay im still going to go get grog but ill pass the scroll around hey grog come  upstairs  travis oh yeah  marisha that was for all of us  laura yeah  matt it was addressed to vox machina  travis is it clear  ashley just dont say anything yet but just come 
none	 upstairs  travis did she ask about me  laura she definitely did  ashley she did yeah  travis with my bald head  matt all right you make your way back in kima finishes her meal and you guys are chatting a  bit shes just like all right if i may ask how did you seal it i feel uncomfortable knowing  the process and that its at least safe  marisha oh we have one of the best defense mechanisms grog  travis hello lady kima  laura its in a very secure magical item  
none	 matt she glances at you and goes all right very well just be mindful that you dont go  reaching in there  marisha i use my druidcraft as he enters to make little sparkles and lightning bugs appear around  him grog  matt lady kima who is currently covered in dirt and sweat still in the golden armor that she  wrestled from the longdead corpse of a dwarf in the underdark her chin is smattered with dried  mashed potatoes and a bit of her breakfast kinda gives  laura so shes covered in food as well 
none	  matt laughs gives you a look as youre walking in like its good to see you alive friend  travis yeah more than alive i think  ashley and also he actually pulled you out of the cavern with one arm while you were stone out  of the whole place  travis oh stop i dont like to brag  matt she stands up and kinda wipes the food off her chin clutches her symbol and then steps  right before you looking up towards your face and says i thank you friend grog  laura friendzoned  
none	 matt and then reaches out and gives you a big hug  liam plus he decided not to put you in the magical bag when you were a statue  matt she releases grog slightly and kinda gives you a keen look and goes also appreciated  travis yeah well you know  laura oh my god thank god  sam why dont you go rest well summon allura and well continue the conversation  from there i guess  matt please id love to see her its been too long all right im going to is there a room
