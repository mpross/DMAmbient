from where it was packaged  matt okay then last we left off the mighty nein were making their way northward across the  northern side of the marrow valley toward the city of shadycreek run to fulfill the second of  two jobs they had accepted from the gentleman while they were in zadash along the journey  while they were leaving hupperdook in the middle of the night three of their members had been  taken it was discovered in the morning when they were nowhere to /town/ be found that they had been  captured by a group of slavers traveling north back to the city of shadycreek run itself upon  investigating the details of this capture you encountered an individual coming up the road with  a similar aligning interest keg in discussing the means of traveling to find these individuals  responsible and discovering that keg had information on them you decided to travel  together making your way around the crispvale thicket encountering a number of indigenous  insectlike creatures known as ankhegs near the longabandoned farmlands that were once built in  /none/ the outskirts of the forest camping inside you encountered a few members of a firbolg village  that had long existed hidden from the world within this thicket that had been assaulted by  these same slavers known as the iron shepherds you encountered an elder protector of this tribe  along with a boy who had survived this encounter and were sent off on your way traveling northward  on horseback you managed to catch up and actually make ground on the iron shepherds comparing your  intel and through a few surprises as to what they were carrying /town/ a plan was hatched to set an  ambush to halt them in their tracks and assault them upon the plan taking off things were going  in your favor but through a series of bad lucks a bad lucks the plural its an actual english phrase  ashly thats how bad they were  matt they were bad a series of moments of bad luck and a toolate realization of the  overwhelming power of the foe you faced one of you fell mollymauk lies slain in the middle of  the road at the hands of lorenzo the /none/ leader of the iron shepherds making an example pushing keg  onto the ground leaving her with the knowledge of what he perceives as her fault to live with it  and to spread their name and the terror of what they do and not to let anybody else get in their  way you all watched quietly unable to really have a moment yet to digest what has happened as  you see the carts slowly quietly make their way northward out of sight beyond the hills towards  your eventual destination and thats where we begin theres a /none/ faint bit of snowfall thats  still coming down from the clouds above you there in the valley the flurry the storm that has been  encroaching is not that far off you look down past the somewhatmuddy tracks of the wheels of  the carts that had headed away from you your horses still stashed alongside the outer hills in  which you had set this ambush you look down to the bloodied still body of mollymauk as the snow  slowly begins to fall and rest upon his form  liam okay im going to give us about /none/ ten minutes to figure out what we want to do here and then i  am sending frumpkin out after them we need to decide something now because i am going to be out  of it for a bit  marisha yeah we do need to decide something beau walks over to keg and grabs keg by the coif  and tries to slam keg into the ground  matt do you resist  marisha did you think that maybe telling us that lorenzo was a high fucking magic user would have  been or are you still fucking /none/ working with them  ashly i didnt know im sorry im sorry i didnt know  liam beauregard she would have told us she wouldnt have been able to hide it  marisha where is his fucking stupid tapestry where is it  ashly they are going to shadycreek they are probably going to take them to the sour nest  thats where they  marisha i go and i look is his tapestry still on her horse  matt yeah the tapestry of bahamut is still rolled up and strapped over the back of one of the horses  /none/ marisha i storm over to it and i rip it off the horse and i say this is ours now he was our  fucking friend he wasnt your fucking friend were taking this back  liam i pull keg up this place they are going is it permanent or a temporary camp or its been  there for years and this where they always are  ashly its where they always are  liam do you know how far off we are from it now  ashly how far is shadycreek  matt about two days travel and its /none/ maybe a two hour journey into the forest north of shadycreek  marisha i go over to mollys body  ashly this is pointless  sam what what is pointless  ashly theyre even more powerful than i remember i didnt even fucking know that lorenzo could do  that you saw what he did theres no way its fucked  marisha i think shes fucking right how long have you been separated from these fucking assholes  ashly long sigh maybe a month i dont know  sam they learned to do that in a month  ashly yeah /none/  marisha its not a lot of time to  ashly they didnt show me much im clearly not very fucking bright so theres a lot i probably  didnt pick up on but i dont know im realizing i dont fucking know anything about them  liam how many people are in their camp what did you call it  ashly the sour nest is where the iron shepherds have camp  liam yeah  ashly but i mean shadycreek run is its a full city  liam sure what about the sour nest  ashly i thought there /none/ were just five i dont know who those other two were i dont fucking  know everything that i thought i knew about them i dont know  marisha i search mollys body and look for the tarot cards first  matt easy enough to find you have to go through a few pockets on the inside of the jacket but you  eventually find where he keeps them  marisha i take those and i keep those to myself take the amulet  matt okay so you have the periapt of wound closure  marisha toss it to caleb /none/  sam youre just going to pick his body off  marisha im going to take what his dead body isnt using any more  sam but he woke up before maybe we should leave it with him in case he needs it later  marisha im going to leave him with everything else i dont think we should take his sword  liam what do we want to do  sam caleb shes right we cant fight them  ashly cut your losses  marisha not without help anyway did you guys just suddenly fucking forget that they took /none/ yasha  they took fjord they took jester  liam that is what im talking about mollymauk is dead three are not not yet and we have invested  a lot of time into forging this alliance we are in nott im not proposing a headtohead  confrontation maybe i want to know where they are i want to know what conditions theyre in  im not willing to walk away from this  sam it would be the smarter bet  ashly hes not wrong  marisha fuck you both  liam we could live sure we could live /town/ we go hide in the woods go back to picking pockets and  pulling scams on people you know that i want more than that  marisha do yall remember what molly said a few weeks ago when he told us that he left every town  better than what he found it when he first told me that i remember that my first initial knee  jerk reaction was you fucking arrogant narcissistic bastard no one can fucking know  that he was an arrogant bastard but he was right and do you know how i know we had /town/ a  conversation last night when we were up for watch and he asked me what my greatest lie was and we  pulled fucking cards for it loser would go first he told me this story about tricking a town into  thinking he was royalty being a king to pull off a scam i was almost going to tell him about my  childhood and i didnt because he told that fucking story and i realized even in his scams  when he was doing something shitty he was still making people feel good or feel special the /town/ town  was being visited by graced by his presence by his royal highness and i told him this story of  ruining a couples lives by extorting them because i fucking could because i fucking felt like it i  realized if i can deliberately leave a town shittier than what i found it of course he could  fucking leave a town better than what he found it and im not going to do that again im not saying  that im going to go off and be a fucking hero but maybe we can equal out and /town/ i can at least not  fuck any more shit up take baby steps towards the leaving the town better thing thats the least  i can do for him and im going to start with these fuckheads  ashly ill take you there  marisha all right  liam what are we going to do first the man crawled out of a grave once if hes to be believed  marisha who the fuck is lucien  liam hes done it once maybe he will do it again do we stay here do we try to find i  /none/ dont ive read of miracles  ashly look you guys dont have a lot of time for your friends the ones that are captured  sam we should bury him and leave some sort of marker  liam a note  marisha im assuming shadycreek doesnt have high level priests and the empire and churches and  stuff like that doesnt sound like the type of place that has  ashly one of the last places youd find something like that  marisha yeah  matt the only things that you would know of shadycreek from your experience would be /none/  whatever miracle workers that would exist there are owned by the tribes and weird tales of  strange hermits that live in the forest beyond the city  ashly okay but i havent met anyone directly  matt not directly no  liam how many days travel are we from the beginning of this journey  matt from the beginning  liam yeah from the gentleman  matt close to 17 or so days since you left zadash  liam we are in the middle of nowhere  sam keg no judgement or anything but you sort of froze /none/ up in the little fight we had  ashly yeah  sam when you say you can take us there are you just talking about taking us there and dropping us off  ashly ill take you there ill help you through ill do what i can  sam how do we know you wont freeze up again  marisha or cut and run like you said  ashly the way you talk about molly i had a friend like that once just one they killed him  and i ran then too i left him behind hes the reason /none/ im here i didnt think i would do it  again but i did i fucking froze up i cant promise it but i promise that ill try my life  isnt shit its never been its kind of the shit about meeting people that are actually kind is  that you realize what a fucking nightmare your lifes been before  marisha its funny how the good people can make assholes like us feel so small  ashly yeah  liam you can get us there though  ashly i can get you there  liam it does not /town/ need to be a frontal assault we dont need to throw our lives away  sam we cant fight them we cant fight them  ashly heres the thing about shadycreek run it is a lawless town if you guys have got coin then  people will fight for you there isnt a lot of honor there but there are people that are willing  to fight if theyre incentivized there might be people we can gather at least get intel there  might be ways of breaking them out i dont know there are people there that hate the /town/ iron  shepherds and there are a lot of fucking people there that are scared of them it is a long shot  i dont think its unreasonable to say its a suicide mission but if you want to do it if you  want to go after them they dont run the town there are people that could be swayed but youre  going to need money  marisha i go back over to mollys body and start finding his coin purse hes going to sponsor his  own campaign to resurrection  matt okay on molly you find /none/ 173 gold pieces and 13 silver pieces amongst a cluster of other knick  knacks and trinkets if you are so interested  marisha nott want a trinket to remember molly by  sam molly said not to steal from happy people  marisha is that what you think im doing  sam nope i think you should take everything you can but i cant steal from this one  marisha i take the money  ashly i dont mean to rush you guys but shit gets way worse once they get back to the sour nest  liam i /none/ pull out the clay cats paw and cast earthen grasp and the cats claw forms out of the  dirt and i use it to start digging a hole in the earth  matt near one of the hills  liam yeah as the cats claw starts digging down im looking for the glaive wasnt left right  he took it with him  matt no he took it with him  liam sticks branches ja  matt there are branches to the tree that you had cut down some of the logs that are there there  are some /none/ pieces of branch that could be utilized  ashly you trying to make firewood  liam no i go to mollys body and begin to get the coat off him  matt okay  liam the claw has about a minute so hopefully it can dig something deep enough  matt id say given the size of the claw and its earthen attachment it can make in that minute  that it has a fairly functional hole  liam okay im going to start to pull him into the hole  marisha lets wrap him in his cloth  sam /none/ thats a good idea we certainly cant carry it anymore its very impractical  marisha it was impractical the moment he bought it  sam absolutely its a terrible purchase  ashly i step back and look away to give them privacy  matt okay as you guys carefully and respectfully take the tapestry of the platinum dragon bahamut  and use it to wrap him comfortably the spell ends and the hole is complete  sam are we leaving his swords theres one that can teleport  marisha its a pretty awesome sword from what i remember  sam /none/ sure is  liam i grab some paper out of my bag and i start writing a note to mollymauk telling him to find  us through the gentleman  marisha thats a good idea  sam tell him his name too or ooh we can make one up  marisha laughs mollymauks pretty unique and different its a good name  sam all right  marisha i take the swords  matt okay  marisha or at least is there one fancy one and one basic one  matt i mean theyre both pretty fancy but one of them /none/ is a brass gold color its the one that  you had found not too long ago  sam thats the one  matt the summers dance  marisha yeah well take that one summers dance well give it back to him if he comes back  to us  sam its a loan its a loan  marisha well and also there might be grave robbers  sam yeah fuck those guys right  marisha looters yeah  liam i take that note and i stick it into the lapel of the folds of his clothes and i brush /none/ the  hair out of his face and then i start to push soil back over the body  marisha i help him  sam should we say some words or anything  marisha pour a drink  sam sure ill pour drinks  marisha long may he reign  sam long may he reign  marisha thats the best fucking shit i got  liam shine bright circus man  sam i think youre supposed to say things about how good they were and how many people loved them  and what a wonderful life they had but i /none/ dont think any of those things are true or at least we  dont i dont think he even knew  liam caleb sighs and takes a fivefoot sixfoot sturdy branch one that could be a walking stick  and i take that stone that lucky rock that i found and i start to hammer the branch into the  ground so it is sticking up like a post and then hang mollymauks coat from it  sam thatll be stolen though  liam not right away if he comes up out of the ground it will be here waiting /none/ for him in a day  or two  marisha maybe you should write another note and leave it on the coat that says dont fucking  steal this you fucking looter assholes dead guys buried here  liam i think we will just leave the coat beauregard  marisha i feel like a note could be very convincing but thats fair all right lets go  sam go after them  liam well we do not have to decide what we are going to do right away we could have an  opportunity grab our friends we dont need /none/ to rush into the lions den lets see what we are  looking at what we are dealing with we get our three friends back we have not traveled with them  this far to throw it away  sam to throw what away i want to hear you say it why do you want to go after them  liam their deaths would be a waste  sam wrong why  liam caleb storms off into the woods  marisha keg  ashly beau  marisha thank you  ashly for what  marisha i think we all would

figures /town/ that are left in the  road people left in the road  ashly dead  matt not moving  ashly guys theres something in the road  marisha oh fuck  ashly i cant tell if they are dead from here  liam i send frumpkin up into the air as an owl  matt swoops down and does a few loops over it and within a moment of scanning can see it is three  bodies a human man appears to be in his forties a younger halfelven man in his twenties and a  young human woman /dung/ probably in her twenties early thirties or so they are all slain but there is  no sign of traumatic wounds or any damage to their body though they are damp  ashly damp  matt damp  marisha is it snowing is there snow on the ground  matt there is snow on the ground you can see theres bits that are gathered on them  ashly why would they just be left in the road  sam caleb has told us all of this  liam yes  sam i am going to scout up ahead and see /none/ if i recognize them  matt okay make a medicine check for one thing as you glance at the bodies  sam 12 plus zero  matt not too bad you recognize the man as the one you saw in the cage before you and at a quick  glance you can see elements of flash frostbite on parts of their skin you gather they are probably  the ones that were in the cage in front of you  marisha does it look like they tried to escape the cage  sam they were dead when the frost blast /town/ hit everybody  marisha then they dumped the bodies  ashly well given that he left them in the middle of the road think this is his second warning  third fourth  sam or maybe he just wanted to move fast without extra weight  marisha i think he just cares that little for human life  sam well well cut out their tongues for food and then bury them  ashly nott with the fucking tongues again my man  sam what its protein  ashly look i know youre weird but if you could tone it down /town/ just a skosh  sam you dont have to watch  ashly ill hear it youre so loud  sam fine  liam im pulling the first of the three off the road to the side  ashly i help  marisha ill help  matt you manage to pull the bodies off the road into the grasses on the side  ashly nott  sam dont worry theres other tongues in the sea  laughter  matt you do know keg looking at the road youre about at the point where you diverge from  the path to follow /town/ up the road but continue on to nogvurot but to head to the quannah breach and  eventually shadycreek run is due north from where you stand  ashly do i know of any ways to not go through the front gates is there any sort of circumventing i  could do  matt unfortunately not without adding another week or so travel through the mountains  ashly ugh okay never mind then  matt its possible but its a treacherous journey to move through the dunrock mountains to  get there  sam when we arrive they may have /none/ left word to look out for us they know what we look like we  should have some sort of disguise i know that you and i can disguise ourselves you can  sumalee i can too  ashly beau and i are sol  marisha yeah i have my cool reversible cloak  sumalee i can make you disappear for a while  ashly that would probably be good how long  sumalee one hour  ashly how long does it take to get to shadycreek  matt from where you are now its a little under two days /none/ travel  sam when we get to the gates we could maybe just  ashly slip in  matt you do know that just beyond the breach there is a gate that is guarded by one of the  families of the tribes there is a toll thats taken as you pass through  ashly okay that would probably be a good idea  sumalee i can do that  ashly thanks  sam for you well find a fake mustache or something  liam are you able to do just one person  sumalee no i think im able /none/ to do  liam could you do the whole group  sumalee yes i can right  sam right god  laughter  marisha is it pass without a trace youre looking at  matt that can help them hide if they want  marisha yes so as long as we stay within 30 feet of you we get plus ten to our stealth bonus  which would be very helpful  sam we dont turn invisible  marisha correct  matt if anybody wants to hide it does help out  sam you guys could hide under the horses /town/ or something  ashly okay  marisha thats badass i like that  matt keg leading on to the north you diverge from the glory run road heading into the high  grasses of the north marrow valley you continue on for the better part of the day taking breaks  as necessary and for you to recover your forms you continue pushing on not at a breakneck pace  for fear of catching up to your quarry but enough where you know at least you are keeping pace  eventually the light of the sky begins to grow dim /dung/ as the evening calls to you at which point the  flurry has come the snow begins to get heavier the darkness is darker than normal at dusk and the  air gets bitter cold what do you wish to do to set camp  sam do we still have the tents did we keep the tents we have the tents  liam weve taken everything yeah  ashly can i see through the dark with my night vision  matt you can see up to a 60foot distance i believe and its a dim light  ashly are there /town/ any structures around  matt make a perception check  ashly 19  matt pretty decent the hills here you dont see any structures per se but if you take a  moment to walk around you do see one hill that has a bank that is eroded and there is a bit of  an outcropping that may be about three or four feet outward if you were to all crowd in it  might be able to prevent piercing wind andor continuous snowfall but it would be pretty cozy  ashly do you guys feel like cuddling  /none/ marisha share body heat keeps us warmer  liam ugh  ashly ill keep watch im kind of wide so youll have more room  sam okay lets cuddle  matt you guys gather up here on the underside of this outcropping of the hill whos taking first  watch you keg make a perception check for your watch please  marisha beau tries to get a spot next to nila because shes large and fuzzy  ashly 15  matt looking out towards the distance as everyone else is silently sleeping in a cuddled  spoonlike position at times /none/ you glance out and see a few shapes moving past you see a few stars  blink out as shadows move past you quietly lean forward and begin to inspect and your eyes focus  at the outset of your darkvision you notice a small set of goats that are roving the plain  making their way the snow is falling and theyre trying to find themselves to warmer climate  liam weregoats  matt you dont know that  ashly dangerous violent weregoats  matt you dont find any other threat or anything during your watch next watch  /none/ marisha ill take it  matt beau make a perception check  marisha six total  matt everything seems pretty kosher  marisha im a little zoned out  matt during your watch is when the heavy part of the storm begins to hit no thunder its just  very cold and you can see your breath and youre having to involuntarily shiver as the cold kicks  in you can see now the snow piling up and youre thankful at this moment that you found this  outcropping in kegs vision because the distant hills that are open are /none/ now heavily piling with  this soft powdered snow its starting to fall and the wind is pushing through and some of its  hitting the left side of your face its starting to go a little numb and you have to brush it off  every now and then and try to do your best to dry up the biting cold water that is melting against  your cheek nevertheless your watch comes to an end without an issue who wants to take the final watch  sam i will  liam you and me goblina  sam sure /none/  matt make a perception check for me please  sam oh boy four  matt well youre lucky because nothing of note happens during your watch you are nervously  keeping your eyes out just in case waiting for another reverse ambush but nothing seems to catch  your attention as the morning comes to because you guys managed to cuddle i would like you all  to make a constitution saving throw with advantage please  sam marisha and ashly cuddlevantage  ashly oh both terrible  sam both for me too  sam i rolled a two /none/ and a two so four  marisha is this a saving throw or just a check  matt constitution saving throw  sam i do have my winter clothes i bought them just laying that out  matt ill say the winter clothes and the closeness of the group sure ill say youve  avoided in your hearty goblin form youre used to rough weather anyway  liam sam youre bonier than gollum  matt keg in full metal armor not so much  ashly i add my modifier though yes  matt you do add your modifier  ashly /none/ then its actually 15  matt yeah youre fine you shrug it off without issue  liam 21  matt caleb your warm coat keeps you warm  liam hearty german living  matt exactly youre used to these zemnian nights  marisha 12  matt thats enough to withstand it not a problem  sumalee 21  matt while the forest definitely keeps insulation to the storm your body is well suited for extreme  weather as well actually tricksy winter clothes but you got it  sam no you can  matt no you got them for a /none/ reason thats what theyre there for because of the body heat and  everything ill allow it  liam youre like the little kid in a christmas story i cant put my arms down  marisha so cute  matt as you guys continue your trek northward for the next day you slowly push forward and watch as  the rolling hills of this northern valley begin to even out the high grasses growing dense and  dusted with snow in the wake of this snowstorm that has passed through the night its now this  beautiful ice topped wonderland /none/ before you as the storm is past breaks in the clouds begin to  slowly emerge and show you glimmers of blue in the sky with sunlight comes a welcome comparative warmth  and this dusted field of diamonds begins to slowly thaw over the middays journey the looming peaks  of the dunrock mountain range approach closer engulfing your horizon almost like a toothy jaw of  some ancient titan that surrounds your peripheral you can make out as you get closer the craggy  break in the mountains ahead familiar to you its like a spiral fracture of /none/ a bone where  suddenly what was once a solid mountain range seems to have torn and sundered into two separate  ravines that seem to share a similar shape this you recognize as the quannah breach you guys  begin to approach by mid to late afternoon the front of the breach where you can see six  crownsguard in a small outpost built at the base of the quannah breach these as you know are  usually folks that essentially warn people from traveling into the breach and if they do let  them know that any return /none/ is going to be probably highly searched and highly inquired they enforce  it unless you slip them some coin then its not an issue on the way back theyre more there to  make money  ashly for appearances yeah  matt as you approach familiar to you a crownsguard begins to put a hand up to the  approaching horses and say hail  ashly oh goddamn it  matt where are you traveling to  ashly shadycreek  matt you have business in these cursed lands  ashly yeah were trying to get fucked can we move /none/ along  matt well your life is your own as is your business but you must understand that coming back  is no easy task a thorough search and inquiry into your person will be required  ashly yeah blah blah blah can i give you a couple of coins and you let us on our way please  matt very well how much do you give him  ashly how little will he take  matt customary to your experience and the times that youve traveled with the iron shepherds its  usually about two gold to just pass /none/  ashly okay yeah  matt he takes it and quietly lets you pass per person  sam molly would want us to do this trip maybe molly should pay  marisha yeah molly pays the toll  sam thank you molly  marisha two four six eight ten love you taliesin  matt well eight because she pays herself  sam yeah molly wouldnt want to pay for keg  sumalee thank you  ashly as he shouldnt  sumalee i have gold pieces i can use later too if you want them  ashly youre not going to /none/ want to spend any of that in shadycreek run theres nothing there for you  sam why they dont take money oh  ashly its just not a nice place  sam when youre home with your people are you one of the nicer ones or are you a bad girl at  home whats your how does it  sumalee i dont know i am one of the ones that not too many people rely on me  sam they dont rely on you  sumalee no  sam why  sumalee i think i am there was always /none/ some firbolg that was more powerful stronger smarter  more capable eventually i grew to accept being myself and i prefer to support rather than be a  leader this is my first time trying to be more than who i am  ashly keg does one of these to her in support  sumalee i do not know what that is but i like it and i heard you use the word fuck again  marisha you know maybe people dont rely on you because you havent been given the chance yet  were certainly going to rely on /none/ you  sumalee that makes me happy  marisha itll be a good test run at least for you then you can go back to your tribe and be  like yo people relied on me  ashly it was dope  marisha it was great you should rely on me more  ashly it was super tight  marisha and ashly yeah  marisha i dont know they probably wont sound like that  liam i kick my horse along  matt as you travel through these winding ravines choosing the one to the right which you know to /none/  be the wider of the two the low howl of the wind thats traversing these sheared twisted walls  like a haunting whistling and moan sound it accompanies the brush growing more dense the air  grows colder still as white banks of snow and ice frame various ledges and outcroppings along these  strangely curved and smoothly sheared cliffsides it feels like a giant had grabbed a mountain range  and tore it in two and theres an even break on each side it winds and curves its like a  natural labyrinth a few miles through this /dung/ strange maze youre met with a makeshift wall and  a tenfoot wooden gate your eyes at first notice a few dozen wooden poles carved into spikes  that emerge from the ground pointed in your direction from the base many of which are stained  dark while others still bear the weathered skulls of warning three armored folk stand there two  human men and a halforc woman all bearing weapons and watching you carefully as you approach  ashly this isnt the gate right  matt this is the gate  ashly oh it is  matt youve /none/ reached the edge of the quannah breach and turned to the final bastion outside of  the empire  ashly but its not the gate into shadycreek run  matt its the gate into the region of shadycreek run  sam this is the gate we need to hide in  matt this is  ashly but they see us  matt well theyve noticed you begin to turn and approach  sam quick hide hide quick  matt you would know this is coming because youve traveled this before  ashly okay so we wouldnt have turned the corner /none/  matt im describing it as you or youre describing it as youre about to turn the corner  ashly okay  liam rewind the tape just a little bit  ashly rewinds so  sam so thats just literally around this corner  ashly just right around if we went even just a few feet that way whoo whee guards big old  gate it would have been oh man  liam we were going at a pretty good pace there  ashly you guys are lucky that i stopped just a few feet right before we would have /none/ all seen the  gate youre welcome you know im really earning my keep here so  sam so hide or something right  ashly the plan was you guys can make yourselves look different  sam yes  ashly then youre going to make us invisible and then youre going to be a horse  sumalee i can do that  ashly ill get used to that eventually okay cool  marisha you guys are going to have three horses and then two riders  ashly do we have stuff to put on the third horse to make it /none/ look like a pack  liam yeah we could just take everything off our horses and gather it  marisha okay  liam yeah  ashly yeah  marisha well hide under the horse like indiana jonesstyle basically holding on underneath  okay thats going to take some grip strength but im into it  sam wait maybe if one of our horses is a pack horse you could be on top of the horse wrapped in  a blanket or something youre part of the gear that the horse is carrying  marisha do they search you on the /none/ way in  sam oh  ashly do they search us on the way in  matt depends on if you pay them on the way through  ashly well have to pay them  sam we can pay  ashly yeah i think this ones a little bit more expensive though isnt it probably the deeper  we get in or is it the same  matt you know that the previous gate generally you dont have to pay them the one you entered  it just helps you with no questions asked issue this is the gate run /none/ by the uteloch family of the  tribes and they enforce it both as a means of making money and to know whos coming and going  ashly mmhmm okay  matt so its an equal price to what you were paying previously  ashly we should definitely pay it though  sam which plan do we want you hiding under the horses or you hiding on the horse as suitcases  ashly i can hide under the horse  marisha ill hide as suitcase ill be a bundle  liam we lie you over the horse and we put /none/ a bunch of shit on top of you yeah  sam okay  liam then you are going to do some sort of horse magic that makes us sorry im unclear  invisible or  marisha more stealthy  sumalee you are invisible to people to others  sam i believe that  sumalee you dont have to change shape  ashly it might be helpful so theres not  sam you can make us totally invisible  sumalee i think so  marisha you give us a bonus to our stealth  sam ask your god  liam you /none/ cannot  sumalee aw  liam but what you can do its still useful here  marisha is it makes us more hideable  liam if the people who are hiding try to look like covered in cloth and shit and try to look  like cloth  sumalee itll pass  liam you can make it more believable  marisha you know the blanket in lord of the rings  sumalee yes  marisha the cloak  sumalee on the raft  marisha its like that  sumalee got it i will turn the blankets into  marisha rocky /none/ things sounds good  liam this whole pow wow was happening around the bend  ashly guards are like  sumalee wait what happens after we get through though  sam then we can do whatever we want  liam no we keep going for a while  ashly it will be a little bit of a ride  liam keep up appearances yeah youre going carry these two theyre both going to lie on top  of your horseback  ashly i cant be on a horse just me im too heavy  liam too heavy  ashly ill /none/ break her right because i cant  matt a single horse you can do  ashly a single horse i could be on it couldnt be me and beau or me and one of you  liam shes like all sticks though  matt with beau its possible not at a full run but at a travel journey you could probably do it  marisha or i could be a pack on one of your guys horse  liam she could be on our horse  sam yes yes  liam because you and i are skin and bones  /none/ ashly ill be on top of you if thats okay  sumalee thats fine  ashly okay  sumalee and i will make you pass without a trace  matt in this shady ravine just as it comes to an end before entering this next valley the shadows  seem to coalesce and cling to you and where previously the light itself is shaded and dim  its almost like youre stepping through moonlight  marisha almost like  matt well meaning like looking at those of you in the radius its like its nighttime where  youre standing the /none/ shadows are heavier the blacks are crushed  ashly weve both got stuff on top of us to make us look like  marisha mmhmm im wrapped in a bedroll  liam ja i mutter a few words and suddenly look like an old coot with a band of hair around the  sides and my jaw is off to the side a bit and its missing a few teeth and very squinty thats me  matt like robert duvall good  liam yeah thats it  sam i will mutter a few words and turn into  ashly what /none/ was this drawing back here  sam oh which one  ashly penis man  liam stop the game whats the drawing hold it up  ashly sorry out of character excuse me  liam lets see  sam its a dick man with a drink  laughter  sam it was a me and laura collab  liam somebody was talking having a moment then you draw a dick man  sam ill make myself look like rissa  matt okay perfect  sam because i know that one  liam rissa and robert duvall  matt those of /none/ you who are trying to be inconspicuous which would be beau and keg go  ahead and make general stealth checks  marisha plus ten right  ashly come on baby thats not great nine  marisha add ten to your roll your plus stealth  ashly oh 19  matt that is what the spell does  ashly i see  marisha its not good for me either 21 with the buff  sam thank god for the buff  ashly woo  matt okay as you guys turn the corner you now see the gate and the spikes /none/ and the warning skulls  and everything  sam its not as good as you described it  ashly i dont know a lot of adjectives im not a great storyteller i said its a gate and there  are people there what else do you need to know you need the fucking colors and the designs  sam you had smells and you had shapes and everything but this is  liam shut the fuck up  matt as you approach the halforc steps forward and goes hey you where you headed today  sam shadycreek run  matt /none/ well you pass through the breach you pay the toll  sam all right  liam yes we have that  matt good pay up  sam how much  matt two gold each  liam oh yeah okay  sam you know what ill get it dont even look i got this one here you go four from me  marisha yeah thats good  matt all right let them in she steps back in line with the two other they pull the two gates  and pull open as the wood clacks against the sides of the gates /none/ you all make your way through as the  guards watch as you pass in for a nervous moment you see the eyes pass over the two other riders  but make no issue as you continue inward you hear the gates clunking behind you now looking  ahead you can see the curvature of the ravine opens up into a widening valley you see a  limitless forest of climbing pines sprucelike trees only the common green you expect stands  instead an unexpected purplegray in color this wide blanket before you of this deep valley of  fading /town/ purple and gray color at the tops of theses trees along the tree line you can see a  sprawling and matted line of snowcapped buildings hovels and mudcovered streets that  vanish into this dense forest the city does not keep the normal cohesive shape of most instead  being a long line built along the tree edge and some sort of river or creek that it has been  constructed against it is a weird crooked long town that vanishes into the branches and leaves  youre no longer within the dwendalian empire welcome to the greying wildlands /town/  sam the greying wildlands  matt and to the lawless town of shadycreek run anything you wish to do before you head to the  city proper  ashly were still obscured beau and i  matt obscured in the sense that youre inconspicuous in dress  ashly right but thats still happening that spell is for an hour okay  liam do you have any place where we can lay up  ashly there are two places i would recommend there is this place called the plaza emporium a  pleasant but can be murderous dragonborn runs that /none/ shes not affiliated with any of the  unseemly folks directly so shes a bit more neutral we might be able to get information from her  liam does she murder everybody or does  ashly only people who piss her off so be on your best behavior the landlocked lady is a brothel  we might want to cover nilas eyes its run by the marduns who happen to be  sam thats who were looking for  ashly and they are the rival family of the folks that employ the iron shepherds  sam that seems like where /town/ we should go because the iron sheps wont be there to poke around and  find us  liam that is correct  marisha what is the name of that place again  ashly liam and sam the landlocked lady  ashly the proprietor is kind of a skeeze ball as you would imagine not necessarily the most  trustworthy guy but it is run by the marduns so of the safe places in the town thats probably up there  liam are you still laying across the back of a horse or have you pulled yourself up  ashly /town/ i have a little opening that i made for myself  laughter  ashly its just my face with a cigarette still  matt this little  sam our horse is smoking  marisha amazing  sam i vote landlocked lady  liam of course  marisha muffled i agree  sam and matt all right  sam lead us there with smoke signals  ashly that way  matt a short ride you eventually hit the outside of this township walking into the main street  you can see theyre slick with mud and dirty snow ragged peasants clutter /town/ the alleyways looking  your way with hands extended for some sort of alms theyre hoping to find  liam spits  sam ugh gross  matt an emaciated dog growls at you from a nearby doorstep and then darts off down the road behind  where you passed a wagon appears stuck in the mud as you pass it roughlooking folk tugging at it  and stopping to stare you down as you slowly move past they continue their work you nearly step  over someone with your horse who appears to be passed out face down in a /town/ patch of dirty snow a  bit of crimson rests at their side theyre not moving as you circle around them you watch as two  roughlooking fellows in hide clad armor come and inspect him as you glance over your shoulder you  watch as they rummage through his pockets lift up his not moving body and dump him in one of the  nearby alleys and keep on walking you see no crownsguard  sam oh man  matt this is the first town any of you have been in that has no watch no law keepers the /town/ road  doesnt go far north from where you enter as most of the town is this long stretched bar so within  15 minutes youve hit the plaza the central plaza to the town that you know as the clover plaza you  see log benches dotting the open area while a four story tower of motley colored stones stands  vigil over the area two balconies and a top housing crossbow and longbow wielding roughnecks  you know these to be taskers youre heading towards the landlocked lady easy to see on the  eastern side of this /town/ plaza there is a very beautiful two story complex that comparably  seems ostentatious against the buildings immediately to the right and left of it which look  to be in serious disrepair and rather rundown and colorless just bland woods gray and brown here  you can see the second story above the main archway a curved top arch there is a false bow of a  ship that is emerging outward this beautifully carved mermaid in the front that is clutching the  piercing front of the ship there it rests with a sign dangling from it saying /none/ the landlocked lady  marisha i totally get the name of the place now  sam its a consistent brand  marisha its very clever  liam in zadash it would look like shit but here its the belle of the ball  matt comparably yes  marisha it seems that they dont have a strong housing code they can get away with these more  unique builds its very fascinating  sam sure its really interesting architecture  matt its like shanghai china everything looks different  ashly how far away are the taskers did we just pass by /none/ them  matt youre skirting around the outside of the main tasker tower theyre scattered around and  as you guys are walking around you see most of the people that live in the city are in absolute  squalor and are here out of necessity are here because they came seeking some sort of fortune and  failed or theyve come to indulge in vices that have slowly crushed them the other half of the  populace are usually armored to some extent whether it be patchwork hides chain leathers  almost everyone here is armed even on a /none/ scale of poverty there seems to be a general sense of  needing protection amongst the chaos some folks look like theyre trying not to be seen many  parade their thickened arms you see one female privateer looking individual that comes through  the streets and spits on somebody whos huddled by one of the stumps growls at them before  continuing to walk on its a very unique and curious motley group of people that call this  place home  ashly if i talk to them will i be heard  matt if you talk to  /none/ sam us  ashly if i talk to the crew  matt no ones close enough to you you think if youre quiet enough  ashly i point out the tasker tower behind us and i say those are the taskers those are probably  the only other people in this shithole that might be of use  sam of use theyre good guys  ashly as much as anyones a good guy here they try not to get they try to prevent the innocent  from getting killed or fucked over obviously theyre not particularly successful but theyre  /none/ not under the thumb of any particular group  liam are they altruists though or are they mercenaries  ashly its altruistic strangely i kind of forgot about them because we always thought they  were nerds but now im trying to be a little bit better they might be helpful  sam do they have a uniform or how do you know them how do you know who they are how can you  identify them  matt what you can tell about the taskers is they wear chain shirts with one leather shoulder  pauldron that is painted /none/ blue i say painted blue because most of their uniform is whatever they can  put together to create some sort of consistency there is no built uniform what youre used to  seeing with crownsguard and any other royal military where things are built with fine  craftsmanship everything here is put together and slapdash that one uniform mark is usually the  chain shirt and the one blue shoulder armor some people paint it completely some put a line on it  and leave it there like a fuck you im not going to finish it  sam /none/ theyre like hells angels  matt kind of for the most part theyre keeping an eye out in the sense that they dont want  complete anarchy  ashly they still want money for their services but theyre slightly less assholeish than the most  matt theyre not going to stop someone from spitting on a peasant but if all of a sudden a  giant riot breaks out they will break it up and beat everybody up till it stops  sam okay  marisha its kind of cool  ashly closest thing to law that exists here  /none/ sam okay thank you louder thank you horse for riding us this far  sumalee i cant say anything right in my horse form i can nod  liam horse huffing  matt you do keep your mental stats in beast form ive seen it argued back and forth and im pretty  sure when we had you in your elemental form last campaign people were saying that you could still  technically talk in that form  marisha yeah but i didnt talk as animals i wasnt talking  matt thats right youre unable to actually speak in the /town/ animal form but you can still communicate  marisha as elementals i was like run jump oh shit  sam thats what you are like now  laughter  marisha i reverted thats all  liam keg if we find an alleyway to drop you out of sight of you suddenly appearing can you walk  around this town or is that dangerous  ashly in some places its dangerous theres a place called the trench that the iron shepherds in  this area always hang out in  sam the trench  ashly the trench its in this area /tavern/ its not a huge place right  matt its a fairly decent sized tavern its one of the more populated areas  ashly thats where they hang out  matt every now and then  liam how stupid is it for you to walk up on open road in this place  ashly i think its probably best for me not to be  sam lets go in the brothel were here right we can stay here or we go in here do i have to  fuck somebody in there  ashly why are you worried about this they /none/ would be worried about having to fuck you my man  sam im a lady  ashly my lady i call everyone my man  sam but yes youre right youre right thats a fair point  ashly if any of the marduns are there we might be able to to be honest guys theres not a lot  of options but we might be able to get some help from them i dont know for sure in any case  its a place to regroup this brothel is not in the business of spilling everybodys secrets out  sam /none/ lets go in  liam ja one second though which way from here are these iron chefs located  ashly theyre north of this yes matt the sour nest is  matt the sour nest is northeast of where you are in the city its beyond this city into the  actual savalierwood about maybe two hours travel  liam two hours travel  sam thats their headquarters right  matt beyond the city the northern half of the city is almost entirely within the forest itself  liam okay in that direction  ashly yeah  marisha its in /town/ the walls of the city or in city limits  matt no the sour nest is beyond the city its its own little stronghold that exists separate  from the city itself  liam can you describe to me what it looks like is it noticeable  ashly god what does it look like  matt its noticeable its half a mansion half a small stronghold it has gates around it heavy  walls that have spears atop them  wheels rolling  matt hey youre in a town  sam yeah the caravan just came by  matt its /none/ two story and theres a subterranean basement floor to it they do have hired guard  that keep watch on it while theyre away and occasionally while theyre there i can eventually  provide you with a layout because you would know youve been there a number of times  clomping  sam i love it its so good  sumalee

whisper you and get your information  and get that sent out to you well done getting us back in as you guys step through the archway  the /none/ double doors opening as keg pushes and leads you inside the first thing that hits you is a  fresh smell of lavender a vanilla incense that strikes your senses stinging your eyes with its  potency on the inside you can see a handful of round tables of which two patrons are currently  eating a meal that has been placed before them  ashly i really thought you were going to say something else  sam eating a dead body  matt possibly or a live one you can see candles that are placed at the center there /none/ these fine  silks have been placed its such a stark shift from the dreary and generally muckcovered  exterior of this city to step into what seems oppressively luxurious though the closer you  look everything is frayed at the edges everything seems to have been here for a while or  seems to have been weathered through travel or use the immediate shine begins to fade as you  begin to see how much of this is probably a fair amount of work to keep the upkeep of the facade of  luxury to the left of you /tavern/ you can see a carved windowlike bar or a desk and there behind it you  can see a human man probably in his late 30s his hair very short and the male pattern baldness is  just starting to set in you can see a bit of the shine of the back of his head begin to poke  through he has a very well kept handlebar mustache that curves out very wide to each side of  his face and a pointed van dyke matching beard point that comes to the bottom he has a vest over  /none/ a light green billowing shirt that has a wide collar that curves out to the sides as you enter  and take in he immediately glances over to meet your gaze and goes why hello everyone glad you  could make it welcome welcome to the landlocked lady how could i be of service oh you are a big one  sumalee i am  matt wonderful are you looking for work  ashly no shes not  matt no worries well youre here for a reason i presume do tell me what do you seek we have  rooms /none/ for rent companionship to join as well what do you seeking  marisha well need all of that above and a little bit more  sam well i mean not the companionship  marisha ive had a hard week  sam oh  marisha what were you saying  ashly champ right  matt yes do i know you  sam champ  marisha champ his names champ  ashly maybe his names champ told you it was a shitter yeah you might know me hey are your  bosses around bosses around by any chance  matt my bosses /none/  ashly the people that actually own this place i know you like to pretend  matt are you referring to  ashly the marduns  matt the marduns are not around here today they are at the estate sybaritic  ashly what  matt its their estate its where they live  marisha sybaritic  liam sitaritic  matt sybaritic  ashly do i know where that is  matt youve passed by it youve never been there  ashly is it an insight to see if hes lying  matt yes you may  ashly fuck critical one /none/  matt hes a shifty motherfucker and youre not entirely certain hes telling the truth or not  but seems honest enough lord anselm does pass through on occasion but hes not here today the  rest of them im sure are busy with their own business but if i see any of them i could ask  see if theyre being summoned by what is your name  ashly its um  sam the mighty nein  ashly im trying to come up with a fake name  sam oh  ashly rick  marisha nailed it  ashly /none/ rick is my name  matt make a deception check  laughter  ashly really youre not going to let that slide 19  sumalee rick it is  matt plus  ashly 19 yeah  matt rick very well ill make a note if this is pressing business you are more than welcome to  attempt to summon them at the estate as i know not how often they pass through but in the  meantime you said you wished rooms and company  sam yes well need rooms for sure  matt how many  ashly give us /none/ a second there champ i dont really feel like i want to stay around this guy  that much longer do you guys want to go to this estate or do you want to stay here  sam the estate what would we do there  sumalee i do not like this man  ashly yeah that makes two of us nila i dont know thats where the marduns are you were  looking for them anyway right  sam were looking for one of their family but we dont know enough to march up there and say hey  /none/ were looking for your daughter we dont even know if its a daughter or a niece or something  i dont know  matt all the information that you have from the gentleman is that an individual named ophelia  mardun who is a friend of his he sent you up to give her aid with a problem that shes having  sam we dont know if shes on the outs with her family if theyre the ones who had her killed or  kidnapped we dont know anything wed be marching into a big question mark  marisha maybe /none/ well get lucky and the problem she wants help with is the iron shepherds two  birds with one stone we win still going along with that plan  ashly laughs the plan has not changed  marisha has not changed  ashly its the same plan  marisha the molly problem was a hiccup seems kind of cold anyway  ashly youre working on it  sumalee i have something id like to do now in these moments i have a little bag of treasures  that i smell theyre little treasures that i collect along the way of /none/ things that are  significant and meaningful to me if i smell it it tells me what the experience will be like if  we leave this man and go to this ophelia mardun let me see what my smell check does okay  sam its like telling a fortune but with smelling things all right  marisha thats pretty crazy  ashly is she just getting high  marisha she might be  matt nila pulls up this small pouch with a leather flap on the front and pulling it open  there is within a moment a pungent /none/ smell that is a mixture of earthy almost mossy scents mixed  with spice mixed with rotted vegetation mixed with a bad cheese its a plethora of smells and  they come in waves she buries her nose into this for a second and takes a huge sniffing  sumalee do i know what i sense or will you tell me what i sense  matt make a wisdom check  liam this is what she does in brothels  sam i dont know if she knows what a brothel is  matt add your wisdom modifier  sumalee 17 /none/ oh no wait 14  matt the smell comes into you and amongst the barrage of various smells you catch a rosy sweet  smell that cuts through the rest  sumalee yes we should go to see this ophelia it will be a good outcome  liam you have had a lot of luck predicting things with this stink pouch  sumalee oh yes it is not stinky though you may smell it if you wish  liam what do i smell  matt make a wisdom check  liam oh thats pretty good 19  matt you get /none/ a faint whiff of sawdust that quickly shifts into a very old molded after a  rain leather  liam oh well yes im convinced we should definitely just march up to the estate  ashly wait i want a hit its not going to go well  sumalee i did not know that this works for others  ashly oh yeah its a nine  matt as you get close  sam fart noise  matt you dont even get that close to it you have a fairly strong sense of smell and while  some smells in your /none/ experiences of the world have put you aback you cant even describe this  odorous musk that hits your nostrils causing your entire face to wrinkle and recoil  ashly never mind i was wrong we shouldnt go  matt at this point champ who has leaned forward watching this goes out of my  curiosity im now invested might i have a sniff as well  laughter  sam everyones sniffing your bag  sumalee it is filled with so many wonderful things i promise you wait a minute i do not  want him to smell this  /none/ sam she doesnt want you to smell her bag  matt i didnt want a piece of the stink pouch anyway  sumalee im sorry  sam its something you have to earn maybe tomorrow  sumalee wait let me smell oh all right here  matt sniffs no no lesson learned his eyes start watering would you like a room for the  night what are your preferences  sam maybe we should get a room or two that way if everything goes wrong if were indeed going to  go to this estate then we could at least /none/ have somewhere to crash  matt i must warn you if its more to a room and you require a companion the group rates are a bit  more expensive  ashly he means slumber parties if we all want to have a nice rest together just sleeping its  more money  sumalee we have that in my clan too we all set up a huge nest of leaves and sleep together  matt are you sure youre not looking for work  sumalee no  marisha maybe we shouldnt stay here what time of day is it  /none/ matt at this point its almost dusk you guys have traveled the better part of your second day  to even get here  liam well perhaps we dont want to show up on these peoples doorstep as the sun is going down  why dont we spend a night here you were looking for some companionship you can work on that  sam we can ask around maybe the clientele might know some things about the sheps  ashly thats not a bad idea  liam sure we can talk to the clientele maybe you should hang back  /town/ sam i think i fit in in this town but they might recognize me  liam how do you mean  sam no i mean the iron shepherds know my face but it seems like theres so many weirdos in this  town that i dont know no one seemed to be looking at me funny when we walked in oh wait i  was dressed as a gnome thats why never mind  laughter  marisha to be fair this isnt the iron shepherds hideout we said right  liam yeah thats outside of the city into the woods /town/  marisha seems like they wouldnt come here rival family  ashly is it safe to say that they keep to themselves  matt for the most part yeah they only come into town to occasionally drink and essentially parade  dominance every now and then checking in to assert their reputation and if they have to do  other bits of dirty work they are slavers by normal trade but they do other things for the  jagentoths if need be  ashly they wouldnt feel it necessary to tell anyone else about us  matt youre not entirely /none/ certain it depends on if they assume theyre being chased or they feel  like the demonstration was enough but you dont know  ashly all right  sam spend the night here then  liam yeah i think so weve been traveling all day we stay here we get up we dont know  anything about where the shepherds we know nothing about their stronghold just what youre  able to tell us but that doesnt tell us how many people are there now what we are going to be up  against we talk to the marduns tomorrow /none/ figure out the next step from there  marisha yeah lets formulate a plan in the morning i cant think right now im a little out  of it  ashly all right champ she sleeps alone no funny business all right  matt of course not i have a business to run  sumalee thank you  marisha ill take a room for myself please  matt all right for a singular room rate for the night that will be one gold five silver  marisha i arrange for companionship and drinks  matt any preference of companion we /none/ have a spectrum to choose from  marisha it feels weird going and picking someone out that feels dirty  matt would you prefer it a surprise  marisha yeah just make her hot please  matt her that is a preference very well goes and writes something down can be done for a  nights companionship do you wish just for an evenings stay or for the night over  marisha no just an hour and then i want to be alone please  matt that will be an additional five gold pieces  marisha all right then i /tavern/ get really drunk and i go to my room for the night send up booze  matt an additional five silver just racking up the tab then the rest of you  sam well have a room by ourselves  matt the four of you  sam oh no i mean  sumalee i dont mind staying with you  ashly no were fine just sleeping  matt very well suit yourself but ill be here for most of the night if you change your mind  ashly unless no judgment if you want to  liam no we have /town/ been together a long time so were used to  ashly oh youre together  liam sure  sam not like that  ashly oh okay i was going to say i think you could do better but anyway  liam i dont know if that was called for at all  ashly sorry  sam no youre absolutely right he is handsome and he could do much better than a little  freakshow like me he could meet any girl in town and sweep her off her feet  liam shush this one and myself will take one room /none/  ashly ill go with nila then  matt all right two per room thats two gold for the group rate so four gold for the two  additional rooms please  liam i will handle the two gold for nott and myself  ashly ill do the two gold for us  matt all right he gives a key to each of you for each room  sumalee thank you i was going to give it for us but next time  ashly no problem  liam oh boy  sam what do you have any gold left  /none/ liam sure im good  ashly sorry nott youre a great gal its the occasional tongueeating is mostly what i was  referring to  liam you know maybe quit while youre ahead nott come on lets go upstairs  matt you guys all scatter to your separate chambers and find yourselves a as restful as it  can be given the events recently nights sleep beau drunkenly you have enough consciousness to  recall eventually a knock at your door  marisha oh right i open the door  matt standing there you see an amberskinned elven woman a /none/ little older than you with very  bright almost platinum hair that is pulled up into a high ponytail that drifts past the  shoulders seeming a very sheer negligee  marisha uhh hi  sam looking up the spell  liam no something else youre good go on get it on  marisha whats your name  matt vorsah she pushes you in the room and closes the door  marisha okay  matt cut to black  sumalee nila was going to cover her ears  liam youre probably nailing a 250yearold  marisha hot  sam oh /town/ elven aging cougar  marisha yeah exactly  matt singing heres to you mrs robinson the morning eventually comes some of you more  hungover than others but as you come to and gather yourselves and wash for the coming day you  hear the sounds of almost broken roosters outside they call this horrible terrible its a harsh  north this side of wildemount for these poor birds  liam welcome to deadwood  matt this is very much the deadwood of the continent you can already hear the town coming  alive outside the occasional shouts youre unable /none/ to make out the words but the morning has  definitely kicked in you gather your things and make your way down to the bottom floor where champ  is not currently there theres somebody else looks to be a younger man probably in his late  teens early 20s he appears to be halfelven with this curly mop of brightred hair on the top  and a smile and hes currently going through a ledger of some kind  ashly do i recognize him  matt you do not  sam his name is rex  sumalee rick and /none/ rex  liam before going down with nott and caleb i would say when we get up we need to talk for a  minute okay  sam listen you should just forgive keg she doesnt know that she was being insulting shes  rough around the edges and shes right you could do better than me look at this this is a  mess i mean the teeth  liam i dont care about keg or any of that i want to talk about what you and i are doing  sam all right  liam i was this /town/ close to running off from that road when things turned on us you and i we are  going to survive together that is the main thing  sam why didnt you run  liam the dwarf stepped up snaps changed my mind like that  sam changed your mind because we had extra help or  liam whatever she said to him he left  sam oh the danger was passed  liam yeah  sam mmhmm  liam but we have done a lot and you know what i am about  sam of course i do yes /none/  liam so i just want you and i you and me especially to be on the same page because we have  been for months now ja you are my friend i want you to be with me and i want us to live we  have done a lot with these people and if we can finesse this and do it in a way that does not  throw our lives in the fire there is more to be achieved we will help you get to where you want  to get and myself together we will work /none/ together with these people  sam i know that you want revenge for what that man did to you and theres things i want too  but mollymauk was amazing showed me something he had this spirit of life that was pretty  outstanding you know he was the moment that we all traveled together he came up and we were all  talking and all cagey and all iffy with each other when we met all these folks but he said  hey want to come see a circus show and that lit the spark right  liam yes /none/  sam but before that it was all im saying is he was a rainbow man who represented life at its  fullest and thats what i want even more than what we were going for before together were  sort of living life now arent we before we were in the darkness so i know we have things to  do and i want to do them but the reason i want to find these people and rescue them is not to use  them and its not because weve invested time in them but its because i love /none/ them we need to  find them and rescue them because were a team now so if youre just using them or whatever  thats fine and ill support you but i want to find them so that we dont go back to the way it  was when we were hiding in the shadows and ducking into alleys to get away from people we  were safe but we werent really alive right with these people were having fun and winning  contests and killing bad guys and rescuing children and its amazing i hope youre with me  /none/ on that and i hope we are on the same page  liam i like them  sam thats a good start i think they like you  liam we are not hiding anymore well not like we used to there is a certain amount of risk to what  we are doing and what i want is good for more people than just me  sam i know it is and i want it for you weve used a lot of people in the past and i just want  to make sure were not using these folks are /none/ we  liam well we are about to risk our lives to pull three people we met four or five weeks ago out of  the hands of a lot of dangerous people seems like a pretty good offer for them  sam okay  liam i dont have any family youre the closest thing that i have i have come to rely on you and  i am grateful for your company  sam i couldnt do this without you  liam well lets screw our courage to the sticking place and get them out of there  sam /none/ yes lets get them home and lets kill lorenzo i have an idea i know my last one didnt  go so well but listen we cant fight these people ive said it before and ill say it again  but what we can do is exactly what they do they go out and pick off people one at a time why  dont we start doing that to them follow them track them see where they go home at night and  just pick them off one at a time the weaker ones first and by the time lorenzo /none/ knows whats  happening hell be scared out of his mind  liam he would get more defensive with time i dont know we dont know enough i would like to  find out where he sleeps  sam okay  liam headon i agree not a good idea we will take a roundabout way lets figure out what were  talking about first  sam all right to breakfast  liam i invite her in  sam ill nestle in  liam i dont even say anything just a firm hug lets go down  matt as both nila /none/ and keg have enjoyed a decent meal not as much as youd expect for the money  that was paid included for the evenings stay but a meal nevertheless  marisha hotel prices what  liam sex bacon  laughter  matt eventually caleb and nott make their way down to join you  ashly when keg sees nott she pulls out a piece of paper and some broken spectacles and says nott  sam whats this what are you doing  ashly im sorry i said that you were not good enough for  sam why are you wearing /none/ those things  ashly im trying to apol just give me a second im sorry i said you were not good enough for caleb  sam did someone tell you to do this  ashly youre very nice im trying to be nice just give this is as painful for me as it is for  you just give me five seconds  sam sure sure  ashly im sorry i was mean  sam can we get some hash browns or something  ashly you may be kind of weird but youre also nice  sam i dont think /none/ there was a verb in that sentence  ashly i am sorry and when you arent eating tongue youre sort of cute love keg  sam okay so a few things  ashly do you have notes  sam i mean you dont need to sign it if youre saying  ashly i dont know i was writing it i didnt know if i was going to say it to you or give it to  you so i panicked and i im sorry  marisha beau comes down the stairs hearing the end of it and just goes applause /dung/  ashly thanks beau  marisha i could learn a few things from you that was a good apology damn good  sam apology accepted dont worry about it i have a thick skin about this stuff and i know i  havent put my best foot forward with you we got off on a wrong foot to a brighter tomorrow  ashly that was much more eloquent than mine was  sam i just made that up i didnt even have to write it down  ashly you didnt even have to write it down  sam no  /none/ ashly fuck im so bad at this and then she shoves bacon in her mouth  matt all right so whats your plan  liam long sigh we are going to go and meet the marduns  sam okay  liam we are going to ask for ophelia mardun  marisha i have a feeling maybe her business has something to do with the iron shepherds as well  liam maybe  ashly we can hope  marisha do you know anything about any of the families here  sumalee i do not nila would like to gather these goodberries /none/ and on the way out give one to each  of those horrible sounding roosters  laughter  matt perfect  sumalee they need help  matt as nilas out there healing the roosters and youre leaving the young curly redhaired  halfelven proprietor at the front leans forward and says im sorry i dont mean to intrude but  whatever it is youre after good luck and i hope youre on the right track  ashly who the hell are you  sam thats super weird he seems like a nice normal person here  marisha is it a /none/ female  matt sorry im keelyn i take the early shift here its a man vibrant green eyes but ive  overheard youre going to see the marduns just listen carefully  sam listen carefully  matt listen carefully  sam like while we walk there we should listen  matt as you listen and talk with them  sam oh  liam oh not right now but when we are ja  marisha well i imagine we should also be listening carefully right now as well as then  matt that works as well but  sam whats wrong /none/ with them what should we know  matt nothing theyre gracious employers i enjoy my time here but just listen carefully im  trying to help thats all good day be off be off  sam no i know but why we havent paid you okay  liam its very enigmatic but we will okay  matt good luck takes a little glass of tea and sips it  ashly can i do an insight check on him to see if hes sketchy  matt yeah go for it hes pretty sketchy  ashly i mean yeah but sketchy in /none/ the well eight like is he trying to fuck with us  liam where are your 20s ashly where are your 20s  ashly i know i wasted them all  matt its hard to read he seems forthright enough but also guarded its hard to tell  ashly okay  sam how long have you been working for the marduns  matt me about six seven months  sam do you like the work  matt i mean it has its benefits  sam you mean like  ashly nott  matt be on your way and good luck /none/ sips the tea again  marisha thats totally what he means  sam what are those marks all over your neck  marisha badge of honor  sam did you get in a fight last night  ashly nott for real man context clues  marisha i mean you could say it was a nice little tussle it was a nice little square off  sam who won  marisha id say we both won  sam simultaneously  marisha i definitely won i won a few times  laughter  sam cool cool cool  laughter  sumalee nila /none/ will offer you another goodberry too  marisha ooh do they make my hickies go away  matt they definitely seem to recede a bit  marisha holy shit this is miracle cream nila oh my god  matt a use for goodberries ive not yet seen in my years playing dd  marisha you could make a cosmetic line  matt all right as you make your way back into the streets of the city you begin to make your way  back into the clover plaza now do you know where youre going  ashly do i know /none/ a lot  matt youve not been to these estates specifically because your employers are  diametrically opposed to the marduns but you know the vague idea of where it is but youve never  traveled there you could probably ask around if youd like if you were to search for somebody who  would hopefully be of help  ashly could we have asked that guy  matt you can go back and ask  ashly should we go back and ask the creepy guy  sam i mean he seems to know them i guess so  ashly /town/ one more thing  sam were going to go back and ask the creepy guy how to get to the marduns  ashly keelyn  matt hi again  ashly hi we should have asked this before we left the first time do you know where their  estate is  matt youre looking for them and you dont know where they are  ashly yeah man  matt northwest outskirts of the town limits within the forest look for the dark red wood exterior  ashly okay  matt youll find it i trust  ashly why are you /town/ helping us  matt because this place is a shithole and decent people are hard to find  liam well let you know if we find them come on  matt all right you guys head out into the streets and now its interesting as you head  out into the plaza its much busier than it was towards the evening you were here before you see  a small regiment of people armored geared up weapons  crowd sound effects  marisha how does he do that  ashly the timing  liam where does he get such wonderful /none/ toys  matt battlebards and syrinscape you glance and see 20 or so of these figures all in various  types of armor and weapons theyre in lines ramshackle it resembles something military but  by people who arent trained by military or at least have any interest in that type of regimented  standing you see at glance a few empire soldiers three in full armor not crownsguard  but from the actual military that are inspecting up and down the line  marisha is it like a militia that theyre forming  matt it looks to be you /none/ recognize most of the folks here to be grudge gang  ashly okay  matt you have a question  liam there is a difference between crownsguard and empire soldiers is one higher than the other  matt well theres the military the crownsguard are essentially the general guardians of every  township and they do day to day law enforcement  marisha and sam cops  matt the actual military soldiers you saw gathering on the outskirts of zadash when the war  first kicked in and passed one of the large armies traveling eastward from up by the /none/ western  side of the silberquel ridge  liam yeah i dont think weve ever discussed this but is calebs father crownsguard or empire  matt no your father would have been lowlevel military  liam which is below both of those  matt no its slightly above crownsguard  liam okay  ashly theyre the grudge gang that we see  matt yes and watching as you pass by you get the sense that it looks like the empire is hiring  mercenaries for the war  ashly okay  matt coasting around the north side you tell the /town/ group to make a wide berth outside of the trench  which is on the northern end of the plaza following the directive of keelyn you start  weaving toward whats called north clover clover street youve now begun to note is the large  central street that is the one throughline of the entire city it runs all around the treeline of  the savalierwood its strange and not straight in places and it was designed to follow the southern  border of this forest the northern side of it north clover is built directly into this forest  /none/ you know make a history check actually caleb you can make a history check too  ashly 17  matt not bad that works youve been at this for a while the savalierwood has been cursed for many  centuries the oncegreen forest now stands a greyish purple ashen color that it now holds and  the superstition and mythology around it has allowed the city of shadycreek run to prevent  empire encroachment they built the city into the space and every time the empire has attempted to  move forward theyve pulled back and used it as a /none/ defensive position essentially over a number of  conflicts the empire just gave up and let the region exist on its own it is dangerous the  wood the deeper in the more dangerous it gets  ashly and the sour nest is nestled into it  matt its nestled into the forest even further north of where the city stops in the forest  continuing on you begin to enter the canopy of the south savalierwood the shade completely consumes  the city at this point even though its midmorning and the clouds are broken up so that  /none/ occasional bits of warmth and sunlight would occasionally pass through the city now it seems  like its almost dusk immediately occasionally you see a leaf tumble past and then another its  almost beautiful the color but it does have almost a decaying sense to its meeting between  grey and purple its beautiful in light and then when it hits the ground it almost looks like its  bereft of life you dont understand the nature of this enchantment whatever this curse may be that  youve heard of  marisha nila is there something wrong with the /none/ soil here or something do you know anything about this  sumalee i dont like the look of it feels bad do i have something that can tell do you know  laughter  liam well youre not familiar with this where you are from  sumalee no no  marisha you could do a general nature check  matt you could do a nature check if you wanted to try  sumalee i wanted to use druidcraft but i dont know  liam roll one of your buddies  sumalee plus eight  liam 14  marisha no no /none/ eight total  sumalee its right this roll plus two  matt correct yeah this is beyond you in all of your experience and youre very connected with  the land of the valley this far north youve not encountered something like this the forest the  best you can tell the forest still lives the nature of where it draws its life and this color  is very unnatural and it spooks you  sumalee is it like a halfdead forest like a  matt it feels alive and you pick up the leaf that you saw tumbled before /none/ you and you feel it and it  still brims with health it also offputs you you get chills and you dont know why  sumalee i dont need to check my smell bag for this  marisha all right  matt i think stink pouch is still my favorite phrase  sumalee stink pouch fine  matt no smell bag is great  sam odor sack  ashly its somehow worse than stink pouch as far as what it evokes  liam sniff nuts  sumalee are there any animals  matt make a perception check  marisha what /none/ was the name of the forest  sumalee ooh it hit that does that count can i roll again  matt it still counts yeah unfortunately  sumalee eight  matt you dont see anything specifically you do hear birds so it isnt bereft of wildlife at  least you get the sense that there is at least a symbiotic relationship with some wildlife in the  bit of the forest youve been in  sumalee id love to take one of my goodberries to draw one of the birds and see if i might talk with  it and /none/ see if it could tell us anything about before  matt make an animal handling check  sam ooh what is this druid stuff  sumalee 12 plus seven 19  matt as you hold the goodberry out which with your arm length is a good nine nine and a half  feet up towards the lower hanging branches and you bird song give a little counterwhistle to  the sound of one of the birds you hear you hear a retort bird whistle and you return it bird  whistle and then it returns bird whistle flutter and then /none/ down onto the edge of your hand  you see this tiny little blackbird with a white stripe that goes down the edge of each wing it  chirping and starts eating the goodberry messing the edge of its beak  liam  giant shitty rooster  ashly squawk  matt its eating the goodberry what would you like to do  sumalee what would we like to ask it  sam first thing that pops into my mind is do you know kiri but i dont think thats relevant  marisha you have to stop thinking that all people /none/ who look like each other know everybody  sam dont they though  marisha no  sam all right maybe how long has this curse been here how long has the forest been  spookyooky  marisha do they know how much further the marduns keep is  sam are there any monsters out there  sumalee thats too much one at a time how long has the forest been like this  matt are you using a spell or are you using your firbolg ability  sumalee oh im using my firbolg ability  matt that allows you to /none/ speak to animals  sumalee oh yes i have to use a spell sorry wait which one is it  liam and sam wait  sumalee do you know which one it is  marisha and liam speak with animals  sumalee speech of the woods  ashly nilas just staring at this bird  matt speech of the woods is your firbolg ability  sumalee oh i know i have it  matt if you look on your spell list the cards you have prepared do you have speak with animals prepared  sumalee i know i have it /none/ oh its because i chose my spirit totem  matt oh right because youre shepherd  sumalee yes i have  matt yes you do because youre circle of the shepherd  sumalee whew  marisha you got this  sumalee i was like i set this all up and then im not going to be able to talk to the bird  liam shes an iron shepherd kill her  matt you get to mark off one of your 1stlevel spells as you ask the bird the bird returns  and you guys hear her whistle to the bird /none/ and the bird whistles back quite a bit this beautiful  song that plays the bird conveys to you far far before my time  sumalee it says its been this way a long time  marisha wow i mean how long is long for a bird though  sam they only live for three weeks right thats probably a bad question  sumalee this bird lives a long time i can tell you this type of bird is not a shortlived bird  marisha dagon can live to be 30 shes going to outlive us all  liam would /none/ you like to ask it what is dangerous in the wood  sumalee yes what is most dangerous here  matt be wary of spirits  marisha ooh spirits  matt be wary of bonespurred beasts  marisha bonespurred beasts okay  ashly doesnt sound great  sumalee what other questions are you still willing to answer some more  matt how long does the spell last  liam three days  ashly the birds a party member now  matt it lasts for ten minutes  marisha ooh yeah  sam how far are we from the mardun house /none/ i dont know if the bird is going to know  sumalee i dont think the the bird would know the mardun house  sam well we can describe it red wood house  marisha mansion  sam red wood mansion  sumalee oh all right  marisha northwestish  sumalee id like to send the bird mentally the picture of what that birds eye view would be and  to see if the bird has seen that  matt okay you focus and express mentally and through small verbal gestures towards it the idea  of this color and /town/ this shape immediately the bird flapping takes off  marisha and sam gasp follow the bird  matt you guys all start keeping up and jogging behind it you watch as it goes flapping and it  lands on a post lands on a little roof looks back at you whistling flapping and its  waiting and showing you a path through these streets in doing so youre dodging past  originally when you walked in there were broken down tent cities and hovels and not a good space  here the road and alleys break down its more sparse /town/ the buildings are further apart its less  of like a gridded city and more of a cluster of buildings that are generally more well made and  you get the sense that this is the wealthier area you in your experience know that the north clover  is where most of the tribes the different ruling families exist and claim their territory you  move past a couple of buildings eventually the bird bringing you to a beautiful twostory estate  thats in the beginning stages of showing disrepair the darkred wood appears imported and  the tall stone /none/ fence that encircles the building is topped with sixinch spear tips a few that  look bent and off kilter but still dangerous enough for somebody who wished to try and leap the  six sevenfoot fence the courtyard houses a once beautiful garden that now turns grey with the  winter you can see rose bushes that have since browned and withered but the roses still slowly  left there to dry and lose color you can see in the center of this courtyard a small fountain of  some kind but now its filled with slushed snow and /none/ here the bits of the snow that have been  pushed off the streets give way to this estate thats glaring now at the outskirts of the forest  you can see beyond it its just wood this definitely marks at least at this part of  shadycreek run the end of the city before you begin to crest into the savalierwood itself there  are three individuals that are wearing simple chain mail that are walking inside the courtyard  one has a crossbow at their side the other has a shortbow across their shoulder one is sitting  /none/ looking out the other looks like theyre eating some sort of dried meat from a pouch and they  glance over and watch as you approach and keep an eye  marisha do they look like taskers do they have the same armor  matt theyre not taskers no  marisha okay  sam theyre probably just guarding the place  marisha hired hands  sam does someone want to go talk to them  liam ja that is not a problem hello  matt the one thats sitting stands up and puts his crossbow like ready not pointing it /none/ at you but  liam ja we are good here  matt what is your intent here  liam we have been traveling a great distance we are here to speak if you dont mind we have a  message for ophelia mardun it can only be heard by her we have been charged with this message and  no funny business i hope that we could impart our message and be done  matt i can take your message and pass it on  liam would you tell her that a very refined gentleman from the south would like /none/ to pass his  regards to her  matt make a persuasion check  liam ja groans  sam southern accent a southern gentleman  liam not very good at all  sam and ashly groan  matt he goes and theres five of you  liam it is a long way  marisha and an important message  liam yeah only a fool travels alone  matt ill pass on the message youll be summoned if necessary but clicks tongue gives  a motion over to the other guard whos finished eating whos also pulled the shortbow off the /none/  shoulder and has knocked an arrow into it gives a whistle and the doors to the estate open and you  watch as three more guards emerge with crossbows and one with a heavy crossbow at the ready they  all keep them at the ready very close eye one of them begins to patrol the outside of the building  you get the sense immediately that theres a general anxiety and tension at this space when  strangers approach theyre being very careful  marisha can i look around do i see anybody whos hidden watching from windows /none/ up above anything  that looks like were being watched  matt make a perception check  marisha not by guards necessarily 21  matt you glance up and on the second floor there is two sets of double windows theyre paned one  of them looks to be partially opened and you can see on the inside there are curtains one the  curtains are closed the other is drawn to a side and you see a figure looking out below as soon as  you look up and see it the curtain closes  marisha did i catch /dung/ a glimpse of what the figure looks like  matt the figure looked to be human though the skin was dark thats as best as you can get  before they vanished  marisha okay  liam im just smiling at the guards  matt you see all the other guards each place one of their weapons pointed directly at each of you  and the quiet comes over all of you as this moment this standoff continues for a minute two  minutes as the first guard that you spoke to enters and closes the door behind  liam /none/ exhales  ashly so do you like being guards  matt shh one of them tightens the grip  ashly got it  matt this large heavy crossbow already notched backward and the tension on the wire itself is  this guy is looking like he is ready to fire  liam we are all going to laugh about this later i promise nervous laugh  matt a moment later the guard emerges from the door all right stand down  sam oh  matt they all pull their weapons away looking disappointed  liam we are good  matt /none/ open the gate the guard who was eating earlier puts the shortbow over the shoulder  still looking wary and theyre not moving from where theyre standing theyre all keeping a very  close eye on all five of you opens the gate clicking creaking the metallic gate swings  open and youre all brought into the courtyard as youre begin to follow the first guard you  spoke with they all slowly coalesce behind you still keeping their weapons at the side but ready  if need be as youre led to the interior chamber of this estate the /none/ estate sybaritic as soon as  you enter the main foyer the earthy smell of the forest gives way to the lingering scent of a  recent meal as if the cooked meats and starches that were eaten maybe an hour or two beforehand  still permeate the air of this entryway you see before you a staircase that continues upward red  carpeted before switching back to a second floor in that center landing you can see a very open  window that looks down to possibly a backyard of some kind but currently the view is of the /none/  darkened leaves and bits of sunlight that break through it seems like something that was built  for a beautiful view not understanding until it was completed that it didnt really catch much of  a view amongst this forest like the original builder had brought sensibilities from outside to  bring them in and it was not compatible with this landscape there you see to the left and right of  you art pieces that depict people you can see individuals of different backgrounds and you see  one that appears to be of pure elven blood with /none/ brown hair difficult to make out the gender but  beautiful and standing very robust with a chin out and a wily grin oils very well done to the left  of you you can see the other portrait appears to be a woman with a very well made dress with these  large almost puffs at the shoulders it seems almost trying too hard to be aristocratic  its garish but here you are a moment later the door closes behind you and youre still  being flanked by this bevy of guards you hear the heavy footsteps coming /none/ down the staircase turning  the corner you see a figure now framed in what little of the light is coming through that window  behind them footfalls stepping down you see a woman darkgray skin and anklelength black hair  that is smooth and straight that falls behind her you see bony crests of horns that curve up into  these two large points behind the head and bright yellow eyes that are pupilless a grin that shows  two fanged canines as she descends you can see her attire is very formal colonial style coat  with epaulets /none/ but it seems to be tailored to not hide her figure she already exudes an air of  powerful aggression and presence with each step that she takes down there you can sense her  immediately reading and seeing in and through each of you quietly she takes the last step to the  landing here in the foyer german accent you bring tidings from the gentleman you say  liam that is correct ja  matt well you have invoked the name of my comrade you have my attention do not squander  it why are you here  /none/ liam well we will be plain he has sent us he has told us that you are in need of assistance  and he has deemed us worthy to provide it  sam are you ophelia  matt i am  sam oh just making sure  marisha yeah thats good  sam it could be someone else  matt thorough i appreciate that well so you are the help that he sent timely three days  earlier would have been better but here we are i shall not fret on it thank you for coming be at  ease /none/ go watch the back walls make sure nobody tries to sneak in while were talking the guards  all scatter except for two who stay posted at each side of the door behind you how much have  you been told  liam small laugh not very much  matt you watch as her eyes looks you from head to toe and her tongue runs across her lip a bit  sighs ive had an open line of shipments to zadash through our mutual friend for some time  made a beneficial arrangement for many years  marisha can i /none/ do an insight check did it look like she cast a spell just then  matt sure make an insight check  marisha 25  sam oh whispers  sam and ashly whispers  liam fireball  laughter  sam guys  liam and sam dd beyond  liam am i right  sam is a really good app  ashly flatly its so great  liam its like i can be on the shitter if i want to check  sam you can customize that  liam calebs spells  ashly i can  matt oh god  sam /none/ you can with their new upgrade  liam i can be mid dook  sam you can be mid dook  liam mid dook and check my spells  sam youre mid dook right now  matt anyway bringing it back in  marisha shipments to zadash  matt however my most trusted team of smugglers that handle that route and knew it well were slain  a little over a month ago  sam do you know by whom  matt well at first we thought it was maybe the dire beasts of the wood around us but our /none/  internal priest was able to divine the source of their demise in other words at the hands of the jagentoths  sam the who what  ashly its the family that controls the iron shepherds  sam the jagendoths  ashly the jagentoths  matt now weve as you seem to know this well she looks over you you look familiar what is  your name  ashly keg  matt keg i know that name  ashly i used to work for them not anymore  matt at which point you hear the guards behind cocking crossbow the /none/ crossbows go back up into  position you glance over your shoulder to see them both pointed what assurances can i have  that i not need strike you down where you stand  ashly you dont have any but i have a lot of information about them  sam we just killed one of them  ashly oh thats true thats better we killed one of them  matt make a persuasion check with advantage  ashly that is a 12  matt intriguing very well they go down sighing we and these jagentoths have feuded for  quite /none/ some time between these tribes many times it has come to bloodshed but now with the grudge  gang and the taskers making open justice throughout the realm messy we must take to other  means we cannot deliver our retribution with hands that can be traced back to us as this  affects both the marduns and the gentleman he is wise to send you and this kindness shall be  repaid in person the jagentoths have slaughtered and stolen from us a major source of contraband  and income its only fair we do the same in kind /town/ we here of the estate sybaritic require you to cut  one of the limbs of their business kill their best handymen hunt the iron shepherds  liam one more time please  matt hunt the iron shepherds  liam your accent is thick  matt i have not been as far south as some of you i can tell  liam no i appreciate hearing the old tongue again  matt she says to you in zemnian well stick around in common last i heard they are still  out on the road they live at the sour nest /none/ a small stronghold not far from here on the edge of  north clover to the eastern side they have a number of hired hands that guard the locale its  a difficult infiltration but its your best chance of catching them off guard if you have  other ideas we are open to suggestions am i to believe that you have been sent and her eyes  fall over nila as trained killers able to deal with this  liam some of us are trained killers for sure and we have picked up help as we have seen fit /none/  everyone has been carefully selected carefully vetted im sure that with your input on their  mannerisms and habits their routines we will do quite well  matt all right let us hope that the priest was not incorrect either way i would like to see  them taken down a peg so do you accept this offer  marisha what all do you want us getting out of that house  matt nothing to get out of it kill everything within it  ashly when you say this cant get traced back to you guys does that mean /none/ you cant help us at all  give us any assistance as far as your men firepower nothing  matt no we can offer maybe a bit of change to grease a few palms or bring some aid your way but  we cannot be traced to this at all this needs to seem unrelated a strange occurrence a random act  of murder was in their home so as not to quell this already boiling blood between us  marisha you think all of the iron shepherds will be there  matt well i dont know theyre there often /none/ but if youve made it this far north perhaps you  are better at finding this information than we  liam we have come a long way is there any you know them better than us were outoftowners  any tips to specifically deal with your problem  matt best intel we have involves that they hire their mercenaries from the grudge gang they  prefer to find people with keen eyes and distant shot  sam the grudge gang theyve hired the entire gang or just the members of the  matt just members of the gang  sam /town/ where do they hang about  matt all over the city but the ones theyve hired will probably stay within the estate  sam they would stay there while theyre under the employ of the iron shepherds  matt of course that is what i do she refers to the two guards behind you  marisha do you know sorry you can go  ashly you said that theyre still on the road youre led to believe that they havent come back  to shadycreek run yet  matt i havent seen them return yet no  sam would you /town/ know if they came back do you have spies out there looking  matt i have  sam because we saw them on the road and they were heading back here  matt if they have arrived recently perhaps my whispers have not come to me yet  ashly theres a chance the sour nest is empty or less guarded  marisha i wonder if theyre hiring  sam does the grudge gang identify themselves in some way how would we find one  matt they usually and she pulls back her sleeve and you can see the dark gray /none/ almost black  skin there beneath you will find a burned crescent into the wrist of a member of the gang  sam lets get a fireplace and some iron and burn the shit out of our wrists and then were  instagrudge gang now the gentleman has us on a meager yearly salary but if we were to do this  for you does that include some sort of bonus  matt are you saying the gentleman has not paid you for this endeavor  sam not yet  matt i was made to understand that that was all /none/ taken care of as part of our arrangement  marisha how about something in trade just as a little added bonus as a favor  matt what are you asking for if i might inquire little girl she leans forward with this  creepy smile that crawls across her face as she eyes you up and down  liam there we go  marisha kind of like her demeaning me with that little girl stuff im kind of into it anyway  that priest you mentioned is he a pretty skilled priest would he happen to have any skills in /none/  reviving the dead  matt you have a problem with someone beneath the earth i do not know if our priest specializes in  such abilities and if they did it would be for family only  marisha sounds like he does specialize in those abilities when you put it like that if exceptions  can be made for friends and family friends and family discount is a real thing  matt youre mighty presumptuous you might have better luck with any of the wandering crazies in  the city  marisha what  matt our priest is not /town/ the only one she cocks her head if youre looking for help could look  to the blooming grove  sam wheres that whats that is that a town  matt its about six miles out of shadycreek run to the northwest a little farther from here its  a burial grove but there is a temple there and some strange hermit of a priest is said to live  there most folks are spooked of them the family that once looked over that grove has slowly  dwindled as the years have gone on and they say the curse /none/ itself seems to hold it but try that  otherwise you need to do quite a favor for us as such magic is not inexpensive  ashly killing all of the iron shepherds isnt a big enough favor  matt youve already been paid for that  liam yeah this is a preexisting arrangement thats outside of negotiation at the moment i  understand we will take care of what you are asking  matt good thats what i like straightforward and working to the fine print very good  liam zemnian  sam all right you dont want us /none/ staying here i suppose we should scoot out so that we cant be  traced back to you  matt well lead you out the back route eyes on you leaving my estate would be unwise so begins  speaking in zemnian to the two other guards youre the only one who picks up on the language  says please lead them through the back tunnel she turns around and begins to ascend the stairs  stopping and looking back over her shoulder the hair swishing with each step as she makes her way  up looking back and the /none/ yellow eyes glancing back with the bright white teeth against the  darkened skin do not disappoint me i can be very frustrated when im disappointed turns back  and makes her way back up the steps  liam were left with guards  matt two guards yes  liam all right good fellows would you escort us out and point us in the right direction  matt they wordlessly walk and lead you around through a dining chamber back to a small storage  itd be kitchen adjacent though you dont see a kitchen yet you can smell that /town/ musty scent of  stored oats and grains rice  liam did i see any books on the way out  matt make a perception check  liam 14  matt none down here none of the rooms you were brought through seem to have any sort of a shelf  unit or anything that carries tomes or books of any kind unfortunately  liam fuck this podunk town  matt there doesnt seem to be very wellread people though therere probably some youre led  into this storage room and down a staircase through a trapdoor its pulled open /none/ youre led  into this wine cellar and in the back of the wine cellar they move aside a case shelving for wine  and theyre all resting on it some missing others moving it there theres a small tunnel  that you all have to duck down you have to nearly crawl through to get your rather large firbolg form  ashly can i sleight of hand and try to steal some wine  matt sure  marisha i was about to ask if i recognize any wine  matt youre moving pretty fast make a perception check  /dung/ marisha okay  ashly maybe i shouldnt  sam oh its too late now  ashly oh its great 18  matt whatd you get  marisha nine  matt unfortunately you cant see any of the labels the way its rested however you do manage  to grab a bottle of wine  sam ooh is that a cabernet sauvignon  matt you guys are brought through singlefile through this tunnel until eventually met with  another door the guard knocking does some sort of pulsed knock it opens and from this completely  dark interior the light hits /tavern/ your eyes and you have to adjust for a moment its really not that  bright on the opposite side its still within the forest comparatively it hits you as you step  out there looks to be an older drunk dirty filthylooking man who is completely sober and  lets you out  marisha thats cool  matt you are now in the middle of the forest and you can see a small bench and an overgrown well  about ten or so feet ahead and to the left of you that vines have completely taken over the vines /none/  themselves a similar purplegrayish color as to the rest of the leaves a lot of the foliage seems  to fall into that same coloration not all of it but a lot of it it seems to cross multiple types  of vegetation as youre escorted from this room the two guards give a nod close it behind you  the old man goes and sits back puts his bench up against the knotted base of a thick tree thats  growing out of the ground where you had emerged from leans against it grabs a jug and sits /none/ and  looks at you  ashly can i tell where the sour nest would be from here  matt make a survival check  ashly 18  matt with how far youve traveled north it would be straight due east from here  ashly okay sour nest is east of here  liam you know where you are  sam should we go run recon take a quick scouting pass and see what we can see  liam yeah lets put a little distance between ourselves and this place and this gentleman and i  will send frumpkin out /none/ to have a look  sam okay  matt you make your way through the savalierwood  sam is it a long walk or a long travel  matt from where you are now its probably a two hour walk its the far east side its  technically past the lets see i have all the locations here pardon me as i pull out my notes  liam while you look i will say an important point for clarification once we are out of the  view of this gentleman guarding the secret entrance caleb walking with poise up to /none/ a tree  leans against it bends down and has a panic attack  sam you were in great in there  matt past the gruff slum is what it is this is the far eastern side of it  ashly past the gruff stump  matt the gruff slum  sam you were great you handled yourself so well man you were rocksolid in there  liam stop it i am nauseous lets go kill a bunch of people  sam give him a goodberry  sumalee i have a goodberry  marisha oh yes  liam that is /none/ sour  sam its a purin tablet  sumalee one moment it will take effect soon  ashly oh end that way  marisha keep it down  liam lets go  matt it does warm your belly and that warmth spreads through your torso and its whenever  jester has come and pulled you from the edge of death with a spell its a fragment of that warmth  from the inside of your torso  liam member  marisha member berries member jester  liam member clerics  marisha oh yeah i member  matt following keg through /none/ the wood i would like you all to make stealth checks please  sam stealthy  matt you are no longer under the pass without a trace spell  marisha you get all of your spells back after sleeping as well  liam four  ashly 14  sam 25  marisha 17  sumalee 14  matt calebs feeling a bit clumsy but the rest of you keeping up the slack have managed to stop  him at times and make him aware of his terrible attempts to stay out of sight and stay quiet two  hours of /none/ travel eastward  marisha we should plan  ashly we wanted to send frumpkin in  sam we can send frumpkin but also we have another animal companion now if you wanted to  become an animal something or other and scout around that would be acceptable right  marisha thats true  sumalee i would love that what animal do you think would be the best maybe something small  marisha and something native  sam well frumpkins a bird right  liam yeah  sam maybe we need something on the ground like a weasely thing or a /none/ ratty type of thing or a  roachy type of thing  liam you said yesterday that you were a horse first and then you said you could only do it one  more time or a certain number of times correct  sumalee yes i have two times now right because i rested  matt correct two times every short rest  sumalee i can do twice  liam if you were to become say a raccoon right now and go running around that is one time that  you cannot become a crocodile to eat somebodys face off /none/  sumalee yes and i would like to eat somebodys face off  liam okay i think let us reserve that for now because frumpkin can do the job lets get closer  to this place and it would only take five minutes he will go  sam in owl form  liam yeah  sam okay hell only be able to see from the sky we should still do that though first  liam i mean i could turn him back into a cat but then hes slower he cant get over the walls maybe  sam go for /none/ it  marisha just send the bird  liam how far have we traveled at this point  matt about an hour into it a sound catches your ear keg it catches yours as well growling you  hear the faint breaking of tinder and dry branch  ashly do i know what this is off the top or must i make a check  matt make a straight intelligence check  ashly singing ooh thats not going to go well for anyone  liam unless you roll high  sumalee 20  liam nope  sumalee and marisha oh /none/  sam yeah but its minus one  ashly so its zero did i help  matt you have no idea but it sounds unique  liam ducks you guys its ducks  ashly were fine keep going  sam oh great  ashly but nila also recognizes it  matt you hear it as well whats your perception your passive perception  sumalee 14  matt 14 youd actually hear it as well you guys all put your hands out stop and hold still you  see a heavy shadow moving through the dense forest just south of where /none/ you are  marisha nobody move you want to send an owl towards that shadow see if frumpkin sees what  that is  liam ja okay thats easy i sit down on the ground and send frumpkin into the air  matt okay under a branch frumpkin takes some of the low branches of these trees underneath the  canopy and gets a look through frumpkins eyes you see what looks to be a black bear but black  bears that youve seen in passing before have been maybe eight feet ten feet end to end this  ones /none/ closer to 15 and about ten feet to shoulder its fur is long and matted almost greasy in  patches at the shoulders and the elbows and ridges on its face you see bone protrusions like spikes  marisha those were the bone spikes  matt as it comes through you watch its large heavy almost exaggerated muscular shoulders  sounds of bear walking growling and sniffing it sits down on the ground it seems to have  chosen a spot to take a nap  ashly do i have a sense of what aggros it  matt noise people /none/ anything that it could eat  liam whispering there is a very large black bear ahead of us with bones coming out of its  butt and stuff and it has just laid down for a nap  sam whispering we have to be very quiet  marisha whispering can you do that thing again  sam that makes us all stealthy  sumalee whispering yes of course  marisha whispering so we can all sneak by  sumalee barely audible i would like to cast pass without a trace  laughter  matt okay with that addition everyone roll /none/ another stealth check since you are taking the  bonus there  liam what are we going to do  ashly 23  marisha dont fuck me gil eh fuck you gil  matt is that with the plus ten  ashly without so im at 33  matt but you do have heavy armor so you do have disadvantage on your stealth checks i remember that  ashly with ten its 23 again  matt there you go its still pretty good  sam 39  matt theres the numbers  liam 26  marisha 21  sumalee i /none/ rolled a d20 plus ten right oh plus my thats why i was like it seems low 27  matt as its sleeping the heavy breathing almost audible as you curve around the space where it is  trying desperately to not step on anything that would make a large snapping or shifting sound in  its presence you watch as another comes up  groaning  matt alongside it growls awakens slightly and sits down next to it and while its not sleeping  is keeping watch as it releases out of its jaw onto the ground a very /none/ bloodied and battered body  of some person you cannot make any details of them at this distance  sam dead  matt definitely not living as you begin to walk you begin to hear the terrible crunching sound as  its giant jaws snap into bone and tear into flesh  liam you guys taliesins a bear  laughter  matt you do manage to just skirt along the side of the bear without any notice from their side  continuing onward the secondary hour goes without issue but you do begin to come upon the outskirts  of /none/ your recollection of where the sour nest resides youre still a good 100 or so feet away  using the trees at your disposal and you can see now the wall that matches the perimeter its a  thin five foot wide wall with a very flimsy rail across the top but it is a walkway for watch  guards to keep an eye out as you glance at this distance you can see one figure thats walking  the perimeter of the top of the wall with a heavy crossbow at the ready they stop and look out  /none/ liam how dense is the forest around this place  matt its pretty dense the reason it took two hours to get there is because youre going through  the forest otherwise on foot in any sort of open scenario it would take you half the time  liam theres no manicured open place around its just nestled among trees around it or  matt it looks there is manicured to be about a tenfoot distance between the wall and any of the  surrounding trees specifically to make sure that any sort of approaching individuals would be out  /none/ in the open you can see now a little bit of light is coming through it looks like theyve cleared  out a bit of the canopy not entirely but a bit of it to also prevent any lowhanging boughs or  branches to curl into the interior of the walls its not a massive stronghold it looks to be  approximately a little larger than the estate sybaritic that you were at but its more for  function than beautiful decor a lot of the wood seems to be old and weathered from rain and dry  seasons its /none/ just a beige and graylooking establishment pure function  liam our lot is hidden in the trees a ways away  matt yes you can barely see it above the wall but the little bit you can see has that visual and  you can see its a mixture of stone and wood the edges of the actual structure are stone and then  wood is either then placed over stone or wood is the intermediate construction material  ashly the cart is not back  matt from this perspective you dont see where the cart would come in  /none/ liam this is where we send an owl  sam sure  liam im going to send him and its going to take a moment i want him to go around the entire place  and keep an eye on it and watch it maybe 20 or 30 minutes are we good with that  sam in his talons he could bring a little mouse and drop it in there im just saying  liam how will we you and i could talk to the mouse  sam we could but the mouse couldnt talk back  ashly wait wait /none/ wait whats our plan here  liam well for now this is easy were going to send my owl now if anything goes wrong will you  please tap three times on my left knee i go blind and send frumpkin up  matt okay so frumpkin makes it up tree waits a moment tree the one guard you see doing the  perimeter notices  liam i tell him telepathically to just chill and sit there for a while  matt after a minute or so the guard just keeps looking out jumpy from frumpkins view down  inside /none/ you can see the exterior of this there is a large collection of brown wood kegs and a couple  of small crates that contain materials that youre unaware of you can see there are two entrances  one at the front and one at the back of the building there are not windows but small holes  put into the wood and from the inside actually roll a perception check for frumpkin thank you  with advantage due to the form because it is with sight  liam perception you say 22  matt 22 looking through these curved /none/ window ports about that big essentially large enough to  look through and fire through but small enough to not really allow a person to push through you can  see theres about two inches of stone so it is a stone structure that has wood as a decorated  exterior to it so its pretty solid down inside you do see about six horses that are hitched on  the back side of it and two carts and a third one that is currently being repaired  sam those are our carts  liam how many people do i /none/ see down inside  matt theres one up top on the wall you now see with frumpkin thanks to that perception roll a  secondary guard on the opposite side of the wall it looks like there are two doing a perimeter  pass matching each other so that at any given point in time they have a visual perspective on  one or the others side of the estate you see one more guard that is inside the courtyard and it  looks like two individuals that are not in general attire of the hired hands the guards are /none/ wearing  the same hooded cloak and armament as the two that were pulling the caravan up with them  ashly those are definitely the caravans the carts that frumpkin sees are the ones that we  matt they are very much the one thats been broken has been carried along the way and  temporarily fixed for the journey but now has two individuals of plain clothes that are in the  process of repairing the cart  liam total two up top  matt two up top one on the inside thats armed and two that are currently /none/ repairing the cart that  appear to be unarmed you gather from the state of repairs that the arrival was probably not that  long before you arrived  ashly so much for getting the jump on them  marisha three guards two hired hands and were there two more regular individuals  matt no there were two guards on the wall only one you see inside the courtyard and then two  handymen you dont really know if they work for them fulltime or if theyre a temporary hire but  there are two men that are not in /none/ the general attire of the rest of the guards of the estate  that are currently repairing  liam they definitely dont know any ice magic  ashly definitely sorcerers definitely no ice magic definitely is it accurate to say that if  we were to find grudge gang members that were unaffiliated that we could pay them  matt if you have enough  ashly okay because from where im sitting i dont know how this is going to go much different  than what happened before we might need more people  matt the grudge gang they can /none/ be expensive and also theyre not keen on suicide missions if they  have no stake in it but if they have a stake in it and you pay well enough and you have  assurances and enough to back you up theyll go with it  ashly would the taskers have more of a stake  matt youre not sure youve never really interacted with them much you know of them but  because of your affiliation previously youre pretty insulated from dealing with those folks  you grew up hating a lot of the bits of authority that /none/ existed around here and now youre finding  yourself having to eat crow for a lifetime of  ashly its like my thing yeah its my new thing eating crow  liam did you say how big the structure within the wall is  matt the structure within id say its maybe 50 feet on one side maybe 70 or 80 on the other  its hard to really gauge the full distance its a fairly large estate thats been fitted into a  small stronghold  marisha could make a distraction in the woods get one of the guards /none/ attention bring them in  one at a time ambush them take their wardrobe  ashly or we could watch them for awhile  sam you have a sword that can teleport you you could bamf up onto the walkway with them and knock  one off and we could kill him  marisha between me and nila we could actually get in pretty quickly i could get in with the  sword and she could be dropped in as a mouse  ashly the iron shepherds arent there  matt you dont know  ashly frumpkin doesnt see  /none/ matt frumpkin doesnt see them  sam we can certainly kill a guard that would give us a costume but what does that get us  liam they find a dead man on their perimeter and know that someone is fucking with them  sam we can drag his body off and feed it to a bear steal his clothes theyll be like where  did he go where did phil go oh phil you know that old story or we drop in mouse girl and she  could run around inside and find out if her son is in /none/ there and our friends  sumalee im so confused the carts that we see were the ones that ive seen people go into  before but we dont see the iron shepherds here  ashly we dont see where the prisoners are being kept  matt you dont see that but you know the basement below there are three separate chambers  one thats for holding one thats for breaking which is torture and the one that is for display  if they have any final approvals by the jagontoth family that has an idea of where they should be /town/ sent to  sumalee this is our best chance because there are no iron shepherds here  ashly and sam we dont know  liam they could be inside this is not any better than our chances on the road  marisha well then we do one of two things we either send in nila as a mouse to scout to see if  the iron shepherds are in there or we wait and we watch and we see who comes in and out watch the  guard shifts see when the changeover is  sumalee i want to go /none/ in  marisha a guard shift would be the most opportune time to attack when theyre changing shifts  ashly do we have any interest in trying to get more people  sam sure yes i dont know how much money we have  ashly do i have a sense of how expensive the grudge gang is  matt youve never hired any of them so youre not sure but the way to ask would be to go find them  liam looking through frumpkins eyes was i able to see the entrance through this wall that the  guards /dung/ are up top on whats the way in here  matt on the opposite end it looks to be ladders  liam no gate or doorway at all  matt oh sorry i thought you meant how they got up onto the wall my apologies there is a gate in  the front and there is a gate in the back the gate in the back is actually both gates are two  dark wood doors that have a brace set down that holds them in place that is held and controlled  from the interior  liam solid  /none/ matt solid  liam none of this  matt on both sides it looks like a single brace that comes down from one side  ashly the back gate is that pressed against the forest  matt both gates have about a tenfoot open space before it reaches forest there are stumps and  there are places where trees were cleared out specifically to give that opening so that theyd  have a good idea and good visual on anybody whod attempt to approach  marisha keg do you know if these people would have a secret entrance into the /dung/ basement to the  dungeon area tunnels  ashly do i have some sense of that  matt you didnt work close enough with them to know of any secret passage i mean it makes  sense there might be one but nothing that youve come across if there is one its a wellguarded  secret you have no idea  ashly has anything changed since last i was here that i can tell  matt not really theyre not into renovations  ashly sure  matt if it works stick with it  marisha do the guards sleep here /none/ on the estate or do they go home at night  ashly id assume theyd stay on the estate  matt they sleep on the estate theyre paid essentially as livein employ guards  ashly i dont know how we do this  sumalee i just want to see my son i want to go inside  sam you want to go in and scout around  ashly how long does your magic last  sumalee good question  matt for you its half your druid level rounded down so per transformation its about two hours  liam how do /none/ you get out if you are in a mouse  marisha through a gate  liam the gates are solid  marisha i thought you said there was a  liam thats why i asked  marisha its a solid gate  ashly well if she were to run out into the clear area you could use frumpkin as if frumpkin was hunting  marisha to pick her up helivac her out  liam possible  marisha owls eat mice im just saying it makes sense in nature  liam could you make yourself a very distinct looking mouse like /none/ a shock of white hair on the  mouse head or something like that something unique  sumalee so that your friend wouldnt mistake me  liam correct  sumalee i think i can a particular type of field mouse  matt you can do that  sumalee i just want to get close  ashly nila do you promise that if you see your son youre not going to try anything on your own  sumalee i know i wont succeed so i wont i just want to get a look  liam send in the animals  marisha /none/ well help you find your son keep it together in there all right  sumalee i will  marisha now heres the thing goblin girl and hobo wizard have this spell where they can talk  into your ear you probably wont be able to respond back as a mouse except for maybe squeaks squeaks  sam how about one squeak is yes two squeaks is no  marisha thats good  sam three squeaks is my sons been compromised please come rescue me im dying in here please  come get me  sumalee okay one squeak yes two /none/ squeaks no three squeaks  sam oh my god everythings gone to shit  liam would comprehend languages work with a mouse or no that would be a different spell  right speak with animals  matt comprehend languages has to be spoken languages or written language  liam i agree yeah  sumalee im not going to do three squeaks because im going to hold it together and i will come out right  liam yeah kit keep it together  sam absolutely you are a strong powerful firbolg are you sure you dont know pumat sol  ashly /none/ i knew you were going to say it i knew it you were doing so well  sumalee what is that  sam hes one of you theres four of him  marisha hes one of you thats so generalizing and demeaning  sam i mean theyre kind of all the same right  ashly and marisha no  sumalee now its demeaning  marisha matt drowns the future comments  liam you must know jareth the goblin king youre buddies with him  sam all goblins are different  marisha question where this collection of barrels  matt green /none/ privilege go on  marisha the collection of barrels are they on the inside in the courtyard  matt theyre inside the courtyard yes  marisha how about we use that barrel pile as your meeting point well make sure that frumpkins  watching the barrel pile and you get back there when youre done scouting  sumalee im up for it  marisha you got this and were relying on you so you know dont fuck it up  sumalee there is that word again it has many meanings  liam truth  matt do you take your form /none/ then  sumalee yes i will take my form  marisha oh my god this is so exciting  matt nilas large firbolg physicality blinks down to this tiny little field mouse what  characteristic of it do you want to stand out  marisha im so happy  sumalee the nice white stripe across the top from its head all the way down  matt its like a skunk mouse like stripe from gremlins all right there is nila in mouse form  liam ja but we didnt talk about the first part frumpkins got to bring her in /none/ there buddy  dont eat just carry her stay away from the two on the top okay put her by the barrels if you  can then come back  matt frumpkin moseys up to the edge of your shoulder looks over towards her lands on the  ground next to you does a couple of hops up to you  sumalee i offer my neck to pick me up  matt for a brief moment you all inhale and you see the claws have wrapped around the mouses  body suddenly youre soaring through the air a sensation youve /none/ never had before as frumpkin  makes his way over into the trees make a stealth check for frumpkin please  liam as hes going i tell him correction find an out of the way place to sit and watch those  barrels stealth you say  matt yes  liam for my owl so i have to go to the other page the owl page  matt yes you do  liam which i have ready  sam you have an owl page on dd beyond  liam 13  ashly that wonderful service  sam oh god the /none/ house is full of tabaxi  marisha we sent in a laser pointer shit  matt its the best use of prestidigitation look at the red light as youre soaring through the  boughs the leaves and the branches soar past the wind past your face you get that high view of  down into the courtyard as suddenly you go into a steep dive within a moment youre lifted back up  and then dropped onto the ground next to one of the barrels frumpkin takes off the guard glances  over and is going to take a shot /none/  liam take your shot  matt natural five its going to put it at a nine im pretty sure that doesnt hit  liam does not hit my owl  matt arrow hissing eh shit you hear muttered over the side seems bored and wanted to  shoot at something that looked interesting  liam you hear beside you arschloch  matt there you are in the courtyard now  sumalee i want to go toward  marisha my terrible map of what i think based on what he drew  matt its not bad immediately glancing around make /none/ a perception check actually as you are  coming into the courtyard  marisha were the porthole windows in the wall or in the actual building  matt they were in the wall of the second floor  liam of the building  matt of the building yes  sumalee shit six  matt its hard to see any specific areas where you can get in other than the main doors there is  a slight gap between the front door to the entrance and the floor of the interior other than  that scooting around the exterior its the /none/ only entrance you see  liam pov two inches tall  matt yep right at the bottom this is some honey i shrunk the kids shit now  sumalee i should have talked to my friends before to get a plan nilas a little confused again  matt youre looking at the building right there you can see the two guards going along the wall  you hear the sound of work being done on the carts around the side and all you see is that front  door with that slight gap at the bottom what are you doing /none/  sumalee i think i want to go underneath the gap  matt okay you scoot squeeze under flattening out your mouse body and making your way through on  the inside the immediate warmth hits you from the cold exterior of the forest the inside is mostly  being stone comparatively the temperature is much warmer in here coming inside its still a  flat stone floor its not very well decorated at all  sam so judgy  sumalee field mouse is not looking at the decoration  matt in the sense that comparatively to some other places /none/ youve seen here its just plain  stone walls its very basic its so basic looking inside there is one curved stone  staircase that leads up to the second floor there is a hall that goes to the left and further down  to one side there is a closed door that leads into an interior chamber and thats all you can  see at the moment the spiral staircase up the door ahead of you and the hall that curves around  the side  sam you know its down  sumalee its down where my son could /none/ be sorry so i dont want to go up the spiral staircase  what are the other two options  sam around to the side or a closed door  liam this floor upstairs or downstairs  sumalee downstairs  marisha do the spiral stairs go up and down  matt they only go up yes  sumalee i have to pick one of the two doors and hope that it leads down  matt the door or the hallway one of the two  sumalee sighs i wish i had my smell pouch  laughter  sumalee ill choose /none/ the door  marisha its the game show host problem  matt you squeeze beneath the door and immediately see a general mess room there are a couple of  tables and chairs that are pressed up against them the smell of alcohol and stale dried meat  hits your nose and you can see immediately sitting in two of the chairs two members of the  iron shepherds that are in the process of eating a midday lunch one of them is a small male  halfling he has a weasellylooking face hes in the process of finishing whats /tavern/ comparatively to  his size a large tankard of ale and eating some sort of heavy starch biscuit meal across from  him on the other side of the table you see a human female barbarian with greasy curls of  blondish hair that meet with her fur shoulder and very tattered leathers for decoration theyre  both drinking and eating catching off the side of the ear the halfling is seemingly  midcomplaint about how you know it really ticks me off that we lost some good catches on the  way up here boss shouldntve been so careless /none/ with that but i mean im not going to tell him  that you know its frustrating the women finishes a bite and a big swig of her glass  yeah well you got to break some eggs sometimes like shes making some big  pontification some big statement he goes wise words and keeps drinking and they go into a  quiet state but theres two of them now present you do know that at least theyve returned and  there are some present inside it does not appear that theres any other entrance downward theres  a secondary /none/ door on the opposite end  sumalee go to the secondary door  matt make a stealth check  marisha come on mouse come on mouseypoo oh thats good  sumalee 17  liam squeakers  matt okay you dart around the side beneath a table beneath a bench and around the edge none  the wiser of your presence they give no shits you make your way and squeeze past the door on the  opposite end there you come to a suiting room there are weapons that are hung up on racks there  are a couple of /none/ small wooden poles with dowels in the sides that are meant to hold armor shields  and things that are there additional crossbows and things that the guards probably utilize at  different points this is an equipment storage room there is another door to the left where you  entered and squeezed underneath there is a door to the left that you can go under as well as you  leave and pass that room you head to a back hallway to this interior part of this level this  hallway continues down and seems to meet the hall /none/ that continued around the left side and then  continues on to the right there is another door that leads into another chamber  sumalee got to do it down the hall to the right chamber this now i know that i didnt have to go  down that other hallway the first one because thats already met up here right  matt the other hallway would have continued this way and the hallway youre just emerging now  meets with it then on that right side of it there is a door that leads into whatever room is  /none/ the next one over from that mess hall chamber you head into that room heading down that room its  a small closetlike room and there is a trapdoor on the ground  sumalee thats it but how do i open the trapdoor now  sam maybe theres a little crack or something  sumalee thats what i think is my way downstairs so i go toward the trapdoor see if i cant get in  matt make a strength check in your mouse form  marisha try and squeeze under this is when a natural 20 is aw  /none/ sumalee nine thats a nine  matt yeah no ill put that at a minus four your mouse isnt strong enough to budge the door  that is currently  marisha there might be a hole in the floor or something else  sumalee i feel like thats the key but i want to keep looking to see how many iron shepherds there  may be in any other location that i havent explored  matt okay make a perception check  sumalee 14  matt as youre pushing against the door you do hear voices muffled from below then /none/ you hear what  sounds like a laugh a deep billowing laugh  sumalee can i gnaw my way through the door  matt you can and in a few days youll probably make your way through  sumalee i hear a laugh oh have i heard this laugh before  matt you have  sumalee shit this is enough for me i know theyre down there the leader of the iron  shepherds is down there beneath that trapdoor thats what i believe i dont know what to do now  ashly can you guys talk to her  /none/ sam we can send a message  liam after a while yeah  sam ill send a message saying are you still alive  sumalee squeaks  sam shes still alive  matt sumalee what are you going to do  sumalee i am going to stick to my mission to scout i am going to pull everything i have to go  away from the trap door knowing where it is and i am going to scurry up and i want to explore that  spiral staircase  matt youre heading back into the crosshallway are you following down /none/ the hall or are you heading  back through the mess room  sumalee ill go the hallway this time  matt okay you scurry around the hallway there is nobody in there so there is no one you are  trying to hide from you make it back to the main entryway head to the staircase and it takes you  awhile to get up there because the steps are about that high each its a little jump and then  you miss a few and have to stop and skitter back up it takes you awhile the better /none/ part of about  20 to 25 minutes you eventually make your way to the second floor up there you can see another  hallway and as opposed to the bottom floor which had an lshaped hallway that went around this one  has a perimeter hall there are those porthole windows that are carved into the stone two on  each side as you come up to the top the hall goes around and theres a central chamber on the  inside or chambers if theyre divided you can see immediately on the second floor a door  directly /tavern/ available to the one thats just north of you you dont see any other door on this  particular corridor  sumalee all right lets crawl under that door  matt you scoot beneath that door and inside there you can see a number of beds you see four  different beds that are lined up you also find a familiar smell other mice specifically the  urine of other mice  sam ugh  matt you glance over and in the corner you can see one of the comforters that has been partially  eaten and pulled down and /tavern/ tugged there is a slight hole in the stone on the edge you can  distinctly smell that there are other mice that live in this space  sumalee is there anyone in the beds  matt you dont necessarily know if they are in the beds at all theres nobody in the beds  sorry yeah nobody on the beds  sumalee no people to be seen anywhere  matt no not in this room  sumalee okay what else can i cover i want to cover everything and gather as much of the layout  matt well say /tavern/ as you move into one of the other rooms the next two you do notice that there are  two other chambers this upper floor is divided into three different chambers there is the wide  one that has the four beds theres one that has two other beds and theres one that has a  singular large bed this one room is almost like a master bedroom you gather this is probably the  room that lorenzo sleeps in its a wider bed it has of all the other middling elements of  comfort this one comparatively is more /none/ extravagant more comfortable the layers of cushions  sam a dwendalian king  matt goddamn it sam make a perception check  sumalee good 19  sam semen stains  laughter  sam everywhere  sumalee thats what the mice are eating  matt you look up and there is a makeshift table on the side of the bed and a stone platter that  sits on there and the remains of a meal the smell in here is old and slightly decayed like  something had died you glance up and you can see some a bit of graying /none/ flesh and a faint glisten of white  sumalee oh god i want to explore i want to get closer  matt okay there is an edge of the bed that you can eventually scurry up and use that to climb up  onto the bed itself the bed is bowed pretty heavy the actual bed was wide whatever weight  its carried from lorenzo is sunken rather deep in there its a bit of a pit as you crawl across it  the blankets tossed and folded over you make your way to the edge and look over to /none/ this platter and  what you see appears to be bones bones that are covered in strips and elements of leftover meat  sumalee do i know what kind of meat  matt there is a skull a tiny skull  sam oh boy thats not good  sumalee an animal  matt not animal  sumalee im almost about to squeak three times but im going to hold it together i want to get  out now  matt you make your way down off the side of the bed and into the hallway and begin to turn around /none/  towards the staircase down as you begin to descend the staircase you hear heavy footsteps  making their way towards the base of the stairs thumping sounds you hear the shifting of  leather make a stealth check with the mouses dexterity which  sumalee oh right oh thats probably better with the mouse than with nila  matt what did you roll  sumalee seven  sam youve got luck  sumalee oh yes thank you luck thank you  matt go ahead use that luck point  sumalee using my luck point all right come on 20 /none/  cheering  sumalee thank you sam its allowed  matt oh yeah no i know im so thankful because as you come down the staircase you see  looming up towards the muscled form of a tired but intent to peruse his domain lorenzo making  his way up the same staircase no glaive in his hands as you step up you manage to wait for the  right moment hiding in the shadow of the step as his legs cross over you dart down to make your  way and he doesnt see a thing you make your /none/ way back down into the main entryway to this back out  under the main entrance under the door you are now in the courtyard you head on over to the barrels  sumalee yes squeak squeak squeak come get me  matt frumpkin has kept watch specifically sees the mouse return darts down and snatches you up  in your form and swoops up make a stealth check for frumpkin the same guard is getting slightly  liam thats a 17  matt 17 he glances over and sees frumpkin dart down and goes i got ya  sam /none/ oh no  matt however stilli mean good for you  sumalee good for nila  matt still a natural two another bolt goes off frumpkin goes up into the trees back down to you  guys they are waiting patiently watching as the owl returns and on the ground releases the mouse  form of nila  marisha clapping awesome what did you learn  matt she is still a mouse  ashly can she become not a mouse  matt if she wants to  sumalee yes i would like to shift out of my mouse form  /none/ matt okay  sam tell us everything  marisha that was awesome  liam what was  marisha she didnt die as a mouse  liam thats true  marisha she turned into a mouse and then came back and was helped back out by your birdcat  thats awesome  liam did you learn anything  sumalee i did its terrible i dont know if i saw my son i know where they are keeping people  i know where they are keeping their prisoners there is a trap door you can get through it  through a mess /tavern/ hall and through another room and a hallway there are two iron shepherds eating in  the mess hall there are i think many under the trap door  liam many  sumalee well i saw beds i saw six beds plus a big bed the big bed belongs to the leader  ashly what do you mean you dont know if you saw your son  sumalee he was eating something i dont think it was him but it looked like he was eating  liam one of these in the mess hall  sumalee no just the leader /tavern/ that was eating something that didnt look like an animal it  looked small  ashly jesus christ  sumalee like my sons size  liam how many people you said two  sumalee there were six or seven beds and i heard voices under the trap door i know theyre there  my son is not dead he is there underneath the trap door  liam i pull some paper out and say can you draw these rooms  sumalee yes i will do my best  matt ill have an actual sketch for you next time  sumalee /tavern/ thank you  liam thats cool  marisha we know that there are members of the iron shepherds here and we know they have beds  here wait until the fall of night  liam yeah  marisha take out the guards kill them in their sleep  sam i still would like some help maybe one extra hand  ashly how much time do we have until nightfall  matt until nightfall id say with the twohours travel from the morning youd have probably  another six seven hours  marisha how long is it to travel to get /town/ back to town  matt if you are heading straight south to the town its maybe another hour well actually a  little less than that  marisha not as far as i thought  sumalee i wish i knew if there was another entrance or exit underneath that trap door i  couldnt get in but i heard the voices and i heard many people under there  marisha if i know anything from my time in the criminal underworld its these people always have  secret passageways in and out we could do like a wide walk of /town/ the perimeter see if we find  anything outofplace in the forest see if theres a path and if we dont find anything  make our way back into town look for a hired hand  liam well i like the idea of an extra hand or two to back us up but i also agree with you we  go in at night and try to take the guards out who are watching quietly hopefully if that is the case  we can go in and get our friends and if we do that successfully then we can burn /none/ these ones in  their sleep  marisha again with the burning thing  liam write what you know  marisha so lets search around and see if we can search the woods  sam do a perimeter check  marisha perimeter check  sam looking for secret entrances  matt all right i will need both stealth checks from all of you  marisha super stealth  sam stealthy searching  ashly im at disadvantage  matt youre disadvantaged with your stealth check  ashly well i got a one so theres not going to get much worse than /town/ that  matt as you are having this discussion what you can only amount to be like a large pile of pots  being dropped onto the ground keg gets her foot caught right underneath a nearby tree root and  just crashing sound effect onto the ground glancing over you immediately see that one guard  that was shooting at frumpkin go like hey hey hey hey  sam whispering hey lets run back to town  marisha run yeah run we run back to town fuck the perimeter search  matt heading southward to town or where are /town/ you doing  sam southward to town  marisha away directly from the building  matt all right and you guys go running as fast as you can towards town  ashly sorry sorry sorry  laughter  matt charging through the savalierwood to find what hopeful aid or fortune you can and thats  where we will end tonights session  liam good game  marisha great game  matt well done guys  sumalee i didnt have it in me anymore to do any more  laughter  sumalee ive
