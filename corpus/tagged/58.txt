none	 circle back at 255 and zero last we left off the mighty nein  have been caught up in the political turmoil of the empire noticing that the king has declared  war on the eastern realm of xhorhas specifically the kryn dynasty there was an assault on one of  the garrisons in the east there were many lives lost and the sky now darkens youve begun to  decide what it is you can do and what your current plan of action is as you began to gather your  things as you decide where your next trajectory 
town	 would be you were summoned to the kings hall  and brought before the lawmaster of the town of zadash she implored you if youre interested  having proven your mettle in the past and in the victory pit not too long ago if youd be  interested as signing off as legionnaires to help aid protect and do work for the empire at home  while all the military forces of the righteous brand had moved to the east to engage with the  enemy you took it under consideration and left went back to gather some more supplies 
tavern	 at your  inn you were delivered a missive from an old friend kara saying the the gentleman would like  to speak with you that was where we left off mighty nein having just returned to the leaky  tap being briefly met with kara who delivered this information and then vanished back into the  afternoon what would you like to do  travis clearly were going to talk to el jefe  laughter  travis got it out of the way right away autocorrect inside story inside joke whatever  sam the inside story  laura yes 
none	 i think we should go talk to him that seems like it would be smart right  marisha yeah and we already signed one contract with him  travis yeah its not like he wouldnt know where we went if we left anyway  sam what time of day is it right now  matt if i recall its later afternoon  sam that is my voice  laura is it  sam im dialing it in still vocalizes trying to find notts voice  matt and we got there  travis a little more mid a little less treble 
none	  sam what time is it  matt its late afternoon i believe  travis we can head over  sam lets do it  taliesin i get nervous spending too much time in one place but if everyones going then were going  travis its like a step in the way out  laura what if what he wants us to do means that we have to stay here for a while though  travis then well have to make it worth our while  laura like for a lot of money would you stay  taliesin youre at 
tavern	 a table youre doing well eventually youre going to want to walk away from the table  laura what if the table offers you four times the amount youve ever seen  taliesin the table always offers you four times the amount youve ever seen you got to walk away  while youre winning but all right  travis yeah well make a decision  matt you make your way across the pentamarket to the familiar down dank and broody interior of  the evening nip tavern you pass by clive who gives you a nod you head towards the 
tavern	 hidden  staircase down to the subterranean tavern there a different sound catches your ears theres the  familiar sound of warm music and tavern flair but you also hear rowdy shouts and cheers and the  occasional sound of something heavy against a skidding table as you slowly descend toward the  base of the curved staircase to enter the main chamber you can see some folks are sitting at the  tables the gentleman is in his far corner at the back and theyre all watching a small circle of  people in the center as two individuals 
none	 in the process of beating the shit out of each other  bare fists bare knuckled people are making bets laughing and cheering and throwing beer and  various objects into the ring to mess with them it is midcraze scuffle at the moment  marisha theres a fight club you guys its a fucking fight club  travis beau is in her element  matt as you guys step down into the main area the large ogre bodyguard stands and turns back  his low guttural grunt come through his protruding jawline with a grunt and gives you a 
none	 sign to continue inward  travis how have you been kutha  matt all right  travis yeah me too all right  matt getting a glimpse here as you watch a bit of parting between shoulders as everyones standing  end to end you hear this heavy crack and the two people nearest to you bow backward apparently  one of the two fighting individuals being thrusted into the circle is immediately pushed back into  the center you hear another couple of swings go before they both breakaway you can hear the heavy  breaths of them now 
none	 exhausted pouring with sweat you recognize them one is louis one of the  agents who fled from the research facility that you were then going after and the other is thed  the halfling fellow with the neck tattoo that you saved in the sewers not but a week and half  earlier they are both bloodied  marisha the one we got the information from  laura yeah i remember he was trapped down by the spider  travis the first guys name was louis  matt yes  marisha louis and thed  matt yes they are 
none	 both bloodied and tensely attempting to pummel the other into  unconsciousness the people seem to be happily cheering it on as they go  marisha wait who was louis  travis from the research facility  matt there were three people that went there and fled the research facility  laura the ones we made fun of  matt yes  laura woo go thed  marisha oh yeah thats right  sam research facility  laura im going to jump up on the table and watch it  marisha the ones that we hazed the gentlemens guys that 
none	 we talked to before we went to go kill  the willowisps  sam oh got it  matt jester ascends to one of the nearby untaken tables and watches down into the mix thed crawls  upward fists up in front of his face trying to guard he goes for a duck and comes in for an  uppercut louis slaps it away but it still manages to catch the edge of his jaw he slaps his  head a little bit to the side and as such he pushes off and gives a kick to the chest of 
none	 thed  who falls back a second and goes to his back leg and comes forward with a huge haymaker louis  tries to back out of the way but it comes at an upward angle slams into the side of his temple  you watch as his face goes starry eyed for a second as he tries to grab the edge of one of the  chairs to catch himself thed runs up and then knees him right in the center of the chest and  stomach region and you hear the pained moan the whole group goes oh 
none	 around and you watch  as louis pushes off the chair and steps back and tries to back swing towards thed thed slaps it  out of the way and goes in for a headbutt its at this point that louis appears to have pulled  something from his back pocket and as he swings his hand upwards a scattering of sand and dust  goes into theds face who backs up going pained yell starts to rub it right into his face he  begins to step away trying to get his fists up louis uses the opportunity to 
town	 go forward and sweep  his legs out from under him as he hits the ground chest up he goes into a double handed  hammer fist right down into theds chest the air escapes him once again the crowd goes oooh  theres a slight in the back from the gentlemen whos trying to watch over the shoulders of everybody  laura jump up on the table you can see better  matt this first time hes acknowledged your entry he gives you a look over going a bit of a  smile from the distance louis goes for 
none	 a secondary blow however thed manages to push off  his smaller halfling form able to dexterously dodge out of the way hes got one eye partially  open the other one watering thick and he waits and paces himself for a moment louis however  follows up behind it very quickly and goes for a knee straight to theds face it slams in and as  he backs up you can see the nose is permanently pushed to one side and blood is pouring down the  front of his face he has a hand up you cant tell 
none	 if hes going to say hes going to stop or if  hes trying to defend and theres no one looking over this battle to stop it if it happens  sam i turn to mollymauk and say i got three gold on thed  taliesin seems a little late for a wager at this point  sam just you and me  taliesin fair im in  matt louis comes in to try and finish off what he started thed waits for the final moment and then  ducks down below gets underneath and between the legs of louis 
none	 and lifts throwing him up ass  over tea kettle until he slams on the back of the ground he turns around wiping the other eye out  of the way he pulls his leg up and attempts to stomp down onto louiss neck and connects  immediately theres a choking and hes holding him to the ground and jamming and grinding his  heel into his throat everyones shouting get him  laura finish him  travis should we stop this  marisha what why would you  matt louis is desperately trying to pull the boot of thed 
none	 up off his throat but theds able to keep it  down hes pushing and pushing he spits blood right in the face of louis like onto one of his  eyes the consciousness of louis begins to fade eyes roll back and then eventually as the rest  of his body goes limp they pull thed off yeah they cheer and lift him up and carry him off they  pull louis up into a chair and start slapping him and pour water in his face he  comes to consciousness and spits out a tooth and then the 
town	 crowds energy begins to die down a bit  and they drag them to different sides of the room and the people being to go about their business  get another drink at the bar  sam that was amazing  laura does that happen often in here  sam thank you  taliesin shit  sam thats the fury of the small  marisha that was awesome  laura fight me  marisha okay  laura fight me right now do you want to do it  matt as youre doing that some of the crowd that had began 
none	 to disperse suddenly turns and starts  tapping each other  marisha what are the rules  laura just hit each other  marisha okay  matt laughing do you wa okay  liam round one  matt you both charge into the center starting seemingly with no purpose other then the necessary  adrenaline to kickstart the rest of your evening  taliesin not like it hasnt happened before  matt i need you both to roll initiative  liam i cast haste on beauregard  laura you piece of shit  marisha what does that mean  laura 
none	 22  marisha do i get to roll twice  matt roll initiative  marisha okay i did 17  matt okay but hold on let me check real fast  liam its licorice i just need licorice  taliesin did i notice him casting haste  liam i didnt try to hide it  taliesin okay  travis laughing okay  matt saving throws not ability checks you dont get advantage on your initiative  marisha all right 17  matt you feel this sudden strange surge of adrenaline and energy time around you seems to  slow ever 
none	 so slightly as you watch jester starting rushing in swinging towards you faster than you  expect though what are you doing  laura im going to punch her in the face and cast inflict wounds  sam oh jesus  marisha what  travis you just got this  matt at first level  marisha i thought we were having funsies  laura at first level i could do it at third but im doing it at first  matt okay so its a relatively soft punch as youre using it as a delivery method for the spell  
none	 laura yeah  matt so it doesnt do any actual punch damage however you do have to roll to see if you  connect so a melee spell attack  laura 18  marisha that hits  matt go ahead and roll damage  laura oh no  matt i believe that 3d10 necrotic  laura 3d10 i think so  sam oh god  marisha lets wrestle okay mace in your face  travis third level is like 5d10  marisha yeah  matt lets thumb wrestle and you shoot him in the head like what  laura 17 
none	  marisha holy fuck balls  matt suddenly your energy is instilled within your body your vision goes wide all the colors  come into focus and you look up to see jester to distract yourself from the sudden sensation youve  never experienced before the one thing you see is this fist connect with your chest and you all  watch as a series of blood vessels in the sides of beauregards face and neck suddenly burst and  splash blood in different directions you see white for a second your body racked with pain and  you recoil 
none	 briefly from the sudden shock to your system  travis with this flash of action i mask my voice and go ive got five gold on the horny one  marisha the fuck jester  laura i dont know  marisha boom boom boom im going to do some ip man like punching noises like all the way down  her spine right in the fucking ribs yeah going for that  matt youve got two attacks now  liam caleb is stress chewing on the licorice root that he used to cast the spell  matt you dont have 
none	 your shield for this because youre fist fighting so your ac is technically two lower  laura oh shit  marisha okay the first one definitely hits with a 20  laura yeah  marisha the second one is a 15  laura no it doesnt hit  marisha okay and then im going to spend a ki to do stunning strike  matt whats your ac normally  laura normally 18  matt yeah  travis shes cracking it out  marisha okay wait hang on  laura i should have done it 3rdlevel  marisha as in one 
none	 ki do i have to hang on sorry  matt you roll damage  marisha roll damage and then do i do  matt and then she has to make a saving throw i believe its a constitution saving throw  marisha not great damage seven damage  matt seven points of bludgeoning damage as she begins to pummel you repeatedly across the front  of the face down into the side of the torso and i need you to roll a constitution saving throw  please jester  laura oh god oh no  ashley you guys are fucking 
none	 each other up  laura five no six oh no  matt okay as she continues down your torso theres one portion on the back of your armor  where your spine is exposed beyond the clothing youre wearing and after she finishes the round  she uses the momentum and strikes straight into base of the spine where the nerve would divide  down to the pelvis and your entire body locks up all your muscles all spasm at once you are stunned  marisha can i have another attack action because of haste  laura i think i 
town	 pooped myself a little  travis i walk over to the other side of the crowd and go i got ten gold on the one with the  bandages trying to whip up a betting frenzy  matt the haste doesnt give you a fourth attack what does haste does is it gives you  liam an extra attack action  matt an extra attack action yeah you have your bonus action so yeah you can attack with your  staff if you want to whatever your main attack is and then you still have your bonus action  marisha 
none	 and i still have my bonus action  matt yes  marisha because my stunning strike didnt use my bonus action right  matt correct  marisha okay thats not great that misses it was a natural four  matt hold on she is stunned  marisha oh right shes stunned  matt attack rolls against her are at advantage you roll again  marisha thats a natural one  matt this hit you do pull back and hit the armor unfortunately and your fingers snap back a bit  you feel the numbness from the attack  laura that 
none	 was my shield  marisha you keep your shield in your ass  laura yeah  marisha ow then i have one more bonus action right  matt mmhmm  marisha okay thats good thats 19 to hit  matt that hits roll damage  marisha six  matt thats six bludgeoning damage to you as beau recoils from this and steadies herself from  this round jester you are unable to move youre sluggishly trying to get your joints to function  again you try and speak and it comes out in a stuttering phrase that fades away your 
none	 tongue not  listening to your impact  travis marisha and ashley chanting level five level five  marisha right in that sciatic nerve right in there  laura oh no it hurts already  matt too close to home  liam beat that practice dummy  matt that ends your turn back to beau  marisha im going to just do  matt you are no longer stunned  marisha once again take my staff out and im going to gut strike her right in the stomach the  first attack thats a natural 18  matt let me 
none	 double check and see when the actual stun wears off  sam and ill take five five gold ive got jester  matt until the end of your next turn so you still have advantage on attacks against her  marisha lets see if okay no ill take that 18 that first strike is 12 damage with my staff  matt 12 points of bludgeoning damage as the staff slams right into your clavicle shoulder area  almost knocking you off your feet  marisha then im supposed to state flurry of blows as my bonus right  matt correct 
none	 yes  marisha but i get one more attack and then i can do flurry of blows  laura im going to use my reaction because im not stunned to use hellish rebuke on you  matt technically youre still stunned until the end of her turn  laura fuck  liam is what jester thought  marisha second attack okay 18  matt 18 hits  marisha this is still my regular attacks  matt this is still the second strike with the staff after one knocking her back from the  shoulder blow  marisha im going to 
none	 do a six damage crack just right in her gut knock the wind out of her  matt the wind gets knocked out of you from a sudden blow to your stomach area  marisha and im going to do flurry of blows  laura oh no  taliesin blood curse of the eyeless full strength  matt all right go ahead and take your damage  travis on who  matt all of a sudden your vision goes black for whatever reason where we saw the brief burst of  the veins from the first strike from jester you 
none	 watch as bits of crimson begin to pour out the  corners of beaus mouth as her eyes go over black  marisha motherfucker  matt you dont have advantage its just a straight roll for your attacks  marisha okay first one 14  laura nope  marisha second one no even worse natural four  matt eventually your vision comes back but your knuckles hurt from the fact that you just punched  twice in the thickest parts of her breast plate  marisha and i have one more attack action right  matt because of haste you 
town	 do yes and that one has advantage  marisha mmhmm 14 20 total  matt that hits roll damage  marisha another 12 damage  laura aww no im unconscious  marisha oh shit  matt and with that  marisha it was pretty good though  matt jester got one good opening blow and then  laura and then caleb fucked me  matt i mean partially but you also chose a fist fight against a monk which is a rough scenario  marisha fight club  matt the whole crowd goes yeah  marisha sorry jester  matt 
tavern	 jesters unconscious  marisha oh wait i thought you were going to fjord im sorry  liam oh no im just being my same awkward self its fine  sam guys shes our healer  marisha oh shit  sam can someone shes dying right now  matt you watch as one of the patrons of the bar comes up with a small jug of  water and throws it in her face  laura coughing whoa  sam is she okay  matt shes at one hit point  laura that was seriously awesome  marisha so awesome dude 
none	 what did you do that was crazy  laura i would have done it worse but i thought we were taking it easy on  each other and then you went crazy on me  marisha well i got a little blood lusty after that im so sorry  laura i understand completely how come you were you hitting me so much though because usually you  dont have that much speed  marisha i dont really know do i know that he cast haste on me would i be aware of that  matt not at the moment no 
none	 and youre still affected by it  marisha i dont know maybe it was a relapse of the those mushrooms that molly and i did  i dont know  laura that was a while ago  travis talking super fast all coked up  marisha its really great i dont know i feel really good about myself right now  matt at about this point in the conversation the adrenaline leaves your body and you almost keel  over you become suddenly super lethargic and exhausted  marisha groans oh god  liam definitely the mushrooms  marisha were 
town	 going to take a nap after this right  travis nah were walking out of this city miles  marisha ah fuck  liam i send frumpkin over to start lapping the blood off of jesters face  laura oh hi frumpkin youre a little evil creature that drinks blood  matt the crowd begins to go back to their scenarios some of them seem confused by the  display of joyous hugging afterwards some seem to be down with it and are like  yeah this is what it is about  marisha i take my canteen and clean 
none	 jester up and trying to help her out now that the adrenalines  wearing off im feeling a little guilty  laura no its totally fine i did it to myself  matt sitting on one of the table edges you see dweez the little creepy gnome who you met  earlier whos like breathy laugh  laura i dont like him that was creepy  matt at this point a familiar voice kicks up from the back corner friends come sit thank  you for such a fine display of sportsmanship  travis thats us always down for a 
dung	 scrap  matt apparently the gentleman now sits there his comfortable attire today comes in a billowing  linen a dark navy blue shirt that frills at the wrists you can see his rings and jewelry  available as his fingers are crossed and partially stapled steepled in front of him not stapled to  him thats a whole different thing ah oh god  laura im going to use this time talking to him as a short rest  marisha yeah  matt and sam thats an hour  laura well hopefully  matt you spend an hour here 
dung	 and youll be fine thank you for coming so quickly  travis of course it didnt seem like our options above ground were all that plentiful we were more  than anxious to hear what you might offer  matt rather tenuous times these are wouldnt you say word is the breach of the ashguard  garrison was a massacre and now the skies there hang dark with illmagic im glad thats hundreds  of miles from here though now with the bulk of the military moving east and the crownsguard  stretched thin we should begin bolstering our plots 
none	 yes  travis oh  sam what does that mean  matt well a distracted empire is an easy empire to bend to our will or at least to not pay  attention to what were doing  travis indeed i assume it doesnt mean overthrowing it  more manipulating it to your individual gain  matt oh i have no interest in political endeavors just the more confused they are the  better for business  travis yes  matt i have a few possible jobs here if youre interested i dont mean to act so quickly but  
none	 word comes to me that you had been summoned to the kings hall i would hate to think i missed the  opportunity to get more work under your wing before losing you to some unfortunate statebased  conscription first order of business should you be interested he leans forwards and sets his  glass a little further from the edge his voice hushes a bit as he leans in ive some friends to  the north whom ive been needing to reconnect with allies who would be very profitable  partners in these times im rather strapped for attention 
tavern	 at the moment and i have a hard time  trusting some of these other louts with detailed missions  sam he means louis  matt anyway if you have any interests  marisha fucking louis  matt indeed you glance back over your shoulder and see louis at the bar whos still dazed and  drinking a giant cup of ale and wiping the blood off of his whole torso if youve interest in  making coin doing some interesting work and getting to see most of our beautiful imperial  countryside i can go on  liam ja 
dung	 who are these friends of yours up north  matt an old friend of mine named ophelia mardun she has a base of operations about 350  miles northeast of here past nogvurot and the quannah breach on the outskirts of shadycreek  run im sure youve heard of it  laura yes we have actually  matt a sovereign town outside of the dwendalian empire and outside of the law that uses the  savalierwood to keep the crown at bay spoken of as a haven for criminals thieves murderers but  really its home to the truly free 
none	 entrepreneurs of wildemount and criminals thieves and  murderers now ophelia is unable to enact on any partnerships at the moment as her current  business is tangled up in some of the local riffraff and shes requested aid in stabilizing  her situation what i propose as youve already proven yourselves effective problem solvers  selfstarters with enough sense of honor to see a deal through is for you all to travel northward  past the silberquel ridge to shadycreek run to parlay with ophelia help her in absolving her  from her current mire of complications and return 
none	 with her here to zadash for this task completed  i offer an advance of 500 gold pieces and a purse of 4500 gold pieces upon returning with miss  mardun within the month  sam question  matt yes  sam will she come willingly  matt she will once you manage to free her from her predicament  sam oh  liam complications predicament do you have any more specifics than that perhaps  matt i do not that is the intent and language she used when last we had correspondence i think  the nature of her 
none	 business much like ours is meant to be on an absolutely necessary basis only  im sure once you speak to her youll have better information on that  travis a tantalizing offer you said you had others  matt i do if this seems to be beyond your depth id hate to see the coin go to someone  else but i understand  liam no we are interested in more of a buffet here today  matt understood that underground tunnel that youve already visited happens to be a major  artery for our smuggling business leading straight 
dung	 up to the lebenda swamp the lebenda  swamp is a useful place to lose things or people until you need to find them as well as a direct  route to my contacts in berleben weve been rather worried that no shipments have made their  way south by the river in weeks after sending your friend up to berleben last week it was  discovered that our safe house and storage facility in the swamp has gone dark one of my  men as well as a handful of theirs in berleben went to investigate and never returned 
town	 now the  swampfolk are a superstitious lot an unfortunate facet with working with them  laura like swap creatures  matt and the like im sure of it my contacts in town are refusing to investigate recounting  howls from the deep swamp i would need you to head up to berleben locate a fellow named febron  keyes usually hangs around the keystone pub in the puddles the puddles is the part of the town  that is heh sinking hes my point man for shipments and the only one who knows where our  safe house in 
none	 the swamp is that hasnt gone fucking missing meet with him secure the safe  house and its contents and return to me consider a 250 gold piece advance and a purse of 1750 gold  pieces upon completion heck if you can handle both laughs and with timely mind there might be  a bonus  liam as a sidebar should we be worried about our friend that we sent north to that area  marisha yeah wheres horris  matt oh hes in berleben he should be fine this is all based in the swamp  laura leading 
none	 to berleben  travis could you describe your friend vabron  marisha liam and laura febron keyes  matt febron keyes chuckles hes memorable based by his fairly emanate lack of teeth his one  wandering left eye a bit of a skin condition  travis no grill busted eye okay  marisha i just drooled a little oh god  matt but hes good at the work he does  sam what work is that  matt keeping his mouth shut and knowing where the secrets are and not giving those secrets up  hes been pressed for it 
none	 a few times and has proven to be trustworthy and i admire that  travis would we have the same sort of timetable for this mission a month  matt the sooner the better as the longer these shipments continues to elude us the more money  were losing like i said a timely manner there may be a bonus  travis anything else  matt those are the two at the moment if those dont tickle your fancy im sure we could have  another opportunity in the next week or two i just would hate to see these 
none	 go to less qualified  individuals  travis well perhaps well partake of some beverages and discuss  matt of course  sam one more thing though our other offer was for 10000 gold seems like maybe you could match  that just to make it a little bit more equal  matt you mistake this business as some sort of a push for an inherently equal pay my friend i  dont know what business the crown wishes to offer you but i can guarantee you it has a ceiling  laura okay well the other side of that 
none	 was that we would get access to some potions and supplies  and stuff is this something you can provide to us when we go on missions for you  matt make a persuasion check  laura natural 20  cheering  laura i wipe a little blood from my mouth  marisha super endearing with that black eye  travis anime sparkles  matt youre leaning on one leg a little bit unintentionally leaning in  travis your one busted eye is wandering  liam return of the vex  matt im sure we could provide a few supplies 
none	 remember we try not to dip into our own  contraband but we could assume that we could provide some things yes  liam does that contraband include highquality paper and ink  matt we can provide paper and ink sure  marisha you know what contraband means right  liam highquality paper and ink  travis well learn him its all right  marisha okay  travis give us some time to discuss and well get back to you shortly  matt of course well drink be merry you know where to find me  travis is there an 
none	 open booth or  taliesin the darkest  travis yeah the darkest corner  sam or like a bumper pool table that we can all  matt there is that yeah its more like a shufflepuck thing with the sand on the side  liam just pacman table  matt yeah  taliesin galaga  matt the darkest table is the one that is tucked right inside the spiral staircase where you enter  marisha oh yeah  matt which normally has somebody sitting there but at the moment it looks like theyre getting a  drink if you swipe 
none	 it now youll probably piss somebody off but youll get the table  taliesin i pull the full riker hop over the chair  laughter  matt as you guys approach you can see the same muscular thuggish individual with the tanned skin  and the thick bracers around his rough and tumble exterior begins to approach with a large fully  filled flagon of ale who stops sees that youre sitting there and grumbles to himself and finds  another seat but you are as private as you can be in this relatively not private space you have a 
town	 table  travis well what do you think  laura i think it sounds like fun  marisha i agree  sam well molly youve been talking about getting out of town  taliesin and it is out of town  sam it gets us out of town  taliesin its almost perfectly out of town ive always wanted to go to deadwood  marisha weve already yeah how awesome does that place sound  laura shadygrove  marisha yeah  sam the shitty swamp  travis shadycreek run  laura no shadycreek well that would be probably the second 
none	 one right  marisha after yeah  taliesin i am feeling greedy  laura how do you feel about it yasha  ashley i am along for the ride  travis you have no preference  ashley i mean im up for all of it you know whatever you guys decide  travis any preference to water versus perhaps an abundance of dry ground  taliesin versus both  laura well i mean were all leaning more towards this than going to the menagerie coast for  the empire right  taliesin yeah it does sound like fun  marisha 
none	 yeah i dont like contracts we already gave our blood to this guy  taliesin were already in  laura that is as contracty as contract gets  marisha exactly  travis plus if this is as aggressive as they say it is an attack on the border im sure that  legionnaires job will be there when we return anyway price might have increased  marisha yeah seems like the empire has enough money to just throw at problems i dont think  thats going to change yeah  travis better to bet on the underbelly rising up than 
town	 the top maintaining what it has  sam also this way gets us to go straight through hupperdook  laura gasps it does we can stop by hupperdook  sam im just saying  travis remind me whats in hupperdook  laura i have no idea  sam its like a cool name for a town  laura i imagine that all of the buildings look like mushrooms  marisha theyve got a wax museum largest ball of twine  travis hupperdook  sam hupperdook  matt the branson of wildemount  marisha the branson of wildemount yeah i hope 
none	 it is  travis okay definitely stopping in hupperdook  sam theyve got a soft serve place there itll be great  travis so were going to take that shady underground river out  laura yes we have to be careful of those monsters that came out of the  sam we know those monsters though i took care of all those traps could someone remind me  because when the gentleman looks at me i get a little bit yeah you know flippityflee  travis turned on  marisha yeah thats it like into it  travis are you 
none	 crushing on him  sam no the sweat thing bothers me  laura its not sweat i think its  sam i think its sweat  laura im going to peek around and look at the gentleman  matt okay hes back at the far table hes currently drinking and it looks like he has a  small book of some kind that hes thumbing through  sam and laura is he moist  matt make a perception check  liam are you  travis how many of us are uncomfortable hearing that word  liam all of us  
none	 laura eight  matt in this low light its hard to see but when you were speaking to him earlier there was a  layer of general moisture across his skin  laura what kind of shirt is he wearing  matt the shirt hes wearing now is a navy blue linen billowy shirt open in the chest a bit you  can see a bit of his chest hair and frilled at the sleeves  laura the thing is if he was sweaty then why would he be wearing long sleeves  sam to hide all the sweat stains 
none	 on his undershirt i dont know its just weird right  like hes always sweating  laura he doesnt look like hes warm though normally when people are sweaty theyre going like  this breathing heavily  sam thats true  laura you know  sam yes anyway i missed the whole part about the swamp whats that mission again  what do we have to do  laura we go in we try to find fabron keyes and secure the safehouse in the swamp and theres  howling there so probably wolves or something  sam but wait find 
dung	 the safehouse and do what to it  laura secure it and come back and tell him where it is  sam secure it  travis yeah its gone dark right so either remove whatevers in there and get it back up and  running again  liam and hey dm knowing the empire how direct a route is it from fabron keyess area berleben to  shadycreek run  matt you have a map for that  marisha theres a map for that  taliesin ill get it  sam straight shot  liam we have to go around 
none	 some mountains right  matt you have to go around the silberquel ridge  taliesin oh thats up there  laura yeah so we need to go to berleben or we need to go to the swamp come back here and then go  marisha you have a printout  liam yeah  marisha i dont have a printout  sam yeah im special nott has a dot matrix printer  liam printer noises  travis thats a pretty good printer  liam berleben hupperdook is over here  sam oh yes it is  marisha and where are we 
none	  liam were down there  sam jester do you think people who live in hupperdook are called dookies  taliesin huppers  sam or huppers  marisha oh is it this the zubenda swamp is that what it is  matt lebenda swamp  laura i think we should call them dookies  sam we should call them dookies for sure  liam and shadycreek run was what area again did you say  matt quannah breach northeast of nogvurot  marisha northeast of what  liam quannah breach there it is were very close to berleben and then 
none	 it seems like quite a  marisha a trek  liam stray yeah a trek to  marisha well have to go here come back and then go again also if were going to go through  berleben anyway we might as well check in on horris  travis why  marisha to make sure hes like alive  laura what are we going to do if hes not  travis yeah  marisha not tell anyone  travis yeah  laura exactly wouldnt it be better if we just dont know  marisha schrödingers horris  travis yeah weve 
none	 held up our part of the bargain  marisha all right  sam if i may yasha were going to be really close to your old you know place where you lived  ashley may i see the map just to make sure  sam yes  liam xhorhas is over there  sam xhorhas isnt just here xhorhas goes all the way up here  ashley its pretty big but i mean im from the south anyway  matt actually northward is not xhorhas technically just east  laura the greying wildlands are in the north  matt yes 
none	 the greying wildlands are in the north  sam oh its the greying wildlands oh  liam if there is a chance to look in on horris if it is easy if it doesnt put us out you know  if its put right in front of us  travis yeah if hes there i just dont want to go out of our way looking for him and all of a  sudden have the guilt of you know  marisha yeah thats true i hate guilt  travis i mean dont get me wrong i like our efforts here 
none	 in the city i think weve done good  marisha yeah  travis hard to keep track of parties outside of our purview  liam i am over zadash  travis yeah just over it huh plus itll give us time to leave maybe things will change by the  time we come back or maybe not well see never know what happens outside  marisha so were going to take them all hop on both of his offers i think  liam well quite frankly i am a little more comfortable in quannah breach anyway  travis oh really 
none	  liam yeah  travis youre more nomadic  liam yeah  travis okay  marisha lets do it  travis lets do it yeah well pound our drinks keep them away from beau because  shell drink all of them  laura i just want to make sure were here for a full hour though im going to drink slowly  taliesin i can use a little yeah  laura im going to sip it  travis all right  marisha the exhaustion point lasts until you take a long rest  matt you dont get an exhaustion point 
none	 you just become stunned for a round  liam for a round its gone  marisha for the haste  matt yeah youre fine  liam its just a pain in the ass in combat not in out of combat  marisha oh once it wears off youre like  laura i thought you get a point of exhaustion after haste  liam no  matt no it just stuns you for one round which in combat is really bad  marisha okay  travis well leave molly and jester here to nurse their drinks and their short rests and 
none	 well go  back up and speak to the gentleman no  sam yes of course ill come with you fjord  travis yeah anybody thats not nursing a short rest  marisha im nursing a short rest  ashley ill go with you  liam yeah i will as well  taliesin are you going to be able to heal enough to  laura am i going to be able to heal enough what  taliesin for going down river or well i suppose its going to be  laura ill just use the one little spell  marisha 
tavern	 well be all right  taliesin oh thats well your hit points  travis is sorad the female goliath  matt oh sorah  travis sorah is she present in the tavern at the moment  matt she is shes not right by the gentleman shes actually sitting at the table in the or  sitting at the bar 15 feet away from him but shes always in his direction shes perpetually  hawking his presence and ensuring that nobody tries anything funny and that she can get there  quickly if she needs to  travis nice i will 
none	 approach  marisha thats cool  matt hes in the process of thumbing through a small book hes finishing a sip from his goblet  and watches you push ah that was quicker than i anticipated  travis indeed we have good news we have decided to take you up on your offer  matt which one  travis the lebenda swamp  laura all of it  travis the lebenda swamp is what weve decided to take you up on  matt very well and youre not choosing the shadycreek run  sam well will you be reassigning it 
none	 very quickly if we dont take it  matt i need it to be taken care of so if you wont do it ill find somebody else who can  laura hmmmm  matt time is of the essence here  sam thats the lebenda one  travis oh i thought we were doing the beginners course  laura were going to do that one and then the other one well say yes to both  travis oh were doing both  liam well well hope we can do both can we do both  matt you can indeed if 
none	 you do both ill be happy to reward you with something nice at the end  of it because thats quite a feat  travis apparently our ambition has no limit both it is  laughter  travis fucking  matt very well well im happy to know were doing business together once more i would  recommend if youre heading to berleben and lebenda swamp to take the bromkiln byway we do  have the river but one you have quite a number of individuals that arent the most quiet and  there are certain things that exist throughout 
none	 that 70ish mile journey youd be taking underground  travis by water or also on foot  matt either way its still 70 miles to berleben thats a long journey to take  underground if you are  laura not quiet  matt not quiet and inconspicuous our smuggling run usually goes in groups of two to three at most  to keep it quick and unseen  liam when you say underground are you speaking metaphorically or do you literally have a way  underground to get there  matt youve already been there  liam the river goes 
town	 that far  matt yes  laura the passage that we were in  liam yeah we took that for an hour not 70 miles  matt which is why im saying if you choose to otherwise thats up to you but i would recommend  taking above ground on the bromkiln byway its a wellcarried road it sees a lot of foot traffic  shouldnt be that dangerous and its nearly a straight shot to the swamp  sam it sounds like its going to be no sweat well stay high and dry  liam what would we have 
none	 to be wary of in the river  matt whatever decides to take up residence down there  travis do we still have the cart and the two horses  taliesin of course we have the cart and the two horses yeah we have the cart at least  matt you have five horses if i recall  taliesin we have horses horses for days  sam crapper shitter wc toilet john  marisha i wrote them down  travis were unfortunately a little short on transportation we could use a few horses  matt seeing as how youre accepting 
none	 both that would put you in the business of acquiring the  advance from both so that would be dweez please retrieve the advances 750 theres a  brief break before you hear the familiar chuckling and three large sacks are put up onto  the table 750 gold the advances for both missions  travis outstanding jester did have an excellent question well need certain remedies especially  near the water anything that you can provide that might put us in an advantageous position would be  most appreciated  matt dweez gather what we can spare from the 
none	 supply cabinet please he wanders off for a  moment and comes back with two small overtheshoulder satchels he sets them on the  table chuckling opens the little lids for them and pushes them forward you watch as one of them  falls forward and clattering out a few inches or so some vials in there the one on the right  should be able to tend to any wounds you sustain along the journey the one on the left can aid  you should you find yourself pricked with some terrible disease  laura poison and healing got 
none	 it  matt disease not poison unfortunately we have not that  sam one of each  matt two vials in one of healing theyre both of greater healing the other one is cure disease  liam paper and ink  matt we can provide you with paper and ink should you be so interested dweez  marisha didnt you buy a fuckton of paper and ink youve used it all  liam ive used it  travis do you know what is also as valuable as resources is knowledge in this swamp area are  there any particular hazards 
none	 that we should keep an eye out for that your men have seen repetitively  matt none that ive cared to remember that would be more of a question to my ally there if  you dont mind speak with febron he is very familiar with the area and can give you the  information you seek  travis i wouldnt presume to be as lucky as to have louis have tried this mission before and  fucked it up as well has he  matt no i would not ensure such a mission to him he glances past you 
tavern	 in the far corner you  can see him now leaning over the bar two full cups in starting to get a little dazed on the stool  travis hey louis fuck you  matt his hand does this  travis yep hes a winner  laura you will get 107 gold  matt anything else you require  sam no this has really whet our appetite  travis swamp pun  liam sure  sam i just cant stop staring at his face its soaking wet sorry  matt anyway if our business is complete i appreciate your patronage 
none	 i look forward to our  continued partnership and i wish you all the luck  laura thank you  matt thank you  sam dont sweat the small stuff  travis fucking shit  liam caleb hangs back all by himself and says stuttering paper and ink  matt dweez comes up from behind a moment later with a stack of regular parchment and ink he  hands it over it does not look like it would be the necessary enchanted or prepared inks that you  could use to scribe spells per se but its parchment and ink 
none	  liam ja danke okay  travis this is very exciting two missions at once  laura well one and then oh i run back to the gentleman should we come back here after the  first part or should we continue on and take care of them both and then come tell you  matt thats up to you i cant pay you unless you come back but if you complete them both and  do so in ample time ill be happy to pay you when you return from both just send word if you  could upon 
none	 clearing our safehouse  laura that way you know we did it timely and we can get that bonus part  matt precisely  laura okay  matt all right thank you very much good luck  sam just going to leave a handkerchief just in case  matt he just glares at you glowering at nott as you all step away from his corner of the chamber  travis well its still a really good time in the day we should go ahead and make preparations make  our way back up  taliesin were already ready to leave 
none	 at a moments notice  laura yeah we already packed our rooms up  sam theres nothing at pumats anymore  laura no more pumats  matt youve almost cleared out between you and other patrons in the recent weeks theyve cleared  him out its not an endless emporium  travis as we pass that big ogre on the way out i say kutha keep it real all right  matt as you do that he turns around and a hand slaps onto your shoulder the finger and thumb of  it go from the front of your chest 
none	 to your small back as it grapples you and spins you around and  goes grunts and then releases you  travis thats a big hand  laura as i leave i flick the wand of smiles at him again  travis fucking kutha cant catch a break  matt four  laughter  matt as he peels his large mitt off of fjords body and grunts he turns to the rest of the chamber  sam here it is  laughter and pained yelling  matt he starts pulling at his jaw its almost like getting a charlie horse 
none	 where you cant stop  the muscles and he tries to stop it  ashley the wand of smiles  laura now i feel guilty  matt eh he probably deserved it you guys ascend the stairs back into the main front of the evening  nip and the rest of the afternoon is yours what would you like to do  travis i mean we can head over to the cart and horses  ashley should we just get that started and well go  liam i am going to run over to pumats to buy some paper and 
none	 ink  travis more  liam im gone  matt okay caleb is just  marisha i join caleb because i went pee last time when you guys went to go to pumats  travis okay theres nothing there  laura its cleared out  matt well theres some things  travis but you can finally kill him if you want to  laughter  marisha ah shit there are four more  matt massacre in downtown zadash this afternoon  travis as you run off i say meet us at the cart and horses  marisha all right super 
none	 fast  matt as you guys charge over to the pentamarket you make your way to the exterior of the  invulnerable vagrant stepping inside there is a rather chill customerless interior as two of  the regular pumats sit at the front as you step into the chamber oh youre back so soon i  figured you had completed all your intended means of purchasing  liam ja this is a quick stop i dont want to take up too much of your time and we dont have  much we have a busy day planned i was wondering 
none	 if you had perhaps maybe 100 golds worth more  of that good paper and ink that you have supplied me with already  matt i can go ahead and look youre starting to really diminish our stockpile  liam oh ja i am sorry also i am in need of maybe 2030 golds worth of fine incense if you  have that as well  matt that im pretty sure we can supply is that right you checking the back  i know it was there yesterday we got plenty of incense dont worry we got you covered he 
none	  comes back in with two sacks of very strong pungent smelling incense that when burning has  a more pleasant scent these have been treated specifically for rituals and various arcane means  you get 30 gold worth of incense at your disposal and the 100 gold worth of enchanted inks and  scribing materials and paper that you can utilize to make those notes and transition it into a spellbook  liam is there anything that you wanted to purchase while we are here  marisha a little birdy told me there might be bracers here  matt 
none	 thats one of the few items we have left yeah i apologize its a little embarrassing  weve all been talking about how its really embarrassing  its hard to have a shop without inventory  marisha bracers  matt oh yeah right over here goes and pulls one of the boxes from the shelves it has a glass  top and he presents it to you theres a velvet interior with two little alcoves inside where  these very beautiful silver bracers with scrolling and runic sigils carved into it across  the band are present these would make 
none	 a better defensive capability for someone who does not  themselves partake in the use of armor  marisha oh i dont partake in the use of armor  matt well that sounds like its meant to be  marisha uhhuh how much  matt 1200 gold pieces  marisha holy shit pumat the fuck  matt what  marisha ill come back when im fucking rich aight  matt okay theyll be here waiting for you  marisha all right  liam holy shit pumats  marisha holy shit pumats  matt thank you thank you thank you thank

none	 keep yourself alive  liam we are very appreciative and i dont know if you have already but you should look into some  sort of membership card or frequent customer points  marisha stamp punch  matt ill go ahead and bring it up with the big guy himself  marisha ten visits  taliesin nine potions the tenth ones free  matt fantastic  liam thousand golds worth of paper and the 11th ream is free well go now  matt yeah okay thank you  marisha we go very quickly bolt over to the cart  matt

none	 just sometimes it goes away then it  comes back im confused  liam frumpkin can be here or frumpkin can be there and right now he is here  ashley can i touch him  liam he would like you to touch him yeah but respectfully  laura when someone kicks him and he poofs does he automatically go to the other place or does he  die for a little bit and come back  liam no i think its pretty instantaneous and honestly i am so glad to have him but i think  that it is 
none	 probably nicer on the other side does your mother ever read stories about the feywild  and sprites and blumpkins thats not the word  laura my mother never did but the traveler told me lots of stories  liam of the feywild  laura of everywhere  travis the feywild is it like another city  liam its another plane of existence that is a mirror slightly off of our own with us but apart  from us at all times  laura theres faeries and that is how the unicorns get over here  travis one thing at 
none	 a time  ashley hes making a very strange noise right now  travis whats it sound like  ashley purring  liam that means he likes you  sam did you not have cat where you grew up  ashley no i have heard of cats but frumpkin is one of the first  sam did they have dogs  travis only rats that they ate  ashley thats true we have lots of rats we have many creatures  laura do you have wolves  ashley yeah  marisha what did you keep as pets  ashley we 
none	 didnt really have any  marisha you didnt have any pets  ashley no  marisha oh  ashley but i like him  liam i tell frumpkin to nestle in and he starts doing that thing where they claw their way in when  theyre getting cozy it hurts but its also lovable at the same time  marisha making biscuits  matt roll for kitty biscuits  travis pure death fucking anaphylactic shock  liam then i stop talking to everybody and i start transcribing things  travis i guess ill take the lead and well make our 
dung	 way out the city heading northeast right  taliesin north  marisha and laura to the swamp  travis to the bronchial byway  matt the bromkiln yeah the bronchial byway the life breath of the land  marisha we ruin everything matt creates  liam sometimes you do make them bulletproof and we get mad but most of the time we can crack the code  matt i enjoy it and im sure every dungeon master out there who watches knows exactly how i  feel when it happens you gather your things up into the cart the horses 
none	 begin to push off and  you make your way through the city streets of zadash to the northern wall you can still see  some of the townsfolk coming out and going about their day but the general air of tension and  nervousness still holds court throughout the citys streets there are clusters of crownsguard  theyre escorting the righteous brand to the eastern side you make your way to the northern  side of the city where the signet wall district begins where you have the large fortresses where  the military stays and the barracks that 
town	 surround that region to the large gate that exits the  building out into the rest of the marrow valley as you make it through the large raised  portcullis along with a few other folks that are in the process of making their own journey into  the north or to the west or to the east you step out onto the dirt road into the green blowing  fields the cold breeze thats blowing beneath the graying skies of wildemount and you push off  being here for a while it seems strange but also welcoming to be 
town	 back on the open road for a  moment you glance around and take a deep breath as that clean postrain air still seems to linger  in the vicinity as you make a sweep on the horizon with the rolling hills and patches of  trees catch your vision off to the far east on the outside of the signet wall district you see  hundreds if not thousands of soldiers all gathered and making their way east in small  troops here the mainstay source the bulk of military power in the center of the empire makes  
town	 its way to war you see horses siege engines and large ballista on wheels all being carried and  prepared for the journey to the borders of xhorhas and beyond with that you pick up and continue  northward making your way long the amber road towards to where the bromkiln byway carves off to  your destination first i want to ask you guys what pace are you travelling at you can go slow  pace if you try to be super stealthy normal pace is fine fast pace you go quickly but you  threaten exhaustion if you 
town	 continue to push that way  travis i think well go at a regular pace until we get to the bromkiln byway at the amber road  we should be all right  matt youre looking at about a 75mile journey with the cart and the horses youre looking at  about 30 miles a day at a normal pace youre probably looking at two nights stay on the road  before you reach your destination  laura and marisha okay  matt you guys push forward and watch as behind you the large looming walls and towers and  
town	 buildings of zadash that had been your home for weeks disappear slowly behind you once again  youre embraced by the wilds and open landscapes of the valley you take a moment to reflect upon  the insanity and craziness of the urban atmosphere and the peace as well as the unknown that comes  with traversing such an open plain id say you have maybe a few hours before the sun sets right  as you hit the intersection between the amber road and the bromkiln byway the sun has set the sky  is dark the clouds prevent 
town	 starlight from coming through and what moonlight would be visible is  choked giving you only the faint glimmer of the moons location behind the cloud cover  what would you like to do  sam its nighttime now  matt it is  laura i bet someones going to try to jump out at us  sam we should not let them do that  laura they do that to people that are on the open road  sam why would you tell me that now im very scared  travis are there any tree clusters or rock clusters 
none	 or boulders or anything that provides shelter  matt at your current location make a perception check with disadvantage because it is nighttime  travis im the wrong person to be doing this  taliesin i was going to say i was hoping to find the same thing  marisha i put on the goggles  matt then you can both make individual rolls or one of you can aid the other  travis ill aid you  matt you take your advantage on your roll  taliesin nope that was a two with advantage  marisha what did you 
none	 roll a one and a two  taliesin a two and a one  laura thats really shit  matt as the night has fallen and you spend the better part of the next hour trying to look for  any physical representation of safety or cover it is just open rolling hills and field there might  be places where you could stay low and perhaps keep relatively safe but nothing that sticks out  to you unfortunately what do you plan to do  laura we should probably pull over or something and look around and see  
town	 travis just off the road is fine at this point id like to see the road as well that way we can  see anyone coming  marisha can i go ahead and light a torch see if i can start a fire gather some wood  matt which is a good thing because it gets cold at night out here  sam did we bring any warm clothes  liam were going north  sam were the worst  matt itll only get colder the further north you go even at night here most mornings in  wildemount at 
none	 least this area of wildemount all the grass is frosted the windows are frosted few  moisture survives the evening without some sort of frozen state as the temperature begins to plummet  continuously after sunset you begin to find a place to set up camp for the evening beau takes  the torch ignites it and sets a small fire you begin to set up a small circle and maintain warmth  by taking what bits of and its very sparse vegetation if you want to check for anything to  keep the fire going roll a survival check 
none	  marisha not great ten  matt you manage to get some brush gathered youre probably not going to be able to keep the  fire going all night  liam i donate the paper that the gentleman gave me  laura thats a fast burn thats not going to last very long  travis i have a torch as well  taliesin ive got a torch  matt lets say if you throw in three torches thatll keep a modicum of the flame going through  the night not the most heat but itll be enough to prevent you

none	 could we stole clothing and  provisions but when times were tough we would steal the people too  travis you and your brothers and sisters or you and your children or parents  sam well goblins dont really im sure i have parents  travis oh but youre not super tight with them  sam yeah once a child is born and nursed for a bit and then its communal property as soon as  you can work they give you a job and you do the job  travis no favorite brother or sister or playmate or  
none	 laura do you even know who your brothers and sisters are  sam everyone in the clan i assume is related somehow but  laura oh  sam yeah there was no real family ties  travis do you fight any urges when you see a small child walking through the city to go up  and i dont know i dont mean any disrespect but to snatch it  laura that sounds a little shitty fjord  marisha thats definitely a little shitty  ashley but yeah you dont see it and you dont get hungry  travis yeah 
none	 no im being honest because if i know theres a little kid running around and if  youre fucking tracing the damn thing i want to know that i can put a hand out  liam with all due respect she is smarter than that  sam caleb as always is right i do not have an urge to kill and eat children  travis just checking i havent met many that do so pardon my you know  sam i do have cravings for things i assume you other species do not  laura like what maybe we do 
none	  sam rats  ashley well that i understand  sam cats sometimes  liam frumpkin goes back to the feywild  sam bacon i really like bacon  laura everyone likes bacon bacon is super good  sam just in general meat is pretty good but no a human child is a wonderful thing why would i  want to kill or hurt a human child  laura yeah she doesnt want to hurt her baby caleb  sam no im not bloodthirsty i just get hungry for food sometimes not for flesh i just like meat  marisha

dung	 thisll be funny come on first good roll of the day thatll do thats a 16  matt thats enough as you guys are continuing about midday or so youre hitting the noonday  sun and some of the clouds have broken up briefly you notice a tiny distant curl of smoke  over one of the hills just a lazy little line of darkness across the  taliesin does it look like happy fire smoke or bad unfortunate somethings burning dark  matt it looks very localized  sam listen everyone this is what happened to me here is 
none	 my definite backstory  taliesin no well do this later do you see the smoke over there  sam one day  taliesin loudly everybody theres smoke over there weve got to get hold of this right now  theres definitely a plume of smoke i dont know what it means i dont know what its about it  could be a good thing it could be a bad thing but we have to stop this conversation right in its tracks  sam all right what is it does it look like good smoke or bad smoke  taliesin honestly 
town	 i cant tell from here its very localized  laura is it into the woods or is it further along  taliesin is it into the woods or further along  matt you cannot see its over one of the larger hills thats blocking what its source is its  about a mile or so off of the road if you were to go ahead in that direction  taliesin its about a mile off the road  marisha its just chimney smoke just keep moving  taliesin it doesnt look like chimney smoke im not sure  travis so 
none	 theres fire so what  marisha campfire smoke  taliesin does it look like campfire smoke  matt it could be it could be chimney smoke its not a billowing column  marisha its not a billowing column  sam when you say it it has such a different color to it  taliesin theres people though or something  sam theyre burning people  taliesin i mean just be on alert they could be burning anything  sam we call that a barbecue  laughter  taliesin well find once and for all the answer what do children taste 
town	 like  matt continuing onward about ten minutes later you get just around the edge of where that hill  was and you can see the source of the smoke there nestled between a small cluster of trees  and a bit of natural rock formations a small shack that the smoke is coming from  laura its a small shack  matt continue going forward on the road  laura should we go knock on the door  travis did you want to see if somebody worth bargaining with or something  liam why dont we send my cat 
none	  travis sure  marisha weird people live in shacks in the woods  taliesin theyll be happy to see a cat  travis send the cat  taliesin i dont think were even going to pull over  laura no well just keep going  travis is the shed from where we are now still like a mile away  matt yeah its about a mile away  liam if its of interest we can turn around  laura the shack is a mile away  liam a mile away  liam oh  laura can frumpkin be a 
none	 bird  liam reluctantly yeah  taliesin for a bit  travis i want to check out the shack  liam all right for you fjord i will make frumpkin a bird  laura not for me though caleb hates me  sam we could just walk over there its a hassle to turn him into a bird  travis yeah keep your cat  liam you are more sensitive than i would have imagined  laura i want people to like me  liam youre so tough but everybody here likes you  sam yashas leading the way  
none	 laura youre checking out the shack  liam i was just about to make a really cool owl are we really okay  marisha a really cool hour  matt yashas going to the shack is it just yasha  taliesin im following  travis im going too  liam wait shes going to the shack  travis yeah  matt okay so yasha molly and fjord are heading to the shack  ashley well be right back  liam i put frumpkin back on her shoulder  matt as you guys make your way up cresting the hill down 
none	 into this small localized valley  toward where the shack is with the clusters of trees and the edge of a small forest cluster is a  little bit past it you approach the shack and as you get towards it you get a better look at it  its made of simple masonry and stones lodged together to create the outer walls of it it cant  be more than 20 feet by 20 feet in size its not a large abode there is one brick chimney where  that single curl of smoke that was visible off your 
none	 end was there theres a wood chopping block  on the outside with an axe embedded and left in it with couple of pieces of firewood off to the side  theres a tanning easel set there for whoever has been utilizing it there is a front door you see  a window that has no glass in it its maybe that big or so its more for keeping an eye out or  looking through it  travis scanning the land and the trees around doing a quick onceover of the close area  matt perception check  travis 
none	 six  matt looks fine  travis looks clear  taliesin great  travis ill head around back  ashley okay im going to get off my horse  matt you get off the horse  liam im going to start looking through frumpkin in an attempt to let yasha know i am with her i  make frumpkin do this to her forehead knocking with his paw  matt this soft paw starts tapping you in the face  ashley spitting stop it  liam oh thats a good question i know that we were looseygoosey with familiar things 
none	 i know  that weve said that i can see this far away but i probably cannot make him do that this far away  matt command right  liam 100 feet i take it back  matt you still blow and the fur gets in your nose fjord you head around back in the back  theres a couple of cured and salted meats that are hanging from the back of the ramshackled roof  that ends and curves down a bit over time the weathering has caused it to curl under there is  another doorway that leads 
none	 in the back it looks like there is no window back here there is a  single window out front and there are two doors in the front and back of it  travis ill make my way another quarter way around the house so i can see yasha and molly and  ill say go ahead ill keep an eye out i can see both  ashley im going to knock on the door yeah  taliesin that seems fair  ashley knocking  matt you hear a little bit of rustling a couple heavy footsteps you hear a 
none	 large metal rod shift  and it creaks open about two to three inches there you see what i can only describe as an  elderly fullblood orc his head wreathed and tangled grey coarse hair like a crown around the  top of the head that goes past the mouth and over the chest to about midpoint there a footlong  beard around his chin that ends at about the bottom of the clavicle or the sternum muscular  and hunched his graygreen skin looks thick and weathered and folded crows nests under where the  nose and the 
none	 mouth is the two heavy tusks protruding from underneath the lower jaw his eyes  are sunken and bloodshot around the side of the yellow sclera one hand opens the door while  another one remains out of sight as the face pushes forward to inspect you a low voice says  your business  ashley oh yes hello we were just passing through and we saw some smoke so we just wanted  to make sure everything was okay and come over here and check on you but you seem to be fine  matt everything is fine  
town	 taliesin selling any wares or do you need any news from the other side of the road  matt have you news to share  taliesin there are skirmishes at the border and soldiers are moving east lots of them worth  noting were trying to avoid it  matt good to know the door begins to close  ashley but did you have i dont think you answered the other part of what he was saying do  you have any wares for  taliesin for sale  ashley for sale  matt leans further in  ashley like 
none	 some meats  matt make a charisma check  taliesin oh yeah  ashley now i have a minus two guys  taliesin yeah thats still  ashley yeah 11  matt okay all right  ashley shimmy the shake  matt glaring at you with one eye peeking through theres a bit of a grunt and the breath emanates  and it smells of heavy pepper and dust a bit of smokiness to it the door opens slightly more and  the head peeks through to give you a good look over maybe for trade  ashley what kind 
none	 of trade  matt what do you have to trade  sam the cat  matt reaches out and  ashley no  sam yeah do it  ashley im just moving him around i cant  taliesin we have some bits and pieces what do you need we have gold but you dont really  strike me as the type who cares  matt gold doesnt hurt other passersby  taliesin ive got a few bits what do you need do you need tools  matt tools are helpful  taliesin im going to pull out  matt vegetables 
town	 fresh produce maybe  taliesin do we have anything fresh produce were a little thin on because were just on the road  but we do have  ashley we might have some bacon  matt he opens the door a bit further and looks to the left he looks to the right youre off to the  side of the wall though so you dont see him and he doesnt see you he goes come in and opens  the door fully and steps back you can now see he had in the other hand a really nastylooking  
none	 somewhat rusted battleaxe that he had right around the door just in case he goes and sets the loop  of the handle of it and puts it over a knob thats in the wall and then steps inside his small hovel  as you look in the inside its fairly bare but there are lots of furs that have been skinned and  cured that are up on the walls that are hanging from wolves from badgers different other  creatures that hes probably hunted and brought in here for the tanning process you see hanging on  the 
none	 edge a handmade piece of hide armor that has been recently stained and as soon as you get  close you can smell the stained scent off of it you get the sense here based on the tanning stuff  set up outside that thats probably part of his trading business  taliesin thats a nice piece of hide armor thats very nice  matt its also for trade or purchase also i have meats i have pelts  ashley how much are you selling the hide armor for  matt he thinks to himself for a second and considers 
none	 the time and energy hes put into it  handmade 15 gold pieces  taliesin how about 16 gold pieces and you throw in a little bit of meat  matt i give you two pounds of meat  taliesin perfect  matt he coughs a bit goes over and starts grabbing the armor and pulling it off of the knob  and setting it down grabbing some meat he opens the back door and steps out and starts pulling it  off of some of the racks of nails on there  travis i can hear it but i 
none	 cant see it  matt yeah youre staying where you are  travis ill start making my way over to their horses having heard them go inside i think  liam i would say caleb has been narrating this to everybody back  matt okay make a perception check  taliesin ten  matt ten okay he grabs the meats sets them in a small sack ties it up hands it over the armor  he preps and folds and sets over hands it to you  taliesin i pay the man pleasure doing business with you be careful theres

town	  matt so he got advantage  marisha plus but you said advantage oh right  travis ten  matt you glance off and maybe about 30 minutes up the road you can see a small forest maybe two  or three miles in diameter its a cluster of trees and would probably be a way  to camp off of the road  travis theres a cluster of trees up ahead we could aim for that  taliesin thatll do  travis lets do it  taliesin what kind of meat is this out of curiosity  matt make

none	  liam the second does not hit but the first one obviously does  matt all right you suffer five points of piercing damage as the arrow catches you right in  the left pectoral muscle and i need you to make a constitution saving throw  marisha what was that  travis poison arrow  laura or a sleep arrow  sam or a health cure arrow  liam not great ten  matt you feel this burst of poison begin to pulse through your veins you are considered poisoned  as you guys all see this happen you 
none	 glance around and you can see a bunch of small shapes beginning  to skitter from around some of the trees this growling sound almost barking sound theres a  few strange furred wolves emerging from one side two or three of them their eyes glistening as the  light from the fire manages to catch it from an angle behind them these two heavy forms begin to  emerge and one of them goes oh no theyve awakened gonah i know emmett and well come  back to roll initiative here as were going to take a quick break

none	 flicker and cool to this  low orange glow from the vibrant yellow flame it was before as yasha steps past the flame behind  the shawl two large skeletal black wings emerge from the back of her shoulder blades  sam like real or like seethrough  ashley can they see it because its only if youre within ten feet of the person  matt it has that effect but its still visible im pretty sure  ashley okay yeah i think youre right the effect is only  matt the effect is only within ten feet  sam 
dung	 are they real or are they seethrough  matt you look at a somewhat translucent skeletal wing structure with membranous undeadlooking wings  travis what the shit  matt as that happens this dark energy emanates from her body and for a second the white tips of  her hair go completely black as she steps forward striding with her blade in her hands  travis electric guitar riff  matt currently nott youre the only one who can see this but her eyes go jet black entirely full  darkness a void of light where her eyes once were 
none	 as this happens and she strides forward charisma  saving throw on his point there  travis on all of our points  matt well youre more than ten feet unfortunately he does succeed however you do  manage to maintain the rest of your ability  ashley okay so now i have an attack because of extra attack  matt yep you have two attacks oh no this is an action to do that so no you cannot attack  this round  ashley even the extra action  matt no because you get two attacks for the attack 
dung	 action but thats your action  ashley well id like to rage  matt yes you may as you step up to this ogre your wings unfurled you give out this heavy yasha  roar that echoes in the space around you as your wings flex out even further this dark energy  pulling in and the ogres like confused grunts looking taken aback by this unexpected  display of power  travis we might need a mini for that because that sounds awesome holy shit  matt going to have to look into that is that your turn yasha

none	 their strikes against you because theyre coming at you from  flanking you as a wolf first one is going to be  laura caleb fucking me again  matt a 20 on the first one not a natural 20  laura natural 20  matt no thats going to be double 19s on that one jesus christ im rolling really good  tonight both hit you  travis so celebratory  matt i am im excited the first one is going to be eight points of piercing damage and the other  one is going to be nine points

none	 in freezing cold energy as you yell in  response to its assault  laura you stay away you piece of its okay  matt as you pull back and look the wolf is frozen solid and tumbles into a bunch of ice  chunks off the battlefield that ends the wolfs turn top of the round beau youre up  marisha im going to unleash on this ogre in front of me  matt go for it  marisha i have the ogre and the wolf right  matt yep  marisha ill do my first two attacks on 
none	 the ogre natural 18 on the first one and the second one  sucks at a four with a ten total  matt that misses the first one hits  marisha okay goddamn it six damage  matt six points of damage  marisha ill go ahead and do a flurry of blows for my bonus  matt so you have two more strikes against the ogre as well  marisha yeah lets unleash into the ogre okay 19  matt 19 hits  marisha and 14  matt 14 also hits roll damage on both of those d4s on 
none	 those  marisha okay ten damage on the first eight on the second  matt nice 18 points of damage on it that finishes beaus turn it is now the goblins go  liam what happened to me i havent gone in a while  travis yeah youre next  matt you come after the goblins dont worry youre coming this one here whos up against  you molly is going to throw the shortbow over its shoulder pull out its scimitar and lash out  towards you thats going to be a 15 to hit  taliesin ac is 
none	 15  matt that hits then you suffer five points of slashing damage it strikes across you backs up  pulls its shield up and is getting ready to defend itself from whatever assault you bring back  at it its going to stay right there because its liking the tree cover to its side but  keeping an eye over its shoulder to fjord who tried to fire at it previously these two goblins  are going to step out and theyre going to both fire at fjord who is advancing towards them that  is going to be 
none	 a 20 to hit  travis that hits  matt and a ten to hit  travis does not hit  matt one arrow the other manages to catch you in the side of the neck and stick in before it falls  out of the wound not deep enough to stick you too hard but you do suffer eight points of piercing  damage thats max damage and i need you to make a constitution saving throw  travis 24  matt you resist the poison no issue this one is going to use the rest of its movement 
none	 to dart  behind there this ones going to move behind there these two here that are along with nott are  going to ignore nott this one is going to start moving this way towards where the cart ran off  and its off the grid there this one is going to saunter up right next to nott and make a shot at  yasha thats a natural 17 so its going to be 21 to hit you are raging though so you take half  damage which is good thatd be seven points of piercing damage reduced to 
none	 three so you take  three points of piercing damage you do have to make a constitution saving throw all of the  arrows they have are dipped in some sort of a toxin or venom  taliesin whats the effect of the toxin or venom again  matt it poisons they get the poisoned condition  ashley i rolled a natural one  matt with that even in your form the poison begins to take hold and where the wound catches  you off the side of the throat and the back of the head the veins begin to 
none	 pulse black as the poison  begins to take hold you are poisoned  laura youre still really cool looking though  matt you dont take any additional damage but currently all of your attacks are at  disadvantage  marisha it goes really well with the wings  matt it does actually  laura thats what poison does you get disadvantage on all your attacks if youre  poisoned  matt poisoned disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks  laura that sucks  matt its pretty rough that ends that guys turn theres one goblin back here seeing 
none	 that  molly is currently engaged its going to rush up behind and attempt to flank the back of him its  going to make a strike with its scimitar with advantage because its flanking you thats  cocked even its highest roll there is a seven plus four thats 11 it goes to strike and you  see it coming hearing the little footsteps behind you you duck out of the way as it strikes  hitting air and now youre holding them off on both sides i think thats all of them that have  gone so that 
none	 is going to lead us to caleb  liam im poisoned so any attack rolls are at disadvantage correct  matt correct  liam im going to struggle to my feet and im going to cast sleep over and away in that  direction so it falls way back behind the ogre and these two wolves the goal is to get the ogre  and two wolves just on the edges of it so it doesnt hit any of my friends im aiming far  behind them to get them on the perimeter  matt to get these two here 
none	  liam the wolves are the primary goal stopping short of jester they are the wall the outer edge  matt go ahead and roll the points for sleep its not concentration so you get to maintain slow  travis what does a 20foot sphere look like on the map four squares  matt 20foot radius  travis yeah 20foot sphere jesus  marisha thats fucking big  ashley wait did you get the little goblin back there  matt the 20foot radius sphere  travis it just says 20foot sphere  liam bad roll 13 hit points total  
none	 matt 13 hit points total this one falls unconscious that one stays up  travis areas 20 feet so it should be  matt ten foot radius then that would be there half the size  liam i got to standing which would take half my movement so im going to use my last 15 feet to  get exactly opposite to the other side of the wall by sliding around it and killing jester  laura youre alive how did  liam haha funny joke  matt fjord youre up  travis ill use my 30 feet to run 
none	 towards this goblin  matt five ten 15 20  travis great and i will use booming blade to make a melee attack against him  matt all right go for it  sam texas drawl booming blade  matt as you draw your falchion out of the side you focus on it and as you do so this spark of  electrical thunder energy engulfs the edge of it as you strike downward  travis that is 18 plus seven 23  matt that hits roll damage  travis its a d8 plus the thunder damage this is the 
none	 first time ive used it im real excited  counting  matt an additional 1d8  travis eight so 18 points  matt 18 point of damage with that as you cut down into the goblin the blade sinks in partway  through the torso and then the burst causes it to tear apart in two different directions exploding  spattering across the tree and the side of the ogre thats ten feet in front of you doesnt seem  to notice  travis with booming blade is that just one of my two attacks per action  matt no 
none	 its an action to use the cantrip then you get an attack as part of it so you have to  decide between doing two attacks with your invocation that you took or  travis lesson learned and ill use the rest of my action to get up on the back  matt your movement  travis yeah im sorry the rest of my movement so thats 20 25 30  matt youre not quite flanking you have to get one more square to be flanking with yasha but  yasha can possibly move and make that flanking on your 
none	 turn if youd like  that ends fjords turn molly youre up  sam yeah mollymauk  taliesin im going to get the one in front of me first attack thats all right thats 19 to hit  matt 19 hits that works  taliesin thats eight points of damage  matt eight points of damage as you carve through it cuts a giant gash down the front of  its body to part of its thigh its wounded very badly but still standing  sam what did you attack  matt carved that goblin right there  taliesin one 
none	 more 19 to hit  matt thatll hit  taliesin thats nine points of damage  matt what you do is you strike once and it sticks into his body then as hes still living  you double down push and force it the rest of the way down carving it in half and it splits in  half and is destroyed  taliesin im going to turn around to the one thats behind me im going to take a third hit  matt striking down overhand towards it behind you  taliesin 12  matt total of 12  
none	 taliesin total of 12  matt does not hit hes ready for you and the shield catches your blade it sticks into it for a  second and shoves it off with you  taliesin thats everything well i could move but no im going to stay locked with  this one then no im done  matt i forgot to attack with that other ogre last turn but thats okay he was slowed its fine  now the ogres go this one is going to continue to pummel you as now youve pummeled it so it gets  two 
none	 strikes against you  taliesin im going to use disadvantage  marisha oh thank you  taliesin youre welcome  matt thats going to put him at a nine so the first strike misses are you going full amplified  the second strike also has disadvantage  travis what is that called  sam full amplify  matt thats going to be a 15  marisha whoa miss  matt both swings go wide as its eyes suddenly are filled with blackened blood and it cant see  where you are it hits the side of the tree and the 
none	 tree actually tumbles over onto the ground there  marisha firewood  matt the other ogre whos now in front of yasha as you approached it its caught off guard  smash scary thing its going to take two strikes towards you  taliesin isnt it still slowed  matt yeah it was one action as multiattack  taliesin oh its two okay  matt thats going to be a 14 whats your armor class  ashley 14  laura whoa we need to get you some ac  matt thats going to be a 13 second one misses but 
none	 the first one does hit that is 17 points of  bludgeoning damage halved to eight its still grunting its like its trying to push through  molasses every time it strikes or swings at you its going to attempt to shift around not even  noticing fjord there at the moment around this way fjord you do get an attack of opportunity  against it  travis i do amazing that is 26 to hit  matt that hits roll damage  travis is this considered a monstrosity or a beast  matt it is not it is considered 
none	 technically a giant  travis gotcha 13 points of damage  matt nice that finishes your reaction on that ogres turn is done nott youre up  sam okay ill hold up the hand crossbow point it in yashas general vicinity and say ill  finish the job sister i will fire at the ogre  matt okay  sam oh no only a 13 oh wait no it went up 14  matt that hits ogre is a big target  sam yeah i think i get all the sneak attack  matt you do  sam ugh
