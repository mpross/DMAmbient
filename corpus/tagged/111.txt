none	 and bring us down  back into tonights episode of critical role  spooky ethereal music  heavy breathing  roaring  dramatic music  gun firing  welcome back  so last we left off the party having found  their way back to the city of westruun  which had been overrun by the herd of  roving nomadic tribal barbarians and other such brigands  that wander the landscape of talâ€™dorei  that grog once belonged to  had swooped in and taken westruun  after the chroma conclave dragon attack  across this countryside  the 
town	 party had devised a plan to find their way into the town  or at least one of them would  distract a cluster of these individuals these goliaths  many of which are you know halfgiant goliaths  pulling them out of the city into a large pit  that had been hidden after being carved  by the druid keyleth  scanlan went into be the distraction  becoming invisible leaping to the center  of the main town square  right in front of the margraves house  where apparently the leader of this clan kevdak  
none	 which has a long history with grog resides  as part of this distraction scanlan released a thunderwave  and in doing so unknowingly also revealed himself  as the invisibility spell went away  and an entire cluster of very angrylooking  individuals bared down on him  managed to escape thanks to dimension door  twice and made your way into the  partially ruined temple of arathis  where you came face to face with a number of  refugee westruun villagers and  dr dranzel and kaylee  and that is where we left off so 
none	  after appearing and having a moment of realizing  the scenario you see a handful of people  most of them filthy completely beleaguered  and in need of not being in this circumstance  as long as they possibly can  and you can see kaylee kinda holding them back defensively  and dranzel having just noticed your appearance  and calling out to you with a chuckle  realizing that youre here and  kaylee rolling her eyes apparently unable to really escape  through fate though there is a look a brief glance of  appreciation 
none	 that at least youre not  burnt to a crisp somewhere outside emon  but dranzel walks up to you and is like  as hush as he can be  scanlan so glad to see that you survived  what are you doing here  scanlan well  doctor  there will be plenty of time for  for festive reunions and  hopefully tearful hellos but right now  im afraid we have a bit of problem  see my friends are stationed outside the main gate  lying in wait for these goliaths  that are terrorizing 
town	 the town  my mission was to come in here and  somehow convince the goliaths to leave through the main gate  and my mission is not complete and im afraid  well ive roused them and theyre  going to come in here and kill us all  unless i get them out through the main gate  so were in a bit of a time crunch  hi  and doctor doctor you are  such a long friend of mine and a trusted companion  but im afraid though i love you i uh  you 
none	 cannot help me  i need kaylees help in this  at which point dranzel  whose face has fallen into a look of  absolute fear and despair to confusion  to mild frustration  continues still glaring in your face goes  well i guess some things dont change over time  you son of a bitch  laughing  okay well kaylee  and he looks over his shoulder and  kaylee kinda steps up now and brushes off her shoulder  all right so what kind of business  am i getting you out of now 
none	 father  well not just not just getting me out of  im afraid im afraid well all die if you dont help  kaylee great great thats fantastic  im sorry  youve just banished all of these  fine folks to their demise  do you feel good  no no i havent not if you help so  listen ive been thinking a lot about you  and its so wonderful to see you and  i just need you to trust me in this and  and lend me your talents and your magic if you 
town	 can  will you trust me today  doesnt seem like i really have much of a choice  at which point you hear in the outside footfalls  heavy footfalls going in the street  on the outside of the temple and you hear some  shouting muffled in the distance  muffled shouting  mimics heavy footsteps  everyone kinda stays really still and silent  and then you  hear a few more footsteps  mimics footsteps  mimics loud crash  on a partially broken door of the temple  some heavy hand falls hit and 
none	 everyone just kinda  ducks down and the air leaves the room entirely  at which point theres a moment of pause  and the door begins to push open against all the rocks  and this barricade thats been placed against the door  slides against the ground opens ever so slightly  quiet still stands and you see these fingers come through  and pull it and another voice say  hey give me a hand here this ones barricaded  the door slides a couple more inches  and you see an arm come through  now 
none	 holding against the side of the room  another arm comes out  shit  can i grab kaylee and get everyone to  is there anywhere to hide in this room  any place in the back  well its a partially collapsed like  halfceiling area thats part of the  temple on the second floor  there is an area beneath the spiral staircase  that leads to the second floor  that can fit most of the people there  okay  im going to very quickly and with her help  usher everybody back into 
none	 this back stair  matthew okay  turn around blow my horn of fog  to fill the room partially with smoke  matthew okay  and then im going to tell kaylee  can you throw your voice  after that  mimics horn  just fills with this heavy heavy mist  obscuring the vision of most everyone in the room  that isnt directly at your side  you hear the voice at the door go  hey whats that coming out here  and then now fighting heavily against the door  and its slamming against 
none	 the barricade  mimics banging and slamming  kaylee kind of getting a feel for whats happening  all right what can i do  you can throw your voice ive seen you do it once right  kaylee i can i can  can you change your voice  i can  okay  can you be  the scariest fucking voice youve ever done  in your entire life  i will tell you what to say ill whisper it to you  you just be the voice i will be the visuals all right  im gonna

none	  it is a very very simple illusion  sam for sure  as far as i know it cant even really move  sam yeah  it can be an image  yeah thats fine  its gonna be floating amongst fog  okay so within this fog  you see as they push through the door  the barricade clatters down  a section of a table and a chair and  a lot of the rubble that was kinda scooped  up from the roof that had caved in  jammed against this door gets skirted back 
none	  tumbles and clatters across the stone work  and you see one goliath  and one kind of roughlooking human  with a ragged beard come rushing in  you know dual hand axes drawn  and looking about the fog as suddenly  out of the middle of this space  a giant semitranslucent disembodied head  of what you recall is a laughs stonejaw strongjaw  laughing  marisha wilson  wilson  standing there leaning forward at a large  though you know  i will say though initially what is your dc on this  
none	 its through the hand cone  so its 20  okay  taliesin oh wow  they both stop and just kinda go  uh  laughing  are you seeing what im seeing  the humans like  yeah  and theres just a moment of pause there  and kaylees looking at you like  okay really quick heres your motivation  youre a dead goliath  you were killed in combat by one of your own  and you probably sound really scary and fucked up  ready go  okay i tell her i am stonejaw 
none	 strongjaw  she puts her hands together and  clasps almost like the grass reeds that you blow into  but as she speaks into her hand  it sends out these rippling kind of  almost like a heat distortion  that kind of just scatters out from her hand  and outside of this central illusion  you hear a voice comes booming forward  i  sam fuck yes  am stonejaw strongjaw  returned from the realm of the dead  yes yes yes thats good  keep going keep going youre doing great  i 
none	 love you  okay uh  laughing  kevdaks son zanror killed me in dishonorable combat  laughing  kevdaks son zanror killed me  in dishonorable combat  i cant go to the other side  until i have avenged my death  i cannot move on to the other side  until ive avenged my death  laughing  growling  the goliath goes sorry then  laughing  as he steps out of the room  the guy with the straggled beard who  you gather is of a different type  of a tribal background than 
none	 the goliaths  just kind of gleans an eye untrustingly  yeah strongjaw you say  how strong is that jaw of yours  and throws an ax towards it  it just passes through and clatters behind  okay  quick say you idiot i am but a projection  you idiot  laughing  i am but a projection  the real stonejaw is currently outside the main gate  waiting for a battle of revenge against zanror  send him now  marisha thats a lot sam i know  sorry kaylee  the real zanror stands 
none	 outside this city gate waiting  for vengeance against zanror  youre doing great youre doing great  bring him now or you all shall suffer  that last part was improv  that was amazing kaylee  laughing  grunting  theres like a slight pause  can i have my axe back  i motion to dr dra to throw it back to him  he runs over feels for it looks around  sam throw it hard  i will throw it hard  no no dont say that part dont say that part  laughing  
none	 its fine youre doing great  he starts backing up towards the door  at which point the ax just clatters past him  slams into the door behind him  he reaches up without looking and he grabs it  thank you  the main gate the main gate  the main gate  sam wow  theres like four gates into the city  which main gate  i dont know do i know what it looks like  matt the western one  the western gate the western gate  the western gate  laughing  right

none	 people out of here  things have gone a bit up  how are we gonna get the rest of these folks out  and dranzel thinks for a second he goes  well we cant wait for the rest of the team  theyre probably still on their way back from kymal  ive unfortunately mostly spent  my capabilities for the day  scanlan what do you got  to keep us all safe  no to get the rest of these poor saps out  out of the city  jesus uh  were you gonna leave

town	 minutes and we all stay out of sight  now the rest of you guys are currently waiting  on the outskirts of the western side of town  you hear the bells going off in the distance  you hear the  the sound of shouts as the guards that were at that post  start stepping back inward  trying to figure out whats going on  at this distance its hard to make out  exactly what conversation is happening  but the energy of the outside of the city  has definitely climbed up a few 
none	 paces  which leads you to believe  hopefully this means scanlans done his job  we shall find out  is there any other preparation  you guys wanna go through right now  or are you just waiting to see any sign of movement  are we all like together  or are we spread out across everything  were birds  laura youre birds  marisha were birds on a wall  were standing together in like the tall grass  thats right  okay  laura were with everybody else  im gonna take a minute

dung	 rock just breaks  laughing  no  he vanishes screaming into the pit below  as you step forward and look over  what little glint of daylight even makes the bottom area  cause its far out of your range for dark vision  you just see enough of a movement on the bottom  and then no movement whatsoever  taliesin you wile e coyoted that guy  oh man  grog you all right down there  laughing  no answer  yay  yay  liam and scene  youve made it  im looking 
town	 for scanlan too by the way  kind of keeping an eye out for scanlan  perception check  uh 23  23 okay  the second time  as youre glancing through you see no sign of scanlan  you do see now that  there are small groups of these clan individuals  are now pulling out of homes various denizens of westruun  and pulling them towards the center of town  theyre screaming and kicking you know  or some of them just arent putting up a fight  because they have no way to  
town	 and theyre just pulling them almost like shields  to the center of town  it seems like they  marisha have a plan matthew have a plan  taliesin shit  i dont know that  i haul ass back  heading back  do i see them do i see the group  weve cleared the area more or less yeah  matt i mean the area where they are as you glance back  yeah there doesnt appear to be any current set  whoever was set to go to that side  of the gate to

none	 out  marisha im looking for scanlan  on my way back by the way  yeah  you are currently hunkered down with  kaylee dr dranzel and this cluster of nine survivors  youve managed to parry off one incursion  of these herd members within the temple  the barricaded door is still slightly ajar  as closing it would make quite a bit of noise  sam mmhmm  what are you planning to do  sighs  i mean i have to get these people  out of the city i guess  so they 
none	 know the location of the  entrance to the sewers correct  kaylee had said that she knew yeah  all right well then im just going to  shit  do i know that the goliaths were  working with orcs at all or  was it just goliaths is it  well no  from what youve heard from when  when grog was interrogating the first member  of the herd that you guys found  on your way south through westruun there  it was a largely goliath herd that had  been challenged by and 
none	 then defeated another clan  and then absorbed them and the other clan  involved a lot more varying races and specialities  there were halforcs there were some  kind of wild elves that were part of the crew  and a lot of the brigand humans  it was very much kind of like just  defeated their leader took in the others  because their choice was to either die or join  sam mmhmm  and as such it has grown to this much more  mammothsized roving herd  i dont remember the name of 
none	 that herd or anything right  or what they looked like  but they were motley  and they involved halforcs and things  matthew there were a couple halforcs  there were a few humans that were like  i think you saw one wild elf and then mostly goliaths  based around the center of the margraves estate  okay  all right  uh well were  i tell the people theres nine people right  matthew yeah  plus me kaylee and doctor  uh all right well i gather the people around and i say 
none	  were going to be moving through the city rather fast  in case we are spotted i need to  hide you people or make you not  a target so im going to disguise you all  as a band of irritable halforcs  and grotesque humans and the like using seeming  and just look ornery and look mean  and if you are approached just sort of  spit and kick the dirt and look pissy  well go  make a performance check  a performance check  in showing them and guiding them  
none	 oh i can demonstrate it for them  yes with my acting abilities  laughing  okay im such a good performer  im not even gonna look  taliesin what did i roll  um well uh youre doing okay  its okay you  with your performance bonus thats a 20  okay good  laughing  you take a moment to show like  some guttural snarls teach a few odd  you know curse words in orcish  that you learned through your travels  yeah yeah yeah just some vocal warmups  you know when 
none	 you wanna get deep  growls everyone try  growls  thats good thats good thats good  work on that  you all gather up along with dranzel and kaylee  who looks kind of suspicious at what youre attempting  shes like what exactly are you trying to do here  im just trying to keep us safe  and get these people to the sewers  you know the way out of the city dont you  aye i can show you  all right  do you have weapons can you protect yourself  are you 
none	 okay  i can protect myself  dont worry scanlan  im just worried i have to worry about you  i will always be worried about you  im sorry  youll always be disappointed to find  that i can take care of myself  no i wont be disappointed at all  in fact that makes me quite happy  good can we be off then  well all right  okay as long as youre happy im happy  all right  listen im sorry its just  laughing  i never get to see you

none	  well do your trick  okay  so i cast seeming on the lot and  i make a few orcs and a few humans  any number of creatures within 30 feet of you  so all of these westruun peasant folk  yourself dr dranzel and kaylee  all of a sudden become to varying sized degrees  i can make people a foot taller  taller yeah so like they can be somewhat larger  youre still  you guys are still tiny little goblinoid halforcs  but it gives a visual perspective  based on 
none	 what youve seen of this troop  and everyone kind of looks at themselves  looking at the back of their hands  theres this one kind of younger man  in his midteens hes like this is amazing  grunts  and theyre also making the noises at each other  like for a brief moment all of the fear  subsides as theyre for the moment  getting into the play of acting like a halforc  and then they all get serious again  and look to you and kaylee and kaylee goes  all right then 
town	 follow me  sam shes so good  slinks out the door looks back and forth for a moment  leans back in  coast is clear  she nods  you see a troop of about  it would be 12 halforc looking barbarians  of varying aggressive stances  start pouring out of a broken temple and into the street  i swoop down a little closer  matthew theyre heading sam and attack us  laughing  matthew im waiting to see  tippi hedren  caw  her elemental drop  laughing  super  tails 
town	 in the hole  can i tell them its scanlan and crew  no  you have no idea  its very believable  its very believable  and you see this roving band of halforcs now  that are heading southward of the town in a cluster  marisha okay matthew theyre like  jumping from one alleyway to another  and theyre heading kind of southwest  am i like this is sporadic for a group of orcs  or am i like crazy fuckin group of orcs  make an insight check  all right  yeah

town	 street south and kaylee continues  to usher up to the edge of the alleyway  she looks back and forth  nods and you guys walk into the street again  as you step into the street a voice goes hey  and kaylee stops and whips around and  looks in that direction and you can see  a group of three individuals led by one goliath  and there is one kind of wildlooking elf  who has like facepaint strewn across  the front of their expression with this  long almost dredlocked light brown hair 
town	  and what looks to be an older human  with like streaks of black and grey  and this long long beard thats tied off near the stomach  barechested with like scars across the chest  and they all kind of loom up as the goliath steps up  pointing out we need you to the west gate  and he kind of steps up  whos your watcher  i step forward and say he was killed by that gnome  gnome whered you see it  right in the center of town  he was a 
town	 scary undead gnome and hes roaming about  kevdak sent us to search for him  make a deception check  groans  19  19  so ugly  center of town aye  well then you should probably come with us then  see if we can swarm it  if i may if i may actually  laughing  kevdak said to follow the gnome and he ran this way  im sorry we have to follow kevdaks orders  group ooooh  all right all right  yeah im sorry  laughing  taliesin please please

none	 small dump in the area  nothing food or you know refusewise  but theres definitely like this is a  a graveyard for broken furniture  but in the center there is a small  cylindrical stone protrusion and a grate on top  and kaylee runs up  quick quick help me get this open  at which point  doctor  dr dranzel comes forward and goes  let me take care of this  which is funny cause dr dranzel  looks just like himself but just all covered in  laughing  facepaint you cant 
none	 see his hat  its  hes kind of enjoying this persona for a moment  he goes spits grunts  and strains as he pulls upward straight  natural 20  cheers  does he strain  throws it aside  everyone can beat doors but us  laughing  and dont you forget it  so inside  yes go go go  and they all start climbing in  dranzel and kaylee are helping get  the peasants down inside first  at which point the one that was following you guys  turns the corner in

none	 drags him  i try to help  go go go  i dont know the ways through the sewers  you have to go lead them not me  sighs  she drops the leg down  i start dragging him  you guys start dragging him off the side  and you guys quickly go dart in  as you all jump inside dranzel grabs the grate top  he gets down behind it  right before he closes it i step out  i step out and i say take them to safety  bring them outside 
none	 the city  hide stay safe  all right  same goes for you scanlan  well ill do my best  yeah you will  and he pulls it down screws it into place  to where it feels kind of taut  and you are now on your own outside of this area  with a sleeping individual as his snoring slowly subsides  he starts rousing from his slumber about a minute later  rubbing his chin  what do you do  while he was still asleep i was  booking it towards the western gate

none	  matthew go for it  trade up  uh thats a  ill say before you commit ill say this has disadvantage  because it went from flying at a smooth pace  to plummeting and you have to quickly  taliesin i had to reload in the middle so like  yeah  im like skeet shooting here  matthew yeah  ugh  thats a im gonna miss  thats like a 5 to hit so that  thats 12  12 just hits  gasps  giant eagle ac is not that great man  thats 
none	 so sad  oh god i feel bad now  laughing  laura 12  matthew giant eagle doesnt have a crazy ac  that oh man i really feel  matthew its more of a travel form  its not meant for  fighting  you know main fighting  the one that was going for you is  just cause you were the one that was nearest to it  it wasnt expecting a hail of arrows in its face  29 points of damage  and with that you see it falls an eagle  and then 
town	 wooshing noise into a person it falls  laughing  and disappear behind the skyline  of the building of westruun that  block your view of the center of town  well they dont know whos coming at least  ashley are we close enough to loot that first body  sure you guys  marisha well i was headed that way  ashley were headed that way  you guys then  taliesin im staying on the roof  moving around the chasm you create you head  inside the western gate of westruun at this point  
none	 marisha hang on wait well  oh im headed to the body still  its inside the gate  yeah  yeah it fell inside the gate of the city  you approach and its a rough scene  fell on like the head and the shoulder  the rest of the bodys kind of  laura ew  accordioned in  like the body does it appear to be  any druid related to the ashari clan  looking it over make an investigation check  taliesin figure out which end is up first  i need a really 
none	 good check  my investigations not very good  its your dad  oh  laughing  20  20  you take a quick glance over checking where any  ceremonial markings of the ashari are none  this individual appears to be more of  a primalbased druidic talent  there are tattoos pretty basic  various animal totems that are inscribed on the body  youre familiar with this form of druidic magic  its a lessrefined version of  what the ashari people learn and teach  marisha gotcha  but yeah theres no inclination  
none	 this is a member of the ashari  okay  so is there anything good on her  there is a  a soaked set of leather armor  chuckles  travis soaked in what marisha nonmagical  nonmagical from what you can gather  sam pee  and what looks to be a shattered quarterstaff  that may have been landed on  groans  beyond that youre gonna have to get  sifting through the remains  its not gonna be a fun experience  for what little you may gather  ill let it go  liam 
none	 you gonna start harvesting  ill let it go  laughing  matthew start harvesting  travis she made her choice  laughing  well im gonna start rooftopping towards the center  if i see anything interesting going on in the city  i wanna stop and investigate  ditto  sneaking from rooftop to rooftop  if i can can i do a bit of  im gonna do that for sure  can i use acrobatics  you this more of a this isnt acrobatics  this is more of a jump  because there are large 
town	 large city street gaps  that are like 25 to 30 feet  marisha what about parkouring  but if i can parkour it i can find  i wanna be able to  parkour parkour  i wanna try and be smart about it  and find it any way i can make it  right make an acrobatics check  taliesin an acrobatics check  thank you  sam amateur spiderman  laura can i join in  i was gonna join in  up there  matthew do you want to get off your broom and do 
town	 that  that was the thing yeah i was gonna  fly up on the broom and land on the roofs and then  matthew gotcha  yeah so you go ahead and you get up with him  and you can go  the two of you can start like parkouring off the rooftop  liam theres a mechanical engineer on the roof  laughing  23  matthew 23  sam screams  you guys make it a couple of streets before  you reach a point where this block does  cause the main street intersects  
town	 with another main street that goes southward  and the gap is about 30 feet to jump across  and you know from experience that  you couldnt do that with a regular jump  ive got an idea  if you give me the broom ill just hold on  and plant me down if we see anything  well just keep low by the roof  laughing  laura cant you just sit on the broom with me  what is going on are grog and pike and i  just supposed to stand over here by the 
none	 gate  are you guys gonna head off  marisha we have a plan  i thought we were going in  were heading into the city  laura i thought we were all going in  i mean we had a plan and then  we didnt have a plan so we have like  liam were going seven different directions  you look up as you see suddenly glance overhead  a shadow from one rooftop to another  make a perception check  uh 18  taliesin its batman  18  you glance up and you 
none	 see the  dangling kicking feet of percy  underneath a broom that just wooshing noise  across the top of that  all right  i didnt know there was room on there  theyre traveling yes  yeah theyre traveling back inward to the city  all right  well thats good  i cant i probably cant catch up  im just gonna keep hoofing it  laura wait but the earrings  oh wait i can hear yes yes  ooh  laughing  thank you i forgot about that  uh yeah  hey hi 
town	 oi guys oi oi  laura scanlan  sam oi oi  sam hows it going  did my plan work  marisha i dont know did your plan work  taliesin what was your plan  my plan was to send all the goliaths  all of them out through the main gate  did they all come through the main gate  no  no definitely not  liam if there was only six it worked  marisha scanlan it appears they are  doubling down in the center of the town  do you have any idea 
none	 on why they would be doing this  well i dont know theyre very perceptive  i may have alerted all of them to our presence  marisha oh fantastic sam but  it was a distraction marisha sure  and in a sense that was my mission so  taliesin a distraction from what  laura you know what we killed nine of them  marisha a distraction from  their terrible terrible lives  travis good job scanlan mission accomplished  yes thank you thank you  ashley hey scanlan im glad youre okay  oh thanks is 
none	 that pike  ashley yeah  oh hi pike  ashley hi  oh hows it going out there  oh its good its good  can we do this  okay okay okay  what should i do where should i go who should i kill  liam stay put and let us come to you  what do you see around you  marisha yeah where are you  sam idiots on broomsticks flying around  laura oh shit thats us  all right  can we all convene in an alley  you do  you convene 
town	 in an alley  within the next few minutes a little bit of a  confusing telephone bit going back and forth  but you do eventually gather  at this time you guys do hear  what sounds like some voices shouting  about a block and a half up the way  laura shit  marisha okay  travis are there buildings  sam are we all together now  laura yeah matthew yeah  by the way hi hi this is me  laura oh my god you dont even look like yourself  i look pretty 
none	 cool  travis its so good to see you  we should get inside for a moment  we should  is there a wine cellar or door or something  that we can beat in or a window  there are windows you dont see a wine cellar  in the immediate vicinity of this alleyway  liam ill get it open quietly im not gonna break anything  travis can i look in the window first  yeah you go ahead and glance in  make a perception check  i see nothing its a 2  matthew 
dung	 it is very dark  theres no light inside and  laura what about our darkvision  can we see anything in there  no  even if your darkvision you guys see as well  theres nothing inside  the building appears to be vacant  liam is it locked  the window is locked  very minor lock  well i just rolled a natural 20 so  laura you wasted it on a window  matthew that was the most deft unlocking youve ever done  liam i hit it like fonzie  yeah  laughing  
town	 we pop in the window  great  you guys all crawl inside of the room and  looking inside you do notice that the  some of the furniture is kind of tipped over  the front door actually that leads  out to the main road the southfacing road  the knob is broken off like someone just kicked the door in  and it looks like there were signs of a minor struggle  but theres no bloodshed from what you can see  most of if any belongings that  had any value have been taken 
none	  the place looks stripped of anything metallic  it looks like its been pretty heavily  ransacked inside here  marisha grog travis yeah  they were dragging everyone out of every available door  and dragging them to the city the center of the city  why  travis people shields  meat shields  meat shields  travis yeah marisha right  okay  so we go to them and if we get too close  they slit all their throats  its like basic goliath logic  laura lovely  liam so is maybe the oneonone 
none	 combat  our only option at the moment  do we have any other option  how many were there total  we dont know how many  probably 30 to 40 now  sam oh okay  probably down to 20 or 30  well  wait there was 30 or 40 to start  and we killed nine of them  remember he said we were down to like 50  we killed like nineish  sam oh so 40ish  so two left  laura six left grog then six  travis yeah its like a thousand 
town	  laughing  taliesin lets  marisha okay  all right  sam ive got a plan  i go to the center of town  yeah  i create a distraction  laughing  laura seriously  thats pretty much all my plans are always  travis what time is it  matthew right now youre pushing early afternoon  its probably id say the equivalent of about 1 130  laura jeez travis perfect  last question i have  do we know where wilhands residence used to be  matthew you do you would know very well 
town	  its outside of town  matthew you spent a lot of your time  outside or inside  its inside the town but its a  little bit northwest of the center area  so its closer to where a lot of the  temples and the worship areas are  and there is a small park there that was across the way  liam that may be something useful  its a red brick building  it stands out against a lot of it  because it was built specifically  to kind of be the small gnomish 
town	 hovel  that was built buy his own hands  so when attacking right once youve  given up your position it loses its worth  so my suggestion would be that we move  to approach from another vantage point or  we can just kick this thing off and i walk in  im fine either way  marisha all right well  are we nearby a sewer system  scanlan do you know  oh i happen to know exactly where a sewer system is  we can try and sewer cross town  or we can 
town	 just walk right in  sam where are we trying to get  laura to the center of town  travis we thought about seeing if maybe  we could get to wilhands house  sam where is that and why would we be there  well thats pikes grandfather  so i know but does that provide us  with some strategic advantage  no but we might be able to see if hes all right  theyve probably dragged him to the center of town  how can we get through this  go ahead pike  we 
town	 could go to the center of town  and check to see if hes there  after we take care of business  and then hopefully hes not there  i mean he could provide a lot of help  laura maybe we go to his house first  hes your grandfather  travis if we go to the center of town   laura its all going down  travis yeah  marisha how do we get out of this with the most   or sorry with the least civilian casualties grog  travis im not really thinking 
dung	 that far ahead  marisha sure  we were supposed to also pick something up  yes a twostory  laura we can do that after  taliesin heres the thing sam well wait  the thing might help us who knows  it was a red brick twostory home  sam near the fountain  dark wood  wait  near the fountain crossroads  taliesin pike do you know this house  doesnt that sound like the house that  thats wilhands house  wilhands house is on the  in the temple district stands out  because 
dung	 its a small little like red brick area  the one that hes talking about is more of  a classic kind of dark wood with red brick outside  like the way he described it was  its very colonialstyle but like with  a brick base built around it  is that not the leader of  the guy that runs the westruun  that was master qualls house  master quall  master quall was just the master  hes his own little  travis thats not that house  no  the margraves house is the 
town	 one thats in the town square  and thats where kevdak apparently has  taken as his homestead  right and thats not the description  so we have to start this now are we prepared  there are pluses and minuses to both thoughts  they have a bunch of innocent people  who they may just start killing  heres my question  if we wait will they ever theoretically let them go  or is it easier to just slit their throats  travis no  then we shouldnt wait  taliesin we shouldnt wait  we 
none	 shouldnt wait  then we just do it  those of us with distance we make  we find positions around the square  laura we stealth around  the second we start attacking  they will start killing so  he walks in on his own challenges kevdak to a duel  yeah look  on your own  so itll go like this  everybody get high vantage points  so i walk in im pretty sure if i call him out  hell step aside and well do this thing  if it starts going poorly i 
none	 leave it to your discretion  or if other people start getting iffy  with the civilians we can start taking shots  i know i can drop a few before they do anything  ive burned both of my wild  shaping abilities for right now  unless we wanted to take  a brief rest to regain our thoughts  this is sort of a brief rest  is this considered like a short rest  no a short rest is like a half an hour  to an hour of like intentional  we can afford it 
none	 we can take that  marisha a half hour  will they start killing people  taliesin not in half an hour  travis no they wont do it for no reason  they dont even know where we are  marisha yeah 30 minutes is nothing in a hostage situation  travis take a short rest if you want to  all right lets take a short rest  and well finish fleshing out this plan  matthew okay  marisha does anyone else need to heal up  taliesin im good  marisha i wanna burn a hit 
town	 dice  laura i am too  laura i dont want you to waste any spells  save it  i can use a hit die  the margrave house when they were  flying over in mist form there was something  that looked like it was red and  smeared on the outside of the walls  was that the margrave house  yeah  sam are we close to the edge of town  about like a five six minute walk  a brisk jog i should say  its close but its not like right outside 
none	  sam okay  taliesin thats what i would say is my plan  if you feel like walking  we can point guard you from a distance  and make sure if anyone tries to attack  marisha well we should try and probably  have a few people on civilian duty as well  kind of like we did before  taliesin yes  that would be perfect if youre willing to  no thats that cant  you dont still have the house that you can summon do you  of course i do  can we 
none	 put that door somewhere and start  sending people if we liberate them to it  of course we can  however it would have to be somewhere  close to where the hostages are  they would definitely see their hostages  jumping into a magical hole  we could put your magical hole inside of a building  and send people into the building  so that its got like double cover  and if anyone finds your magical hole  they can jump in it or do they have to have permission  by the way so 
none	 many jokes so many jokes  laughing  resisting  youre being very good  very firm on this one  what happens if you lure a goliath and orc  into the magical hole do they get stuck in there  i imagine theyll have a lovely chicken dinner  yeah cause after 24 hours they get kicked out  laura they can leave when they want  they can come and go as they please  so its not like a roach motel  no  vex can capture one of them  laura i can  sighs 
town	  taliesin thats good to know  marisha okay  if we know the city this well how far would you say  is wilhands place from where we are now  id say its about  travis mile and a half  yeah about a 20 25 minute walk north  from where you are right now  its a little ways  a little ways west of nojas old store and  yeah its about 25 minutes  would you like to go first and see if hes there  ashley its choosing between the people in town 
none	 or  taliesin you dont have to  you can send a couple of us to go check in  i grab the stone  go check come back  sam wait  im sorry but we need pike with us  taliesin she can go check  and shell be back within 60 seconds  she has to get there shes the worst at stealth  thats very fair  but we can send someone and have them right back  i mean its not  what if she what if we go there and we find him  
none	 and then what you can pop back but hes alone  you cant pop two people back with the stone  ill go  i can pop us back  we can send him back and then i can get back on my own  you dont know where youre going  pike can you tell me how to get there  yes  ive walked city streets that ive never been in before  we can start getting into our positions  and then when youre done you can join one of us  whats gonna be the benefit 
town	 of finding him  before the fight as opposed to after  thats fair  well unless theyre holding him  unless theyre holding him  but they wouldnt be holding him  because they dont expect us  they dont know its us thats coming  well then hes either safe in his house  or hes in the middle of the town square  either of which  she has a fair point  travis im good either way  were okay  well so if we cut off the head  of the snake theres no issue 
town	  sighs  lets do it lets go towards  and he is a very powerful cleric if we do find him  so it would be nice to have some extra help  he may already be there  and if hes i feel like we should go town  because thats a lot more people than one person  is his house near where were going or no  travis no  its a wide arc you have to go up and over  to get to the center of town  the center of towns not like 
town	 right center  its kind of like north center  i mean i could mist there and i could  do something to get there faster  no were gonna need  travis you dont need to  ashley we need your spells  yeah dont waste your spells  look lets just face this wish each other good luck  and well meet in the middle  are we going to flank the entire city center  were going to make this its a town square if i recall  theres like a theyve got a barricade  correct 
town	 me if im wrong  theyve got a section of the city  of the town barricaded off  well its not so much a barricade  more than they have short little barricades  built in for like anticavalry  and for any large like siege attempts or  so we can slowly we can start to surround it  we can be stealthy and singular we can keep in contact  i can use earth elemental to glide and literally  pop out right in the center of town and avoid everything  you could walk right in 
none	  but you dont want them to see you  i would be underground  yeah i just plan to walk right in  and grog when you fight this person  if he agrees to this oneonone combat  is it gonna be fists or a sword  i have no idea  laughing  grog i guess my one concern is  whats stopping them from slitting  all of these peoples throats at any drop of a second  a warriors honor  a warriors honor  thats weird but good enough for me  and do 
none	 you think you can evoke that  i guarantee it  mens warehouse  laughing  just crazy enough for it to work  ashley youre gonna like the way you look  i guarantee it  laughing  okay  i leave it up to your artistic influences  on where you go from here  dont be afraid to call your friends if you need help  if im earth elemental i wont be able  to speak so ill be relying on you  youll be hearing on me  ill be hearing on you  marisha 
none	 im gonna go  im gonna stay with grog  okay  are you guys bee lining it like straight through  no i was gonna say  matthew or are you like arcing past nojas place  or are you going  yeah  matthew whats your plan  are we going for the element of surprise  would it be better for me to earth elemental  and blast out in the middle or would it be  better for me to flank with the rest of you  its gonna go south if kevdak  sees any 
none	 of us pop out of the windows  i think that grogs right he needs to go in alone  we need to be hidden  we need to flank and be completely stealthy  okay  and if shit goes south then we go in  okay  is there anything we can give grog to help him  sam cant you bless him or something  travis i do have a question  matthew yeah  i can enhance his ability  travis nah never mind  are you attuned out maybe  marisha what were you gonna 
none	 say  yeah i was gonna see if i should switch out  the gauntlets of ogre strength for these braces of defense  that give me 2 to my ac but if i wear that  then it takes out my natural armor  what about  no its not considered armor  not actually wearing armor its designed  for somebody who does not so  liam grog laura well thats good  grog  what if i lend you my boots  which when you put your heels together  will also help your armor out a 
none	 bit  or help your chances of being hit  helps me attack faster  you can give them back to me tomorrow  and i can give you enhanced constitution  no  no  ive learned that my strength is with my friends  and my friends have their own strengths  to each their own  i dont want you all handicapping yourself for me  i would like to change out  my braces of defense to get a 2 to my ac  for the gauntlets of ogre strength  okay  so your strength 
dung	 is now a 17  you take a 2  travis the ac goes to 21  matthew correct  okay  because it goes to 17 my modifier is 3  would you like some extra strength for your  yes remember grog that mine and scanlans strengths  are in helping the rest of our  friends and our fellow allies  so we can grant you enhanced abilities  do you have to do it now  i would much rather you just did it on your own  and maybe not tell me about it  
none	 marisha well i could do it ahead of time  just do it  liam ixnay on the elphay  just hug him  just hug him  taliesin i push her towards him  give him a hug for good luck  marisha grog  oh shit what is this  marisha grog travis hello  we believe in you  travis yep  and i cast enhanced ability and i give him enhanced  or i could get him like  im gonna give him bears endurance  which gives him advantage on constitution checks  and he 
none	 gains an additional 2d6 temporary hit points  okay  go ahead and roll 2d6  me  matthew yep  big money no whammies  thats not great 6  you have 6 temporary hit points  and you have advantage on constitution checks  advantage on constitution  matthew not saving throws  constitution checks  checks okay  matthew there are no skills that are constitutionbased  would it have been better to do strength  matthew when he rages he gets  advantage on strength anyway  oh he already gets advantage on strength  okay 
none	  hell be okay  matthew but you know if it comes up  well now that were done being all touchyfeely  or whatever the hell that was  sam well wait wait wait  oh jesus  so wait sorry its just i found this old joke book  i thought you might wanna hear this joke  and i pull out my  laughing  bull strength scroll  oh thank god  and im gonna read him the bull strength scroll  can i affect him with the 5 strength  well the bull strength as 
none	 an ability  just gives him advantage on strength which he already has  oh  i thought it was a 5 to strength no  you mustve pulled those stats  out of the old pathfinder game  oh  i have had this for a long time  well then in that case ill just  ill sing you a rousing song to put you on your way  clears throat  â™« the stars at night  â™« are big and bright  clapping  â™« deep in the beard of strongjaw â™«  laughing  take

none	 that  theres a blast of warm light across your chest  that fades as she has already turned around  however vex grog and scanlan you guys  your maximum hit points are increased by 15  and you get those 15 extra hit points  for the next eight hours  sam great laura nice  not concentration  anything else you want to cast  no  matthew no  okay  i tap grog on the shoulder and i flash him  laughing  go get it soldier  travis i cant lose  sam wait

town	 can stealth  all right  so the rest of you go ahead and make your stealth check  marisha ooh  matthew which direction are you  traveling grog by the way  i guess just towards the heart of town  just beelining it straight to the center  grog not stopping  okay  all righty  so stealth  ashley 14  sam oh my god matthew with the ten  whats that  matthew plus ten  oh  then 24  sam thank god laura what  laura 29 liam 39  marisha 33 
none	 taliesin 34  21  all right  grog is not going stealthy or are you just walking through  travis just walking through  all right  taliesin hums exciting music  matthew as you guys follow suit dodging from alley to alley  grog you step into the main roadway  okay you want rooftop  you and percy  laura percy are you going to the rooftop  all right both of you guys roll acrobatics checks  well just say as a continuation of this  natural one  ashley no that was a seven  
town	 was it  yeah  no i think it was a one  laughing  matthew nice try  that thing was so  laughing  laura it might have been a seven but i thought it was a one  well regardless you guys get but 30 feet before  thud  laughing  vex you suffer eight points of damage  as you plummet off  laura come on matthew of this  the secondstory buildings and land  i have a broom to get up to the top you know  i know and unfortunately your foot 
none	  found one of those loose shingles  and you lost your grip  on the broom tumbled landed  at which your broom then thud  about two feet in front of you on the ground  i caught it  i didnt want it to  sam you are the shadow that stalks the guilty  laughing  matthew so you kind of look over  your shoulder for a second  keep marching forward  you get about four blocks before you see  a group of four individuals no goliaths among them  it appears to 
none	 be two humans a male and a female  and one elf and one halfling  theyre all smeared and muddy streaks across the face  the halfling has their head completely shaved off  and it has the two kind of lined scars  over the top of the face to the back of the head  they all turn the corner and look over at you  take a moment to kind of look for any sort of recognition  they look at each other and begin  to walk forward drawing their weapons  oh lads lads 
none	 no need for that  ive traveled quite a long way  see im part of a ranging party for kevdak  its very important that i see him  you see were family  now you can either take me to him  or i can drag you to him  the elf kind of steps forward and pushes the others away  draws these two thin short swords from the side  they look kind of jagged and chipped  like theyve seen quite a few battles  leans forward and kind of puts one eye on you 
none	  leaning on the side as he approaches  kevdak you say  family you say  ive not seen your face  nor the travels youve had with the herd  but you say family  dont make me repeat myself  make a persuasion check  gasps  natural 20  laughing  the others behind draw their weapons  one of them pulls out this like  long nasty doubleheaded great ax  and kind of lets it down to the side  and begins to step forward  the halfling draws this gnarled spiked whip  
none	 then kind of like cracks it on the ground  begins stepping forward  the female to the left of the elf  goes ahead and draws this long thin rapier  that almost has like a curve to it  and begins to point it forward  as the elf takes the two blades and  puts it out and stops the rest of them  he goes all right family of kevdak  if youre lying itll be fun to watch you scream  as he tears the head from you  walk to the front  lead 
none	 the way  walk to the front  and i walk past them to the front  all right  the four of them flank behind you  blades still drawn and just slowly walk  about ten feet to your  now i ask you as i was approaching this city  i saw a dragon fly over  picked up one who looked just like me and flew away  whats it like being the bitch of a dragon  theres a long pause as you keep walking  and the same elven voice pipes up and goes 
none	  well i imagine the gnashing teeth  of such a beast would be comparably painful  as the gnashing tips of these blades  if you dont shut your mouth goliath scum  youll be feeling the tips of those  before i feel the tips of any teeth of dragons  laughing  oh theres many a teeth waiting for you  where you walk friend  keep going  your insolence amuses me  as you guys are kind of keeping back  i need everyone to make another stealth check  liam that guy tortures small 
none	 animals by the way  taliesin natural 20  oh 21  24  39  12  plus 10  yeah  sam ooh thats our girl  37  all right  as you guys are stalking behind  theres a moment where you all  duck into one of the alleyways  and as pike spins into the alley  the edge of her shoulder armor  being wider than her actual form  catches the edge of the building  causing this large clang sound  the sound of bending metal clanging against itself  at 
none	 which point the troop behind  grog immediately spins around  did you hear that  is anyone following us  and as youve kind of kept walking forward  you feel the point of a blade just kind of  gently press into your lower back  good lord youre awful jumpy  see when i was last with this herd  the mates that i ran around with  werent so quick to jump and hide  behind their mothers skirts  keep your attention focused on me son  weve got important dealings to meet with  
none	 keep walking  the blade pulls back  as you continue to step forward  you hear a little whisper behind you  and you kind of glance over and look  as the halfling and the female  with the kind of hooked rapier  both break off and begin heading  back towards the alleyway  laura perfect  sam no problem  so as you guys step forward  you guys now lurking in the alley  kind of pull off into the shadow  listening you hear very very light footsteps  beginning to find their 
none	 way in your direction  can we wait until they come around the corner  im gonna continue  im gonna continue following grog just  are we gonna wait and jump them  or do you want me to stop them  were all split right  you guys are all  are you guys divided into different groups  sam no were all together  youre on a roof youre on a  no im not on a roof i fell off the roof  im on a roof  matthew yeah percys up on a roof

none	 two of them  two of them yes  taliesin two of them taking a turn  matthew ive described them yeah  i prep a hold person spell  ready for when they turn the corner  matthew all right  now  at this point you now see the halfling  kind of darts around whip out on the side  as the elf turns around the corner  rapier out with her hand in front of her  what are you guys doing  i wanna grab the elf and slit her throat  laughing  im 
none	 shooting at the halfling  two arrows at the halfling  matthew okay  i go for you said you were taking the elf  liam yeah  im gonna go for the elf and cast hold person  okay  uh well say for the sake of you two  you both roll initiative  14  14  matthew okay  you go ahead and make your attack first  okay  this is a surprise round  they dont expect to see you dart  out of the side of the shadows  theyre facing downward into

none	 tensing against your body  seeing that ill switch my spell to the halfling  laughing  not necessary on the elf anymore  liam do i still have the bonus action left  matthew id say so  yeah i wanna shove that in her chest  matthew okay  oh jesus  uh that is 27  matthew that hits  and that is eight  matthew eight damage  plus all that poison to it dc 15  with a seven no  okay so she takes  an additional  12 points of poison damage  
none	 with that the blade pulses as  the poison filters into the bloodstream  through the sternum where the blade pierced  as you quietly hold her in place  she goes still and goes  yeah goes limp in your arms  you however at this point turn  and cast hold person on the halfling  yeah  the halfling sees you jump out  and just whisks her out of the alleyway  turns in that direction and before  it has a chance to react as it pulls back  with the whip to go in 
none	 that direction  noise  it just stays there frozen in place  thats when i release my arrows  matthew go for it  marisha go go  matthew you have advantage on these shots  because the entity currently cannot   eight no 28 for the first hit  28 for the first hit  are you going like right up against it  or is this from a distance  this is from a distance  okay  so that hits  uh 29 for the second hit  both of those hit  and i 
none	 want to hunters mark can i hunters mark  too late  can i hunters mark it  ill say sure  laura all right  taliesin there was a countdown  18  24 for the first hit no 22 for the first hit  matthew okay  and  god i cant add  18 for the second hit  okay  so both you know just a beat of impact  the body tenses in place and you see  a bit of red begin to drip out  of the corner of the mouth of the 
none	 halfling  however its still kind of  eyes darting around wildly trying to figure out  what the hell is happening  scanlan pike anything  can i run up and grab the whip out of her hand  laughing  matthew his  yes you can  oh his hand  his hand so sorry  no the female has been by uh  hard to see halfling with that much mud  you go over and quickly wedge the whip out of  the halflings hand no issue  alright scanlan anything  thats all i can 
none	 do right  matt its pretty quick its pretty easy  it would be like an action  what do you want to do  id like to use my mace  which ill allow because hes not defending anything  its just like a bonus action  i say go for it  advantage on the attack  ok 16  16 hits  laura nice  ashley alright alright  matt because it is a melee against a currently  paralyzed individual it is considered a critical hit  nice  18  so double the dice  
none	 and then add the bonus on top of it  23  23 nice  so as you pull the whip out with one hand  you crack the mace right into the face of the halfling  to the point where you hit and you have to kind of like  get the elbow lift to pull it free  laughter  face is kinda caving a little bit ninja scroll style  and hes kind of like twitching  still conscious  no thats awful make it unconscious  matt not yet  we have to sit through 
none	 that  ashley sorry  cannot make any of these saves for the life of itself  sam can i attack  you can now yes  i will use the myth carver  oh wow  oh my god  has this happened before  no we just got this  i dont even know what i think im going to need help  okay let me help you  this is why were here  okay roll an attack  okay  you got this  i dont know how to  use the die  okay im 
none	 gonna hold the sword and i fumble with it  hold it up again and then close my eyes  and just kinda go like this  okay so the attack gives you advantage  but the blindness gives you disadvantage  so just roll an attack  plus eight  12 plus eight  matt so you get 20 that hits  go ahead and roll damage  and its a critical hit  one d8 so its two d8 plus three  travis thats the myth carver  its one d8 plus three  matt its one d6 
none	 sonic damage which is also doubled  do i roll twice or do i just  not double this  you roll  twice you roll two d8  sam double ok  roll once and then roll d8 and d6  double that number add your bonus  its just that easy  roll a d8 and a d6  matt the sonic damage sam thats a six  okay so thats nine i double that 18  plus three  plus three is 21  matt okay 21 points of damage  as you fumble the blade and 
none	 cover your  eyes as you pull back the blade  the slight humming sound hums  the blade actually kind of vibrates in place  and as you thrust forward  it goes through like butter with a heated blade  you know you think you missed  then you open and peek through your eyes  and see that you went straight though his face  laughter  group oh shit  matt like you hit nothing  the face the skull  sam i didnt mean to ah this is  you pull it out and its 
none	 still kind of  vibrating a little bit there is no blood on the blade  the actual like the sonic vibrations of the weapon  managed to shake free any possibility  of any of the gore sticking to the weapon  oh thats sick  marisha thats so bad ass  laura thats pretty cool  at which point the spell fades  as the life force of this halfling no longer holds sway  and the body just crumples into a pile  marisha all right onward with our murdering spree lets go  wait wait are 
none	 they going to  know that their two people are gone  taliesin eventually  eventually  taliesin what other choices did we have  laura can we loot the bodies  of course you say that  before we move forward  matt you can if you want to  ill check the elf  matt itll take a while  i just want to make sure that theres  nothing super valuable just sitting on them  im just gonna im going to keep talking to them  to make sure they know whats up  so just 
none	 talking in their ear  theyre still walking walking  whats going on percy  27  27 at a cursory glance itll take you a couple minutes  which will put you guys a little behind grogs procession  to do this but you manage to find on the two bodies  about 125 gold pieces 2 relatively dirty  sets of leather armor ones more of a hide actually  for the woman who had the rapier its hide armor  and thats it  laura all right  how about on the thing i killed anything  
none	 laura you have a whip  oh they did both  matt yeah  laura can i keep the whip  if you want to  okay you take the whip and wrap it up real fast  and kind of just attach it inside of your belt  sam kinky  can i have everyone make another stealth check  22  30  34  no pass without a trace is gone you used hunters mark  marisha oh then 24 taliesin 24  then 12  liam oh it just burned you  laura oh it did 
town	 it burned  liam 29  21  11  because the extra 10s gone laura im sorry  no its all right  all right you guys move on a little bit further  towards a t portion of the street  where you can now see theres a cart in the center  and what looks to be a number of other goliaths  are currently pulling two individuals out of their homes  and kind of starting to drag them back towards the  top of the t intersection where you guys are passing from  as 
none	 you get to that point  theres a little bit of noise coming that way  you hear another clank and a shh  from behind you in an alley just around the way  and the elf behind you has been walking quietly  stops and goes all rright something not right  is going on at this moment  he turns around you hold here goliath  no i dont think i will  but i tell you what you make the choice  walk me to kevdak or go check out your little spook fest  he 
none	 looks over to the other companion  go ahead and gather those men  have them follow you into the alley  then the other individual walks towards the alley  and starts talking to the other goliaths  they go ahead and take some of the people  that theyre holding by the arms  lift them up over their shoulder  and you now have roughly six individuals  four of which are goliath  now joining up for a total of seven  and theyre all heading back  towards the ally way taliesin hostages heading  
none	 towards you just run just run and hide  matt where the noise came from  as the elf who continues to walk forward with you is back  taliesin just run and hide  sam do we run  yeah yeah yeah we disappear  we disappear  we hide  okay  you guys begin to vanish make one more stealth check  to see if you leave any tracks behind  or any followable trace  taliesin im not with them  ashley do we still have pass without a   laura no im sorry  
none	 because im an asshole  matt you good  hmm  laughter  i got a two  oh no  laughter  sam shes the worst  i hate my armor and i love it in battle  theres a set you never quite picked up from gilmore  ashley fuck  you had commissioned an armor that would be silent  but it never got picked up  oh shit  what  ages ago yeah we commissioned  yeah i was wondering what happened to that  i thought we had it already  liam its buried 
none	 in rubble now  no maybe he  ashley i totally forgot about that  maybe when he was dying he took it with him  laughter  hes got it all under his arm  taliesin maybe he has a magic vault it might be fun  thats true he might have a magic vault  i dont know if thats a real thing  laura he probably has a magic vault  ashley i do not remember that at all  taliesin i just dont remember that either so  laura dammit  the thought hits you immediately 
none	  the memory of like oh thats right  as you tumble through a sequence of small boxes  your distraction caught you off guard  and you werent paying attention where you were walking  briefly before you just fall face first  into kind of a mushy mud puddle  and kind of stand up and look  taliesin scanlan you want to do anything about this  of course i do  im going to run up to her and just hold her by the hand  do they see us at this point  they are 
town	 right around the corner  you see shadows beginning to approach across the road  scanlan the mansion open the mansion in a store  he can do whatever he wants dont tell him what to do  are they going to see us if they round the corner  yes  i hold her by both hands  and i dimension door us to the rooftop  matt youve used dimension door twice now today  thats the third  matt thats your third and final fourth level spell  yes correct  all righty  liam open the 
none	 door do the top one do the bottom lock  laura shh  taliesin ixnay on the arguejay  matt as you guys are bickering  laura no  laughter  around the corner the group steps into the alleyway  as this little poof of purple energy and smoke  quickly dissipates and they all spin looking to the way  they glance about step in to begin to inspect  spend a few moments one of them goes up to where  the barrels had fallen over just kind of pokes  looks into the mud can see 
none	 some depressions in the mud  theres something following us come on  and they all begin to swarm into  the alleyway all seven of them  you guys are you going are you backing up further  into the alley are you trying what are you doing  laura im gonna  im going to try to parkour up to the ceiling again  up to the rooftops  acrobatics  im just going to go backwards  matt go backwards  away from them  matt okay so heading backwards into the alley  can i see 
none	 this happening  no you two are just on the roof  and youre kind of like okay  you can glance over and look on the side if you want to  but thisll be the next  thing you see after they disperse  im just splitting my attention  trying to figure out what to deal with  i go air elemental form  and into a doorway into a crack  okay so elemental form youre now kind of this  little cluster of wind just underneath the doorway  as they all step in and 
town	 look about  laura i 34ed up to the  matt 34ed up  all right and you backed around the way  they step in and begin to kind of split up a little bit  you come back around  and you can head back to the thoroughfare  and continue to follow or find them up on the roof  what are you going to do  im going to follow so i can  try to see grog but stay hidden  so youre going to head back onto the road  and duck between alleyways 
none	 on your own  okay so you can do that way kind of essentially  tracking back around as they entered  and pass them as theyre spreading out into the alleyways  most of you guys are up on the roof now  and keyleth you just kind of watch them as they move past  and eventually just kind of imitates wind  behind them where do you want to go  what  matt what do you want to do  marisha hiding  laughter  they move past and all of you companions  are currently 
none	 gone youre by yourself hiding  this big underneath a doorway in your elemental form  what do you want to do  theyre gone though  matt theyve moved past you yeah they did not notice  sam theyve moved on keyleth  then i try and find them  still in my form but misting about  okay so imitates wind this little burst of wind  that comes up to the rooftop  and as you get up there you can see a couple roofs over  a couple of dots the rest of your companions  
town	 that are slowing making their way along the road  marisha okay i follow them  okay you guys make your way  travis you lot are so funny you know i think i saw something  running behind that pile of horse shit over there  if you want to check it out too  laughter  silence no response  marisha since im already elemental form  im going to go ahead and start parting off  from the rest of the crowd  im going to flake around to the other side  im going to start 
town	 flanking  okay so youve got to the other side now  the bells have now fully subsided  all the various warning bells  that would go off every few minutes  just kind of keeping the state of awareness going  have begun to just dissipate and stop  the elf behind you is kind of glancing back and forth  over his shoulder but still keeps a blade forward  you go past that t intersection continuing onward  into the open central square  on the north portion of the road  theres the main central 
town	 road  that you guys have been walking  and it opens up into brick and cobblestone  upward with a slight square road interfacing the center  a series of shops and tents and on the left side  you recall is where nojas shop once was  abjurist noja who had saved you at the first winters veil  not that you guys see this at the moment  but you see this glancing off to the side  the doors kind of half open  it looks like a windows broken  and the inside has probably 
none	 been ransacked as well  and as you step in you can see that there  are a number of tents that are half fallen over  carts that are tipped over with fruit and vegetables  that have scattered across the floor  and theyve just been left there to rot  there are barrels containing looks like rain water  that has gathered over time  and section after section of these wedged barricades  of pieces of wood that have been jammed into piles  with giant spikes and pole arms  that have been jammed in 
none	 there as a defensive place  and just to be an ominous position  for anyone who attempts to walk into this vicinity  and you see about every five or six of these  there is a head adorning it that has been just kind of  wedge on pushed as a warning  travis recognize any of those heads  matt make a perception check  laura oh god  liam i dont want to know the answer  sam well i recognized a couple earlier  marisha yeah you did i dont think youve told us yet 
none	  seven  yeah you glance around a little bit  nothing catches your eye youre too focused on the goal  at hand as you step through each barricade  as you go through the first set  already you can see the cluster of goliaths  and as well as individuals that step forward  and are like hey who are you bringing here  and the elf behind you says  apparently a blood relative of kevdaks  is this true  and a few of the goliaths step forward and say  oh i doubt that 
none	  and the one on the other side says  blood relative the only one is up inside  he steps forward and you see the next goliath  that you recognize this is one of the older seers  who has one eye that is completely clouded over white  and is this kind of swollen puss filled socket  that has been kind of perpetually infected over time  laura ew  he steps forward with this kind of  thick kind of a almost like a mosslike crust  that just kind of has gathered under his 
none	 neck  and hes called greenbeard because of this  weird whatever infection or ailment he had  caused this kind of mosstype material  to grow across his neck and chest area  and he kind of comes forward using his walking stick  this kind of gnarled branch that he uses and  is it really you strongjaw  i see your eye still serves you well  you know when zanror told us that he came across you  up north we beat the shit out of him for being a liar  you should have beat 
town	 the shit out of him  for being a coward  he begged me to let him go  really  well seems we know at least whos  caused all the commotion recently  dead man walking through town by himself  into the belly of the beast  so men  take his head  he steps back as about seven other goliaths  from up behind and two longbow individuals in the far end  go ahead and draw arrows and begin to notch them back  i take a beat  travis well it would be 
none	 such a shame  it seems all of you would be missing out  on the greatest show of your life  you see in this bag i carry the very thing  that will topple the mighty kevdak  you know what i remember  i remember a herd that nations used to part for  i remember a herd that towns used to quake and run from  i remember a herd that was so proud and dangerous  they would never hole up in a shitstick city like this  but what do i see when i 
none	 come here  kevdak prancing up in a place like this  and what bending the knee to a dragon  how far you have fallen  now if you have any honor in you at all  youll take me to kevdak and you will see what  i have for him and then maybe  just maybe you can call yourselves warriors again  instead of piss pot squatters  theres a moment of pause as all the goliaths  who are approaching have stopped in their tracks  you can see their neck muscles tensing  as 
none	 theyre kind of ringing their fingers  across the handles of their various weapons  at this point greenbeard takes a moment and  laughs evilly  you sound like your cousin zanror  the two of you enjoy a night drinkin in the hole  but sure you want to go ahead and talk to the big man  lets see you say that to his face before he crushes it  call him out  thunder lord youve a visitor  marisha thunder lord  at which point all the goliaths step back  and some of them 
none	 turn their blades or weapons around and   start slamming them on the ground in a rhythmic tone  group groans  over and over again and some of them  start going into slow chants imitates chanting  and as this happens louder and louder  the clattering echos through  the center of this market place this now desolate space  some of them that were clutching people  just kind of throw them to the side  and some of the peasants begin like scramble up  against a wall not knowing where to go  
dung	 or seemingly knowing that if they were to try to flee  it would be the very end of their existence  and are just frozen in fear  as this is happening you see at the margraves home  the multitiered homestead this beautiful mansion  which is now smeared with gore  this dried dark brown and brittle  the flickering glow of interior  candlelight catches your attention  until across the top floor you see a balcony  that looks over the entirety of this open area  and there the dark form of kevdak steps 
none	 out  a towering goliath in his own right  as he comes forward puts his hands on the railing  the rhythmic slamming of the weapons growing loud  like this cacophonous rhythm  his fingers slowly tense and the wood  splinters in his grasp as you can see before you  indeed the titanstone gauntlets themselves  almost cartoonish in size even against his large frame  he looks down with his gleaming red eyes  smooth bald head no tattoo adorning it  but most of his entire body nearly black  with scrawlings of ink 
none	 for every single life hes taken  as hes led this herd  he looks down  laughter  into the center of this area down to you  with a joyous smile almost and says  grog strongjaw  i would have never expected this  not in a very very long time  ive got to say ive got to give credit to my boy  for not being quite the fable maker that i thought he was  trying to appease me with the ideas of  finishing a threat that was apparently left hanging  so 
none	 you come here cast away of the herd of storms  you have my attention now what words do you  bring my ears before i tear them from your skull boy  hello uncle  the piece of shit you wiped off your boot has come home  when last we saw each other  you saw it fitting to beat down a mere child  i remember another child that got a beating  seems like he came from your nut sack  laughter  and my what an easy task that was  sometimes the easiest are 
none	 the most enjoyable  if you let them string out for a long long time  well a regular chip off the old block  if hes anything like his father that is  so ill tell you why ive come back  please do  see ive grown ive learned  ive also watched as dragons took the mighty kevdak  wielder of the titanstone knuckles  and made him bend the knee  i was wondering do you also squat when you piss now  laughter  there are a few chuckles theyre immediately  silenced at the 
none	 realization  kevdak seemingly unflinched by this  he puts one hand on the railing and leaps over it  imitates booming  landing on the stone platform that makes the roof  of the initial walkway and foyer of this mansion  he steps out to the edge of it and crosses his arms  and goes see thats your folly grog  as it was your fathers youre shortsighted  survival isnt just chewing meat you find  and killing what gets in your way  if you pick a fight that you cant win  history wont 
none	 remember a blood smear on anyones boot  the dragon was a stage  ive not bent the knee like you think i have  ive merely let it coexist for the time being  but lets just say that dragons days are numbered  but its a shame that you wont be around to see  oh fancy words for what i hear as surrender  but thats all right ive always believed  the world is what we make of it  and youve shown me exactly who you are  youve shown this herd exactly who you 
none	 are  and what they can expect to live a nice domesticated life  where the booty runs dry where the women are scarce  where im sure there are plans this very minute  to unseat you from your high horse  but ive come to do them a favor  theyre not going to get that chance  you and me  i challenge you to single combat for the pride of this herd  applause  at this moment there is a long silence  as just a breeze kind of imitates wind  finds its way 
town	 through the center of this town  kevdak waits motionless  at the top of the mansion precipice  everyone else looks up to him from you  their faces aghast at what just transpired  and staring up to him atop the mansion  he looks down one side of his mouth  curls into a wicked smirk  he puts his hand up like this  and you see as the rows of archers  that were along the roof tops of nearby buildings  lessen their grip on the bow and put the arrows away  he 
none	 crosses his arms again  we reserve the right of single combat  to members of the herd of storms  you havent been a number within our midst for years  since you decided to lie there and bleed like a goat  but i cant say im not amused by your gall  so for the purposes of this bout  let it be known that grog strongjaw  is a temporary member of the herd  but the moment his lifeless corpse hits the stone  he will be stripped of any honor and fed to the 
town	 wolves  growls  and he leaps off and lands cracking  the stone beneath his feet  as he stands again assemble the ring  and you watch as all of the goliaths  start grabbing and moving the barricades  scooting them into a circular pattern  around the center of this area  go ahead and fetch the town square if you could  laura oh jeez  group fetch the town square if you please  laughter  oh my god  oh look  taliesin you really did it you son of a bitch  
tavern	 you werent kidding  laughter  taliesin three days ago  we had dinner and he left the sushi bar  with a big handful of toothpicks going  i have plans for these  laughter  laura thats hilarious  marisha thats true i was like did you steal toothpicks  he did  matt all righty so  laura and sam oh my god  its beautiful and its all made out of cake  laughter  liam i cant believe i ate the whole thing  fuck that house look at that house  laura the spikes 
none	 are facing inward  matt yes they are  liam oh its so tight  liam and laura tight tight tight tight tight tight  are we around can we see any of this  matt you guys are watching this happen  marisha yeah where are we  were flanking slowly but surely  laura stealthily  taliesin im finding perch on a rooftop  so that i can deal with this shit  marisha im a puff of clouds  sam im holding pikes hand  laughter  sam for comfort my comfort  laura im feel guilty 
none	 for getting in a fight with my  brother right before i got up on the rooftop  taliesin this is a great idea  sam this is the part where matt plays dolls  matt yep pretty much  laughter  all right so where are you guys right now  youre watching this happen from a  distant rooftop right at the edge  taliesin is it possible to move the camera to get the house  i was flanking  matt right so you are currently in elemental form  kind i kind of attempt to actually 
none	 get on the roof  matt on the roof  marisha can i get on this balcony area  matt over there  if you want to its going to be  marisha in mist form  matt this isnt a mist form  this is your air elemental form  or yeah air elemental form  but i can move through things  matt you can so you can  super super super thin  matt right so you want to just glide into like  part of the stonework over here or  marisha right yeah  all 
dung	 righty  so at this time as everyone assembles  all the spikes inward in a circle position  and you stand in place kevdak walks into  the center of the ring he takes the gauntlets  puts a hand out and one of the goliaths comes up  and takes a weapon that you havent seen in a while  this dark red rustcolored ax is placed into his one hand  as the gauntlet grips around it  taking the blood ax in his hand  he closes his other fist and slams them together  and 
none	 as he slams them together with a sound of metal  his form warps and grows  and what was once already kevdak  who held a good four to five inches on your height  swells to about 12 feet tall  marisha excuse me  oh shit  sam wait kevdak just grew  yes  laura kevdak just grew  sam oh my god  marisha holy shit  taliesin ashley or pike  matt so whereabouts are you guys at this moment  just give me some inclination  keyleth is over there keeping relatively hidden

none	 the rage of my ragey life  laughter  and i would like to use intimidating presence on kevdak  okay  sam thats a risk  laughter  matt all right so thats your action on that  so whats the dc on that one  travis 18  matt and whats the save  travis oh 17 is the wisdom saving throw  for that one do you remember if that one is a  travis it says within 30 feet frighten until end of next turn  wisdom saving throw  matt yeah okay so as you 
none	 glare how do you go about this glare  what do you do to intimidate him  i go into a rage  and with my flaming war hammer i grab the end of the  hammer and let it cook my flesh for a minute  and then i smack myself on the chest  and rip out the biggest bellow i have  as you do kevdak goes to take a step forward  takes the single step hesitates  seems to just hold his ground  eyeing you down and seemingly not expecting this ferocity  all 
none	 righty thats your action and your bonus  are you going to move  or are you going to stay where you are  there are no openings in the ring right  matt nope  sam you had inspiration by the way  would that have helped at all  there are side openings like areas here  where you could step out but you get the sense that  as people are gathering around  they would be plugging elements of this exit  to prevent you from  closing the gap  with my bonus action i 
none	 yell coward  and thats it  matt okay technically the rage is the bonus action  but you can shout that for free  yeah thats fine  all right so for kevdaks turn  kevdak kind of realizing that he cant  hes not able to really move closer at this moment  kind of steps to the side here guarding kind of waiting  liam his version of fear was not digging in  matt yeah hes going to go ahead and take a bonus action  to go into his own rage  i just had 
none	 to try and make it work at least once  sam it worked  travis and it did  hey man at least i can say  i didnt die without it working once  laura dont say that  ashley youre not going to die grog  so kevdak goes into his own rage  as kevdak goes into a rage screaming out  growls  the ground shakes and little stones and rocks  scatter across the stonework from the vibration of it  and you see some of those tattoos  the black ink that goes across 
dung	 his chest  you see what looks like a bear  that is hidden within the tattoo  that flares up with a flash of dark deep red crimson energy  and then fades back into the chest  laura what  taliesin 1984 with it  matt youre up grog  raging  ill go into a frenzied rage and i charge headlong  into kevdak with my firebrand war hammer  matt all right  actually he backed up against the ring right  group excitedly exclaims  matt hes backed up against the edge  of one 
none	 of the openings but if you want to go from here  but theres large pointies behind him right  matt at one angle yeah  id like to drive my head right into his chest  can i move into him hard  see if i can push him back against one of the spikes  ill say sure  i still have if im frenzying  would i still have two attacks after that  that would be your action to do that  so you would have your bonus action of you wanted to  ill just 
none	 run up to him and hit him three times  okay go for it  yeah the first two are just normal  ill just roll these first  27  that hits  24  hits  16  misses  ashley war gods blessing  matt whats the range on that  laura oh and you have inspiration thats right  taliesin yeah but this may not be the moment though  sam ive got more  taliesin its early  ashley where the fuck is my thing  oh its right in front of me  unfortunately 
none	 inspiration fades in ten minutes  ashley 30 feet so  30 feet yeah thats too far away  for war gods blessing  so the first two strikes go ahead and roll for damage  travis okay  they do hit  where the fuck is it  oh there it is  10 15 23 23 oh 23 plus  five so 28 with the fire damage on the first one  and the second one  17  17 okay  as you slam whack whack with the flaming war hammer  twice into the oversize kevdaks 
none	 chest  each hit hits but kevdak is just barely pushed back by each  and the damage even the fire damage seems to be taken  down by his raging capabilities  the impacts arent doing as much damage  as you hoped they would  sam dammit  matt but i believe that ends  your turn unless you want to move  nope no moving  matt all right kevdaks turn kevdaks going to go ahead  and strafe around this way  and his going to go ahead and reckless attack on you  so thats 
none	 an advantage on each strike  is going to take both of these as weapon master  that is a 28 to hit sorry minus five 23  travis hits  second one  28 to hit again with the minus five  travis misses i mean hits sorry  all right lets see  less than that  as both of the ax swings come through you  you suffer a total of 54 points of slashing damage  travis reduced  reduced by half so that brings it to 27  plus an additional ten points of necrotic 
none	 damage  that you do not reduce  laura while all the attention is focused on them  can i stealth down to the ground for a second  matt make a stealth check  how are you getting down  are you climbing down via acrobatics  so make a stealth and acrobatics check  29 for stealth  and 25 for acrobatics  okay you manage to make it to the ground  kind of jumping off the side parkouring down  grabbing the next ledge leaping down  thats your turn  okay anybody else doing anything 
none	  until we come back in the next round  sam i mean  marisha do we do anything right now  not until he says so  laura i just want to duck can i just  duck in the building at least  is that part of the stealth  matt sure you come to the door  and the door itself is not locked  you kind of just push on the side of the door  everyones attention is so focused on the center  all right so that brings it to the top of the 
none	 round  grog youre up  feeling the impact of those hits  and remembering our first encounter  i drop the firebrand war hammer  i rush kevdak and i want to try and rip away the blood ax  marisha oh  matt okay  you rush up and drop the hammer  grab and youre face to face  its right at your feet you reach up and grab  with your fingers just barely wrapped around this  axs shaft right now at the size that its swollen  and you pull against him  i 
none	 want you to go ahead and make a strength check  travis which i get advantage on  matt yeah versus his strength  which he gets advantage on  17  natural 20  laura oh come on  as you pull kevdak actually lifts you up off the ground  holding the ax up to his face and just goes  like father like son  and shakes you off well doesnt even shake you off  just butts you off of the ax and you skid to the ground  take one point of bludgeoning damage no 
none	 big deal  land on the ground you dont fall prone  but youre there and can probably grab  your war hammer and pick it back up if you want to  travis yep ill do that  taliesin oh my god oh my god  that ends your turn  now kevdak whos kind of laughing to himself  laughs evilly  marisha oh hes consulting the book  taliesin i hate when he does that  why what could that possibly mean  liam hes probably looking up the price of a mace  marisha totally  
none	 whats an adventurers kit run for  sam who did this illustration again  oh yeah i remember  matt why dont you make an athletics check  taliesin does he get advantage on that  matt yes you do because of the rage  19  19 well 22  he puts the ax to one hand  reaches down with his large mitt  grabs you and lifts you up  and pushes you onto one of the spears behind you  you can feel it actually pierce out the front of your chest  group groans  
none	 about six inches  your feet are still on the ground  and you can feel yourself there  but there is an element of being pinned there  you take 12 points of piercing damage reduced to six  this is nothing to a barbarian simple piercing whatever  however you are technically considered  this would be grappled youre unable to move  until you manage to break this  you can still attack from this position if you wanted to  but you have to be able to try  and spend an action to get free 
none	  so thats going to be the one attack  and then as your pinned hes going to  come up with the blood ax and swing down  thats going to be a 23 against you  blood ax comes down and slams right  into the front of your chest the sternum area  even with the weight of it  you bring your hands up and grab the edge of it  and manage to stop some of the force  but it still digs into the front of your chest  you take 19 points of 
none	 slashing damage reduced to 9  i release trinket inside the house that im in  matt plus an additional six necrotic  that does not get reduced  so 9 and then six so 15  matt what are you doing  i release trinket quietly inside the house  and tell him to keep quiet  dont follow me  okay anyone else do anything else  taliesin no im just trying to  im trying to keep us aware of everything as possible  pike an i are going to just inch forward  on the rooftop 
none	 to get just a little closer  yeah can i do the same in my elemental form  like can i just mist kind of down around  kind of right behind this asshole  whats up im a spooky mist  ashley would it take some time  to get like behind that fountain  liam thats in the open i asked about that first  taliesin this is one quarter of the square  all right grog its your turn  you said i can attack from having  a pole shoved through my shoulder  matt yeah 
none	  would that be at disadvantage  matt no not at this distance  you just youre grappled so you cant move  youre essentially stuck there until you use an action  to get off of it otherwise you cant go anywhere  yeah i got to get off of it  im going to get off of it  matt okay so using an action to break free  yeah  matt make an athletics check  with advantage because youre raging  23  matt 23  theres not a lot of ground to pull yourself  
none	 off of the weight so instead with your feet on the ground  you reach forward and grab the front  of his blood ax again and pull forward  and as you do you feel the back of this wooden spear  snap off and its still just embedded in your chest  poking out the front but you are now free  you still have your bonus action  i would like to use great weapon master  and i have advantage on this because he used reckless  matt yep  and ill use his inspiration  
none	 laura if you need it  matt it faded it only lasts for ten minutes  23  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  19  no 29 sorry  29 with the plus ten right  okay that brings it to 14 damage  reduced by his rage effect as well  as the hammer slams once again into his abdomen  you can see it leaving a char mark  and actually kind of obscuring one of the tattoos  stupid boy  you can move around him if you wanted to  you still 
none	 have a movement  yeah ill move i would like to move to his flank  away from the nearest pointy thing  matt okay so you shift around that way  okay with his turn now he spins around to face you  hes going to go ahead and attempt his first attack on you  as a disarming attack  with advantage on that because  just going with this attack every round  thats going to be a 30  travis yeah thatll hit  laughter  okay not great weapon master  but its 30 so 
none	 its going to do an additional  superiority die of damage on top of this  taliesin oh my god  so you take all right  17 points of slashing damage  travis nine  eight plus two necrotic so 10 total  and i need you to go ahead and make a strength saving throw  taliesin oh no no advantage  matt with rage is it strength  ability checks and saving throws  advantage on strength check and strength saving throws  matt so yeah so advantage on this  13  matt 13  no 
none	 no no 16  matt 16 okay  so as he slams into your side  you pull up your flaming war hammer to guard the blow  it takes some of it but then he hooks the bottom of the ax  underneath the head and actually flings it out of your hand  and you lose the grip on the war hammer  which then clatters to the ground at your feet  hes then going to turn around  and going to go ahead and do a pushing attack  with the superiority die  that is 
none	 going to be this is going to be  with great weapon master that brings it to a 21  travis thats my ac  matt all righty so you take from the actual blow  21 points of slashing damage reduced to ten  and five necrotic  im going to use my stones endurance  matt go for it  laura whats stones endurance  its just a d12 which is a 12  plus my constitution so thats 17  so as the blow comes you just take it  right to the center of the chest 
none	  as it hits it barely cuts in before you  go ahead and grab and deflect it with your hand  doing no damage to you whatsoever  however the impact of it though  make a strength saving throw with advantage again  18  18 however the sheer force of trying to deflect it  does push you back 15 feet right on the edge there  well say youre right there thats fine  and you stop right at the edge of another  edge of the spikes and there are two goliaths  that are 
none	 there with their weapons out  just forcing you back into the ring  if you decide to back up any further  and with that kevdaks going to go ahead and move forward  and push you into that corner  thats going to end his turn  youre up  im going to look at kevdak and drop my arms to my side  matt its already on your side actually  he disarmed you  no not my arms  matt oh your arms okay  straight down  and im going to say clearly ive been 
none	 a fool  you are truly a foe to be reckoned with  and i will slowly drop to my knees  sam gasps  quietly no no grog  and i will shout out  vox machina  fuck shit up  cheering  and were going to go ahead and end it there this week  loud exclamations  its 11 oclock guys  oh all right  groaning  its 11 oclock  marisha and we started late  i know i know  marisha curse you technical difficulties  laughter  wow  we need to
