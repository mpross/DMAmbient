right  travis now we go to our deaths  matt now /none/ we bring it back i will ask if we could turn that speaker down a little bit a  little bit more thats good great all right guys lets plug in to the world of exandria as  we begin tonights episode of critical role so last we left off the adventuring party of vox  machina traversing the lands in search of lost artifacts of wars of old referred to as the  vestiges of divergence in hopes of eventually tearing down and defeating a conclave of chromatic  dragons called the chroma conclave that have destroyed society all /none/ across the continent of  taldorei and beyond you returned to the outskirts of a city named westruun that was very  important in your early adventures to find it from a distance partially destroyed by the dragon  attack but a couple weeks before and since taken over by what seems to be the remnants now  swelling in power and size of grogs old herd of wandering barbarians and various savages having  taken the city by force and ruling it with an iron hand it was also deemed not the right time to  face this foe /dung/ and as such the party continued venturing southward in the direction of the  frostweald where somewhere at the base of the stormpeak mountains the mate of osysa the  gynosphinx you had met in vasselheim her mate resides somewhere in this vicinity thats all the  information you have to go on as you head down towards the frozen forest so thats where we  begin as you guys continue pushing south from westruun seeing the distant pillars of dark smoke  that slowly drift into the atmosphere disappear as the town itself vanishes over the horizon you  /none/ continue to push southward through the open grass fields you continue traveling for the better part  of a day eventually coming up along the side of the silvercut channel which is the river that  comes down and cuts through near kraghammer to the west of westruun it goes past kymal and then  eventually heads down in this direction towards the foramere basin you guys travelling fairly  quickly as youre in your mist forms which is making up a lot of the normal travel time you  would have to worry about here by the time the /none/ sun finally begins to set across the mountains  pay attention please  sam yes  matt sorry  liam its another beholder  matt ive got plenty of things i could throw in here if you guys arent paying attention  taliesin thats not funny  matt no its really funny for me as you guys continue pushing southward as the sun slowly  begins to set in the distance you glance over towards the foramere basin you can see just over  to the right the city of kymal which has lights glimmering in the far distance but /none/ what you see  by the basin itself is this large lake that is centered in this region just north of the  frostweald you can see where the two main rivers diverge before heading southward towards the  ocean theres a smattering of various tents that are clustered right towards the side of the  riverbank and the edge of the lake itself as you continue coasting overhead in your mist forms you  see small trails of smoke from smoldering campfires clusters of people and families  wandering the shore in this small group you continue going forward /town/  sam i mean we should check it out  laura yeah  matt you dont have to you can keep going  sam its a tent city  matt it looks like it yeah  laura theyre refugees probably  sam hundreds thousands  matt theres probably a few dozen close to maybe 50 60  marisha what do the tents look like do they look like military encampment tents or refugee tents  matt you cant really tell from this distance especially as the light is beginning to slowly  diminish  travis can we float closer  /none/ laura we float down we float down  sam oh are we still mists  laura yeah  sam oh my god  travis that whole description and yes were still mists  matt as you coast down closer you get a better look and yeah there are about 50 60 or so  people on the outside you dont have an idea of how many are inside the tents even more most  likely but these tents are fairly ramshackle barely standing the people look destitute they  look like theyre holding onto survival here on the outside of /none/ the city you see a few boats that  are going in and out on the shore probably fishermen there are a few bonfires that are now  starting to kick up as the nights cold begins to swell in it looks like this is a fairly  thriving a fairly functional refugee camp  travis well those that give a fuck speak up  laura we cant were in mist form  travis then like hissing in a direction  laura hissing i think we should help them maybe we can   taliesin buzzing fart sound  sam /none/ good point  laura maybe we can send them back to whitestone  taliesin maybe if we could talk which we cant right now  laura i float down into the trees outside of the camp  taliesin i follow  matt okay these are open grasslands there arent a lot of trees and theyre spotted around  there are a few rock formations and small hills you might be able to get out of sight  laura around there  matt so you coast around there and you go back into your physical form the rest of you follow /none/  travis tall grass low grass  matt its probably thighlength  liam following  travis yeah we go  matt for you close to the knee  laura near the rocks so that were in camouflage  matt so you guys set down maybe 300 feet from the outside of the nearest part of the camp  reconstitute into your physical forms at this point the sun has now disappeared over the  horizon and the blues have now gone to orange to purple and you can see in the distance the  darkness of night is starting to /none/ crest over the sky what do you want to do  travis what are we stopped for are we here  laura no it looks like a refugee camp grog  taliesin they may have information  laura people that escaped from westruun potentially  travis oh really  laura yeah i mean its a large group of people im assuming they came from a city of some sort  travis hey scanlan  sam oi  travis if we go over there and it gets a little hairy youve still got old magic door right  sam old magic /none/ doll  travis hugh hefner house  sam oh yeah magic door yes  travis magic doll if you have it too for later but yeah  sam i mean i have a little pike figurine that i keep with me  taliesin oh  sam what no its a keepsake  travis yeah im sure it is  sam why is everything i say creepy  liam i dont know why is it  laura maybe we should pop them back to whitestone i feel like it might be good if we find out if  theyre hurting thats /none/ where were putting our survivors  liam they look like theyre hurting  marisha i couldnt help with that today  laura oh we could rest overnight and you could pop them in in the morning  marisha what time is it  liam its late suns gone down  travis super late yeah and if theyre from westruun  laura are you out of all your oh mist form  marisha mist form got us here  taliesin its worth talking to them at the very least  travis yeah pike and i are from westruun if theyre of /none/ that village or that city id like to  make sure theyre all right  marisha maybe theyre friends  laura maybe wed find pikes grandfather  travis grandfather wilhelm  laura percy would whitestone be able to sustain this many more people  taliesin i think at some point were going to have to have that conversation but for now i  think well probably be all right  travis yeah  laura all right  travis youre good for it youre rich  taliesin for now  liam heres an idea scanlan you said that a lot of /none/ people can go into your house yeah  sam i can fit many people into my hole  liam could you laughs  marisha i wonder why everything he says is creepy  liam could you invite the folk in and then they live in your hole for a little while and then  when we get to whitestone you open your hole and out they come  sam no not quite  marisha thats some cartel shit right there  travis yeah we become vox machina coyotes  liam scanlan is the mule  sam no the house is /none/ mainly for us and a few guests for one night at a time  laura you cant like leave them there  liam didnt you say 100 people the other day  sam 100 servants are in there i dont quite i havent jammed people in there i dont know how  many it can totally hold  marisha you mean youve never thrown a party  matt go ahead and roll an intelligence check  sam first roll of the night natural 20  cheering  sam wasted it on an intelligence check  laughter  travis smile upon /none/ us dice gods  matt though the magic is new to you youve spent in your first time casting it and a large part of  the evening especially since you realized you werent going to have as fun a night as you  thought after the broom had been taken and vex left your room learning the intricacies of the  spell itself and the pocket dimension that is created you can fit quite a few people in there  however it is stationary in its entrance and exit and then once the spell comes to completion after  /none/ a 24hour period it expels anyone and anything that was brought into it on the spot where it was  originally cast  liam i see  laura oh  travis like gently or like  sam like a flush  travis like sweetly please leave or like angry get the fuck out  liam is that a yes or a no  sam its not a transportingtype spell it is a temporary shelter at best  liam you just dont want to bring them in  sam i have a cold cold heart  laughter  sam listen ill /none/ consider taking the females in  travis that is very noble of you  laura so noble scanlan  travis i will join him in this charity  laura oh yes  marisha well all right why dont we just walk around and talk to these people maybe theyre not  even interested in being transported lets just find some citizens around  laura should we make sure theyre actually innocent nice people  marisha we should probably do that as well not like a band of thieves bandits  laura stealth ahead  travis that could be fun  /dung/ laura can i sneak ahead and just listen to them  sam yes sneaking up on them will definitely put them on our side  laura hey like 100 yards out i just want to hear what theyre saying  sam all right all right  liam she can read lips so she doesnt even get that close  laura its pretty dark though but i do have good darkvision  matt this is true as the night takes over its still quite a distance to be able to make out a  lot of detail youd probably have to /none/ get closer but youre going alone  travis no twins  matt twins going together  laura yeah  matt why dont you both roll a stealth check  liam oh i guess im going then  taliesin im keeping an eye also to see if anything from a great distance im just keeping  an eye out  laura were in the woods right  matt no you are in the plains  sam there are no woods tall grasses  laura just kidding were in the grasslands  liam grass grass 32  travis ill roll this big /none/ bastard  taliesin white manna not green manna  laura 18  matt all right  sam im hiding in a tree  matt theres no annoyed hmm  laura theres no  laughter  travis theres no grumbles  sam the grass to me is like a tree  matt this is true actually its more of a rose bush so as you guys push forward pushing and  stalking through the grass you come to about 40 50 feet outside and theres a little bit of  chatter its hard to make out at this distance but the /none/ people seem to not necessarily be jovial  almost like theyve accepted the circumstances and are just surviving it for the time being there  are a few individuals that are armed though the armor itself seems patchwork or you know not the  best or most trained of individuals currently guarding this group of survivors but there are  patrols going around people keeping a close look there are torches being lit now as people begin  walking  laura do we see anyone that we recognize from westruun  matt not from this distance  laura no  /none/ matt with your darkvision you can make out the outline of the very very nearest individuals the  guards in particular but at this distance nobody catches your eye that youd be able to make out  much detail on that you would recognize  liam can we just sit for five or ten minutes  laura well the guards are coming through with torches i dont want them to find us and think  were spies  liam but we are  laura yeah but i dont want them to think that  liam but we are  laura /none/ yeah i think you can stay cause youre more hidden than i am im going to go back to the  group  liam all right  laura i feel like theyre going to see me  liam all right  matt chuckling you dont know that as far as you know youre so hidden  laura im so hidden shit  travis come on  laura all right all right all right just a second  liam im just going to stay here for a couple of minutes longer wait you said they were coming  our direction or /none/ theyre just   matt no theyre just wandering just patrolling  laura oh all right  liam youre paranoid  laura okay fine fine fine fine  liam let me listen for a bit  matt okay ill have you both roll perception checks if you could  liam all right 22  laura 23  matt okay you two at about the same time focus best you can you have to scoot a little bit  closer once the guard thats nearest to you passes by you wait for your moment scoot up close get  by one /town/ of the tents and look off to the side there are a few folks that catch your attention a  little bit theres one that was elowen brist who was the mother of the first child that  went missing in westruun you see her with her daughter whos a little bit older now that you  guys helped save her  marisha oh my god  liam all these throwbacks are blowing my mind  matt a little dirty but alive they wander off you scan through the crowd keeping an eye out for  the guard as well /none/ no one really catches your attention you see one older gentleman that walks  by 60s not completely withered away but you know older but carries himself with much  importance very expensive clothing reds and blues it seems like hes attempting to hold a  social station even though in his current location society has crumbled he doesnt really  catch your attention as anyone you recognize but the person to the left of him is a very  familiarlooking elven man with long brown hair slicked over and behind his ears this is drez  vina who originally /none/ contacted you when you arrived in westruun  laura holy whispers thats drez vina  liam yeah yeah  matt hes looking a little rough too this has not been the kindest time to any of these people  laura well should we go back to the group or tell them to come on in  liam do we have to go back to tell them to come on in  laura we have earrings  liam well yeah thats true  laura whispering hey you guys  travis what  sam what what what what what  laura you /tavern/ guys hey percy pay attention  taliesin oh yeah yes hello what  laura hey guess who im looking at right now  taliesin your brother  laura well  sam god youre so good at that  laura drez fucking vina  marisha gasps drez  sam wait remind us who   laura drez vina was that dude that sent us on our very first mission together you guys  taliesin ooh  marisha yeah he protected us hes a magic user  sam oh i was mostly drunk that time  laura yeah percy you werent there /none/ yet  taliesin oh at the winters crest festival i remember  matt laughing thats not him at all  liam no he was drez vina  travis thats not it at all chuckles  laura percy you werent there  matt thats abjurist noja  marisha and taliesin in unison oh abjurist noja  liam drez vina was the dick drez vinas a dick  laura drez vinas the guy drez vina was the asshole  sam doesnt he work for someone else  matt he had a master  marisha wait was he the guy that we stole /none/ from kind of  laura hey keep it down i dont know who all can hear over these earrings  travis oh did he have the tower with the magical items  matt here i should step in here and clarify  laughter  marisha its been like three years  liam this was only three years ago  matt no i know drez vina came to you under the pretense that he was working for an individual  called the master he called him his master who was interested in hiring your services originally  sent you into the /tavern/ mage tower of eskil ryndarien the realmseer to steal the brass box with the  pearl top however you did not steal it and instead you ended up befriending the archmage  travis he let us pick something  matt yes he let you pick something from his array of items  sam thats right  matt drez then found you guys at your inn a number of weeks later and drez was very unhappy  that you both didnt return with the item and used a very powerful and expensive object that  was part of this endeavor and /none/ never paid it back so to pay back your debt he sent you guys to the  druid barrow where you had to retrieve this cortex this magical gem that was embedded in the  center of  marisha and that was where we fought the golem  matt yep where you fought the golem and you retrieved the cortex successfully and thats  the last youve seen of him  laura see he likes us now we totally helped him  sam but he has magical items  laura well maybe not anymore  sam had well we should /none/  liam what was dm can you remind me the name of the mother that we spoke to all that time ago  laura the one you just mentioned  matt elowen  liam elowen elowen id rather go talk to her  matt im pretty sure let me check my notes yeah elowen elowen brist  laura do you guys want to just come on in  sam yes lets go in  taliesin i dont see what the harm is  travis we go in  laura make a nice pleasant chattering maybe you should sing scanlan as /none/ you  approach so that people know were nice  sam i would love to sing oh right now singing sunny days chasing the dragons away on  our way to where the air is clean can you tell me how to kill how to kill some drageens  matt go ahead and roll a performance check  sam performance check  matt yes  laura what is it what is it  sam it fell off the table and it is a six but plus 13  matt okay  sam wait plus 14  matt plus 14 okay /none/ okay so as you guys begin strolling up immediately you see torches fire sounds  liam hands up no weapons  matt you see guards come forward two of them with nocked crossbows who goes there  laura hey you guys  matt and they dont really recognize theyre all looking at this source of singing  crossbows  sam singing its a magic carpet ride except we burned our magic carpet so we cant  laughter  matt the guards slowly drop their crossbows whats your business  travis hey hey thats not necessary were friends  matt weve /none/ already got enough mouths to feed move along  travis no were not looking for food were here to provide aid if we can if its in need if people  need our help  matt make a persuasion check  travis oh shit  sam persuasion you  laura grog  travis ten  matt while their crossbows are notched they havent lowered them completely theyre still on  guard and still nervous of your approach  liam we also think theres a woman with you named elowen she knows us wed like to speak to  her well /none/ wait here  matt one of them glances over at the other one one of the guards who was paying attention walks  away and they all raise their crossbows again and just train them on you guys for the next few  minutes  travis i mean its really not necessary even if you were to loose those it would just be a  tickle i mean trust me we come from westruun all right  laura dont you remember us in westruun  travis yeah winters crest festival  laura vox machina  travis grog  pike wilhelm /town/  matt one of the guards takes a moment and gives you an eye and just goes  i remember seeing you around town you were oh man jeez its good to see you  travis right im as psyched about all this  matt sorry if i gave you any trouble back in the day i was young and stupid  sam why dont you all lower your crossbows for a second  matt i mean no offense but were very guarded with your kind at the moment  travis inhales right yeah yeah understandable right we just actually /none/ came from  westruun it seems to be a bit occupied at the moment  marisha and hes with us so hes not with them  laura hes different than the other guys see hes got a beard  travis no i listen it came about my own i just got the genetics for it  stagewhispers would you shut up  matt at which point the guard that had left comes back with elowen she walks up with her  tightly braided reddish hair with a little bit of grey on the sides that probably has come since the /none/  last time youve seen her and the experience of having her child gone so long its taken a  physical toll on her but there is a smile on her face now she looks over and focuses her eyes  liam elowen  matt thats them thats them let them in let them in and she runs forward immediately and  gives a big hug to you vex  laura oh  matt and starts moving through and you know just this big smile and surprise and you can see  her little boy simon come up to the /none/ side  all oh simon  matt simon who last time you saw you were retrieving him from the pocket dimension that the  dread emperor had called his domain at which point theres a few quick pleasantries as she  says hello again she says please please come in please its fine theyre trustworthy and  the guards nod and they follow behind not in an aggressive way but just in a beingcareful kind of  way so you have two people two armed individuals flanking you the entire walk that you guys are  doing but its at /none/ ease  marisha keyleth goes up to simon  matt hi  marisha how old are you now  matt this many  he puts up nine fingers  marisha youve grown up so well  matt thank you  marisha and i just give him a big hug  matt he freezes up hes gotten a little shy at the interaction  liam i kneel down next to him and i say do you want to see something cool look at this and i  take off the serpent belt and snake hisses  sam oh jesus  liam /none/ and i put him around my neck i named him after you  laughter  matt really  liam hes my pet do you want to hes gentle as a lamb do you want to tickle his neck  matt yes  laughter  liam yeah here you hold him i set it down around his neck dont worry nothings going to  happen its fine  matt he locks up again snakes and women have the same reaction to this poor little boy  liam simon fart in his ear go ahead and fart in his ear  matt /none/ he gives you a stern look and the snake just wraps around him for a second  marisha keyleth does a little wind gust and goes poof  matt he goes giggles and starts laughing reaches up and rubs his ear from the tickle  liam its good to see you again kiddo come here simon jr ill put him back now  matt he has a big smile on his face now thats so cool  laura while that was happening i pulled aside his mother is this everyone that made it  out of westruun  matt sighs /none/ well were one group many went to kymal but theyre at capacity now and based on  many of the farming fields that were destroyed or burned by the dragon ransacking theres only so  much food to go around so they had to turn us away but there were some small farming  communities along the river that were kind enough to take us in and were were getting by  laura but youre searching for a home  matt hoping to find out if anything takes care of the problems in westruun you should probably  talk to /none/ cornelius i dont know the details of everything happening  laura cornelius is he the man i saw in the finer robes  matt no no cornelius is rather hes not very welldressed he and she scratches her head  he used to be the bookbinder in westruun but when everything fell apart he rose up and took the  lead in keeping everyone safe and so i mean he wont say it but we kind of look to him as a  leader for now  laura did he work in the cobalt reserve  matt i think he /none/ did business with them but i dont think he worked directly with  laura oh okay  matt here let me take you  laura oh wonderful  matt she walks over and as you guys are talking to simon she scoops simon up and pulls him  to her side and gives you guys a smile of acknowledgement come and leads you guys  laura were meeting cornelius  sam okay  travis softly whos cornelius  laura hes a bookbinder  travis never heard of him  matt you guys are led through most of the folks stop /none/ what theyre doing and pay attention some  look wary and guarded others you see their faces brighten up as they begin to connect the dots  between the whispers theyve heard of vox machina throughout the landscape and the individuals  walking through most everyone seems to have a somewhat visceral emotional reaction once grog passes by it  does catch you you know as a person who has always stuck out against the society as it was  and youve worked hard to a degree to get some respect especially in that city having so many  eyes /town/ on you and you can feel the while unearned from your standpoint the heaps of hatred that are  thrust upon you by how you look right now is uncomfortable eventually the guards and elowen  bring you guys up to a central tent around what looks like a larger bonfire in the center where a  lot of people are starting to bring their big nets of fish over and starting to divvy it out and set  up small cooking arrangements so that people for the evening can have their dinner she walks up to  the edge /town/ of tent speaks to one of the guards mentions you guys and your wanting to talk to  cornelius the guard leans in shouts off to the side cornelius youve got some visitors is  that okay a voice muffles through thats fine go ahead and let them in the guard pulls open  the tent and at this point elowen says im going to go get my son some food if you need  anything just ask around  liam well see you again  matt thank you guys again she rubs simons head and walks off and as /town/ she walks off with him he keeps  looking over his shoulder at you the whole time with a big smile on his face you guys walk into  the tent and it smells like a tent thats been lived in for a couple weeks the interiors not  fancy by any means its blankets and burlap and whatever functions to guard against the relatively  muddy shores of the river and you get a sense that most places here just because of the  landscape and how close it is to the river mud is tracked everywhere so its /none/ mostly caked ground  there is a small cot on the far edge and there is a table set up and some elements of dried fish  that are just being pulled from a sack on the side and there are two guards and you can see  what appears to be cornelius coming to greet you as you enter a man in his mid40s blondish hair  with a scruffy unkempt beard you get the sense that hes a working man his hands look calloused  hes got a layer of just dirt and grime across his brow that /none/ tells you hes definitely one who gets  in the thick of it when its needed and you can see why in this circumstance people put trust into  a person that can rise up amongst all the chaos from simple means and prove themselves to want to  help everybody and in the moment he smiles you immediately see also why people follow him hes  got this bright toothy white smile and he puts his hand out immediately to each of you pleasure  to meet you im cornelius  laura vexahlia  matt so im told that /none/ you all are here to talk to me whats this about  sam we know that youve been driven out of your homes by an attack of dragon or dragons how many  have menaced your city  matt well counts all say that we have upwards of three dragons that came through here and tore  into this city and they were gone for a while and wed hoped they werent going to return but  thats when he kinda looks over to you grog thats when the savages came in and took what was  left and i /town/ mean no offense to that i recognize you ive seen you around the town before you  seem like youre not like your ilk  travis no no im sorry i dont know who you are  matt thats okay no one really knows who i am and i want to keep it that way when all this  blows over  travis understandable  matt dont like all the attention  taliesin how long have you been nomadic for  matt were going into our second week now i think we sent a few of our most ablebodied up /none/  north in hopes of trying to figure out if the city was safe to return to and well only a few made  it back and those that did said it was a bloodbath  laura its quite dangerous there right now  matt yeah  travis how many do you have here in your encampment with you  matt lets see he kind of takes a moment to think and does couple marks on the dirt in front  of him to do a count you can see hes not a very numbersguided person  travis i like /none/ him  laughter  matt id say we got probably about close to 60 70 people left we used to have more then we lost  the scouting parties up north and well these past four days weve had a few of these orcish  fuckers been raiding the outskirts of our camp every night and taking goods people  marisha whats your current destination  matt hah we got none were just staying here and staying alive  marisha and what made you camp out here  matt fish mainly i mean all the farming grounds are destroyed or /none/ theyre being guarded  currently and theres no space for us in kymal we can keep going east but  travis if i could be selfish for a moment have you seen wilhand pike pike trickfoot her  grandfather  laura a small older gnome  matt we got a few older gnomes from the city i dont think we have any among us though no  travis fine thought id ask  liam if we could help you relocate quite a ways away would you be open to that  matt how do you mean  laura theres a /none/ city a lot of the refugees from other cities that have been destroyed by the  dragons are finding their way there and  marisha percy actually has family whos in charge there  laura we could give you safe passage  taliesin possibly find you someplace to work  laura very quick safe passage  marisha can they account for 70 extra people in whitestone  taliesin we lost a lot during the attack with the briarwoods  marisha right  taliesin theres room but theres only we can maybe make room for a few more  laura theres /town/ farmland there are some empty buildings  matt i appreciate the offer and  marisha it hasnt been touched by dragons yet  matt hah yet  marisha yet  matt i tell you what we greatly appreciate the offer and were liable to take you up on that at  some point in the near future but right now we have too many of our people that are unaccounted  for to the south we got a couple scouting groups whore trying to find out where these orcs are  where theyve taken them see if we can retrieve /none/ our own before we go ahead and find a new place to live  sam how many are missing right now  matt well we lost 11 in the last few nights of exchange to blade and weve lost about nine to  the actual bands themselves so theres nine unaccounted for were hoping  sam if we found them would you be more likely to take your people to somewhere safe  marisha and what is necessarily stopping you from at least sending a handful of women and children  ahead families that dont need to be nomadic  /none/ matt do you have the means to keep them safe for that kind of travel thats a long way up to  whitestone we dont have the guards to keep them up on that  laura we have very safe means of travel  taliesin a shortcut one would say  marisha theyd be there in an instant  matt i dont know anything about any of that weird magic stuff but you seem like a reliable group  liam you can tell were a motley bunch of assholes weve seen shit and weve done shit and  we can /none/ do shit  matt aint that the truth well  taliesin wed also like to talk to you perhaps to see if youve seen some shit were actually  looking for something out here  laura oh  liam are we  taliesin we are well youve been travelling were looking for a creature who may have what we  need to help defeat these dragons  laura possibly a bit deeper into the frostweald  matt into the frostweald  taliesin yes  matt thats where were thinking our scouts are saying these orcs are holed up anyway  /none/ laura really  taliesin thats useful  matt at least thats where weve been sending our folk and follow them out there only one  group went in after them and they never came back so  marisha no ones returned whos come back  matt oh weve gotten one group that came back thats how we know theyre there but they were  just a scouting party they got to the outskirts and came back  marisha can we speak to them  matt i think theyre out right now actually going to get more information sorry  taliesin /none/ well that works out well then we can go up that direction perhaps take care of this  problem possibly  laura yes  taliesin its on the way  travis i wouldnt mind a good stretch  laura kill some orc  taliesin i could use some breathing  marisha do you know your way around the frostweald at all  matt cant say i do but i do have some stake in this personally if you dont mind me asking we  dont have much to offer you at all really other than my gratitude tell of a /none/ few friends of  ours thatve found their way wherever these savage creatures are stationed one of the individuals  that was taken in a raid two nights ago was my brother cyrus dont know if hes still amongst  the living but if you are indeed planning on taking a look at where these orcs are and bring  folks back safe if you could just keep an eye out for him  liam well ill tell you in times like these it will feel good to be able to do a bit of good  taliesin hear hear /none/  laura what does your brother look like  matt hes about 15 years younger than me shaggy brown hair bit of a puffy goatee he looks like a  lazy man he is a lazy man but i love him if youre looking for someone whos hiding in the  corner shaking in their boots its probably him  laura understood  travis check the corners  matt its his defense mechanism  laura laughs a very safe one  matt i hope his eyes go a little colder at that moment i hope  laura well weve been /none/ to the frostweald before im not afraid to go in there again  marisha no  taliesin i say we take the evening to rest and first thing in the morning head out  laura would there be any injured members of your camp that would want to head out in the morning to  whitestone somebody that needs any medical attention  matt weve got plenty of folks who arent feeling too well illness and disease  unfortunately tend to go handinhand with these type of nomadic lifestyles we can probably  about seven or eight people that could /none/ use some relatively immediate attention couple survivors  of the recent raids if you can indeed do this you might be saving some lives here  marisha are we camping the rest of the night  taliesin yes  liam thats wise  travis yeah we promise you no one will bother you tonight  marisha question question can i do my transport via plants as a ritual cast to not burn a slot  level  matt nope  marisha thats what i thought  matt it would say it next to the spell ritual  marisha thats what /town/ i thought okay keyleth spends the rest of the evening burning up my  remainder spell slots to do curing on those who need it  matt okay you guys are given a relatively ramshackle tent in which you can sleep for the  evening cooked fish thats about all they have to offer with a few leftover potatoes that  appear to have been recently either located amongst their remaining crates you have no idea  but a passable meal is presented if youd like and a place that has cloth over your head  travis no i dont /none/ need to sleep tonight ill be on the watch  sam boy  laughter  laura should we scour the camp for her grandfather  taliesin im sleeping tonight i dont know whats wrong with him  laura i know he said there were no gnomes but  travis theres only 60 people i feel like hed know with 60  laura yeah  travis thats like this many like  liam and its not a lot of gnomes im assuming its a handful of gnomes  travis yeah  laura right i just i dont know i wish pike /none/ were here  travis yeah me too  liam always wish pike was here  matt you do recall last time you were in whitestone you left the other half of your  gatestone with pike  taliesin ill write a letter  marisha well write a letter  taliesin ill write a letter that will travel with them to whitestone and  sam oh  marisha ooh thats a good idea  laura thats wonderful and she can pop over  taliesin mmhm take about a minute  travis really  marisha yeah  sam wait wed have to /none/ send them tonight though  taliesin no in the morning  laura they could go in the morning and just go find her immediately  marisha yeah could task someone to find her immediately and then as soon as she gets the  message shell beam to us  sam all right  liam ive still got the other one right here  travis great we take the night then  laura all right  taliesin i write a letter to my sister letting her know that i do apologize that were sending  more people but its necessary and /none/ i write her a letter insisting that pike be sent here by stone  immediately  matt okay  liam singing dear cass how are you im fine  laura what the fuck are you singing  taliesin singing everybody else is too  liam wow you know what im doing  travis holy shit what the fuck just happened  laura what was that  taliesin you are a nerd  liam a theatre nerd yeah  taliesin yeah you are a theatre nerd  laura wow  liam secret garden ladies and gentlemen  taliesin secret garden the /none/ musical its magical  liam can we have the break so taliesin and i can go make out in the other room  matt dont go on break for that just move your seating arrangement  taliesin and suddenly the youtube hits just go through the roof  laughter  sam what injured people are going back have we met these people yet can we meet them  matt you havent met them no  laura lets go find the injured  matt you guys are led with keyleth as well there are two armed guards that are hobbling their /none/ way  through their patrols tonight as theyve been wounded in the previous orc raid that happened the  couple nights beforehand there are a number of just relatively sick people couple of children  whether it be having to eat whatever was around to stay alive but some of the food had spoiled in  travel or just catching disease as when you have clusters of people in cold environments  especially cold wet environments like this tonight it does tend to happen nothing seriously  lifethreatening but you know definitely worrisome  sam i try to find the /none/ one whos the most ablebodied right were going to need someone to  go find pike or deliver a message right  laura yes  taliesin its going to be whoevers organizing it  sam is someone going whos not injured to transport these people  matt possibly and you can organize whoever youd like someone you know you could bring along  marisha well i start attending to the children first  matt okay so you tend to the children helping them feel comfortable deal with any wounds  scrapes relative inconveniences and its easy enough for you to /none/ take a moment to cure disease if  need be  laura can we find any families with children and maybe see if theres able bodies in there that we  could send through  matt okay yeah you manage to and with elowen and her son simon as well  laura yes maybe elowen could go  taliesin elowen would be perfect  marisha well remember we were able to get about 25 or so people through last time with the spell  laura how many sick people are there  matt you see about seven or eight people /none/ that could use it  laura perfect  matt so you can get a bunch of other folks through as well  marisha okay  laura i talk to elowen and ask if she can go find pike in the morning if she wants to go through  and all that kind of stuff  matt id be happy to i  sam you remember what pike looks like  matt yeah about your size lightish hair  sam hair the color of the sunset eyes like waves that crash in the night breasts supple firm  travis okay scanlan /none/ scanlan  ashley true true true  laughter  matt right yes i remember ill find her yes  sam smell of morning dew as it touches  matt she begins to cover simons ears  laughter  matt all right i think we should turn in for the evening but yes ill be happy to take care of it  liam also of note youre going to be going through a tree  matt what  liam just go with it youre going to be  marisha well you know you didnt have to tell them that now couldve /none/ just let it be a surprise  laura its really fun actually  liam its kind of frightening though if you dont know its coming  laura youll pop right out in whitestone its amazing  liam its still a little weird for me to be honest  marisha is it okay thats good to know  matt all right all right so as the evening comes to completion youre taking guard for the  course of the evening  laura i pop trinket out and i sleep on him  travis very attentive  matt bear sound he curls /none/ up  laura hugs and hugs  matt yeah warm fuzzy trinket makes for a very good bed for one  laura yes  liam im going to curl into the butt end which is all i get all i ever got while we were traveling  laura yeah he farts on you all the time  liam i fart on him all the time  matt its just a fart exchange back and forth forever  liam badalanglanglanglanglanglanglang  matt laughs that got weird did you want to do anything for the evening  travis no  matt okay /town/ make a perception check  sam oh boy  liam oh crud big two  travis big watch big watch  nine  laura eyoh  liam eyoh exploding sounds  matt okay all right the evening goes by without a hitch  groans  laura what would you have seen what would you have seen  matt you all come to consciousness you eventually get your rest as well for the evening  marisha what didnt you see tell me what you didnt see  matt at this point the tent city is back to a bustling sound of /none/ folks going about their business  for the day what kind of business that can be done the people that youve requested be sent  over to whitestone have been gathered on the outside the western side of this small city area  and some of the guards there are prepared to greet you in preparation for sending these people over  sam keyleth before we do this there are no trees here  marisha what what do you mean are there trees here  matt no its a plain i mean there are the occasional small tree scattered in /none/ clusters  around but youre in the grasslands  marisha i thought we were on the edge of a forest  sam theres no forest here  matt the forest is south of you guys  laura weve got to walk them to the forest  marisha how fucking far are trees  matt id say probably  sam four days journey  matt no from this area its most of a days travel there are trees closer but the forest is  that far  marisha i just need a tree to fit people through i need a personwidth /none/ tree  sam a giant tree  matt to find a tree large enough to do this is probably going to be about two hours walking  distance  laura okay we can walk for two hours  marisha thats a nice morning hike  laura you know what im going to fly up im going to hacking spit and fly up and find a  fucking tree  sam oh youre going to scout  laura im going to scout for a tree  matt all right go ahead and make a perception check  travis why did you /none/ pick that as the word  laura i didnt think about it i forgot  taliesin that was a great decision  laura 23  matt 23 you find actually hiding just around the bend of a series of small hills that butt up  against the southwestern side of the foramere basin there is a small cluster of trees one of  which is the largest of the group that may function as a function of this that is only about  a 30minute walk from these  marisha thats doable there we go  laura fly back down /none/ and i tell them i look along the path though and make sure its safe the  walking back is it okay  matt yeah  liam hopefully nobody saw the comely halfelf flying through the bright blue sky  laura i wear turquoise to blend in with the blue surroundings  matt you didnt blend in too well as when you crested over a number of the families and kids  that were prepared were pointing up mom shes flying people were excited to see you take off  into the distance it was quite a display well done /none/  laura i do some circles around and wave  liam maybe you can join dr dranzel in the circus  laura i hang off of it as i come down like woo and then come back up  matt go ahead and roll a dexterity check  laura dexterity or acrobatics  matt dexterity  laura damn it  travis outstanding  laura i said as i come down it was low i was low  matt so as vex takes a moment to do some unique tricks with her elaborate and longrunning  experience directing brooms across the /none/ sky she gets a bit cocky and does a look ma no hands  moment however in doing so the broom sputters out from under the grasp of her legs and suddenly  goes limp as it begins to fall almost as fast as you are as you both begin to plummet  laura i grab for it and hacking spit as im grabbing for it  liam you cant fight the power of the one  matt unfortunately you dont have any momentum to go forward and its already coasted about 15  20 feet away from you and /town/ theres nowhere to swim all the kids are like yay cheering and  all of a sudden you start falling and they go screaming and starts yelling  taliesin which child in the crowd is going to become robin im so excited  matt i want you to go ahead and roll an acrobatics check  taliesin this is how we make a vigilante  laura okay okay 25  matt 25 okay so you only suffer nine points of falling damage as you hit the ground and do a  tumble land arms out and catch the broom smiling /none/ amongst the serious pain in your legs and back  laura ill bet you thought i was really falling  matt all the kids are like yay and start cheering clapping even the parents start  clapping the guards start clapping like that was genuinely impressive played it off  travis blood trickles out of the ear from the brain trauma  laughter  sam does the broom just fall or does it shoot off like a missile  matt it shoots off for a second carrying the momentum of the propulsion and then it falls limp  as it /none/ no longer has the immediate connection with the person but she did catch it after she  tumbled  sam oh okay thats cool  taliesin working on it  laura im going to work on that trick you guys and its going to be amazing  taliesin i think its perfect  liam blood for the blood gods  matt all right finding the tree you guys walk and bringing the families and the children and the  people that were chosen to go to whitestone keyleth you create your transport via plants  spell whoosh the doorway opens /none/ and it barely fits onto this one halfdead willow thats  cresting the side there everyone gasps  marisha we form the line the ranks  liam climb through climb through you have to move quickly  marisha go go go go  matt at the very end elowens the last one through and shes holding the letter and she  looks back and says promise and leaps through right as it closes in the tree you look toward  the guards that were with you guys who are just watching this whole thing with their eyes wide  open /none/  travis glad you let us in arent you  matt yeah  marisha i turn to him and i go high five okay  matt at this point you see two figures walking towards you at this southern forest  sam two figures walking towards us  matt towards you guys rather hastily  sam i draw my whip  matt okay whips out you glance over and easy enough to see it is drez vina and this older  individual both rushing up drez has his hand up excuse me im sorry pardon me  taliesin yes hello /none/ hello  matt it has been some time everyone pleasure to see you again  laura we remember dear  matt wondrous wondrous im here with and as he gestures the old man puts his hand in front  and goes would you please just let me talk for once hello i am and he looks over has he  been giving you my i am master quall pleasure to meet all of you  sam quall  matt i was the collector that had hired you in previous times as drez has recently made me aware  and while /dung/ our track record has been spotty you seem to be rather ablebodied and whispers this  morning that have come to my ears mention that you have interest in returning to westruun is that correct  sam to set it free yes  matt wondrous wondrous he looks over to drez drez goes yes well you see the master here  lives within westruun and  im talking ive got this my abode which is a relatively humble  structure two stories bricks and dark wood southeast of the town square right by the  fountain crossroads im sure youve /none/ seen it before since this whole endeavor has happened it  has usurped a bit of progress in my experimentation and i would be remiss if i didnt  request your assistance in perhaps retrieving a very important piece of my collection so i might  continue this research in this desolate place  liam what are the subjects of your experimentation  matt various things i enjoy finding out the base elements of existence and life  laura insight check  matt insight check  laura hes lying 18  matt 18  taliesin god damn it  travis /none/ whispers  sam dagger dagger dagger is one of the shirts thats available theres strongjaw ale strongjaw  ale available for sale check it out geek and sundry  taliesin thats very interesting did you know that im a collector as well actually  matt really oh quaint  taliesin of specifics  matt of what  taliesin specifics i see that you have not really handed any over  matt it may be a bit beyond your understanding  laura very few things are beyond his understanding  matt very well i appreciate the synergies between various elements and /none/ the ability to link  the essence with that of a living organic entity or the transition of such living essence into what  is normally nonliving matter  marisha so youre a necromancer  matt no i dont deal with that ridiculous stuff  taliesin hes talking about transmutation of some kind  matt yes yes thank you the transitioning of essences or sparking essence within what was once  nonliving matter im talking about elements im not talking about flesh  marisha like natural elements  laura like golems  taliesin its the veganism of necromancy its just /dung/ kind of dull  matt what was that  taliesin nothing  matt now i had previously asked you to retrieve an item in the past that was part of this  research and i was nearing a breakthrough i believe however if you could find your way into  this abode and retrieve for me its in the basement amongst my work desk area its a simple  dark iron and cobalt circlet a band if you will if you could retrieve that for me i would make it  quite worth your while and be evergrateful and in /none/ your service  liam what are we talking about a pile of coin or something else  matt as i said before i am quite the collector and while i do hate to relinquish my grasp on  various parts of this collection for someone who does me a grand favor i am willing to look the  other way as one might disappear  laura what does the circlet do  matt its more of an experimental piece  liam come on dont treat us like a bunch of fucking assholes its in the middle of shit right  /none/ now were not going to go in there for a trinket its obviously something very worthwhile you  would have a better chance with us if youre honest  matt drez at this point steps forward and goes i would appreciate if you respected the master  for his research he is going to offer you a great guide  marisha oh shut up drez  liam yeah youre an asshole youre the biggest asshole im not talking to you im talking to  you im not talking to you im talking to you  matt sir perhaps we need /none/ to at which point he looks over and the masters like cackling  about time someone called you on it  sam master quall were looking for the vestiges of divergence  laura scanlan what the fuck  sam oh am i not supposed to say that do you know where those are thats what we want if you  can offer us one of those well do business with you otherwise were going to fuck off  marisha wait he might look master quall finish what you were saying first  matt yes ive heard of this title before /none/ you say youre seeking them are you  sam i am not them  matt where are you seeking these whereabouts are you off to  marisha well we were headed towards  sam we dont know where they are  laura theyre all sorts of different places were trying to figure that out right now were  not exactly sure were not exactly sure keyleth  sam we thought you might know  marisha how is what were seeking less important than where were seeking it im really confused  travis oh you know just in case we mention /none/ where we might be looking for them in front of  these people  laura because what if he goes to find them  matt dont worry  marisha does he look like the man capable of going and finding things hes trying to send us  back into his own god damn basement to get his own shit  matt see there is a woman who speaks both her mind and a mind of quite acute truth  sam she is cute  laura is it morning yet can pike come join us yet  sam she is being /none/ sought  matt as you guys are having this conversation theres a little crackling flash of divine  energy before you and a slight popping sound as out of the middle of the air next to you there  comes jogging in a freshly winded fully armored pike  sam what an entrance  taliesin see you start arguing and you just make a gnome this is what happens  travis i run over and i pick up pike and i spin her around in a big bear hug  ashley hey grog  travis oh my little buddy pike /none/ we missed you  ashley oh i missed you guys  marisha hi pike  ashley hey guys oh who are these two  matt at this point master quall is going through a series of notes he goes im very certain this  gnome was not created  marisha and you remember drez  ashley oh yes mr vina drez vina  matt yes it is a delight to see you as well small one  ashley hi  matt well this grew very complicated  taliesin master quall  matt yes  taliesin lets lay the cards on /none/ the table if we find this thing of yours in your basement and if  we go to your home we are certainly going to go into the basement and find it now regardless  were going to figure out what it is before we give it to you anyway the world is dangerous  right now and it is not appropriate to just be handing mystical artifacts of great strength  willynilly to anybody who asks the world is dangerous and we need to make sure that power is  flowing in the correct direction now you can either /none/ be forthright with that and get your  property or we can find it in your basement and experiment on it until we know what it is  matt good luck even attempting such an endeavor  taliesin i have very good luck attempting these endeavors  matt well lets just say that its a device that when completed to the specialty of my own  training and studies would enable me the means of personal defense to get me through these rather  difficult and dangerous times as i am not getting any younger and it seems that were /none/ having  entities of great power and mischief intent on destruction continuously tearing down my very  doorways he looks off in the direction of westruun i would feel more comfortable if i  could keep myself well guarded and that is what this circlet is intended to provide  laura tell you what master quall  matt yes  laura were not heading there now but well be going back and when we do we will find your  home and we will search out this circlet  sam well hold on before we just say no whats the /dung/ reward do we know what youre paying for this  taliesin well hes got a collection  matt a simple trade of my collection you bring me one of my items and i gift you one of mine as well  taliesin i personally feel this is reasonable  marisha im curious if you could be more beneficial in paying us with  information with knowledge  laura as well as something from your collection  matt i am more than willing to offer information for trade it is quite a grand trade indeed if  that is acceptable  /none/ laura no we would want something as well physically  taliesin this is a deposit of information  matt all right then as part of the deposit what do you require of me  marisha are you familiar with a sphinx named osysa  matt cant say that i am  marisha resides up no  taliesin what does he know perhaps of the no  marisha are you familiar with any other sphinxes that reside in this area do you know the address  matt im sorry but they dont really wander in open daylight  laura do you /none/ know where they wander  taliesin in darkness if they dont wander in open daylight  matt he gives a curious look at both of you i am not a master of mythology i do not know of  such entities and where they might reside or exist i apologize  marisha well you do seem to be a master of items we are looking for certain special vestiges  matt so you say and youre saying this sphinx may want to help you in this endeavor  marisha were not sure yet  taliesin its a long walk  /town/ marisha we thought maybe he could help us find them but maybe you could be of a similar service  matt well what i do have and he turns around come with me to my tent please i may  have something that can be of service to you  marisha sure  laura i give pike a hug as we walk to his tent  sam actually i pull pike aside and say well not aside i just ask her hows whitestone  whats going on there  ashley well its okay i think i got to the point /town/ where i couldnt build anymore heal any  more people i needed a little adventure but everything is as you would think it would be  sam no dragon attacks  ashley none at the moment weve been trying to hold down the place as much as we can and getting  there seems to be okay  liam i did not go up to pike i hung way the fuck back  matt all right you guys eventually make your way back to the small outpost at this point to  the tent of drez vina and master quall /none/ master quall steps inside you hear him rummaging through  some things something rolls and breaks and you hear oh damn it from the inside he comes  back out and goes all right so this and he holds up this small glass bauble the inside has a  spinning looks like a brass gyroscopetype interior he goes this item when clasped and  concentrated on should light up any sort of nearby magical incantations or enchantments this  if you are in the presence of such objects as you are seeking should be quite helpful in locating  their /none/ presence it does not have an incredibly long range but it should at the very least be  somewhat helpful  laura thats pretty cool  sam youre giving this to us  matt im lending it to you should you wish this to be part of the trade instead of something from  my collection  laura no no no lending is  taliesin lending is perfectly agreeable  matt now i have lent you something in the past and not only did it not return to me but i had to  extract the funds by forcing another /none/ contract on you can i trust you to complete this endeavor  sam you can trust us as far as grog can throw me  travis pretty fucking far  taliesin you can trust her  matt deal and he hands it out  travis we will make our way into the city and when we do we will look for your items  matt thank you i appreciate that  sam or we could just send vex on a broom right now to get it solo  marisha wait what what  taliesin we are not flying a halfelf /none/ into the city on a broom that she has already fallen off of  in the last 24 hours  liam archers  laura i am recovering a bit right now but thank you for the wonderful wonderful idea scanlan  sam i think you can do it i think you can do it  laura thank you i appreciate the vote of confidence  liam he is a tactician  marisha hey what might this item be called sir quall  matt i havent named it actually i made it for myself call it what you like  sam /town/ how about the hunk of quall  marisha the hunk of quall  matt should you wish certainly  taliesin didnt we had a conversation about letting him name things  i feel like we had this conversation  travis always do it right  matt enjoy carrying among yourselves the hunk of quall  travis thank you drez vina it hasnt been a pleasure nice to see you  matt drez crosses his arms indeed all right good luck  travis and can i take pike around the shoulder and lead her out of the tent  matt yeah /none/  travis hey hey hey pike  ashley yeah  travis so im glad things have been good at whitestone theyve been good yeah  ashley yeah theyve been all right i mean its okay ive been missing you guys though  travis yeah we miss you a whole lot listen ive got some rough news actually we made it  back to westruun and the city has kind of been ransacked and overtaken it was attacked by a  bunch of dragons and whats worse is that after it was attacked you know that herd of wandering  goliaths /none/ that left me for dead in the woods  ashley of course  travis yeah theyve kind of taken control of the city and i think thats my family thats in there  ashley oh no  travis yeah look we wanted to go in i wanted to look for wilhand but we havent done it yet and  ashley have you heard anything else do you think they are okay  travis i dont know some of us went in via mist and they havent seen him but they dont really  know what he looks like the place /none/ looks pretty rough hes not here in this little encampment  im not really sure where he is  ashley okay well i wonder if we should go look for him  travis yeah i want to but like listen im afraid to put everybody in the group in jeopardy  theyre going to be there in the city and i was wondering what you might think about going to look  for a few

find wilhand  ashley okay  travis all right  matt all right  sam so is the task then to go find the orcs that are keeping their people  hostage up in the frostweald  laura we head into the frostweald we /none/ find the orcs and send them back and keep going and find  this sphinxy mate  marisha did we have any other information of where he is in the frostweald  or do we just know frostweald  laura we just know frostweald pike  matt the information that you received was somewhere in the base of the stormcrest mountains  past the frostweald  marisha past the frostweald  liam through it to the base of the mountain  laura of the what mountain  matt stormcrest mountains  liam thats a real place  travis actually pike /none/  ashley yeah  travis ive been holding on to something and i think you might like it i have these gauntlets of  ogre power and i cant wear them anymore because i got some new stuff and if you wear it your  strength score goes up to 19  ashley what  travis do you want them you have to attune to them  ashley do you think theyll fit  travis i think they might shrink i dont know though  taliesin do you know what 19 means  travis isnt it like a french dish /none/  laura yes  ashley i would love to wear those  travis all right and i give pike the gauntlets of ogre power  matt as you guys take a short rest to prepare for this ashley you take some time with the  gauntlets and while youre looking them over and taking your own armored gauntlets off and  replacing them with these your hand goes its like placing a baseball into a bucket its so big  around your arm but then as you take a moment to see the metal and reflect upon it you can /none/ feel  the hum of magical energy that begins to invisibly intertwine with your forearm as the metal begins  to creak almost and it shrinks down encases itself to your forearm while it doesnt match the  metal of your armor the silvergold theme that goes on along it with this weird ogreish face  thats built into the plate there you feel suddenly this surge of strength begin to spill  through your body and youre pretty confident that this may be useful in the near future  laura youre stronger than grog now  matt you are /none/ technically now stronger than grog  ashley i let out a little battle cry battle cry  travis yeah and i go to give her a fist bump  ashley i fist bump him  matt and it hurts you a little bit  laura oh shit pike is so strong  travis holy shit nice pike  matt pike what was your strength before  ashley 13  matt okay at a 19 youre now at a plus four as opposed to a plus one to all your hit and damage  with your physical weapons  liam you /none/ just tyler durdened out son  matt so on your sheet where it has your attack bonus with your mace or with your morningstar  and the damage add a plus three to both the attack bonus and damage  ashley all right because right now my attack bonus is plus seven so i add three to that  matt its now plus ten  laura holy moley  marisha thats so cool youre a beast  liam little golden bullet  ashley i cant find a pencil thats okay ill make a note i can do it later i /none/ am unprepared  yes i am unprepared for all this strength  travis right so now we have all our stuff should we make our way towards that area they said  that the orc raiders were coming from  sam yeah its a couple days from here  matt on foot travel its about a day and a half  sam for mist form  matt mist form youll get there by nightfall  laura but we cant use it because she already used the travel through the trees  marisha sorry  laura but we saved all those /none/ people scanlan  sam pike can you make us mist  ashley no i cant do anything like that  sam all right  laura lets walk  ashley i feel like i havent spent any time with vax  sam with vax oh hes around you know hes probably just sulking  liam i walk away  matt you glance back and see vax towards the back of the group noticing this conversation vax  immediately turns around and walks away and dodges around one of the nearby tents  liam big nope to that one  travis what /none/ is the weather like outside  matt actually today its spotty clouds but blue sky its actually pretty good weather versus a  lot of the rain that you had over in vasselheim  travis cold snowy on the ground  matt no because youre getting a little further south than the northern area of it the  temperature is probably around high 70s low 80s  laura it is going to get cold though once we head into the frostweald we had all those fancy  cloaks i had winters cloaks for all of us before  travis i /dung/ still have mine  laura does everyone still have their winters cloaks from a long time ago  marisha i do  taliesin oh wow yes look at that  sam i didnt burn it  travis lets go  sam were just going to walk do these refugees have any horses or anything  laura theyre refugees  matt the few horses they do have are currently quartered to wagons and look to be more beasts of  burden for if they have to move to carry most of their goods with them as opposed to riding horses  /none/ travis come on man lets just hoof it  sam all right well walk  marisha oh my gosh are we walking we havent walked anywhere in so long  liam its like were back in new york again  marisha its like were level three again  matt and those horses will survive because you didnt take them  travis oh thats fucked up  laura thats really sad  travis take a walk save a horse  matt thats a good vox machina bumper sticker  taliesin my other horse is walking  travis coming to the geek /none/ and sundry store  matt all right you guys make your fellowship trek southward with the sweeping camera drone shot  laura i constantly keep an eye out for anything in the front of us and behind us  matt thankfully most of these fields of varying degrees of grass height but for the most part  its pretty wide vision of where youre heading  marisha i paint pictures in the clouds as we go  laura oh thats good thatll definitely not let anyone know magical people are on their way  taliesin just point arrows in the /none/ opposite direction  travis graffiti as we go  ashley can i insightcheck vax  matt sure roll an insight check  ashley natural 20  matt i believe you  marisha this never happens  sam you just saw all of his dirty dreams  matt what does she see and read on your face and body language vax  liam i got to say this  matt i can say it if you want to  liam i dont want these assholes to know what im thinking i dont know cant whisper it to her  matt you /none/ can text it to her real fast if you want  liam yeah ill text it to you  laura but put it on twitter so that everybody else knows what it is  liam no  ashley ill post it  matt okay so youll have an incoming text of information as you guys continue walking these  are the observations you make of vax as you travel southward you travel for the better part of a  day you get quite a bit south you do see in the distance a few times what appear to be some /none/ pack  animals some larger beasts that roam the land none that are necessarily aggressive unless you  encroach upon their territory and keyleth you have experience with some of these beasts so you  manage to keep people at bay and traverse around what they claim as their own landscape no  terrible detriment to your traveling speed you make your way to the point where the sun goes  down you can stop and camp for the night or you can push through the evening what do you wish to do  marisha are there any trees nearby /none/  matt little periods here little tiny groves that might be spotty along your journey but for the  most part its open fields  marisha how much further do we have do you think  matt one more day one more eighthour period of travel  laura we should probably rest then right well be hitting the frostweald at night tomorrow  taliesin were not in a rush  laura not anymore the dragons are bunkered down i believe  taliesin everything we do now is measured in weeks and months and not days  laura and i still /none/ have a little dried blood on the outside of my ear i could use a bit of rest  taliesin actually yeah do you have a concussion is that something that we can how  many fingers am i holding up  laura youre really blurry percy i have no idea  travis nine  matt save versus brain swelling are you guys setting up camp  laura i want to pull my brother aside when we set up camp  sam do we want camp or do you want to sleep in a mansion  laura pike hasnt seen /none/ your beautiful mansion  marisha oh you have to show her the marble floors  taliesin do we want to do it now or do we want to do it tomorrow night is the question  sam we can do it both  laura oh thats right we can do it both nights  sam i can do it every day right  ashley where do you have a mansion  laura scanlan has a mansion pike  sam i inherited some money its a long story there was a greatuncle vesuvius  taliesin also known as uncle touchy uncle /dung/ nono  liam canon thats canon  sam the court said that he had to give me no well sleep in the mansion tonight and they all  know where theyre sleeping but ill personally show pike to her chambers which are right next  door to mine at the end of the long hallway my room obviously the biggest tallest pikes a  close second beautiful covered in yellow rose petals as far as you can see  matt so pike as scanlan creates this somewhat shimmering door of mystical energy in the middle  of the air off /none/ of the path you guys have been walking in the middle of this field its just  the open grass thats blowing with this gentle night breeze a little bit of the moonlight is  coming through the clouds giving enough of a visual of this change in the air space he pushes  open the shimmering door and on the inside is this beautiful mansion tall foyer with marble  floors pillars that raise to the ceiling with gold trim theres a giant portrait in the center  of the main stairway now that has both scanlan and you /none/ on horseback over a beautiful landscape there  are a number of mystical servants that are somewhat transparent and spiritual arcane energy  in form that take your coats and offer food a delicious meal is presented for all of you  sam mostly chicken  matt its mostly chicken its a lot of chicken  laura im having a lot of talk with the servants about different ways to prepare food  sam please do  taliesin they keep clucking it up  matt protein bro scanlan does lead you to your room which is right next to his /none/ and covered in  yellow rose petals a beautiful interior the color scheme is marked tailored specifically to  your tastes that hes been able to glean from conversations with you over the past couple years  sam blues silvers theres a little mini prayer area for her to pray to sarenrae and theres a  little statue of sarenrae and if you pull it a little secret door opens to my room but its a  small door that only a gnome could fit through  ashley oh great is there a lock on that maybe  laughter  /none/ sam only on my side  ashley okay oh this is beautiful scanlan  sam i did it for you and hey while we have a moment alone can i just mention something to you  listen im not really concerned with other peoples vices or bad behaviors but grog has this  sword and its sort of not good it could be used for good possibly but im just worried about it  just keep an eye on it i dont know what it is and maybe you could just check it out next time  youre friending it /none/ up with him  ashley okay when they had that fight with percy up in the house i felt like there was something  weird with that sword ill check it out  sam i dont want to judge him or what he does but just make sure that it wont kill any of us  thats all i care about  ashley yeah thats a good plan okay i will thanks scanlan  sam sleep tight and if you hear any footsteps in your room its not me  its the servants i assure you  laura can i /none/ find is there a library in the mansion scanlan  sam of course  laura can i pull my brother into a library or something i just want to talk to you  liam what what  laura okay weirdo i couldnt help but notice anywhere pike was you were not all day today  and i have a feeling its because  liam you want to talk  laura yes i do dont walk away from me please i have a feeling its because of this raven queen  situation i dont know i know that you offered yourself /none/ to her to save me and i cant put into  words how much that means to me im worried that she took you up on the offer and i know youre  worried about it too and im afraid thats why youre avoiding pike youre afraid shes going to  see something in you but i wanted to tell you ive been looking through this book its the best  35 gold ive ever spent maybe it was 30 gold i dont even remember anymore  liam it was 30  laura it was 30 it would have been /none/ worth 35 for all the things that i found in it look its got  all this information about the raven queen and ive been looking at it all the time i dont  think shes as horrible as youre afraid she is can i tell you what i found  liam yes please  laura it says that those that follow her must hold no pity for those who suffer and die for  death is the natural end of life thats not bad bring down the proud who try to cast off the  chains of fate as /none/ the instrument of the raven queen you must punish hubris where you find it  bring down those who try to cast off the chains of fate the raven queen represents death right  therefore she hates those that live an immortal life she hates vampires we hate vampires  theyre terrible people right thats not bad watch for the cult of orcus and stamp them out  whenever they arise orcus is bad if she hates him then she must not be that terrible  liam shes already speaking to me  laura oh and  liam i dont /none/ know vexahlia i dont know what this means i know that shes not a force for  evil neither are funeral homes i dont want to bed down in one  laura well thats understandable  liam but it doesnt matter and id do it again because i did it for you and i am trying to come  to terms with it not knowing the terms  laura well weve lived half our life in the shadows youve made them your home am i right  liam maybe so  laura this is a time you can either let /none/ those shadows swallow you down and keep falling into a  hole or you can use them to your advantage you can become a champion its pretty fucking badass  if you ask me  liam do you know how bad this armor smells  laura i can smell it actually pretty terrible  liam its several centuries old its not pleasant  laura maybe we can get you some oils or something to put on it  liam maybe  laura what im saying is brother im proud of you and im happy for you and im so so /none/  thankful for you and you dont need to be frightened this is a wonderful thing not many  fucking people can say theyre a champion of a fucking god  liam listen ill take what you say under consideration again none of us you and i dont  know what this means im waiting to see  laura all right but as someone whos seen the other side and has come back thanks to you  theres no use living your life in fear i love my reckless brother as much as he hurts my heart i  love /none/ you for that and dont be afraid to be that  liam i have no clever answer to give you  laura thats wonderful i love you and i walk away  laughter  liam i go to bed  taliesin before scanlan disappears i grab him as hes leaving  sam im just making the rounds make sure everyones tucked in for the night  liam scanlans like wasnt looking in on pike wasnt looking in on pike  taliesin have you perhaps installed some sort of workspace in this wonderful home of yours for  me ive got /none/ a few little projects i want to poke at  sam you mean the allpurpose room  laura the room of requirement  taliesin im a little worried by what allpurpose necessarily means  sam dont look in there with a black light  taliesin its not really a work table is it  liam it is the danger room  sam its all purposes percy all purposes but yes it is a private room no one can hear you  scream in there its the farthest wing we have i can give you some servants to help you set /none/  something up bring in some tables whatever we dont have much in here were not prepared for  chemical reactions  taliesin nothing complicated just some very basic blacksmithing and a little bit of  leatherwork  sam do i have that stuff anything to help him  matt yeah if it was prepared within the house  sam i tried to make enough stuff for all of us to have our basic needs met  taliesin i can think of some very sexy things that can be done with an anvil think about it  sam all my /none/ anvils are gnomesized  taliesin thats comical  marisha keyleth pops her head out into the hallway did i hear something about working are  you working  taliesin yes scanlans helping me find a room that apparently is so soundproof we dont  actually have to hear anyone elses drama  marisha oh thats fantastic  taliesin i know grab a book itll be fun  marisha i might join you  sam are you going to have a working dinner ill send some chickens down  marisha i cant sleep so yes  travis what about cows  /none/ taliesin no cows in my room either please  marisha i join percy and help him  matt okay you guys find the allpurpose room which does have the basics required for smithing  the smithing gear that is brought to you by the servants in itself is very very finely crafted  and nearly weightless its really impressive and you look at the label and it has a small timer on  it before it becomes immaterial  taliesin i can work with materials that are in the bag of holding that are real materials as  long as /none/ i put them back in the bag of holding and take them with me i cant leave anything  obviously  matt yeah anything you leave in here will just be spat out  taliesin oh itll just be spat out thats lovely  matt yeah onto the ground where it was  taliesin for the moment because i dont have everything i need for the broom yet i want to  work on a piece of jewelry if thats okay i want to work on the thing  matt work on jewelry  taliesin i want to construct a /none/ little piece of jewelry if thats okay not magical  matt do you have a jewelers kit  taliesin do i have a jewelers kit  matt its a whole different skill set man  taliesin i cant tinker something  matt you can tinker something but jewelry is different from tinkering  taliesin no well this is a piece that has purpose it actually is going to be a functional  object  matt what is the function of this object you need to tell me these things  taliesin i know this is something that i im so /none/ sorry  matt im going to make something make me roll for it i got to know what youre doing  taliesin i want to make a im so sorry im losing the word  marisha hey percy what are you trying to make  taliesin something thats too complicated to explain to you im blanking on it i may have to  just give you the name at the break a little herb pouch like one of those cages that close up to  put herbs in them  sam oh like you make tea with  matt okay /none/ it wont be pretty but you can make it functional yeah go ahead and make  a tinkering check  taliesin all right ill make it pretty later  liam like a shoprite bag with a bunch of shit in it  matt this will be a dexterity mod because its not a very complicated piece based on what youve  constructed in the past its more about your ability to make it work  taliesin dexterity thank god because thats a terrible roll 14  matt 14 okay it takes you the better part of the night  marisha /none/ do i assist him at all  matt with a job this small theres not a whole lot you can assist with except handing him tools  taliesin im not going to run the whole night at some point im going to be like i dont have the  design yet this is something i want to get right so this is going to be working towards it  matt okay so you get the first stage of that set and ready to go  taliesin i cant think of the name of what it is im so embarrassed  /none/ matt you all eventually find yourselves to rest tasks completed to the extent of which you wanted  to conversations finished you find yourselves at breakfast a delightful spread of breakfast  chickens prepared for you  marisha i pick one up off the table and i say hey vex whoosh  laura shit im not even on my grunt  matt all of you duck instinctively as the chicken has enough time to arc and begin to plummet down  before she gets her arrow out and you see her aiming downward as it falls as she releases the /none/  arrow it manages to catch it go ahead and roll for an attack see how well it hits  laura oh thats good 30  matt arrow impact  laura oh wait 28 28  matt slightly quieter arrow impact  it pins the chicken to the wall and then it just sags the wooden shaft slowly snaps under the  weight of the chicken before it hits the ground one of the servants scoops it up and sets it back  on the table in front of keyleth with the broken arrow shaft sticking out  marisha i /none/ like that game its my new favorite game  liam do you want some more broom target practice  laura i need to practice with this broom  liam you do need to practice seriously  marisha we have more chickens  travis weve got stuff to do  laura yeah we have stuff to do  liam im still eating i would love to see you for five minutes get up on that broom and fly  around and fucking put some arrows in some chickens  laura all right fine ill fucking practice does it help me at /none/ all to practice on this broom  liam it helps me  sam i will command seven servants to each have a loaded chicken at the ready  liam pull  laura i start flying  sam vax you can do the honors and say the pulls  laura i clench really hard with my thighs to try to hold on to this broom  matt as the rest of you enjoy what is the strangest of medieval times experiences youve  had glancing upward to the raised ceiling of this dining room area you watch vex spiral around on /none/  her broom before scanlan  sam vax is saying pull  liam pull  taliesin chicken clucking  matt roll with disadvantage  laura oh jesus okay  travis say it say it  laura one  taliesin easiest number to count to  matt so as the first chicken goes in the air she reaches and goes to aim however she catches  herself the broom throws her off and she stops just in time and haphazardly focuses on just the  chicken not realizing where the chicken had now fallen past releases it scanlan i want you /none/ to  make a dexterity saving throw  sam nine  matt go ahead and roll damage  laura okay thats not that bad damage oh its automatic hit  matt yeah  laura okay oh no  liam full damage  laura thats 17  matt so scanlan as youre watching this chewing suddenly impact  sam screaming  laura shit scanlan scanlan im so sorry i land i land i land and i instantly cast cure  wounds on him fuck im sorry im sorry im sorry  matt a big old chicken dangling at the end of /none/ the arrow  laura pike pike help help help help  travis im just applauding again again i pick up my chicken and i throw it at scanlan  taliesin does this mean when the nights over theres going to be a little pool of blood where  the door was  matt youll find out go ahead and roll for healing  laura oh god okay  matt as vex reaches out and grasps you and manages to heal some of your wounds  laura oh good thats good its just 1d8 do i add anything  matt 1d8 /none/ plus your wisdom modifier  laura 11  matt so you heal 11 hit points  sam can i pull out the arrow  matt sure a gout of blood sprays out  laura i hold my hand there pike can you help  ashley ill help ill help that broom is amazing  marisha isnt it pike  ashley yes and there are too many chickens in here anyway healing scanlan  matt pike youre just casting a cure wounds  ashley yes ill cast cure wounds  matt the wound closes as pike reaches out and with a /none/ small chuckle heals how many hit points  liam the chicken comes back to life  ashley what did you say matt  matt how much do you heal roll 1d8 plus five im pretty sure that was amazing  laura sorry scanlan you can blame my brother  ashley nine  sam im back  matt youre back to full the wounds close pikes there holding her hands on your shoulders  closing the wound  sam thank you pike  ashley youre welcome  sam all right well lets say breakfast is over  laura im going to /none/ practice a bit more you guys  matt the other servants are holding their chickens at the ready  sam pull  marisha go go go  ashley can i try punching one in the air with my new gauntlets  matt okay as hes about to throw it up pike runs over and grabs the chicken and throws it and  boom punches it in the air pike roll a strength check roll a d20 and add plus four to it  liam 20 chicken mcnuggets fly through the air  ashley this is so dumb why am i /none/ doing this what am i doing  matt roll a d20 add four to it  liam for the greater good  ashley okay its not that high 11  matt 11 okay you boom bat it up with a pike punch well say for the sake of brevity on this  go ahead and roll one more attack and this will count for the rest of the shots with  disadvantage  laura oh come on 16  matt 16 okay you do manage to recover your sense of selfesteem as you manage to pin a couple  more /none/ chickens against the walls and the table in here but each arrow is just a reminder of the one  stray that began this whole breakfast excursion  laura sorry about that scanlan  sam great job vex  marisha guys this is the best brunch weve ever done  liam i will never forget it  marisha that was great thank you for that scanlan  sam sure sure  laura we should probably get a start on a walk  marisha yeah so question before we leave you guys  taliesin this is going to make the archery /none/ booth at renn faire hilarious sorry okay carry on  marisha do we want to travel via wind walk or are we okay  sam were only eight hours away  taliesin its only eight hours save your strength  marisha because i can save my strength  laura yeah yeah save it  marisha okay all right thank you  laura we might come across some orcs  marisha thats true  travis hopefully shit  laura i know right i could use some  sam all right lets set out  matt you guys say goodbye to your /none/ servants gather yourselves as you step out and the door  closes behind you do you choose to leave the spell up or are you going to fade it as you walk along  sam if i leave it up can anyone go in there  matt anyone that you allow into it  taliesin i want to see if the blood comes out  sam no ill shut the door and hide the key under a rock  matt okay you guys continue walking southward towards the frostweald about another seven to  eight hours of travel along that /none/ way you begin to see the stormcrest mountains in the distance get  closer and loom larger and larger and you get the feel of the stormcrest mountains especially  because there is a very large storm surge that seems to rise from the ocean to the east of it  that has caused a very heavy thunderstorm thats blasting through you cant see the peaks of the  mountains from this distance there are clusters of trees and forest areas along but ahead of you  you can see coated in a very very bright visibly white forest this /none/ is the frostweald  itself with snowfall once again youve been here before and there is an essence and you  dont recall the specific reason for it but there is a purpose an ancient purpose as to why this  one area is perpetually sitting in the heart of winter amongst what is a relatively temperate in  some places almost tropical temperature layer it is very strange and part of the mystical calling  to the frostweald is that it is perpetually locked in a winter state you dont worry im working  on it  marisha keyleth /none/ takes a second to meditate on the previous time that we were here in the frostweald  and i cast find the path 6thlevel spell which gives me the most direct shortest route as long  as im on the same plane existence of where im going if i have a vague idea of where im going  matt where are you going  sam were going to the stormcrest mountains right  marisha were trying to get to the stormcrest mountains through but were also looking for the  band of orcs travelling  matt if you name a /none/ destination on another plane of existence a destination that moves or a  destination that isnt specific such as a green dragons lair the spell fails  marisha but were in the frostweald right  matt yes youre approaching it now  marisha is the frostweald considered on a different plane  matt no but do you have a specific location that youre familiar with that you want to go to  marisha well i can find us the shortest most direct route to the stormcrest mountains  sam have we been there  matt yeah you can see them /none/ im trying to figure out for the spell to work you have to choose a  specific location that youre already familiar with to lead you to it  marisha right  matt so what are you saying  marisha stormcrest mountains but just because i can see them doesnt necessarily mean were going  to find the most direct path shortest direct path towards it  matt thats true  marisha right or is this a waste of a spell and i should just do something else  matt i will give you the benefit to say that you /none/ can see the mountain range this is more useful if  its trying to find a place that youre very familiar with seen a picture of or you had a  very specific bit of information for it for a general location or a location that youre unaware  of the spell wouldnt have an effect  laura maybe you could think of the location of her mate the sphinxs mate  marisha i dont know it so it fails thats why i was trying to do stormcrest mountains but  apparently thats not specific enough  laura well is /dung/ it specific its just we can see them  liam yeah its right there  matt its a large range thats very visible  liam lets move on lets move on  marisha ill do something else  taliesin save it for something special  matt so as you guys press forward to the outside of the frostweald the snow and icecovered  treeline is a very familiar sight from your last time traveling here there are canopies of  pinelike trees that interlock with windless snowfall that leave a fairly dark interior set  from the frozenover canopy slick /none/ surfaces and kneedeep snowbanks permeate this entire forest  region your breath is immediately visible as you step past that threshold and the temperature  drops about 40 degrees from what it was before getting steadily colder the further in you travel  laura bet youre glad you have that beard now huh keeps you warm no  travis its actually quite nice out here this is like spring for me  liam are your people did you grow up in the cold  travis yeah were pretty cool  liam wow  matt pressing in as the temperature drops /none/ further and further you occasionally come across  a broken sunbeam that manages to penetrate aspects different places in the canopy and even  stepping into those they dont lend any change in temperature or warmth the enchantment that  surrounds this entire forest doesnt seem to be moved by such natural incursions everyone go  ahead and roll a perception check  laura 25 are we in the woods 29  travis two  marisha 18  taliesin 15  sam 20  ashley 25  matt as you guys are walking through keeping your eyes peeled vax youre /none/ so lost in thought  that your eyes glaze over for a second and you forget where you are pike and vex the two of you  get a little bit ahead of the rest of the group pushing through the snow you come around from a  tree and you can see this is about an hour or so into your entrance to the frostweald you see a  small clearing with a few patchy trees outside of the heavy canopy and what appears to be a couple  of small stone ruins and a single obelisk a monolithlike /none/ pillar of stone that juts out of the  snow its about 200 feet away from you guys 250 feet  laura can we see anything around it any people any trace of tracks in the snow  matt from this distance no you dont see any there are no figures there is no movement there  is just that stone piece that at a slight angle stands out amongst the rest of the treeline  travis what do you see  laura theres a look theres a fucking obelisk its a tall stone thing grog  travis yeah so /none/  sam lets go over  travis yeah  taliesin vex you and i should hang back but well let everyone else  marisha its a big obelisk are there any birds or anything like that around  matt listening thats whats interesting usually forests because theyre teeming with so  much life theres a perpetual sound of things that live amongst the boughs and the treeline  because its so cold here its eerily silent every footfall that hits the snow you can hear  the crunch resounding and echoing through the nearby vicinity it is just a still /none/ silent  atmosphere in this forest  laura clanging pike  travis let me check if its safe to move on and i reach down and scoop up a handful of snow  right just snow hows it taste  matt its the clearest snow youve tasted in a long time  travis shits crazy pure yo  sam so then were safe to move ahead  travis yeah were good lets go check out the scary obelisk  liam everybody starts inhaling snow  matt are you moving ahead grog  travis im moving ahead who wants to come /none/ with me to the obelisk  laura im going to hide behind a tree and watch  liam to the what what obelisk  travis for what why are you hiding  laura im just going to keep guard  marisha ill come with you grog  travis theres nobody out here  taliesin ive had bad luck touching things lately im letting other people touch things  matt grog keyleth  sam pikes coming  matt so grog keyleth pike and scanlan are all going forward looks like vex vax and percy are  staying  taliesin im getting /none/ another angle so that we have two different vantage points of what may  happen  laura getting a little closer but keeping  matt are you going with percy  liam im brainfarting so im just following percy  matt okay percy and vax splinter off to the left vex you go ahead and take the right and you  head around this clearing while the rest of you walk into the center of it  taliesin were keeping an eye on that thing in the  liam look at that  taliesin i know its a thing were /none/ going to let grog touch it and see what happens  matt you guys approach and as youre stepping through the snowfall which right now is for you  up to just past your knees like the grass was for keyleth its just up to your waist scanlan  you and pike are both grunting like the dogs jumping through the snow that vanish with each  leap as youre having to find your way through this heavy snowfall  travis do you guys want a ride  sam yes please  travis i pick up each gnome on my /none/ shoulders  ashley thanks grog  travis no problem  matt go ahead and make an investigation check as you guys approach this obelisk  sam 25  travis its a two minus three  marisha 11  matt what did you get pike  ashley 14  matt 14 okay so as you guys approach from this vantage point its carved definitely and the  carving is very old weathered somewhat but not too heavily so its either not very old or  theres not a whole lot of weather that comes through here and by the stillness of /none/ the wind  since youve entered you get the feeling thats probably more the case its hard to gauge  how old or how long its been here but there are various carvings amongst it there is a big  symbol i want to have you guys roll a religion check real fast  travis awesome what the fuck natural one  laura you need to not use that dice right now  sam 12  marisha religion nine  matt pike  ashley 15  matt 15 okay it looks familiar but youre having a hard time really getting /none/ the essence  pike you recognize this this is not the largely understood or most commonly utilized symbol of  ioun but it is a very ancient the basis of the religion of ioun which is the same goddess of  knowledge that osysa was overseeing the temple beneath  ashley wait how do you spell it  matt ioun ioun you actually carry a stone enchanted with the essence of iouns knowledge  sam oh thats my ion stone ioun stone  travis is it made of its stone  matt its solid solid stone and goes up about /none/ 35 feet or so  travis hey scanlan i heard if you touch your tongue to something like this itll stick  sam wow wow we should probably try that out keyleth  marisha what  sam can you go lick that obelisk  marisha hell no  travis why not  marisha i know that one but you should do it grog i cant do it just because of my elven  abilities its our saliva it doesnt work the same way but you should try it its crazy  taliesin keyleth that was very clever  sam how /none/ far are we  matt you guys are about ten feet from it  sam im going to just look around it for any traps  matt okay make an investigation check  sam 18  matt 18 okay you have to leap off grog and start wading through youre finding pieces of  broken stone smaller chunks about that big and bits of stone dust that are scattered amongst the  snow you push around because you see the ruined walls around you do find a larger piece of stone  that looks like a broken statue like there /none/ must have been some sort of a statue here that had lost  the hand and its stumbled there on the ground  marisha upon him seeing that i pull out my hunk of quall and see if it lights up  sam oh you have to concentrate on it  taliesin are there orcs present  matt laughs  taliesin i knew someone would laugh at that  matt you hold it aloft it has a small vibration of energy as part of the crystal sliver itself  but it doesnt seem to change in the environment  marisha /none/ can i move a little bit closer to the obelisk  matt as youre stepping closer to the obelisk you also notice there is some writing or some sort  of scripture that is carved towards the base that is partially buried by the snow that has gathered  at its base you find more pieces of statues arms part of a torso like somebody had knocked  over a series of statues a lot of them have deep grooves in them like these statues were either  carved to pieces like they were physically torn down  taliesin are /none/ you describing what youre seeing at all  sam sure  taliesin i cant have a reaction to this unless im actually hearing anything  marisha i do control water can i do control water and clear away all the snow from around it  matt it takes you a little bit of concentration because its in a different state than liquid but  you begin to focus and as you guys are watching keyleth focusing a lot of the ice begins to  rapidly melt into a water form and it begins to melt away leaving the wet muddy /none/ ground around it  sam these statues that have been broken they have gashes and slashes in them  matt yes around the areas where theyre broken  sam okay  taliesin can i see the statues at this point  matt from this distance you cant unfortunately  taliesin i want to get a little closer just so i can make out the statues  matt okay as the snowfall begins to melt away you guys see around the base of this obelisk it is  a garden of statuepieces  sam hey hey guys  taliesin are they /none/ classical statues or are they people in weird poses are the poses weird  matt some poses look aggressive some poses look surprised  sam okay everybody hey hey hey  taliesin back up everybody back up now  matt and were going to go ahead and take a break on that note  laura we fought basilisks in the frostweald before  liam basilisks here yes  matt so were going to go ahead and take a quick break here for the restroom and  marisha son of a bitch  ashley son of a bitch  matt see /none/ you guys here in a few minutes  travis i dont see what the problem is  break  matt hello and welcome back everyone so as the snow is melted away revealing this garden of  statues in various states of some of them are still solid some of them are just missing pieces  some of them are entirely shattered many of them crushed or torn thick heavy grooves visible on the  pieces of them that have been torn asunder the party begins to gather their thoughts and figure  out what this might be you did /none/ notice as well that there was writing or script among the bottom  of the obelisk and as the snow melts away there is another large shape that is carved into it  travis can i hold my hand up to the obelisk and just feel if theres any like heat radiating off  of it  matt sure as you walk up to the edge of the obelisk and put your hand to it no heat being  radiated  marisha i pull out the hunk of quall again anything hold it closer to the symbol  matt it /none/ does not seem to be reacting to anything in the immediate vicinity  travis man somebody does not like sculptures  sam that  taliesin those arent sculptures  marisha can i do a nature check  travis no its art i get it  matt what languages do you know  travis its like interpretations and it seems whimsical  laura can i hop on the broom and fly up and see if i could spot some basilisks around  matt sure  ashley well percy what do you think they are  travis where is she going  /none/ marisha sorry elven sylvan druidic primordial  matt as you walk up and begin to hold the hunk of quall towards it you see that the language the  script that is beneath the initial symbol of ioun that scanlan had seen is elvish  marisha oh okay  matt the rough translation is of old old old text it reads a name is earned  marisha a name is earned  matt a name is earned  taliesin oh no  matt and beneath it there is what appears to be the other large carving you saw on it /dung/ it  looks like a triangle a dark recessed triangle that is just built beneath the text that tapers  internally into a point it is almost like a reverse pyramid on the inside it is just an empty  space that comes to a point  taliesin oh no i think that there are basilisks nearby  laura do i see any  taliesin i think these statues are victims  marisha can i do a nature check to see if i can see any signs of basilisks  matt sure make a nature check and  you make /none/ perception check  sam are we having a short is this a short rest  matt no  marisha 21  matt 21  laura 26  matt 26 you glance up above and you do not see any basilisks what you can see this clearing  itself is visible from your height but once you get above the treeline you can see the trees  are pretty thick you dont see any signs of basilisks in the vicinity you upon looking around  the ground you can see its very muddy now from all the snow that had melted /none/ down and you see  that some of the mud is slicking into holes in the ground like fourfootwide cavernous holes that  were dug like little burrows that now have all this water and mud seeping into them  marisha oh it was made by a creature it looks like  matt it looks like which one of them bubbling expels a bunch of the mud and water it just comes  bubbling outward at which point you see something burst out and emerge onto the ground  nearby more of these holes start bursting forth all the mud /none/ and liquid that has seeped into it is now  being forced outward and these creatures now covered in mud you can see long lizardlike  bodies with a toothy snout multiple legs rows of them of them down the spine and its tail  flickering about  liam im closing my eyes  laura dont look at them  matt i would like you all to roll initiative  marisha fuck shit im standing right in the middle of them  travis fuck you  marisha got the fucking shittiest initiative rolls  ashley yikes  taliesin i have /none/ a terrible initiative roll  sam okay this is it  travis feral instincts screwing me up  sam battle in the snow but weve got ashley  matt its hard to see with the mud across their surface but you do see hints of blue coming  through you have encountered these previously these are referred to as the icescaled basilisks  the ones that are more specific to this indigenous region all righty so going by initiative order  here folks 25 to 20  laura 22  matt 22  travis percy  matt 20 to 15 /none/  liam 18  sam 19  matt 15 to ten  taliesin 13  travis 11  matt all right  taliesin i rolled really badly  travis yeah  laura pike  ashley i know i know my initiative is always shit  travis welcome back pike  laura she likes to get the lay of the land before she attacks  ashley yeah yeah you know i do the cleanup  matt is that everybody  marisha pike  ashley im eight  matt pike oh all right due to the series of rolls here theyre going /none/ last  sam oh  matt they rolled a five minus one penalty to dex so as these which more of them burst up  right next to scanlan right there  sam oh great  matt as they all burst out of the ground shaking their heads off of the mud swinging off slapping  into the stone splattering across the white snow around them across some of you they snarl and  hiss as you see their eyes now click  liam merry christmas  matt so top of this would be you vex you actually would be /none/ on top here on the broom  looking from above  laura we cant look at them right we remember that from before  matt you remember youll want to try not to  laura can we we can look at them to shoot at them and look away just dont look at  them at all  matt you can choose at the start of your turn whether to avert your gaze or not youll have  disadvantage on pretty much everything as long as youre doing that  laura ah thats so annoying i cant tell how everybodys /none/ clumped theyre just  basically theyre all amongst all of our friends  matt theres three right here and one right there behind its one two three four  laura okay can i fly down and land on a tall tree  matt you can try to  laura try to brace myself  matt if you would like to try to  laura yeah  matt lets say for the purposes of this that you coast down to the height stupid broom lets say  you land down somewhere over here  laura okay  matt all righty there /none/ you are  laura okay i avert my gazeish i look off to the side of one but i can see it in my  peripheral is that how it goes or its like  matt you kind of guess where it is real fast in the peripheral and kind of  laura i hunters mark one  matt which one  travis laser pointer  laura is that scanlan that its next to  liam yeah its scanlan next to one of them  laura i do the one next to scanlan that was my eye thats just a /none/ flashlight oh thats how i do  it okay  matt and what are you doing  laura im going to  liam professional dd player  laura thats right and im going to shoot it  matt go for it  laura through the blazing bowstring  matt okay so go ahead and roll with disadvantage for the first strike  laura oh i dont get regular because its my favored terrain so i cancel it all out  matt its disadvantage for averting your gaze advantage for being your favored terrain i  dont think you get advantage /none/ on attacks for being in favored terrain do you i think its just on  ability checks  laura okay  matt yeah so youre at disadvantage  laura im at disadvantage  matt ill doublecheck this so the internet doesnt scream at me  laura 18  matt 18 with disadvantage  laura yeah  matt that still hits go ahead and roll damage  laura plus the blazing bowstring plus an additional d10  matt first attack on the basilisk near scanlan  laura 17  matt 17 damage all right go ahead and roll for the second /none/ attack with disadvantage as well  laura 17  matt 17 does hit as well so roll for that one you included the blazing bowstring for the first  one right  laura yes 15 on the second  matt 15 points of damage holding on the top of the tree which is starting to bow a little bit  with your weight and youre clutching the broom under one arm and you pull back and release two  arrows in succession both finding their mark you did hunters mark damage on top of those  laura yes i did /none/  matt all right good you see scanlan as you try and avert your gaze momentarily as you see the  giant creature there and you recall two arrows streak past which gives you a little ptsd based  on your morning so thatll complete your turn  laura yeah  matt all right scanlan youre up  sam its right next to me  matt yes are you averting your gaze or not  sam im averting my gaze  matt all righty  sam well jeez i mean do i know where they are  matt you saw /none/ them all burst out once they shook off the mud you heard her shouting and  you were like oh hmm  sam so i kind of know where they are all right im going to hop away five  feet from the guy whos im going to get an attack yeah thats a fine direction sure  matt it lunges out at you with a strike  sam yeah  matt that is a 22 to hit  sam yeah  matt all righty as you pull away pain strikes your body as the sharp stonecrumbling teeth of  /none/ the basilisk reach out and pierce your body for 12 points of piercing damage you wrestle your elbow  out of the way you can feel the wound beneath your leather armor  taliesin thats barely an arrow and a chicken in the neck  sam laughs okay and im going to aim to the one in the middle there does anyone have a  pointer yeah that one the other two are within 20 feet of him yes  matt yes  sam so i will cast a wand of fireballs right there on him  laura yeah  /none/ matt on him or behind him or where  sam just behind him so it hits all three  matt right and not yourself  sam yes  matt i figured thats probably what you want to do  okay as you back up release it in that direction the beam of  light streaks out from the wand hitting the snowbank right behind it and exploding already  the slushy atmosphere is snow and fire scatter around it as they both screech out in pain dc of what  sam oh dc 15 i wrote it down  matt /none/ 15 thats first one fails second one rolled a 15 with its minus one dex thats a 14  thats a fail and a natural one so full damage for all three of them go ahead and roll that 8d6  vax youre on deck so be ready  liam all right okay  sam 25  matt 25 points of damage total  the flames subside after the force of the explosion the obelisk itself shakes from the  impact the three basilisks look notably charred whatever mud was on them is immediately dried  and is now cracking /none/ on the outside of their scales you hear the hissing at their presence  you want to keep moving or stay where you are  sam ill tuck around the obelisk a little bit  matt okay  sam and ill turn to pike my love and inspire her with a song i will sing singing i used to  scry you on the shit phone  laughter  sam singing latenight when i need your love i know when that poop phone glows it can only be  one gnome ever since you left the party you you  /none/ laughter  travis yes  matt take your d10 inspiration die pike all right so d10 inspiration die for you vax  youre up  liam yes im going to click my heels together set the boots going im going to go very far away  towards you your end of the map i want to be about a little away from the tree though so ive  got a clear sight on that one further back though i know i want to be 50 feet away yeah  matt okay youre far away youre offmap  liam and im /none/ going to daggerdaggerdagger him from very far away  matt okay  ashley daggerdaggerdagger  liam and im going to use that sharpshooter trick where i take a negative five to attack but add  ten to damage  matt okay go for it  laura on all of them  matt are you averting your gaze  liam no  sam whoa  matt all right so at the start of your turn on your first part of the round i want you to go  ahead and make a constitution saving throw  liam from this far away /none/  matt when you started your turn you were in melee  liam okay so constitution  matt constitution saving throw  liam 16  matt 16 total  liam yes  matt okay the gaze is upon you as you glance over and see the basilisk turn its head over its  shoulder at you and hisses and the eyes catch you you can feel the magical effects take hold  of your body for a moment you back away and quickly close your eyes and you can feel that it  begin to reach over but you shake /none/ it off  liam oh yeah gamble worked out man  matt so you do not have disadvantage in these attacks  liam yeah i know  matt minus five for each attack  liam first one and advantage because im going before it so the first one is 18  matt 18 hits  liam second is 14 and the third is 27  matt first hits last hits  liam last hits  matt yes  liam okay first one gets sneak attack damage and plus ten to both hits because of the  sharpshooter  matt correct /none/  liam right so here we go  laura singing there can only be one gnome  liam i cant think 33 43 for the first one  sam 43  liam nonono 43 plus 49 for the first one  matt 49 points of damage  liam and the last one that hits is 19 sharpshooter  matt as you run backwards at the basilisk glaring back at you its toothy mouth opening and  the breath out you shake it off throw the daggers one impact sticks into one eye and the  other just impact into the /none/ other and it  cheering  marisha damn  laura that was fast  matt the snow nearby is spattered with this kind of darkpurple basilisk blood  sam ugh my eyes  laura gasp basilisk blood we need to take the basilisk blood remember thats super good  marisha yes yup uhhuh  matt you want to stay where you are  liam i will take another ten feet back away from it all bye guys  matt all right percy youre up  taliesin okay  matt avert your gaze or   taliesin no  matt roll /none/ a constitution save  marisha gamblers  liam singing you got to know when to hold em  taliesin thats a counts 21 points  matt 21  taliesin constitution save  sam oh its a save thats right  matt what did you roll  taliesin i rolled a 14 plus seven  matt thats great  taliesin i look at it in the eye  matt you stare it down and it kind of snarls  taliesin barks bark it down  matt orthax has left his mark on you  taliesin i know i cast hex on /none/ it im looking at the one shes hunters marked i cast hex  laura ooh nice  liam are you gonna bark all day little doggie  matt same one that shes hunters marked  taliesin yeah and im taking im giving it a disadvantage on willpower ability checks  matt okay  taliesin and im going to take three shots with sharpshooter  matt go for it  taliesin 12 misses  matt misses unfortunately  taliesin oh my god goodbye going to the good die 12 better 24  matt yeah third shot hits go ahead and roll /none/ damage with the hex damage as well  taliesin oh my god im sucking 22 points of damage  matt 22 points of damage so the first shot goes wide second shot goes wide again for some  reason its moving faster than you expected at this moment missing your sights the third shot  manages to find the front of its nose and shattering the front of its skull shatters and  it kind of crumbles to the ground  taliesin so while shooting i ran from that one tree all the way to the other one that was /none/ a  running shot so  matt okay so you run this way  taliesin yeah  liam it was a lot harder the last time  taliesin behind the tree over there  matt over here because you can only get  about that far with your running  taliesin about there  matt right there okay then you got behind there thats fine all right that ends your  turn percy grog youre up  travis i would like to avert my gaze and go into an avertedgaze rage growls  laughter  travis and i would like /none/ to run at that little bastard right there  matt all right  liam grog voice i cant see you but im so angry  travis im using my feral no thats wrong im using my what the fuck is it called  taliesin slap fight hair pull  travis ive totally forgotten whats it called what the fuck is it reckless attack  matt all right there you go  travis yes so can i cancel out the disadvantage and get just a normal roll  matt yes you would have a normal roll on this  travis yes /none/ and great weapon master on these two strikes  matt all right  travis shit nine  matt whoosh  travis yells laughs shit nope  laura its a bad luck night for grog rolling  matt you rush forward sword swinging you thought it was there youre sure it was there  you heard it hiss its about two inches below where you swung  travis im so mad that i come out of my rage because i dont hit anything right  matt you dont have to hit it you have to attack theres a difference  travis /none/ well ive been swinging  matt yeah laughs ending grogs turn keyleth youre up  marisha how many are left two  matt there are two left  marisha i am remembering what the basilisks did last time and ive only done this once before  and am going to go  matt avert your gaze or not  marisha im looking down and transforming into a giant scorpion  taliesin scorpions are fascinating  sam how so they dont have eyes or something  marisha yeah they have blindsight  sam wait what does that mean  marisha it /none/ means they dont use their eyes to see things they have blindsight  matt so scanlan as youre averting your gaze you glance over as keyleth goes poof into this  giant scorpion big tail big pincers black and red carapace its upsetting  sam im scared  marisha clicking pincers  taliesin thats really upsetting  marisha where are they the two are kind of in the middle there  sam ones next to grog  marisha okay im going to move in between them and im going to do a multiattack on both of  those ill start /none/ on the one that grogs not focusing on  matt okay go for it  marisha so i have three attacks two with my claws and one with my stinger  matt do it disadvantage on all attacks  marisha no why  matt because you averted your gaze  marisha no i didnt i have blindsight as a scorpion  matt right but at the start of your turn before anything happens is when it happens did you  avert your gaze or not  marisha no i turned into a scorpion  matt before that happened at the /none/ start of your turn did you avert your gaze or not  liam you said you averted your gaze  marisha i said i looked down but once im a scorpion i have blindsight  matt right but the effect takes place before your transformation happens so yes or no do you  want to take the advantage or not  marisha well i said i looked down and turned into a scorpion to try and avoid it so i mean  i did yeah  matt all right so disadvantage on the attacks  marisha thats the whole reason /none/ i did the scorpion  sam but its also looking cool  laura its okay from here on out youre fine  marisha miss six misses for the first one thats a three it misses again nope thats a  two last one is an eight plus a four so thats 12 probably still nothing  matt let me think here for a second the scorpion has blindsight  sam starring ashley johnson blindsight  taliesin how did we not walk into that how have we been sitting here and that didnt happen  marisha that legitimately made me spit /none/ my fucking coffee in my face  matt no youre right i was thinking more in terms of it averting the magical power of the  basilisk but you could still avert and blindsight would allow you to still know where it is without  having the disadvantage so yes  liam although with coffee in the eye disadvantage is back  matt this is true ill let you reroll those attacks  marisha all three okay i wish i remembered them do you want me to reroll all three  matt just reroll all three thats on me i /none/ was thinking in wrong terms  sam matt youre the worst  matt i know i know i am the worst  marisha jeez im going to tweet at you later about this  taliesin actually matt how blindsight works  matt theyve already been sent im sure  taliesin im shutting the fuck up now  marisha these are just straight they dont have disadvantage first attack 14  matt 14 does not hit unfortunately  marisha second attack was a natural 18 so 22  matt that does hit and for the tail  marisha for the tail /none/ 16  matt 16 hits that was my bad  liam just a bunch of idiots dorking around guys  taliesin there is coffee everywhere  marisha thats not very much four damage for the claw attack and then for the sting oh my god  three damage and they have to take a constitution saving throw  matt 15 whats the dc  marisha 12  matt yeah so it makes the save  marisha fuck  sam yeah keyleth good one  marisha okay they take 4d10 poison and on a failed save they take half as much /none/  matt okay so roll 4d10  sam 4d10 is a lot  laura you should be a scorpion all the time  marisha thanks guys wow these are fucking horrifying rolls six seven eight nine plus  seven is 16 points of poison damage  matt total so that would be eight for half of it  marisha no that is halved  matt nice thats not bad at all all right so as your first claw streaks off its armor the  second one grabs hold and hold on a second  liam im listening  matt thank /none/ you  marisha sorry it was eight damage  taliesin no you did because you did half the dice  sam no she did 4d10  taliesin she did 4d10  marisha eight damage  matt eight damage all right all right so as the first claw streaks across its armor second one  manages to grab and actually pince onto it dealing some damage as youre holding it there  the tail strikes inward manages to pierce the outside of the scaly basilisk hide not as  effective as it couldve been but still you see its body tense /none/ with the sudden pulse of poison in  its system that brings us to pike whats up  ashley okay since i cant see it is there any way that i can guiding bolt one of the basilisks  without hurting anybody  matt yeah but for guiding bolt i believe its a spell attack roll am i correct on that or does  it automatically hit im trying to remember which one it is you guys have so many spells guiding  bolt yeah you can totally guiding bolt youll have disadvantage on the attack roll but you can /none/  do it still  laura do it pike  ashley all right lets do it  matt all right so go ahead and roll with disadvantage on the attack  sam which one the one near grog or the one near scorpionface  ashley which one would i not hurt anybody  matt its not so much you hurting anybody you wouldnt hit anybody its about if you miss or not  marisha grog and i can take it anyway  ashley okay  liam the one by grog  ashley yeah well do the one by grog  /none/ matt okay  ashley oh natural 20  matt but its with disadvantage so you have to roll it again  liam say it again  taliesin one in 20 chance  ashley 13  matt with that unfortunately as youre holding your eyes at bay  sam wait youre inspired  matt you can add the inspiration dice if you want to  ashley yeah ill add inspiration  matt okay so roll a d10 and add that to the attack 13 plus  ashley okay okay okay all right seven so 20  matt go ahead and roll /none/ damage on guiding bolt so 4d6 radiant damage  ashley okay 17  matt nice all right 17 points of radiant damage and now there is a glowing hue of radiant  light around it so even though youre not looking at it its a pretty decent beacon so it gives  advantage on the next attack roll against it keep that in mind do you want to move at all or do you  want to stay where you are pike  ashley ill stay yeah ill stay  matt all right now it is their turn this one /none/ turns around and its going to go ahead and make a  bite attack against you keyleth in scorpion form thats a 17 plus six  marisha that hits  matt all right you take 11 plus three 14 points of piercing damage plus seven points of  poison damage  marisha so that was 21  taliesin my brain is not doing numbers for some reason  marisha i know and i keep looking at you  matt against you grog it hits you regardless it has advantage on you because youre averting  your gaze plus you had /none/ your reckless attack last round it still only rolls a nine plus six so  thats 14 15 to hit  travis misses  matt this one bites out towards you and even though its not there because its so bright you  see it shift and you boom hit it in the front of its snout with the base of your sword that  brings us to the top of the initiative order vex youre up  laura awesome so its the glowing one i get advantage on the attack because its glowing  matt you do yes  /none/ laura im going to hunters mark it  matt okay so hunters mark moves over  laura im going to avert my gaze and roll a regular attack then since its advantage  matt yes it cancels out the disadvantage so roll your first attack against it  laura thats 31  matt 31 hits yeah  laura 15 plus hunters mark oh i didnt hunters mark it  matt and taliesin yeah you did  laura okay what did i say 15 18  matt 18 all right so the first arrow strikes into it its still standing its /none/ looking a  little hurt but its still standing  laura and then do i still get regular attacks this is at disadvantage  matt disadvantage on the next one yeah  laura 19  matt yeah whats your total 19 with disadvantage that does hit yep  laura 18  matt 18 all right this arrow however manages to strike through the top of the head stapling  the mouth shut and it falls to the ground as its eyes slowly glaze over  laura i roar from up in the tree  taliesin wait do you let go /none/ of the broom to roar  laura no i hold the broom in my hand  marisha katy perry style  laura defying gravity style  liam holding it in your hand while youre flying on it  laura im not flying im in a tree dude  matt yeah shes clutched up on top of a tree  liam im not looking at you  matt all right that brings us to scanlan are you averting your gaze or not  sam im not only averting my gaze im looking towards the holes that it came out of any /none/ of the  holes that are near me  matt theres two that are near you  sam okay im going to go over to one and throw a fireball down into it  matt okay so scanlan you walk over to the nearby holes behind you where the one that snuck  up behind you essentially came out of aim down and make sure you mark off these charges for each  use of the wand  sam yes  matt you whoosh release the beam which gets about 15 20 feet down before it blasts i need  /none/ you to make a dexterity saving throw  travis like putting yourself at the mouth of a cannon  sam seven  laura oh no  matt roll 8d6 but take half damage because its mostly guarded and this is a circumstantial at  the outskirts of it youre not taking the full brunt of the fireball however you do get caught  in the very edge of the backblast  sam 29  matt so you take half that so you take 15 points of fire damage and are blown about five feet  backward onto the ground however /dung/ the ground shudders beneath all your feet and the earth the  wet damp earth squelch sinks inward and the tunnel collapses a few of the others squelch  into it theres still a couple more on the opposite side that are open theres two more on  this side that are open  sam so the tunnels nearest me are not accessible anymore  matt the two that were there and there both the ground from it shuddering collapsed inward and  now the mud has filled the space theres these small sinkholes where they were  sam all /dung/ right ill spend the rest of my time in this round licking my wounds and studying the  obelisk to see if i can see any other clues or anything on it  matt okay you can see the text that she saw upon there the elvish script  sam i cant read it though  matt but you see it there and you see the triangle a dark recessed triangle about that big  that is in the base of it  sam is it a hole or is it  matt its a hole but its carved its /none/ not a perfect triangle it starts as a triangle and  slowly as it recesses inward comes to a point towards the back  taliesin like a reverse pyramid  sam i throw a snowball in it  matt impact  sam its safe guys  matt vax youre up  liam all right im off the map but i want to try to come down towards the tree that i think  percys at hes between two trees im going to avert my gaze im going to look at the ground  come up around the side of that /none/ tree and im listening for scorpion clacking and basilisk  hissing and im going to throw dagger dagger dagger in the direction of the basilisk i hear  near scorpion claws clutching does that make sense  matt mmhmm  liam all right so this is at disadvantage because im looking at the ground so first one  is first one is a 21  matt 21 hits  liam and second one is 19  matt hits  liam third one is 16  matt hits these are not with sharpshooter  liam no not at all so weve /none/ got ten plus nine plus ten  matt with that your final dagger hits in the side of its rib cage and the creature slumps over  on the ground letting out a horrible gurgling hiss as it slowly dies amongst the mud  liam daredevil  laura was that all of them  matt currently yes make a perception check  laura okay oh i roll with advantage because im in the forest oh my god i rolled a one twice  in a fucking row i see nothing  sam two natural ones  marisha we are fucking /none/ eating it on rolls tonight  matt youre about to look down to inspect the vicinity however the tree is starting to bow  forward and you grunt have to catch yourself and you have no chance to even survey the  territory  taliesin pine sap gets in your eye  liam laura bailey dies on stream  travis i rolled a 16  matt as you take a moment the rage still in you can hear the blood pumping in your ears but you  also hear the hiss rising hissing what sounds like a distant echo coming /none/ up from a subterranean  tunnel  laura oh no  marisha subterranean tunnel  travis yeah that fireball i think it might have pissed them off  sam good  marisha can i use my blindsight tremorsense to see if i can feel how far away they are  matt you do you feel beneath the ground its less of a tremorsense more being able to sense  the vibrations in the air around you you can tell that there is motion coming from underneath  marisha sounds like a lot of them  matt a few more  /none/ ashley fireball the other holes  marisha im going to drop my scorpion form  sam oh god keyleth youre horrible oh wait no youve turned back to normal  marisha the things you say scanlan im just going to do a wall of stone flat over the area  with the holes  matt so from the stone chunks and portions of the shattered bodies that litter part of this garden  a giant stone wall forms around them and builds over it sealing these holes eventually you hear  a knocking reptilian snarl scraping sounds  sam theyre /none/ friendly  liam i cant breathe down here  matt theyre not budging it theyre just hitting it from underneath and its getting more frantic  as time goes on  sam how long can you hold that  marisha itll last until they bust out of it so we either keep moving or figure out where were  going from here  sam what is this obelisk it seems important if these things are protecting it  laura what does it say  marisha it has writing in elvish in it  sam what does it say  marisha /none/ it says a name is earned in elvish  sam should we say a name to it and see what happens  matt one of the stone parts of the wall begins to crack from underneath  laura didnt osysa say something about her mate wouldnt say its name  sam thats right thats right  laura and this is a symbol of ioun  travis should we say ioun in elvish  marisha i say ioun in elvish  matt you say it out into the air  sam why dont you say it into this triangle hole over /none/ here  marisha ioun  laura say knowledge in elvish  marisha knowledge  sam elvish is just english except muffled  marisha im going in the triangle hole  matt a moment passes  marisha osysa sphinx  laura a name is earned  travis whats in the hole  marisha whats in the hole  sam i dont know whats in the hole nothing  matt a basilisk face bursts through the stone wall  sam whackamole grog whackamole  travis can i run over and play golf  matt yeah do you want to avert your gaze /none/ or not  travis nah  matt all right i need you to make a constitution saving throw  liam shite  travis 22  matt without an issue the eyes find yours and you just grin as you bring what kind of attacks  do you want to do  travis reckless and great weapon master  matt all right go for it  travis thats a natural 20 ill take that one on the first one  matt okay and the other one  travis 19 20  matt both hit the first is a critical this would /none/ be over here  travis 31  matt did you roll the is that times two  travis no thats just the attack  liam its critical  matt before you add your modifier  travis before the modifier it was 12 before the modifier  matt so 24 plus the modifier  travis which is 32 plus ten is 42  matt 42 did you roll the additional brutal critical rolls  travis nope  matt so roll 4d6 on top of that because of your brutal critical i think it is  liam i think we can all /none/ agree its the jelly of the month club at this point  travis 17  matt for a grand total of  sam 59  laura do you double those ones though because its the dice  travis thats just the first hit  matt yeah all right 59 points of damage you square up  travis happy gilmorestyle  matt you strike down with the blade at an angle using the stone holding it in place like an  executioners block and the blade scrapes against the stone as you strike finding itself embedding  about seven to eight /none/ inches into the throat of the basilisk as its heads protruding out  immediately blood begins to pour out of its side and its gurgling at its attempt to try and push  through you wedge the blade out go for your next strike you already rolled your attack which was  a 19 so roll damage on that one  travis seven 12 20 30 on the second one  liam oh thats all  matt with the second strike you whoosh clean slice the head splat onto the stonework there  the body still wedging the hole shut /none/ the neck is a clean cut and starts gouting blood out  travis i dip the tip of the sword into the little well and i pick up the head  matt which by the way both saving throws were failed so you gain another plus two to strength  sam wow youre catching up to pike  laura ow nothing  taliesin did you cut yourself on your cup  laura no i just hit my tooth  marisha and taliesin oh i hate that  matt all right so you can feel the impact still attempting from beneath /none/ growing more and more  frantic  marisha i say earned  ashley can i go collect some of the stuttering basilisk i cant say that can i get some of the  blood and collect it  matt sure and you notice that the longer it stays out there the blood itself is beginning to  freeze in the general atmosphere and get slushy  laura we can get some and put it in my bag it keeps things good  ashley can i stab the carcass then in another area and get some fresh in the body  /none/ matt yeah theres plenty of carcasses of basilisks around as theyre inspecting and you  still feel the impacts from underneath the stone wall from the other tunnel you manage to gather  well say two small vials of basilisk blood  ashley vex  travis yeah put it in vexs little refrigerator bag of holding  matt okay the slamming on the other side of the stone wall slowly subsides until silence comes  marisha did they give up  travis has anybody put their hand in the hole yet  laura its all you grog  travis all /none/ right i put my hand in the hole  matt where the one you killed is  travis no the triangle  matt okay so you take your hand and you place it inside this empty recess in the obelisk it  reaches in and the shadow of the obelisk completely takes it to the wrist  nothing happens  sam im going to take my ioun stone and shove it in the hole  matt okay you take the ioun stone and place it in the hole and it has a soft light that it gives  off naturally /dung/ from the magical enchantment and it lights the inside of the dark recess and as you  place it inside the top of the obelisk begins to glow eversofaintly like a little beacon the  very top of the stone glows a matching color to your stone  marisha a matching color  matt yeah i need you all to make a perception check  sam 17  marisha 14  liam 16  travis 19  laura 25  taliesin 11  sam ashley blindsight  ashley 16  matt okay you catch a little bit of this grog /none/ and you perk up as you notice and you see  immediately there is a matching beacon a faint glow that appears to be streaking down the  mountainside in the distance its a little bit offcenter from the direct south direction that  youre facing but there is a slight marker very faintly visible on the mountain range just  visible over the treetops  laura i drop a pin in that and i tell keyleth now you can use that thing  marisha i hold up the hunk of quall  laura no i mean your spell keyleth /none/ fastest way to get to this point  marisha i didnt bring it because everyone said not to learn that spell  sam that was today wasnt it  laura i thought you already learned it  marisha he said to learn something else because it wasnt going to be useful  laura no he said just dont use that thing  marisha no you said to learn something it was at the beginning of the day  sam you cant unlearn things its all good  laura its okay its okay i can see it  matt you had /none/ it already memorized when you guys got to the edge of the forest im pretty sure  marisha okay i thought you were saying to pick something else because it wouldnt be handy but i  take it back and ill use it now if you want  taliesin no were good were good  marisha im so confused  matt up to you  marisha is it me tonight  taliesin it is a really weird pot of coffee its not just you  marisha do i need sleep what am i missing  matt its all good  /none/ marisha i can keep it  travis just lick your finger and stick it in the wind  laura just use the spell and pretend that you never unlearned it  marisha i never unlearned it its been there the whole time i didnt use it its not like i used  a 6thlevel spell look guys find the path that way  matt okay so what is it that youre focusing on for the spell  marisha that beam of light  laura that i pointed out to her  marisha that she pointed out am i doing this /none/ wrong  matt no youre not doing it wrong you cast the spell and concentrating on the source of this  beacon you feel the direction that would pull you the best way to travel towards that beacon is to  travel towards that beacon  liam look youre just doing what the bossy halfelf told you to do just go with it  marisha what that one  liam thats the only bossy halfelf here  sam dm can i experiment and take away if i take away my ioun stone does the light fade  matt as you /none/ pull the ioun stone out of it the beacon does fade yes but you have a direction  marisha i have it marked now i have a pin in it right that counts  matt right no matter where you travel in this place you will have a directional position  towards that beacon  laura see there we go  marisha fucking handy that one is  travis yep redemption  marisha totally a great 6thlevel spell im going to use all the time going forward  liam oh for fucks sake here we go people here we go /none/ and were moving  travis we take off at a jog now  sam wait before we leave is there anything else we need to do here do we need to go down into the  tunnels do we need to piss on the obelisk do we want to do anything  liam you should piss on the obelisk just to be sure  taliesin you should lick it too after you piss on it  travis lets not  sam lets go  matt are you guys leaving  sam wait we need some basilisk blood and stuff  /none/ laura we got some  matt youre standing amongst the obelisk a long series of mud with a bunch of mostly together  stone statues of people and pieces of people around  travis do we want to check the other building ruins we didnt check those at all theres a  whole corner of a building over there  laura sure  travis well go check it  laura i go look at it  liam halfelves look at the building structure  matt make an investigation check  travis what the hot holy fuck  liam 26  /none/ taliesin it says it was forged by dwarves thats all i can understand  laura investigation  matt investigation yeah  laura 19  matt 19 all right you guys both start gathering around the sides of the ruin glancing about the  outside it looks like at one point it was a smaller structure probably part of the  construction like this here was a satellite place of worship for ioun like a beacon as part of a  journey but nothing about it catches your eyes as youre stepping over the remnants of the stone  individuals on /none/ the ground you catch your eye on one of the individuals you see lying partially  submerged in the snow and mud you glance down and see two arms that are out like this although the  right arm from the elbow down is missing its broken off in stone both are reaching out a  young human male shortish brown hair spectacles at the end of his nose thin body and tuckedin  nice buttoned shirt slacks this is tyriok the mapmaker  liam the mapmaker  taliesin youre a terrible person  laura no why would you do /none/ that matthew  matt i didnt do this he was travelling the world to take notes people  liam i take wait everybody shush i look at him for a moment and then i leave him and i dont  tell anyone else  marisha what  sam we have pike with us  liam i dont tell anyone else pike didnt see him his arm is broken off you dont fucking know  he exists hes gone  ashley but but  laura thats terrible  taliesin why dont you two just write a sequel to batmansuperman while youre /none/ at it just destroy  everything i dont care anymore  laura we could heal him  matt you dont know eventually after you guys do a perusal of the ruins you find your way back  to the party and you guys continue travelling which way towards the beacon  laura towards the beacon  marisha ive got it in my head now  liam wait wait wait i go to pike i go to pike pike  ashley yeah hi vax  liam do you remember that mapmaker were you with us so much shit has happened do /none/ you remember  tyriok the mapmaker  ashley i dont think i was with you  liam theres a man over there his arm is gone can you fix stoning can you fix a man whos been  turned to stone  ashley i can try remember one time we fixed vex when she was turned to stone the last time we  fought the basilisks  liam two years ago yeah what did we do  ashley we covered her in basilisk blood  liam i need to take a walk could you do that could you do that /none/  ashley sure which stone is he  liam look over there by that tree there do you see him theres two hands pointing towards the sky  sam one hand  liam two  ashley one and a half all right can i head over there  matt you walk over there and you do see a number of broken body parts all turned to stone in  various states of disuse and crumbling you do see a young man whos caught with his arms out one  broken off at the elbow staring up glasses at the end /none/ of his nose looking both frightened and  frozen in a moment of complete unaware danger  ashley okay can i try covering him in some of the basilisks blood  matt sure you take one of the vials that you collected and take the basilisk blood and pour it  over the statue the blood congeals and spills over crystallizing slowly as the ice cold gets to  it it doesnt seem to have an effect  ashley its been too long  matt you gather based on the last time it happened the blood needs to be applied /none/ within a  short period of time after the person turns to stone do you have anything else that might help  ashley probably greater restoration  matt do you have that prepared  ashley i do  matt you concentrate grasping the symbol of sarenrae around your neck and touch your hand out  the warm glow of sarenraes divine energy transferring into the stone form the form glows  with energy and the glow subsides and fades the stone texture of his body beginning to slowly  soften and the color returning to his skin and for a /none/ moment the head seems to shake and the eyes  clarify and a voice begins to peek through these previously frozen vocal cords i mean no  screams as all of a sudden his arm begins to spray gouts of blood  travis i got it i got it i start catching it with the sword  matt stuttering he turns to you and sprays right across your face  travis good splash on yes  matt help help me  ashley i grab his arm and cure wounds i dont know if thats a really good move  matt /none/ go ahead and heal him up a bit  ashley can i try to reattach his arm  matt you gather that might have been something to do before you had restored him  sam oh shit  matt however go ahead and heal for cure wounds roll a d8 plus five  travis thats kind of fucking hilarious  ashley 5d8 plus five  matt depending on what level you want to use on him a level one is 1d8 plus five  ashley oh god okay i feel like im using all this but i dont know okay /none/ so lets do level five  matt level five all right go for it 5d8 plus five  taliesin not our finest hour pretty reasonable hour but its definitely not the finest we  brought most of a mapmaker back  matt so how much is that  ashley 29  matt 29 okay as you reach out and grasp the edge of his bleeding stump  ashley stop moving  matt i just yelps the warmth causes the pain to fade and he calms for a second oh  sorry he looks down as the wound has stopped bleeding /none/ skin is scabbed over and it looks like  its now in a place where its no longer an open wound it is mostly healed over though he is now  missing part of his arm  laura can you regrow his little arm like you regrew my brothers little nubbin of a toe  matt this is a bit beyond your healing capabilities  travis cmon deadpool hand  matt at which point he goes thank you small one i and he goes to reach up for his glasses  and other hand  laura oh were terrible  /none/ taliesin technically saved seveneighths of a mapmaker  matt he looks around at the rest of you oh hello its been a while we havent well i  seem to have gotten myself in a bit of a predicament  sam what happened  matt well i was well i had two escorts and i had been making my way through most of  taldorei and had gotten as far as this region and thats all i remember  laura basilisks big lizard creatures  matt yes very scary i tried to run and thats all i remember  laura /none/ was it just the three of you then not a large group of people  matt no just three of us  ashley what were you doing over here  matt i was trying to finish this portion of the map if i ah and he goes over and reaches  through some of the snow and pulls up a large stone bag that is currently still attached to his  broken arm  taliesin no  matt um is this  travis nope no no thats just part of a it was a statue garden its not a big /none/ deal its  just a fragment  matt all right well these were my maps  sam are they stone  matt they are stone currently  laura can we oh no  travis is he on the ground still  matt no hes standing oh boy he takes his glasses off and goes to rub them into his shirt  and does it with one hand and puts them back on  ashley oh buddy  laura i feel terrible  matt well  taliesin its like a onelegged duck walking around  matt what do i do  /none/ travis which hand does he have his left  matt he has his left hand  travis are you righthanded  matt im kind of ambidextrous  travis thank gods for that  laura thats good thats good well  taliesin a lots happened  matt theres shock on his face he still hasnt quite taken in all of this stuff  sam everything is going to be okay  marisha well you have a great story now  taliesin and a period of adjustment  matt this is very true this is a valid point  taliesin we should /none/ send him back to the encampment  laura its like a twoday walk  sam these escorts you had with you who were also turned to stone were they important to you were  they friends of yours  matt i hired them as part of this endeavor they were nice fellows hold on a second he starts  walking off and starts rummaging through the pieces of stone and various people picking up  heads no well thats alex golly i dont i dont know where gerald is but can i come with  you for now  laura /none/ well youre more than actually  travis no  laura hes rather smart isnt he  sam he has knowledge of the area  taliesin that actually could be useful  laura heres the thing its very dangerous dear and its quite possible you might be turned  into stone again  matt i dont want that  laura no we dont want that for you either  travis also eaten alive burned shot stabbed  laura straightup killed  travis  pulled apart maimed  laura beheaded  travis  lacerated  laura all options  travis but thats /none/ just in the mornings  laura but youre more than welcome to join us for a short amount of time or you can head back  to a camp thats about a day and a half away  matt all right whereabouts are you going  travis were heading up the mountain  matt ill head for the camp  travis are you sure we could always use you as a decoy i mean as an aid  matt im good im all right thank you though i appreciate the offer i have a lot to think about  marisha /none/ i could  taliesin well well run into him when we get back  travis do you need a hand finding your way to the encampment  sam oh grog  taliesin not cool  liam groan  matt he starts walking northward basically trailing past the path where you guys walked from  laura i feel like we should help him or something  liam not bad enough to actually do it though right  marisha i have conjure woodland beings in my back pocket today so i could conjure you a little  posse to escort you  /none/ laura that would be good  liam have some squirrels buddy  marisha have a little posse  matt whats the duration on that one  marisha i dont know thats something else that i havent done ever  sam untested highlevel spell do it  marisha that always works so well  matt its an hour of concentration  travis is this as far as you got or did you make it up the mountain previously  matt i was cresting through the base of the mountain and made it most of the way down the  stormcrest and /none/ was heading back through the frostweald  travis oh youve been up there already  laura youve been to the base of the stormcrest mountains  matt i was kind of along the side we were trying to make our way through the central portion  of the mountain pass so we could keep track of the division of topography on both top and bottom  travis oh man why you didnt say so we could really use your help here  laura actually did you see something similar to this obelisk at the base of the mountain  matt /none/ uh he looks back and thinks to himself not quite like this though but there are a  number of cavern entrances that litter various portions of the base of the mountain  travis did you go in any of them  matt no see i was afraid those would be too dangerous so i went into the forest  travis right  matt anyway  travis well look you dont really seem to have a lot on you why dont you join us for just a  little bit to the areas that he knows and then well send /none/ you back on your way maybe with a bit  of ale a little bit of food maybe a weapon  matt that would be fantastic and thank you i realize now that if you hadnt come by i  probably would have been there forever  laura yes well were sorry about the arm dear  matt there are worse things and i can retrain to write with this arm its totally fine  sam yes youre lucky to be alive and now youre going on an adventure with us hey who has two  thumbs and is really /none/ excited you and me both doing this  matt you know what make a charisma check  taliesin you worry me  sam charisma  matt yeah add your plus five charisma bonus  sam 20  matt 20 as you do that he yeah youre right youre right im thankful to be alive  today and its because of you guys  liam technically true  matt lets travel  travis well listen ill walk with you lead the way  matt all right so where are you going because this place was dangerous and that place is  /none/ dangerous and we dont want to go that way  travis yeah vexahlia will point where were headed  laura why dont you want to go that way have you seen orcs in this wood  matt he points and says theres a lot of them that way we came through here to avoid them and  thats when this all happened  laura ooh actually we should probably take care of the orcs  taliesin get the orcs really quick and then we can send him back with the refugees from there  marisha we did say we were /none/ going to take care of the orcs  laura yes we did  marisha we did promise that  laura what do you say grog would you like to kill some orc  travis do you always ask questions to which you know the answer already  laura would you like to stay here while we fight the orcs or could you walk us towards them and  stay hidden  matt i dont want to stay here  laura then you come with us and then you stay very very hidden  matt i can do that i can /none/ definitely do that  taliesin when its time he can hide with the bear then a bear will be hiding with a mapmaker  or most of a mapmaker  sam well be fine lets go  matt all right  liam while all of that happened for the last ten minutes can i stealth away for a little bit  matt sure roll a stealth check  liam 31  matt okay based on passive perception nobody notices your exit  liam i dont want to go that far i want to go so i can still hear all /dung/ this bullshit behind me and  find a quiet spot  i know you can hear me im going to need im going to need more than nightmares a deal has  been struck and i will honor it i need to understand what this is any time  matt in that moment the white snow suddenly flashes to dark and its like you were struck  blind you gasp instinctually as your vision goes dark nothing and you see come from the shadow  another flash another vision its of vasselheim another flash you look out and you can /dung/ see  theres one large darkened structure that you have not visited but passed by on the southeastern  side of vasselheim  taliesin yeah temple temple of the raven queen  matt the actual name of this and youve heard it in passing before when you were given your  initial pass over of the im trying to find the specific name here so i dont mess it up its in  here somewhere you see this dark obsidian structure that is ridged almost like an even rib  cage along each side it is ominous and it stuck /dung/ out in the middle of the city because amongst the  rest of the jovial atmosphere it loomed over the amaranthine oubliette but this was the central  temple to the raven queen you then flash once again in a long chamber and you see veils dark  veils passing by one after another after another another flash forward and you see a  chamber with dark brown smooth floors you see gold trim along large pillars that reach up to a  dometype stained glass ceiling of amber colors and white and in the center of this chamber you /none/  see what appears to be a pool of still crimson liquid you see the crimson liquid shift and a  form rises up out of it an arm rises up and beckons a finger your vision goes to black and  youre back in the forest  liam fuck not exactly what i was talking about at some point a little bit of clarification  congratulations youre creepy as fuck well work it out i head back to the group  sam good talk  matt as you guys gather yourselves your new companion and start heading in the /none/ direction that  he ushered you within the frostweald towards where supposedly these orcs have holed up and made  their camp you know that the good news is you probably have the element of surprise in this but  youre not entirely sure what it is youre in for when you get there  thats where ill end todays session  groaning  laura that was a lot of sidetracks on this particular adventure  matt thats all right sidetracks
