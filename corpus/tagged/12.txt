none	 end of the chroma conclave and the completion of keyleths aramente they knew that  there was out there somewhere in the hells an infernal being a rakshasa known as hotis that  they had encountered previously in the past and was going to eventually claim vengeance on them  if they did not get to it fast as such through their research they found that it most likely  seemed to reside on the second layer of the hells dis ruling under dispater one of the archdevils  and after gathering your materials doing a bit of prep you 
town	 transitioned into the actual plane of  the nine hells of baator into the city of dis upon wandering the streets and trying to blend in  through various alterations to your physical forms you eventually found your way to after  avoiding a couple of possible confrontations in the street to a tavernlike location where you  decided not to order the meats that were being devoured by a couple of devilish entities and  instead the other thing  laughter  matt which involved both taryon and keyleth having their first taste of soul and eventually  percival 
none	 on the way out too you encountered the owner of the establishment a darkhaired  redskinned horned gentleman wings folded against his back who was eager to rent you a  place to stay for the time being and you guys decided to figure out what your plans were at  which point freddie and greg percival and grog went downstairs to have a conversation with  this entity where he revealed himself to be named ipkesh and was interested in possibly working out  sort of a crisscross quid pro quotype negotiation with your team after returning to  
none	 discuss the possibilities of this up in your chambers keyleth made her way out to locate the  possible location of hotis as a workaround as she exited the front exterior of the establishment and  went into an alleyway to attempt to transform she found herself followed by a chain devil and some  sort of a somewhat scarred and mutatedlooking dwarf they confronted you and were asking about  their interest in the white one seeming speaking about one of your companions vax who  had taken on the form of an albino tiefling when you entered the 
town	 plane we left off at a tense  moment and thats where we pick up this week as you stand in the darkened shadowed uncomfortably  hot air in the center of this alleyway behind these buildings crushed in these very thin spaces  with what looks to be a thinning exit behind you and these two devilish entitiesor devilish  entity and some sort of a messedup dwarf beginning to flank you with what looks to be  grotesque murder or thrill of coming pain in their eyes and faces what do you want to do  laughter  
none	 matt as you are alone  sam shell talk her way out of it like she always does  laughter  marisha ill have a panic attack is what clears throat i want to do all right fuck me okay  sam thats a good way to start  marisha ugh dont fuck this up dont fuck this up i am going to continue with my original plan  cant getting cotton mouth and laughs and im going to slowly start from the top down  transforming forming  sam wow wow  marisha shut up sam  matt via 
none	 what are what are you using what are you using  sam laughs this is rough already  matt are you using alter self  marisha no i want to use shapechange  matt so youre casting shapechange  marisha yes right because i cant alter self into an erinyes  matt no you cannot but however you did not quite cast shapechange last time  marisha right  matt  we had spoken so youre doing it now  marisha so im doing it now  matt okay so as they both begin to slowly flank from the sides 
none	 of the alleyway and youre holding  your ground insisting that this white one theyre asking about belongs to you they didnt  seem to buy your attempt at claiming territory so you begin to mutter the incantation beneath your  breath your hands move and you watch as you do so the chains of the chain devil begin to  continue to grind and shift around it like a hundred serpents of grinding metal and the dwarf  figure she begins sauntering up on the other side with this heavy limp as you watch the flesh  tearing with 
none	 small tendrils revealing beneath like a series of worms are almost emerging from  various folds and gashes in the flesh of the arm  sam ugh  matt you complete your shapechange spell as theyre pulling in on you what do you turn into  marisha an erinyes  matt oh sh okay  sam what was that what was that whats that do whats an erinyes  marisha its that thing that we fought in the city of brass  sam ooh cool  matt yeah they have challenge level 12 so you can do that okay so 
dung	  marisha there was like the devil that we fought  liam lady demon with pit fiend  matt yeah the one that the pit fiend summoned next to it so you have actually encountered it  travis that winged biatch  marisha yeah the one that you squared up against with for most of the time  travis yeah she didnt want none  marisha yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  matt as you finish the incantation your skin goes to a pale white your eyes becoming dark  deep red with these little burning golden coals for pupils 
none	 the rest of your skin grows fair but  thick with a very very fine series of scales across it as these giant black red wings emerge  from your back and unfold as they extend past you in both directions enveloping both sides of this  alleyway both the chain devil and the dwarfish entity stop in their tracks and take a couple of  steps back looking at you intensely  marisha deeper voice you know i never did catch your name  what do they call the two of you  matt make an intimidation check with 
none	 advantage  travis ooh thats good thats a good plan  sam advantage do it do it do it  matt because you are you look like a higher ranking devil  travis you got this in the city of dis  marisha you got dis  taliesin you got dis  marisha oh ill take that 18  and i think my intimidations an eight no its a seven so 25  matt laughs 25  marisha yeah  travis wow  matt so as you asked for their name the chain devil the chains begin to slow and 
none	 come to a  halt and what was originally curling upward in this aggressive stance begin to just fall limp to  its sides and just takes another step back no need to worry we apologize for the intrusion  marisha are you sure because i would love to know maybe add you to the collection  matt the chain devil bows its head and begins to step back and you see it ushering its hand this  way towards the dwarf the dwarf which is looking confused and begins to hobble backward and they  both just back out 
none	 of the alleyway in a very submissive apologetic physicality without even  saying a word  marisha oh whats the matter wherere you going  sam just let em just let em go  marisha and then i turn around and i strained just start walking cool  sam you can fly  marisha whimpers yeah i can fly thats also this is a concentration spell  matt yes it is  marisha so i cant do okay so im going to as i is anyone looking around anyone looking  around right now  matt make a perception check 
none	  marisha god damn it 22  matt 22 you glance up and right on the edge of one of the three to fourstory curved iron  towers you see what appears to be an impishlike creature perched on the end with what looks to be  faint shimmering gold armor thats just peering down at you from the top of the alley  marisha i look at it  sam ooh  marisha and i just nod  matt it doesnt react its head twitches a little bit and it just sets back in itself looking at  you 
tavern	 its eyes these gleaming black shining discs in the darkness  marisha and then i start heading back towards the tavern  matt it just watches you and as you exit the alleyway from where you came the two devils that  attempted to assail you there no longer anywhere in sight the  marisha before i round the corner i want to just take and do a quick shapechange again into the  tiefling that i was  matt okay as your form changes as you turn the corner  marisha into the tavern  matt  into the 
tavern	 tavern yep  marisha go upstairs to the rest of the group  sam nice  travis did you pee on yourself  marisha panicked gasping okay okay  taliesin what what happened howd it go  marisha i didnt make it far i didnt make it far  travis you ate the meat didnt you  marisha woo  liam well how far are we talking about  marisha i made it around the corner and the two devils that seemed to be very interested in you  vax cornered me nervous laugh  liam me  marisha huh 
town	  liam in me why  marisha i have a feeling it has something to do with your deity  liam all right  travis what your deity why  marisha i think they can tell that vax is special i think he has value down here  travis you have value  laughter  liam its the first im hearing about it trust me  marisha they said they were interested in the white one and i couldnt help but notice that  you were turning quite a few heads when we were walking through town  liam well 
tavern	 do you think thats because of the raven queen or is it because of the choice of  appearance i picked i mean weve met an albino tiefling before it didnt seem like that  outlandish a choice  marisha i dont think it has anything to do with the way you looked  taliesin im not entirely sure i mean they didnt react did they react strangely to you  when we came into the bar  liam not that i noticed no  travis so does that mean that he has to change again now  taliesin no 
none	  travis no  marisha i dont think it matters what he turns into i think people will be able to tell the aura  that he carries with him  travis what a bit like a process of divination  laughter  travis  like he changes and then we know what it is or not what  taliesin i think thats actually very impressive it is actually a process of divination  technically thats just very  sam some sound reasoning  taliesin somehow you wandered right back to it  travis dont lose your wits down here 
none	 its real important  taliesin no  liam this is just an extra wrinkle into a larger problem so whats the move now  marisha well i can do this for about another 55 minutes before wed have to sleep before i can do  it again  sam do we have to go anywhere are we late to any appointments  travis i forgot what it was you left to go do actually laughs  taliesin she was going to research the notion of other options other than dealing with the deal we  have downstairs  travis right 
none	  marisha i was going to go see if i could get a bead on where hotis is oh what guys check this  out this is what i freaked em out with and i go back into the erinyes form  matt you watch the wings whoosh unfurl her skin going pale  taliesin all right  marisha deeper voice check it out check it out thats pretty hot right it makes my  sam that is amazing  marisha  it makes my voice a little smokey when im down here too right  sam whoa whoa  
none	 marisha i know  sam what are you right now  marisha im an erinyes  sam how do you spell that doty take that down erinyes  travis how do you say it  marisha its with an e  taliesin erinyes  travis earines  taliesin airines  marisha erin like erinyes  sam wow  liam yeah its got yesbait right in  marisha yeah  taliesin well do you still want to look into other options or do we want to just we could  take the deal we could reverse the deal  travis wait 
none	 you said they like left you alone once you changed into that thing  marisha yes  travis well why didnt you just keep going then  marisha well changing into this thing meant that i had to drop concentration on my  locate creature spell  travis ohh  marisha i can only concentrate on one thing at a time it gets especially this its a lot to  mentally focus on  taliesin its very impressive  sam you know in my readings of this place the hells of any hell really laughs they  typically are at 
none	 least in literature reflected as horrible places where lots of bad things happen  wherever you go so having a deal presented in front of us that is not horrible is i think a  pretty winning deal i mean i feel like were already ahead of the game if we are not being  actively murdered during the course of events  taliesin i would also like to point out that the definition of research in this instance is  just reading the notes that i took last week reading and doing actual research  sam i do my 
none	 own reading thank you  taliesin you did you did reading of the notes i wrote  sam well then i guess were in accord laughs  travis yeah dont you like brainy buddies just like exchange notes every day anyway  sam of course  taliesin i dont feel like i should have lost that one  marisha i noticed  taliesin sighs  marisha just let it go percy i noticed were being watched i think at every turn there was a  little imp guy watching me when i came in  taliesin was it actually an 
none	 imp imps are very common everyones being watched its a city  under surveillance  liam we saw an imp back in kriegs house did it look like that  taliesin gold armor or wasnt that the one at kriegs house  matt it did not have gold armor the one that you saw at kriegs  taliesin which one did we see was it just i dont  liam the little bastard in the library at kriegs house  matt well that was in kriegs technically it wasnt in kriegs house  liam no  matt that was in 
none	 father whats the characters  travis it was upstairs in the  matt yeah it was the first when you first came to emon it was the ally to your father vax  taliesin oh  liam oh thats right  marisha oh shit thats right your dad  matt and he was the one that was found slain or was in the process of being killed by  liam thats right thats right  matt  by entities  taliesin in the basement  matt yeah  taliesin oh my god that was a long time ago  marisha 
none	 a long time ago  liam the slaying right the slaying was in the basement but the imp was in a library upstairs  matt yes yes  liam  in our house and he was just a little prick  travis i forgot about that i kept a ring off that demon that we killed its in the bag of  holding  marisha wait did you really  travis yep  taliesin thats like seven haircuts ago  marisha well get that  sam whip it out  marisha get that can i get that out get that 
none	 out  travis why what do you want  sam might be useful  marisha yeah  taliesin ill trade you something for it  marisha percy  taliesin my glasses  marisha your laughs  laughter  travis you you im not going to fall for that  taliesin it was worth the joke was worth the ring alone i would imagine we were going to give  it back we just want to see it  travis so that big demon that like body slammed me on that spike piece of shit i took this ring  off 
none	 of his finger forever ago and i kept it i take it out  sam lets have a look ill cast identify on it  matt okay the ring has no specific magical properties to it but it is a signet of some kind  there is a symbol on it roll a religion check actually  taliesin can i aid with a history or religion as well  travis sorry thats from like three years ago  sam 19  taliesin can i help with him with that history or religion  matt this would be religion  taliesin 
none	 all right  travis thats one of the oldest things in this bag  matt yeah  travis theres only one other thing thats older  taliesin an 11 on top of that so  matt okay  liam whats the one thing thats older  travis its an onyx statue that we found down in the cell that you were in  matt that he was in yeah so the two of you both conjecturing about it the symbol here is one  that you picked up specifically in the tome you did research earlier it is the symbol 
none	 of  asmodeus  taliesin it is the symbol of asmodeus i would have instantly recognized it at this point  sam asmodeus i was going to say that as well  taliesin you of course you were going to say asmodeus because its like written six times in  my notes and im literally staring at a sketch of it in my notes  matt asmodayus  sam i feel like were sympatico on this  travis can we use it is it something thatll get us like a backstage pass to an  audience of some kind  
dung	 taliesin im going to take a long look at this thing is this some sort of mark of is this a  marker some sort of favor marker is this a signet of stature is this a you dont just put  this on anything  travis its mine dont forget  matt it seems from best you can tell make an intelligence check actually  taliesin all right  sam i should probably assist  taliesin yeah please  travis yep me too  taliesin oh yes please  sam we got two natural ones  matt laughs  
none	 travis 13  marisha did you really  sam yeah  marisha holy shit  taliesin its a nose ring  sam i think its a uh a contact lens  taliesin i think that it is in fact a some sort of i dont know its a napkin ring  laughs for tiny napkins  matt as far as you guys know it looks pretty damn important thats the only thing you can  ascertain  marisha let me let me see if i can get something out of it  taliesin thats fine i dont care  marisha 
none	 can i scry on it  sam scry  marisha like scry and see if it shows me something  taliesin oh object scry  matt let me see  marisha is that a thing i no  matt i mean if you focus on an item you can use that item to try an improve a scrying attempt if  youre looking for a specific individual or location  marisha individual  matt but i dont think the scrying spell directly allows you to to  taliesin there is a spell that does that though object history  sam 
none	 yeah we dont have that  marisha i dont have that  travis if youre curious the person it belonged to is dead  sam oh  travis we killed him  marisha oh i know  taliesin the symbol on this object though is more or less the ruler of this dimension so it  could be useful for something  sam why dont we keep it handy no pun intended and well just flash it if we get in trouble and  see if that helps us  travis how is that a pun  marisha okay  
none	 taliesin i was actually thinking the same thing i dont understand how that was  sam its a ring i said handy  travis thats a stretch  liam i caught it  laughter  liam im sorry to say  sam well are we taking this deal or are we not  travis are we doing it on our own  marisha you know this imp that i saw did have sparkly gold armor he may be like an important  imp im just saying i feel like everyones here wanting to make a deal it might be good 
none	 to talk  to others  liam vex youre being awfully quiet what do you think we should do right now  laughter  travis laughs yeah vex  matt vex at this point is watching the whole thing and she goes well to be perfectly  honest i havent heard much detail about this deal that you apparently seemed to make what do  we make of the deal  taliesin the owner of this establishment were staying in works for a man he doesnt like is  curious what would happen if he wasnt working for that man 
town	 if he was suddenly for reasons  unavailable and for that we would probably be arrested if we dealt with it inappropriately and  we would be in a position to be make our enemy accessible i suppose we have to be a bit cagey  there are ears apparently everywhere even here  marisha i feel like we dont need to make a deal to go murder someone to get arrested i feel like  i could just go streaking in the street and just say words and we would get arrested  taliesin as actually  travis thats 
none	 true  taliesin strangely excited by that plan as i am  marisha why do we need to commit this crime and then suffer the apt consequences  travis yeah but keyleth once were arrested hes supposed to like shuffle us in yknow on  the lowlow into  marisha can he get us out  travis yeah  taliesin well where we need to be yeah out never came up  marisha out never came up  taliesin youre our out we leave all of this behind once all thats taken care of  marisha then why do we 
none	 need him as our in  travis because we have no other plan at this point  taliesin at this point we have no other plan  travis you were supposed to go find something singsong but you got followed by demons  marisha yes i did yes i did i could do attempt something similar potentially with a  higherlevel version of my locate creature spell  travis oh  marisha  which is find the path which could get us close potentially  travis what if the guy he wants us to kill is like a real piece 
none	 of shit  taliesin theyre all pieces of shit  sam everything down here is a piece of shit  travis does anybody have a problem with that its just like yknow piece of shit killing  noise and hes gone  taliesin the only problem i have with it  sam i like it  travis thank you tary  taliesin  and the only reason im even being vaguely hesitant about any of this is because  theyre all pieces of shit including the one that were making any sort of bargain with  travis okay  taliesin 
none	 and they are professional bargainers and i know were missing something  travis we kill him too  marisha its a lawful evil dimension if he wants his boss dead that means that theres going to be  someone else above him if we kill one guy whos all going to want to kill us  travis did he ask like a decision by a certain time  taliesin i dont recall so i said i would have it within a day or so if i recall  matt yeah you said fairly promptly  travis well fuck weve got 
none	 a day lets go explore see what we can find  taliesin and if were going to decide to trust him we could also show him the ring and see what  he makes of it  travis not the ring god not the ring i mean i fuck i totally forgot  about that ring until now  marisha hes literally still holding it in his hand in front of your face you just  travis yeah i need it back  sam what will you do with it  travis me  sam yes  travis im going 
none	 to wear it  sam all right  travis yeah does it fit on any of me giant oscar meyer fingers  laughter  matt it fits partway down your pinkie but it gets caught on like the first knuckle  marisha ooh look at you oh my gosh wow  matt its like he went to claires  travis property of asmodeus assmodeus  taliesin this never ends well lets forego disguises  travis oh wait you ready to go  taliesin were going to just drain ourselves the more we pretend to be something were not and  
town	 obviously its not helping us not attract attention  travis vax you got any problem with that  liam i mean i dont know what the deal is with the people who are interested in me i cant tell  if ones better or worse but were just going to go waltz out into town and see what happens is  that the idea  taliesin well we could keyleth could keep her wings and armor and theyd be probably possibly  less likely to question any of us if were walking around with someone of reasonable stature  sam 
none	 if i might remind you for 50 minutes now at this point now right so then were all dead  taliesin yeah then were all dead  marisha well we just its like curfew we have to be home in about 50 minutes  travis what about you do you have like a magic jock strap you can rip off and change into  something  sam ive already done that were all tieflings because of me  travis not me bitch  sam youre abnormal  travis oh thank you  liam kiki the prison that you saw did 
none	 you get an idea for how big it is  marisha the what the prison  liam the prison that we need to break into or get arrested and pulled into  marisha i didnt see how big it seemed immense and like it was probably pretty big underground  but i couldnt cant be for sure  taliesin i would say it would be safe to assume that a prison in hell would be so big that there  would be sayings such as as big as filling try attempting to fill a prison in hell i feel like

dung	 broken bone and dark purple and bluish flesh and its just tearing into it as ipkesh is at the  same table where you guys previously spoke with him hes sitting there with his same glass of  wine and as you approach he gives a nod towards you and he has a piece of paper on the table  taliesin is this just to peruse  matt he slides it forward have a read see if its up to your preferences  sam may i  matt i will give you the piece of paper actually  sam no

none	 to read the contract out loud  sam no  taliesin yes  sam its so long matt  marisha its so fucking long its got to be at theres like  sam we can well you read too much out loud we will read it out loud  matt okay  sam taliesin take it away  marisha i feel like we should give this to grog laughs  taliesin all right this contract binds the scribe and recipient into a deal  matt hold on a second  taliesin  of chosen escalation for an unending period of 
none	 time or this contract is voided by an  agreement on the part of both parties upon agreeing to and signing this contract the  recipient is bound to their agreed obligations and parameters within the first pact as is the  scribe upon completion of the agreed obligations and parameters on both sides of the initial pact  the first pact is considered complete and concluded  laura this is awful  taliesin the contract as a whole remains until the predetermined period of eternity allowing the  recipient should they feel inclined to invoke and trigger the second 
none	 or third pact any time  thereafter through verbal acceptance in relative proximity of this contract the obligations and  parameters agreed upon within the second or third pact then become binding and immediate to be  fulfilled on part of the both parties within an agreedupon period of time upon completion of the  agreed obligations and parameters on both sides of the second or third pact that pact is considered  complete and concluded this contract remains in effect through all pacts and thereafter  maintaining any agreedupon specifications and obligations that remain outside of a pacts  
none	 completion for eternity big inhale any violation of this contract on the part of the  scribe immediately holds this contract null and void requiring a penalty payment of 15000 gold  pieces to the recipient to be paid immediately any violation of this contract on the part of the  recipient immediately locks the claim and ownership of the everlasting soul of the  recipient invoking the laws of this pact primeval under the control and dominance of the scribe for  all eternity sending the soul of the recipient immediately upon death to the scribe to do with 
none	 as  they see fit first pact the scribe your name here ipkesh  marisha its definitely like an iphone contract  taliesin  agrees to enable safe passage into the depths of mentiri specifically the bastion of  flesh unharmed bastion of flesh the recipient your name here agrees to be the  instrument of assassination leading to the death of utugash  or should a name i will not say  out loud the herald of something i will not say out loud with the revealing or leaving  of evidence that could connect or incriminate the scribe 
none	 in an act or reasons for the act  sam second pact robot voice the scribe ipkesh agrees to  all no  sam laughs normal voice okay the scribe ipkesh agrees to immediately conjure forth a  cadre of devils in service to the recipient thats us  whom shall remain under the command  of and dedicated to the protection of the recipient for the duration of one month we get a  cadre of devils the cadre shall include four hamantula and a single osyluth should any devils  bound within this agreedupon cadre be slain outside 
none	 of baator they are absolved of future  service to the recipient the recipient our name here agrees to introduction and installation of  at least two chosen of dispater who have been selected by the scribe within a place of divine  worship of the scribes choice the recipient must not interfere with this installation upon  completion and any interference will be considered a violation of contract third pact  big inhale the scribe ipkesh agrees to immediately impart the recipient with knowledge of  ancient power beyond their grasp enabling the use of divine powers granted under 
none	 the grace of lord  dispater that can instantly restore themselves or allies to a healthy state ooh we get health  knowledge  or rend the lifeforce from their opponents  marisha at what cost  sam hes giving us magic  marisha at what cost  sam these powers remain within your possession until death the recipient thats us   agrees to immediately lock the claim and ownership of the everlasting soul of the recipient invoking  the laws of the pact primeval under the control and dominance of the scribe for all eternity  sending the 
none	 soul of the recipient immediately upon death to the scribe to do with as they see fit  matt so  sam were selling our soul  matt not necessarily  marisha my favorite line this contract as a whole remains until the predetermined period of  eternity thats my favorite  matt in theory only one person has to accept the contract  taliesin yes  matt to lock this in you only agree to the first pact and when the first pact is complete you do  not have to trigger any of the other pacts the contract 
none	 remains in effect should you ever decide  to trigger the pact it immediately comes into play  sam so second pact is we get a bunch of devils and they get to install two in a place of divine  worship to be determined third pact is we get all sorts of devil magic  in exchange for our souls  travis ill do it  sam so were probably not going to do those pacts laughs  laura just dont do those ones  travis why  liam so like we went in to buy a car and 
town	 hes also offering us a condo and land in florida at  the same time is that about it  matt yeah you dont have to accept  taliesin in perpetuity though  matt yeah in perpetuity so you dont have to decide now on the other pacts but at some point  down the road if youre ever in a situation where youre like oh shit were all about to die i  invoke the second pact boom you get a bunch of devils to help you for the next month  marisha wow  and you just have 
none	 to like say that youre like yo ipkesh i take that second pact  matt you invoke the pact  taliesin so the second pact is we get a bunch of stuff but we have to do what was it the  agrees to introduction and installation of at least two of  sam we have to take two devils and put them in a place of holy worship somewhere in the world  travis right  taliesin okay and then the third pact is our soul  matt yes  taliesin our soul for somebody elses life  liam 
none	 one of our souls or all our souls  matt one person has to sign the contract and only that persons soul  liam oh thats not so bad  laura laughs  taliesin and the first pact the scribe enables safe passage into the depths of mentiri  specifically the bastion of flesh unharmed i feel like thats a little thin  matt well youre and you say this in character laughs  taliesin percy voice i feel like i feel like the first pacts a little thin  laughter  matt well there is room for negotiation of 
none	 course  taliesin thats fair  sam if we have some time i could summon my fathers army of lawyers  taliesin chuckles do they have a branch here  sam no laughs it would take them quite some time to arrive but theyve negotiated tougher  deals than this  taliesin i was strangely hoping that your fathers lawyers had a branch here  that would be  laura appropriate  sam i think they originated here but then they moved to where im from for the tax laws  taliesin i suppose that is a growth industry this 
none	 is interesting im going to think it over  im going to leave it and well be back in the evening  matt very well please return when you have a better idea of what you would like to see  adjusted and i will do the same  taliesin i thank you for your time and patience  matt he takes it and rolls it up and it vanishes below the table as you exit  sam whispers how do we know when its evening here  laura whispers dont whisper here  sam oh sorry very loudly how 
dung	 do we know when its evening here  taliesin dont yell here  laura i dont know can we ask him how do we know when its evening here does it get dark  matt it does not get dark there is no evening here in dis  laura of course nervous laughing of course  taliesin were going to get mugged arent we laughs  marisha mm i mean i already got close  taliesin well lets take a look around  laura does he seem to like notice or care that were not the tieflings anymore  matt 
town	 he has taken a scan of the group but he doesnt seem to be flinching he is just there and  eager to talk some more  travis its vegas man he dont give a fuck  taliesin i think indifference is the common courtesy here to an awful lot  laura all right  matt so as you guys exit the establishment into the street the heated cobblestone still glowing a  dull maroon and black you watch as what looks to be some sort of strange mistlike form emanates  from a crack and turns into a screaming 
town	 specter that gasping  and drifts further down the  street past you  laura lovely  sam they need a tourism board  laughter  sam badly  matt what do you guys wish to do  laura what are we trying to do  sam i dont know  laura were just going to walk around and see if we can sense where this bastion of death is  matt youve got 25 minutes before your spell is up  laura the bastion of death is what were trying to find  marisha the bastion of death is 
none	  matt the bastion of flesh  marisha the bastion of flesh is who he wants us to kill  matt no the bastion of flesh is the safe passage to the bastion of flesh that is what the  contract enables you should you fulfill your part of the deal  laura so thats the prison were looking for  taliesin the mentiri is the prison thats the part of the prison prison has parts  liam tell me how much time  taliesin 25 minutes  liam 25 minutes what can we do in 25 minutes we could 
none	 fasttalk a couple of people  laura could i locate object on the bastion of flesh  matt not an object its a location  travis what about snow cones  laura just going to keep asking  matt laughs you wouldnt be vex if you didnt  taliesin 25 minutes until your spell is dissipated but once it is  we can do locate person  marisha correct i could also do find the path if i have a little piece of the prison if we could  get a little piece of the prison  laura oh no

none	  you dont ask around because  marisha thats bad  matt its a bad idea and you start getting the idea too whatevers coming down they get the  stink eye and you just turn tough gaze and keep walking and eventually you come upon a facility  of some kind that looks to be made of almost pieces of black and rusted sheet metal thats  jammed together in a very patchwork fashion you dont see a doorway more than you see a triangular  opening where the various interlocking pieces of metal arent fully flush from the 
none	 inside you see  a soft reddishorange glow that flickers ever so gently as you glance inside you see a few  makeshift braziers that are flickering with reddishorange fire and what appear to be some  gleaming shelves lining up strange glowing collections  sam going in  taliesin i want to go in  matt okay as you guys enter  travis hands in your pockets tary  sam i have no pockets  travis shit  taliesin its not tary we have to give him a name  sam why  taliesin everyone use code names

none	 so far  that looks to have any sort of loosely welcoming or not heavily guarded dont come in or youll  get killedtype exterior and as you enter the lowlit inside you see these ricketylooking  shelves that contain small glowing gems or crystals of different colors and sizes like  weird geodes that are cut from natural deposits and across the way there is just a stool and what  looks to be some sort of humanoid creature that is slumped forward and breathing heavily with these  elongated dull green color on the skin a series of 
none	 small spines that protrude from the shoulders  and back  sam spines  matt yeah like jagged long thin spines and as you enter inside it turns up and goes  sam wait  matt yes  sam we dont have a code name for him  laura yeah freddie  sam oh freddie okay  travis bidet  matt you come to buy pretties  travis yeah yes  sam no what  marisha thing is im looking for something specific  matt what do you seek  marisha do you have any pieces or remnants or items 
none	 from the mentiri prison specifically from  the bastion of flesh  matt no no i do not go there  marisha why not  matt because it is for fleshy types and he nudges this long jagged chin these gnashing  teeth that are crooked and overlapping as it spits as it speaks in your direction  taliesin charming  marisha where is it located we need in  matt what  marisha and then i slowly start to shapechange just for the erinyes face and i give just a flash  of it we need in and youre 
none	 going to help me arent you  matt make an intimidation check with advantage  marisha fucking hell  matt literally  laura yeah  marisha fucking hell  laura what is it what is it  marisha its a 19 but it was almost bad  laura plus seven  marisha plus seven so 26  matt i do not know the the nature of this city is to be rebuilt always rebuilt aways changing  the archdevil he worries hes paranoid everything must not be the same as it was i know  not where it is i 
none	 know not where the bastion is im sorry  marisha well then how do people get around the city you know  matt those who work those who are within those who are under the guidance of the prisons  masters they know they know  marisha where do i find them  laura whispers the ring  marisha and i show them the ring of asmodeus  sam you dont have it  laura whispers no but she does  sam oh but she doesnt  travis i do  marisha he has it  laura oh i dunno 
none	 who has it the ring  matt its on his pinkie  sam he went to jared  marisha highpitched singing it can only be jared  taliesin jared  matt i can not help i dont know and he just lowers his head in a shameful worrying you can  see his knees are quivering eversogently  laura i want to insight check him to see if he looks like hes  matt make an insight check  laura i feel like he is but i just want to make sure  travis thats good  laura 26 there 
none	  matt okay legitimately this creature is pretty pathetic as far as devils go that youve come  across and in the threatening presence of an erinyes that is asking for information it does not  seem to have it is legitimately awaiting a terrible demotion that it doesnt feel it earned  laura mistress i dont believe he knows  marisha i need a name and location of where to find the information that i need  matt i dont know i dont know  marisha then who does  matt you see him looking around spastically his eyes 
none	 are shooting around the room at all of you  and around looking at the geodes at different directions almost like a weird iguana face he  says the torturers the chains  laura oh shit  marisha god damn it the chain devils all right  travis i mean were in here  taliesin i think we should allow this poor creature an attempt to redeem himself what is it  that you sell here that would please our mistress  matt i sell pretties i sell pretties pretties used for rites used for magic  taliesin please impress 
none	 us  matt he stands up now and this creature that looked so pathetic when it was squatting down on  this stool these long thin gollumlike legs it stands up and is now headheight a good foot over  most of the party gangly the spines extending from the back of the head and the arms and the  elbows as it stands up now as it slowly stalks over to one of the shelves and pulls off one of  these strange purple geodes the various crystals jutting out of different sides and it turns  around and 
none	 brings it forward this this carries pure condensed soul energy geodes robbed her from  the fourth layer as he takes it and holds it in front towards you you look inside and you swear  within the slight glimmers of light that shake through from the nearby braziers you see almost  dozens of faces pressed up against the crystalline interior shifting past similar to that giant  sphere that orb you saw being passed through the city when you first arrived  liam this is insulting skip the small stuff what have you got  matt this is 
none	 what i have got  liam thats it  matt im sorry im sorry he looks to you and looks back mistress im i have this  sam mistress would you like one  taliesin what do you have thats unique expensive is lovely dont get us wrong but were  looking for unique odd  marisha yes i had one of those for breakfast  taliesin so proud of you right now  matt it lumbers over to this far corner and theres a pile of what looks like burlap and  refuse and partially eaten partially rotting away 
none	 chunks of flesh and just rummaging through them  looking over the shoulder with a scattered look and pulls up what looks to be a longdecomposed  and somewhat mummified humanoid arm the fingers are kind of locked up in this way and theres a  small brass bracelet around the center of the wrist  liam now you have our attention  matt he shakes it and you hear it rattling  liam what can you tell us about that  matt you can hear it rattling against the bones and as it shakes one of the fingers snaps 
none	 off  with a poof of dust and hits the ground oh sorry he picks it up and tries to put it back on  but it wont go back on  sounds of disgust  marisha i snatch it from him yrat do the thing  sam i ritually cast identify on the bracelet  matt okay the bracelet essentially acts as a divination beacon its attuned to a secondary  device that can keep watch on this one apparently whoever previously wore this was doing so under  the intent of relaying their travel or experience to somewhere 
none	 else and then  met a very terrible end  sam oh so its useless to us  matt maybe not everything you encounter is going to be useful guys  sam yeah no thats fine thats fine  marisha well its to relay information back to whoevers wearing it or to him specifically  matt to whoever has the other object thats paired with this that  you dont know what that is  taliesin we found a single walkietalkie  laura right yeah  matt essentially  liam tary is that thing working right now  taliesin is 
none	 it working right now  sam i  detect magic on it is it  matt it is magical it is functional  sam as far as i know someone is watching this right now  matt you dont know how old it is or how long its been there but it is magical  sam mistress would you like this  marisha well take it for good measure  sam oh really  marisha i guess  sam okay sure  sam how much would you like for this what do they  marisha i just want this as 
none	 a souvenir for our visit  travis yeah i just want the one walkie talkie that doesnt have a pair  marisha im not going to pay for it youre not going to sell this i want it right  matt you can see the brow furrow and theres a moment of instinctual anger and frustration like  a kid who had his lunch money taken but hes still like angry breathing goes and sits down  on the stool once more the long knobby knees almost jesting up to shoulder height as it sits  its arms draped over 
none	 the front and the fingers dragging across the ground in front as it does as  it looks up take it  marisha i lean forward and i take my erinyes nail and i go around his face and i say consider  this a goodfaith investment  matt yes yes  marisha you will be seeing us again and i take out 20 gold 20 gold  matt he takes it and goes i will be a favor to the mistress  taliesin we hear you utter our description to anyone and you will never see anything again

town	 you and points towards the iron tower  liam thanks  matt as youre about to leave he grabs the back of your cloak and pulls you in points past your  shoulders his long jagged curved claw and you notice as two more of these flying entities that  scoot by one of them perching on a building across the way wearing the golden armor stop and  the whisperers and then pushes you back out of the street and you hear the shifting of metal  behind you as a large slab is shifted to close the front 
none	 of the shop  marisha i use alter self to go to my tiefling form  matt all right  laura i want to keep an eye out for all of those imps in gold  matt okay make a perception check  liam same  laura 24  matt 24 okay  liam 30  laura whoa  matt okay between the two of you looking up there are at the peripheral of your vision and  the bits of the green ash clouds that make up the sky as the occasional flashes of lightning streak  through it 
town	 from within you see the shadows of hundreds of flying entities that seem to be just  running paths keeping watch many just stop and perch for a moment glancing over the street and  then take off again many of them wearing the same gold armor these whisperers appear to be  everywhere and watching everyone there is   laura but theyre not paying us special attention at all  matt there are a handful that seem to be genuinely interested in keeping an eye on you but  you also see other ones that are genuinely keeping 
town	 an eye on anyone else wandering the street  laura okay  liam so the man on top has cast a wide net over this city  matt it seems that way yes  liam theres no way were unseen yeah  marisha as we start are we walking back towards the tavern as we walk i  taliesin take a slightly different route back just to try and see more  matt okay  laura yeah  marisha so it seems one of the lesser devils who is interested in vax might be our ticket in  laura the 
tavern	 chain guys  marisha the chain guys  taliesin can you scry him since youve seen him before  liam thats a good idea  marisha yeah i guess i could  taliesin lets scry ourselves a chain devil  marisha im wondering if worstcase scenario we could always use you as bait vax  laura wode  marisha sorry wode  taliesin wode  liam thanks wade  taliesin its cool brah  marisha party on wode  taliesin party on wade lets scry  marisha we get back okay we gotta get back to the tavern back to

none	 day  thats it  travis so nothing  marisha i got 4thlevel spells and lower  laura balls  taliesin what is the vassalage that is a good question shit  laura welp  travis are they up in we went up to the room right  laura yeah  travis does anybody want to try the meat stuff downstairs  laura no  taliesin no  travis why  laura i feel like its human remains i dont know  travis but you dont know  laura it doesnt look appealing to me grog  taliesin i have 
none	 a very active imagination when i eat  travis i dont ill be right back i go downstairs  matt okay you head downstairs  liam im going to accompany grog yeah  matt okay as the two of you head down you can see theres that one central table to the left  western side of the room that has almost like a trough look to it with the jagged edges  travis yup  matt currently has four imps that are perched on the edge that are just tearing into bits tearing  it off and chewing and 
tavern	 they all stop and look up at you all four at once as you walk down and  they all just slowly chew as you approach and walk into the chamber  travis are they wearing armor and shit  matt no  travis okay good  matt they are not wearing armor ipkesh is present but not at the same table he was earlier  hes currently at the bar area talking with his rotund barkeep  travis hey that stuff right that normal people have can i have like a little plate of it  matt the thick 
none	 greasy guy sits goes oh yeah he looks over to ipkesh winks at you  on the house  travis oh thats very kind of you see look experimenting with new cultures is really quite  nice new tastes and all what does it look like  matt it looks like you know steak tartare where it has that purplishred color to it  travis very red  matt imagine that but theres a series of jagged bone shards sticking out at sections of it like  whatever it was carved off of had been pulverized before it was butchered 
none	  travis mm tenderized  matt yes but with the bone still present within and it is seeping this sludgelike bloody fluid  that is just pooled around it on this iron platter  travis wode would you want any of this  liam you know im going to watch you go first and i put my hand on his arm and say  lets just see how you do and i dont take my hand off  matt okay  travis okay ill take one of the little bones out and i spoon together like a good chunk like 
none	  spaghetti on a fork and i pop it right in  matt okay well there are no utensils  travis no no im using the bone as the utensil  matt using the bone as the utensil okay as you spool it up pop it in and chew its its very  gamey its warm but the flavor its its very ironlike  travis like chewing on pennies  matt kind of yeah and a similar texture the bones do tear into parts of your upper lip  travis ah  matt it hurts  travis ah  matt 
none	 id say in the process of devouring this one bite you do suffer you suffer two points of  piercing damage  travis fucking hell  laura little by little grog  marisha its the little things  matt as youre chewing vax you watch grog squinting his eyes a bit and chewing as bits of  blood begin to dribble down the sides of his chin but a bright red color not the color of the meat  that hes eating  liam hey  travis do i feel high like freddie did when he consumed the little orb 
none	 of   matt no you do not you chew it you swallow it it hurts and grinds its way down hits your  stomach there is a slight numbness to the inside as you eat it  travis hey  matt but thats the most you get  liam you all right you feeling all right  travis yeah it really fights back as you eat it you know  liam whats the aftertaste like  travis it kind of tastes like if you took a bunch of rusty nails and then shoved them in your thumb  and 
none	 then sucked on that for a while  liam huh  travis yeah  marisha that was very specific  travis have you done that before  marisha no but i feel like you have  travis have you not  marisha dont worry about it  travis okay yeah i have another bite  matt all right you bite by bite begin to finish the meal id say for the remainder of it  you suffer another three points of piercing damage but you do  finish the flesh in front of you  travis my plate of flesh 
none	  liam he legitimately seems fine hes all right hes not like veins arent popping out  nothing amiss  matt nope  liam all right  travis my compliments to the chef  matt his already somewhat greasy ruddy cheeks go to a blushing smile thank you  travis that tasted like forearm okay im good wode do you want  to go back up hiccups  stairs  liam yeah i grab a small just a small piece and put it in my mouth  and i spit it out immediately  matt yeah  liam immediately  
none	 matt its pretty awful  liam yeah  laura is it salty  travis its not for everyone yeah cook is right there literally sorry  liam hah yeah lets go back up  travis okay  matt all right you guys head back up so whats everyone doing  laura jeez well i feel like were not getting very far in the city  liam yeah were kind of eatin it in here  taliesin i say we take the contract  travis yeah yeah  sam i hate to say i told you so  taliesin ill take 
none	 the contract  sam no  marisha what percy  laura percy youre not taking this contract  taliesin im the one whos already touched by demonic forces i think i can resist the  temptations of the second and third pact  travis cool  taliesin and i think i know what to add to this i think we need to demand a guide and i think we  need to demand safe passage out of the prison as well and back to our original  plane as best he can  travis yep that sounds right  sam 
none	 i must request that i sign the contract i cant let you do this percy  taliesin all right  laughter  taliesin seems fair  travis yrat that is most noble of you you truly are earning your place here  laura tary thats so kind are you sure you want to  sam unless of course you want to  travis yrat you will be a hero to many  marisha such a hero  laura i mean ive never met a hero braver than you  travis give him a pen  sam i  taliesin we 
none	 dont actually have it with us wed have to go downstairs  laura oh right  taliesin but i will yeah  travis okay  liam i also think freddie that youre more capable of resisting temptation as you say  sorry yrat  taliesin ill say i feel my weaknesses in my heart and i know where they lie and i definitely  know they exist and i nothing in this agreement tempts me i have temptations but they are not in  this contract  liam and besides you have us around you friend  marisha is it 
none	 only because youve experienced these types of temptations before  taliesin i think so and im already i dont know whats going to happen to me when i die  sam wait so youre signing it now i thought i was signing it  taliesin we were messing with you  sam oh  taliesin  but if you feel the urge to actually take it upon yourself  sam well i do think it might actually help me in my future part of it could actually help me  taliesin how so  laura so you would actually sell 
none	 your soul  sam no not that part but i could use a cadre of devils at some point  laura then your soul would be forfeit  sam no no  taliesin no actually not on that one  travis laughs not that one not that part thats pact two  marisha no wed just have to release a couple of devils into the material plane  laura how about no on that  marisha yes i agree  travis holy shit  laura because then wed have to fight them  travis can we please go sign this 
none	 contract  laura i mean we could where in the contract does it say we cant kill them as soon as we  release them  sam nowhere  liam i mean yrat were still easing you in freddie has a little more experience than you and  i think that we can put our faith in that  taliesin im not going to say that im never going to do anything stupid again and i certainly  wouldnt necessarily want you to stop me if i were but im not going to do this sort of stupid  am 
none	 i  marisha percy if you die though doesnt this mean that you forfeit your soul here  taliesin im pretty sure it doesnt if i die before its finished  matt no no if you complete the third pact  taliesin then yes  matt you still live but then when you die your soul is forfeit  taliesin but if i dont complete the third pact or if we dont activate the second or the third  pact then im fine  matt correct  taliesin yeah then theres no problem whatsoever  matt and if by any 
none	 means at any point you break the contract  taliesin oh yeah if we do not kill who were supposed to kill  or if it leads back to him then im  laura so if you die in the process  marisha youre fine  laura no then your soul goes here  taliesin to be fair were already here  marisha that was my question yes but we came here willingly  laura but you could become one of those melty guys  marisha yes  taliesin you know its entirely possible that therell be several creatures fighting 
none	 over my  body when i die and my soul when i die already  laura ill be one of them  taliesin bless you but no seriously i dont know what any of this means  marisha percy weve come here to try and kill a kitten and its already been a massive pain in  our ass we really dont want to come back to try and save your soul  taliesin well youll already be here  laura so dont die  taliesin so we wont die  travis hey cool can we  taliesin and actually 
none	 its not that clear what would happen if i died without completing the  contract i might just get brought back  matt this would be a conversation to have with the scribe  taliesin so yep im going to go down im going to sign it  laura im going to go down with you  marisha talk about talk about the revisions first always get those revisions first  taliesin were doing it  marisha and a new printup  liam with a red pen  matt all right so all of you head down into the main 
tavern	 chamber of the tavern and there returning  to the table where he once sat you see ipkesh no wine glass but the paper folded out in front  waiting patiently with his hands folded in the front  taliesin some quick questions  matt yes please  taliesin i need a guide someone who while is not connected to you can help us find our way  through the city find what we need answer questions somebody with a little bit of the lay  of the land somebody to help not with the actual act obviously but just 
none	 to run us around what  happens to our soul what happens to my soul if i die in the process of this  matt if the rest of your friends complete the contract your soul is fine  taliesin and if we dont complete the contract then  matt if you dont complete the contract you are in breach  taliesin are they in breach or just me  matt just you  taliesin perfect safe passage into the bastion of flesh once were there were on our own  matt once you are there you are on your 
none	 own however i can ensure  that you are brought there unharmed  taliesin with access to our foe  matt i can imagine that can be arranged  taliesin can it be arranged in writing  matt to the extent of my capabilities yes just as you have limitations as do i  taliesin i would be very pleased if we could complete this contract if this contract becomes  null and void not with us getting to the bastion of flesh but with our return to our plane with  our enemy harmed we get what we want 
none	 you get what you want not we get towards what we want  you get what you want  matt but where in this is it fair for me to suffer for your stupidity  taliesin that is a question for the ages isnt it  laughter  marisha that we need on a tshirt  sam we can at least contain in the contract once our foe is dispatched that you will help us  arrange safe passage out of here  taliesin youll help us arrange our own passage we have a way out of this material plane 
none	 we just  need to make sure that were is there anything in the prison that would not allow us to leave  under our own power  matt not to my knowledge no those chambers specifically reside within the iron tower thats  where they imprison the extremely dangerous ones the bastion of flesh is where they keep all the  living mortals that were captured on this plane and not yet fully corrupt  taliesin do they take our possessions before we go in there  matt they would however if you so wish i can arrange to 
none	 have them  maintained in your presence  marisha that would be nice  taliesin that would be quite pleasing  matt as you do that he grabs the paper and pulls it over and just takes his finger and writes it  across and as he does it amends the words in the contract in front of you to include the guide  to lead you to where youre going as well as allowing your equipment to also unharmed and  unspoiled and within your grasp  taliesin that will do you do not have knowledge of whether or 
none	 not our  magics will work in that prison  matt i do not  taliesin thats fair  laura can i insight check him  matt you may  laura 24  matt okay he seems honest you get the sense here he doesnt gain anything if you all fail if  you complete both sides of the contract and then he dies he gets nothing  laura right  matt so  weird skype noises  matt if you were to escape  laura what was that  matt if i dunno  laura it was like an 
none	 old woman was trying to talk to us  matt but yes so you get the sense that the purpose of this contract is in  hopes of eventual corruption  taliesin that seems fair i suppose the last question and this is just my last addendment is  that we own an artifact of this plane we would like it if possible to be identified and for you  not to speak to anyone of what we have or what its worthwhile and to keep our presence  confidential as much as we keep yours confidential mutual confidentiality  
none	 matt i have nothing to gain by revealing your presence  sam is there any way in this contract we could add a clause where you preorder a thousand or so  books to be sold by you here later  matt i can write up a different contract for you if you like  sam no well we can omit that part thats okay  laughter  taliesin i want to can i show him the ring  travis what  taliesin grog would you  sam greg  taliesin greg could you please show him i have to 
none	 sign it with my own name i imagine anyway  can you show him the  travis what you got  sam jared  taliesin your piece  travis oh  matt he kind of leans in and squints hm it is a signet of the cult of asmodeus it is a trifle  here but is used on your plane to assert belonging  taliesin fair  laura mmm okay  sam are you sure you want to do this  taliesin last question the final question  matt yes  taliesin how powerful is the herald of vassalage 
none	  matt the herald is quite powerful the herald resides within his stronghold  taliesin we would have to get into his stronghold  matt you would  laura how many enemies are we talking about fighting as well as him  matt general guarding throughout the stronghold id put it at about a dozen maybe  laura and what sort of forces does he have  matt those are his forces locally he has guards throughout the city but theyre scattered thus  the importance of this is to go in unseen and unheard and if you run into 
none	 resistance squash it  before it can make any noise  laura what kind of devils are we talking about  matt nothing too serious the bearded variety maybe a bone devil maybe two i dont know  taliesin and this creature itself a horn devil  matt oh this is a pit fiend  marisha oh again jesus fuck  sam weve fought oh youve fought those before  laughter  taliesin what is this we  sam well were a team now  matt but utugash is strong but slow slovenly sluggish has reveled in his own opulence 
none	 for far  too long  taliesin whats another dead pit fiend in hell  sam ill sign it  marisha ask about the bastion of flesh  travis do it do it now do it quickly  marisha ask about the bastion of flesh  liam fred get that sign it  taliesin what about the bastion of flesh  marisha well how big is this prison  sam maybe i should sign this i dont want you to corrupt yourself senselessly  travis arm wrestle  liam i push yrat back away from freddie  sam ah  
none	 laughter  taliesin all right  liam youre here enjoy the ride freddie has this thank you  taliesin im signing  laura oh my lord  taliesin i check to see his name is it his real name that is signed  matt i mean it seems to be the contract wouldnt be binding on his end if it wasnt  taliesin mm all right not the full name but enough  marisha not the full name  laura no  sam pdr  travis d rolo  sam highpitched droll  laura musel  matt you dont have 
none	 to write the entire name  marisha laughs musel  taliesin oh no wait its happen no im not doing that  matt laughs well say you do in character  taliesin no ive actually finished it  matt okay as you finish signing the ink kind of flashes and glows and it burns into the parchment  ever so slightly to the point where you smell the scent of just slightly singed parchment it curls  up away from you and into his grasp as he takes it  taliesin whats a devil to a man who fears no 
none	 god  matt hm pleasure doing business now and he snaps his fingers and you watch kind of apparate  on one shoulder one of the imps that you saw earlier  laura gasps oh those little guys  matt  when you arrived that kind of saw you and rushed out when you were coming downstairs it  appears on his shoulder this is vasa he will be your guide  all vasa  sam with an r or with an h  laura well that sounds familiar  matt vasa vasa  laura of course our father would 
none	 be named after a fucking imp  matt vessar is your last name vasa is different  laura sounds close efuckingnough  taliesin whitney warned me it would come to this  marisha who what  taliesin its my sister you never met her  matt vasa will guide you thankfully the stronghold is near the torture pits so there is  general din and sound and agony to surround so that might offer you some solace in being unheard  but be careful  taliesin any advice would be welcome we want what you want  matt i know 
none	 rest prepare enter where is easiest always the path of least resistance get  the jump surprise and silence when its time to leave i can help you travel mostly unseen should  you avoid some of the more piercing eyes of this domain  taliesin would you know where to get a silence spell out of curiosity  matt i can provide maybe one or two  taliesin one would be two would be even more helpful  matt very well rest ill be here waiting  laura if no one sees us kill him how will we be 
none	 arrested  matt dont worry ill know when hes down as im sending vasa along with you  laura all right  matt and once this is known just wait because the alarm will call the guard specifically the  ones that work for me  laura all right  marisha oh shit  laura so we should make sure after we kill this big guy not to kill anyone else that comes for us  matt no one that seem to be under his employ no otherwise clear them out  laura okay perfectly simple  sam lets go

none	 water here is hot  taliesin thats fair  laura im going to sit the boar meat down on the ground and cook it a little bit  matt and actually it cooks pretty easily there are portions of the iron metal especially on the  bottom floor that cook it pretty well  taliesin im going to use the gun barrel to sear it a bit  laura yeah make some grill marks on that thing  matt all right and you manage to cook a decent and the boar meats been frozen for a while so  its 
none	 not the best but its better than bone splinter meat chunks  laura or eating souls  travis dont judge it until you try it  laura did that use up all of the boar meat or am i down to like a quarter of a boar meat now  matt how much did you have  laura half a boar meat i have no idea what that means  sam half a boar  matt half a boar meat half a boar between all of you guys including grogs appetite id say  thats about it  laura its

none	 portion it is empty and the imp vasa is currently resting on the  shoulder of ipkesh as you approach  travis close it down for a bit did you  matt just to be safe best not to have individuals knowing of our present arrangements or  your group exit applying to me  liam youre going to introduce us to your little friend there  laura he did its vasa  liam i know his name thank you  matt vasa will be able to bring you to your location vasas mastery is in not being seen and 
none	  keeping beneath the eyes of the whisperers vasa will not be able to aid you in the confrontation  for vasa is as strong as the parchment you signed yesterday  taliesin any luck on those other materials silence spell or two  matt mmhm and he pulls from a small satchel on the side of his long black and purple robe  this small leather case that is locked on one side and as he pulls it open and reveals this  very very tightly wound piece of parchment and he hands it over this is a silence 
none	 spell i  could not procure two unfortunately but this will aid you  laura the whisperers you speak of do they see through illusions  matt the whisperers they do not see through illusions but they do see through invisibility  laura all right  matt at least not all of them the bigger ones if you see any that are larger than our  winged compatriot here those are the ones to avoid  laura okay i feel like a good idea would be to just  sam go  laura yeah but i mean cant we just 
none	 alter selves into little bugs or something and get in  behind him surprise him  sam no its not a polymorph spell  marisha i could animal shapes us there yeah  taliesin how many of us  marisha all of us  taliesin then youd be down a spell  marisha eighth level but it could be worth it to not be seen and get the drop  taliesin do you think that sounds like a reasonable plan or do you think thats  matt that sounds if that is within your capability that sounds very reasonable  
none	 laura and vasa could get us into the keep as insects  matt vasa could show you the way in yes  laura could be good  sam are we yeah are we wasting spells just to get there  laura a spell but its a surprise attack  marisha i imagine wed get there do animal shapes to get through and get to him  laura and then pop out and attack him right from bugness  marisha yeah bugness everdeen  travis okay that was sour  laura i liked it  marisha thank you laura liked it 
none	  liam with the right conditions if we keep quiet i can lay some pretty heavy hurt on this guy at  the getgo if we keep quiet  sam all right lets bug it up then  matt so this is animal shapes into a what form are you taking  taliesin are we doing it now or later  marisha later not now  matt right but what form are you taking  marisha let me figure that out whos got a players handbook in the house  sam right here 20 foot radius centered on a point 
none	 not on a object  marisha animal shapes what are you looking at  taliesin this is us looking at silence spells  matt animal shapes basically you guys can become a large or smaller beast  marisha large or smaller beast so i cant do anything  laura we cant be insects are those beasts  marisha  microscopic  matt micro no  marisha not microscopic but tiny i cant be tiny  matt i mean birdsize would be about as small as you could get  marisha birdsize  travis boy that sure sounds like food  
none	 laura yeah are there any other creatures here that are small that go unseen the size of rats or  birds of some sort  matt i mean there are fiendish variations and there are rats that exist on this plane though  life for them is not very enjoyable  laura well shit  travis we would be running on the blazing hot ground  laura oh right poor little burning rats  travis and flying in the impcovered air  sam didnt he say vasa can get us there right can get us safe passage  laura fuck 
none	 it i was just thinking it was a thing but forget it  travis its all in the contract  matt so shall vasa guide you  laura yes lets do it  matt very well taps the edge and vasas been watching goes come follow me and takes off of  the side of his shoulder  laura he talks  matt you guys have spoken with an imp before and the imp fwsh out the window grabs onto the side  of the doorframe and then scurries onto the outside and turns back around and looks inside  
town	 come come  travis we go we follow  sam i will lead us  travis do we need pass without a trace  laura yeah i cast pass without a trace on us  marisha im alter selfing into my tiefling form  matt all righty that being the case you guys step outside onto the street and you watch as vasa  disappears down the same alleyway that you previously had nearly been assaulted in keyleth  you guys i need you all to make stealth checks  taliesin with advantage  laura yeah no add ten  
none	 marisha thats good  travis motherfucker natural 20  matt jesus  travis two in a row  taliesin 30  sam 24  marisha 38  liam 44  laura 39  matt all right so for the first leg of this journey as youre watching as vasa is darting  from edge to edge and occasionally almost dematerializing and turning invisible and for a  moment you have to stop and look around and then you watch his form appear off in the distance and  shoot up a tiny little lit flare to gather your attention once 
none	 any large whisperers pass overhead  and this process of rubberbanding behind vasa continues over the next half an hour or so going  deeper and deeper into the city and as you go vex youre keeping a pretty close watch on where  youre coming from though youre also seeing large groups of lemures which is how its  pronounced as ive been corrected and im so glad its pronounced that and not lemurs because that  sounds awful as hell its lemure  marisha but lemurs are so cute  matt i know and theyre not cute theyre 
town	 horrible fleshy tortured souls  liam thats my nickname man dont shit on my nickname  marisha lemurs  matt you see clusters of lemures throughout the city as well as lowlevel spine devils and some  other fiendish creatures that are in the process of rebuilding and reconstructing buildings and  tearing down others you start seeing elements of the city are constantly in a state of being  restructured rebuilt sometimes more grandiose sometimes more awful and terrifying and you get  the sense that the city is in a perpetual state of flux that gleaming iron tower 
none	 still just beyond  your visual sight whenever you have to readjust your vision across the horizon i need you guys to  all make another stealth check for these different steps of the journey  travis 25  marisha 29  sam 16  travis with the plus ten  sam mmhm  laura 22  taliesin natural one  marisha no percy  travis come on golden snitch  marisha come on freddie  taliesin there was something about that coffee cup being there there we go  liam can i share some of my 37 with percy 
none	  matt doesnt so as you guys are moving along watching vasa vasa eventually gets out of sight  for a moment and you all stop and pull back and you see a flash of light that signifies vasa  calling you forward and that its safe and as you all move forward you watch as taryon and percival  were both looking behind keeping watch on your back and by the time they look back you guys are  already about 20 feet ahead and as they rush forward percival straight up his foot hits the  edge of 
none	 where two of the iron rifts in the ground the plating that meets up this part of the  alleyway he stumbles forward landing hard on his elbow and giving out a groan of his breath and  as he does you hear a imp sound and you watch as a small impish creature in golden armor begins  to crawl over the roof of the nearby building and look over the side  taliesin i turn and break away from the group and head in a slightly different direction for a  moment and sit and nurse my elbow 
none	 and try and just look like im dealing with my medical issue  and really try to look like i didnt notice the thing thats watching me now  matt okay i want you to go and make a deception check no you have to roll if its intentional  laughter  taliesin meh deception  matt yeah  taliesin nine  matt nine okay so you watch the creature imp sounds and slowly crawls along the top of the  roof as you go and split off from the rest of the party you hear behind you the imp 
none	 talking some  sort of conversation and then a second one appears and one continues to follow you while  the other one continues to move with taryon  taliesin do i have any of the soul  sam did i see him break off  matt yeah you watch as after he gets back up he breaks off from the rest of the group  sam im going to stick with him  matt okay so youre both now being followed by two of these  taliesin one moment im going to pull out a piece of the soul 
town	 the edible soul and just about  to eat it  liam do the rest of us see this by the way  matt you all just made it past this open walkway in the street turned around another alley and  you watched this happen across the way theyre about 15 20 feet from you in an open road  liam im going to quietly follow behind the imps  matt the imps are on the other side of the road from you right now if you want to you can try in  a moment  liam oh 
none	 never mind  taliesin im trying something ive got the shard of soul out the soul shard giving it a smell  and im going to not quite loudly but with a bit disgusted sound and im going to huck it in the  other direction with distaste  matt okay one of the two imps breaks off and swoops down after it and immediately runs over  and starts scattering across the ground trying to catch it as it tumbles off of the side the other  one continues to follow after the two of you  taliesin can 
none	 we try and give it the slip  sam i can try to make us invisible  taliesin it wont work  sam it wont work  laura they see through invisibility  sam all right  matt the bigger ones do  laura i thought you said the whisperers saw through invisibility  matt some of the whisperers do some dont he said be wary of the bigger ones they see through  invisibility and possibly other things  laura okay  sam what do you think  taliesin im going to dust myself off and try and just 
none	 meander into a shadow i still have pass  without a trace  matt you do yes  taliesin im going to see if i can just vanish stealthily  matt okay make it with disadvantage because you are being actively watched  taliesin i am being actively watched  matt you can turn around the corner and attempt it but you know it is aware that you walked  there so your ability to slip out of its view once you break from its line of sight is going to  be this check  taliesin im also going 
town	 to can i also use my boots of spider walking to see if i can crawl off  the street a little bit and see if i can  matt sure lets try it go ahead and make your stealth check  travis you can certainly try  taliesin disadvantage i hate disadvantage so much thats cocked it doesnt matter though  its awful yeah never mind i fail  matt okay so as you turn around the corner you step onto the side of the wall hearing the impact  of the boots across the iron side thankfully its 
none	 enchanted boots so the damage is relatively  minimal but you do hear the very faint sizzle of leather on hot metal what are you doing tary  sam well i will cast invisibility on myself  matt all right  sam and thats all i can do for my turn  matt so as this one is following percival around the corner the one that was going after you that  was distracted by the stone you turn invisible and it glances around and has lost sight of you  for the moment and it continues to push after 
none	 percival  sam im going to stick with percival but in an invisible way  taliesin im just im going to keep talking over the headphones trying to keep up with where  everyone else is but walking off a block in the hopes of sort of bullshitting my way through this  matt as you head down this alleyway and you guys are parallel following on the side watching this  from a distance but staying out of sight without making yourselves visible percival you look up  and you see this strange eerie green glow that begins to 
town	 drift in your direction you watch as  these spectral arms begin to drift up out of the ground and this elongated horrifying face pulls  up from underneath the darkened cobblestones of the street and this specter entity  drifts in your direction  taliesin do i recognize what this specter entity is  matt its some sort of a ghostlike creature youve seen a number of these emanating and  drifting through the city some in small clusters some individually  they seem to wander aimlessly throughout  sam i am whispering the incantation for invisibility into a 
none	 coin  matt okay that takes a minute to do it  sam it does fuck then im not doing it  taliesin im going to try and keep pace with that thing is it following me  matt you glance over your shoulder and see it and it is currently crawled around the side and its  leaping from these windowsills these small iron squares that are about that big that are built  into the side of these walls here its leaping and flying from section to section staying  immediately 15 feet 20 feet behind you  
none	 liam can i trail this thing  matt do you want to go and follow  sam you said 20 feet behind us  matt its about 20 feet behind you yeah  sam and up  matt yeah about 15 feet up  sam all right im going to reach into my alchemists satchel and pull out a bag of writhing  sticky black tar and hurl it right at his feet  matt okay its leaping from windowsill to windowsill and as it gets to one windowsill you  chuck at it  sam yeah  matt all 
none	 right go for it roll for an attack  sam what is this plus my spell attack bonus no its just an attack what is this  matt it should say under your ability here ill pull it up if you want  sam am i rolling for the throw or for the spell  matt this is for the throw or is it the creatures saving throw which is it which of the  two let me go look actually  taliesin i just had five of the worst rolls ive ever had in a row that was just 
none	 ugly there was  just ugliness happening and i dont feel its gone yet its not the dice its in me  matt this is the tanglefoot bag  marisha thats what happens when you sell out man  taliesin shut up  matt so what you do is it splats against it and you watch it choking noise it gets stuck and  sapped into it its moving now at half pace its having to pull through this substance thats glued  to its feet and its trying to tear away  sam okay  matt all right  
none	 sam thats all i got  liam i got a 46 on stealth can i  matt you turn around the corner now and you see first off taryon appears because when you throw  the bag it breaks your invisibility  sam its an attack  matt yeah  sam shit okay its worth it  matt so now you see percival and taryon both appear and this one impish creature is now  currently partially glued to a wall and is fighting trying to pull its way out  sam lets run  liam it looks like a 
none	 target whisper  matt okay  liam with a 46 stealth  matt yeah so go ahead and roll  taliesin thank you  liam would this be a surprise if im that stealthed  matt no it is aware that there are threats in its vicinity so its not a surprise attack but  it does not see you so you have advantage on the attack it is considered a  sneak attack if you hit it  liam 25 to hit  matt yeah that hits  liam all right 12 and i will do a second attack 
none	 as well  matt how much damage is the first attack  liam 12  matt 12 damage its sneak attack because it didnt see you  liam oh wait no it is sneak attack right thanks 12 25 27 33 35 42 plus psychic  damage from that 42 so 45  matt so right as its pulling away from this tanglefoot bag this explosion of glue its like  rasping noise and the dagger just slips through it and you watch as it goes in four different  pieces and retracts into the tanglefoot bag muck once more 
none	 it got completely shredded and the  sections are withdrawn back and stuck to it as it is slowly now dribbling out of this massive glue  on the side of the building which is now starting to bubble from the heat  from the side of this structure  all tar pits  taliesin im going to take this opportunity to try and turn another corner  matt okay the impish creature that was distracted by your stone is now attempting to  catch up i want the three of you to make one more stealth check since  
none	 youve all revealed yourselves  marisha come on dont fuck up percy dont fuck up its all right  taliesin 23  sam 24  liam 37  matt okay you guys darting into the shadows rush around the corner you hear in the distance  the clattering of tiny imp claws and the impacts of it doing the same perchtoperch gliding  through the alleyway you turn the corner and join up with the rest of the party you hear in the  distance some sort of a distant barking call in the language you dont understand  travis 
none	 oh like raptors  marisha i was going to say jurassic park  laura theyre going to be the lookout now  matt you gather that theyve acknowledged that there has been a whisperer slain in the alley so  you might want to hurry  all yeah  matt as you guys collectively catch up with vasa and are led further into the city you begin to  hear now this horrible grinding sound of metal that becomes omnipresent farther down this  labyrinthine network of alleys and streets you can see the glow of red and orange that 
town	  previously just emanated from the horizon is now beginning to light the sky around you its this  light pollution from some sort of nearby source as you turn one of the corners you look and see  giant pyres of molten metal and fire there is a gargantuan forge where people are i say people  these devilish entities and hundreds of lemures are just heaping large bits of iron ingots and  scrap metal from fallen buildings and tossing them into this forge every time they do theres a  burst of flame and ash and cinder 
none	 come pouring out of it from there you can see refined metals  being pulled out and brought to other elements of this city beyond that as you glance over you  can hear this faint echoing sound of hundreds upon hundreds of voices all moaning screaming  squealing in torturous pain you dont have a view of whats causing it but this whole area of  this city just brings this terrifying presence of all the torment youd expect from somewhere in the  hells as you pause a moment vasa darts back trying to usher you forward in 
town	 the direction of  the sound come come follow and then vanishes once again appearing on the other side of the  street and then beckoning you once more for the last leg i need everyone to make  one more stealth check  travis come on percy for fucks sake  marisha all of us  matt all of you  taliesin better  sam 22  travis 23  marisha 34  taliesin 27  laura 26  liam 37  matt okay as youre waiting for the right moment to cross the street you wait for one 
dung	 cluster of  these tiny winged not quite imps theyre a little larger than imps with this dark  bluishgreen spine protrusions out of the wings and their heads are these giant bony ridges that  go back and they have these long spears and about two dozen of them come down this street in a  vast cluster almost like a bat storm a whole bunch of just randomly flying and angrily  screeching creatures and as you wait for that to pass the minute that sound goes past you dart  across the alleyway and make it to 
none	 the other side and turn just in time for the large heavy  footfalls of what looks to be some sort of monstrosity multiple arms that are stitched to  this large golemlike creature its humanoid but its about 15 feet tall and its just covered in  stitches multiple chunks of different faces that are all just sewn together in places you can see  this series of gems that are imbedded in its shoulders and part of its throat that all pulse  like separate heartbeats that are out of pace with each other and as it stumbles 
none	 forward you see a  chain around its neck and its being dragged by this tiny imp thats just pulling it forward and  tugging on it it doesnt even make much of a noise other than a perpetual gurgle but its just  some sort of fleshstitched automaton thats being dragged forward to its next physical activity at  the behest of whoever owns it  laura freddie you cant end up here  taliesin no  matt a few moments later vasa brings you to the outside of a large jetblack metallic and stone  structure a heavy 
none	 thickwalled stronghold with a series of what looks like imagine a thick  bramble forest made of twisted iron that surrounds the base of it about five feet high there are  small gaps where you guys can try and squeeze through for the more lithe folk grog youre not  quite sure how youre going to get over this without tearing bits of you apart theres about a  ten foot gap between this strange metal bramble fence and the outside of this stronghold  laura after i go through stay here i pop trinket out and then i 
none	 reach my necklace through  and say get in  travis okay  matt grog you get inside you release him out on the other side  laura i put trinket back in  matt all right well done  travis whoa that was easier than i thought  matt at which point you now have doty on the other side just going smashing noises  travis you can put doty in there i farted while i was inside  laura i dont think doty can go in there its only for living creatures i can try  get in 
none	 doty  taliesin tell doty to get in  matt no effect  laura nothing  taliesin tell doty to get in maybe  sam doty try your best to get in  laura no no no  sam its fine ill cast fly on doty  laura dont you think thats going to be noticeable  sam how high up is it  travis its only five feet high  sam wait dont we have a magic carpet or something  laura yeah but were trying to be stealthy  sam stealthy with a robot  liam he can 
none	 just edge along the top of the iron yeah  matt you guys have been good enough to keep far enough ahead that this wandering metallic  automaton about 25 feet behind you hasnt drawn any strange attention yet  marisha are there fissures steam vents  matt no steam vents that you can see its just this tangled mass of thick metal cables maybe  about a foot thick that have spikes jutting out of them its climbable but there may be some  damage taken in the process  laura he said take the easiest way in  
none	 sam he said that  laura yeah  taliesin yes  sam well then doty go straight through  matt doty then reaches out and metal noises and it takes a few moments but doty begins to actually  force the brambles apart and you can see bits of the metal clinking and bits of the spikes  jutting through and breaking parts of the armor from the opposite side and are piercing it it  does manage to pull enough of an opening where doty squeezes through and gets to the other side  however doty does suffer 12 
none	 points of piercing damage in the process but emerges  sam youre so badass doty good job  taliesin perhaps we should bend them back  marisha yeah how noticeable is the bent bars  matt its pretty noticeable its about that big around  taliesin can doty put it back  liam is it dotyshaped  travis ill do it  marisha go grog  matt roll a strength check  travis 15  matt it takes you a little bit of time and you manage to squeeze it together  laura plus you put the gauntlets on which 
none	 are good for structures right  matt you do take three points of piercing damage thats essentially why hes able to do it on a  roll of 15 because of his siege ability you do manage to squeeze it back together  and close the hole  travis nice  taliesin magic carpentry  matt now vasa you see is now up on the side of this wall and this stronghold has nearly no  openings on any other side however there is a small sliver of an opening its almost like an  exhaust on the higher end 
none	 there and vasa is currently perched up onto it  sam how high  matt about seven feet up  sam and how wide is this door  matt its about a foot and a half high and about two and a half three feet wide  laura great  sam we want to get into this place right  laura yeah  sam well then lets have a door and i will pull my a door out of my robe of useful items and  it put it on the side of the wall  travis you do what 
none	  matt he pulls a patch out off of his robe and tears it off and slams it against the stone as it  does you watch as what was once solid black metal a tiny seam of orange appears in a large  rectangular pattern and then opens ever so slightly on a hinge that  wasnt there before  sam after you  taliesin well thats my kind of ridiculous  liam hes not the hero we wanted but hes the hero we need  laughter  sam this door cost a lot of money just so you 
dung	 know  laura good to know  matt as you guys peer inside ever so carefully do you guys want to  laura very carefully i want to just peek in  matt make a perception check  marisha do we still have pass without a trace on  matt and laura yeah  laura ah nah i dont see shit  matt it is very dark inside theres a faint bit of almost like candlelight out of view you can  see theres a shifting glow internally that seems to have a life of a small flame  liam 
none	 i gently push my sister to the side and try the same  matt make a perception check  liam yeah 24  matt okay as you glance inside of it you can see theres a series of chains dangling from the  ceiling carrying hooks on them a number of these hooks seem to have a dried reddish caked  bloodlike material some of them have bits of flesh still stripped and dangling from them there  are two tables in this chamber each table seemingly containing some sort of a humanoid body  that is placed on it 
none	 and strapped down one appears to be in two pieces there is a torso and  there are legs and the center piece that once held the parts together is nowhere near in sight  too shadowed to make any details from this angle as youve just peered past the door but there  does not appear to be any other moving or living creature in the chamber that you can see  liam so none of those forms are moving breathing anything as far as i can tell  matt as far as you can tell  liam yeah 
none	  matt you take a moment longer and you see the one on the far table is breathing  liam all right we have some deadish things in here kind of moving  laura dangerous things or  liam it looks like it id like to go in and get a closer look is everybody cool with that  matt all right roll a stealth check  liam thats fine thats 40 with the pass without a trace  matt okay as you slowly slip into the chamber closing the door ever so slightly to make just the  faintest 
none	 creaking of metal on metal you slip into the chamber and you can see theres shelves with  various torture instruments just strewn across it it looks like a terrible nightmare version of  percys work chamber back in greyskull keep there are two doors in the room one on the north side  and one on the eastern side and the body thats on one table you can see appears to be human  older male there are signs of some sort of physical scarring on the body whether it be  necromantic or corruptionbased it has been long 
none	 dead there is a very strong smell of decay the  other table you do see the slight moving chest of a living dwarf a female dwarf that appears to be  passed out unconscious and has suffered quite a bit of torturous wounds you can see hundreds of  small scratches and jagged dagger wounds in the side of the shoulders and arms the face and is  currently strapped down to the table  liam im going to use divine sense in this room am i within 50 60 feet of that dwarf  matt you are yes 
none	  liam yeah divine sense  matt divine sense to sense  liam presence of strong evil registers on my senses  matt within 60 feet of you all right nothing coming from that dwarf but there are a number of  other sources throughout the fortress not in the room but within 60 feet of you you get a view of  the chamber to the north of you and a chamber to the east of you the eastern chamber nothing the  chamber to the north of you just beyond that door there is a signature  liam 
none	 and the dwarf appears alive  matt yes  liam yeah theres a woman dwarf in the room ahead of us  laura is she dangerous  liam hard to say i dont think so but i dont know  marisha does she look familiar  sam why dont we go in and look  matt you guys all quietly make your way into the chambers  laura so quietly  liam im going to inch ahead of everybody  matt okay  travis does she look like she regrets her decisions in life  laura does she look like 
none	 she belongs here is she naked  sam does she have any unfortunate tattoos  matt shes not naked shes wearing basic cloth clothing but a lot of it has been torn and soaked  deep deep crimson with blood a lot of it appears to be torn from stress and tension there are claw  marks from all over this chamber from various demonic entities that have torn through here but  the table shes on as well  laura i go join my brother  taliesin i think this is a brilliant opportunity  liam i mean shes 
none	 not melted like the poor shits weve seen all over this city  matt the body suddenly stirs on the table  sam hello  laura are you awake  matt noelle if you want to step on in  taliesin what  travis oh no  laura oh shit  laughter  sam that just took like ten minutes to find her  travis come on in come on in  taliesin before we do this can we have a tenminute discussion about whether or not to  laura youve been sitting there this whole damn time  noelle 
none	 oh no you guys were shopping i get it  laughter  sam already sass  noelle it was just some light torture  laura oh shit what if she wouldnt have been tortured if wed gotten here earlier  sam by the way for any future guests who want to come on the show we dont normally treat our  guests this way  taliesin theres actually three more guests still waiting in line  sam theyve been here for weeks  noelle it was horrible  matt you hear a noise and as you come to in the 
none	 darkened room with just the faint glow of the  candelabra in the corner you glance over a dart and you see a series of shapes filtering in from a  door that you havent noticed before in the chamber and begin whispering to each other and  then looking over to you occasionally one of them suddenly goes hello and the rest go shh  laura are you alive  sam hello  noelle i just sigh heavily and i go who the fuck are you  taliesin im going to gingerly go over and very quietly say we 
dung	 are a remarkable opportunity if  youre willing to be quiet and maybe have a little faith in the truth in this very dark place  noelle okay  laughter  sam shes bleeding from her eyes  matt as you get a close look at her too you see she has darker auburn red hair with a shock of  whitegray in it shaved on the sides one gnarled ear that has been chewed and torn and a series of  scratch scars across the front of her face  sam i will grab a healing draught and offer 
none	 it  laura i can cast cure wounds on her  travis lets not fight just heal her  laura i just want to know if its safe to heal her  taliesin heal her  laura how did you get here  noelle thats a pretty long story  sam weve got nothing but time  laughter  laura is it safe to release you  noelle yes can i get off this table please what are we doing  sam is she lashed to it  matt she is manacled to it both ankles and wrists are manacled

none	 noelle i just want to spit on it i hate that guy its my least favorite one  matt a big old thick bear loogie onto the corpse as it slowly turns into a liquid it steams as it  falls into the cracks and crevices of the stone floor all right  noelle bye motherfucker  matt thats tovas turn that guys gone this lemure 15 foot of movement another one comes up  behind you but it has to use all of its action to get to you these creatures are not very dangerous  if youre far 
none	 away as that shambles forward another winged creature turns the corner  inspecting the sound and as it turns the corner and sees you taryon shouting as you ran forward  with the spear and the creature right as youre about to attack gets slashed in half in front of  you robbing you of your glory you turn the corner and see another winged humanoid this one  female with a very intense scowl on its face you can see the fanged teeth out of its mouth and  points towards you i need you to go ahead and 
none	 make a wisdom saving throw with advantage  sam 18  matt 18 okay you feel an influence begin to press into your brain drawing you into a strange  brain space and you clench your eyes and force it out your will strong enough to resist the effect  upon seeing this fail and your vision go clear it glances about and sees everyone else charging  into the room and then backs up again into the chamber this way that far with the rest of their  movement and thats as far as they get  marisha i 
none	 feel like were alerting the whole god damned house  taliesin we gotta eventually get a candle on this  marisha a handle or a candle  taliesin a handle and a candle  matt that brings us to vax  liam all right i cant see too well from here so from where i am crashed in front of my  sister do i see the lemure  matt you do  liam all right and am i within 60 feet  matt you are indeed  liam im going to chuck whisper at it  matt all right 
none	 i will say if you dont move grog is blocking a large portion of this space so  ill give you disadvantage on the attack even though the creatures very easy to see  liam im sharpshooter so only full cover affects my attacks  matt fair enough so go ahead youre unaffected  liam i got a 22  matt 22 it hits go and roll damage  liam okay and im going to bamf there on this and grog is right up against it  matt yes oh grog is not grog is about ten feet away from 
none	 it  liam is anybody right next to it  matt tovas right next to it  liam all right so thats sneak attack damage so that is four plus eight is 12 plus psychic  damage thats 19 plus the sneak attack damage is 22 26 27 32 37 40 44 total  matt okay you eviscerate the lemure you watch as you jam your dagger through it multiple times  and each section you carve off of it it splits open leaving these stringy tendrils of flesh and  tendon behind as it wails and shrieks to the 
none	 ground slowly dissipating into a thick sludge  liam for my new vantage point do i see the winged creature that you had referenced  matt make a perception check as you make a glance around the room  liam that is 24  matt 24 you unfortunately do not  liam all right i am going to use my bonus action to hide if i can i should have full movement can  i back into a corner of the room  matt you do yes you can you can back into that corner here and go ahead and 
none	 roll your stealth  liam sure thats a 40  matt okay well you dont get the plus ten  liam oh 30  matt because you already cast hunters mark which got rid of pass without a trace so 30 but  good to know vex youre up  laura all right i come running forward and as im running forward i bamf trinket out of the  necklace  matt thats as far as you can get there and then trinket emerges in the chamber next to grog goes  over and is right next to the destroyed 
none	 corpse of the devil humanoid earlier the face smashed in  travis eat it  laura can i say are we in the clear is everyone safe  matt guys you all hear vex say that  travis no theres one running  laura trinket go after it which way did it go  travis down the hallway to the right left direction  taliesin that was helpful that was two out of four possible answers  matt trinket does manage to just catch up with it  laura oh shit hes going to try to attack it can he 
none	 do that  matt yeah he can  laura all right fuck hes going to jump on it  sam double bear action bear on bear action  taliesin really dont google that  sam two bears wrestling with each other  laura 28  matt 28 hits yeah go ahead and roll damage  travis thats a really good roll for trinket  laura i know  matt are you using your action to give him a double attack  laura yeah  matt okay because youre not actually attacking anything so go for it so its two attacks 
none	 so  the first ones damage  laura okay first ones damage would be 14  matt 14 all righty  laura and the second one is 26  matt 26 hits  laura and thats eight plus nine is 17  matt 17 there you go so look at that so trinket rushes in with a double swipe as soon as  the creature backs around the corner and it goes to turn trinket comes rushing around the corner  and tears into it with a claw and a bite into this female devil who is pushed into the 
none	 wall and torn  into the chest terribly you guys just see and hear this in the distance you dont actually  watch the impact happen but you hear the screaming and trinket roaring  as it strikes into it  laura shit well thats loud hey buddy try to stay quiet  matt you get the sense that its going to be real hard to try to maintain a sense of stealth in this  stronghold now so that ends your turn grog youre up  travis i run after  laura i use my bonus action to hide 
none	 as well  matt okay go ahead and roll a stealth check  laura unless letting trinket out of the necklace does that count as my bonus action  matt actually id probably say its a bonus action yeah grog  travis i run after winged shebitch  matt not an issue you get up there right with trinket well say for the purposes of this tiny  alley youre in an uncomfortably close due to your both massive sizes you have to move to the  side around trinket and come down with the hammer if you want  
none	 travis yeah two please reckless 33  matt that hits  travis okay oh i reroll that because thats a one thats a two 18 18 points  matt 18 points of damage all righty  travis reckless 36  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  travis 23 points of damage  matt all righty as you slam into it multiple times the hammer reaching around the side of  trinket its being pushed against the wall and you can see she has this giant slash mark on the  chest a big part of the neck 
none	 has been torn out and you start bludgeoning her on the side of the  shoulder and shes growling noises is really really frustrated that ends your turn grog  taryon youre up  sam oh is that thing still alive that grog is fighting around the corner  matt it is  sam okay  travis your turn buddy come on show me what you got  laura keep it from getting away  sam yeah im good at that i will run around the corner  matt as soon as you run around the corner you see this 
none	 mass of fur that is trinket this mass of  muscle that is grog and this tiny little bit of a devilish head of this female as youre holding  your pike  sam do i have more movement no right  matt you do have a little more movement yeah  sam all right can i get up to poke it  matt because it is a reach weapon you can over trinket go ahead and roll an attack  sam would it take my bonus action to say fire and light my weapon on fire  matt yes

none	  laura oh my god dexterity  marisha do you have advantage on that because of my thing  travis yeah i had advantage already but thats cool  marisha okay laughs  matt yeah he doesnt get saving throws he gets skills from you but he has advantage on saving  throws from traps  marisha still cool  travis do i see anything through the doorway from where im standing  matt you step forward make a perception check  travis yeah thisll be good oh hey 18  matt all right as you turn around the corner 
none	 and look in the interior is very lowlit  travis i do have darkvision  matt what little bit of light i know you have darkvision but there is what little bit of  light you see is two sources of very very low deep red light these two giant pools of some  thick red liquid that are just emanating this very very faint glow inside you see there is a  giant chair that is affixed into the center of the chamber as well as an altar in the center  upon this chair you see similar to 
none	 what you battled in the city of brass you see a massive  pit fiend the wings lazily uncurled to each side the corpulent mass of it is just this giant belly  that hangs over the front of its knees it clutches to its side and its using currently to  keep one of its arms propped up is a large axe and the other hand is just resting on the side of  the throne and you see it just sitting there tapping its fingers looking straight at you as  you enter as you step into the 
none	 middle of the hallway  travis ooh its like an invitation  matt there are a series of clusters of bones throughout the entire room  laura oh my lord  taliesin it looks like a happy little robot from up top  travis now that i see him can i look to my left down the rest of the hallway  matt you can and it leads to what looks to be a portcullis gate an iron gate of cross bars that  has is closed currently yeah  taliesin cool cool  travis afucking jenga  laughter
