further ado lets get back into the realm of exandria  taliesin when we last left off we were in a cardboard box  matt yes in hobotown usa  marisha i knew this day would come  matt so last we left off vox machina having traversed many places in the world in hopes of  finding a way to expel or destroy the chroma conclave a collective of four chromatic dragons  that together managed to destroy large bastions of /none/ society on the continent of taldorei and beyond  in wildemount thordak the cinder king the seeming leader of their group currently sits in  the center of the partially destroyed city of emon the other dragons have scattered about and  claimed their own territories from this the party has discovered the existence of these  legendary magical items referred to as the vestiges of divergence that existed from wars  long past they were carried on from generation to generation that contain power that may be  sufficient to defeat these creatures you were sent to seek out /none/ the nameless sphinx that exists  somewhere near the frostweald weeldweld its pronounced so many different ways  sam which is it which is it  matt it can be any of them its a magical world the frostweald  laura oh its right in between it  matt its in that weird place  taliesin frost wilfred brimley  matt frost brimley frost brimley is the most dangerous of forests by the way everyone gets  diabetes sorry somewhere the sphinx exists in the frostweald which the nameless mate to osysa  the gynosphinx you met in vasselheim sent /town/ you to go seek out this information upon going to the  town of westruun to the north it had been partially destroyed by the black dragon umbrasyl  and in its absence had been taken over by what seems to be grogs roving barbarian herd  travis dicks  laura total dicks  matt they currently sit on the throne of the town of westruun and have made some sort of accord with  the dragon where they can both simultaneously rule that area as long as they continually provide  goods gold and whatever they can procure from /none/ those who live within the city still deciding to  continue south the party made their way into the everfrozen forest of the frostweald you stumbled  upon a small hive of basilisks that surrounded an obelisk of ioun which gave you your first clue as  to the location where this sphinx could be found you battled the basilisks destroyed their  underground hive or at least the exit from it via fireballs and other such stone wall endeavors  found amongst the stone ruins of previous victims of the basilisks you found most of tyriok  gadsworth the /none/ wandering cartographer now missing a portion of his right arm however he is  restored and alive which is much better than how he was before and is currently leading you guys  towards a camp of orcs supposedly nearby as some of the survivors of westruuns destruction were  camping far south and some were being captured by this roving orc camp so you guys have just  stepped away from the obelisk and the remains of these basilisks youve slaughtered as tyriok  leads you guys from where he last saw at least where he saw some roving /none/ orcs before he found  himself turned to stone in that previous area as you travel along the cold midday air of this  forest theres no wind its very still and very quiet which is unsettling in a place thats so  out and open in nature your boots are crunching through the snow step after step but youre  still being as careful and as quiet as you can moving along tyriok is shivering in the cold and  one of you manages to pull out one of your extra blankets you have in the bag of holding /none/ to keep him  from going into hypothermia you guys press on for about ten minutes or so and hes trying to look  around and look at the placement of the sun look at different areas that hed seen within the  forest and hes thinking to himself all right so i recognize that mountain spire time  of the day that way is north west follow me and he continues to lead you in that direction  laura and all of that with just a stump  matt yes youre terrible  travis tyriok do you have a /none/ weapon on you  matt the best weapon i have is right here  travis yeah right on your way lad whispers hes going to die first  matt hes trouncing through the snow little bit ahead stopping looking about before you  realize that hes a huge target hes making a lot of noise  marisha didnt we discuss sending him home  laura no he had to show us where the orcs were  travis yeah i said he shouldnt come but no  laura did i cast pass without a trace on us before we headed out /none/  matt you cast it before the battle i dont recall if you cast it afterwards  laura then ill cast it again so that hes incorporated in it and i think we should try to  stealth it  matt okay  travis you going to tell him  laura hey hey wonderbrain  matt yes  laura i think it would be smart if we moved as quietly as possible  matt why thats what i was doing perhaps i should stand in the back then if you guys want  to go loosely that way about 300 /none/ paces to the right of the second stone you see with the large  outcropping that looks like a gorillas face and then continue ill guide you from back here  travis yeah that sounds legit  matt he steps to the back  laura you know keep a distance when you hear no more fighting its probably safe probably  matt okay okay  liam i walk up alongside him and say listen i know youre not used to weaponry but take this  please its a loaner and i take my keen dagger and i stick it in /none/ his hand  laura what no dont i take it back and i give another dagger to him  liam i give him the keen dagger and say hold this its a loner its very sharp be careful  with it all right if you get caught on your own stab thats all you got to do is stab  taliesin stab the other person not yourself  matt his eyes dont leave the blade and he goes okay  laura dont accidentally stab yourself because i think it sucks your life energy out of you  liam that is /dung/ not what that does  laura yes it does it definitely sucks your life  matt make a deception check  liam at a disadvantage since i contradicted her  laura 25  matt make a persuasion check  liam thats another knife i have  travis oh really  liam yes  laura oh  travis thats a giant die  laura its not above 25  liam 15 its 15  matt he goes perhaps this is best suited for someone who knows how to wield such dark powers  laura i think you are so right and /none/ ill take that from you and in exchange i will give you  this wonderful opal dagger that i have on my person  matt oh this is more my speed  laura still very sharp  travis you know what that one does it makes you infertile  liam give me this you fucking hoarder whats the matter with you what are you  travis yeah can you feel it in your little bits rumbling theyre all going to sleep forever  matt perhaps you have a third or fourth dagger i can try  laura what what did /none/ he just tell you i wasnt paying attention  travis look im a man of the truth  laura hes lying he always lies dont pay any attention to him youre safe with that  liam i push him off ten feet away from the group and i pull out the same keen dagger  laura jesus  liam heres a different one this is a normal dagger  matt how about i take no dagger and i stay away from this you guys are starting to be a little  weird and he hands you the secondary dagger and /none/ he puts his one hand up  liam i just dont want what happened to you before to happen again all right you can even put it in  your belt just have it all right its a normal dagger its fine my sister is intimidating  matt to say the least all right  marisha vax just because hes holding a dagger doesnt mean hes going to be successful at using it  liam what  marisha youre wasting your time never mind  liam hold on to it  matt okay as you guys start walking his eyes /none/ dont leave the blade as he takes each step and  whoosh  laura and then as he walks away it poofs back into his fucking belt  liam no it doesnt  travis all right so we head towards the outcropping that looks like a gorillas face  matt okay so ill have you guys all roll a perception check if you could  travis perception check first one  marisha heh natural 19  laura i dont see anything at all  travis ten  laura one  liam 22  marisha 29  taliesin 26  sam /none/ three  laura off to the races  marisha no im sorry 30 30  travis what  marisha i rolled a 19 my perceptions 11  taliesin i think you notice things and have an epiphany at that point  matt as you guys are walking keyleth shoots her arms out in a stop motion and you look off and  you can see past the clump of trees maybe 60 feet ahead of you guys two hulkinglooking humanoids  tromping through the snow dragging something behind them you hear the distant crunch of the  snow and theres /none/ shape but its darker in the area where they are in the distance cant really  make out a form but you figure these are probably orcish in nature based on their gait and their  outline  laura whispers what is it  marisha i look at the group and i go  travis two deer santa claus  laura hello salute running away  sam milking a cow  liam chacha slide  laura use your words keyleth talk  marisha okay okay it looked like there were two orcs and they were carrying a body  laura /none/ are they headed this way  marisha no theyre headed away from us correct away theyre going away  matt eh parallel a little bit away  laura so i cast pass without a trace on us so should we stealth  matt have you guys all roll stealth now  travis still flat grassland or are there some trees  matt well you guys are in the center of the frostweald  so its relatively thick trees relative canopy  taliesin rolling stealth plus ten  marisha thank goodness 22  taliesin 26  sam 15  liam 45 /none/  laura 29 what  travis 26  marisha you got a natural 20  travis 45 holy shit  taliesin you dont know where you are anymore at that point  liam i am onedimensional  matt so what are you guys going to do  laura hes a dot  travis from our previous time in the frostweald we dont recognize any of this terrain  right  matt i mean you recognize the terrain its a large forest  travis no landmarks no lakes  matt not nearby none that youve seen at least if you want /none/ to go look for that you could but  travis are there any paths in front of us or is it just trees and intermittent terrain  matt if there are paths theyre under so much snow and relatively fresh snow thats perpetually  piled on this region theyre not visible at the moment you can occasional hoofprints in the snow  from some wildlife that might live in the vicinity of the forest  travis dont you like this terrain  laura i do  travis well so what should we do  liam were looking for orcs theyre /none/ what were looking for arent they going where we want to go  taliesin lets pace and slowly approach  laura i like it can i search the ground and see if there are a lot of tracks around or is this  like a roaming party  matt from what you can see around you dont see any tracks from them specifically in front of you  from where theyre travelling it appears to just be the two of them right now theyre either  scouts or hunters and the closer you guys as you slowly approach to get /none/ a better view theyre  both dragging what look to be like two boars that were killed are currently being dragged by their  legs over their shoulders leaving a trail of crimson in the snow behind them  laura i think we should take them out before they get back to their group  sam wait what is our overall goal here are we to slay a bunch of orcs or are we to follow them  somewhere  laura were supposed to slay them and stop them from  travis number two and then number one follow them /none/ and then kill the rest  liam we want to get rid of all of them so follow these guys back to the bees nest and we can take  care of the hive  sam okay well lets follow silently  liam why dont i go a little bit ahead you follow behind by about 50 paces and the rest of  the group behind you  laura but what if we kill them now we wont have to fight them  sam then we wont know where the camp is  laura but i can follow tracks  /none/ sam oh can you  marisha there wont be tracks if theyre dead  liam theyre not coming from where theyre from theyre going  sam they were just hunting  laura fine fuck it  sam lets follow them  matt so you guys  travis we follow them  matt okay you dont catch up you follow  travis at a safe distance  matt okay so you guys continue moving forward watching them as they go at a far enough  distance pikes doing her best to walk behind in the snow but its okay shes barely /none/ moving her  upper body to make sure its minimal amount of movement  liam im not far ahead but im ahead im like 30 yards ahead  matt yeah listening out you can hear the occasional laughter too far away to hear any sort  of language not that i think you understand or know the language orcish but eventually they come  over a hill and down and you see it first as you crest over you can see there is a small clearing  in the forest of this area where there are two tents what looks /none/ to be relatively filthstained  tents like theyve been used for an extended period of time covered in dirt and mud and other  things you can see a small pile of skinned bodies to a side of one of the tents  laura whispers oh theyre definitely bad  sam whispers i dont know  matt theres a large stump next to it with a trail of blood that leads up to it you can see there are  two small fires that are set in the center of this area where theyre keeping warm to themselves  and /none/ these bundledup orcs are sitting around the fires drinking you can see some of them have  random silver mugs or cups some have steins some have carved pieces of bark that are used as a  means of drinking you can see outside of these tents what appear to be large barrels or casks of  wine or liquor that have been probably raided from the camp they found outside of the lake you can  see a couple of them are much larger than the other orcs one of them is sitting down by the  fire and /none/ is chuckling with the rest you see to the back of the camp there is one thats taking  javelins and chucking them up in the air and theyre arcing through and every time he chucks  one you hear a scared noise and as soon as you move to the edge of it you look over and there is a  young man whos strung up by his torso from one of the trees and it looks like a few of the orcs are  making target practice theyve already hit him twice theres one thats sticking out of /none/ his  thigh and another one thats embedded itself in his shoulder and little trails of blood streaking  down but he is currently strung up like a piñata and theyre having fun with him you take a moment  as the rest of the group catches up to you on the edge and you can see there are a few other people  being kept inside the tents right now one large orc musters out adorned in thicker armor than the  rest of them he has a band across his head with a big old rough uncut gem /town/ on the front he starts  barking out orders to a few of them one of the larger ones stands up and hes probably a good  foot taller than the other orcs lumbers to the back of the two tents and you can see there are  two bears that are currently chained up to the back he reaches over and grabs one of the skinned  bodies from the side of the tent and throws it to the two bears and they immediately start tearing  it apart and eating it at this point the rest of the /none/ party catches up to you  liam okay so i saw that  matt yes  liam okay but theyre still a ways off right  matt in fact i could probably show you now since you have  sam whoa its a cozy camp  laura oh my god look at that camp  sam theres fire theres bears  laura where are the wine barrels  matt the barrels are right there right there and right there  sam oh theres the guy hanging up in the tree  marisha where where where  can you point out /none/ those barrels one more time  matt there there and there  laura so next to the tents that the prisoners are being kept in  matt yes  sam okay we have options people  matt they havent noticed you  liam how far back are we  matt you are probably back here a good 60 feet outside of the outskirts of the camp they dont  seem to have noticed your approach and this is entirely however you guys want to approach this  liam all right well i turn back to the group  laura what /town/ time of day is it  matt its midafternoon  sam can we rest are we rested yeah we had a night in the wait no we just killed those  matt no you havent rested since the basilisks  sam okay so were down a couple spells or whatever  marisha yeah but im full on hit points is anyone hurt  laura well im a little hurt  matt it was a bump in the road the basilisks  sam yeah okay hey oi so do i create a distraction while you go around back do we go /none/ in  guns blazing whats the plan i can distract  laura i think it would be good to create a distraction we go in save the prisoners and then  take out the camp  sam so a distraction that would get everyone to run towards me and ignore you  laura and then we can stealth down  liam can we go around the sides  marisha flank them  liam flank them ahead of time  scanlan you create a distraction  marisha as theyre running  liam  closer to here  sam sure  liam /none/ you want to get that guy down to the treeline and get the people out  sam sure ill draw them away from the tents  laura okay and then once everyones clear we bring them back and kill them all or what  liam well this may be it for orcs this could be all of them or it could be just a forward camp  so we need to keep one alive  laura and find out  liam and find out if this is the end of it or if theres more  taliesin thats fair  /town/ travis good thinking  laura how do we get all the prisoners out very quickly  taliesin you have knives you could cut your way through the back of the tent  laura scanlan could you potentially put all the people in the door  sam no that is for my recreational use only also takes a minute to cast  marisha well scanlan can create a distraction i can possibly take a few people out with my ranged  spells along the way  laura im saying get the prisoners safe so that nobodys running blindly into the forest /none/  liam ive lost track of all youve done in the past 24 hours could you send everybody through a  tree even back to where their people are  marisha not today  laura what if you spent some time a minute creating your mansion you have a little door  here once youve created a distraction we can all run up and put them in the door and then we  fight and then we get the people out of the mansion  liam yes thats good thats good  sam interesting idea its an interesting idea  /none/ travis i kind of like it  sam i like it too  liam they can go down to the workout room so they dont soil the other chambers  sam its not concentration i mean its concentration for a minute but then after its  cast its okay  matt once its cast its 24 hours that door stays there  travis yeah all your little mr meeseeks will take care of them  sam but we still have to get them out of the camp and into the door unless i make the door in the  camp /none/  taliesin make the door make the door at the back of the camp and that way we can run them out the  back of the tents  laura not near the bears  liam you need to go full burt reynolds out in front of that camp and get the bulk of them  running towards you  sam i cant do both  taliesin make the door first  travis no no hey look im good for a distraction  liam blow your shawm  sam im fine with distractions but i cant go to the back /none/ of the camp and set a door and to the  front of the camp and draw them out  marisha let scanlan handle i almost called him scandal which is still appropriate let scanlan  handle the door i can handle the distraction  laura okay  liam and taliesin all right  laura all right so we sneak around to the back  sam im really good at distractions  marisha you are youre incredibly good at distractions  liam but youre the only one who can make a hefner mansion out of thin air  sam so /none/ im to sneak in and make a door and await further instructions  liam well all go together  laura well make the door far enough away  liam wait keyleth does the distraction as soon as she goes you go so once those guys start  running towards her  sam how far away are we  matt you guys are probably about 60 feet away from the far outside of the campline so around  this ring here just outside of where the table edges are  sam but were talking like 150 feet 200 feet  matt /none/ youre probably closer to about 60 feet away right now you can move for  sam okay well were fine i can make the door from 300 feet away so were fine so i can  make the door right now before we do anything  laura do it make the door  sam except theres going to be a glowing door in their camp  laura make the door behind one of those trees  sam all right okay im going to go ahead and do it  travis yeah fuck it just do it  laura get ready /none/ to do a distraction right fucking now  liam but you know what youre doing right wait lets get in position you and i can do a lot more  hurt to these guys if were closer to the position we have to go  sam all right flank around flank around its going to take me a minute to cast the spell you  have a minute to get into position  matt so who alls flanking around all right so the twins and percy where are you guys going  liam ill take the long way around this /none/ way  matt over here  travis far side  liam yeah  matt okay so  liam with an eye for the shithead whos tormenting that guy in the tree  matt all right are you going with him  laura no im staying on the other side  matt okay percy youre going with vax  taliesin im going to go actually right over here im going to hide over here and im going to  try and get a bead on the guy on the tree  matt okay easy enough you get a bead on him /none/ in the outskirts there  travis pike and i will go with vax  sam oh shes not a good sneaker  travis oh no youre right she should stay put youre right  matt youre going to be right there  laura charge in after the distraction  matt so grog where are you going  travis ill go with vax  matt vax all right so you make your way around keeping your guys existing stealth checks which  were okay  travis yeah i was a 25  liam 45  matt okay  laura oh pike /none/ did come we said pike could stay because shes not stealthy  matt not stealthy okay then she stays there so pikes going to go scanlan youre moving back  where are you going  sam im staying next to keyleth because i can do this from a range  matt where do you guys want to go keyleth for this distraction  marisha wheres scanlan  sam wait dont do the distraction yet i havent set the  matt where do you guys want to set up for the distraction  marisha where did you go scanlan  sam /none/ im right next to you we want to do it  marisha yeah we want to do it towards us  sam we want to distract around here  laura and then run the other direction  marisha yes  matt all right so you guys are set up right about there  marisha no thats where we wanted put us more  sam no he knows were back right now but thats where we will end up  matt youre further back i can only put you so far away from the table edge  marisha no thats good /none/ thats good thats good  matt all right pikes going to stay up with you since you have the bead right now and if worse  comes to worst she can help rush in and try and help at that point all right so whos doing what  sam im going to start casting the door  matt all right  sam and im going to do it back behind camp on the treeline or whatever  matt okay back far this way  sam you know just out of eyeshot of them  matt okay ill put this little /none/ dice on the corner to represent where the door is  laura yeah thats good thats good  liam i turn to grog  travis yeah  liam im moving a little closer just a bit stay there  travis come with you  liam the opposite of that  travis go away from you  liam this is your spot this is your spot and i creep towards the trees a tree closest to me so  i can get closer which is the orc thats

piercing damage the giant creature as the dagger whoosh through the air  doesnt even notice it its looking over where scanlan is and is /none/ grabbing the chains and breaking  them from where the

it as a bonus action to cast hex again cant i  matt correct how long does it last though  taliesin couple hours i believe  matt i will check /none/  taliesin might have been too long  matt its been about an hour or so since that last encounter as you were travelling through the  forest so with hex up to an hour yeah unfortunately  taliesin oh fuck it and its a full days rest its a long rest

i put down the gun and i breathe  matt chuckles all right that ends your turn brings us to keyleth  marisha okay you mentioned that a few were coming over and looking over at the edge of the  pit are there still a few more at the edge of the pit  matt they werent coming and looking at the edge of the pit they all looked over in the direction  of /none/ where scanlan was rolling in around the center theyre all still in place watching this  giant gnome roll in but some of them have looked over at percy whos firing a very loud weapon in  their vicinity  taliesin i figured i would be part of the distraction  marisha sure how far away is that guy from the pit  matt hes about 15 feet  marisha okay heres what i want to do im going to go earth elemental but i want to like do it  like a badass

his shoulder at you with confused look goes to wring the edge of this  giant club its holding to come towards you as you grab both shoulders gives you this look of utter  sheer fear as you lift him up and lob him over the side /none/ into the pit  taliesin that dryad can help kill him now  matt yeah he does not make his save  sam oh no is he going to crush the dryad  marisha hes going to get crushed hes going to crush the dryad  matt 28 points of damage yeah you hear a pained grunt  sam he died  matt you dont know  laura do we also hear a little dryad voice  matt highpitched grunt  laughter  matt as it gets sandwiched  liam pushed it through  matt the dryad was almost out /none/ of the pit climbing her way out heavy landing all right  so keyleth does that end your turn  marisha

nice you pull two arrows out and release them both at once as you duck behind the  tree the guy whos pulled /none/ out this giant greataxe and is now starting to lumber in the direction of  keyleth this giant earth elemental that burst out of the ground both arrows sink in  laura i use my bonus action to hide  matt go ahead and roll stealth again as both arrows sink into the back of the armor piercing  through and embedding themselves a few inches or more into the back of this this creature looks  over its shoulder towards you whatd you roll  laura 36  matt 36 glances back over doesnt seem to have any idea /none/ where the arrows came from but is  grimacing in the pain end your turn all right pike now is going to  laura oh pike  matt as everyones scattered about pike is going to move forward lets see here yeah going to do  what pike would do  travis guiding bolt  matt guiding bolt  laughter  travis yes  liam laura and travis yeah  laura but shes really strong now with the guiding bolt yeah  marisha wwpd what would pike do  matt so pike is going aim it at one of the /none/ guys one of the guys with the javelins that was  throwing at the guy to prevent that from happening guiding bolt on that ranged spell  attack oh yeah thatll hit thats a 15 plus six yeah that hits  liam come on trickfoot  matt all righty thats 4d6 radiant damage to that guy  liam dag yo  travis 4d6  matt 4d6 15 radiant damage  all oh  travis you roll her really well  matt 15 points of radiant damage the next attack against that guy has advantage as hes now a  giant /none/ beacon as the blast streaks forward from her extended hand smashes into the front of this  orc drops the javelin in his hand spins around looking in the direction she came from and you can  now see theres this glow pulsing off the front of his armor thats going to go ahead and end her  turn bringing us down to their turn now this guy is going to try and get back up hes going to  bring down his greataxe onto the chains he was setting up he was going to try and break them  /none/ now hes going to smash it down breaks both of the chains and both of the bears are now free  taliesin hes prone though can he do that  sam he just got up  matt he got up he can still only move three more squares there thats going to finish his turn  this guy here is going to lurch forward in the front of you keyleth and take two swings with  his greataxe towards you that is a 17 to hit  marisha 17 is my natural armor  matt all right so that hits /none/ and then that is an 18 17 and 18 both hit you you take 24 points of  slashing damage as each smash of the greataxe streaks across the front of the stony armor that  you wear breaking off chunks here and there but theres plenty more where that came from as an  earth elemental that ends his turn lets see this guys going to rush up this guys going to  rush up this guy here is going to attempt to climb out he gets partway up starts cresting  over the edge hes not up because /none/ he was knocked prone as he fell so hes over the side percy  you see one orcish arm come up and start to pull itself out the side of the pit this guy here is  going to move up grabbing another javelin this guy is going to pick up his javelin from the  ground move over this way seeing that the earth elemental is being taken care of and theyre both  going to throw javelins at you lets see that is a 24 to hit  taliesin can i do a gloves of missile snaring  /none/ matt yes you can go ahead and roll  laura are those the ones i gave you  taliesin yeah so thats 24 to hit  matt well what does it say on the gloves  taliesin its actually i can reduce damage i cant change whether or not it hit  matt yes exactly so it is eight points of piercing damage  taliesin eight eight points of piercing damage okay so im going to try and catch it and yeah  i reduce the damage to zero and i actually can catch it in midair  matt as /none/ it chucks the javelin you catch it and stop it in midair  taliesin stab it into the ground  matt stab it into the ground as youre thinking how awesome that was the other one rolled a  natural 20  groaning  liam oh look at that smile  matt however still rolled pretty low on the damage thats going to be nine points of piercing  damage for the second one  taliesin can i use it again or no  matt what does it say on the glove its a reaction you only get one reaction /none/ per round so  no you cannot  taliesin what did they roll to hit though  matt that one was a 20 a natural 20  taliesin a natural 20 so it hits no matter what  matt yeah so yeah you take nine points of piercing damage as the other javelin streaks past  you it cuts past the shoulder nothing too bad but didnt quite take away from the moment that  you just got to enjoy  taliesin i took eight points of damage  matt nine points of piercing damage all right that ends that /none/ orcs turn this one the one that  seems more decorated with the gemencrusted headband runs out and starts shouting orders  sam did the two that were on me attack  matt hes going to come forward and begin to attempt to attack your orb as well all three  strike at the orb trying to cut through  sam can i act like theyre hurting me  matt if you want to  sam ugh ah ooh oh  matt make a deception check  sam deception  matt deception yes  sam 27  liam okay sam /none/ im going to need five small pain reactions and five large pain reactions  sam sounds of pain  taliesin can i get some closedmouth ones  sam sounds of pain  taliesin okay now breathier  matt as theyre all striking at this sphere sparks of arcane energy shooting off with each  blade attack against the outside theyre all getting winded you can see sweat dripping off  their brow as theyre not seemingly making an impact however with each pained cry you give  out you see their grins widen and they realize no this is working /none/ and all three of them keep  hacking at it as the one war chief is like yelling in orcish and they keep slamming at the  sides of this in hopes of cutting through it  taliesin cats with a catnip toy  matt this one two javelins there thats good there thats good there i dont think they have  one in there nope so that is going to be the end of their turn now the bears are going to go  the two bears are going to go tromping forward 40 feet 35 40  marisha /none/ remember the love in your heart  matt this ones going to go ahead and run past to there since they cant attack anything this ones  going to keep moving around he uses his movement to get behind there and starts biting at the back  of the ball this one will get over to the earth elemental as it is the biggest and most visible  target all right thats going to go ahead and end their turn scanlan youre up  sam yeah its my turn  travis wait are we at the top of the round /town/  sam no no its bottom of the round im the last guy and then you oh shit do i keep them  here or do i go to work  laura get them out  sam okay im going to very quickly drop the orb and dimension door into one of the tents  matt okay the orb vanishes and with a flick of your wrist a goodbye wave you vanish entirely  from sight which tent do you want to appear in  sam i had wanted to go to not the one that laura was saying the /town/ other one thats the one i was  going to go to because its closer to the door  matt so you appear inside this tent and on the inside you can see there are two people that are  currently within just to mark where the tent is  sam are they human or are they dancer  matt they are human and theyre pretty brutalized one of them you see is this relatively  welldressed nobleman his clothing filthy part of his face is swollen and bruised from what looks  like hes been beaten within an inch /town/ of his life the other one is a woman and you can see one arm  appears to be broken and shes cradling it in her hand and theyre both recoiling and holding to  the back like the corners of the tent and when you appear they both gasp and begin naturally  scrambling away before they realize youre not an orc  sam i say come with me if you want to live and do i have any movement can i try to unbind them  matt yeah you dont have movement you can start to move over /none/ to start unbinding them if you want to  sam okay thats what ill do  matt okay so you go to the rope bonds and start helping them try and release themselves okay  thats the end of scanlans turn grog youre up  travis watching everybody run forward forming this delicious mosh pit right there in the middle  can i go into a frenzied rage can i book ass towards all these bastards and see if i can get  close to this little prick  matt 30 35 40  travis i have 50  matt /none/ 45  cheering  travis im good  matt well say go ahead and make an acrobatics check to try and move between those two guys  travis 20  matt 20 okay you manage to in a rage as youre rushing through yelling theyre all  confused by the moment of the disappearing hamster ball of a gnome look over their shoulder and you  dive into a shoulder roll like a bowling ball slamming into two of them finding your feet on  the other side swing around and the two that you pushed past knocked on their /none/ shoulder didnt  fall off their feet but you manage to push your way through land in place spin around you can  take the rest of your turn if you want  travis can i turn and say all right amateurs time to go pro and i would like to use reckless  attack and with my frenzied rage i take all three attacks at the crystalbearing piece of shit i  cant hit him with my thing  matt right there hes just out of range  travis hes just out of range whoevers the closest except for /none/ the bear  matt okay itll be either one of those two guys  travis oh yeah hell take it  matt all right go for it  travis hell take all of it so i have advantage on these and advantage on attacks  matt id say go for each attack just in case individually just in case you manage to kill one  you can move on to the next  travis so do all the attacks first  matt yeah well no do the first attack  liam attack and damage attack and damage  travis attack /none/ and damage okay 15 for the first one  matt 15 for the first one hits  travis yay oh god nine 18 18 points of damage  matt 18 points of damage all right  travis and theres a constitution  matt does fail its save  travis yay give me your shit okay second one is a 24  matt 24 points of damage  travis no 24 to hit  matt 24 to hit 24 hits  travis yep thats crap nine thats also 18 points of damage on the second one  matt 18 the first /none/ hack cleaves into the side of his shoulders the second one you bring across his  midsection and his whole innards spill out onto the snow crumples into the ground before you  travis and when i kill someone i get an additional attack  matt as a bonus action but youre already using your bonus action as a frenzied rage  travis right thank you  matt yeah so you can do that outside of a frenzied rage if you kill something  travis so this is the last one and theres a bear there right  matt he /none/ also did fail his save on that so you got another bonus to strength  travis hell upgrades all around bitches last one  matt whats your strength at now  travis 24 its a plus three on top of everything else  matt plus three on top of that  travis yeah  matt nice all right what was the attack  travis no its a plus one because we took a short rest right  sam we did  matt when you take a short rest yeah  travis that wipes it right or a long rest wipes /none/ it  matt yeah i believe for craven edge  travis craven edge strength lossgain from this feature lasts until your next short rest  matt short rest yeah  travis so its just plus one  matt but you can say you dont have to take a short rest if you dont want to its up to you  travis i didnt want to im not hit i was fine i was literally untouched  matt yeah if you wanted to keep it you would have been able to walk around aggressively and  maintain it thats fine  /none/ travis yeah aggressively  matt okay  marisha laughs walk around aggressively  travis 27 on the third one  matt 27 hits  travis thats the damage  matt oh thats the damage all right  travis can i use it against the bear  sam ooh  travis or just the person is he the only other one in range  matt well if youre rolling to hit right whoever youre attacking the ac differs so what  was your attack roll on that one  travis it was a 24  matt yeah no that hits the /none/ bear so go for it damage the bear  travis that was the damage was 27  matt 27 points against the bear got you  travis yeah  matt all right so after completely gutting the first guy you turn around and slam the axe into  the hide of the bear up close you can see the bear unlike trinket edges of its shoulders and  parts of its spine you can see bone protruding out in points and juts its different a little  more dangerous than a regular bear youve encountered at the getgo however your /town/ blade  does sink a good four to five inches into its hide cleaving a giant wound in its side it howls  and seems very pissed off but so are you  travis does he have to make a constitution  matt he did make his save at 15  travis son of a bitch  matt that end your turn  travis that does  matt that ends your turn all right back up to the top vax youre up  liam all right im still hidden so im going to move along the side of the tent /none/ behind those  barrels and i want to throw two daggers at the magicusing orc  matt magicusing orc  liam didnt you say one of them was with a circlet  matt oh that one  liam that one  matt oh yeah right there  liam yeah and im going to use my sharpshooter ability to do negative five to the attack roll  plus ten to damage  matt to the

matt 39 is that with the plus ten sharpshooter  liam oh no its not  matt so 49  liam 49  matt 49 points of damage as you dart up along the side of the tent /none/ getting behind the barrels  it sinks right into the back between the shoulder blades of the chief orc of this group you see  his whole body tenses up from the severe amount of pain and he tries to reach at from the back and  spins around looking straight at you  liam hey go fuck yourself i stare him down  matt all right okay ending your turn there percy youre up  taliesin okay im going to grab the javelin really quick im going to walk over to the guy  whos just starting to crawl /none/ out of the pit  marisha yeah yeah yeah  laughter  taliesin im going to look him in the eye javelin goes right in the face  matt roll for an attack  taliesin im using it as a stabbing weapon im not letting go until he drops  matt right no i understand i do not believe the javelin is finesse so this may be a  strengthbased attack let me doublecheck  liam but its already happened  taliesin thats fine it wasnt about the strength  matt so its your strength bonus plus five  taliesin /none/ strength bonus plus five  travis with advantage because hes hanging over a  matt whats your strength modifier  taliesin one  matt so plus six for this roll  taliesin plus six  matt technically you get advantage because hes there technically prone as hes getting up out of the  taliesin six seven eight nine 11  matt 11 your first attack you whiff he ducks out of the way actually pulling down into the pit  and it misses his head and he gets up again and extends a hand to reach out towards your ankle /none/  taliesin throw it away pull out the gun and shoot  laughter  liam what a raiders moment  travis yes totally  marisha yes totally indyed it  taliesin first shot to the face thats still better 17 to hit  matt that hits  taliesin okay thats 15 points of piercing damage  matt as soon as he reaches out for your ankle you pull a pistol out and he looks up at you the  front of his head detonates and he slumps backward falling into the pit silently  marisha silently oh no  taliesin /none/ im going to look up to see if anybody has noticed that this has happened  matt the two guys that were throwing javelins at you have watched this happen they seem  unaffected theyre just really pissed off at you orcs arent theyre used to seeing their friends die  they keep coming at you so these two are like growls  taliesin all right im going to pick one of them and take another shot the one on the left im  going to take a yeah lets do a sharpshooter shot on him  matt your left /none/ okay  taliesin yeah our left  matt okay go for it  sam stage right  taliesin yeah thatll hit 26  matt 26 hits  taliesin thats 17 points of damage  matt

rage  attacks against the bear  matt go for it first attack  travis first one reckless all three reckless the first two normal maybe the third great weapon  master well see 21  matt 21 hits roll damage  travis yes awesome six 11 20 thats 20  matt 20 /none/ with that you take the axe and you swing it in a wide arc across the front of the  bears body as you hit the edge of the bone it splinters at the impact and its shoulderjoint is  knocked out the sword continues and cuts right halfway into its throat and actually manages to  cut through a very main artery and the bear begins to bleed out on the spot onto the ground  travis is that an automatic failed constitution save  matt with the constitution of the bear no it makes it 14  travis /none/ but hes dead right  matt it is dead the bear is no longer of the realm of the living  travis so i killed somebody so i get an extra attack correct  matt you still get its your bonus action  travis oh its the bonus  matt right so unless its only helpful when youre not frenzying  travis beautiful  matt when youre frenzying you get it every turn  travis yeah i get it all the time  matt yeah  travis so can i turn to my right  matt yeah  travis to /none/ the next bloke  matt regular one or the war chief  travis the war chief lets try the war chief  matt sure all right regular attack or great weapon master  travis regular because ive just got two left so well see how regular does  matt go for it  travis 22  matt 22 hits go ahead and roll damage  travis 18  matt 18 makes his constitution save so already still wounded and bleeding from the dagger that  vax left in him earlier you manage to take the blade down sweeping across the /none/ front of its  armor cutting and actually destroying and causing this jagged edge to the front of its armored  breastplate make your next attack  travis the third one lets do great weapon master  matt okay go for it with advantage  travis natural 20  liam orc down orc down  laura yes  matt okay so roll damage  travis 32  matt so you multiply that by two right before the modifier  travis before the modifier it was  matt 2d6 which you rolled what  travis i rolled a 12 or no /none/ it was seven plus five and then my rage modifier  matt right so its seven times two so 14 plus your modifier and your rage  travis wow which is ten now and great weapon master is ten  matt right so thats plus 20 is what youre looking at on top of that  travis yeah  matt so 14 plus 20 34 and then roll 4d6 on top of that brutal critical  laura what  travis ten no 11  laura 12  travis not 11 12  sam 47  matt how do you want /none/ to do this  cheering  matt laughs jesus  travis i would like to stick the hilt of craven edge into the snow and reach forward and grab his  shoulders and pull him onto the point of the sword  matt so you throw the blade down handlefirst it falls a little bit forward you reach forward  and grab the war chief and pull him down onto the blade he looks up at you staring into your face  the entire time as you pull him over each jagged inch of the blade  travis yeah lets /town/ see the light leave those eyes  matt the life expires as it falls forward on the blade let me go ahead and make a constitution  save that is 18 makes it  travis thats it thats my turn  laura that was a good turn  matt but he is done that war chief is done well done that brings us to vax  liam all right im going to curve around to the front of the tent im at and start aiming at the  larger orc whos whacking on keyleth there  matt all right glancing /town/ at the tent by the way you do see there are a few people in there that are  still bound and shaking and trying to look out and see whats happening  liam i see them i note them and im throwing two daggers at the person attacking keyleth the thing  matt all right  liam first one is and im using im going to use luck thats a point straight up in the air  laura yeah  liam fuck okay the first one probably misses 16 and i was using the minus five so the first /none/  one probably misses 11  matt yes that guy right there  liam yeah  matt yeah that misses unfortunately  liam all right second one  matt or it doesnt miss it hits him but it hits the armor plates of his full plate its too or  the plate of the armor its wearing is too strong and the blade cant pierce it  liam second one is a 26  matt that does hit  liam which hits and since hes up against keyleth i get sneak attack damage  matt correct  liam so here /none/ comes the damage counting 25  matt 25 with that the first one hits the armor and streaks off and vanishes into the snow the  guy turns around and looks over and looks at you directly grins shrugging off the earth elemental  to his side grabs his greataxe and begins to move forward in a direction towards you angrily  however as you let loose the second dagger it catches him right in the center of the face  embedding itself between his eyes and one wanders off as the momentum carries it forward three or  four /none/ steps thudding and grinds its face into the ground right before reaching you into the  fire the body catches flame as soon as it lands collapsing into one of the campfires and it begins  to burn  liam sorry sweetheart and i feel the dagger go  matt yep to the side of your blinkback belt all right do you want to stay right there you have  more movement if you want to use it  liam how much left like five or ten  matt three more squares 15 feet  liam im going to walk /none/ up right up next to keyleth in front of the bear one can i go  diagonally  matt through the fire you can if you want to  liam yeah yeah  matt make an acrobatics check go for it  liam 27  matt okay yeah you basically run and leap up over the body of the guy you just killed using  him as a stepping stone and you see ash and embers whoosh out the side as the pressure  pushes him further into the fireplace you leap in the air land next to the one /none/ orc thats attacking  trinket and right next to where keyleth is currently standing as the earth elemental  laura not unlike a raven taking flight  liam arent you far away  taliesin uncannily good crow noises  matt percy youre up that was way too good  taliesin ive been paid good money for that  matt your turn  taliesin i can emote as a bird  marisha whose his  matt percys turn yeah  taliesin my turn look at that is there only one guy standing now

in front of me  matt okay go for it  taliesin thats 29  matt 29 hits  taliesin /none/ all right thats 13 points of damage and he pushes directly away from me ten feet  matt he does into the fire  taliesin yep  matt so it does 13 damage runs back falls onto the body of the other orc thats currently now  engulfed in flames and catches fire himself he takes six points of fire damage on top of that  and is currently in danger of catching fire  taliesin thats good and then lets see the bear is a still a problem isnt he  matt yes  taliesin ill sneak another shot /none/ at the bear  matt go for it  taliesin this is going to be a sharpshooter and a trick shot i cant take both at the same time  can i its one or the other  matt no sharpshooter is your feat trick shot you cant take multiple trick shots but you can  sharpshooter and  taliesin and trick shot im going to sharpshooter and trick shot  matt made a mistake once we learned  taliesin and thats 23  matt 23 hits big bear its not that hard to hit  taliesin not that hard /none/ to hit has to take a constitution saving throw  matt that is 11  taliesin no he has disadvantage on attacks until the end of his next turn  matt headshot  taliesin yep  matt all right so you go ahead and roll damage for that  marisha is this against the bear  taliesin yeah 25 points of damage  matt 25 points of damage you after you fire the one orc stumbling back and catching flames  you turn around and look at the bear fire again it strikes the front of its bony ridge on /none/ its  head where the brow line is shattering part of the bone and causing it to rear back looks very  disoriented its still angry and ready to swipe but it doesnt really know where its standing at  the moment  taliesin im going to burn through my action surge really quickly and reload and take two more  shots two more sharpshooter shots nothing fancy  matt go for it against  taliesin the bear  matt the bear go for it  liam dont be a happy bear be a sad bear  taliesin 23  /none/ matt hits  taliesin thats 20 points of damage  travis holy shit  matt that actually with that shot you aim for the other part of the brow release it and with  that it shatters part of the bears face you hit a part of the bone ridge that causes the front of  the skull to break and you can see part of its face collapses a bit as the bear  in a pile on the ground  laura no  taliesin so i have one last shot  matt you do  taliesin can i /none/ spend a grit to try and shoot the rope thats holding that guy in the tree  matt yeah you have disadvantage if you do  taliesin disadvantage grit or no grit  matt oh oh sorry to use a grit point  taliesin i can actually technically get advantage on the shot  matt i was going to say you could yeah so if you want to do that go for it  taliesin yeah so ill spend a grit point on that  natural 20  travis ah the golden snitch  matt with that you aim take /none/ a moment fire the bullet you catch it in a way where it doesnt  completely cut the rope its one of those rare perfect shots where it takes two of the three  threads that holds the rope together as they untether it causes his body to creaks and it  causes him to begin to sway a little bit as the countersway comes back it snaps and it manages  to catch him to hit the edge of the tree fall into a few branches that break his fall and he  tumbles out  sam ow  /none/ matt only taking one point of damage  taliesin cant even kill a kitten with that  marisha cant even kill a kitten  matt that was a one in a million shot right there  taliesin no it was a one in 20 shot  matt one in 20 for you yeah one in a million for anybody else but youre percival  taliesin im cool  matt okay cool that brings us to keyleth youre up  marisha whos left alive  matt

something never mind and i take out craven edge i walk up to the orc that shes holding /none/  marisha and i put him in a nice little sleeper hold  travis yeah look mate so unless you want to bleed or lose the head thats attached to your  body are there more of you around these parts  matt make an intimidation check  sam i dont think he can understand you grog  travis he speaks fear  sam oh  travis i get advantage on those because i  matt because of craven edge yeah  travis 25  matt the orcs looking at you and while it was putting on a brave face /dung/ as soon as you approach  holding out craven edge your muscles rippling with the arcane strength of the blade that his  fallen friends have imbued you with as each step happens the shadows that drift off the blade begin  to drift up your arm and off your shoulder and from his perspective the whole world goes dark  around you as you take each step and that grimace on the orcs face falls into fightorflight fear  he says no we are the only ones i am the only one  travis have you had any dealings /none/ with the goliaths that are in westruun  matt we dont deal with goliaths spits blood but it can only get with what little bit of strength  it has left only dribbles down the chin in a notveryaggressive way  travis anything else  sam yeah we need to know wait does he know anything else is there another camp is there  anything  taliesin no  sam they just had some prisoners  taliesin yeah  travis yeah is there any reason why i should leave you alive laughs i love this question  matt he goes /dung/ no i should go to whoever made us i will die here with my brethren i will not  run a coward  liam has he seen a cave with a sphinx in it  sam yeah sphinx  travis before i dispatch you to your maker have you seen a sphinx or a cave of magical origin  around these parts  matt rot in kords prison halfgiant  travis and i take craven edge and i grab both of his ankles and i pull them apart and i shove the  blade up under his grundle and then /none/ rip one of his legs off  matt its a horrific display even the earth elemental takes a step back  taliesin cool  matt fails the constitution saving throw  travis yes  laura while that was going on i wanted to run forward and work on the guy that fell from the  tree i wasnt paying attention to that  matt yeah pike has gone over to help and hes pretty messed up but pikes already gotten to him  at this point while this is happening you come over and aid and manage to keep him /none/ from dying  hes unconscious still and he slowly comes to consciousness  laura does he look like the description that we got  matt yeah its cyrus bloodied horribly brutalized but alive whats your strength at now  travis plus four to attack and plus 11 for damage  matt whats your strength score at  travis oh score it is now 21  matt 21 nice fuck dude  laura youre stronger than pike again  travis yeah only for a little bit  matt all righty  marisha are there any other prisoners still tied up  /town/ sam yeah im in the other tent untying them  matt yeah theres three more in this side over here you guys were  sam calming them down looking for loot  travis 20  marisha i was going to say before i drop my earth elemental form i start busting open some of  these crates for quick lootage  matt you should have a higher strength than 20 if you kept it from the last basilisk fight because  youre 17 you got how many bonuses from that combat  travis seven from without the short rest so /none/ its been seven  matt youve got seven bonus benefits  travis yeah  matt so youre 24 then arent you  travis no only 21 because it takes two to go up the thing right  laura no  taliesin oh boy  matt okay so every time they fail a saving throw your strength goes up by one every two  strength you get a bonus  travis oh  matt thats how it works  travis oh im at 24  matt so your strength is 24  marisha laughs thats awesome  matt which means your /none/ overall strength bonus should be plus seven  liam juicing man hes juicing  travis im going to turn that plus four to a plus seven  matt because your strength modifier normally is plus three correct  travis correct  matt at 17 with every even number it goes up and it goes up one point by each time you steal a  strength every two that you every time it hits an even number 18 20 22 24 the modifier goes  up by one so yeah if youre strengths at 24 right now your overall strength modifier /none/ is plus seven  so it would be a plus four on top of whatever your normal attacking damage was already  laura wow  taliesin so your strength saving throw goes up by one  travis so plus four is correct i had plus four down okay got it got it got it got it  matt plus four on top of what you had normally yes  travis on what i had normally  liam lets get this camp cleared and get these people inside scanlans love shack  matt as youre untying them theyre all thank you /none/ thank you so much they took us in the night  we didnt

thats sobbing shes like its okay its okay and is patting him on the shoulder  marisha its always the kids man its always the kids  laura are you survivors of westruun  matt yes we were up by the base and they came in the /none/ night and they killed my wife and they took  me they took everything  laura youre safe now  matt thank you  laura as is your camp  matt thank you  travis if i could ask have you seen fuck wilhand  sam wilhand  travis yeah wilhand yeah  laura small older gnomish fellow  matt the little girl pipes up and goes yeah yeah wilhand he was as tall as me  travis i drop down to my knees you seem very brave do you know where wilhand has gone  matt i havent seen /town/ him since we left town  laura so he stayed in the town  matt i havent seen him outside of it  sam oh the town we were in the camp okay  laura whats your name darling  matt vanessa  laura vanessa youre very strong vanessa  matt thank you youre very strong too  laura oh well thank you do you like bears not those scary ones but really nice ones  matt and you see shes a little bears are a rough subject for her shes probably seen them  eat a few people she /none/ knew  laura trinket sits back hes friendly  travis hes super cuddly and i run over and i put trinket in a headlock and give him a noogie  see totally nice  matt trinket breaks free and licks you right across the face your beard up to the side again  travis here we go again  matt she chuckles  marisha i drop elemental form and start helping pike heal whoever needs healing  matt okay  laura i go for that circlet that was on the war chief  travis oh good call  liam grog /none/  travis yeah  laura i inspect it first  liam we should bury the dead theres piles of dead we should bury them  laura was it human bodies or animal bodies  matt they were human bodies  travis yeah of course youre right  liam well put them in the pit and then well cover it up gimme a hand  travis yeah whatever you need  matt the rest of the people while you guys are doing this have been escorted into the mansion  theyre all in there being cleaned up the servants are tending /none/ to them and i mean theyll  be shat out of there in 24 hours but  sam its fine theyll have a good nights sleep  matt at this point you hear a voice in the distance say hey is everything all right  laura oh quite come on over  matt walking out from behind a tree a onearmed man he comes running over i heard a lot of  craziness going on those you did good saw a little bit of it  sam did you have to use your dagger at all  matt no but /none/ i kept it there just in case and hes still clutching it in his hand  travis theres one standing behind you right now  matt yelps spins around and swings it loses his grip of it and it dagger flying into the  tree and hes like runs over grabs it  travis nobody saw that totally cool  matt okay thank you so you guys begin taking the bodies over and putting them into the pit on  top of the orc that you blew most of the forehead off of  taliesin two orcs what did we /none/ two  marisha two dryads  taliesin two dryads two orcs  laura the circlet  matt well the dryads have vanished by now at this point the magic you inspect the circlet  the circlet is more of adornment looks like it was a symbol of power does not appear to have  anything magical about it but the uncut gem in the center appears to be a raw ruby probably  worth about 150 gold in its current form you also find on their bodies overall from the ones that  you have access to an additional 230 /none/ gold pieces and amongst the goods that have been gathered  here if you should wish to return them or keep them for yourself there is roughly 700 gold  pieces amongst the other bits of dried food startingtorot vegetables  sam theres a couple boars right  matt there are a couple boars that were dragged in that have been killed  taliesin lets eat the food that wont last and return cook the boar and return  matt there is one unspoiled fire  marisha yeah can we take a short rest  taliesin we can also bring /tavern/ the food into the mansion and let the help cook it  sam thats true how about the casks whats in the casks  matt there are four casks of varying size there are two large large casks theres one giant  grain barrel theres one barrel that appears to be of a standard ale and there are two smaller  wine barrels only one of them appears to be labeled or at least hasnt been fully rubbed off  theyre nothing special these are probably grabbed by whoever ran a tavern in westruun and  took what they could /none/ during the chaos  travis all ale and wine is special  matt fair enough  sam we should take that and wait this meat dont we have a cold bag dont we have a cooler  travis we do  sam lets keep some meat  travis that nothing is in  laura no we do have some stuff in it  travis some stuff is in it  sam keep some grain and meat or something  laura all right yeah im keeping some boar meat  marisha but seriously i eat some because im keyleths a little /none/ hungry  laura i thought you were a vegetarian  marisha no never said that  travis can i try and roughly butcher this boar  matt youve done it pretty well you butcher the boar theres already a stump set up for you  previously used for not quite as humane reasons but you manage to prepare the boar cook it over  the area here as the sun slowly begins to set you guys take your short rest is everyone taking  a short rest  travis not me not me  matt okay so you maintain your /none/ damage you still maintain your  sam wait the sun is setting are we taking a short rest or a long rest are we spending the night  liam cant we go in your house  sam of course we can yeah are we going to spend the night what time is it  matt its about five oclock in the afternoon  sam oh little early  liam lets pack it in early who knows whatll happen tomorrow  sam are we going up to the mountain  liam yeah tomorrow morning  sam all right do we need /none/ to scout up how far to the mountaintop  taliesin were not going to the mountaintop  sam or the glowing place  matt where the beacon is keyleth would be the one that knows since shes the one who marked it  its probably about an hour and a halfs travel on foot to get there  sam we should go check it out before we go to bed swing by on a broom or something  laura i like it ill hop on the broom  matt okay  marisha wait check it out and then your door /none/ is stationary though right  matt the door is stationary the door is on the outside of this camp  travis but everybody insides safe  laura yeah  travis do it  laura can i stealth in the air  matt not really  laura can i wrap myself in like my  travis what aluminum foil  matt i mean you will make a stealth check  liam youll figure this broom out eventually  matt im going to put it at disadvantage because you are its possible but youre also a giant  rocketing halfelf in the /none/ sky  laura im not that giant okay  travis wow wow  matt roll disadvantage  laura so i usually get advantage so ill just roll regular  travis i love your broom rolls so much  laura oh oh you know what i still have pass without a trace because i never cast hunters  mark to break that concentration  liam you nerd  travis i would not remember that shit  laura 23  matt 23 all right cool dont forget your point of exhaustion grog from the end of the frenzied rage  travis yes /none/ thank you  sam im going to go with her youre going on the broom yeah im going to turn into a mangy crow  that looks like it would be with a witch  laura i like it cackles  sam ill polymorph  matt polymorph you follow her as a crow  sam and i perch on her shoulder crow sounds  taliesin unnervingly realistic crow noises  sam thank you  matt thats so creepy  taliesin unnervingly realistic crow noises  matt perfect  sam wow thank you  matt so as you continue cresting over /dung/ the top of the tree ridge heading towards the direction that  keyleth points out to you you guys swoop down as the treeline comes to an end the snow begins to  subside and you reach the base of the stormpeak there make a perception check  both of you actually  sam mine sucks natural one  laura im so scared of all my dice right now  matt what you got  laura 17  matt 17 okay  laura oh wait favored terrain  matt mountains  sam youre in the air though  laura forest /none/ at the edge of the mountain  matt does not pertain to the forest more of its the mountain  laura okay 17  matt 17 okay as the sun finally hits the edge of the mountain range and begins to set and the  lights starting to diminish youre having a hard time picking out details you know the general  vicinity that keyleth pointed at you it takes longer than you anticipated but eventually you  come and there are a few small caves and entrances to the side of this mountain but after  you sweep past /none/ once or twice doing a couple loops one catches your eye you look at it from  this vantage point it looks like a small inlet like a cavern as you get closer unlike the other  rough entrances this one seems intentionally carved in the mountainside in a triangle directly  about 30 feet to its peak there is a triangular entrance to the very very base of this mountain  that is recessed into the mountain rock itself  laura i dont think we should land on the ground we should just stay above  sam crow sounds /none/  taliesin realistic crow sounds  laura you cant talk when youre a bird  matt he cannot  laura oh this is really smart you coming because we cant do anything do you want to pop  out of that can you pop back in one caw for yes two caws for no you cant even understand me  right now this is ridiculous  sam i dont know can i understand her  matt you can understand her yeah  sam im just fucking with her then  laughter  matt but she doesnt know if you understand /dung/  laura i float down gracefully on the broom and give it a little bit of a closer look  matt okay as you pull down to the edge of the tunnel the cavern entrance you can see the  relatively worn through time and weathering the structure of the tunnel even though it is  intentional it has been there for a long time and you can see the effect that time has had on  it from what was once a very pristine entrance looking inside it goes dark about 25 feet in do  you want to /none/ step further into the cavern  laura no no no im still in the air im not on the ground  matt okay so yeah looking inside about 25 feet past what little bit of daylight that still exists  disappears into the shadow of the cavern you dont know anything beyond that  laura what do you think scanlan back up a little bit and shoot a flaming arrow into that  sam caws  laura sweet i back up a little far distance away and shoot a flaming arrow into it  matt okay so you pull out /none/ your arrow the shaft ignites as you release it it arcs forward and it  lights up a little bit of the tunnel around it tunnel continues  liam good aim from the broom  matt decent aim  liam okay  matt i mean its not a wide target shes shooting it into an open 30foot space  laura and its not moving its not fucking moving right now  liam ive watched harry potter they always have two hands on the broom  laura why are you trying to do this to me right now why you got /none/ to be a player hater  liam because its fun  matt from the narrative standpoint its fine she could take another shot and it would make it  there anyway you can see it go through and it arcs and then disappears you see what looks like  an edge and it vanishes past it  laura well that looks deep i dont think we should check this out on our own  sam might be fun  laura youre a bird you could probably fly in and fly back out  sam sure caws okay ill fly in /dung/  matt okay you head down coasting into the darkness does your form have  sam i have darkvision i dont know what crows have  matt if you have darkvision but you crows  sam i dont know what a crow has  matt i will look it up real fast  taliesin i dont think a crow has darkvision  matt hold on hold on  travis theyre dark as night man of course they do  sam are they daytime birds theyre daytime birds theyre not owls  taliesin theyre not owls  sam shit  laura /dung/ shouldve been a fucking owl  taliesin owl sounds  sam you can do that too quick do a nightingale  matt no you do not have darkvision as a  sam so im just flying around in the dark knocking into things  matt yeah essentially you coast into the shadow hitting a couple things you eventually  hit ceiling  sam ow  matt and coast down and you land harshly taking three points of damage in your crow form as you  hit and land and tumble down a few stairs  sam ooh stairs  matt /none/ at that point youre in complete darkness right now you can see a faint distant bit of  light thats barely creeping in from the entrance you came from around you though nothing  sam ill break form and come back as scanlan  matt okay you come back as a gnome now your darkvision kicks in and indeed you can see there  is a smoothly carved tunnel overhead that descends down a long flight of stairs make a perception check  sam natural 18  laughter  matt and you have 60foot darkvision as a gnome  sam /none/ it just says darkvision i didnt write down the distance  matt okay im going to look this up real fast because this is important to know for this  circumstance  liam by the way blackbird has a hit point of one so technically you popped back into gnome  form the second you hit the ground  matt does it actually have one hit point  liam yeah  matt then yeah  marisha darkvision is 60 feet i wrote it down  sam 60 feet ill write it down for the future  matt there you go /dung/ so yeah your vision just hits the edge of the staircase which stops and then  continues forward the darkness beyond there is obscured or a hint of blue light that slightly  shifts and glimmers beyond your vision it seems like the tunnel ceiling ends as the path continues  beyond that and your vision is cut off beyond that you cannot see but you do see a very very  faint blue shimmer coming from the tunnel beyond  laura i float up to the edge of the mouth of the cave and say whispers scanlan  matt /none/ echoes scanlan scanlan scanlan  sam wow ive always wanted that to happen  matt echoes happen happen  laura whispers are you alive  sam can i see down the blue thing  matt you can go down further if you want to  sam i dont want to go to where the blue is i just want to see if i can peek down there  matt youd have to descend the stairs to because the actual tunnel continues down along with the  roof and then as it continues past it levels off  sam im going /none/ to die im going to shoot one single magic missile into the space  matt laughs okay  laura what if thats his face  matt all right so you take the wand and the magic missile which gives a very faint  candlelight glow around it as it is a burst of arcane energy arcs down and slams into the  stonework and filters out the little flash you see at the base of the stairway the stonework  there is like a tiled square stonework it looks like the further you descend the more and more  there /dung/ is a constructed architecture to this place however the missile dashes against the stone tile  floor at the bottom of the stairway no other seeming reaction that same blue glimmer  unchanged  sam okay i quickly pee a little on the side of the wall just a little bit okay zip up turn  into an owl and get outta there at level five because im out of level four  matt okay so hooting an owl ascends quickly and spooks you  laura i stay at the mouth of the cave and say whispers scanlan are you /none/ alive  matt echoing alive alive alive  laura whispers scanlan  matt echoing scanlan scanlan  laura wait scanlan is that you you were a crow  sam confused hooting  laura okay thats you should we go  taliesin youre just turning your head 180 degrees back and forth arent you  sam oh yeah  laura we should go back one hoo for i start flying back  matt vex takes off on the broom all right you guys head back to the camp make your way into the  mansion and rest for the evening you /none/ dont rest for the evening  travis no  sam what  laura youre exhausted  travis i have one level of exhaustion im okay  taliesin im going to spend a little time tinkering before i sleep working on the broom  matt okay  liam i never stopped digging can i assume that everybodys buried  matt at this point in time yeah by the time theyve been gone everyones been buried  everyones been taken care of and you make your way back waiting at the door for your sister to return  travis whats the second /none/ level of exhaustion  matt yeah so yeah for not taking your evenings rest you get a second level of exhaustion and your  speed is halved  travis okay i want to see how far this can go i want to push this  taliesin ive tried this experiment in real life it never ends well  laughter  travis im willing to learn  matt okay so well go ahead and take a break as the party is resting for the evening well be  back here in a few minutes guys to continue this next chapter of /none/ vox machinas adventure all  right see you in a little bit  break  matt hey guys welcome back so kicking into high gear to return to the game as its going you  guys go through your restful evening except for grog resting up and getting prepared for whatever  comes your way except for grog as you spend the night fending off sleep staring at craven edge  there on your lap feeling the cold blade against your fingertips and considering and still feeling  the strength that its imbued upon you pulsing through your veins  /none/ travis yeah could i ask it one question  matt yeah yeah  travis right it was a good day right like superb  matt yes  travis do you remember your former owners  matt i do  travis do you remember lord briarwood  matt i do  travis how was he  matt he was a stalwart champion he kept me fed mostly  travis did he give you a goal you know before we put him into different pieces he was like  trying to build up this god called vecna you dont know anything about /none/ a god called vecna do you  matt doesnt interest me  travis no  matt no  travis just the blood  matt just the hunger  travis right the hunger  matt its all there is is the hunger  travis but look we did really good today so im not going to go to sleep im going to carry this  over the next day i want to see how hard we can push this  matt so close to being full  travis youre close to being full hold on how many more lives do you /none/ need  matt im close  travis do you know do you know what happens when you get full like do you get bigger do i get stronger  matt feed me and youll find out  marisha oh boy  travis youve got it can i insight check the sword  matt yeah  liam yes please  laughter  taliesin ive never been so happy  travis clears throat two  laughter  matt its hard to read the blade but the disposition doesnt seem to have changed any of  your previous conversations so seems hard to /dung/ read its a sword  travis outstanding i tell you what if you get full well celebrate this upcoming day  as your birthday  matt if you insist grog strongjaw  travis and thatll do me for the night  matt all right you all come to rallying your breakfast your chickenfilled breakfast  laura and some boar  matt and some boar freshly cooked by grog who has some dark circles under the eyes from a night  of unrestful consciousness  laura how you doing there grog and i slap him across the face a few times /none/  travis really good  laura yeah  travis yeah i slept really hard  laura thats good  travis lots of dreams  taliesin all right lets send our friends on their way and make our way to  the cavern that you found  travis yeah we send them back towards the camp zone right  sam yes and they have a mapmaker with them so theyll find it without a problem  laura theyll know how to get back  matt tyrioks like yes i can actually find our way back quite easily from this position as /none/ weve  already traveled this way and i have a good memory for these types of things i have to  laura yes will you and cyrus inform everyone else that its safe for them oh shit were not  back they cant go there well be back and were going to send you to whitestone where  youll be safe  sam eventually but right now just go to your  taliesin well they were fine rolling around we already sent the wounded and the young to  whitestone theyre fine  laura yeah yeah yeah  matt all /none/ right then that can be done and can i take my satchel with me in case i can find some  way to recover it  laura of course its yours darling  matt all right and he takes the stone armslashsatchel and tucks it under his arm all  right rest of you and cyrus steps forward all right well lead the way and they all give you  guys a thankyou the little girl runs up vanessa and hugs you and hugs keyleth and cyrus  and them pull a couple of the orcish weapons that were left /none/ behind and arm themselves cyrus  actually takes a couple of javelins and is like sighs i think the proper way to make vengeance  with these all right you guys stay safe  laura you too  matt really appreciate it  liam tyriok  matt yes  liam could i have my loaner back please  matt laughs oh right right yeah certainly he pulls it out and hands it to you  liam ill take that carefully thank you  laura you can keep the opal dagger i gave you  matt oh thank you thank you /none/ thank you so much  travis under his breath infertility  matt puts it back away i appreciate that all right so well be off the rest of the people  nod they take some of the supplies from the wagons they begin making their way back on the  already treaded path you guys made that tyriok knows is safe to get out of the frostweald  laura scanlan did you see how generous i was just then  sam nope missed it  laura whats wrong grog  travis what  sam did you have trouble sleeping  /none/ travis yeah no look the sand pit was i think i need to comb it after you use it  sam sand pit i have a bedroom for you  travis what theres a training area downstairs just for me  sam oh grog you have your own bedroom upstairs its got a giantsized bed in it  travis i havent been using it  sam oh for crying i spent minutes thinking about conjuring that  marisha grog you did sleep last night right  travis yep yeah i mean like i had my way with a few of /none/ those imaginary friends because man  no it was good good sleep real a little sore in my back  liam im going to make an insight check on grog  matt insight check go for it  liam yeah 16  matt okay  sam whispers  laura whispers about grog  liam ive never had a whisper before  laura youve never had a whisper  liam on the show  taliesin its warm in your ear  sam i dont know what products were selling currently but i assume there are some  taliesin we do know /none/ that gilmores glorious goods shirts will be shipping out next week  sam oh wow the preorder shirts  taliesin gilmores glorious goods shirt the preorder shirt will be shipping out next week  well be using this time to ignore whats happening over here while the gilmores glorious  goods shirts ship out next week  marisha and of course dont forget to tune in next week for our 50th episode  taliesin 50th episode not anniversary  sam 50th episode theres going to be special giveaways i dont know is that true i dont know  laura what /none/ no theres not  matt so what do you want to do  marisha shall we up the mountain  laura wait so did we already tell everyone what we saw  marisha im assuming you told us when you got back  laura yeah  matt you guys informed the party of what you saw  sam theres a triangle seems to be iounbased  laura blue light  sam smells of urine inside its very weird  liam scanlan maybe not black birds for a while all right its a touchy subject  sam ooh sorry i forgot /none/ well actually no i dont know what youre talking about  liam stay away from black birds for a while  sam okay  liam thanks buddy  sam sure no problem  matt all right you guys make your way southward to the frostweald  sam the frostweald  matt frostweald frostwold  taliesin frostvield what is wrong with frostvield  marisha frostwillem dafoe  sam sigil  matt i will smite you  marisha jif  taliesin jif god damn it you beat me to it  matt all right you guys continue to head south eventually following /none/ the path that you lead along  with keyleths directional  laura i keep an eye out for any enemies along the way  matt indeed you do make a perception check being the scout person for this  laura im going to do that with advantage because im in the woods  matt youre in the forest yeah that is true  laura 25  matt 25 with that you manage to skirt the outside of what appears to be another localized  basilisk nest you catch it early enough and guide the party around it to avoid that /none/ on your way  laura lets go this way and then circle back  matt you eventually make your way to the outskirts of the forest the trees begin to thin  out the snow begins to melt the temperature begins to rise somewhat its still coldish but  its less freezing  travis oh right the frostweald  matt yeah theres been a longterm enchantment over this forest that has kept it the way it is  youre not certain as to what the actual reasons are for it eventually as the sun reaches not  quite zenith but /none/ later morning you find your way to the outside of this tunnel that you and scanlan  had found the evening before there before you you guys see the 30foottall triangular entrance  to this passageway deeper into the mountain itself  laura so this is the place technically scanlan flew in so i dont think he had to check for traps  sam i did not check for traps i just flew in but perhaps we should this time  liam lead me in as far as you went  sam if youll check for traps  liam yeah /none/ where you flew over yeah  sam yes lets do it  liam in the entrance and down those stairs  matt all right so go ahead and make an investigation check  liam 20 no 17  matt 17  sam i will also check for traps  matt okay make an investigation check  sam 22  liam checking for traps i should know this but is that separate from perception for me  matt perception is to notice various details in here if youre actually actively searching for  trap mechanisms like that investigation is generally more /none/ used yeah  sam 22  matt i mean theyre both pretty similar in some ways and it depends on the circumstances  liam but is it a different roll traps or is it just perception and investigation  matt perception and investigation depending on the circumstance one or the other for the most  part perception would be like if you notice something wrong about the room youd be like  that stone seems different then you would do investigation to try to find out what type of trap  it is per se or if you were actively /none/ searching for traps that would be more of an investigation  like knowing where youve seen around and seeing the terrain to possibly facilitate something like that  liam its only my third year doing this  matt i know its all good what did you have again  sam 22  matt 22 all right as you guys slowly descend the steps as you get about 25 30 feet into the  tunnel before it lowers into these stone steps and theyre rather large steps each spread of  your gait is wider than the common step and these /none/ have been around for a very long time you can see  where the corners are theyre rounded looks like at points in time there may have been flooding in  this area that has caused that type of softening of the stonework at the tip though the little bit  of moisture thats in this area seems to be from blownin snow possibly or another source you dont  currently see it is pitchdark in here if anyone would like to  travis i have darkvision  matt he has darkvision darkvision darkvision darkvision darkvision absolutely blind  liam /none/ im pulling out flametongue dagger  marisha then ill light up my hands a little bit  matt okay so you guys have a low candlelight so it gives you a little bit of vision but its  still very very dim you guys make your way down the stairway step to step and you can hear each  footstep echoes as you continue downward it progresses deeper and deeper and you begin to see  this gentle blue flickering light at the very bottom of the staircase as it begins to approach  and your eyes have adjusted to /none/ the darkness at this point in time  laura does it look like water reflection  matt it looks like it could be some sort of waterlike movement and as you hit the bottom of  the stairway and it evens out into these square stone tiles across the way you see ahead of you  what looks to be a singular circular room with no exits from what you can tell at this point just a  circular room that loops around and in the center there is a tenfoot pool of a still somewhat  still surface of /none/ water there is a little bit of movement because there is some sort of a cold  breeze that was ejecting out of the tunnel but there is no real source of the wind that you can  pick up at the moment  laura can i investigate the walls did you already check for traps in this room  liam i did an investigation check  matt as you entered this room  liam yeah ill do it again here  matt that was when you guys were going down the stairway go ahead and make the roll  /none/ liam im going to use luck  sam i got a 24  matt 24 okay  liam 18  matt 18 okay the two of you there is a very very faint blue glow that is emanating from below  the surface of the water that is giving this very very tiny bit of light to the room thankfully  because most of you are darkvisionbased it doesnt impede you from seeing all the details in  the room percy youll still not be able to make out the fine details  taliesin thats why im in the back /none/  matt but between the two of you inspecting the edges there are no seams there are no doors  there are no other passages you do however see script across the opposite side of the room that  is chiseled into the stonework itself in elvish script  marisha oh elvish  matt oh sorry this is not elvish elvish was the obelisk what languages do you  liam common elvish and abyssal  matt what languages do you know  sam gnome and common  matt it is a language neither of you know  taliesin can i /none/ take a look at it  sam you cant see nothing  liam i walk up with my dagger and hold it underneath  matt run it across  taliesin celestial  matt it is celestial  taliesin well there you go  matt are you the only one that knows celestial  taliesin i had not a lot of friends growing up this was a lot of quiet time  matt laughs that is okay all right so looking at this it reads and you read it out  loud the translation the thing about celestial its interesting its /none/ a beautifulsounding  language that even the translation to common is built into rhyme it says knowledge dost billow  all realms are the shore the sky a window the water a door  marisha wait  laura wait start at the beginning  matt knowledge dost billow all realms are the shore the sky a window the water a door  travis yep so in this room its a circle whats the distance across the room  matt its about 30 feet across on a side  travis oh so its not that big  matt and its a /none/ tenfoot pool no its a pretty tight space  travis and theres solid flooring and then the pool in the middle  matt yeah in the middle so you move around so a tenfoot walkway around it  laura can i get on the broom and fly up above the pool of water and look down into it  matt okay go ahead and make a perception check  laura 25  matt 25 looking down into it you see no bottom you see the glow continues downward and its  almost like there is a very soft faint source /none/ of light in there but the water obscures it too much  to see a bottom it doesnt disappear into darkness which leads you to believe that its not  endless but you cant make out any details of where it would end or how far that is from where  you are you do see what looks to be slow shifting movement of aquatic plant life that is  gathered on the edges about ten feet down and further  marisha so percy read this out loud right  taliesin yes i read it out loud  marisha would /none/ keyleth know anything about this as possibly being a portal to the realm of water can  i do like a check to see if this is something that might be a  matt make an intelligence check  marisha not my strong suit  taliesin good oh  laura oh my gosh keyleth youre so smart  marisha im so smart just straight intelligence  matt straight intelligence  marisha 15  matt 15 there is talk of elements here very plainly in the translation its possible  however usually doorways to the planes have a very prominent magical /none/ signature to them one that  is especially you are pretty sensitive to being an ashari and that is a large part of what your  peoples charge is you do not get the feeling that this pool is a gateway to another plane per  se just a very deep pool  laura keyleth use the thing to see magical runes  sam oh yeah yeah the chunk the hunk  marisha okay i pull out my hunk of quall hunk of quall  matt hold it up and concentrate for a moment doesnt seem to spark and there /none/ doesnt appear to  be a reaction  laura really thought it was going to do something i really really did  travis can i take a single gold coin make a wish and flick it into the wishing well  laura i watch it go down  matt drifts from side to side drifts down glimmers occasionally drifts and then is out of sight  liam theres a fairly good chance we need to go down through this grog and keyleth youre  probably the best suited for this you because your fucking chest is so big and you /none/ because you  can turn into water  travis i also have two vials of breathing underwater  laura hey thats a good thing  marisha i also happened to pack control water in my bag of tricks today  travis you did  marisha i did  travis fricking awesome  marisha when we go underground there tends to be water so i tend to bring it  laura should we control it or  marisha keyleth walks up and puts her hands in the pool  matt okay  marisha anything happen when i touch the water  /none/ matt your hand goes in the water it is cold it is in line with most subterranean pools that  youve encountered not freezing but very chilly reacts like any other water that youve  encountered before its not particularly murky either  marisha i dive in  matt keyleth splash you dive in pulling yourself down  liam grog go with her  travis you got it  matt sinking down and you can see the tunnel around you it goes from smoother stone to a  little rougher and as you descend you can see the algae and /none/ various aquatic plant matter and life  that is gathered around until eventually you go down about 40 feet or so your feet hit the  bottom and you can see it ends behind you but then before you there is a tunnel there is a  continued walkway underwater forward  travis i come down behind her  matt you feel the impact as grog lands right behind you let me see here whats your  constitution modifier keyleth  marisha not great two plus two  matt two okay yours is five right for the constitution modifier  /none/ travis oh sorry no im being a dickhole it is five yeah  matt yeah so you can hold your breath for five minutes  sam five minutes  marisha is that however long your  matt yeah one minute per constitution modifier for you its two  marisha interesting  matt after youve landed here youre about 30 seconds in looking around grogs there  marisha how far does the tunnel look  matt make a perception check with disadvantage because of the water distortion  travis can i look everywhere except the tunnel with my darkvision  marisha /none/ bad and bad 16  matt with disadvantage  marisha 16  travis dont worry about it its four  matt laughs its not hard to see the tunnel continues begins to curve upward about 60 to 80  feet ahead of you it is choked with that heavy algae slowly drifting there but there is a path  you can see to swim through where it wouldnt really stop or halt your progress  but it curves upward  marisha you want to keep going  marisha and travis underwater blubbing conversation sounds  matt youre halfway through your /none/ breath by the way youre now at one minute  travis ill swim forward just to where it starts to curve up  matt ill have both you guys make athletics checks  travis that sucks dick  laura at disadvantage  travis at a disadvantage  matt no not athletics  marisha 15  travis 12  matt oh no you do because you have exhaustion  travis oh thats right 12  matt 12 what  marisha 15  matt 15 okay you guys arent having a huge issue you get forward you can move about half  /none/ your movement forward every six seconds or so so you manage to make your way up into the center of  where the plant matter begins to grow darker and more apparent grog you start making your way  through i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity save at disadvantage  marisha what what the why what the why  sam piranhas thats why  matt dexterity at disadvantage because youre swimming underwater in which movement is much  harder as well  liam ninja sharks  travis 11  matt 11 all right  marisha dolphins /none/ with lasers  laura its going to be so bad  matt you take eight points of psychic damage as suddenly out of the greenish plant matter you  see these red tendrils these red vines of algae that begin reaching out towards you one of them  brushes against your shoulder and you feel this surge of shock energy almost travel through your  nervous system to your head and its like you have an instantly pounding headache and you feel  your muscles begin to tense up make a constitution saving throw  laura oh god  travis /none/ thats a one  gasping  matt you feel your muscles lock up as paralysis takes over you watch as grog suddenly tenses up  and the air thats in his lungs escapes in a big heave  marisha upon seeing this i reach forward and i grab hold of him and i cast control water and  jettison the both of us out of there  travis if its water  laura its got to be water  marisha i kicked the camera sorry  matt so do you you push yourself away you jet okay  marisha i /none/ take a jet jetting us back out waterslide  matt so you pull him back using control water to shove you guys yeah the waters basically  pushing you forward like an ice man waterslide and make your way to the other side grog you  thats the first round to get you to the bottom there your constitution modifiers five you have  five rounds before youre officially drowning  travis okay  matt so she pulls you in grabs you to the bottom you look up using control water again to  concentrate this is going to take /none/ you two rounds to get to the top because youre  carrying grogs weight  laura can i see them coming up  matt you do see the form begin keyleths face begin rising to the surface eventually she breaks  through the water carrying grog whos too heavy for her and then dips  right back down in the water  marisha help  taliesin pull grog  matt you grab and pull grog out and onto the edge and hes locked in place eyes wide  marisha can i take the control water to see if i can /none/ like waterbend it out of his lungs if theres  any water in his lungs  matt yeah as you concentrate you pull this single strain of water out of its the weirdest  sensation youve ever had as the water is pumped instantly from inside your lungs  travis its like a reverse beer bong  matt laughs yeah it is and the water scatters across the stonework on the side of the pool it  takes about 30 seconds before your muscles come back and all of a sudden youre  travis coughing and choking  laura what /none/ the hell happened what was down there  marisha really nasty plants and i go over im pretty sure my control water  lasts for a minute yeah  matt control water lasts for up to ten minutes concentration  marisha dope im going to go over and can i start clearing the water out of this tunnel  matt where would you want it to go  marisha out  liam up the stairs behind us is stairs up  matt you cant make water disappear you can part it you can do all kinds of things with it /none/ the  water still has to go somewhere  liam part it an air tunnel for us  marisha thats what i was thinking making like an air tunnel  matt or you can redirect the flow up to you what do you want to do the abilities you have to  choose from are part water redirect flow whirlpool but thats not really  in your realm or flood  marisha and how big was this tunnel  matt all the way across id say its about 25 20 feet across  marisha thats a big tunnel ill part /none/ it  matt okay  marisha yeah  matt so you dive back down when are you starting to part it  marisha i yell to everybody else and i say theres a tunnel through to the other side lets  go and i jump in and ill sink and ill start parting the water behind me  matt all right so  marisha or let me see let me sink to the bottom and then ill part the water in the tunnel  straight ahead  matt okay do you guys follow suit  taliesin i follow  laura /none/ yeah  sam are we diving into water or parted water  matt youre diving into water right now  marisha and before i jump in i say dont touch the plants on the edge  liam so were going through water to get to air  marisha yeah thats what im hoping for yeah  laura is it a fast drop or do we float down with that water  matt you float down because she didnt part the water of the top of the tunnel you guys float  down at a natural pace eventually touching the bottom /none/ of the subterranean tunnel holding your  breath keyleth moves her hands this way and the water in the center of the tunnel actually parts  almost like a bubble in front of you  laura nice  matt you step into that open space now and you can breathe you all catch yourself  marisha lets go fast while i still have this concentration  matt theres still droplets dropping around you as youre holding it at bay and you push it off to  the side elements a lot of the water has been forced out of the /none/ top for the time being wherever  youre going  marisha sure displacement physics  matt yeah however the planet life that was currently drifting freely is all to the ground  and is this giant mass of plant matter on the ground that is soaking wet and there  marisha okay dont touch the plants lets go  laura go where  marisha forward  liam is it covering like a rug all in front of us  matt i mean there is plant matter all over the entire surface its thicker on the edges because  a lot /none/ of it dropped down on itself  liam so are we able to pick our way through  matt yeah it looks like a bunch of wet fur on the sides you guys begin walking whats the  marching order here whos going first  travis ill go first because im at disadvantage on everything so  matt okay grog goes first  liam ill go behind grog  matt okay whos after that  laura ill go next  sam ill take pike and go after her  taliesin ill go behind them  marisha following up their rears /dung/  matt and keyleths following up the rear okay has trinket stepped back into your necklace by  the way  laura yes yes yes  matt okay just making sure  travis hold it up show him  laura hes in my necklace  matt grog as you step past and youre stepping with a squashing sound as your footfalls hit each  of the sections of the dark browngreenish plant matter its really soggy and keyleth as youre  concentrating its a lot of water to part and youre basically creating this 20foot tunnel as  you begin /none/ stepping across you can see the red vines begin to pull their way out but without the  water there they cant support the weight of the vine itself so currently theyre unable to really  shift in your direction you can see them trying you can see the vines slithering in the matted  mass but they cant actually work towards  laura cant move quickly  marisha theyre assholes dont touch them  matt so as you dart across you guys each individually make your way across the other side  of the tunnel where the control water /none/ spell ends you can see the curvature leading upward there is  still that barrier of water thats shimmering right there in front of you you all eventually  make it past that big central patch and as it curves upward you can look about 35 feet at a  diagonal that way you can see the surface of water thats where it breaks  laura oh swim up  marisha can i take the control water and jettison us all up like i did with grog  matt yeah  marisha hold on  matt so you guys all /none/ take a breath as the water wall collapses behind you rushes up and like a  water jet all of you get jettisoned out and have to catch yourself on your feet  marisha threepoint landing  laura i catch myself on the broom and i fly  travis i definitely roll how does scanlan land  sam not well  matt laughs scanlans more like a waterslide he comes out the end and feet in the air its  fun but  sam slipandslide  matt yeah but you hit the sprinkler head you didnt know was under there /none/  groaning  travis the worst  sam theres a rock  travis we all know what youre talking about you havent lived  marisha those things are death traps man theyre the best  laura and when theyre not wet enough  matt so you guys all emerge outside of this pool now you take a moment to look around as there is  no light source in this room either those with darkvision you look around and you see what  appears to be a smooth marble stone floor very intricately carved with four pillars surrounding  the /none/ exit of the pool that you guys came out of you can see on each of these pillars facing  inward or not inward sorry facing outward of these pillars what looks to be these stone lion  heads they each face outward the chamber is also circular but much larger its actually 60 feet  across from the 30 feet of the first chamber you came to  liam right where we are im going to take my flametongue dagger and go in a circle and detect  traps detect some traps  matt okay make an investigation check /none/  liam 18  matt 18 okay as you glance around with the dagger and now that you have light as opposed to  the darkvision that was before you can see now the room is a very deep blue cobalt marble and  the edges of each of these intricately carved pillars where the base hits the rest of the  structure and along the walls you can see what looks like gold and platinum filigree and trim  its a very beautifully very elegantly built room you look around the walls they themselves  are smooth with once /none/ again no door no exit however you look around the outside of the pool  that you came out of and there is a threefootwide gold loop around it almost like  theres a big circular gold plate that surrounds the pool and inside it is carved a language that  you cant understand you recognize it again as celestial  taliesin oh dear  marisha what does it say  taliesin dagger again  matt all right this one translates to betwixt the chaos our order reigns the ones who made us  refined the planes as ages die /none/  marisha hang on the ones who made us  matt refined the planes as ages die their time an ember the four endure the four remember  sam arent there four dragons  travis that cant be what this is about  sam why not  marisha because we killed one of them  laura it could be four sphinxes  taliesin theres four lion heads in the room  matt as you look up as well as you glance at more of the scenery and you put the dagger up  right above where the pool is there /none/ is a beautiful circular mural the size of the room  itself 60 feet across from end to end  laura how high is the ceiling  matt the ceiling is 40 feet tall  liam if its in celestial and it says those who made us i highly doubt that the dragons are the  ones that made the architects of this structure  marisha if you recall there were also five dragons and we killed one of them already  laura yeah its four sphinxes  sam four somethings in the room  matt glancing up across the /dung/ mural this beautifully painted image shows flames twisting  and writhing in an arced pattern that then twist into broken rock and soil and earth and mountains  that then break once again sinking into an angry ocean and that ocean then begins to rise into  clouds into the sky those clouds then dissipating and turning into raw flame  and continuing the loop  marisha its the water cycle  sam elements  matt in the center of this loop there is a single dark hole in the ceiling  laura im flying so im up near it /none/ can i investigate it  matt make an investigation check  liam careful please  laura im not poking my head into it i want to get a closer look  travis thats what she said last time  matt scanlan make an intelligence check  laura investigation or perception you said perception  matt what are you looking for  laura i just want to get a closer look at the circle  matt make it perception ill say sure why not  laura 19  matt okay glancing at the circle i mean it has a similar small /none/ gold band around the outside of  it but this mural is built around this central hole its about three feet across its not very  big and it goes straight up into darkness  laura it said in the previous room the sky is a window does that pertain to this  taliesin it might  marisha it could it said the water a door  laura which we came through  marisha wait and the hole is right above the water correct  matt correct  marisha it lines up it lines up  taliesin vax doublecheck the /none/ gold floor im not  laura are there any runes on the gold around that circle on the ceiling  matt looking around the gold itself no but youre looking at the actual mural itself this  close up there is a texture to the painting itself and you can see embedded within elements  of the actual brushwork and where the flames meet the rock you can see hidden lines with what  appear to be very very faint runes  laura is it the same language that was around the  matt its a language you dont understand /none/ this is not a spoken language  what languages do you know  laura abyssal draconic elvish  matt these are rooted in draconic very ancient this is the basis of what most arcane runes are  created from as draconic is the base root of arcane writing none of them spell anything you  understand with your knowledge of draconic however that is the base root of this writing as  ancient as it is  liam pike does this mean anything to you  sam by the way matt i rolled my second natural one of the night /none/ for my intelligence check  matt okay you have no idea what this is about yeah  sam im trying to get water out of my ear  matt pikes looking up and says this is beyond me this is very old  marisha does this harken back to anything that we remember about the telling of the spark or the  second spark  matt you know im going to make a religion check with her not bad she goes best i can gather  these represent the elemental chaos and the center is the prime our world that /none/ was crafted  out of that chaos when the gods came just like we were told at the platinum sanctuary thats what  you told me you found there  marisha all of the elemental realms overlap which create our realm which is why theres  gateways  travis can i walk over to one of the pillars  matt yeah  travis is it covered with anything  matt theyre all the same and they all have that giant gold stone lion head facing outward from  each of the pillars  travis is there writing or anything fancy /none/ on the pillar  matt make an investigation check  laura i grab the hunk of quall and i float it up to the ceiling  marisha i gave vex the hunk of quall  travis hey 15 with a minus two  matt nothing really catches your attention  travis can i knock on it  matt solid cobalt marble  taliesin the lion heads do they have open mouths or closed mouths  matt the mouths are closed you take the quall  laura i take the hunk up to the ceiling  matt all right what are /none/ you doing with it  laura how did you make this work keyleth  marisha just hold it out like youre searching for a signal  matt okay you hold it up and you see the bauble glows ever so faintly and whenever you drift it  over the mural all the runes that are within a foot of it slightly glow as it passes over them  almost like a blacklight it reveals them ever so faintly  laura does that mean these are magic i cant remember what this thing does  marisha yeah it means that theres /none/ magical essence it finds magic  taliesin im going to take some of the water from the pool and im going to bring it to one of the  columns and dash it on the column and see what happens  matt okay you take the water  taliesin on the yeah the water column  matt you throw it on the column that matches the water overhead you feel this slight grinding  shift of stone  laura wind blows fire burns  taliesin really really we had to bring it there really  matt you glance around and /none/ the lions mouth has opened  marisha good call percy  sam wait what are the other elements fire air  laura yeah i go over to one of the other pillars and blow on it the one under the air part  matt same crumbling sound of stone and the mouth of the lion is now open  travis ooh ooh fire fire  liam i use the flametongue dagger  matt as you brush it across the pillar once again the lion mouth opens on the  outside of the pillar  laura how do we do earth /none/  sam shes an earth elemental or she can do earthy things  marisha well i druidcraft some earth and start wrapping it around the pillar  matt okay you create this little burst of soil this little knob of wet mud and clay and you  circle it smear across the side of the pillar the fourth mouth opens theres a low rumble  suddenly each mouth of the lion begins to pour a constant cavalcade of sand the pool immediately  fills up you guys noticing this room as wide as it is across the way other holes /none/ have opened up  in the side and sand is pouring in  laura oh shit i fly up into the hole in the ceiling  travis oh a fucking hourglass  yelling  laura i fly up into the hole i drop the endless rope down from the hole as im flying it up so  theres a rope in the middle of the room so that everybody can go for im flying up  sam if the sand fills up we can ride the sand up to the hole  matt so you ride up through the top /none/ you go up about 60 feet to the very top before you get  there you have to take a second to go ahead and rummage and find the rope the rope is on you at  all times  laura yeah  matt not in the bag of holding  laura no its on my cloak rope of infinite twine  matt right its a robe its  travis its a robe its not a rope its from the inside of a robe or jacket  matt a pocket on the inside of the robe  laura oh  /none/ matt so you would have to get that from grog first it was probably in the bag of holding  laura fuck all right fine i fly back down gimme gimme gimme the rope  travis i give it  matt okay at this point the sand has now come up to your knees waist area and youre having to  climb out and get on top  liam scanlan grab your horn call out say that osysa sent us  laura i tell him to hold on to one end as i fly up  liam dont you have /none/ a cone  matt the weight of both of you across it especially with your weight the broom pff  laura i let go the rope should be coming out of the robe  matt right okay i thought you were trying to lift him up with you  laura no no no im trying to let the rope out as im flying up  matt okay you pull up and you come off the top again into this chamber that leads into it you  can see with what your vision is a tunnel that leads ahead to a /none/ set of double metal doors  laura is there anything to tie rope off onto  matt no  laura what about the doors are there handles  matt from what you can look over there no they are solid metal  laura shit  liam scanlan can i borrow your horn your cone  sam yes i can yell  matt at this point about half the room is filled now  taliesin okay  liam i grab scanlans horn osysa sent us can you hear us  matt you hear that voice echo up through  marisha gather /none/ close next to me whos close nearby i do a wall of stone as a pillar and  pillar us up towards the hole  matt okay  marisha elevator time  matt it is a threefootwide hole youll be able to fit one person through there  marisha can i at least rise us up to where were close and we can get there  matt okay yeah so  marisha where were up and out  matt so you get up out of the sand now you guys have been climbing up best you can but as the /none/  nature of sand youre still pulling in as its pouring in now you see now parts of the ceiling  are starting to open  laura keyleth do you have the immovable rod  marisha i do have the immovable rod  laura i fly down and i grab the immovable rod  marisha here catch yeah take it  matt okay you grab the rod you fly up you take the rod and you set it in place there  laura tie the rope onto it  matt tie the rope onto it all right at this point /none/ now the sands pushed up you guys are on  the last ten feet before it hits the ceiling  laura climb it climb it  taliesin climbing climbing the rope climbing the rope  marisha im going to go ahead and im going to go and turn into a bird  laura can i fly back down and grab scanlan  sam im okay  laura well i go down and i grab pike then and i go up on the broom  matt okay pike goes thank you  you grab her and she holds onto the edge /none/ of the broom and you guys make it up that way no  since the hole is just small enough where you pretty much have to go through singlefile so  nobody else can climb while youre doing that you guys go through whos coming up first  marisha im flying  matt you fly up after them whos going up first  taliesin ill go up next  matt okay go ahead and make an athletics check  taliesin athletics or acrobatics  matt this would be athletics because youre climbing a rope a tiny  sam the hole /none/ is it triangular  matt no its circular  taliesin 19  matt 19 okay making your way up its a long pull  taliesin im going to batman  matt all right whos up next  liam id like to use acrobatics to ignore the rope and use the sides of this little tunnel to do  that going up  matt okay okay go ahead and do that  liam that is 25  matt 25 okay that keeps you going  so you guys get up a third of the way whos after you  sam i /none/ guess im climbing the rope theres a rope yes climbing that rope  matt yep make an athletics check  sam okay  17  matt 17 okay you guys are all making it up you get about a third of the way up i need the three  of you to make your checks again as it is a very tight space and its a very very heavy pull up  youre just like  liam 25 again  matt 25 again awesome  sam 13  taliesin 23  matt 23 you guys make it up twothirds of /none/ the pathway now you can see now the sand has reached  the bottom and at this point you guys who made it up to the top you look up as you notice part  of the stonework above goes fwsh and sand begins to now fall directly on top of you guys pushing  past you i need you guys to make one more check with disadvantage because of the sand because  that was what the time limit was going to do  marisha its gone its gone  matt as soon as the timer went out that /none/ was when the top one went boom and capped off the top  sam this is an athletics check  matt this is athletics yeah  travis no not 27 24  matt 24 right this is you coming up from the bottom so you make it up a third of the way now  whatd you roll with dis  sam 17  matt 17 with disadvantage  taliesin 13  liam 25 acrobatics  matt 25 you actually have to climb over percy to get past because percys being held up from the  sand that is coming /none/ down grog its starting to catch up to you you i need vax and scanlan you  guys make it to the top and pull your weight out of the sand thats now pouring  down in that tunnel  sam the tunnel on top  matt the top of the tunnel yeah you guys emerge from it and youre now inside a chamber along  with vex and keyleth  marisha so the only people that are left are percy and grog  matt percy and grog  sam pike  matt pike was brought up by vex  /none/ travis second roll was 11 19 total  matt 19 total  liam i have a regular 50foot rope and im tying a loop and im going to throw it down towards grog  and try to get it down so he can hold onto it and help pull while he does what hes doing  marisha can i cantrip a gust against the sand to try and blow some of it  matt its a lot of sand you might be able to help a little bit with your cantrip its more of  a puff of wind than /none/ a strong force and its a lot of sand falling its not going to help  tremendously on this circumstance unfortunately as a cantrip  laura can i use pikes shield and try to direct it to where some of it isnt coming  matt sure go ahead and make a strength check  laura oh maybe pike should do it because shes way stronger than me  matt okay pikes going to step forward  laura shes got 19 strength now  sam dont do this pike dont do this  matt i have to do it  she /none/ steps forward and puts her shield out all right she manages to direct some of the flow  which begins to spray onto the outside of the room begins to fill up one side however that  does give a round of no disadvantage to grog and percy roll again  travis except im exhausted right so i have disadvantage anyway  matt yes you do  taliesin 17  travis 21  matt you manage to make it up the rest of the way the rope percy comes out pull him up onto  the side pike unfortunately its /none/ too much and loses it the sand comes rushing down on top of  you whatd you roll  travis 21  liam i grab grog by the beard and pull  matt hes almost to the top because you made one check thats your second check now need you to  make one more check now as the sands pouring down its now come up to you and its starting to  grab the lower part of your legs and youre starting to feel yourself being buried  liam im pulling on his beard can i cancel his disadvantage /none/  matt the rope that came down roll a perception check grog with disadvantage  what did you roll  travis perception is four but i rolled a 24 on my fourth  matt with disadvantage  travis and laura yeah  matt nice so you dont even see the rope that vax dropped it keeps in the sand but you  grabbing onto the one thats already up there you handoverhand pull up you guys watch as the sand  eventually stops and fills the entirety of the tunnel and stops and then thud slam grog pulls  himself /none/ outside manages to brush the sand off its all in his beard  marisha grog  travis how about a short rest  laughter  travis anyone feel like a nap fucking hell  liam i start shaking out his beard and getting all the crap out  travis yeah thank you  liam and its like fwang  marisha i cantrip gust brush him off  laura i thought we were doing what we were supposed to do down there  sam i think we did do what we were supposed to do  laura jeez it wouldve been /none/ better if we wouldve just gone up the hole  marisha yeah  travis fuck ive never rolled that well in my life  matt that was the time to do it man so you guys now see there is a long stone brick hallway before  you its solid behind you with a little bit of sand thats now coasted from the corner after pike  had diverted it briefly beyond the way about 30 feet ahead of you you see two metallic doors that  are closed  liam traps im looking for traps  matt investigation check /none/  liam yeah thats good that is a 27  matt you take a moment scanning the floor as you approach coming up to the actual doors you take  a minute to look them over they are not locked nor are they trapped  marisha i never trust that thats never been good  liam im going stealth  matt okay  liam 30 for stealth  marisha what did that riddle say something about a name a name must be earned  sam were in a room with two doors is that it  matt correct a hallway /none/ with two doors  laura a name is earned yes  marisha so maybe this is us earning our name  laura or his name  travis wait so we went through water we went through sand  laura now theres fire  marisha and wind  sam we havent gone through fire or wind yet  laura that was really smart grog  liam deathwalkers ward ill have resistance to fire  matt okay that would take a short rest to go ahead and set that  travis im okay with that  liam lets sit and let grog /none/ catch a breath shall we  matt okay you taking a short rest or no up to you  travis yeah ill take it  laura does it cure exhaustion if he takes a short rest  matt no long rest cures exhaustion  travis oh fuck that shit im rolling through  matt laughs all right you guys take a short rest you take a breather here if you need to use  any hit dice now you can all right so finish the short rest youve reset your armor to fire  resistance  marisha is there any /none/ runes or anything around in this room that look like they would indicate  matt in the short rest in the time youve taken while there were no traps in the door you guys  did notice that there is a very very faint symbol in the metal very large so at first it just  seemed like it was part of the doors design but as you step back and rest you glance over at the  door keyleth looking at it from this distance you can see the symbol  taliesin ooh hes got paper  matt like /none/ this this is the symbol of ioun this is the ancient original symbol of ioun this  is what is a relief in each of the doors ever so faintly where only at a distance would you be  able to really see it  sam is it the exact same in both doors  matt yes  sam not a mirror image not one blue one green  matt no it is the exact same  sam okay should we open a door  marisha well do you want to bust out those ioun stones you have  sam /none/ maybe theres a clue in here  marisha you also have your ioun stones  sam yeah but whats that going to do  travis in the walls and in the floors and in the ceiling is it just the same marble and stone are  there any porous openings or  matt make a perception check  laura what was that second line knowledge dost billow  sam all realms are the shore the sky is a window the water a door  travis 16  matt okay looking about the stonework is pretty consistent here its old but /none/ unlike the  weathered entrance a lot of this has not seen the elements since its fairly buried and even at its  seemingly ancient time that its been here it doesnt appear to be worn looks fairly fresh you  dont see any weaknesses you dont see missing stones  travis its stone though right  matt it is stone yes  travis like marble or  matt no actually this is more old classic granite or other deepearth stones that are used  for various forms of construction doesnt have any special properties that you can recognize  /none/ taliesin well if no one else is going to i think itll be funny  liam take 20 paces back  sam and do what  liam and wait for me to open the door and look in  taliesin well why dont i open the door and look in  liam all right im a little better at being invisible but go for it  sam which door  taliesin both of them  matt both doors creak open you look into what appears to be a from what you can see because  there is a very very /none/ faint bit of light emanating from his dagger but beyond that it is  pitch darkness percy is the one who cannot see  travis what do you see percy  taliesin i see a door that i have conquered  laughter  travis that was good  liam it was great do i need to make another stealth check at this point  matt nah it maintains  liam all right so im going to  just stay back theres no point in all of us getting with something and i move 20 feet  ahead of everybody  /none/ matt you move 20 feet ahead you enter the room and you can see this chamber is square in size  but it is divided it seems to be in three halls theres a path to the right a path to the left  and a path ahead of you you cant quite see all the way past the hallway continues to the very  edge of your visual range once you enter the chamber however what you can see is to the right  and left of you parts of the wall have collapsed like theres piles of rubbles /none/ and stone and earth  make a perception check at this point  laura im peeking through the door at this point  matt okay she does as well  liam going to use my second luck today because i rolled a one thats better  perception you said 22  matt looking to the edge of the two pathways you can see there appears to be a little bit of a  shimmer or bit of movement like light silk almost like threads shifting entwined it looks  almost like a large very very faint web that is draped /none/ over one wall on the right and matching on  the left side  liam does it remind me of anything ive seen in my dreams  matt i mean other than the idea of a glimmering thread maybe but it isnt glowing its not  emanating light and its very thin very wispy and there are a few of them that you can see  before the rest of your perspective on the two walls that break it into three passageways  liam i dont hear any eightlegged friends around  matt you dont see any currently at this /none/ position ahead of you in the central chamber  you do see what looks to be a small pit like a divot almost like a cauldron about ten feet  across similar in size and circular structure as the first water pool you guys dove into except  for it comes to a convex end with nothing visible in it theres like stones built around the  outside of it  liam i could be grasping at straws but im getting a bit of an arachnid vibe in here im not  sure theres three passages theres webbing of some /none/ kind to the left and to the right and some  sort of divot or bowl on the ground i think you can all come in quietly  laura i walk up next to him oh yeah i see what youre talking about yeah  marisha upon hearing this keyleth drops to her knees and does a locate creature  do i sense any spiders  matt you actually do not sense any spiders  marisha i think were good on spiders  taliesin this thread is silk isnt it its actual material im not going to touch it  /none/ conscious of the creation of air currents im going to gingerly put on my mask so that my breath  does not move things and examine  matt okay make an investigation check  laura smart while hes doing that i want to use primeval awareness to sense celestials  matt and that is one of the entities that you can check with that okay whatd you roll taliesin  taliesin i rolled a two so my investigation is five which is how old im turning  laughter  matt it is a thread and there are multiple as you /none/ get closer you can see there are many threads  that are partway through this 15 20foot wide hallway on the far right that youve gone to and  inspected this network of threads appear to be attaching at the halfway point and then draped  against the wall what looks like a spiderweb made of this thread all converges in the center thats  the best you can make of it you do not sense any celestials  travis the hells a celestial  matt but do mark off your spell slot for that use  laura thats not /none/ a spell slot its just my oh expend one ranger spell slot i have never ever  done that  matt i assumed you were keeping track of that  laura i have never even looked at that bold  matt well going forward  travis it is in bold print  laura wow i am sorry about that matt  matt thats okay  sam is there any way to cross the room without touching the web  matt yeah essentially its a 15 20foot wide thing the web only starts about partway and  encompasses the side of /none/ it  marisha and is there anything behind the webs just rubble  matt behind the webs the hallway continues and then ends and then continues right its almost  like its a square room that has walls here that split it into three different passages and they  all converge again on the opposite side  laura can we see all the way to the end  matt make a perception check  taliesin its very minigolf  laura 16  matt 16 you notice at the end of the two hallways on the sides beyond the spiderweb in /none/ the  corner there are two small five sixfootwide pools of water similar to the ones you dove into  that are lined with stones and a little bit of gold trim similar to what you guys saw in the  previous room  laura those doorways  matt so you have the rubbles on the side you have the spiderwebs you have the pools at the end  there and you have the empty cauldron in the center piece but you cannot see unless you move  further forward you cannot see beyond where those hallways converge on the /none/ opposite side  travis is it just me or does that one in the middle look like a fire pit  marisha i agree i think this looks like a convergenceoftheelements type of a room  travis we have some boar in the frozen bag  sam you want to start cooking here  marisha i can light a fire in that pit  laura is it far away you can set my arrow on fire and send it down  matt nah its 25 feet from the doors you guys entered in  laura oh just dont want to /none/ walk down there  travis the last time we did that shit went down  laura lets get in the doorway and then if something happens we shut the doors  travis well can we walk over to the cauldron first and see whats above it  laura if you want to walk in  matt vax okay as you walk up make a perception check  liam 23  matt as theyre having this conversation looking about and floating back i know your passive as  well but even midconversation with him as you kept an eye out you /none/ see too that to the front of  each of these walls that bisects the room what you thought was just a wall now as youve had  time to study it in quiet as everybody else has been talking during these experiments scanlan  you probably wouldve noticed this too the wall is the separators actually a giant obelisk on  each side just like the one that you saw in the frostweald on the way in that the basilisks were  around you see theyre much newer theyre not as weathered by the ages and theyre these two /none/  markers with the symbol of ioun carved into them  liam shorthalt come here  sam oi oi yes  liam look at this thing look there and there these are like the  sam its like the one that we saw before  liam yeah do you still have the doohickus  sam of course i have my doohickus  liam do you want us to shove it in the hole  sam you realize that i was born to shove things in holes  liam thats why i called you over man  sam all right so /none/ which one  liam eenie meenie miney mo catch a druid by the toe if she hollers let her go eenie  meenie miney  marisha you know weve always found that very offensive i just want to say that  sam ill choose the right one and ill stick my ioun stone in it  matt okay looking at the base of it you see there is the same triangular symbol there you  place the ioun stone into the recess in the obelisk as you do it glows faintly the obelisk  itself tends to give off the /none/ same teal greenishblue glow the other one also does the  same at which point the darkness across the room is immediately dissipated as two previously unseen  braziers across the way burst into flame lighting the opposite side of the room you can see what  looks to be a series of heavy steps that lead up to a higher platform on the opposite side of the  room you can see two pillars at the edge on the very top of this raised platform  that meet the ceiling  sam well lets go up there and check /none/ it out  laura oh my gosh  travis i like it you want a hand  liam i push scanlan a bit up ahead of me  marisha so this is going over the firepit past the wispy  matt yeah theres all the stuff on the sides and the central room has that pit  laura hold your breath as you pass the wispy wisps i dont trust them  liam get that silver tongue of yours ready all right  sam i dont think anythings going to want to talk to us down here  travis can /none/ we look at the ground for laughs for traps as were walking  any squares that might move  matt make an investigation check  travis yup nine  matt nothing catches your attention  travis no were good  liam would you like me to do that  matt are you guys all moving in the different ways the same way which way are you taking  sam if we go to the right or the left we have to cross these webs or no  matt you can move around the web on that it only covers half /none/ the path you still have about seven  to ten feet of clearance between where the web starts and the wall  laura just open with a brazier at the end  matt mmhmm  sam why dont we each take a direction  marisha yeah ill take the left  laura ill take the middle  taliesin ill take the right  matt okay you guys all quietly move forward stepping through these passages stepping around  you can see like i said the crumbled walls in the far corner you can see the webbing there  there are /none/ the small pools at the far end corners before they converge again into the central  chamber where that giant platform is  taliesin i have my gun in my hand by the way and my mask on  sam wait i could just bamf over to the other side should i just do that  laura maybe you should do that  matt you guys are partway across now are you stopping  marisha no  taliesin im going to continue not disturbing the air as best i can  marisha yeah were moving very slowly not disturbing the /none/ air  matt okay you guys keep walking carefully scanlan are you doing anything  sam yeah ill dimension door to the platform on the other side  matt okay you appear on the opposite side and you look around what you didnt see from the  shadow that was being cast past the braziers to the right of you scanlan you see a large form  that is there as a pile a crumpled pile on the top of this platform what catches your eyes and  you guys see this too as you begin to walk up as /none/ scanlan appears and glances over as you get  closer you can see there is what looks to be a cold blue marble that is right there and you see  it being turned and held by what looks to be a very faintly lit giant paw you can see two eyes  that glance up and glance over at scanlan amongst the shadows the same color as that blue marble  as it glances at scanlan and it is massive in comparison to your tiny gnomish frame the marble  is then tucked deep into what looks like hair /none/ of some kind before it disappears the eyes still  glowing the blue color suddenly the form begins to move as two giant arms impacts and a voice comes  billowing out of this entity i have watched you come the creature now stands on all fours a  good 15 20 feet taller than you scanlan a body similar and lionlike to osysas only thicker and  rippling with muscle beneath the fur the face is masculine and humanlike cheeks adorned with  ceremonial marks head wreathed in a thick mane of redbrown hair two enormous feathered wings  /none/ stretch out from its back with a giant whoosh a whoosh of wind that tends to cause the braziers to  shift in place and it looks at you for a second expectantly then to the rest of the others  sam hello osysa sent us  matt it mounts itself there turns so its facing both you and the rest of you as you all approach  you you seek power glory retribution i know your quarry and i know your goal she has told  me i can show you but all great knowledge should not be given /none/ you must be proven it must be  earned it must be earned and as his voice roars the room echoes and you can see wind begin  to whip all around you  glancing over your shoulder you guys can see now the empty pit in the center of the hall behind you  is now whipping into a whirlwind and what appears to be a small centralized cyclone thats now  rising up meeting the ceiling staying stationary in place arcing there the braziers flame up even  brighter now the flames you can feel the heat even /none/ from your distance at this point you can see  now the sphinx is baring its gleaming white teeth there at the top what is my name  sam fuck  matt roll initiative  marisha we have no fucking clue  laura oh my god  taliesin okay that just happened  laura his name what is his name  taliesin im back baby  marisha the golden snitch lives  matt all righty  marisha i have the worst initiative rolls all the time except for earlier today  matt all righty so initiative roll ooh okay all /none/ righty so 25 to 20  liam 24  taliesin 30  matt laughs damn  laura jeez louise  matt all right  laura any ideas  taliesin very i yes maybe i dont know  matt 20 to 15  laura 19  matt 19  sam 17  matt all right  laura that map is awesome  travis all the elements are there  liam look at the fire laughs  matt oh yeah we got flickering braziers guys  sam whoa thats lit its lit up how did you do that  matt dwarven forge /none/ has cool stuff thank you guys  travis fucking dwarven forge man  matt all right so that brings us to 15 to ten  travis 14  matt grog anyone else  marisha seven  matt oh and pike is actually before grog all right percy youre up first  sam he hasnt attacked us  marisha what is his name percy  sam atreyu  taliesin i hate you im going to pull back to the water pit to my right oh to my left sorry  im going to pull back to that water pit im going /none/ to examine it  matt make an investigation check  taliesin 21  matt 21 as you rush over you look down into the pool the surface itself is disturbed by the wind  thats blowing in this chamber however looking into it below the surface you dont see its  darkness you dont see a continuation you dont see anything behind it  the water doesnt seem natural  taliesin okay im going to scoop some of the water with my mask pull the mask off scoop  water and try and toss it at the flame thats right /none/ next to me thats my move  matt okay you put the mask in and your hand moves into it your hand gets extremely cold  suddenly you dont see it beneath the surface it almost vanishes below the water its really  unsettling you pull it up and the water is there in your mask you throw it and the water it  evaporates and the flames flicker slightly but theys too strong and it doesnt seem to have much  of an effect on the brazier  taliesin fascinating all right thats my move  matt yep thats /none/ your move and your action all right that ends percys turn vax youre up  liam how are we supposed to know your name is it osyso  matt teeth are bared and its sitting there looking at all of you waiting  liam im going to click my boots of haste can i use a bonus action to hide and then hold  any stuff  matt you could yeah you can move and then hold your action to a trigger point if you want to  liam where am i in there  matt youre right here  /none/ liam so im going to hide im going to move backward around the corner and hide  matt around this way  liam yeah  matt okay you can move there go ahead and roll for hide  liam okay 25  matt okay  liam and im going to hold for the moment he attacks any of my friends  matt okay got you all right at the end of your turn the entire the wind thats blowing theres  grains of sand that are picked up into it and you guys feel like theres something out of  /none/ place this whole area like this sudden drift you feel like the air in your lungs gets  butterflies for a second and something even though this place is stationary its almost like  the whole place shifts i need everybody to make a constitution saving throw  liam shit  travis fuck  taliesin damn im back  marisha nice  taliesin 26  sam four  marisha saving throw correct  matt yes constitution saving throw  marisha 23 22  liam 17  travis with disadvantage 13  matt okay while most of you guys manage to /none/ withstand it scanlan and grog and vex the wind  feels like its knocked out of you and like you were suddenly stretched thin and you cant  understand it you glance right now its hard to really tell scanlan lurches forward for a second  grog and vex youre right next to each other you both glance at each other and you can see its  like grogs skin has aged suddenly his around his eyes its grown a little more sunken his  muscles have sagged slightly he looks not ancient by any means but it looks like /none/ hes seen  about another 15 to 20 years of travels  taliesin oh shit  travis what does that mean  sam me too  matt you also have although due to your gnome lineage it has less of an effect and no ones  noticed it at this distance but if anyone gets a quick glance youll see a few grey hairs starting  to sprout on the side of scanlans head  sam i get rid of those  matt all right vex youre up  laura oh do i feel old  matt you feel like /none/ youve been pulled through something but it doesnt have a mighty effect  although grog glancing at vex you can see there is definitely a little bit more of a weathered  look to her crows nests forming deepseated frown lines  laura oh jeez i shout out i run towards the other water portal  matt okay  laura and i shout out pike do you know the names of the four ancient gods is your name four  thats stupid  matt there doesnt seem to be a reaction pike goes no i mean the gods that were /none/ at the  beginning theres  laura yeah  matt there was pelor and melora and i mean theyre the ones who cast away the elements the  chaos that this realm was first i dont know and she seems shes bungled and unable to really  formulate what youre asking  laura i wouldnt have any religion anything to base that off of  matt make a religion check if you want to  laura wow wow two thats four ones in a night  matt wow wow its the reverse percy tonight  laura ive been cursed  /none/ matt you try and think back to the conversation you had with highbearer vord in  the platinum sanctuary and your minds a blank you cant recall any of that conversation  laura i have an advantage on anything having to do with dragons  matt it has nothing to do with dragons  laura well i was just checking  matt this is the creation myth of all of existence however you still have your action if  you want to do something youre by the pool its right to your right and theres  this sphinx now rearing /none/  laura i saw percy dip his hand into the water so i do the same thing to see what it does  matt you what you put your  laura i put my hand in the water  matt you dip your hand in the water the hand once it breaks the surface it vanishes into  darkness below the water you dont even see theres no visual on it  laura does it hurt  matt no it doesnt hurt its cold its very cold  laura pull it back out  matt pull it back out your /none/ hand is wet and it drips and you shake it free  laura can i use a bonus action to try to hide is there anywhere to hide maybe against a wall or  something  matt you move one two three four five six youre not going to be able to get completely out  of sight laughs unless you want to jump in the water  taliesin so theres a whirlwind in the center of the room theres two piles of rocks theres two  vats of water theres two torches and then theres two spiderwebs  matt /none/ correct  taliesin and the spiderwebs are covering the walls  matt yeah all right so that ends vexs turn scanlan youre up  sam i will face the sphinx and say is your name ioun  matt the sphinx is still there growling at you she is beyond me what is my name little  scrumptious one  travis hit him  taliesin do you have your earpiece in by the way  sam sure we all do  taliesin okay good to know  sam i mean im not going to attack this thing if it hasnt attacked /none/ me yet so im going to eee  travis theres spiderwebs theres stones theres fire theres water  taliesin working on it  laura i feel like were so stupid we should know this the four endure the four remember  sam can i hold my attack until a trigger  matt you can if you want to yeah  sam or hold my action until a trigger  matt yeah what do you want to hold it for  sam if he makes a move towards me physically  matt okay  remember you guys who are holding your /none/ action you can interrupt and release at anything  if it doesnt happen be aware of that all right so it now goes to the sphinxs turn  travis okay this should be fun were all standing around with our thumbs up our asses  liam yup  matt the sphinx takes a step forward to the edge of the stairway and roars gives out this  earthshattering roar that shakes a couple of stones and dust that are loosened from the ceiling  falls down i need everybody to make a wisdom saving throw  sam is this magic /none/  matt yes it is  liam is it charm by any chance  matt its not a spell it is a magical effect  sam do i get advantage on that  matt what do you get advantage from  sam advantage versus magic on saves  matt from being a gnome  sam it says gnome cunning advantage on wisdom character intelligence magic saves thats what  i wrote down anyway  matt let me doublecheck here just to be sure  sam it doesnt really matter i rolled shit on both so its okay dont bother  /none/ matt laughs okay against magic so yeah you would have advantage  liam and does it have anything to do with charm or sleep  matt nope  liam nope okay 17  matt 17  sam seven  taliesin 19  marisha 23  laura 24  travis 11 disadvantage  taliesin laughs you picked the wrong day to stop sniffing glue  travis what the fuck laughs i know paint chips  taliesin you made a bad call  travis i made a bad call  matt grog vex what was it you rolled again  laura 24 /none/  matt 24 and you rolled  liam 17  matt 17 thats right all right so as the roar pierces through the hallway most of you guys  steel yourself grog scanlan pike and vax you feel the sudden reality of how fearful and  dangerous this creature is you stepped into the lair of an ancient powerful entity and you feel  like your very life is at stake you guys are frightened for one minute  sam okay  matt frightened means you have disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while you can see  it /none/ and you cannot willingly move closer to the creature so you have to either move adjacent  like same distance from it or away you can make a saving throw every turn to try and resist it it  is now going to stay right where it is that brings it to pikes turn pike doesnt quite know  how to deal with this whole circumstance she is going to cast  taliesin text ashley  travis theres also the obelisks we got to go start touching the other shit  laura obelisks were in elvish  marisha issylra is /none/ a continent right  travis it was all written in what in  matt pike is going to reach forward to you grog take a step this way pikes going to reach  forward and cast freedom of movement on you at fourth level  travis oh i was going to rage and shake it but  matt so for the next hour you cannot be paralyzed or restrained you cant have your speed  reduced via magical effects youre still feared but  travis i can shake that with a rage  matt you can shake that with a /none/ rage yes but yeah for the next hour  its not concentration either  travis thank you pike  matt she says go get him grog  travis you got it buddy  matt all right that ends pikes turn grog youre up  travis i might as well do what pike says im going to bumrush the sphinx  matt straightup  travis yup  matt all right you rush up the stairs  taliesin oh god  matt with a precariousness of well say you rush up here for the sake of positioning  travis sure two strikes /none/ straightup  sam just going to hit it  travis laughs yeah im not smart this is all i do 23  matt 23 that hits  travis his face is awful should i roll damage or roll both attacks first  matt its all against him roll attacks youre not going to kill it in one hit  travis no thats true  sam what if its a ninepoint hit point  travis 24 on the first one  matt 24 damage all righty  travis second attack holy shit thats a 28  matt nice that hits  /none/ travis somethings going to happen to me and its going to be bad six 11 23  matt okay makes its first constitution saving throw fails its second so you steal another  strength point and the sphinxs strength goes down to that  travis so im at 25 now  laura down to 79 strength  matt youre at 25 now okay  travis and i dont go up again until 26 right on the evens  matt right but 25 is the max for this sword it says on the weapon it should be under ability  travis /none/ oh youre right yeah  matt all right so you run up and swing two heavy swings after going into a rage to resist the  fear effect you grin and bear it go over and swing twice hacking into the side of it its hide  is very strong and theres almost like this weird resistance on the outside of its body like its  very force of existence and personality is keeping the blade from doing as much damage as it should  but you still strike true slamming into it twice you pull the strength from it /none/ as you do a voice  in your head goes yesss  taliesin oh my god  matt at this point as you look at the blade the blade now begins to emanate a shadow aura stronger  than previously that begins to also form around your upper shoulders drifting the blade suddenly  extends another foot the edges of it that were smooth project with a jagged thorny outside the  blade itself now is longer thicker and far more dangerouslooking than it was before until your  next short rest all attacks with the sword do an additional /none/ 2d6 necrotic damage  all whoa  travis laughs super saiyan motherfucker 2d6 necrotic damage okay and ill stay there  matt okay  travis and await my punishment  matt all right at the end of your turn the sphinx is going to use its  three legendary actions  liam three legendary actions  matt is going to use three of them to cast a spell out of order its going to go ahead and  call down a flame strike  laura were all going to die  matt onto the twins  laura why  liam /none/ can i attack him now while hes casting because i held my turn  matt you can actually yes  liam okay so im hidden and grogs next to him which would normally put me at advantage but hes  got me afraid which puts me at disadvantage which means it cancels out and its one straight  roll right on the attacks  matt correct  liam okay good so im going to throw im hasted im going to throw two daggers at him the  first one is probably hits wheres the freaking page 23 for the first /none/  matt 23 hits  liam 18 for the second  matt okay  liam do they both hit or just the first im only doing two  matt what was the second one it was  liam 18  matt 18 hits  liam okay so the first one is seven the second is seven and i want to use the rest of my turn  to as im hasted to run around to the back of that obelisk and start reading  matt over here  liam yeah  matt okay all right as youre doing that reaction /none/ shot it calls down the column hits both  of you before you can burst off all of a sudden as you look over at your brother you feel this  rising energy before all of a sudden this entire area is boom consumed in burning holy divine  light i need both of you guys to make a dexterity saving throw  liam im going to use evasion  matt yeah evasion happens automatically as part of your reaction to that so yeah  liam okay  laura 30  liam dexterity so 14  matt you rolled a /none/ what  laura 30  matt 30 dexterity saving throw  liam no eff it im going to use my last luck of the day ugh barely any better 16  matt 16 for you  liam mmhmm  matt okay right so vex you take half damage from this you take full damage unfortunately so  thats going to be 21 points of fire and radiant damage to you  travis is half  matt 21 is the half you however have resistance to fire liam  liam yes  matt so the 22 points of fire damage you /none/ wouldve taken is reduced to 11  liam with evasion if i fail i take half damage  matt right so yeah so you would take so you would take the same but a quarter because of  halving fire damage to take from that  liam so i didnt hear the number because i was reading what was  travis 21 so half 21 would be 11  matt well radiant damage youre not resistant to so id say it would be 17 points of damage there you  go you rush out of the flames and find your /none/ way around the obelisk however you have to wait  until your turn before you can take a look at that all right now it comes to keyleths turn  marisha okay i yell out issylra  matt it doesnt seem to have any effect  marisha okay that might be a continent  matt it is  laughter  matt its the continent where vasselheim is and  marisha not his name and i cast control water again and i start pouring the water out of the  pools and onto the fire  matt okay the water comes /none/ out as a column doesnt appear to be coming to an end youre not  quite sure where its being drawn from its this constant stream and as it hits the flame tshhh  but the flames arent going out its all turning to steam and its filling the room with steam and  the more and more it pours into it the more and more the room is beginning to become obscured and  making it hard to see  marisha okay well i stop that  matt okay as you do the streams stop water the pools are /none/ still completely still where youve  pulled it out of seemingly unbothered other than the little bit of wind thats blowing and have  not lessened in their volume at all  marisha good to know can i do some sort of check to see if i wouldve heard anything about this  type of a thing in my druid time is this like a different plane of existence what is this shit  matt what this place you are  marisha yeah or would i know of what his name would be from the telling of the second spark /none/ and  any of my elemental knowledge as a druid  matt make an intelligence check  marisha ooh thats good 19  matt 19 thinking back about the stories youve heard which isnt a whole lot necessarily are we  good on the stream  ryan offcamera yeah were good on the stream  liam had a little flicker  matt we had a little flicker you recall go through poring through all the information that  was given to you you dont know a whole lot about the history element it isnt a part of the  druidic /none/ training experience but based on the discussion with highbearer vord no mention of a  sphinx nothing like that  marisha fuck i dont know you guys  matt i think thats your turn though unless you want to move  marisha no im good  matt okay end of your turn the shimmering webs on each side flash for a second and stepping out  of them you can see a slightly translucent not fully physical spider on each side  liam fey spiders you son of a oh god i keep hitting that we got to fix that /none/  matt this spider immediately skittering up to percy and this one skittering up to vex  laura ah cmon  matt versus you percy rolled a one completely missed it goes and reaches out towards you out  of the way vex however that is a 23  laura that hits me  matt that hits you go ahead and suffer  laura you go ahead and suffer  matt laughs suffer nine points of psychic damage the spider upon biting you dissipates  out of existence it actually bites you and then its form shhk into your head /none/ and causes this  psychic backlash and feedback in your head the other spider misses you and remains in existence  top of the round percy youre up  sam oh well if at the end of the round have i not gone yet  matt you have not gone yet do you want to  sam can i go  matt yeah  sam yeah i mean i guess ill attack at this point  matt okay  sam ill try something that will definitely fail i will try and fail to put him into the resilient  sphere /none/ which im sure will fail laughs  matt what is the dc on the resilient sphere  sam well i dont have my stuff with me  matt i believe if its through the  sam through the hand cone  matt the hand cone i think is 20 now isnt it  sam its 20 now yeah  matt okay so it doesnt make its dexterity saving throw  sam but i have disadvantage on attack but that doesnt matter  matt doesnt matter for this one that is 21 yep  sam okay  matt so you attempt /none/ to create the sphere around it as you can see it begins to encase the sphinx  and the sphinx just its head after staring at grog goes growls and as it roars at you the  sphere thats formed around it shatters and the arcane essence is scattered  about the room and vanishes  sam can i ask him if his name is earned  matt he sits there glaring at you  sam okay thats a stupid question sorry  travis maybe say it in celestial  sam i dont know celestial  laura say it in /none/ celestial percy  matt all right so thats percys turn now percy what are you doing  taliesin the first thing im going to is im going to guess a name because thats fun  matt sure  taliesin im going to yell lux whatever that would be in celestial first light  matt okay you shout out and the sound of celestial being spoken has this echo to it this  lux and it fades afterward it has no immediate effect the wind seems to swallow it around you  from all the noise going around the sphinx has /none/ no interest  taliesin thats fine im going to take a slash at that spider with my sword  matt go for it  taliesin thats 19  matt 19 hits  taliesin i dont suppose that theres a keyword dragon in there anywhere  matt a what  taliesin i dont suppose theres a keyword dragon anywhere in that spiders description but  matt laughs no there isnt  taliesin pissing in the wind  matt its okay it is a magical sword youre attacking with right  taliesin it is a magical sword im attacking with thats 11 /none/ points of slashing damage  matt this spider is scattered into ether  taliesin with my sword out im going to run

the water thing i assume  marisha i can im close by im close by i can handle it  matt at the end of your turn the water thats around you its freezing cold and you suffer  eight points of cold damage /none/  laura okay  matt from the process of submerging into it however once that damage hits your body heat  manages to recover and it turns back to normal water temperature so  sam im going to i will attempt to cast eyebite on the sphinx  matt okay the dc is 20 on that  sam yeah  matt what is the saving throw for that one  sam wisdom  matt wisdom eyebite it is that is a 27 yeah it resists the

and thats how much it reduces it by  sam by eight  matt by eight that brings it to a 17 whats your ac  sam 16  matt so it still hits you hits you for 28 points of slashing damage as its giant claw whoosh  rakes across you the sheer impact almost throws you off the top of the platform and you can feel  the blood beginning to seep from the wound under your armor it turns around and rapidly does a  fullon claw attack towards you grog that is going to /none/ be a 27 to hit  travis oh yeah  matt you also take 28 points of damage it is magical damage however you dont doesnt  matter for you being its a resistance against slashing so you take 14 points of slashing damage from the  strike thats going to end its turn that brings us to percy  taliesin whos that  marisha thats ashley  taliesin

stones until eventually you find sand /none/ just like the sand that you encountered in the  previous room  taliesin okay im going to take a handful im going to grab a bunch of that and  matt okay you

shits happening so grog after seeing this though you cannot say to anyone what /none/ you found  yet you having no tether are drifting away from the portal and seeing it disappearing slowly away  from you what are you going to do  travis can i grab my earring and say what i see  matt you grab your earring you say it theres no response you guys hear nothing  sam hes gone  matt and youre about 15 feet away from it now  laura grog  travis can i take my chain of returning and attach it to craven edge and throw it through the  doorway that i see /none/  matt you can go ahead and roll for an attack  laura what if it hits pike  taliesin shouldve had a breakfast  travis 23  matt 23 whoosh you fling it through and it catches something you feel its taut you start  pulling your way in pulling your way in pulling your way in go ahead and roll damage  laura and marisha its pike  taliesin oh  sam god its fine  marisha its got to be pike  travis damage oh damage sorry damage i rolled the wrong thing  please dont let /none/ it be pike nine  laura pike  travis 14  laura plus 2d6 necrotic  matt yep plus 2d6 necrotic damage  travis 30  matt 30 30 points of damage okay you pull the chain and you make your way to the portal you put  your hands out pull through and as you do the chain in your hand you look and you can see now  grasping onto the edge of the wall you see pike sweat dripping down her face as craven edge has  embedded itself into her abdomen shes holding it and she /none/ looks at you with a gritted face and  she goes its okay grog youre back thats all that matters  laura thats the saddest thing ever  travis i crawl through the door can i run to pike thats my turn  sam did you get any of his name  matt doesnt have a chance yet at the end of this turn it uses the last two points of its legendary  actions to teleport  sam im going to counterspell that  matt okay  sam dont know why  liam keep it away from pike and /none/ grog  taliesin its always the right move  liam yeah instinct buddy  matt all right so now we get to go ahead and roll for this i believe let me go ahead and  check what level it is i believe its a all right this is a 7thlevel spell  sam jesus i mean i wrote down crazy things but it says at level four roll plus five versus ten  plus level i dont even know what that means  matt here hold on so dc equals ten plus level so its dc 17  sam /none/ okay so i have to roll  matt using an ability check roll d20 and add five trying to beat a 17  sam ability check at disadvantage  matt yes  sam yeah thats not going to happen  liam yes it is come on  sam well that wouldve worked the first one was an 11 plus five  matt 16 one under you go to counterspell but the image of its head and seeing pike wounded  its too much for you and your hand shakes and you cant manage to clarify the dispel magic as the /none/  whole sphinx vanishes and appears right next to pike all right that brings us to vax  liam can i try to make my wisdom save before i do anything or does that come at the end  matt at the end of your turn  liam all right then im going to come around the corner  matt its not in your sight by the way you dont see it  liam i know can i walk over yeah ten feet that way and see it scowling down at pike  matt you can yeah around the edge /none/  liam and put three daggers in its flank  matt go for it  liam first one misses its a 13 24 and a 15  matt all right 13 24 15  liam yeah  matt middle one hits  liam eight eight points of damage im going to try to shake off the fear  matt eight points it does get sneak attack because its adjacent to pike  liam but am i at disadvantage because of the fear i thought i was at disadvantage  matt oh youre at disadvantage to all the attacks yeah wait /none/ im sorry i thought those  were your three attacks  liam i did three attack rolls but i thought that to get sneak attack damage i need advantage but  if im afraid i dont have advantage  matt right but pikes still adjacent thats one of the ways you can get sneak attack is either  having advantage or an allys adjacent  liam all right i thought that meant that sorry all right ill take it four seven 13 25  added to what i said before which was eight so 33  matt 33 so one /none/ dagger two of them you throw and they vanish into the cyclone consumed and  thankfully return with magic or they would be gone for good third one you throw it stabs into the  shank of the sphinx who growls turns back to pike all right is that your turn  liam i dont know what i rolled so im going to roll again 20  matt 20 you manage to finally shake off the fear all right  liam can i use the rest of my movement  matt you can yes  liam im going to run /none/ up to the side of the sphinx  matt youre there all righty now produces two spiders jump out of the web both of them the  only thing they see rush up to vex that is a natural 20 and a two laughs so the second one  misses you first one you take 16 points of psychic damage and that one vanishes on the  impact all right that ends their turn up to the top vex its your turn  laura grog what did you see  travis can i respond  matt i would say make /none/ a wisdom saving throw at the sight of what youve done to pike and all that  is happening this is to see if you can shake from the stupor of what has happened  travis nine  matt hes not responsive right now  laura i guess i jesus can i bring trinket out thats stupid if i well im going to go and try  to see whats going on over there with the sphinx  matt okay so you rush over right there  laura can i see grog  matt you can you can see grog /none/ as you rush around the corner you can see the sphinx there  you see pike with craven edge partially embedded in her abdomen the chain now lax as grog is  standing on the outside of the portal holding it in his hand his eyes wide the rage has faded  now by the way  travis yeah  laura can i run forward and cast cure wounds on pike  sam shes pike  laura shes got a fucking sword in her can i help her  matt yeah you could cast cure wounds if you want  /none/ laura i mean does she still have a sword through her can i pull her off of it and then cast it  matt sword is still inside of her right now yeah  liam dont do damage to yourself  matt you can try and pull it out if you want to make a strength check roll a d20 add your  strength modifier  laura i know i oh natural 20  matt and for the one who normally cant find the physical strength of activities like this through  the inspiration of seeing  laura it reminds /none/ me of what happened to pike before  matt yeah and that clear image crystallizes in your mind of when that glabrezu snatched her from  you once and with that you find the strength to persevere you reach out and grabbing the jagged  blade take nine points of necrotic damage in touching the outside of the blade but you pull  you can see the blood forming at the edge of your fingers as you yank it outside of pikes body and  it clatters to the ground at the base of grogs feet grogs still seeing this /none/ all before you  eyes wide open mouth agape  laura grog snap out of it and i cast cure wounds on pikes stomach  matt okay what level  laura level three  matt level three so 3d8 plus i think its whats your modifier for wisdom  laura three  matt so 3d8 plus three and that will end vexs turn scanlan youre up  sam can i roll to see if im fearful  matt thatll be the end of your turn  sam okay then im going to as a bonus action cast healing words on /none/ myself  laura 17  matt 17 okay good to know  sam ill heal myself at level two 2d4 plus five okay seven points great and then for my  action ill dimension door into the tornado  matt okay you dimension door into the cyclone you find yourself on the outside of the wind  before it grabs you and pulls you in you step through a portal and youre now drifting out in an  expanse of air and cloud theres no up theres no down theres no left or right you see various  masses of /none/ land slowly rotating in place as you see different gusts of wind floating about you drift  by and see a single stone that has carvings on it  sam dammit  taliesin you did this to yourself  sam great  matt however you have no anchor and you are drifting away from the opening you came through  sam thats my action and my bonus i have no movement  matt correct so you were  sam im gonna just do this  matt okay you do that theres its air youre still drifting away all right that /none/ brings us to  the top of the initiative round lets see for this one i need everyone in the room to go ahead  and make another constitution saving throw  travis so ready for a nap 24  matt 24 vex whatd you get  laura six  liam seven  matt keyleth  marisha do i use my fire elemental constitution 14  taliesin 18  matt 18 okay pike makes it  laura so hard to get these last two fucking letters  matt okay so you rolled a 14  marisha 14  matt all /none/ right so keyleth vax and vex all three of you guys suddenly feel the wind pulled  out from you once again and you all age and now im giving you the specifics here youre  aging each time this happens ten years all three of you bones are starting to ache a little bit  not terribly but a little more than usual your bodys now starting to feel the wear of time  passage  travis if thats happened twice theyre 20 years older  matt yeah 25 for those who got hit before  sam wait the /none/ first time was 25 years  matt the first one was 15 now its an additional ten to those who were hit  laura the first one was 15  matt yes  laura wow but as a halfelf you have a longer life so really at age 50 youre not that far in  matt its not huge its not like a major difference you know 25 years to a human to  percy would be a lot harsher than it is to you guys its minor differences it is now the  sphinxs turn the sphinx is now /none/ going to roars roar even louder this time this roar echoes out  with a shockwave i need everybody except for scanlan to make another wisdom saving throw  marisha fuck me  travis ten  matt ten and you were still frightened from previously right because you did not shake that  travis yeah i never shook it still in a rage but never shook it  laura but your rage ended  matt you dropped the rage all right pike all right  laura natural 20  liam 11  marisha 24  taliesin 19  matt all /none/ right so vax suddenly as the blast hits the fear hits you again as the sound  vanishes and you cant hear  liam mup  matt theres nothing you are completely deafened  travis deafened  matt as are you and pike however because you were previously frightened you find your muscles  tense up and you are both paralyzed as well you cannot move you cannot speak you cannot  liam and im not afraid but im deaf  matt you are afraid and deaf yeah all right percy its your turn  travis weve both seen it /none/ we cant say shit  sam well im floating to my death so  taliesin bugger all i got to fix this shit oh what a clusterfuck  sam dont worry i still have my lips blows whistle  laughter  taliesin great okay where is can you point to vex in that  travis wait didnt i have freedom of movement  matt this is vex here you do have freedom of movement so you are not currently affected by  paralysis look at you remembering your buffs buddy so the fear still hits you and your  muscles /none/ tense but you looking over at pike now frozen in place you remember everything thats  transpired and that holy divine energy that she imbued upon you glows from the inside and your  muscles return to you and youre still able to function  travis oh pike  matt percy youre up  taliesin im going to turn around the corner  matt around here  taliesin grog say the bloody words  matt make another wisdom saving throw  marisha come on grog snap out of it  travis nine at a disadvantage  taliesin okay all right /none/ all right all right what the fuck am i going to do i am going to hold  my turn right here  matt okay holding your action  taliesin until such time as someone says the fucking letters that we need and im going to be  ready to yell them out  matt all right keyleth actually at the end of percys turn the sphinx is going to go ahead  its going to use one of its actions to do a claw attack now against this is going to be against  pike that is going to /none/ be a 15 which misses the claw even though shes paralyzed actually no  he has advantage on the attack because shes paralyzed rolled a one on the second one manages  to hit her but the armor and the shield takes the brunt of it not dealing any physical damage to  it theres now frustration in the sphinxs voice as its growling with each one of these screams  now it is your turn keyleth  marisha okay question as a fire elemental i can fly right  matt does it say on the fire elemental it should /none/ say movement flight  marisha it says that i can oh movement it doesnt really say it says i can move through a  space as narrow as one inch wide without squeezing  matt well for the elemental form here which i have a list of your elemental forms just in case fire  elemental speed of 50 feet no it cannot fly it moves as a flame across the ground  marisha cant fly so if i go into that portal im going to be in the same fucking situation im  assuming  taliesin sadly there is /none/ only one of us who can fly and very busy right now  marisha okay im going to drop my elemental form  matt okay  marisha you still have my immovable rod  laura its planted next to the water  matt its over there  laura but my rope is attached to it and its dangling next to me i dropped it when i healed  pike so its right next to me i pulled the robe over to there  matt yeah the robe that produces the rope is on the ground right now next to vex /none/  marisha okay before i drop elemental form im going to go pick up the rod  matt what are you doing  marisha its so i can move faster pick up the rod  matt 15 20 25 30 35 40 and then you drop your form to grab the rope  marisha drop my form  matt and youre grabbing the what the rod  marisha the immovable rod  matt all right so you click the rod off you now have the rod with the rope on the end of it  marisha and do i still /none/ have movement now as myself  matt no you in dropping the form youve used most of id say you have one more square of  movement left  marisha ill step forward a square  matt this way or this way  marisha no the other way yeah yeah and say vex catch  matt okay so you throw the immovable rod to her  marisha yeah  matt make a dexterity check easy enough for you  laura 19  matt yeah you catch the rod no issue  laura i know it was really close  matt /none/ all right so is that your turn  marisha i think so i think thats all i can do  matt all right that ends keyleths turn at the end of keyleths turn its going to use another  legendary action this one its going to go ahead and reach out and strike at you vex as youre  now holding the rod  laura of course  matt thats going to be a 29 to hit you suffer 28 points of slashing damage as its giant claw  rakes across the front of your body almost tossing you off /none/ your feet from the sheer force of  the blow  laura 28 points  matt 28 points that brings us to grog  travis i look down at pike pike buddy are you all right  matt youve gotten your senses back now at this point you look at her and shes still frozen in  place she cant move and you can see the sweats still pouring from her face the wound has stopped  bleeding the wound is still fresh and visible  travis and i call out the letters inside the wind are ori  marisha /none/ ori  laura maljikaori maljikairi  liam karimaljika  laura kaorimal  marisha malkaoriji  matt anyway anyway before you guys start doing this whole thing take your turns to do stuff  grog what

it thats all i do  matt okay ending grogs turn it is pikes turn pike cannot move fails /none/ the saving throw  unfortunately is still paralyzed still frightened  taliesin i was holding my action for this  matt okay what are you going to do  taliesin maljikaori  matt no response  marisha hang on wait before you move it before you move it put it back put it back put it  back okay i want to write it

up this is  taliesin malkaoriji  matt nope that is your turn however in the six seconds you shout out you come up with and shout  out those three things that ends percys turn at the end of percys turn its going to use its  third legendary action to go ahead and make another strike at vex holding the rod 25 to hit  laura yeah  matt takes another claw and rakes you for 28 points of slashing damage  laura im unconscious  matt vex falls unconscious on the ground /none/ from the blow the rod clacks to the ground behind her  that ends that turn all right oh shit i did that out of order its fine thats my fault  percy shouldnt have got that turn but well say it happened its fine vax youre up  liam im going to use my bonus action to disengage from the sphinx and im going to run  around the whirlwind and as i move im taking the rope which i already made a loop on and im going  to throw the loop over grogs head on one end /none/ and im going to jump into the whirlwind holding  tightly im going to into there im going after scanlan  matt the rope clenches onto your neck and you feel like youre being choked suddenly without  even realizing this as you shout this out all of a sudden a lasso is thrown around your neck and  pulls back and cuts off your air supply  travis chokes okay  matt and you vanish into the cyclone the rope goes taut pulling you come through the portal  and you can see indeed scanlans about 30 feet away /none/ and drifting  liam and i was hasted and i ran at the whirlwind  matt right which is why youre gaining on him but its still going to take a moment as youre  both still drifting because he also leapt through  liam its really quiet in here but then again it would be really quiet out of here as well  matt yep all right so thats going to be the end of your turn vax this spider now is going to  leap over as two more or sorry three more leap out of this they /none/ all rush up to keyleth shes  the one visible person there and all making strikes against you that is 19 to hit  marisha hits  matt eight  marisha miss  matt 23  marisha hits  matt and ten  marisha miss  matt all right so you take 12 points of psychic damage as two of the spiders dissipate leaving  nothing but a psychic mist behind all right top of the turn vex i need you to make a death  saving throw  laura six  matt six mark off one of your failed /none/ death saving throws scanlan your turn youre floating  out in space and you see all of a sudden through the portal vax come rocketing towards you hand  forward clutching a rope in one hand arm outstretched towards you what do you want to do  sam well as much as i appreciate the gesture im going to try to dimension door out of here  liam i deftly roll my eyes so fucking hard  matt you dimension door and you appear right at the doorway you cannot dimension door through  dimensions but you make your way /none/ to the outside of the door you are still drifting with the  momentum you had going backwards so you appear back at the door and start going backwards again  sam can i grab the door  matt you can grab the rope  liam i dont see or hear him so i assume he is healing my sister right now and i feel  comforted  matt you see him vanish theres the rope there that vax is carrying you can grab onto that and  wrestle through with that scanlan manages to pull himself through the portal /none/ landing onto the  side right there and youre fine now thats probably going to take your full action  everything to get there but youre out  sam bonus too  matt ill give you a bonus sure because your movement  sam all right do i have time to assess and see that shes dead  matt shes doing pretty rough yeah  sam i will heal her  matt all right healing word  sam healing word at level  matt what level are you doing  sam i dont have many levels at level three  /none/ matt okay so thats 3d4 plus five  sam i roll  matt yes 3d4 plus five finishing up scanlans turn  sam 11  laura hey its better than zero thank you im alive  matt all right i need everybody in the room to roll another constitution saving throw  laura laughs oh no  matt except for you youre not in the room  laura this aging thing is it permanent forever  sam well find out later  marisha maybe if we ask nicely hell make us young again  liam i probably look really good /none/ with ten years on me  travis 16  laura nine  liam im not here  matt oh sorry keyleth  marisha 17  matt pike succeeds 17  taliesin 24  sam 21  matt 21 all right so  sam do i also have to roll for fear  matt at the end of your turn you would yes actually no i think thats gone off of you now  its fine so vex you come to consciousness and you age another four years  liam aw he softballed you with that one  matt i rolled /none/ a four its a d20 every time yeah  marisha shit  taliesin you basically just got netflix thats really all that happened  matt it is now the sphinxs turn  travis were all laughing and one of us is unconscious  laura were seriously going to die  taliesin were not going to die were doing great  marisha were doing all right  matt there next to scanlan and percy two claw attacks against you that is a 28 and 21  taliesin im going to use my shield to glance off  the 21 im going /none/ to use the shield of plus five ac  matt okay which reduces it to a  taliesin versus ac of 23 it gives me a temporary ac of 23  matt right so the second one would miss so the first strike hits you for 28 points of slashing  damage the second one scrapes across the arcane barrier that appears before you from the brooch  and resist that thats the end of its turn percy you got your turn last turn when you  shouldnt have but im letting that fly  taliesin no because i was /none/ holding my  matt oh sorry you were holding it yes  taliesin its all part of the plan  matt i confused myself so yeah now its your turn  taliesin i said jamalkaori last time if i recall  matt you did  taliesin kaorijimal  matt nothing  taliesin all right im going to while im saying all these things im going to be running  around the corner back towards the spiderweb make another one  matt what have you said so far  taliesin we said maljikaori  marisha maorikaji  taliesin jimalkaori  marisha /none/ and kaorijimal  matt right okay so you have two more if you wanted to do anything taliesin  marisha you should try that one  taliesin is that as far as i can move right now  matt you can move up to there i think  taliesin okay i cant get any closer to the web  matt not for your full movement unfortunately  taliesin kamaljiori  matt at this point all of a sudden the braziers flicker out you notice as the wind cyclone begins  to slowly drift to a minor wind curl at this /none/ point in time grog if you wanted to pull on that  rope it would be a good time  travis yeah i turn around and grab the thing thats strangling my neck like a dog leash and i  yank it in real hard  matt with that you as youre drifting off you turn around and see the doorway where the rope  goes taut and the door begins to close  liam bye guys  matt youre pulling yourself in and suddenly youre yanked through and come shooting out of it  on the side with that /none/  liam i cant hear you  matt the angry demeanor of the sphinx has entirely shifted and now it goes from like this  low feral position to a proud honored beast putting its paws forward its shoulders high  you have earned a name  liam what did you say  sam oh yeah theyre deaf  matt it raises a paw like this at which point all the paralysis fades all the fear fades all  the effects fade  marisha are we young again  matt the age is not dispersed  sam ever  matt /none/ hold on a second let me see what it can do actually no it goes forward and looks at you  whos looking the worst for wear comparatively and says i can help but one of you and his paw  goes out and touches you theres a warm glow and the age vanishes from you however that is the  extent of my magic this day perhaps the little one could help a few at this it is but a rather  challenging restoration pike nods i can do that i can do that  laura i look at /none/ vax and laugh at him because hes so much older than i am  marisha thats true oh my god you guys are never going to experience this ever again  matt i apologize for the formalities but it is a pleasure to meet you vox machina  taliesin hello  marisha hi  laura you too  sam what was his name again  matt kamaljiori  liam hahaha good one that was a good one hazing who doesnt love hazing right  marisha at about that time i lift up my shoulder and i show him the slayers /none/ take symbol  matt he gives a nod  sam dont we get something out of this  matt looks to you and says i admire your impatience the vestiges that you seek some have  been destroyed over this epoch others lie scattered across the planes some are sealed or  hidden others have found an owner you carry one now i see the sphinx backs up and turns around  on the steps and lays down crossing its paws glancing at you all shoulders high and a smile  its warm its this interesting contrast to when you /none/ first entered well i happen to carry a  vestige here if you will take it  sam i mean sure if youre getting rid of it anyway  taliesin it is most gracious of you  matt gets up and turns around to the back of the platform takes the marble from beneath its fur  and holds it up to one of the doorways which switches  sam what  liam dwarven forge  laura secret doors  matt it pulls something from within shing and you see this single thin blade that vibrates as he  pulls /none/ it out the door closes it puts the marble away the blade goes into its teeth and it steps  back down the stairs takes the blade from its hand as it stops and holds it out its  impossibly small in its hand it looks very dinky here i keep the mythcarver  marisha mythcarver  matt granted to me by the white duke himself before his passing we were friends long ago it  is yours he takes the blade and sets it down on the stone  but you seek the others that remain yes  sam /none/ yes yes  taliesin very much so  matt fenthras the wrath of the feywarden a bow that felled titans it was lost in the feywild in  the calamity  liam obviously for scanlan  laura obviously  matt it now acts as the heart of a cancerous tree corrupting the verdant land there the plate of  the dawnmartyr beacon of protection to the chosen of pelor gathers dust on a wall in the city of  brass a trophy won by a fire giant in a card game from a suutan bloodline that once donned it  /none/ marisha what was that called again  matt dont worry i wrote all these down for you guys  laura oh thank you i know im like theres going to be a test later  matt i know i got this for you guys cabals ruin a magicdevouring cloak once used by an  assassin to eliminate the unscrupulous den of druja it is now worn by a merchantwarrior with a  missing eye in the walls of ankharel the spire of conflux a staff born from meloras very  breath was devoured along with its previous owner by a /dung/ goristro named yenk in the endless  maze of the abyss  sam lets go there  matt the titanstone knuckles were taken from the brutalized corpse of their proud owner now worn  by a terrible halfgiant turned tyrant in westruun i sense you know this tall one i can  taste your fear from here whisper blade forged from metal pulled from the far realm was a center  to many a dark ritual it now lies at the bottom of the ozmit sea sunken with the lost ship the  shrew in a storm 300 years ago /none/ near an island of glass  know that all life is connected on an impossibly small level beyond the minds ability to  understand on your level ideas transcend distance language many share dreams thoughts  inspirations without knowing the fact that you are now aware of these others too may now be  drawn to the search as well beware now go you have earned the name you have earned the knowledge  the race is on  and with that sand begins to erupt from the two piles of rubble swirling in a giant whirlwind of  blasted /none/ stone and sand you guys have to cover your eyes as it begins to completely consume the  vision around you you see the sphinx back up towards the top of the platform before the sand  consumes even within 15 feet ten feet five feet of your vision you lose sight of your friends  around you and for a second the panic hits you before the sand comes to a stop and drops to the  ground looking around you stand at the base of the triangular cavern entrance by the mountain  range where you first entered /none/ the temple and thats where well end tonights game  travis fucking shit  laura that got so much more intense than i ever thought it was going to  travis i thought it was going to be like a gentle education like a gentle

us out right matt  matt yes actually in which case i will give this to you as you now have access to its  /none/ capabilities  marisha fenthras is that what it was no  matt no the mythcarver its a legendary longsword this incredible silvered blade once  belonged to the white duke himself and many more master bards before him it resonates with nearby  musical tones it acts as a plus three longsword and the weapon deals an additional 1d6 force  damage upon a hit whenever you use your bardic inspiration feature you gain advantage on attacks  with this weapon until the end of your turn  travis advantage on attacks  matt so if you were to give /none/ somebody use your bonus action before your attack you would get  advantage on any attacks with the weapon  liam percy that was made for you  taliesin i know obviously im so excited  matt and whenever you use your cutting words feature against an enemy the target also has  disadvantage on its next saving throw  laura wow  travis holy
