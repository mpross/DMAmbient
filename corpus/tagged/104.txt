to tonights episode of critical role  tv static click /none/  groovy critical role theme  matt welcome back last we left off the mighty nein had been following a story thread they had  encountered some pieces of paper that alluded to a mystical orb that they had previously encountered  that seemed to be related to something about your patron fjord after unknowingly having a vision  and absorbing this orb within yourself you completed your business up in the empire and  following information in this note you made your way south outside of the dwendalian empire to the  menagerie coast to the city of nicodranas /none/ which was home and is home to jester  marisha freudian slip  matt yeah bought some pets along the way lost some pets along the way but you met the ruby of  the sea you aided her in absolving herself of the stress of having a really unfortunately  aggressive admirer who was becoming a serious problem so you told him to stop by cutting off  his hand and sending him away forever  sam yeah and killing all of his friends  matt then you went to inquire the docks at night looking for an individual /none/ named marius lepual  marisha its bad when you say it like that  travis the recap really sticks it in and turns it  matt you stealthed you way there began to formulate a plan to listen in unfortunately due  to a not quite as quiet attempt at entering the water garnished their attention a not quite  effective attempt at deceiving them triggered them to realize that they were being followed and  proceeded to try and cover their tracks and take out those who would be following them that led to  a scuffle in the /none/ battlefield of the docks here in the wharf where you alerted the guards managed to  take down these shadowy figures captured marius lepual and hijacked their ship called the mist  where you managed to leave the docks out into the night air the moonlit open night you had just  managed to take down a few figures that remained on the ship a few things were burned in the  process the chaos was palpable caduceus managed to swim out to you guys in time to make it onto  the ship and where we left off you /none/ all had taken a moment and some of you began to head back into  the ship to see what lied within mighty nein what would you like to do  liam well you know all told i think that went very well it couldve been worse they attacked  us unprovoked i know that we were not exactly normalseeming to them but we did not get  threatening with them they made the first move and it just unraveled from there what can you do  sometimes you just have to follow the cabbages in front of you  /none/ marisha what  travis yeah im at the helm is there anybody down below seeing about that  matt jester i think was rushing down  laura i was on my way down right when i stuck an axe in the back of a guys head  liam what did you say  marisha thats right  laura i accidentally stuck an axe in the back of a guys head i didnt mean to though i was  aiming for his shoulder  marisha you can speak with dead though right is that something you can do  laura i /none/ can do that  marisha maybe thats how we interrogate him  laura i dont know if i have it prepared though  sam we could sleep on it  matt whos heading down  travis yeah i was going to say im at the helm beau if youll stay with me we need to  laura i do have it prepared  travis we need to check the ship for damages because we tried to blow it up a couple of times  and then if the rest want to head down and see whats below  sam ill /none/ come with  matt jester and nott who else  liam i will go down as well  matt okay and caleb caduceus youre staying up yashas  taliesin i am going to just sit at the front of the ship wet and im not in any of this right  travis any chance you want to come up and help me i pull a big piece of splintered wood out of  my forehead throw it over to the side in time im good  marisha ill help you out  travis thanks  matt yasha steps over to /none/ you caduceus and she puts a hand to your shoulder and she goes  glad youre okay  taliesin you keep leaving  matt you keep finding me or they do  taliesin i think you might have the right idea  sam whispering oh no  taliesin yeah im just going to sit  matt yasha stands up looks back towards you guys goes over and takes a rope and begins  helping you guys hold onto the sails watching you and figuring out what to do none of you have ever  really run a boat before  /none/ marisha yashas following me im like you can follow me but im just  matt well shes just helping you out with whatever you need on the ship  travis ill bark out make sure the sails are open tighten all the everything off and then  check the exterior of the ship if you can just for breaks in the wood fire marks any damage that  you can see  matt okay make an investigation check  marisha 15  matt okay glancing over the side where the fireball had impacted a lot of the wood is  /none/ charred black there is visible sign of burning nothing is on fire but there was a flashburn  some of the wood right around the edge of the deck is broken and splintered in a bit and part of  the sail underneath was burned and singed not enough to the point where it tore it away from the  mast but there is visible damage but nothing that impedes your movement just more aesthetic damage  marisha it just looks more dope now  travis more dope  marisha yeah we look like badasses i think it makes the /none/ ship look cooler  travis nice  marisha yeah we look rad  travis less fancy will actually do us some good in these waters so thats good  marisha yeah  matt you guys head down jester as youre the first person down the first thing you notice is  at the bottom of the steps you see the fellow with the axe stuck in him and hes on his stomach  and slowly crawling forward  laura hes not dead  sam heal him  laura im out of spells  sam take the axe out of him /none/  liam is it better to pull it out or leave it in place  laura is it like a puncture wound can i cast  sam ill ask him would you like us to leave the axe in or take it out  matt he looks over his shoulder you see the blood streaks down the side of his face and  groaning begins to crawl quicker away from you  laura no no no i hold onto his ankles  matt groaning his fingernails are scraping against the wood floor  laura i know its really terrible im /none/ sorry that i did this i hope youre okay  sam cant you do healing or anything  laura i mean i can cast spare the dying but hes already not  sam spared  laura yeah dying  matt thats when he passes out  laura i cast spare the dying  matt okay hes just like ugh  liam were just going to leave hole in his head like phineas gage  laura well i think you know maybe deuce could do something about it  sam do you want me to go get deuce  laura yeah /none/ see if hell come down here for a moment  sam all right ill run up there and get him  liam im just going to move the axe head a centimeter or two  laura dont move the axe what if his brain starts leaking out dont do it  sam if you press on it can you get his hand to move  travis give it a little flick  laura thats so messed up  matt nott as you rush up to the shadowed deck of the mist the moonlight still coming down you can  see /none/ the outer shape of the stilldamp caduceus legs tucked into his shoulder leaning back  against the inside of the left hand of the deck or what would be considered the port side  sam mr clay you look are you okay  taliesin i dont know its been a day its hard to gauge  sam yeah are you cold  taliesin yeah  sam i have this cloak that would maybe fit one of your shoulders  taliesin im going to be okay  sam well if you can muster the strength it would be great if you /none/ could come downstairs and  maybe help save an individuals life  taliesin ill get up and go down see whats down there  matt the quarters of this ship its designed to be not a comfortable ship but a fast ship the  crews quarters and the deck below was called for bigger ships itd be the gun deck but its  where the cabin is its pretty tight for a human caduceus youre have to really bend and stoop  down to make your way through but as you come down you find both jester and caleb currently /none/  sitting around an unconscious enforcer one of the cloaked figures that was involved with the crew  that previously had this ship  laura he got an axe in his head  taliesin its probably good you didnt pull it out  laura yeah see  taliesin yeah im going to tap him on the head and cast healing word at 3rdlevel  matt okay  taliesin thats 11 points right there  matt okay  liam as soon as cads hands start to glow i yank the axe out of his head  matt okay you yank it /none/ out and theres a streak of blood and you watch as what would be the open  axe wound begins to slowly seal itself up to the point where its still going to be healing for a  while but it scabbed over instantaneously  sam look you just saved a life thats good news right  taliesin well hell be dead eventually im going to head back upstairs  matt okay  travis fuck me oh god help  matt caduceus heads back upstairs  liam caduceus is america tonight  taliesin too real  matt the person comes /none/ to consciousness immediately as the axe is pulled gasping you  get a better look at him now you can see scruffed probably unshaven for the past two  weeks coming out in tufts it looks like there are parts where the hair isnt growing in because  theres scarring or some sort of heavy acne at a younger age prevented those follicles from  developing pockmarked face weathered from sun and perpetual sunburns you can see the actual  hair itself is a matted greasy mess of a light brown color looks like the kind of person youd  /none/ imagine lives at sea and not in a very monetarily comfortable income  laura oh hi bud  matt whats that who the fuck are you  liam jester this is your axe  laura thank you  liam ja  laura so we have this ship now but i just wanted to say hi welcome to the crew you know were  the mighty nein all your friends are gone right now but its because you attacked us first really  matt just following orders sorry  laura no see thats okay i understand following orders  sam and /none/ laura uhhuh  sam yes we are a tight crew that follows orders as well caleb is our leader and we  laura hmm  sam we are enforcers of justice and saw that justice needed to be done  matt i dont know anything about that  laura what were you guys doing  matt we were delivering a message picking up a message  laura thats it  sam a whole boat just for a message  matt well in his position right now hes being trepidatious in giving you information the  more youre prying the more /none/ hes closing off and his words are trailing off i dont  liam well buddy were at sea now we are not at the dock any more you are trapped with us we  have questions and i dont want to alarm you none of us want to put an axe in your head or anything  laura no i dont want to do that that was really sad  liam right we want to just get along were all tired im tired but ill go to work if i need to  travis oh jesus christ  laughter  /none/ matt make an intimidation check  travis oh my god  laura thats so terrible  travis fuck  travis and marisha but  marisha i was going to say thats how we know caleb is serious but  travis well be listening to him lift that rocking chair outside  liam 18  matt 18 his whole body tenses his eyes dart around the three of you and then slackens and he  exhales in a sense of resignation you know what fuck ill tell you what you want anything you  need to know just can you let /town/ me go drop me back off in town or something  laura yeah i think that seems like something were going to do  liam the easy route is what im talking about good decision  matt yeah well its not worth it he sits up and you see that hes bruised and even though hes  been healed hes not used to the aftermath of physical confrontation the way you guys are hes  like groaning leans up against the table a bit and puts his back against it so hes leaning  against the leg and top of /none/ it groaning  laura who do you work for  liam we have a lot of questions so tell us everything  matt this is the mist were a sister ship to captain avantikas our captain was captain  jawgrasp but i take it you probably killed him too  laura he attacked us first you know  matt well it makes sense were not supposed to leave any survivors whove seen what they  shouldnt have seen general business  laura oh really why  matt just dont want to be followed its part of our directive  sam /none/ are you pirates  matt more or less well just say were not keen on the taxation and enforcement of the concord on  these seas so we do what we feel is necessary  laura i like it  sam freedom fighters  matt yeah  sam you said that youre sister ship to captain avantika  matt the squalleater thats her ship  laura matt and liam the squalleater  sam ah yes we did know that  laura yes we did  liam gesturing to the desk and all the burned papers whats all this then what /none/ was this that  we cant read anymore  matt primarily it was maps to locations of things that were important for our travels  liam like  matt like things that i wasnt the navigator i didnt know specifically but i was told to  burn everything  laura is there some stuff you didnt get to  matt you rummaged through and found a few things most of its scrap and ash or blank sheets that  look like they were scribbled notes in a code that you dont really understand this is the only  visible thing /none/  travis oh yes matthew do us right ooh  liam take care of him i pull out the book and i begin to do the ritual for comprehend languages  to see if that will help with the code its a long shot but ill give it a shot  laura what was the message you were trying to get  matt we were sent by avantika to head back to nicodranas and were supposed to wait for about a  week or two interface with that guy marius either he was going to pay us back for the /none/ money  if he didnt get what he was supposed to find and if he did have what he was supposed to deliver  one of the things i burned was a drawing of it it was an orb thing we were supposed to take that  back to avantika  sam where is avantika  matt avantikas on whats the island called i dont remember dont fucking remember what it  was called it was on there thats it right there  sam is it a secret island  matt its not a secret its just mostly avoided its /none/ near one of the reef clusters of the  lucidian ocean this side of the coast  laura do you see it caleb do you see it  liam im doing a ritual spell for 11 minutes  laura do you think mending would help fix that or would it make the piece of paper come together  travis yeah great fucking call  laura mending  matt all right you do the mending cantrip and because i do not have a completed map for you  well use our imagination  liam dd  matt it completes a much /none/ larger piece of paper that you think would have a bunch of other either  islands or the things around it it looks like it may have been a much larger size unfortunately  the ink does not come through on it  marisha but we still have the ink of that  matt you still have the ink of that yeah its a large piece of paper that is mostly blank and  then theres that one section that is stained with the burned edges and has the actual drawing  liam oh wow so it spread out blank /none/ from thats cool  laura okay  sam so its an island  liam the code was where you said there was a code i thought  matt there was some things with bits of coded language on it it looked like but those have  also been burned and theyre in chunks you do your  liam yeah it takes tenish minutes to do comprehend languages and if im touching  matt is it ten minute casting time  liam it is ten minutes plus one minute as a ritual so yeah  matt as a ritual its whatever /none/ the duration is  liam casting time one action plus ten minutes  matt one action plus ten minutes okay there you go then it would be a total of 11 minutes all  righty while youre working on that you guys can continue to pry if you want  laura if we drop you off are you going to change your name or something are you afraid avantika is  going to come and kill you  matt i mean probably lay low for a while theres other jobs out there find my way back to  darktow eventually /none/  sam tell us about oh sorry  laura no you go you go next  sam oh all right tell us about avantika  matt shes a weird one her whole crew theyve got some weird mystical thing theyre obsessed with  laura like the ball is it the ball  matt thats one of the things were supposed to be picking up yeah theyve got some creepy  religious thing we work for her she hired us as the sister ship out of darktow and weve been  doing errands for her  laura docktow  matt darktow /none/ yeah  laura whats that  matt its generally the hub of most unlawful activity out here used to belong to the concord  but about 50 years back it was taken by people of my professional interests and they havent been  able to take it back since  liam youre talking about a place an island a building  matt yeah its an island  sam wait we already know what the islands are swavain islands i cant even read my writing  thats where we were told avantika is  laura is that what this is swavain /none/ islands  matt swavain islands is the whole series of islands  travis its a cluster out in the lucidian ocean  marisha and darktow is also an island  matt darktow is one of the islands far far west of here though  laura why does it say y y y y  sam i think those could be little pointers  matt im not the navigator but i remember going in and out there were little markers set on areas  where we were supposed to like visual guides if we were on the right paths and to /none/ help us get  through the reef  laura because its on the other side of the reef  matt and to go around is another hundred miles to your trip  liam and youve made this trip yourself  matt yes well weve made to and out once we were going to go back after this  liam what are the risks one would encounter trying to traverse this area  matt are you still working on your spell  liam oh  sam do you live on the island does avantika live on the island  matt oh /none/ god no no ones going to fucking settle on that thing its fucking cursed  sam the island is cursed  matt yeah  sam so she docked there for a while or  matt its supposed to be something there that she wants well shes waiting on us to get back  with whatever were supposed to pick up and if they didnt have it there then we were supposed  to try and find out where the next one might possibly be  sam the next one  laura on the hunt for ancient relics  sam its /none/ a dangerous game who knows how it will end  laura only two will find out  laura and sam yeah  sam oh sorry  travis jesus maybe i jump overboard  sam can you tell us because this is a bit shredded you were here before right you were here  laura thats the island thats where the island is then  matt i think thats the island yeah its mostly junglecovered  sam did the wind blow you out or did you fight against the wind to leave was this east is this  west where is /none/ this  matt i dont know you get the sense the more he looks at it one hes definitely not the  navigator of the ships crew and probably cant read  laura whats your name  matt gallan  laura gallan  matt gallan wesmen  laura i like your name  matt thank you  laura have you heard of the traveler gallan  matt ive met many travelers  laura have you heard of the traveler  matt his eyes go a little narrow hes like oh no not another one  travis another one what  /none/ laura do you want maybe a brochure i could tell you about him  matt im okay  laura you could spread his name wherever you go  matt ill think on it  laura all right  sam youve met avantika right sorry to interrupt i dont want to cut off your weird  evangelizing but youve met avantika  matt ive seen her ive not actually spoken to her that was mainly  sam have you seen her use any magic  matt no she mainly stays on the ship  laura what does she look like  /none/ matt he scratches his head shes elf i think shes got them elven features the pointy ears  the whole brownred skin big hair that comes in strings sleeveless coat high collar big scarf thing  marisha i dont know i got distracted by the sleeveless coat aspect thats all i heard  travis when he gives descriptions and we dont fucking writes notes it bites us in the ass  matt i didnt get all the details i wasnt one of the important ones  laura you should be important  sam you survived this brutal attack you are /none/ extremely strong  matt hes sitting there going yeah yeah youre right  sam everyone else died you had an axe in your head  matt fuck them fuck them im a survivor  sam you had an axe in your head you survived  matt i had a what he reaches back and is like theres like still blood back there of  course and hes like im okay is it bad  sam its nothing to you its nothing missed all the major organs  laughter  sam youre fine  laura yeah  sam what else do /none/ we need to know anything how about this ship you know this ship is there  anything funky on the ship how much food stores do we have how many days of food and water  matt well wed just stocked up so weve got probably about two weeks of tack and water  and some ale below  laura do you know how to sail  matt i know how to repair i was more of the ship carpenter  sam you know what we should do first since we have a carpenter on board  laura what  /none/ sam on the side of the ship it says the mist  laura we should change the name  sam we should get some new letters going  laura like mysterious ball the mysterious ball  sam yes the mistress of the loins i dont know what would be a good name  laura the mistake  sam thats not bad  travis kind of appropriate  marisha the mistake  matt thats really on brand  sam we took the mist and now its the mistake  liam did my spell trigger yet  taliesin theres at least five /none/ jokes in there  matt ill say sure technically ten minutes is a while but well say between the small talk  youve completed your spell  liam only because i want to say the name as it is is fairly appropriate we might want to change  it to change up our appearance and stuff do you know what mist means in zemnian  sam fog  liam it means shit  laura does it  liam yeah manure crap it means crap its pretty on brand for us honestly  laura i dont want to ride around in /none/ the shit  liam youve been doing it for several months now jester  laura you just draw it you dont live in it  liam were going to add on to mistake is funny too i like that can i read this code  matt sure with the slips that you have you read through it and it seems to be a list of supplies  that were supposed to be purchased a lot of them seem to be heavy bits of rope chains climbing  pitons you see ball bearings torches youre not quite sure why this was /none/ encoded per se and  only for the slips that you have that are visible but its mainly just a list of materials  liam okay see these squiggles here this is either just supplies or maybe they are trying to  make booby traps for their island i dont know  sam are there any intact maps like larger scale maps of the ocean  matt unfortunately no you look around you and there is ash everywhere even the air has bits of  ash that are still floating in the space they burned through the purpose of that /none/ battle while  you guys were dealing with all of that this guy was in here torching everything youre lucky  to have gotten that bit  laura man you did a really good job with what you were told to do  matt thanks i take pride in my work hes still touching the wound in the back of his  head unsettled  liam little ridge that hes not used to  sam caduceus are you down here  taliesin oh no im not just me enjoying a head wound  laura well okay im going to go /none/ upstairs  sam all right is he tied up are you tied up  laura hes not tied up  matt no i can come on  liam do

liam thats water under the bridge we just dont want any new problems yeah and theres a lot of  us here so it would be foolish to do anything right  matt yeah  sam you have now officially been conscribed to the mighty nein  laura temporarily  sam for the purposes of this sea voyage at the end of which you will be compensated for your  duties if you kill any of us you will be thrown overboard /none/  laura if you jump overboard well jump after you and well bring you back  sam also as a result of us not mostly knowing how to sail you are also the first mate  matt okay  laura

thaddeus klossowski von musel  marisha the second  matt all right while thats happening the rest of you on the surface where are you taking it  travis time of dayish  matt time of nightish  travis oh shit  matt yeah its maybe 230 300 in /none/ the morning at this point  travis straight out from shore full sail just trying to put distance between us and the coast  matt got you okay  travis i know we have time to decide on our route  matt yeah but you just take some distance in case of pursuit got you its a pretty quick  ship you can see why it was used as a messenger ship youre used to cargo ships and things that  are used for shipping so its nice to have one thats designed just for speed  travis ooh sports /none/ car where is marius  matt hes tied to the mast right now  travis and marisha oh thats right  matt hes fallen asleep as well because hes just been there while you guys were doing your thing  no one is paying attention to him and hes had a long day hes like snoring  travis not to put you too at ease navigating was never really my thing either im better than  most but i do need to decide on where were going  marisha right  travis if we want to use marius were going /dung/ to have to wake his ass up and ask him some questions  marisha you want me to wake him up  travis yeah wake him up  marisha all right okay  travis not stammers  marisha impact  matt ugh  marisha that was gentle right  matt what was that all about  marisha good morning  matt its still dark  marisha dont think that far into it man it was a cool line  matt okay was that necessary  marisha probably not  travis yeah probably not listen well let you go back to /none/ your slumber right quick where were  you headed with this ship i assume to meet up with avantika yeah  matt i wasnt headed anywhere i was going to give back their money and send them off on  their way and you attacked and they werent going to let me stay behind i guess  travis right but now weve changed your plans yes youre with us  matt apparently  travis and avantika needs the sphere correct  matt well i dont have it  travis no but i do do you know where she is ill /none/ reach behind my back and use minor image  again and show the sphere  matt right i dont really i was just hired to pass on a letter and wait for some sort of an  arrival of that and then it never came and then i asked for an extension in case it was just  taking its time to get there and then never showed up so i had to return the money  unfortunately but you know i like keeping a reputation as a reliable messenger  travis who were you going to give this to /none/  matt i was going to give it to whats his name captain jawgrasp big fella you cut  the fuck out of and kicked him off the side of the docks  travis right  marisha how many times have you worked with jawgrasp or avantika in the past  matt this is the second time  marisha and what were you doing for them before  matt well before they found me on the side of the docks here at the wharf and they asked me if i  knew the quickest way to get this letter up /none/ north to shadycreek run  travis shadycreek run where we were you wouldnt happen to know where jawgrasp called  home would you or where he was heading next  matt not a fucking clue none of my business i dont ask questions of those who are you know a  full foot and a half taller than me and can probably wipe the floor with me i just nod  take my money and do the job once again i have a reputation sniffs  travis do you feel comfortable on a ship  matt i feel comfortable all /none/ right you know when i can fucking move sorry sorry im just  a bit grouchy  travis we are kind of limiting him hes got big poofy sleeves and everything hes not going to  swim anywhere  marisha well thats his own damn fault he has poofy sleeves  travis you could rid him of that i hear sleeves are  marisha fucking bullshit  matt i paid good money for this shirt please dont do anything  marisha ripping  laughter  matt you rip them underneath the ropes as he is tied to the mast  /none/ marisha yeah  matt you start tearing them off in chunks hes like no no  travis hey welcome to the crew of the well well have to rename this thing and ill summon  the falchion and just swipe through the ropes  matt ah he starts pulling up the scrap of his sleeves do you have any idea how much i paid for this  marisha throw them overboard  laughter  matt im going to remember this  marisha yeah you should  matt he combs his hair over  marisha it was a pretty fucking dope /none/ thing okay here is the thing this reputation you keep  talking about that you are so deeply concerned about  matt he pulls a tooth out  travis oh pal  marisha aw can i have it laughs deflect missiles  travis that seems unnecessarily adept  matt roll a d10 see how many no  marisha why are you so concerned with this reputation of yours how long have you been  running around in the criminal underworld is what im saying  matt not criminal im not a criminal i do business with whoever pays well i /none/ dont ask  questions so i dont know if ive done any crimes  travis i cant tell i dont know is he an innocent middleman that doesnt know what hes  shipping or is it just  marisha no ive met this type he plays stupid that way if people start asking questions youve  got disbelief  matt exactly so if i dont know technically who im involved with and what the larger scale of my  work is if anybody starts asking questions im as dumb as the rest of them its got me this far  /none/ marisha still doesnt mean youre not a criminal though  matt thats for the people to decide  travis listen what were going to ask for is that you be as forthcoming as you possibly can be  would you mind walking over to the side of the ship there and tell me how far nicodranas looks  right now  matt he goes over and looks cant see it  travis yeah cant see it can you stuck with us so im going to need everything that comes out  of your mouth to be the truth  matt /none/ it has been the truth why am i lying to you right now youve destroyed my shirt youve  made me lose a tooth  travis my goodness he is very sensitive about this im just trying to set the tone for the ship  matt look im a very anxious fellow and when things go ass up im having a breakdown right now  travis do me a favor go below decks and try and find us some drink will you  matt okay sure fine ill do that for you whatever you want  marisha take a little /none/ walk well continue talking when you get back  travis jeez yeah seriously  marisha god i hate him  matt makes his way below deck and passes by these guys  laura hi  matt hi  travis are they coming up  matt yeah they all come out and join you on the deck  sam we found some crucial information  travis oh  laura that guy who i stuck an ax in is actually still alive  travis no kidding  laura yeah caduceus saved his life and hes really nice hes a pretty nice fellow /none/  sam hes your first mate now and  travis axhead is  sam yeah dont worry we took the ax out  laura well caleb did technically  sam and we have this map that goes to the swaven islands we heard the name earlier  matt and marisha swavain  sam thats where well find avantika who seems to be some sort of cultist right  laura yes shes very religious and is interested in relics  sam i mean i assume shes a cultist maybe she just is a very nice religious person  laura maybe she /none/ just likes to collect things  sam yeah but he said creepy  laura he said that they were mysterious and her whole crew had some sort of magicy stuff  travis about the sphere  sam he said that they were supposed to collect this sphere and if it wasnt available to go  look for others how many have you swallowed  travis one  laura imagine if you swallow another one how powerful would you become  liam then youll have two balls  marisha wait does the ball make you powerful is there something going on /none/  travis i certainly feel like i have gained abilities yeah i dont know though is this  where they were headed  sam this is where they were going to head after they got the ball yes  travis this is a map to a reef i know the reefs of the lucidian ocean this is very familiar  laura those are the arrows are the pingpong points that you have to hit and then you get to  the island that you  travis yeah well otherwise you wreck the ship  liam you recognise those specific points /none/ there  travis well theres the everplume reef theres the torrid reef but this looks like the inkclaw reef  matt make a this would be a survival check since this is no for you make that a history  check with advantage since it does fall into your sailor background  travis groans that was less 11  matt it could be one of three reefs  marisha the three you just named  travis there are a lot therere quite a few  matt yeah its a toss up youre not entirely sure which one it is give /none/ me a second i can  probably narrow it down for you give me a second  travis there are a few reefs that protect certain islands one of which is the darktow isle  sam he said that darktow port  travis you dont want to go there  laura he said it was bad  sam but he also said it was far away from the one that avantika was at  laura he didnt make it sound like thats the one that  sam he said it was far away from the one where  travis that /none/ would narrow it to two in my mind if its in the lucidian ocean one is far northwest  of the darktow and one is more straight east by several hundred miles  liam we came here for the two of you what are you after  travis what am i after well id like to see i keep saying avanteeka but its  laura avantika who knows really it could be avanteeka  travis i want to know what she wants the sphere for i want to know why vandren had it in the  first place what else /none/ are they looking for does it have a brother sister sphere i dont know  liam why would we not want to go to this place  travis no i do this doesnt look like darktow to me darktow is more in a u shape you really  have to go around the whole damn thing to get in without touching the reef its a pain in the ass  matt it could be either inkclaw or it could be deep row those are the two that come to mind  sam arent you just a little bit scared that /none/ this person avantika has spent all this time and  resources trying to get these things and youve got one in you and were going right towards her  isnt that a little scary  travis no that sounds great to me  marisha i mean it sounds like she wants this thing  sam but she might just chop you open and take it  travis you wouldnt let her do that would you  laura well try not to i really should sleep if were going to do that though  travis we have plenty of time its /none/ quite a distance away so it could either be the deep row  reef or it could be the inkclaw reef  laura we should really figure it out i wonder if in the morning we can ask gallan about it maybe  he knows one of those sound familiar  sam oh yes yes  travis fair enough well have plenty of time i could well we have to pick one ones to the  northwest and ones down to the southeast from where we are now  sam do we have to pick right now or can we /none/ oh wow those are two different directions laughs  laura well let me go downstairs and wake him up  travis if you want we do have the stars on our side so well be able to navigate easier we could  drop sail and  liam yeah north is that way and i point north  travis oh youre going to be so helpful in this youre the ships navigator i dub thee  the mist navigator  sam its the mistake now we renamed the ship  travis the what the mistake  sam and laura the mistake /none/  sam or the ss mistake  marisha wait are you saying the missteak like a good filet mignon or like a mistake  liam or you could put zemnian and common together and make it the shitake if its the mistake  sam mystake were all about spelling things wrong so maybe we should do that  travis do i remember if the deep row or the inkclaw one is closer than the other  matt the deep row is a little bit further away that ones more to the west of where you guys are  there are /none/ a number of small islands all throughout the various reefs that arent on the larger maps  and you havent been all over the coast these are all just from the trade routes youve done and  the things that arent directly near or youll pass on the trade routes some things arent even charted  travis my knowledge is limited to what ive journeyed through before the inkclaw is closer  we could try there at least set course for that direction how does that sound  sam youre the captain  laura would we get there in two /none/ weeks because thats how much food we have  marisha oh thats a good point  matt well travelwise this would be say we put this at the speed of a longship so per day you  could probably do about 72 miles in a longship it looks like travel to to which reef to inkclaw  its about 230 or so 250 miles from nicodranas  travis yeah we could do it  liam does someone need to man the ship at night when most of us are sleeping  travis yes if nothing else to look out for /none/ other ships  laura and sea monsters  liam can we do that without any sailing experience  matt thats the thing as you consider and you know it takes a number of people to maintain a  ship to go at the speed you would need to youd need to have somebody whos manning the sails  somebody whos navigating the ship somebody whos actually necessary for maintaining the course  travis ill tell you what we could do theres a joint stop on the trade routes an island called  brokenbank we could make it there im familiar /none/ with how we would get there and we could try and  find some extra hands  liam how far off  travis almost oneandahalf times the distance i think ish  sam wait farther  travis yeah ive never sailed directly to the inkclaw reef i just know where it is because ive  seen maps  liam the other thing we could do is find a place on the menagerie coast a good ways away from where  we departed and some of us could try to find a crew also we left the cart behind  laura /none/ and my mom and our puppy  travis yeah we could return to somewhere else along the nicodranas or port damali  marisha maybe we should talk about the whole nicodranas thing really fast  matt as you guys are having this moment of conversation you cant help but notice in the  middle of this talk quiet off to the side yashas just on the outskirts of you holding onto  the rope of the sail she hasnt tied it down yet shes just using herself to hold and maneuver the  sail because thats all she knows but /none/ there is on the far end on the port bow of the ship is  still caduceus legs curled up to the chest looking out over the ocean  laura we should definitely talk about it  travis i didnt mean for that to go the way it did  marisha i dont think any of us did can we return back to your hometown ever again after that  laura that is a really good question  marisha i feel like we might need to drop some  laura stealing comes with a pretty hefty fine so does killing /none/ people  travis yeah its not looking good for us right now  marisha also we have a couple of members of the mighty nein that seem a little bit disparate  laura i walk over to caduceus  marisha ill join  laura um hello  taliesin hey  laura i sit down crosslegged in front of him  marisha i maneuver to the other side but sit leaning up against the ship out of it but here  liam whispers saved by the bell style  laura how are you  taliesin i think its been a day /none/  laura it has  taliesin miss jester do you have a plan  laura hmm wow no i dont think i ever have had a plan  taliesin i did i do i did i dont know  laura what is your plan  taliesin sighs i had a mission a holy purpose a thing that defined me and i thought  that i was honoring it and now what if i was wrong this is not what i thought it was going to be  laura what was your mission  taliesin my home is dying and i /none/ thought this was what i was supposed to do i waited for a sign  and i thought you were the sign and now maybe there wasnt any sign maybe i just left and im  on a ship in an ocean that doesnt want me here its been so quiet and  laura like how do you sometimes hear things  taliesin i always hear things what if i made a mistake  liam i wander over  laura well a lot of times i think that maybe the traveler has left me and i think maybe things are /none/  going poorly and he doesnt like me anymore but sometimes hell just show up after a while and  tell me that i was on the right path all along and he just made it fun for me to find it again  taliesin and one day will be the last time what then  laura youre not afraid of death are you  taliesin no although dying was ive been hurt before and ive almost drowning was a lot  laugh that was a lot and the ocean is a lot and this is a lot  laura /none/ breathe  taliesin deep breathing  laura the world is a lot bigger than your cemetery there are a lot of things for you to  see and you have to break out of your comfort zone in order to find the path that you are  looking for  taliesin i think i needed to hear that breathings hard breathing  laura just keep doing that  taliesin deep breathing it smells really weird in here  laura you cant smell dead people when youre on the ocean  taliesin its very salty  laura yeah  taliesin are /none/ you hungry  laura yes  taliesin im really hungry  laura do you want to make some food we have a lot downstairs two weeks worth  taliesin i like cooking i think i need to cook  laura lets go  taliesin lets go cook really i feel better that was actually really nice im going to go cook  marisha as they walk away and since caleb wandered up do you truly believe the amount of  justification you were just doing for our actions  liam what do you mean that they started it  marisha /none/ everything we just did definitely had a long string of sounded like convincing yourself  and maybe the rest of us and i just wondered how much you actually believed it or how much youre  trying to convince yourself that you didnt fuck up real bad  liam no im good  marisha okay thats great  liam today was not optimal by any means but we have helped our friends mother and she is better  off the things on the dock did not go great no one would use the word great but we did not draw /none/  a blade on them or do anything they attacked us we kept ourselves alive we kept our friends  alive i did not expect us to be departing jesters hometown quite so quickly but here we  are were all alive were helping another one of our friends this is not our home  marisha its not our home but does that give us the right to shit on everyone elses  liam i would not say that we have shit on everyone elses  marisha all right okay i dont know im not looking for answers  liam /town/ which part specifically troubles you most is it the fact that the town might be without  power for a little bit  marisha eh people can adapt  liam they can adapt they have to adapt people have to adapt and that creature down there hes  doing better you cant have a society built on slavery  marisha its just that ive done a lot of shitty things and ive made a lot of shitty  choices and a lot of mistakes and after molly i told myself that i was going to try and not do  /none/ that as much but its fucking hard  liam well there were a lot of innocent people in that death hole and theyre alive because of you  jesters mother is better off because of you alfield is better because of you you have done a  lot of good  marisha can we justify murdering six people to have jesters mom be a little bit better off  liam well they attacked us  marisha okay yep they attacked us and i walk away  travis ill call out to beau as shes walking off  marisha yeah  /none/ travis hows it looking down there spirits high  laughter  marisha uh  travis okay no i thought id ask how are you feeling  marisha conflicted i guess  travis yeah i dont feel very good  marisha i dont know look i know we reacted accordingly and in selfdefense but we probably  could have a been a little bit smarter about that entire situation  travis its been a day right  marisha its been a fucking day  travis we were going to talk to algar we ended up killing his bodyguards and setting that /none/ thing  free and then we were going to go and talk to marius and then we ended up killing the whole  fucking crew and captain minus one  marisha in a part of myself im a little mad because i dont know everything that tortle was  telling us about marius and how he hangs out at the docks and waits until midnight and im like  scoffs what a random fun guy just hanging out by the docks at mid i dont know everything  about that should have connected in my brain that  travis why /none/ didnt we just go talk i feel like weve abandoned the use of heres my thing  right magics new to me this sword is new to me i didnt have most of this all of my life all i  had was my words to get out of situations to try and heal conflict to try and outsmart somebody  now all of a sudden i have this power and i feel like its a shortcut and that ive been cheating  myself i dont feel like ive put forth the same effort to resolve something because i can /none/ just  will something into happening that doesnt seem right to me  marisha in a fucked up way i can actually relate to that quite a lot for me ive always had my  fists and man is it way easier to solve problems when youre beating the shit out of  somebody  travis how does caleb feel about all this  marisha like we were justified in our actions  travis oh really  marisha yeah  travis i dont know just doesnt sit right hows caduceus  marisha jester had a good talk with him i /none/ think hell actually be okay we might need to do a  little bit more maintenance i feel bad ive treated people like shit my whole life and having  one transformative moment doesnt mean that youre immediately going to be a different person  overnight and being better is something you have to work at i guess  travis that was actually very profound  marisha i can understand taking the easy way out with the power that you have its what ive done  my whole life i just dont know anything else though  travis i get /none/ that maybe we try not to do that i check you you check me we check the group  otherwise i feel like caduceus is not going to be the last person that thinks about  marisha walks away from us  travis yeah  marisha ive driven most people in my life away from me hearing him talk like that its not the  first time ive heard those things and i dont want to drive you guys away i dont want us to  drive each other away sighs anyway  travis we need to decide on a /none/ destination whether we turn around and were we in the open  quay or were we in the wayfarers  matt no that was in the wharf  travis were in the wharf  matt yeah the restless wharf  travis the restless wharf we can turn around and come back to the open quay or where the  wharfmaster was and try and get in and out real fast with some crew or we can head to port  damali or we can head out to the open sea but we do need to pick a destination  marisha /none/ is there any damage whoevers there is there any damage control we want to consider in  nicodranas before we fuck off forever  sam damage control  liam well we cant leave without a crew  sam we can send a letter  matt which as a note you would know there are a few different positions that probably need to be  filled there definitely needs to be a captain there needs to be a navigator there needs to be a  quartermaster who is essentially the first mate that is the second in command under the captain /none/  and handles all of the elements there youre going to need some form of a cook someone that  handles and prepares food youre probably going to need a bosun  travis caduceus oh bosun  matt bosun handles the upkeep on the ropes and the sails and general deck upkeep  sam cruise director bursar bartender  marisha standup comic  sam ive seen the love boat  matt there is the carpenter below carpenter does ship repairs and upkeep as well barrelkeepers  are those that maintain the barrels of supplies theres a bunch of different you /none/ dont need all  of these necessarily  travis we dont have any guns theres not guns or powder  matt no this is made for speed not that youve noticed at least  marisha this has turned into a resource management game  taliesin i live for that shit  marisha lemonade tycoon  matt you do see yasha whos still holding the rope but staring off to the south  liam this works out for you you were going to get a boat  matt thats fine i guess  liam know where you want to go  /none/ matt she looks back at you and back at the south and says just looking for a storm  marisha oh  sam fjord should we have a quick ships meeting  travis yes  sam okay crew meeting everyone  matt you guys at this point have gone down and youve been introduced to the wonders of hardtack  which is a lot of essentially hefty crackers shitty shitty crackers  taliesin ive got plans  matt you do find a couple of barrels of fresh tropical fruit which is new for you caduceus  especially shortterm travel elements /none/ there  laura thats good for scurvy  taliesin how well stocked is this kitchen is it stocked at all  matt its stocked at the necessary level for a twoweek journey  taliesin okay ive got the stuff in my set as well so im going to just  matt oh yeah you have everything on you to create and evoke all sorts of unique flavors  taliesin were doing some shit this is on  matt are you calling everybody from the crew together you are in the process of planning it  out and youre taking stock /town/ of everything you have at your disposal and you hear fjord up top calling  you guys  taliesin you know that spicy fruit you can buy on the side of the road were doing spicy fruit  laura that sounds so lovely  taliesin that sounds so good right now im genuinely fiending for it  laura should we go up for the meeting and then come back down  taliesin i think we can bring the bowls up it doesnt take that long  laura oh sweet well bring up and give people food while we have our /dung/ meeting  sam all right  taliesin theres bowls mine mine mine  sam thank you  liam these crackers are terrible  laura spicy fruit its spicy fruit  liam thats why its a bad cracker  travis caduceus thank you for making all this we need to decide on a destination were going to  need more hands that are able to figure out where we are going next  sam to get more hands we could either go back to the place that we exploded and murdered  travis not those docks we could go to a /none/ separate landing site  sam and risk being spotted by the coast guard  laura super disguised  liam who here cannot change their appearance you thats it  sam we cant change the boats appearance  matt yasha is listening out of the corner of her ear and raises her hand and looks back  liam okay youve got the boat  sam or we could go further to  travis port damali  sam port damali or some other place on the coast that i dont know or this other place this  island thats like 300 miles /none/ away  laura port damalis all the way up at the top we could just stop at the next city up  sam whats the next city up  matt next city up would be port zoon  laura port zoon  matt thats about a threeday travel to get there  laura that is a lot of time though to get there  liam we would be exhausted  travis we could turn around and try to go to the where was the wharfmaster the dwarf ingus  matt i think it was ignus  travis ignus  laura /none/ are we seriously considering bringing the ship right back to nicodranas  travis its a different section of the city  sam do we have a lifeboat or any sort of buoy or anything  marisha yes lifeboat is there a  matt theres not a lifeboat per se there is a small row skiff  liam what about pulling into a cove outside of the city a couple of miles and walking in  marisha or we could just leave the boat out in the ocean a little bit and take the skiff in  sam are we hiring /none/ a crew are we kidnapping a crew  travis hiring a crew  sam do we have enough money  travis fuck i dont know  matt youve not hired a crew before you just know what youve worked for which is not a lot  laura how much did you make when you were  travis not a ton  matt its maybe depending on the job two three gold a day  marisha and sam okay  sam we have enough gold  travis our quickest bet is just to turn back into what area was the wharfmaster /none/ ignus in  matt ignus was in the restless wharf  travis it was the restless wharf  laura i guess i could maybe can i try to cast mending on the sail and see if it looks like the  burn damage goes away  matt yeah ill say you can slowly over time focus itll take you about a good hour or so  but you could eventually get the sail to be unsinged  laura maybe i can paint something on the sail so it looks like a different boat  sam ooh yes  liam we /town/ can either pull the name off of the boat or alter it  marisha and liam the mistake  marisha super into it  liam i am too  marisha i have a thought there was something we used to do and sometimes id get hired to do in my  town a little bit of subterfuge if we wanted to try and  travis thats gone real well for us in the past 24 hours but go ahead  marisha well this ones a little bit more under the surface  liam quiet subterfuge instead of loud subterfuge which /none/ is what weve been doing  marisha in fact quiet is the key we used to do little whisper campaigns  sam how so  marisha just going into bars pubs start talking a little bit loudly about the pirate crew and  captain jawgrasp and the hell that he unleashed on the docks the other night  sam oh disparage the deads name so that when people  marisha fuck it hes dead yeah  sam and then when anyone finds out that we did it theyll be like good for them for killing those  bastards right  /none/ marisha i dont even think wed throw our name in the mix  laura we dont ever mention ourselves  marisha never mention ourselves just  liam maybe the crew turned on their captain and killed him on the docks and fled with his ship ja  marisha build a narrative start talking just a little bit louder than what you should in public  maybe whispering to some bartenders  sam seems like it would take days  travis yeah could you do this in a night  marisha well my thought was if we split up a little /dung/ bit you guys focus on hiring a crew  someone else focus on spreading some words  laura we could just sleep before all this stuff happens because damn  travis sure although the more time that passes the longer word has to spread  laura it probably has already spread  sam well its the middle of the night now so its not going to spread till morning right  matt its about this point you look over in the horizon and you can see the faint hint of dark  blue turning to lighter blue  laura can /none/ we just sleep im so tired  sam lets take a nap well just coast here can we coast do we have an anchor can we anchor  travis were a little deep for an anchor  sam can we just do doughnuts  laura can we go to sleep even if were just sailing around  travis sure lets go in circles 12 miles off coast well just go in circles  liam fjord can the boat just be adrift if a couple of us stay up in shifts to make sure that  there are no enemies  /dung/ travis in shifts you can navigate in a pattern yeah  marisha can we slowly in shifts navigate towards a cove  liam none of us know how to steer this thing except for fjord  marisha fuck me  liam i think we just need to cool it  matt you can very faintly see towards the horizon where nicodranas is the occasional little soft  light of the lighthouse youre not completely out of sight of it and when its this dark and you pay  attention you can just barely see that little blip of light  /none/ laura theyre going to see us  sam we dont have any light on here  matt yeah theres no light on the ship  laura theyll see us when it gets lighter  sam were fine  laura im going to go sleep okay bye  sam the plan is were going to find a cove and hide the ship sneak in get some crew sneak  back or were just going to sail right into a different port also in nicodranas grab a crew  while we start a whisper campaign and bolt  travis yes i dont /none/ know either one of those is fine  marisha sounds insane  travis yeah i vote for sailing up outside of the wharfmaster area taking a little skiff in just  getting some crew and getting the fuck out of here  marisha we can always pull in the ship really fast to load on the crew and then peace out  travis id keep the ship out of there just in case the zello the jello  matt zhelezo  travis zhelezo have come up and said exaggerated accent there was a ship and the fireball  detonated on /none/ the side of it and ours has a bunch of burn damage  liam why are you talking so funny  travis i dont the splinters are in my forehead  marisha lets sleep so tired  liam sit up with me for a little bit well take the first shift  sam are you talking to me or  liam you nott the brave  laura and taliesin good night  matt all right you guys take shifts throughout the evening to the early elements of the morning  liam yeah late morning can i just take a moment /none/ with my goblin friend while theyre sleeping  matt sure  liam come here look i want to show you something  sam what  liam you want a piggyback  sam yes  liam skitter up  sam skittering  liam you see the sun is coming up but you can still see one or two up there you see that one  sam the stars  liam thats a planet that one thats another place  sam no were on the planet  marisha laughs yes  liam today was a major clusterfuck everything went wrong we did /none/ all the wrong things  sam it didnt feel very good did it  liam no but do you know what worries me more is the feelings im getting from everyone in the  crew theyre a little despondent all of them  sam what do we do about that  liam i know that it didnt go very well but this is our new family right we want the family  to stick together i think we need to oh youre over here i think we need to lead by example  sam you mean just laugh extra hard /none/ and pretend like were having a great time  liam keep their morale up i think is all i mean we have done good things i know that the  day was it was a day but we want this to keep going  sam yes  liam we care for these people ja  sam absolutely and we want to stay together and if theyre thinking that this is not working out  we have to do something to change that i dont know about going in and starting to lie to a bunch  of people is that /none/ going to make them  liam we definitely need to think more than just wing it you know this group we get under each  others skin and we all egg each other on and we like to wing it so maybe we need to slow things  down but i am serious the thing that i am worried most is they feel like its fracturing  and we cannot let that happen  sam all right ill start thinking about what we can do  liam also are you mad about the swimming thing  sam oh no you /none/ did what you had to do i needed to be with the group otherwise i wouldve been  stranded there alone and that wouldnt have been good next time you can just tell me though  liam tell you when im going to mess with your head a little bit  sam yeah its all right i need it  liam i thought it would help  sam it did temporarily im still very scared of the water and i like being on the boat but  getting off is going to be a trick but its all right yeah /none/ yeah were cool its just these  other people thatre all messed up  liam whispering theyre losing their cool  sam i know well keep them together if all else fails fake a heart attack everyone will go to  your aid and then when they save you well be like yeah we saved him yeah  liam i dont know if youre joking or not but im going to do it  sam okay good  liam and there really is another world  sam no were on the world  liam fine  matt nott is a /none/ one earther all right you guys keeping first watch make a perception check  whoevers maintaining that either advantage or you both roll independently  sam and liam independently  sam 14  liam its a perception 22  matt keeping an eye out you begin to watch as multiple ships begin to cruise out from  nicodranas at first you begin to get nervous but watching them you can see its the early morning  right as dawn hits a lot of these fisherman ships start going out and finding sections where lots of  schools tend to come /none/ to feed beyond that you dont see any encroaching danger  sam are there any distinct flags or colors hanging from our rigging  matt you have sails there is a flag that sits at the top of the main mast but it is currently tied up  sam okay can i skitter up there and see what it is if it were to unfurl  matt its big so youd have to unfurl to see it  sam can i pull it down is there a thing  matt yeah you can bring it down you bring the flag /none/ down and open it up and its a light gray  flag that looks almost like a curled wave it looks like a wave of water that curls away thats  the best you can ascertain as to what the design means  sam well ask fjord about it when he wakes up  matt you guys finish your shift whos taking next shift  travis ill go second  matt okay  sam on the crossover does this mean anything to you  matt it does not  travis it does not  sam maybe we should change it /none/ on the next crossover tell jester to paint it  travis its going to be a giant dick and balls if we do  sam thats fine  travis okay  matt whos taking next shift its fjord and just fjord fjord and caduceus out there for  second shift  travis how you doing  taliesin i think im embracing the chaos  travis oh yeah thats a good way to deal  taliesin do you have a plan  travis a plan  marisha youre asking everyone oh no  travis i have a series of expectations but /none/ i wouldnt call it a plan  taliesin i dont get it but okay  travis im in pursuit of something and i know what maybe the next couple of steps are but past that  taliesin thats an answer thatll do yesterday was oh god whats the word  travis heavy  taliesin heavy heavys good yeah  travis i take it you havent seen much combat  taliesin well ive fought animals a few bandits  travis you ever fought a giant water genie  taliesin no no that was a first  travis me neither never even /none/ seen one before  taliesin is life always this directionless  travis yeah well yeah my new life pretty much yeah its open  taliesin the one with the hair i think shes going to take off again  travis yasha  taliesin yeah  travis what makes you say that  taliesin oh you know how it is some rocks dont sit right  travis yeah do you naturally have the ability to feel that out of people  taliesin i mean yeah  travis its very insightful  taliesin well my job for most of my life was /none/ to talk to people well it wasnt to talk to people  it was to listen to people ive listened to a lot of people  travis for your job  taliesin yeah its a graveyard people come and they talk a lot  travis when theyre grieving  taliesin yeah and you listen a lot i dont know much but i know people and i know things that  arent people theres a lot more apparently  travis you seem to pick up on the stuff thats not said  taliesin you have to i like that youre looking /none/ for something thats good  travis otherwise i dont really know what id be doing  taliesin well i hope we find it because then youd get to figure out what to do next and then  therell be two of us who would be wondering  travis fair enough okay  taliesin im definitely looking out on the ocean to see if  matt yeah perception check from each of you  travis ill give you advantage  taliesin ill do the double yeah yeah thats not bad 21  matt keeping an eye out on this as well /none/ you towards the end of your shift notice one ship  that isnt one of the fishermen ships or one of the traders ships that youve seen in the docks  and pointed out to you it is one of the zhelezo search ships its not leaving too far from the  docks but its at least patrolling around the outskirts  taliesin is that a sign that maybe we should really leave  travis i think well expand our travel pattern to skate out wider  taliesin sometimes its worth owning a mistake and i think yesterday was a /none/ big mistake  travis we dont necessarily want to own that here they are very stern about mistakes  taliesin well by owning it i mean stop trying to necessarily fix it and let it be a mistake  travis i agree with that  taliesin and maybe just  travis move on  taliesin admit that there might be no fixing this  travis i think thats wise  matt the ship does have a wide berth its only one ship thats going across the entire coast  there but thats one thing youve noticed its a danger  /none/ taliesin going to have some thoughts about that flag too but thats for tomorrow  matt okay you guys finish your time at watch the rest of you come to consciousness its now  late morning going to be approaching the afternoon fairly soon but youve woken up some  food has been devoured your cabin mate gallan has come to consciousness and has instinctually  gone to start looking at the side of the boat and starting to repair bits of the fireball damage you  had left pulls out his tools starts going to work on that  /none/ liam that was good work  laura found a carpenter  matt marius is choking through some hardtack what do you guys want to do  sam were going back find a cove  travis well make our way up to the docks where the wharfmaster is which is a separate docks from where  sam its the same city right  matt same city the restless wharf and the open quay are two large sections of docks on the north end  travis remember it took a while to walk from one to the other and were only taking /dung/ the skiff in  laura plus it was dark when we left and nobody saw the  travis and only people that dont look like us can take the skiff in to get the crew that were  going to look for  liam i dont know couldnt the name of this boat be on a ledger or something somewhere  travis what the mistake  laura good thing we changed it to the mistake  matt you do know that when ships check into port you have not been in charge of it but  youve seen it usually /none/ there is a ledger of ownership or deed of ownership to the ship that  the captain presents to the wharfmaster so that they can keep tabs on who comes in and comes out  sam do we have one on this ship  marisha not for the mistake  matt it got burned  laura singing guess what i can do i can make things  sam if youve seen one before  laura fjord can tell me what they look like  travis can i  matt you can probably get the gist of it lets give it /none/ a shot you can certainly try  travis okay lets try to forge a pink slip for the mistake  laura to fjordie  liam but also the mist is printed on the side of the boat we have not changed that have we  sam weve got to chip that off carpenter first mate  matt yeah  sam hold your carpentry duties for now and go change the name of the ship  matt okay to what  sam the mistake no one will know  matt great  sam in a different font  matt i would /none/ love to help you little goblin girl however i cant really write or read  laura is it painted on or is it chipped on  matt its painted on  laura i can do that  liam youre an artist  sam back to your duties please  matt right he goes back to repairs  taliesin is the flag going to be a problem  laura well we dont have to unfurl it  taliesin but will they know what the flag looks like will that be part of the information that  exists about the ship  /none/ travis i am an actor in real life you should probably ask matt  taliesin which is why im asking you and hoping you make eye contact with the game  matt as far as you know they dont check the sails the sails are designed to show allegiance  to certain areas if for whatever reason the ship was searched and a sail was found that  perhaps was known to be not kosher with the laws of the coast then that would be a problem but  thats only if the sail itself is  taliesin but the /none/ flag is it possible someone might recognize the flag  matt its possible you probably wouldnt want to go into port with the flag unfurled  travis they dont even have to board us because were going to stay out in the river were just  taking the skiff in  marisha maybe burn the flag  taliesin i could dye it  marisha ooh  travis how about we get into the docks first so we can get some crew  laura okay ill rewrite the name at least on the side of the ship  matt okay in /none/ order to do so youll have to dangle from the actual stern of the ship  laura yasha hold my ankles  matt yasha looks confused okay i guess and turns you over and holds you off the side straining  yashas even having to wedge against the side because to get you further enough down its about ten feet  from the stern so yashas having to get her foot caught up underneath the railing  sam keep doing this motion  matt jeez  laura im holding paint  sam oh this is the paint can upsidedown  /none/ laura yes  sam and youre dipping  laura im dipping because im hanging upsidedown  matt gif of the week right there you manage to write in a really extravagant well practiced  jester way the mistake on the back of the ship yasha lifts you back on board any other  preparations you guys want to do  laura we should disguise ourselves  sam should we leave anyone on the ship  marisha jester you have a disguise kit right  laura i do  marisha would you do my makeup for me could you disguise me /none/  laura of course yes of course i can  sam do we need to leave someone on the ship  travis i should probably stay on the ship  sam no youre the charmer ill stay on the ship  matt yasha goes ill stay  laura yashas going to stay on the ship  travis do you know how to move the ship if you need to all of a sudden  matt no  travis then ill stay on the ship you guys go on take a big bunch of money go get the crew  what /none/ is the argument to that  sam how am i going to go convince crew to work for us  travis youre not  sam then what am i supposed to i have no job out there  marisha whispering whisper campaign  sam i can do that  taliesin this is going to go so poorly  sam whos going to hire a crew we dont even know the parts of the boat that we need to fill  you have to come with us  travis ill write a list  sam no yasha stays with our first /none/ mate gallan  travis listen last time the only guy who could move the ship was below deck im not leaving my  wingman im not making this mistake a second time  sam if yasha has to move the ship she might as well abandon it theres nothing she can do shes  not going to outrun a naval vessel  travis no im staying on the ship  sam what are you going to do youre one man youre going to sail the ship away  travis yeah youll stay with me ill make you the little lackey /none/ that moves shit  sam sputtering sighs  travis ill keep marius and ill keep gallan  sam i dont like this  liam how close to the shore do we get with the ship the ship proper  travis i dont know a quarter mile off the coast a couple hundred yards i dont know how  close do you get to the ship if you want to take the skiff in  matt youd have to get fairly close to even drop anchor and you dont want to have to row  liam you picked a sailor man /none/  travis i know i wished id picked an astronaut then i wouldnt be fucked  laughter  matt the strangest of wildemount backgrounds you have to get pretty close unless you want somebody  to be rowing that boat for a long time  travis which i do because i want to punish them  matt honesty i appreciate that  travis 150 yards  matt okay thisll be interesting youre helming the ship  travis based off the last game right  sam what will you be able to do by staying on the ship if another vessel /none/  travis what if a zhelezo ship comes around and arrests yasha we can at least get  sam no if youre on the ship and a zhelezo boat comes out  travis we drop sail we take off and i leave you guys in the cove  sam with one person  travis yep  matt okay as youre making your way towards nicodranas having this conversation the zhelezo  ship is doing its patrol across you have to time the best way to come through without gaining its  attention who wants to be in charge of trying /none/ to navigate the ship  sam you youre the sailor  matt that would be you i think fjord make an intelligence check and ill give you advantage  because you have a sailor background and you understand some of the pathways especially since  watching and noticing this earlier with caduceus youve seen it move back and forth  travis 16  matt the zhelezo ship passes by and it begins to inspect another ship that is coming in from the  western trade route  laura should i draw up the deed  matt okay you want to /none/ make a forgery of it  laura should i be okay im doing that as were going in and stuff  travis this is very complicated  matt as youre watching this youre also helping tell jester what you think might be included in  the paper that youve not really seen make  travis i have not really seen  laura i thought you said you had  matt youve seen the papers but you havent studied very heavily what is contained on these  travis what would the point be because the wharfmaster thats all he looks at /none/  sam do it in a different language what other languages do you speak  laura oh good question i speak infernal  sam a hell boat is that really the only other language you speak is infernal  laura yeah  sam what are you  matt shes a tiefling if youd like to make a forgery check  travis im open to all fucking suggestions i just wanted to park a boat and go get some crew  matt roll a d20 and add your intelligence modifier and your proficiency because you are  proficient with forgery  /none/ laura i hate that its intelligence  taliesin thats an impressive roll  laura 20  matt holy shit okay you craft what is probably the most evenlyconstructed and in some ways  beautiful deeds to a ship it has borders on it the signature thats on there looks very formal  and probably from some naval captain  taliesin and yet somehow theres a dick in the signature  matt yeah its subtle  travis the filigree on the borders theres little nut sack  matt youre not sure what the content would require but youve seen a few /none/ formal documents in  passing and you make it up as you go and you hope its enough youre proud of it but you hope its enough  laura this is really pretty  sam dont forget to spray it with perfume  laura oh right a little lavender oil right in the corner  matt okay are you taking it in to dock or are you waiting outside and taking the skiff in  laura we should take it to the dock  matt its up to you  sam and laura that way we have you  travis /none/ lets take it into dock against all the advice of zhelezo looking for a burned ship that  had a fireball  laura it doesnt look burned anymore does it  liam jester has fixed the sail  matt the sails been fixed  travis blackened charred wood on the outside of it in a sphere shape  marisha i thought we fixed did we fix that did we fix the black sphere  matt the wood is being repaired but its a few days of repair to get all that taken care of  liam also the fireball went /none/ off the side of the ship so the edge of the ship would be burned  travis i like it lets go into the dock i love this plan  marisha we always make these plans and then abandon them  matt thats dd man thats how it works  sam no lets take the skiff in if you want to take the skiff we can take the skiff  travis nope this is an adventuring party lets go into the dock  matt okay restless wharf or the open quay  travis the one that we were not just /none/ killing people at  matt open quay okay you make your way towards the open quay thankfully you timed it so that  the one patrolling zhelezo ship that you see is currently invested in another ship that its  interfacing with you make your way to the open quay you make it to the docks  laura disguise self as we get closer  matt all of you that are on there and youre applying a disguise kit to beau if you wouldnt  mind rolling a d20 add your dexterity modifier and your proficiency modifier  travis we /none/ will tell marius and gallan to stay below the entire time  marisha good call  travis and yasha  laura 18 plus three  sam yashas staying on the boat with  matt yeah yashas staying below and keeping an eye on the rest of your crew with that youre  approached at the docks the dockmaster there takes your document is going to inspect it and  rolled pretty well but you rolled a 20 he looks and seems to be taken aback at how well designed  versus the occasional chicken scratch and heavily stained ocean airtattered /none/ pieces of paper are  handed to him seems to accept it and you guys make your way onto the open quay docks youre  there you drop anchor what do you wish to do while youre here  marisha i hand off 20 gold to caleb here heres for hiring crew  liam okay  sam are there any yes  marisha youre with me on the whisper campaign  sam i am the whisper campaign  marisha thats what im talking about  sam but wait before we go is there anyone walking about the docks you know /none/ like dockhands  matt oh plenty  sam okay should we buy anyone off to be like this ships fine we checked it  laura to say that weve been here awhile or something  sam yeah or if anyone comes asking theyre like oh yeah these guys just came in from i dont  know marquet or something  matt if anybody that would be the dockmaster  liam the dockmaster is the one person whos in charge of the whole area  travis the wharfmaster ignus  matt well thats in the other side thats up at the /none/ restless wharf  sam the guy we just gave the papers to  matt yes  sam go bribe him  laura give him five gold  sam ten gold do it  travis you want me to do it  sam yeah youre the sailor guy this is your whole episode  travis sure ill go find that guy with five gold  matt okay you approach this is a human fellow lanky with a very pronounced adams apple and a  cleft chin big sideburns and this mop of reddishbrown hair a thick sweater on that  bunches /none/ up around the neck he turns back as you approach hi can i help you  travis yes were trying to get in and out of port as fast as we can looking to acquire a few  crew members would you do me a favor though ill produce the five gold and say would you mind  telling any inquiring minds that weve been here for awhile and that were coming from  matt youre on the mistake  travis the mistake thats correct yes and we are coming over from what was the port in  between port /none/ damali and this one  matt well theres two but port zoons the closest  travis yeah were out of port zoon and were just trying to get there and back in the same  day if we can  matt make a deception check  travis 15  matt he gives you a nod and goes to shake your hand and goes understood slips the coin into  his hand all right in and out real quick take the paper folds it and hands it back to you  travis is there a posting for people looking for crew /tavern/ positions a sign  matt for that youre probably going to look outside of the seafloors bounty or probably on  the board at the withered bird inn  travis okay  matt seafloors bounty or the withered bird inn  taliesin nothing like a bar with withered in the name  laura yeah right  matt welcome to the open quay what are you guys doing while youre here  laura hiring crew and were going to get some food for the thing  taliesin were going to need food and supplies so anything that you think that we /none/ might need  ill go pick that up  travis ill tell them the amount of supplies that i think they need to pick up for a months worth  of travel  matt okay thatd be a lot of additional rope some repair materials for the ship maybe an  additional set of tools a couple of empty barrels just in case you need them actually  quite a few barrels if youre going to be buying a lot more food because right now since they had  stocked up with what they had felt they needed just for /none/ their crew and the short trip they were  making their way there if youre stocking up for a while youre going to need more means of  transport and storage  laura okay ive disguised myself to look like an old grizzled sailor  matt perfect okay it takes you a few hours but you gather the materials that are needed the total  matt cost for all of the materials together for all of you is it food for a month as well  taliesin ill even go so far as to say good food for a month /none/ im going to bake some shit fuck it  i also know that i can create food if i have to so i can do a lot of like base  matt for a month thats going to be about id say 300 gold  taliesin i do not have 300 gold  matt if its good food for all of you guys and the people that youre hiring on the crew to feed  all of you every day for a month  liam how about mac n cheese  taliesin whats adequate food  matt adequate food will /none/ put you at about 100 gold  laura well lets do that ill do 50 gold and you do 50 gold  taliesin ill do 50 gold plus ill up my spice to make do  matt okay its still better food than most sailors have on long trips for that cost thats  for you and the entire crew youre hiring and the two you have on your ship for a month okay so  you acquire that bit  liam i would say that i look like a somewhat plump good zemnian boy blond and a little rounder /none/  matt ach ein zemnian boy  liam ja a little bit  sam augustus gloop  matt augustus gloop exactly  liam dont make me run im full of chocolates i saw fjord talking to the wharfmaster so i will  wait until fjord is finished and then i will go up and talk to him as well  matt okay cool  liam excuse me we have been doing very well on our travels at sea and we are looking to share  the duties and want to hire a bigger crew i know theres many docks around /tavern/ here but why wouldnt i  start here of course do you know is this a good place is there anyone whos looking for work  right now were going on a journey oh you know three or four or five or six weeks perhaps  onetime job  matt glances at you glances at you glances back yeah if youre looking to hire youll  find most of them at either the posting at the seafloors bounty or the withered bird inn  liam oh im so sorry did you cover that already  matt yes but now both /none/ of you are informed  liam excellent  matt so good luck  sam i come wandering up  laughter  sam shouting we need a crew  matt ugh  sam i look like capn crunch by the way  laughter  sam all right we know what were doing right  liam for real though like a realworld capn crunch  sam yeah short hat white moustache  matt im so happy this campaign you guys have a mostly deceptive illusorybased party this  really makes for a lot of shenanigans you guys start looking for a crew /none/ to hire how many crew  are you looking to hire  travis seven no six crew of six  matt crew of six you have two with you already  laura yeah and you can be the captain  liam carpenter captain so we need a boatswain  travis we need a boatswain well weve got the cook we need a quartermaster we need a  navigator and a captain if we dont need a cook or a carpenter  liam what came between boatswain and navigator  matt a barrel keeper  liam okay  matt youve worked /none/ as a boatswain before thats primarily what youve done as well as some  element of barrel keeping in your travels those are primarily what your skills would fall under  travis sweet lets call it a crew of five  matt okay  travis captain navigator quartermaster cook and another boatswain slash barrel keeper  marisha can you be a cook  taliesin i am a cook  matt make an investigation check  travis me  matt yes  travis ten  matt ten okay  taliesin i look like shaggy from the special episode of scooby doo /tavern/ where hes pretending  to be a pirate  matt you find a few folk that are pretty good so you hire pretty much for all the other positions  you need the navigators the one youre having a hard time with everyone youve talked to is like  yeah i can sail the sea and youre like hm nah youre having a harder time finding a navigator  sam maybe we should go elsewhere  travis yep  sam lets go elsewhere  travis yep  marisha wait are we at a bar or something  travis no were /none/ at the docks right now well go to the seafloor bounty first  liam seafloor bounty  matt all right im assuming in this degree youre going to these places to find these hires  as opposed to having to roleplay every interview with each of these crewmen  taliesin its been awhile i dont know sorry  matt thats true  travis we never know we might kill them so  matt yeah thats possible  marisha if we stop at any bars along the way whispering whisper campaign  liam do you know what this is reminding me /none/ of though is getting the crew for our keep in the  last home game  taliesin that was totally what i was thinking about  matt kind of  taliesin we also make them fight and try to kill each other  matt so whisper campaign one of you make a deception check and one of you make an  investigation check  sam ill do investigation  marisha okay ill do deception natural 20  matt oh shit  taliesin thank god  sam its not a roll not great investigation 17  matt 17 thats pretty good /none/  sam wasnt a good roll but i have a lot of plus  matt there you go all right what whispers do you want to disseminate  marisha i disseminate that these ruffian pirates coming in messing up our nice and peaceful  nicodranas again i heard it was that captain jawgrasp he came in and he deceived his own crew  and he murdered them all in a plot of vengeance and greed and then he took the boat and he went  off on his own  matt all right as youre spreading this rumor you start /none/ hearing people responding to that being  like jawgrasp wasnt he found dead at the docks the other night  sam lets adjust  matt hold on you do find out that a number of the corpses that were gathered the two names that  you find are captain javeed jawgrasp and mattheus freecall they were both known criminals that had  bounties on their head in one hand there is a search for or at least there is an understanding  that some unknown dogooders were responsible for killing two people with bounties on their heads  however there /none/ was a blueskinned tiefling that killed herself on the dock and people are trying  to find out information theyre searching for the body and theyre trying to find out who that was  apparently a ship was taken from some of the surviving crew of these people youre getting the  idea that the guards didnt realize there was a conflict happening and just assumed that whoever  took the boat you guys were members of this captain jawgrasps crew  liam the rumor were trying to spread is what they already think  sam the whisper campaign succeeded /none/  marisha succeeded yeah were already great  sam but we should adjust it right if theyre looking for jester why dont we put in a little  doubt right theyre looking for a blueskinned tiefling why dont we just say oh i heard it  was a greenskinned dwarf or something like that just do a little confusion so maybe theyre not  sure who it was who killed herself on the dock i heard she was already crazy or something like  that and then maybe the ship that was taken didnt it have that distinct threemast silhouette /dung/  that you would definitely recognize  marisha yeah oh yeah  sam yeah we could do some of that  marisha it was so dark but the sails seemed black like the heart of captain jawgrasp  sam yeah sure  marisha just like his soul  sam a little flourish  marisha yeah maybe this we got to come up with something better than greenskinned dwarf thats  not a real thing  sam what  taliesin thats how we do it at home is you raise your hand  sam what is it mr clay we want /none/ your input as you are definitely part of this team  taliesin i see what youre doing and i like it i like a good ghost story maybe  marisha ooh this is getting so complicated with each layer  taliesin maybe they saw everybody knows the legend of the little devil girl who drowned a  hundred years ago  sam and you see her every hundred years  taliesin every now and then someone reports about seeing  travis jason voorhees jester  liam yes more often than a hundred years  taliesin everyone loves a good dock /none/ tour like a haunted dock tour  liam and marisha thats true  taliesin well i like a haunted tour ive never actually been to a dock now that i think about it  marisha she drove the captain mad with the vengeance  laura no he drove her crazy with love and she killed herself because she couldnt be with him  marisha yeah now her spirit lives on and she is haunting sailors looking for her longlost lover  laura i love it  matt all right youve planted the seeds of this ghost story on the docks /none/ in an attempt to coopt  the story of this blueskinned horned tiefling youve also disseminated the information that  jawgrasp died somehow in line with this ghost story  marisha im just saying spooky coincidences  sam the curse  matt well see if it sticks youve set the seeds  marisha we once again put misinformation out about the boat  matt okay  laura and marisha what it looked like  matt okay remember everything youve heard are all been common rumors people just talking who  hear the whispers youre saying and the tales and retorting /none/ with what theyve heard in the past  morning because there was hubbub people there are discussing what they saw or heard about what happened  liam rumors only grow  matt but you havent seen any of the guards that were present all right cool while thats  happening youre all still trying to find a navigator  liam find that navigator did we find the rest  matt make an intelligence check  liam oh 14  matt 14 okay you have met one navigator before  laura gasp i remember  liam i do not  laura /none/ was it orly  marisha i think it was orly  liam was it within the last month then you have to tell me who it is  matt thats what i did its orly  liam she said orly you didnt confirm it  matt i was waiting to see if youd pick up on it  taliesin oh really  matt oh thats going to cost you caduceus intelligence just went to eight  taliesin that was all me that wasnt caduceus ugh  marisha lets go get orly  sam hes in the other port  travis /none/ thats all right go get them we dont look like ourselves  liam yeah well walk there we need turtle power  sam how long is the walk  matt from here id say carefully about an hour  sam an hour wed have to respellify ourselves  laura we can send a message to him  sam oh how do you send a message to him you mean like spell message  liam ja  sam hes not going to respond to that  taliesin if theres money involved  laura yeah hold on  sam all right think /none/ hard about this  laura this is a powerful spell  liam offer money from the getgo  sam come to open quay  laura come to the mistake in the open quay  sam lose all the thes  laura come to mistake in open quay weve got money for you as a navigator  taliesin job opportunity  sam you still have more words  marisha should we say were the mighty nein we met you the

the massive waddling form /none/ of  the tortle with the sack over the shoulder the rest of the deckhands look and give a nod some  recognize him others are still like fucking tortles theyre weird then eventually makes his  way to the ship over to the skiff and goes oh no you guys have the ship in dock you brought it  all in there he walks over and steps up onto the gangplank so whom who am i talking to  travis me apparently  matt hey there its real good to see you again i heard from some mmmysterious magic /none/ voice that  you were going to hire someone to navigate  travis we were

as he arrives  sam were trying to be quiet  liam a full scottish send off when we leave  matt yeah you know /none/ the more you hear it the more youre like eh its not that bad  actually its the initial note that kicks in and once you get used to it its not bad  liam it breathes better in open space  matt yeah all right with your crew and supplies acquired and  marisha we did it  matt  possible seeds of whispers disseminated some information gained about the scenario of  those that you killed on the dock the night before and the knowledge that theyre still  searching for the rest of the crew you make /none/ your way off the dock are you going to try and pass by  the zhelezo ship once more because youre going to have to to make your way out  travis well then yeah  marisha can i assist him with counting as they go by  matt actually with orly hired and helping you out with this did you tell orly you were trying  to avoid that ship  travis yes  matt orly goes i think this helps me know what kind of business we into okay with advantage on  that nice all right quickly /none/ telling you all right go now round about that way he begins  giving you the proper timing and based on your previous information without issue you manage to  dodge the zhelezo ship make your way to open waters and now in the later afternoon you guys  have now exited the outskirts of nicodranas well see how much of what youve left behind helps to  what you left behind the night before but nevertheless you have a crew you have supplies  and you are on the water with that were going to go ahead and

the full one going to be  matt pretty big  disappointed groaning  matt i know next week possibly at the live show there we go that can be something for you  to reference for your travels on the menagerie coast  marisha i keep sharpening it and its just shit  liam rose gold  sam russian accent rose gold is best gold regular accent im wearing an apple watch with a  /dung/ rose gold band on it  matt oh sam  marisha mine and matts wedding rings are rose gold  sam russian accent it is the best color  matt mimicking accent it is good for for wedding materials as well yes  regular accent mighty nein you have your crew this is a pretty packed ship for a runner ship  because you have a full crew and then on top of that you have you guys as opposed to training  as sailors youve hired more on top of what you have so now you have a very /none/ busy ship however  you are out and about on the ocean what are you guys going to do where are you going whats  the plan orly needs something  sam yeah weve got to show maybe this jogs orlys memory orly why am i showing this to  you but here heres a piece of a map we retrieved wed like to go there but keep it  secret from the rest of the crew  laura is that the inky claw reef  matt he compares it with the map and goes bbest i can tell its /dung/ probably close to the  inky claw you know  sam oh you were right fjord  travis youre off the boat  matt what  marisha take your gold and leave  taliesin why do they call it the inky claw  travis why do they call it the inky claw  matt from what you know partially because the waters around there are very murky and very dark  so its hard to see where the reef comes close to the surface a lot of the sea creatures that live  in the area tend to knock a /none/ lot of the silt up thats close to the bottom of the reef which  means sometimes the reef sneaks up on you and rakes across the bottom of the ship itself  travis because we have this map and we have a navigator that doesnt mean that we can go from  one destination on a map that we saw to another we still need to follow the trade routes right  matt you can it just means that anything thats off the trade routes means there is not a  lot of patrolling zhelezo ships to maintain protection /none/ for people that are using those lanes  it also means that sometimes as youve heard certain creatures that live in the ocean or  nearby youre a little more susceptible to but its a quicker route if where youre heading is  the inky claw  liam roads its just like roads off roading it or roading it  marisha well i mean it looks like theres not a main trade route  travis yeah if we stay on the trade route we have to go here and then down and then come  across or we go here /none/  laura lets offroad it  taliesin as the crow swims  sam laughs as the crow swims  travis laughs do crows swim  liam sure  matt youre telling orly to head to where  travis well i want to make everyone aware of the dangers okay if we take the trade route it will  take three and a half times longer to get there than if we just go from point a to point b but  point a goes across uncharted waters and on this map there are giant tentacles coming out of the  /none/ water probably just for flavor  laura i told you sea monsters  travis could just be artists interpretation to try and fill in blank space doesnt mean anything  liam theres tentacles on the map  laura i cant tell anything about whats happening here port damali nicodranas  travis nicodranas and the inkclaw is down to your lower right hand corner  sam those could just be vines  taliesin literally cant tell what that is  matt sea vines  travis theyre like little sea cucumbers  liam tgif flair is all that is  travis we /none/ also have this map which is at the top of the inkclaw reef that will guide us through  the reef instead of coming this direction and then down and underneath which is what you would  probably be doing  laura lets do it  travis all right well instruct orly  sam not only will we do it we will do it in solidarity with you and your quest because  we are a team a cohesive unit that acts as one when one member wants something we all want  something right guys  liam ja of /none/ course we are the mighty nein not to be trifled with welcome to the mighty nein caduceus  sam put it in  travis put what in the map  liam no she means your hands  marisha both hands or just one  laura and yasha  matt yasha puts one hand in as well  sam on three ocean one two three  all ocean  travis is that a goblin thing  sam now its a  laura and sam its a mighty nein thing  marisha yeah we have a thing  sam its a new /none/ thing  travis were going to instruct orly to navigate from north to south to the top of the reef using this  matt orly corresponds and is like just out of personal curiosity why are we heading through the  reef where are we going  travis we are trying to catch up with a captain that we need to make contact with  matt all right well this captain youre talking about mmmay be where that x is on the paper  travis i think they might yep  matt so thats putting us right by the island /dung/  laura which island  matt he points to just on the outskirts of the x the land mass  laura oh that island  matt according to my map right here that is urukayxl  travis and sam urukayxl  laura i see it yes i see this map  matt thats a real avoided locale  laura why  matt superstition many folks around here they talk about the dark stories of dense jungle and  very dangerous ironbearing creatures they talk of strange ancient mmmasses and they talk of  wild unnatural types  liam could it /none/ just be talk for instance there is a rumor of a ghost girl on the docks back in  the menagerie coast we heard circulating  matt not too familiar with that one but its possible mind you im the navigator i aint  getting off the ship so thats all up to you  laura have you ever heard of the silver silt palace  matt cant say i have  laura okay just checking  travis caduceus are you excited about these haunted stories  taliesin i mean i guess i dont know i hadnt really thought about /town/ it  laura hey look it could be the path leading us to more dead people yeah  taliesin i guess i dont know im trying to reevaluate my expectations i suppose but we have  a direction we have a place to go and stories are stories  liam this thing that you want to do this mission im sorry i overheard last night is there a  place that it needs to happen or is it something that you will do wherever you go on the road  taliesin i didnt really think it through i hadnt really /none/ i thought it would be easier to  figure out  marisha caduceus do you actually even know what youre looking for  taliesin a sign  marisha so you came with us because we thought we were a sign  taliesin yeah  marisha and now youre looking for the next sign  taliesin well when you say it out loud  travis whereas he still hasnt found what hes looking for  matt yasha actually approaches from the side overhearing the conversation looks up to you  caduceus and goes i know what its like to be looking /none/ for some meaning some guidance  do you trust in your visions  taliesin i did i yeah  matt and you have strong faith in this thing you follow  taliesin yes  matt then if you ever go off the path maybe theyll tell you you just have to keep looking  taliesin well thats fair i hadnt really thought about that  matt its kind of new to myself as well  taliesin were heading towards an island ive heard stories lets go to the island  matt as you guys are  marisha when we fully /none/ get out of the reach of the land by the way as were sailing away i just  want to keep an eye out on the horizon and be like professor see if i see him  matt make a perception check  marisha i throw some dead pigeon or seagull in the air  travis never has there been a more worthless perception check  marisha nope seven  matt no sign of the professor you do have what is it sprinkle sprinkle is still nestled up next  to you however your blink puppy nugget still remains with /none/ marion back in nicodranas  laura i want to send a message to her before we go to sleep tonight  travis to nugget or your mom  laura to my mama  matt okay all right the evening comes quick by the time you guys are leaving its not that far  from dusk and so your first evening out on your new trajectory you have time what do you want to  send to marion  laura mama stuff happened at the docks and we had to leave very quickly please take care of  nugget for a /none/ while well be back i promise you may have heard about the little girl who was  killing herself on the dock  matt are you using this across multiple spells  laura yes this is my second message my second message that looked like me but it wasnt me  dont worry im very much alive and i love you very much and ill be home soon  liam beep  matt she doesnt have the chance to respond to the first one because you go right through to the  second but marion does respond to the second /none/ and goes oh well thank you for letting me know  jester be safe be bright and make me proud and come back soon you and your friends goodbye  all right whos keeping watch the first evening because now with a full crew you can go full  pace on this longship which will put you about 72 miles per day its about a 250 nautical mile  trip including through the reef with a full crew that means itll put you there in a little  over three days about three and a half maybe four days with /none/ careful passage through the reef  for the evening whos watch okay and you have crew who can take up as well if you want to so  one of you or both of you make a perception check  laura want both of us to do it  travis sure ten  laura 15  matt 15 okay during the evening you keep an eye on the waves at some point the moon itself  is starting to find itself low in the sky and you look over and you see this faint glow in the water  below /none/ you feel the back of your neck get warm for a second and you glance over to try and inspect  what the source of this light is its a jellyfish bloom you see hundreds and hundreds of these tiny  jellyfish below the surface that are giving this faint bioluminescent blues and pinks and variety  of colors in that pastel spectrum they pass under the waves as you move by and you look out beyond  that and you can see a few more for the next hour or so you look over the water and pass by /dung/ these  beautiful little beacons of color in the middle of this dark black ocean  laura fjord have you ever seen anything like this before  travis mmhmm  laura really  travis yeah theyre beautiful  laura yeah ive never seen anything like this  travis last thing you want to is jump in there though that is a bad time  laura really  travis yeah jellyfish sting and its quite painful  laura sometimes things that are the most beautiful are the things that can hurt you the  worst are you worried about where were /none/ going  travis no no im more anxious to get there my curiosity i suppose overrides my fear  laura thats good youre not afraid that this captain is going to hurt you  travis no i dont think i had gotten that far plus i have the sphere captain avantika doesnt  laura thats true  travis i feel like we take care of ourselves pretty well  laura yeah i promise ill heal you if you start to hurt okay  travis thank you  laura youre welcome do you ever get sad  travis sad  laura /none/ yeah that sometimes things dont work out the way you were hoping  travis yeah i suppose i get sad are you sad jester  laura only sometimes but it passes really quickly  travis im sometimes sad about the things that i had before that i wont have anymore i sometimes  wish that things were different what makes you sad  laura i miss my mama already i thought we could see her longer  travis i am sorry that we left in the way that we did would your mom ever think of leaving nicodranas  laura /none/ i dont know she thought about it one time with my dad she was planning to leave with him  but then he never came back  travis right what would you want for her to stay there and grow old or  laura i would like for her to be happy i would like for him to love her i dont know i would  like for her to not have to work anymore  travis thats very noble of you yeah  laura im pretty noble  travis well how about on some of these islands ive heard /none/ that there is treasure  laura oh really  travis hard to find im not making any promises but if we play our cards right and we take care of  each other we might return a bit wealthier than we left  laura this is a pretty good plan then we can use that money to bribe the gentleman to go back and  woo my mama again  travis or give it to your mom and have her go find the gentleman but shes just amazing  laura that could work too  travis yeah dont be sad /none/ your mom is very proud of you that much was clear  laura yeah thanks fjord  travis dont mention it  matt the remainder of the evening goes thankfully uneventful the blooms fade as you pass through  the evening mating grounds of these jellyfish the next day comes the morning comes and your first  true ontheocean breakfast kicks in thankfully because of supplies that were purchased there are  a number of fresh meats available a proper breakfast can be made you can see through the  crew that youve hired theyre quite surprised by the quality /none/ of food theyre given on this journey  theres a bit of like a damn now im glad i agreed to this journey they take some food and a  couple of them are like  travis they decided not to kill us  liam mutiny  taliesin there are vegetarian options as well  liam wow this quinoas pretty good  taliesin thats all i wanted i can die happy now  matt hilariously marius is actually a vegetarian  taliesin perfect  travis of course he is  matt he is hes like ill probably partake in that /none/ too if thats all right  taliesin no please  matt this is delicious  taliesin thank you im very proud of this family recipe  matt theyre crazy arent they  taliesin completely crazy bonkers  matt whats going to happen are they going to let me go you think  taliesin oh yeah i mean probably i dont know i mean im just barely attached on to this at  this point but i think youre fine  matt if worst comes to worst we cut and run huh you and me  taliesin worst comes to worst /none/ ill make sure you can cut and run i think im stuck here for a  while but ill make sure you can bugger out if you need to  matt okay thanks  taliesin yeah  matt once again very good  taliesin i have no idea what just happened  matt continuing on your journey whos keeping watch for this next day  marisha ill go  matt all right so either you guys roll individually or one of you with advantage your choice  marisha individually yeah  matt go for it  marisha perception  matt /none/ yeah  travis nice solid  marisha natural one  liam 17  matt 17 okay good  sam marisha you have to give 100 to 826la  laura oh my god can you imagine we would be so broke  sam every time we roll a one we have to donate 100 from our own wallets  matt okay since orly is the navigator helping you out and are you leading this are you guiding  the boat are you the captain of this  laura youre the captain just take it  matt you didnt hire a captain /none/ and they need to be hired by somebody so one of you needs to be  the captain  laura youre the captain captain fjord  matt you generally dont hire a captain for the ship like hey were just a bunch of assholes  with a boat we need to hire someone to be our leader and pay us  travis i saw right next to the cut your own keys booth next to the dock there was a  rentacaptain he would sit there with a corncob pipe and hes like argh me is a  taliesin you /none/ didnt download the app though didnt you so you didnt hire him  marisha yeah thats just a photo opportunity  matt whats your captain name to your crew  travis my captain name  matt they need to have to know who their captain is who theyre going to go towards  travis captain captain tusktooth  matt captain tusktooth there we go theyre very confused because there are no tusks visible on tusktooth  travis nope you never want to see them  matt good to know captain tusktooth all righty  liam the perception check was for /none/ at night during a shift  matt no this was throughout the day  liam all throughout the whole day okay  matt the crews keeping watch too but this is keen eyes and occasionally going up to climbing  the sail a bit to get a good view or climbing the mast to keep an eye out  marisha im leaning on the edge and i just go caleb this is boring its just blue  laura im blue  marisha jesters more interesting to look at  matt roll a survival check with advantage for orlys help as /none/ the navigator to keep us on task  and in the proper direction  liam could we say that beau and  travis natural 20  matt youre going to pick up some speed actually  liam look at fjord he is the captain now  matt captain tusktooth already out of the gate acting like a captain and the crews coming  together for all of you who watched the fuckery that was you trying to get out and then back to  port the night before seeing a full crew on the ship knowing what theyre doing youre /none/ like oh  yeah its probably good you hired this crew  travis lower the inboard motor fire at  liam one quick thing  matt yes  liam you know i want to thank you you could have told any of these people anything about me  and you have not  marisha no dont give me that much credit yet i still could  liam i know you have every right to i hope you dont i dont know how all of them would handle  it be that as it may i have something for you  /none/ marisha what  liam i bring frumpkin out in his new speckled elf owl form which is the smallest owl on the planet  he weighs one ounce  travis really one ounce  matt oh no  laura like the famous little owl with the star eyes  liam the tiniest little owl that ever existed this is a loaner  marisha oh my god  liam you can have him for roughly a week  marisha he doesnt look as angry as professor thaddeus  liam no this is the way owls are supposed to be i place /none/ him hes going to listen to you  marisha is he  liam yeah  marisha i poke him and see if he bites me  sam hes dead  matt every time  marisha everything that i touch  travis one ounce one inch punch  matt it is technically a monk weapon the index finger  marisha my hands are registered weapons  liam a couple rules he will listen to you will you listen frumpkin frumpkin nods okay if you  need to get him out of danger in a hurry you say split thats what it /none/ will take youll need  me to bring him back but if hes in danger and you want to keep him for your week loaner you say  split okay hes yours thank you yeah  marisha thanks caleb thank you  matt your guys day shift goes by keeping watch nothing really catches your attention its just  open shores and open waters since youre off the trade route path there dont appear to be any  other ships passing back and forth it feels comforting to be so alone in some ways but for  some of you /none/ its strangely isolating there may be a few moments throughout the next few days  where you have to go below deck and not conjecture you especially caduceus this is  taliesin im good in my head  matt day two and day three start getting a little hard on you to weve been traveling for 48 hours  and literally everything looks exactly the same  taliesin im going to start probably talking to fish at some point in the near future  matt okay for the evenings watch on the second day or this is technically the end /none/ of the first day  sam ill take a watch  taliesin ill take it  matt both of you guys roll for your perception  sam six nine  taliesin 15  matt 15 okay you continue on through the evening uneventful  sam want any booze oh you dont drink  taliesin i dont drink  sam mind if i drink  taliesin not at all  sam all right  taliesin out of idle curiosity why have you been trying to butter me up  sam well you joined us a little late in our adventures but /none/ many of us not me of course  but many of us were maybe outcasts or whatever before over the course of spending some time  together and traveling and doing some good things mostly good things but a few bad things together  weve come to rely on each other and well it doesnt feel like were outcasts as much anymore  just trying to maintain that sense of a unit because even though weve made some mistakes and  well probably continue to it feels like were a little bit better when were together this other  fellow /none/ in the group mollymauk he sort of showed us that by dying im just trying to keep us together  taliesin well  sam we all have our own things right im sure you have your own thing  taliesin i do and for the record im on board for now  sam thats good  taliesin ill keep your boy safe thats okay  sam thank you he will definitely need lots of healing on this island between you and me  jesters a really bad cleric so itd be good if you could just stick if i go /town/ right you go left  you stick with caleb  taliesin im not an only child im aware of how this works  sam okay you have sisters and brothers  taliesin oh yeah  sam oh thats right you told us you had a large family but theyre all scattered about right  taliesin theyre somewhere i suppose  sam are they trying to save your town is it a town is it your home  taliesin its just the temple ground thats all there is to it  sam theyre out there trying to find a solution for /none/ whatever ails it  taliesin thats why they left yeah that was the thought  sam youve had no contact with them  taliesin no i was the last one left  sam well i hope no one breaks in  taliesin well ive resigned myself to the thought that its entirely possible that someone will  sam im not a religious lady but i will tell you that for me this journey with this group has  been a bit of a sign i know that youre questioning whether it was for you but  taliesin what kind of /none/ sign  sam a sign that there could be for all of us another chapter  taliesin wow i thought i had you figured out never mind all right  sam im going to drink now  matt laughs finishing your watch uneventful as the evening comes in other folks can take a  shift or you can leave it to any of your crew you dont have to take every shift but you have  to rely on your crew to keep a watch  taliesin npcs  matt any plans for the evening  travis ill take the /none/ last watch is it at night at all  matt this would be night yeah youve been captaining the ship for a full day  taliesin before i go to sleep im going to politely ask any of the fish and things that are  in the ocean to let us know if theres trouble up ahead if they would be so kind  matt okay you get the sense that the fish would be happy to as they  taliesin im a lunatic arent i theres just no  matt no its great  taliesin okay because i have /none/ a roll for this but im okay  matt you lean over the side of the boat and talking to the fish that pass by you get the  sense that its like chorus of fish sure  laughter  travis you can talk to them but they cant talk back  matt theyre nowhere near as fast as the ship so within the sphere of perception that a fish has  the ones that are now far behind you will definitely let you know when you come across something  taliesin i dont know that  matt i know /none/ and i love playing that element  laura as a fish nice boat  travis ill hand off the wheel to someone and ill go down to the side of the ship and ill  summon the falchion  matt okay  travis with not a lot of people on the deck paying attention hopefully can i reach over the  side and dip the tip of the sword into the ocean  matt sure it drags through the water like any other blade would  travis does the eye do anything  matt no it doesnt react  travis /none/ okay ill summon it back  matt okay falchions back whence it came  travis quietly from whence it came  matt are you keeping watch  travis mmhmm  matt make a perception check for me  travis ooh seven  matt okay nothing for the evening okay as youre focusing on your blade on the side of the  boat as it gets close to midnight let me actually roll for the crew as well nope okay as  you are checking your blade and looking around you hear this sound that catches your ear its  like /dung/ rustling but its up glancing up to the left of your vision and theres a shape thats  sitting up on one of the sails  laura what the fuck what is it  matt just a dark shape sitting up there on the sail  travis professor thaddeus  matt its not moving  laura oh god  marisha and laura its so spooky  travis whistle ill sound a general alarm  matt as you whistle you see it has two wings and it and takes off into the dark night  sam what is it whats going /none/ on  travis there was something that took off from the mast it had wings  laura was it a parrot i hear theres parrots on pirate ships  travis it was pretty large right  matt it looked humanoidish  laura humanoidish  matt as far as sizewise it looked like a human you saw big wings and you saw legs dangling it  looked like a bird but it was humansized  marisha where is yasha i go down is yasha still sleeping or is yasha still here  matt yashas asleep you go down and yasha sits /none/ up as soon as you enter the room the chamber  that yasha has  marisha shouting yasha are you still here  matt before you even get to that point the sound of the door opening yashas like panting  marisha shouting yashas still here  matt be careful beau puts the blade and leans it against the side of the cot and leans back  marisha just wanted to give you a quick update fjord saw a thing with two wings appeared to be  humanoid flying off the boat and just wanted to make sure  matt /dung/ grabs the sword and gets back up and walks past you and up the stairs  marisha shouting yashas coming  laura what the fuck was it fjord  travis i dont know i didnt see its too dark  marisha im going to turn around and do a scan of the horizon do i see anything  matt perception check with disadvantage because this is looking into far darkness  marisha ill put my goggles on just in casies  matt just in casies sure but still at disadvantage  marisha nine eight  matt glancing out it looks /none/ like at this point the moon is just starting to vanish in the  distance so theres not a lot of light and it looks like a black endless void around the ship  with just a faint image of a blue line as a horizon in all directions  laura can i climb up to where it was and see if it left anything behind  matt sure  travis and sam like some poop  laura like poop or a feather or  matt you make your way up go ahead and make an investigation check  laura /none/ a wallet  marisha look personal identification  laura 12  matt you look and you can see its dry weathered wood this mast has been in use for a  while you do see what appear to be some grooves like large talons  laura it had claws  liam oh hey rub a little phosphorus on and send a globule of light 120 feet in every  direction from the boat four of them to see if theres anything  matt okay as the lights drift out at that moment you watch as a series of shapes swoop /none/ in  squawking in that instant you watch as a cluster of harpies not coming towards you are  now coming in and divebombing the sails theyre rushing in and trying to drag their claws through  to put you dead in the water from a narrative standpoint go ahead and roll initiative  marisha jesus  sam no oh no laura asks a good question  laura it was last campaign travis said  marisha heres my boots  matt all right 25 to 20  marisha sorry  sam oh do you want someone to roll for yasha /none/  matt oh yeah  liam mattll do it  matt yeah thats a 16  sam whoa best roll ever  marisha thats because ashleys not here to roll initiative for herself 20 for beau  taliesin are we doing 25 to 20 still  travis and laura yeah  liam weve been doing therapy talks for two and a half hours matt has to wake up now were on combat  matt all right 20

saying no in german excuse me i did not roll a nine  matt nott fjord and then caleb youre last  liam ja five  matt all right harpies rolled a natural 20 on their initiative roll  sam whoa  matt with their plus one thats a 21 so theyre going first you watch as six harpies come  swooping in two of them land up on top and getting a view of /none/ who alls on the ship the few  crew that are currently running the deck start shouting harpies and they start running  theyre not hired to fight and they go charging into the cabin below theyre both looking towards the  guys who are running and theyre both going to swoop down and see if they can go over to the deckhands  travis have they already slashed the sails  sam no not our crew  matt no not yet those two havent one of thems going to swoop down thats cocked no  not with a six /none/ manages to try and harry the guy and he kicks it off manages to push through the  other one dives down to grab a second one does manage to do so claws sink in not doing a whole  lot of damage but you watch as it grips into and begins lifting one of the deck hands hes three  or four feet off the ground and hes like yelling and the harpys lifting him up three  of the others are going to tear through the sails and one of them is about to land on the poop /none/ deck  on the back towards the stern of the ship the three are going to try to sweep across the sails  yeah thats a hit thats a hit  laura fucker  matt thats a miss one of them attempts to try and grab towards the sail but the way the wind is  blowing it cant actually get a hold of it and only does a slight tear on the side the other  two however with their claws seven 13 points of damage to that sail you hear the tearing sound  as they both drag /none/ a series of open tears across the central sail on the main mast you watch as  the sail flapping the ships starting to slow a little bit in that process the one that lands  in the back of the ship stops wings out inhales and this voice begins to emerge this strange  baleful singing this weird ghostly voice that seems to emanate and then grow into its own  chorus its like a dirge almost as it spreads out into the space i need everybody to make a  wisdom saving throw  sam ooh not my /none/ strength  marisha natural 20  matt great  travis 16  matt thats a success  liam 16  matt success  sam eight  matt fail  laura 24  matt success  taliesin 17  matt success roll for yasha if you dont mind one of you  sam 15 plus  matt everyone succeeds you hear this and you feel this weird faint grasp in your brain this  song beginning to placate your adrenaline but then you shrug it off except for nott nott you  are charmed by this harpy you listen to this /none/ music and its beautiful you find yourself all  the tension leaving your body and you cant focus on anything else youre just watching it there  you guys watch as notts arms drop her weapon going limp to her side her head turned slightly  towards one shoulder and smiling listening to this song one of the crew thats not currently  being held by the harpy almost makes it into the lower cabin and then stops dead in his grasp and  is also entranced by the song the harpy continues to sing all right beau youre up /none/ first  marisha with a quick glance does it look like the sail is worth trying to save any further or  is it fucked just with a quick glance  matt no the sail is not completely destroyed and it could be repaired should they not continue  to pull it apart  marisha they look like theyre still going for it  matt it looks like it  marisha okay im going to run over and try and collapse the sail so its not unfurled try and  collapse it i dont know if thats the right call /none/  matt you can give it a shot all right you have done a little bit of sail work id say make a  quick intelligence check having not been formally trained necessarily well see if you can  marisha 17  matt yeah in your time on the ship and studying how the different elements of the ship maneuver  together to create motion and riding the wind you figure out that one of the various ropes you pull  and release and will cause the sail to entirely come down or you could just pull it up and /none/ cause  it to no longer be unfurled  marisha whatevers quickest  matt probably pull it in you grab the rope and pull it up both the harpies are curving around  for another series of attacks on it but youre pulling that element of the sail up  marisha can i take a bonus action to do patient defense after i do that  matt you can your arm holds the rope in place and you get yourself ready in case anything  happens that finishes your go jester youre up  laura okay im going to cast /none/ spiritual weapon as my bonus action right above the singing harpy and  try to slam it down upon her head  matt go for it  laura what that i dont know  taliesin that was exciting  laura i feel like that shouldnt count but whatever that is a 12  matt 12 hits  laura oh good  matt theyre not very hard to hit they dont have a lot of armor if at all theyre more just  a little dexterous but other than that you see these harpy forms you see these humanoid female  /none/ lithe bodies naked but their legs curl into these taloned hawklike feet they have these  sets of wings that come off of it and their long stringy hair their faces are littleit goes  beautiful to grotesque where the mouth itself seem almost like the lips are shrunk and shriveled and  series of sharpened broken teeth are visible from where they open their mouth  laura 12 damage  matt 12 damage  laura then im going to use my action to  sam action surge  laura to cast toll the dead right over her head and /none/ ring a bell right across it  matt all right what is  laura wisdom saving throw of 15  matt natural one no  laura yeah thats 2d12  sam like sesame streets the count a two a d a 12 ah ah ah  laura seven points of damage ah ah ah  matt you see the impact of the spiritual weapon the large spinning lollipop cracking into her  face the song stops for a second and the blast of divine energy in the middle of her head sets  her off but she pushes through and /none/ continues the song looks pretty hurt and is wondering what to  do next that finishes your turn jester  laura yeah i guess im on the sail right im on the top  matt yeah youre up at the top looking down and the two harpies that are spinning back they  definitely noticed you casting these spells  laura can i hold on can i grab onto rope or anything or is that like an action  matt you can try to reach for something  laura could i consider my movement to like reach down and hold /none/ onto like  matt ill say you hold onto a rope sure thatll be your movement okay that finishes jesters  turn caduceus  taliesin first thing im going to do is im going to cast im going to get myself into a  reasonable position and im going to cast where did it go there it is calm emotions in theory  if this is a charm spell and this counts as a charm if im correct you can just fail a charisma  save if youd like  sam what how does this huh who  matt what /none/ are you attempting to do here  taliesin im going to use calm emotions to negate the charmed effect on nott and anybody within 20  feet of me actually anyone within 20 feet of it im going to run a few feet away from you  im going to take my staff and im going to pull piece of silverware and bang that crystal its  going to make a dissonant sound and wakeywakey  sam whoa  matt i will say because technically  taliesin charisma saving throw a creatures can choose to fail this saving throw if /none/ it wishes  matt well no there is no saving throw if theyre suppressing it so it just happens suddenly the  song thats entrancing you you shake out of it as caduceus finishes muttering this phrase and you  feel the clarity come to your mind once more  sam that was awesome  taliesin weve got work to do  sam okay  matt this also affects the other deckhands  taliesin yeah so im just basically disrupting that song as long as its within a certain range  for about a minute im also going to use /none/ my bonus action to wake up the bugs  matt the mass of winged beetles begin to clatter out in a cloud  taliesin the one thats singing im going to roll it towards the lollipop  matt okay they rush in there  taliesin snack time  matt go ahead and make an attack its a d20  taliesin 17  matt yeah thatll definitely hit that is 2d  taliesin i got to fix this at some point  matt yeah ill make a print out remind me to make a print out for you since this is /none/ having a hard time  taliesin i know we just havent had time to fix anything  matt i know  sam why not  matt yeah it is 4d4  taliesin thats right thats ooh 15 points of damage  matt 15 points of damage  laura beetle damage  taliesin i dont even know what just happened  marisha caduceus is back  matt okay the beetles are now swarming this harpy whos taken bludgeoning it is now bleeding  profusely and you can only see part of her torso and shes like screeching the song is dropped /none/  and now is trying to fly away as shes picking up her wings as these beetles are now tearing into  her flesh that ends your turn caduceus  taliesin yep  matt yashas turn theres the two that are up on top darting down to pick up the guy the one  thats currently holding the other deckhand yashas going to rush forward since its  technically within her melee range shes going to rush forward and take two strikes if someone  wants to roll for her  sam i will  matt go for it  /none/ sam nope thats not a d20 a ten and a one  matt all righty the ten hits the one does not  sam great  liam im sure some stuff was added to the ten  matt all right no its 3d6 actually  laura i want to do that  matt go for it  taliesin yeah teamwork  laura oh six  sam my rolls were better  laura your rolls wouldve been better  matt great okay  laura you rolled a one on your hit we both suck  matt yasha carves through a large /none/ chunk of it the harpy still holds onto the deckhand but is  unable to make a drop this brings us to nott and fjord  sam is anyone in melee range with anyone else  matt currently there is the one holding the deckhand that yasha just attacked  sam im going to shoot at that one  matt go for it  sam okay 15  matt that hits  sam sneak attack  matt theyre not very armored or dexterous creatures  sam 18 points of damage  matt 18 points of damage nice blasts you see /none/ it has to right itself shes flapping her wings  but still holding on and trying now desperately to just get away theres no attempt to interface  she has her quarry and is about to bolt  sam fire again bonus action  marisha kill it  sam oh not good 11  matt 11 just hits  laura 11 hits  sam hits whoa no sneak attack eight points of damage  matt eight points of damage yeah thatll do it as its flying away it gets about ten or so feet  up and the deckhand is /none/ screaming ah help me  sam ive got you nameless deckhand  matt the bolt hits it spins in the air a cluster of feathers then slams down hard on the  deck of the ship the deckhand also hits and rolls and hits the side of the ladder that leads  up to the poop deck hes like groaning and now starting to freak out looking at the other harpies  that are circling theres still five of them  sam ill use my movement to run over to the deckhand and be like youre okay now  matt /none/ ah  sam youre fine  matt all right fjord  travis ill aim two eldritch blasts up at one of the two harpies thats flying up above the mast  matt okay  travis 19 on the first one  matt that hits  travis and the second one is ooh 25  matt both hit  travis that is oh shit where is the 1d10 ten  matt ten points of damage on the first one  travis nope no sorry i was calling that out like an idiot 11 points of damage on the first  one /none/ and seven points of damage on the second one  matt all right you turn around glancing up at them release that one blast of eldritch energy  that crackles and spins slamming into each of them up in the air and lights up the sky above  the mast you can see through the diffusing of the impacts behind the sails on the opposite side of  the deck for those of you on the other end of the ship as both of them spin into a circle taking  pain from the impact but then right themselves looking /none/ down to the source of this angry  aggressive act  travis thats it  matt all right that brings us to caleb  liam how far up the mast could you say i could climb with my movement is that half speed  matt with your movement it would be half speed and id say for you whos not a necessarily an  accomplished climber it would be an athletics check  liam okay  laura necessarily an accomplished climber  taliesin indoor kid  liam how high does the mast go  matt the mast would go up /none/ probably 25 30 feet  liam nevermind i will stand at the mast and i will pull a white feather out of my coat and trace  a baleful glyph in the air and cast fear and they must make a wisdom saving at 16  matt both of them  liam anything within 30 feet of caleb  matt anything within 30 feet of caleb  sam anything  liam enemies  sam oh okay  matt that would get three of them the one that failed to grab the other guy is just out of range  travis /none/ theres only three left right  matt theres five left technically  travis i thought there were only five  sam there were six  matt there were six total ones died one of thems close to death and there are two wounded  and two that have been untouched  travis oh the song broke it didnt die  liam 16 wisdom save  matt thats a failure thats a failure and thats a success the one that had missed one of  the deckhands and is on an upswoop doesnt seem affected the two by the mast immediately /dung/ as the  glyph completes and theres this very subtle burst of dark dullgreen shadow energy that  emanates from you both of them shrieking and are going to start getting the fuck out of dodge  all right that ends your turn caleb  liam yeah thats it  matt back to the top of the round harpies those two harpies full dash full run go spinning back  in the direction they came as far away from you as they can get  liam auf wiedersehen  matt those two for the time being are out of the /none/ way lets see if they can make their save nope  liam they have to be out of line of sight if they can see theres me on the boat  matt thats true yeah  liam thats what the spell says  matt yeah facing away doesnt matter yeah no theyre still running  liam see ya  matt okay theres the one on the back thats near death its going to attempt to fly away as  well its going to move and dash thats 80 feet out and its trying to catch up with the other  /none/ two now theres three of them fleeing that one that one and that one all right the two that  are attacking theres two that are attacking the mast one picked him one one thats singing i  know im trying to remember where it is okay yeah there we go theres the one that tried to  grab the one deckhand its going to swoop down and try and grab him again because he hasnt made  his way fully in does manage to grab him swoops down only gets partial only 15 feet up with him  thats /none/ its turn lets see the other two are going to go ahead two are fleeing thats  fleeing oh theres only one thats free that one is going to attempt to attack one of the other  sails because theres multiple sails up at that point a smaller one you know what no its  going to come after you since youre the one thats holding the sail its going to swoop down  and attack you with claws  marisha come at me bitch  matt that is a actually surprising an 18  marisha miss  matt i /none/ think that misses you oh its at disadvantage too because you have your  marisha patient defense  matt yes second attack yeah misses with both  liam you motherfucker  matt its going to attempt to move 15 feet away from you with the rest of its movement  marisha pop  matt go for it make an attack  sam punch attack  travis didnt we say we werent going to try and solve things with fists  sam yeah lets talk it out  marisha its all i have  travis cawing  marisha 13 i believe /none/ that hits  matt yeah that hits  marisha this is unarmed ooh ten total  matt all righty  liam max damage  matt and it cannot move its less of a punch but more of like with your open hand you grab the back  her leg and slam the harpy on the edge of the boat it gets dragged down and thrust down on the edge  of the railing and crack a rib and its trying to get out of your grasp and it manages to pull free  but now is right there next to /none/ you couldnt get much further you get the sense now that theyre  retreating this was a quick harrying they didnt expect quite so much resistance and most of  them are wanting to get the hell out with that knowledge beau its your turn  marisha okay im going to use the rope that im holding onto and im going to use that to lift  myself up and do like a little swinging doublekick action to this harpy  matt i love it go ahead and make your two attacks  marisha little cirque du soleil shit both /none/ hit thats a 16 and a 19  matt thats correct go ahead and roll damage for each  liam bop bop  marisha pop pop for both of them  travis yeah  liam yeah high rolls  marisha eight plus five is 13 plus another six is 19  sam oof  matt 19 points of damage both kicks whack whack to the harpy as shes trying to get back up  on the air ends up knocking her back onto the deck angry crowing  marisha still up  matt still up and is now is going /none/ to continue to try and make an escape  marisha im going to take the rope and wrap it around my fist once and pop with my bonus  action no flurry of blows two attacks pop pop  liam come on beauregard  marisha let me roll for two attacks okay that is 14 for one and a natural 19 for the other  matt yeah roll damage  marisha ten damage  matt ten damage total  marisha yep  matt with the next hit you go ahead and just punch past the face and then with the /none/ other hand  you wrap the rope around her throat then release you watch the tension of the sail as it unfurls  and snaps the neck of the harpy and drags her up and is now dangling from the rope as the sail is  now unfurled again still torn  travis did you do that on purpose  sam wind physics  marisha it was better results than i expected  laura always say yes  marisha yes  matt that finishes up beaus turn jester youre up  laura okay im going to use my spiritual weapon /none/ to send it to the harpy that is trying to get that  guy off the ground  matt okay go for it  laura nine plus seven it hits  matt yes roll damage  laura eight points of damage to him  matt that was the first time that its been wounded it gets hit by the large spiritual  lollipop as its trying to carry off the deckhand still holding on  laura i think im going to use guiding bolt on the one that was flying away that was singing  matt okay go for it /none/ its quite a ways away and you can see it flapping  laura i get 120 feet  matt yeah definitely within 120 feet so go ahead and roll for the attack on that  laura okay okay okay  matt level one  laura yes level one  matt it looks pretty hurt  laura i dont know what i add to it  taliesin it should be right above  laura its an 18 i get 18 plus whatever  matt yeah its your spell attack bonus the same as your spiritual weapon  laura oh okay plus /none/ seven its good  matt 4d6  laura oh come on seven points of damage  matt seven points of damage as you bring the spiritual weapon down you turn to see the other  one flying away you release the bolt of vibrant radiant energy it streaks off right as its  flying heading it off you quickly aim watching its arc and as it flies away impact  screeching you watch this burst of light as its body tumbles and sploosh into the ocean water  below jester that finishes your turn caduceus youre up  taliesin sure /none/ yeah theres one thats trying to get away with one of our deckhands  matt correct its been hit once  taliesin okay im just going to nuts and bolts this i dont suppose my insect swarm can attack  for a bonus action  matt it cant get close enough unfortunately  taliesin well then  matt yeah the other harpy pulled away from it it can move closer but its not going to  taliesin i guess ill do a guiding bolt at level three  matt okay  taliesin i just saw you that im like ah /none/  matt all right  taliesin yeah thats 19 so thats 6d6  laura damn  travis shit  matt caduceus looking at the swarm turns around holds the staff in the air towards the one  taking off with one of your deckhands and when you saw the bright beam  taliesin 16 points of damage  matt ooh spins around and releases a far heavier and brighter burst of light that streaks into and  blasts into the harpy wobbles in the air for a second the energy explodes and is now spinning  keeping this weird shifting /none/ like an atom spin around the outside of its body the next attack  has advantage because of guiding bolt its looking pretty hurt too  laura show off  matt that finishes caduceuss round  sam is it carrying our deckhand over open water now  laura not yet  matt no not yet  sam okay  matt yashas turn yasha it just grabbed him and is trying to pull away yashas i dont  think yashas close enough to hit and melee it it pulled him up too high  travis throw the sword no  matt /none/ yeah shes not going to do that  travis fuck  matt yeah thats not happening theres not much yasha can do right now  laura can she jump and swing  matt not really sorry yashas going to get underneath though and prepare in case it does get  knocked down a peg or whatever just gets the sword at the ready and is eyeballing it angrily  and is going to rage because thats fun all right that brings us to nott and fjord  sam i will fire at the thing with my crossbows  matt you /none/ do have disadvantage though because its out of your firing range although you can  probably move up closer and get within range its up to you you can do that  marisha the deckhand one  sam yeah theres only one left right no maybe  taliesin i think so yeah  laura yeah theres one left  sam i only rolled an 11  taliesin but you also have advantage because its got guiding bolt  matt yes  sam oh that helps  matt 11 does hit but  sam oh well thats even better 17 to /none/ hit  matt go ahead and roll damage  sam sneak attack because its no its holding the friend  matt not technically  its holding yeah and its not even an ally whos in combat with it so  sam its an employee seven points of damage  matt seven points of damage all right arrow sound still flying  sam ill shoot again one more time  marisha come on come on  sam 18 to hit  matt yeah  sam only eight more points of damage  marisha thats pretty good  matt thatll do it /none/  cheering  matt and all out of hit points so arrow sound the second one you watch as it goes pained  sounds and it begins to just careen down towards the edge of the ship  sam oh no  matt its about to slam well see theres a percentage chance here  sam ooh percentage dice  matt im going to roll a percentile dice to see if it hits either on the deck or over the edge  no it hits on the deck  sam oh nice  matt 50 chance of either it crashes /none/ in to the other guy slams in to the side of the railing  manages to pull free and catches up with the other guy as they both run inside the ship at this  point the other harpies now are just  travis bugging out  matt bugging out and fleeing  marisha threats are all gone more or less  matt at the moment by the time your spell would wear off there are none to be seen  laura can i hang from my rope that i was holding on to and slowly start casting mending on /none/ the sail  matt sure  travis oh smart  liam caleb clutches his chest and cries out and falls to the floor of the boat gasping  sam oh no its his condition  laura shouting whats wrong with caleb  sam its a heart condition  travis since when  sam he always has had one since he was a boy  travis do you have any medicine for him  sam yes he needs mouth to mouth resuscitation  travis well get at it  sam no no no my mouth is too small for a human /none/ jaw to make perfect contact  travis just cup his nose just breathes  sam no i cant get my mouth wide enough too many teeth are in the way  laura ill do it  sam that would be good you or beau really  laura i drop down i have like really good medicine training  sam all right  laura exhaling heavily  matt okay well caleb just for the sake of it roll a deception check  liam ja sure  travis ja sure  matt just out of curiosity  liam its pretty good 20 /none/  travis caleb always pretending hes hurt  matt caleb is having a rough  a terrible  yeah all right so just so

woods i think we all need to pray  liam strained thats not what i was expecting  laura oh good youre alive  travis do you want to lead /none/ the prayer  sam yes  liam oh thank goodness you know im such a fearful person  sam oh maybe hes okay  liam im always getting scared of things and that one was too much for me  travis he could be on the edge of life and maybe the prayer  laura i start climbing back up  marisha glad youre not dead again buddy  liam i look over at nott  sam wow you guys we saved his life with the power of friendship  travis was that i thought it was jesters healing  /none/ sam yeah but we all were there to pitch in  travis i just watched  liam caleb is beet red beet red face matches his hair  taliesin i dont understand anything that just  travis how do we prevent further heart episodes from  sam more friendship just more friendship  travis more friendship  liam no we just need to not be attacked by anything anymore we need to just stop pursuing  our pursuits and pick an island and stay there  marisha are you saying you want to retire from adventuring life caleb  travis /none/ beau go give caleb a hug  liam i feel pretty good i feel like  marisha youre so why are you so stiff  travis like a voldemort hug  liam this is feeling like its going too far nott  sam hisses its working  marisha weve only done this once before caleb its still weird i just want to point that out  okay let go of me get off yeah  liam is it hot feels hot  laura whispers 12  matt no sign of any harpies  travis hows that sail coming jester  /none/ laura im working on it  matt it takes a short time but you manage to in the next ten minutes or so feel comfortable that  youve mended most of what the harpies had done  taliesin im going to go down and let the crew know that everything seems to be copacetic upstairs  matt the two crew that you hired who already rushed in there are in the process of telling  the story of what they just saw theyre like and then there was a blasting light up there  it was crazy  taliesin hey /none/ everything seems to have calmed down upstairs everything seems fine i think im  going to try blintzes for breakfast tomorrow i feel like we could all use a treat  matt you notice half of them go yeah  taliesin they dont know what im making them out of but yeah  matt no and the other half are like blintzes  travis are we putting limits on your cuisine taliesin  taliesin not anymore i now have the song every little piece from petes dragon going through my head  sam theres a harpy dead on deck right /none/  matt two of them  sam im going to definitely butcher one of them and try to take some meat for myself and for the crew  matt go ahead and make a general medicine check  sam oh my goodness  matt ill say with disadvantage because youre not too familiar with the body of a harpy  sam eight  matt you butcher it thats a gameyass harpy you do get some meat to you it looks delicious  but everyone else youre like im good you get like a pound  sam i want some wing /none/  matt okay  sam maybe they can deep fry it  matt its pretty sinewy  taliesin do we have an empty barrel  laura i bought a couple barrels  matt you guys bought a number of barrels you filled a lot of them  taliesin whatever is left over if you could put in there and im going to start something and  hopefully something  sam like a stock  marisha he wants his dead people tea  taliesin i dont know what im going to get ive never tried harpy before it could be mushrooms /none/  could be anything  travis start something  liam some bone broth maybe  taliesin im

rolled for him last week and he appropriately only has one hit point  matt good to keep that in mind as you bring your things in for the evening that comes to a close  your second full day of travel now the following morning comes to bear whos keeping watch for  this day  taliesin sure ill take that  matt make a perception check for me please  taliesin ooh thats terrible 13  matt 13 okay for the day you dont see anything you do no you dont see anything  /none/ okay ocean all wide ocean  travis are you listening underneath the boat using your sonar  matt yeah what are you doing with your barrel  taliesin i just was going to put anything that was dead now and i was just going to see if i  could maybe start either i dont know what theyre going to make but im curious if its  going to be anything i can either eat or use as a spice  matt okay so you just begin to decompose  taliesin im using the decompose and ferment and maybe hopefully /none/ getting some mushrooms or  something i dont know what harpies make well find out  matt youll find out itll be a little while you watch as the start of various fungus and fuzzy  mold begins to appear at edges of its corpse youve started it a couple days maybe youll  have something that will give you an idea what is growing  taliesin yeah if its good i keep it if its bad i toss it  matt next evening all right go ahead and make a perception check  travis i dont know why i /none/ keep volunteering for fucking perception 14  matt 14 okay make your survival check for me as the captain please with advantage because you  have orly on board  travis 12  matt thats successful youre not picking up any additional speed like you were the day before  okay uneventful at one point you pass by a few small rock islands bits of stone that are  breaking through the surface too far away to make any details theyre not large one set appears to  be maybe ten 12 feet across the other one looks to be /none/ about 40 or so feet across just little  breaks in the water where a little mass of stone has breached but thats all you can make out the  evening goes by uneventful by the third day the morning comes around orly comes up to the top  comes to you and goes excuse me captain im keeping tabs on our travels southward i can see  the reef is approaching  travis excellent laughter well lets prepare to navigate through it  taliesin such captaining  travis i just picked it as a backstory i didnt know id /none/ need to know fucking anything about sailing jesus  sam someone get travis a subscription to sailing monthly or something  matt there are different see those y marks each one of those is going to be a survival check  to try and maneuver the boat through the reef  laura do we get advantages on those or something  matt yes because you have orly with you and orly is working with you side by side holding up  the map and looking at the scenery a lot of the crews on the deck as well keeping eyes /none/ out  liam and sam the dodecahedron  laura oh yeah yeah focus on this fjord  liam take a huff  matt you have your fragment of possibility  travis these are survival checks  matt yes with advantage for the first one  travis 16  matt you guys can now see at first it just looks like open water but then as you begin to  maneuver past the first section looking down 20 feet 15 feet ten feet some of them barely  breaching the surface you can see these colorful reefs that are full of /none/ vibrant life all sorts of  manner of sea creatures and fish going through and within a very short distance you can see  broken wood you can see other ships the remnants of which have been scattered across the reef and  have since been overgrown carefully making your way through this gap you manage to curve slightly  one bit the back of your stern scrapes at one point on one edge but any damage would be  superficial and you manage to maneuver past where you can see one set of sticks that have been tied  /none/ together and embedded into the reef just below just barely peeking past breaking the surface  and thats the first sign you see of one of those points  liam pirate voice dead men tell no tales  matt now that youve seen it thats going to be your guiding point for each portion of this reef  you and orly both going through and traversing this you can see the next path before you both  of you together go ahead and make another survival check with advantage  travis got to use the dodeca  matt all right /none/ roll one more you only roll one more so pick one and roll it  travis thats a ten  matt total is a ten  travis survival is minus two for me  sam minus two youre our fucking captain  travis not very wise  matt all right then as you make your way through the next portion of the reef turning it over you  hear it impact a heavy portion of the reef scraping across it the ships hull does take damage  laura gallan go go fix it  matt okay that is 11 points /none/ of hull damage eventually pulls past and dislodges from the  matt reef looking behind you can see parts of it that are broken and falling in and pieces of wood  that have been dragged off and splintered the crew rushes down inside and making an investigation  check pretty high they do not see any damage to the hull thats taking on water but that was  not a happy thing you do not know how many more of those type of hits youll take before the ship  begins to take on water and they cant do /none/ repairs to the hull unless its in a port of some kind  travis theres not a hit point counter on the wheel thats ticky tock  laura im going to stay down where it was and cast mending as much as possible  matt you have no visual perspective on it all the damage is below the surface of the water  laura oh yeah at all im just going to keep my hands on the  matt just in case okay  laura yeah  matt keeping low all right so thats the second one youre marking each /none/ of these  that you pass by  travis yeah one and two were on the third  matt were on the third  marisha come on  matt go ahead and try again now  travis natural 20  matt okay the channel youve made your way through in the reef is getting narrower and you  can see elements of the reef are beginning to vanish into just jutting pieces of stone it looks  like in a weird way from a distance like a series of gravestones familiar to you as you pass  by as bits /none/ of rock are breaking the surface some at odd angles and there were semblances of stone  spires that naturally jut from underneath the water that the reef is built on over time the  channel gets thinner here but thankfully after that last hit you dig deep in yourself and be  like no ive seen ships go through this im getting the feel for this whole captain thing  and between you and orly communicating you manage to just make it through the channel at a point  all of you hold your breath as you see elements /none/ of the reef that should be wide enough to put maybe a  ship thats slightly larger than the one you have in but with even just a small narrow margin of  failure here you wouldve ground against the side of one or the other side you cut straight through  perfectly balancing on both sides coming past the third marker beneath the surface this one  breaking through about a foot past the water as you spin around you guys begin to just barely see  the shadowed landmass of an island beginning to appear as your destination /none/ as you come to the  final portion of the reefs channel go ahead and make your final check  laura come on tusktooth  travis 13  matt 13 you come through the last portion of this its a very tight location and you and orly  look back and forth you may have been a little off in the portion of the reef you thought you  were supposed to take through this broken channel and as you do it seems fine and youre looking  at the front of the ship a bunch of them gathered at /none/ the bow and look over both on port and  starboard side and go i think well be all right crashing  sam oh no  matt grinds over a portion of the reef the ship jolts it wasnt a hard hit youre just grinding  over the top of it and youre breaking a lot of the reef right there in the process of doing so  you dont take as much damage as the last hit but you do take some damage thats a bad roll you  take nine more hull damage with that jester whooshing water /none/ begins to pour in from the side  this is less of just mending a small object this is structural hull damage  laura gallan gallan come on carpenter  sam gallan wake up  matt a single break or tear in an object you touch mending is not going to help you with this  laura no  matt gallan and anybody who wants to come help the hull is now taking on water  laura yeah i want to help block it  matt okay what are you doing to help block it  laura im going to /none/  matt its essentially a one oneandahalf foot long break and the wood is torn away its broken  apart and theres a gap where the waters now pouring in  laura is there any furniture i can rip apart and we can nail to it real fast  matt make a perception check real fast as you glance around the chamber  laura that dropped out of my hand it shouldnt count aw it was so much better when it didnt nine  sam oh rough  matt looking around theres some of the barrels and in the various /none/ quarters of the interior of the  ship theres some cots and theres some sacks and whatever supplies people brought with them  nothing comes to mind looking around youre kind of panicking all the rest of the crew are  suddenly coming down theyre starting to get a bucket chain trying to just get water out of  there as they have no idea at the moment gallan gets his tools starts looking around for whatever  scrap materials they had purchased youre now an inch of water in the bottom of the ship anyone  else doing anything /none/ to help here  sam some barrels come on captain tell us what to do  travis i have no idea  sam youre the fucking captain  travis abandon ship  sam no  laura can i use one of the barrels and start scooping the water into the barrel and lift the  barrel up and out and try to carry it  marisha me and yasha help with the barreltrain  matt you guys are slowing the water coming on board  sam oh caleb youre a wizard freeze the water  liam i am not able /none/ to do that  sam ah  laura can we take the barrel that i was holding the water in and stick it over the hole and then  hold it  matt you can certainly try  marisha i miss my druid  matt yeah yasha goes and grabs the other side of the barrel and both of you go try and force and  hold it there  liam i start working on leomunds tiny hut its going to take some time  matt all right how much time  liam ten minutes 11 minutes yeah  matt /none/ i need you to go ahead and make a strength check with yashas help with advantage  laura okay goddamn it really 12  matt 12 you hold the barrel over and it seals bursting water youre holding it there but its  spraying around the edges the barrel immediately fills and youre now trying to cork the hole with  this barrel and its just spraying sounds all around you  sam fjord go swim down on the outside and plug it from the outside go  marisha with what  sam bring something  marisha what  sam /none/ some pieces of wood  taliesin do we have a mattress or something like that do we have anything  matt theyre less mattresses in the ship there are cots there is actually a mattress in the  captains quarters theres the one mattress  travis sure ill drag that out and jump over the side and try and push up against the hole  marisha its fabric  matt is that what youre doing  travis yeah  taliesin im going to join you and tie ourselves off and im going to also cast water walk if  youre /none/ into it on  travis im thrilled we can still go underwater though right  matt yeah and you can walk on the surface if you choose to  taliesin im going to give you water walk for the moment because youre probably stronger than i am  i should probably not do this  marisha ill go up there and hold that safety line that you were talking about  taliesin youve got water walk  travis i throw the mattress in i jump in after it and i try and go under  matt you can stand on /none/ the surface and then below  taliesin theres a suction  matt you get below and you get the mattress what do you do  travis i press it against the outside of the ship and hope the current suctioning  matt okay make a perception check because its under the water and youre not entirely certain  where theres a large scrape section where a lot of the reef pulled against the hull  travis 20  matt 20 yeah glancing down as youre about to go help you look and you can see of all the  damage /none/ thats taken thats superficial theres one section where it looks like a heavy groove is  carved out from that last impact and there you can see this faint shift of the water pouring  through that gap you take and hold down the mattress and it pulls against it its there in  place the suctions holding it youre not sure how long itll hold there without anything holding  it in place  taliesin im going to run down below and all right fix it fix it now got to get it up i  start trying to /none/ pull the barrels apart  matt gallan at this point has his tools and starts handing out nails left and right he  brought an additional set of tools so two of you can  taliesin im also going to cast light in there to make it super super light  matt while youre brightening that gallans over there hes hammering in the nails  laura ill help  matt two barrels down pulled apart to get materials to try and patch this  marisha im still part of the water bucket brigade  liam correction for me not 11 /none/ minutes 20 minutes still doing it  sam im on the top of the crows nest is that what its called  matt crows nest is the very top  sam as far away from the water as possible  matt okay looking good  sam yeah  matt all right great youre there because the ship is still moving youre having to hold it in  place while walking on the side it seems to be holding itself okay for the time being just from  the pressure of the water but its starting to slide off as it /none/ goes its a weird scenario where  now that its blocking the section theres no suction theres just the pressure of the water  but as it moves it is sliding along with it  travis ill take the sword shove it no im just kidding  matt all right jester youre helping out with the repairs make a general d20 check  laura two  matt and marisha aw  matt i lost that d20 ill pick that up later oh natural 20 on gallans turn if you needed  that any time its fucking now  laura ooh /town/ gallan  matt gallan sees you mucking up grunting let me do it hold on heres how you place it over  fuck it shit he does it himself he goes to town and earns his keep since he arrived here  one by one begins taking the best parts of the barrel that yasha helped him break begins holding  it in place hold this here he starts nailing it down eventually over the 20 or so minutes it  takes for him to cast the spell he patches it in a way where hes like scottish accent this /none/ will  hold for a little bit but were going to have whyd i go scottish there for a second  this will hold for a little bit i dont know how long were going to have to figure out some way  to fix this get it to shore or something  travis yeah  laura yes of course  matt sighs okay  travis i say from outside the boat yeah  matt as youre walking alongside the boat its going to pick up speed a little bit here youre  going to have to either have to /none/ let this mattress go or find a way to keep it in place what are you  going to do  travis ill let it go  matt okay the mattress slides away and you see water spraying its a slow leak it is still  taking on water but slowly  laura okay  matt its a patch job when caleb returns he can tell us what the fuck he was planning with the spell  travis ill tug on the line and get myself pulled back up into that boat  sam were taking on water  travis /none/ yeah  sam oh god we have to anything nonessential just throw overboard  laura no no no  travis we got to get the crows nest out of the boat  sam no everything overboard everything the sails everything  matt the crew now rapidly getting the water out of the bottom of the cargo hold theyre throwing  it overboard you gather with the slow leak in the next couple hours theyll be able to minimize  the amount of water thats below there  laura okay  marisha does it look like theres a little island nearby /none/  travis yes weve done the final turn so we could try and push towards the island but were  going to have to beach it  matt you guys are now turning towards the island and its an open bay now you passed the reef and  youre heading towards the island of urukayxl  taliesin is there anywhere that looks like a dock or anywhere that looks like its appropriate to  matt make a perception check  taliesin yeah i am i think thats right 26  matt 26 no dock but you do see another ship /none/  sam ah  travis whats your spell do  laura what was your spell doing  liam im making the tiny hut but i dont know how much time has passed while i was peeing  matt 20 minutes as theyve try to makeshift plug the hole its a slow leak still but theyve  managed to hold it off  liam a tenfoot radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and  remains stationary for the duration environment or weather cant get in so thats up to you if  the ocean can /none/ get in or not  matt i would say you know what thats clever i will say if you choose not to let the ocean in  it will not  laura yay  liam it is totally transparent all of us can look through it and see into the ocean  sam and liam glass bottom boat  matt there you go  laura how long will it stay  liam eight hours  laura nice long enough for us to patch it up  liam i can certainly 20 minutes in advance get it going again as long /none/ as i can focus indefinitely  travis weve approached the island we have another boat  taliesin how do you want to play this  travis what  taliesin thats another boat are we making ourselves known or are we not making  ourselves known  laura off to the side park it away from the other boat  travis but i think its daytime right  matt it is yeah  travis if we can see them they can see us  taliesin how far away is the other boat  matt id say its  taliesin is it /none/ possible they havent seen us yet  matt theyre about maybe as youre breaking past the reef theyre a few miles away  taliesin would it be reasonable to think theyve seen us by this point  matt its possible if you can see them with your naked eye theres a chance theyve seen you but  you dont know you have no way to confirm that  marisha does it look like theyre coming or going from that island  matt you just noticed them you dont see any motion yet youd probably have to try and  gauge /none/ it over a period of time  travis i will try to increase our speed towards the island in the direction away from them and  aim to get on the island if we can  taliesin all right  matt you are covering that youve given that information to orly and hes like all right  ill keep to that way there he begins to lead you in that direction you move the ship that way  keeping watch as youre shifting around are you going south or north side youre heading south  towards the island as you /none/ went through the reefs so now youre on the northwestern  side of the island  travis it just depends on where the ship was if it was directly ahead of us or towards the north  or the south wed obviously go the opposite way  matt okay its a little bit north of where youre headed  travis were going to the southern tip  matt youre cruising and youre keeping an eye closely you watch as the ship was stationary  begins to move in the direction youre traveling  sam oh no  travis were going /none/ to ground this ship were going straight into the beach and were going to  run our asses into the fucking jungle  sam how will we get back  travis i dont know were not there yet  sam you are a terrible captain  travis i throw nott overboard full sail  matt all right  travis i grab her and bring her back no im just kidding  marisha you know that video of the monkeys throwing the raccoon  travis oh yeah  marisha thats what i imagined  matt in pushing the ship ahead as /none/ fast as you can with the hole plugged towards the south side of the  island in the attempt to beach it as you continue the ship is moving to head you off at the pass  travis mmhmm  matt eventually you start getting a closer look at it and its a bigger ship than the one you  have now its dual mast  travis yep does it have some trap doors on the side of the  matt well make a perception check  travis yeah 16  matt you look and you dont see any and /none/ then you do because one of them opens you watch as one of  the gun ports popping  taliesin im going to raise the flag  travis yeah why not  sam what flag do we have  liam the white flag  taliesin the blue flag  travis weve got the gray wave one  matt okay as you get situated you hear cannon explosion water splashing but a ways away  sam its a warning shot  matt yeah it is a warning shot  travis uhhuh  sam raise the flag  taliesin i rose it /none/ its been risen it is risen  travis i use mask of many faces to make myself look like captain jawgrasp you lower the flag  and hmm fuck i dont know jesus christ  taliesin its tough being the smart one eh  liam yeah no more grog  taliesin be bold  travis yeah fuck it were going to beach the ship were just going to keep driving towards the island  matt youre going to keep going  travis yep  liam excitedly yeah  travis how far are we thats another question  matt oh youre /none/ probably at this point about a mile and a half two miles  travis oh no no nevermind no well slow down the ship a little  matt yeah its quite a distance from the island you notice it as you go to move its quite a ways  travis okay yeah well lower the flags slow the ship  matt okay you slow the ship do you come to a stop  travis mmhmm  matt all right the ship you bring it slowly down do you drop anchor  sam caleb i want to talk about mutiny  /none/ matt as youre watching off to the side you can see all the gun ports are open now but you see  two smaller boats that are now coming towards you from the other ship you can see two separate  small crews that are rowing in your direction  travis cool lets lower the rope ladder over the side and welcome them aboard  taliesin you could technically stand and offer i might add since you can actually stand on water  travis i can what  taliesin you can stand on water right now  travis oh i /none/ dont know if he did that so lets not  matt the other ship has maneuvered up to the point where it is now its full starboard side is  facing you full gun ports open youre in a bad position  travis yep  marisha is there anything in the sails any flags iconography  matt make a perception check  marisha my perception checks have been garbage six  matt there is one sail that is currently partially unfurled but from this distance it  looks like its facing away from you from the direction youre looking so /none/ you cant make out  any details on it but there is some sort of stitching in it  taliesin we do have his flag up though  matt yeah you do have the ships flag up above the mistake as these row boats steadily make  there way towards your ship the moment of possible parley approaching were going to end  the episode there well pick up there for our live show in new york next week  sam boats  liam boats in new york  marisha werent we on boats for our first gen con liveshow /none/  matt no you guys
