town	 city of zadash along the way you were passing by the city of alfield just past the  sunset as an incursion of a gnoll warband began to set fire to a number of the buildings you rushed  in to aid some of the denizens there jumped in under the watch of bryce the watchmaster there  and managed to slay a few but they managed to escape with a number of bodies and living members  of the community you were then given the opportunity to make some money and to wreak some  proper vengeance for this 
town	 town by finding out where these gnolls were and retrieve those who  were still living andor the bodies of those that needed to at least be given a proper burial along  that path you discovered this underground network of what was an abandoned mine where they had been  holing up while you were travelling down there and battling with these gnolls as you did you  encountered a new ally this individual named shak√§ste and his amazing little dark hummingbird  all of you together managed to make your way through save a number of lives burps 
town	 pardon  me encounter the priest of these gnollish creatures who had been using these members of the  town to help feed a mother manticore to retrieve some of the living members you managed to get  into battle with it nott slew the baby manticore drawing its ire and you all by the skin of your  teeth took both the priest and her out and in doing so saved the lives of those that were  within retrieved a small bounty of things that were caught within the nest and the priests  corpse and made your 
town	 way back to town upon arriving  shuffling chairs laughter  travis anything for that buttshot sam  matt thats sams gift to you guys upon returning the sun had set a number of members of  the city of alfield began to thank you for what youve done they began to come out into the  streets and began to make small campfires and play music and basically take this moment to both  grieve and be thankful that there are individuals who will stand up and show strength in the face of  darkness even this far out 
none	 on the edges of the empire in this time you realize right about now  that your new friend shak√§ste seems to have vanished from the vicinity you glance about and  at a quick look hes gone  laura where did shak√§ste go  sam i dont know hes very mysterious  marisha hes the coolest  laura hes like the wind gasps maybe he was the traveler  sam what does that mean the traveler  laura the traveler  sam what does that mean  travis its like a deity  laura well yeah mostly yeah  
none	 sam oh  laura i mean he takes many forms  sam do you worship the traveler  laura maybe im the traveler  sam okay maybe she doesnt worship the traveler  laura i mean yeah sure i worship him sure hes more like my best friend  travis jester dont you think that if that was the traveler he would have said hey im the traveler  laura probably  marisha he didnt seem very irreverent in the way the traveler seems to be  travis yep  laura how do you know what the travelers like do 
none	 you hang out with the traveler too  marisha no but i hang out with you  laura oh right well hes probably not the traveler then  liam i liked that guy though he was good  marisha he was  travis he was pretty cool  liam he was talented  sam are you okay caleb you went a little quiet there for a little while  marisha is that your first time killing something or somebody  liam he was burned alive in front of me  marisha yeah you did that though  liam i am 
none	 well aware that i killed a person i have nothing else to say why is everyone looking at me  laura have you ever killed someone before  travis we were worried you kind of went into a state just making sure you are all right  liam im okay  travis all right yeah  liam it was terribly grisly his hair was on fire and he burned horribly maybe it went a little  further than i anticipated i have killed people before in defense ja but not like that  taliesin well theres one surefire way to 
tavern	 make sure that hes all right which is we get drunk  on something really expensive and listen to the stories of all the people we just saved so you  can feel better about everything that just happened  liam okay that sounds good  taliesin and were going to spend a ridiculous amount of the money we just made  laura im okay with that  marisha i am too  sam oh didnt we get some items as well  laura oh yeah who was it that had that stuff  travis apparently i raise my hand

none	 and soot from the remains of the previous owner its a set of  goggles that can be comfortably placed over your head and the glass elements or the lenses of them  have a bluishpurple sheen to them  marisha i put them on  liam would you like to know what they are before you put them on  marisha too late man its like thir13en ghosts screams no i dont know  laura what does it look like is it like a kaleidoscope  matt when you place them over your eyes because immediately in the vicinity 
dung	 theres the few small  bonfires people have gathered around other than  that its a dark night sky with stars peeking through the  elements of the clouds that have broken apart it looks like a cloudfront is still blowing in from  the eastern side of the valley but from what little bit of the sky you can see the stars are  there upon placing the lenses over your eyes you have clear definition of all the nearby buildings  the dark alleyways you have a very clear perspective on anything that is not directly being  
none	 hit by firelight and the firelight is almost a little too bright  marisha holy shit you guys is this what you can see all the time  laura i dont know what does it look like  marisha its like i got night vision like i can see things  liam look over here you look like a nerd  marisha i can deal with that its fine  travis thats great with you humans  marisha i can see shit  travis yeah its real important we were running into problems  taliesin im curious can i try 
none	 them on really quick  laura do they fit over your  taliesin no i got to unstrap them im holding them up  matt it tugs all of your horn jewelry and under it in an uncomfortable way  travis jingle jangle jingle jingle  matt no effect actually  taliesin yeah this is nothing  marisha lies  travis hey caleb  liam yeah  sam can you see through my clothes  marisha do you want me to see through your clothes  sam no  marisha nah  travis i remember you have an ability to

none	 that i have on my fingers have a pearl on them  sam how about the one that i stole from her  matt the ring that would have the pearl on it is no longer on your hand and the one that you have  does have set into it a fairly nice pearl  laura gasps you have a pearl  sam would you  liam is that worth about a hundred gold pieces  matt you can certainly try  liam oh yes let me can i borrow this  sam i want it back though  
tavern	 liam this is not instantaneous since i am so tired it takes me a little bit longer i wedge  out one of my books and i set it on the ground  marisha do you want to go to  taliesin instead of setting a book on the ground lets sit at a table at a pub or bar  travis well make sure youre not disturbed  liam its up to you i havent done this in a while and im excited to do it but i could hold  off a little  taliesin i require drink 
tavern	 and lumbar support  liam okay i take the book and i close it and then i put it back  laura do you want me to carry it for you  liam no i have both the ring and the one that fjord gave me so if its good for you you may  have it im more interested in executing skill  travis okay yeah molly i need something from you  taliesin yes  travis find us a fucking bar  taliesin on it  sam should we just go to the feed and mead  laura 
tavern	 lets do it  sam or somewhere else  laura i hope they have milk  travis because the candleglow inn is fucking toast  taliesin im going to just literally yell at the top of my lungs in the middle of the crowd im  looking for the best pub in this bloody town  matt as soon as you finish screaming it you turn around and go face to face with crute the rather  roughlooking dwarf who runs the feed and mead where you guys have been staying he goes huh  that would be my place 
none	 where you are staying  taliesin onward  matt everyone around is like eh but hes already got your attention he leads you guys  back to the familiar feed and mead where has been empty previously when you guys were staying there  now there seems to be a little bit of an air of celebration since that is where you guys are  going other people are following and it seems the party is going where youre going as you enter  the place crute seems excited because now all of a sudden theres a burst in clientele 
town	  travis pub crawl  sam theres only one pub  matt as you begin to order your drinks many of the various villagers prevent you from paying for  the remainder of the evening your drinks are on the town of alfield  travis very very generous fucking drink up  liam before we even go into the building i go over to nott and adjust the hood a little bit  further forward  sam are my ears tucked back in  liam the ears are in and make sure that the mask is secure have fun  
none	 sam okay youre really all right caleb  liam yeah im okay it was a rough night  sam i know but you went a bit catatonic  liam i did  sam did you see anything or have a vision i dont know  liam no i did not see a vision i saw a burning person  sam all right they were bad  liam lets go get a drink  sam all right  taliesin anybody who tries to buy me a drink i slip a silver into their pocket let me know how  low we

none	 into my flask and going up and asking for another  matt fair enough make it three gold laughs caleb youre spending time  liam im going to find a corner table in the ruckus i will take the ring with the pearl and i  hold it right here i pull out the other ring and i look at it and i begin to focus and study the  different angles of it and hope that i have a pearl of enough value to make things happen  laura im going to sit next to caleb and watch it 
none	 all happen  matt it is riveting  laura dont you need to pull out your book so you can look at your spells  liam its already out  laura oh  liam you know when you play dd you dont narrate taking a pooper but you can assume that  the characters take a pooper every day  travis chagrined i narrated it  laura this is true  liam some things just happen  laura while hes doing everything hes doing im going try to very subtly draw a dick in his book  matt make a

none	 taliesin oh youre going to do your thing  marisha i go up and head up to the room as well  laura im going to doodle and talk to the traveler  matt you all find yourselves going about what final business you have for the evening before  rest takes you you are doing your  liam well i first take out the silver thread and i cross it across the door and if theres any  windows there i do the same and allow for nott to enter and leave then i draw patterns along the  
none	 floor that spread up onto the table as well and back down onto the floor i squat with my book  since i am tapped and i begin to bring back my cat an hour and ten minutes later i dont know  if theyre asleep or not i have this cat named frumpkin and i wear him like a scarf  matt you watch as you finish the incantation and the ritual comes to a complete cycle in the  center of where you made these markers across the table you hear this slight tearing sound and there  
none	 is this slight ripple in the air right in front of you in the center of this and its almost like a  slight little tear in reality almost from that frumpkin steps out and lands looks up at you  meows  liam come here i promise  matt immediately leaps up into your hands  liam i promise not to do that too often i just scritch for a long time  matt he purrs against you  marisha he cant even hear about it  laura can i draw the general gnoll peeing on a little fire 
none	 hydrant and the rest of the gnolls  behind him fighting over a bone  matt easy enough to do  laura then im going to draw the cutest baby manticore youve ever seen and its dead im going  to tell the traveler you know i dont know whats going on im just hoping that youre here  because this is the farthest ive ever gone and im afraid that you cant hear me anymore and its  freaking me out a little bit because i know that im around a bunch of people now and i havent  
none	 been before but i want you to know that youre still my best friend and if you want me to be  alone i will be if that means that youll be here  marisha beau just reaches over and hands her a kleenex  laura thank you okay thats all good night what  marisha nothing  laura did you hear that  marisha im in the room with you  laura oh right  marisha im reading while she was doing that im opening the letters from the baumbauchs  matt oh right  travis and laura oh 
none	 shit  matt well finishing up with you as you finish that and lay down you lay on one side staring  towards the wall in this moment of quiet you feel this strange warmth and you look down underneath  your robes and there you have the symbol of the traveler that you keep on yourself the door arch  and path and its warm to the touch warmer than your skin is the subtle sensation of familiar  closeness comes over you and wordless but an emotion washes through your brain thats alien  from the outside of 
none	 your own thoughts that just says im with you  laura i take the symbol and i hold it up to my cheek and i go to sleep  matt okay you start going through there were four letters clustered in here you tear through the  first one and look at it and it looks like its a shipment ledger up by nogvurot nogvurot its a  city on the northern end of the empire its just an information ledger about shipments received  confirming payment and distribution to which taverns are receiving it and then asking for the 
tavern	  next shipment the second one that you open is another ledger this one comes from deastok to the  west this ones cheaper its a smaller ledger the third one you open up and its a complaint  marisha kissing sounds what is it  matt from rexxentrum its titled by it doesnt have the name but it says the purveyor of  the rotted stump which is apparently some sort of bar or tavern saying to the baumbauch family i  would happily request that if you are to send the aforementioned and already paid shipments to our 
none	  establishment that they would not be containing any sort of animals of which could chew through  and ruin and spoil the shipments youve been given we request an immediate refund it shows a  copy of a deal that was made its just an open complaint  marisha nice  matt the fourth ones a little interesting its just titled to demedan baumbauch specifically  all demedan ooh  liam im sure that ones not important  sam its mostly about mayonnaise  laura hes totally looking  liam i know  taliesin dear mr mayo we relish 
none	 the time weve had together  marisha would i recognize what this word means  matt make an intelligence check  marisha do i get any time of advantage for being a shifty person  matt no because this would be an investigation check specifically not an intelligence it would  be an investigation  marisha is this a code is this backwards this is backwards isnt it fuck balls  taliesin you dont know  marisha eight  matt eight well youre just going to have to figure it out on your own  liam singing fuck balls  
none	 marisha toordolbo  sam well come back to you  marisha do i know what the evening nip is do i recognize that  matt you dont actually  travis you dont know the old evening nip  laughter  marisha i finish reading everything i go over to a sleeping jester pull her blankets up and tuck  her in a little bit and then i crash out  matt okay  sam two quick things one id like to ask caleb when hes done with his insanely long ritual that  pouch that i gave you what was 
none	 in it  liam did you give me a pouch  sam oh i gave you a pouch before you might not have felt it but its in your back pocket  liam when did you do that  sam before  liam oh what is in it lets see  matt which pouch is this  laura shak√§stes  matt oh shak√§stes pouch you find what is roughly a handful of bird seed  laura wouldnt it be funny if there was like two copper and a bunch of bird seed  matt well its a heavy pouch and 
town	 contains about 113 gold pieces  all whoa  laura shak√§ste was fucking loaded  liam one  laura oh jeez  liam two  taliesin no long rest for you  liam and then ten minutes later  matt theres some dried jerky and hide in there just for trail snacks it seemed like a half road  travel pack that shak√§ste was keeping with him and whatever coin he had brought with him on the journey  laura you stole an old blind mans food and money  sam i am the best  liam did you say 
none	 113  matt 113  liam okay so after counting it all i separate it and i put some jerky down go have it to  frumpkin and i push 60 gold across the floor come here  sam yes ow  travis that was five of them  sam no thats good because my muscles are sore from smiling before  matt it does help a little  sam then im going to try to make acid while he was doing his thing  matt go ahead and make an alchemy supplies check roll that plus your proficiency bonus 
none	 and your  intelligence  sam 19 plus things  matt it will take you through the night and part of the morning to do it with a full nights  sleep a full rest if you start early enough in the night by about noon tomorrow youd be done  sam all right  matt throughout that you manage to create a vial of acid  sam awesome  liam i have a question the metal on the ring with the pearl in it what is it made of can i tell  matt looking at it it looks 
none	 like the base material for the pearl set in its a polished brass  that has been treated to look like gold but some of that treatment is rubbing off and you can see  the duller brass color beneath  liam i cannot remember but caleb can because of keen mind brass is that part of the alchemy that  i can do  matt i will look as far as your school of transmutation  liam yeah that is correct  sam you have copper and silver for sure  liam copper silver wood  sam iron  
none	 liam i just cant remember if it is do we have a players handbook  matt wood stone iron copper or silver  liam brass is not on it okay then im going to spend the last 30 minutes before bed trying to  slowly wedge the pearl out of the ring i dont want the ring  matt okay make a general strength check  laura the pearl pops out and flies across the room never to be found again  liam 15  matt 15 it doesnt take you too long working on it back and forth you 
none	 eventually have enough give  where the four claws that hold the pearl into the ring set eventually give way and it pops out it  does hit the ground and roll and you quickly catch up to it and grab it  sam its bronze  liam brass  sam brass okay  liam i take whats left of the ring and i throw it across the room for frumpkin to go chasing it across  matt frumpkin just watches it land thunk thunk  liam go chase that  matt meows  travis while everybody is going up 
none	 to their rooms can i stay down are you staying down  taliesin oh im going upstairs im going to pass out on the floor  travis ill stay downstairs and do some peoplewatching call it character study  matt okay yeah looking about at this point in the evening most of it is filtering out the few  stragglers there are the older folks grizzled farmhands with sunburned skin thick fingers that  have seen a lot of field work a lot of them reminiscing about days of old some of them  talking about some folks they know 
tavern	 that were lost over the previous events but they seem drunk  enough to at least be smiling and laughing about these old stories they bring up you continue to  study these personalities i imagine youre probably taking in quirks taking in elements of  their body language their vocal intonations for your own purposes  travis very well  matt okay as you all eventually close the evening the morning sun comes to with nott  sleeping in a little further after staying up late creating a vial of acid  travis please tell me she has bedhead 
town	  laura one ears up  matt what do you guys want to do  marisha hey jester  laura hey what  marisha i want to show you something  laura okay what  marisha you know how i stole some shit from the baumbauchs on our way out of town most of its  boring shit but i stayed up and i was trying to solve it and figure some of this stuff out take a  look at this what do you think  laura okay im really smart so ill probably be able to figure it 
none	 out demedan your request has  been approved and the toordolbo extract will be arriving in a case of rose wine from the evening  nip in the coming week many gifts the gentleman  marisha whispering the gentleman whos the gentleman  laura i dont know but i like your addition of douche to demedan i agree  marisha uhhuh i wanted to put a reminder for myself  laura oh yeah who specializes in a ros√© youre right thats weird especially not the baumbauchs  marisha no the baumbauchs dont make ros√©  laura no they make like

none	 know of bloodroot  matt make a nature check  marisha nature check  laura would i know bloodroot  matt make a nature check you both may make a nature check in this moment in a strike of inspiration  laura 20  marisha better than me 13  matt okay youve heard it somewhere nothing big but like bloodroot ive heard of it you  know it its a unique flower that is pretty in its own right but you know it because the places  where its used are usually fenced off in a way that children 
none	 cant get to them because they are  known to be poisonous not to the point of death but to the point of severe nausea and vomiting  upon ingestion  laura oh bloodroot thats right its a type of flower superduper red i know because i tried to  make a paint out of one of the flowers one time and it made me want to like seriously puke my guts  out and do the spins if you know what i mean super bad thats bad  marisha and theyre wanting an extract so  laura that means 
none	 it would be extra strong yeah  marisha are the baumbauchs trying to poison people  laura oh my gosh well the gentleman wants to poison people oh no the baumbauchs yeah i  understand wow do we need to tell someone about this  marisha no just keep it in the back of your head if you hear something if something spikes your interest  laura if we hear about an outbreak of people vomiting  marisha or about a gentleman  laura or about a ros√©  marisha and an evening nip  laura yeah  marisha i

town	 is apparently they are in  the process of going through paperwork in the salt trench jail thats where the prisoners of  alfield this podunk town keep there imprisoned being led to this small but functional shack of  stone and dried wood eventually bryce emerges not fully armored but theyre wearing comfortable  robes with a bit of the ceremonial maroon and gold that a lot of the crownsguard and members of that  political faction seem to wear as they emerge you see bryces face brighten up as they say  youre awake come ive been able

town	 frosty  liam stop  marisha dont make me laugh  travis she shouldnt laugh at that  marisha this is some bullshit  travis a rib will be pulled when you turn and sneeze  matt yeah dont turn and sneeze  marisha therapeutic dd right now  matt exactly speaking of which guys youve begun your trek northward back on the amber road  passing through the high grass fields the rolling hills the sky grows more cloudy and as the day  progresses uneventful three horses carrying crownsguard are patrolling down the amber road and  pass 
none	 by and watch them nod as they continue on as you continue down for the remainder of the  day you guys probably left around noon eight hours of travel would say is a standard travel  day for a horse so thatll be just past sunset  laura well nott slept in until noon so we probably left a couple of hours after that  matt thats true so you get back a little bit on the travel not too bad continuing on you hit  sunset and your horse could go for a few more hours do you 
town	 wish to continue to travel in the  night follow the road  liam no why would we be ambitious like that were not in a hurry  laura is there a good place to make shelter  taliesin id say we pull off if we see something really nice  matt right as the sky begins to grow dark enough to threaten vision for distant vision at least  you use darkvision you have a closer proximity  marisha i put on my goggles way too early im super stoked about them  laughter  laura im just seeing 
dung	 you at burning man  marisha yeah totally 100 percent thats kind of how i imagined them is burner goggles  matt the sky is as dark and the distance is as hard to see but nearby theres some decent  shapes and outlines  liam ferris bueller all the time  matt yep  liam im sorry dont laugh  matt are you in here for drugs no what are you in for drugs you dont see any landmarks  that would gather your attention to be a place to stay or stop at or rest for the evening 
town	 your best  plans would be to look for something not far off the road in the natural environment to make camp  who is helming that expedition  laura ill help him  matt both you guys roll perception  laura did you roll good  taliesin i did 19 thank you gil  laura 17  matt okay you find a small clearing that looks to be a handful of rocks that were partially  lodged into the ground long ago that have since been overgrown with moss and grass but there is a  bit a small 
town	 opening where it looks to be the remains of charcoal a fire has once or many  times been built and then put out there so it looks like a standard place where people have set  up camp while making their trips up and down the amber road easy enough to do so you guys set up  for the evening you gather yourselves around build a small fire  laura you should use your glove and make a fire for us  travis oh right before the day goes  laura well unless something attacks us again  
none	 liam if you are going to do that we all need to stand 50 feet back  laura why  liam because its not a little fut fut its a big one  laura oh okay never mind then who has a fut fut  liam i have a fut fut  laura okay then do it  liam fire burning  matt it doesnt make much of a fut fut much to your disappointment but a fire is built you all  begin to bed down for the evening and whos taking first watch  liam i am  
dung	 matt okay you can break it up between probably lets say three watches over a casual evening  travis ill take the second  marisha ill take the last  matt perception check from you please  liam yeah okay ten  matt okay an uneventful evening continues for you you trade off to fjord fjord make a  perception check  travis nine  matt your mighty nine allows you to keep an eye out as the dark perimeter seems to bring no shapes  or movements of interest other than the occasional sound of the wind blowing through 
dung	 the fields and  the distant dark then your watch is up beauregard perception check please  marisha seven  lauda oh god  liam its gotten lower and lower  matt keeping an eye out best you can the sleep takes you eventually and you end up cheating on  the last few hours of your watch nevertheless you all come to consciousness in the morning  intact and fine you begin your way further on the road for a second day now whos guiding the i  would say more of whos keeping a perimeter watch during the 
none	 next days journey  travis i will  laura ill help  matt all right so one of you two well say thats the case make a perception check with  advantage because of jesters aiding  travis thank you jester  laura youre welcome  travis oh jeez thats terrible nine  laughter  matt keeping with the theme of the name i guess  taliesin for the record were hiding all of our valuables if thats okay making sure everything  is stowed i would assume were hiding all of  laura you know how to do that 
town	 because youre on the road a lot  taliesin yeah i know how  travis thats even worse  marisha we did scoop up those chains right we put those in the wagon  laura yeah of course  matt yeah those are still with you  liam the shitty manacles  laura yeah that well sell to a blacksmith  liam yeah excellent  marisha metals valuable man  laura along with this giant sledgehammer  liam that is a glaive  laura no i have a sledgehammer too  liam oh thats right you also picked up a 
town	 sledgehammer yeah sledge  matt continuing on for the rest of the day eventually you pass by a small travel wagon its  similar to the size of the cart that you have but it has some cushioned seats set up in the back  you look towards three well dressed individuals that are looking miserable theyre sitting in the  back of the cart as it rides by with a single coachman whose single horse is pulling it along  with a rather rapid pace you watch as they begin to approach the few bumps that hit the road 
none	 are  hitting them relatively hard because of the pace of which theyre keeping some of them kind of get  flung up and you watch their hair get mussed and they quickly put it back into place  marisha what kind of cargo does it look like they have  matt make a perception check  laura i want to draw a sketch of them in a little pan popping like popcorn  matt okay  marisha as shes doing that im trying to get jesters attention im like jester jester  laura what  marisha 13 whispers the 
none	 gentlemen  laura whispers the gentlemen  matt the best you can tell the cargo within are personal bags theres nothing of what looks to be  cargo cargo at least what you have seen in previous bits of people that have traveled down  here especially the trade caravan you passed on your way up to alfield this looks to be more of a  personnelbased journey they pass glaring as they look at your colorful variety of individuals  laura are they going the opposite direction than us  matt yeah heading south  laura whispering should i 
none	 ask if theyre the gentlemen shouting good to see you gentlemen  marisha gentlemen do any of them look  sam like a gentleman  marisha like a gentleman  matt i mean theyre welldressed they look to be of bourgeois class not upper crust but better  than most youve encountered on this side of the empire at least and they seem to almost aside  from glaring as you pass pay no mind to any of your verbiage beyond you motherfuckers  marisha i think they thought we were patronizing them  laura oh yeah probably  marisha 
none	 we kind of were though  laura yeah kind of  marisha what  liam it worked never mind  matt all right continuing on for the remainder of the day seeing nothing else that catches your  eye along the journey eventually the night comes to a close once more you guys have pretty much  hit the extent of your horses energy for the days travel right as the sun begins to set so you can  pull off and make another camp for this evening  laura we find a good place  matt whos helming that 
town	 one  laura i mean we did such a good job last time  taliesin yeah lets do it again  matt go for it  laura oh no that is bad  taliesin this is perception  matt yes  taliesin 14  laura five  matt not too ooh not good for you thats fine easy enough you find  laura i find grass  matt you find maybe a few hundred feet off of the eastern side of the amber road a small dip in  the ground it looks like an area where the earth seems 
town	 to sink almost a bit this crucibletype  look for maybe 60 or so feet there in the center you see another wellused stop along the way  theres some discarded empty scraps of sack you can see a couple of small stone rings where fires  were previously set theres a lot of travel on this road and so its not too difficult if  youre keeping an eye out for a while to find some place thats been used over time as a place  to rest for the evening so you set up camp there without an 
none	 issue  taliesin yeah set up again  laura do we put an alarm around us in case  liam i do that every night  laura oh wonderful  liam its just a given  laura nice  taliesin thats a griffin  liam a gifin  laura should we three take watch since those three took watch last time  taliesin thats only fair  sam yes that sounds good  taliesin ill take watch number one  sam ill take number two  laura ill take number three  liam yes dm i would like to say 
none	 that too if were ever camping outside just because liam is a  dumb fuck and will forget it every night caleb does silver thread around the group  matt right for a 20foot cube  liam okay thats around us yeah  matt all right so after setting up your alarm  liam singing its murder time in the campaign  matt as you complete your set up for the evening make a perception check  taliesin six  travis what the fuck we cant roll perception for shit  taliesin i shouldnt have touched this die this die 
none	 has been nothing but trouble  matt okay you are sitting back for a minute  the fire crackling to a very diminutive ember  theres just a bit of light slowly flickering off framing the outer shapes of your various sleeping  friends and companions you dont hear the snapping of twigs because its subtle enough a  brief tickle hits the back of your head caleb as the thread perimeter is broken  liam nein nein up up  matt as that happens a voice goes i wouldnt do that if i were you at which point you 
none	  immediately whip around and you guys see in the vicinity standing directly around where youre  sleeping you see nine figures  marisha nine are they mightier than us though  matt this number coming up is so creepy you guys they all look humanoid some variation to  height but most of them seem to be standard human size various degrees of patchwork hide armors  some leathers a lot of what seems to be cobbled together and scrapped to build some sort of  defense you see a uniform mismatch of green blues and black cloths that 
none	 are covering most of  the faces and hoods  marisha green and black thats weird  matt ones green ones blue couple of black  marisha oh my god were fighting the ninja turtles  sam thatd be purple blue and orange  matt yeah completely different thing as you all begin to come to conscious and look around you  can see some of them have hand crossbows that theyre holding out in front two of them have  heavy crossbows that are currently being held with two hands that are all locked in there are a few 
none	  of them that have shortswords drawn one in each hand theyre all threatening but not raring to  leap the one that had spoken out against that whos right behind you molly with his boot  presses it against the blade of one of your scimitars and says i would recommend you just  take a step away from that you feel this very sharp point of a nocked crossbow bolt that taps  the back of your skull  taliesin oh youre so polite how could i refuse i just get up im not turning around  both 
none	 my scimitars or just one of them  matt theyre both set in your usual placed wrapping your ceremonial set before you go to bed  at night  taliesin im just going to walk to the cart then  matt okay  marisha wait do they have them  matt hes stepping on them right now  taliesin im walking to the cart  matt okay as you begin to walk towards the cart which is breaking the perimeter of their holding  the ones on that side go disapproving sounds the one who spoke up before just goes 
none	 all right  no big moves no trouble wanted get your friends up place your valuables onto that cart for us  you have hitched over there and well leave you with your life no worries   liam i would like to cast friends on that gentleman  matt okay make a sleight of hand check  liam ah thats very low that is a five  matt as soon as you begin to and correct me if im wrong friends actually let me see here  friends is no its  liam somatic and material all i did 
none	 was just do this with my thumb and i put a little bit of rouge  on my cheek  matt okay yeah so your charisma checks the spell seems to take an effect  liam youll have to be careful we are going for help medical help we all have syphilis  extreme syphilis  matt make a deception check  travis extreme  marisha oh my god brilliant  liam is this with advantage right thats the effect of the spell  matt yeah it gives you advantage yeah  liam yeah oh yeah  sam ah thats

none	  matt then i suggest you all just get down on your knees and stay where you are were just  going to take your cart and whats inside of it  liam what was that  matt take the cart and whats inside of it they all begin to shift slowly all keeping their  weapons drawn begin to move over towards the cart one of them hops up into the back and begins  rummaging through the stuff  taliesin i wouldnt touch that that might ooh  laura oh no thats where we got our syphilis from 
none	  taliesin theres a severed head in there  marisha yeah look out for that manticore head theyre diseased  matt at which point one of them pull over a cloth he goes jesus chri they all turn  around weapons drawn again like what the fuck are these people doing  liam no we might have tried a few things with that head but you know weve paid the price  clearly we have suffered enough  matt looks over to fjord  laura hes just laughing  matt you also infected  laughter  liam i mean the

none	 entirety of your  campsite all of you begin to come to consciousness finishing your long rest by  immediately being drenched in freezing water of a recent storm here on the marrow valley fields  laura hey you guys its raining  taliesin are you sure  laura yeah  taliesin have you checked  laura yeah  taliesin hold on  marisha camping sucks  taliesin yeah thats rain thats a little water im going to fold my coat up and put it  away just vest and vestiture  travis i take out that heavy cloak and

town	 the path and continue  forward whos keeping watch on this next journey perception check for me please  liam its a 12  matt you glance off the side of the western edge of the amber road and see a neglected gravesite  maybe 300 feet off the roads path its overgrown in the fields at a quick glance you can gather  maybe close to 200 various stones that are grave markers in various states of disrepair and erosion  over time as you ride past and see in the distance it looks to be an older landmark 
town	 thats  been left to be reclaimed by nature  liam at our closest where do we get to it before passing it  matt youd probably get about 80 or 90 feet from it  liam is everybody sleeping  matt no everyones up in the cart or riding  liam okay  matt you guys continue on past up the road are you still keeping watch on this  liam am i controlling the cart at this point if everybody is sleeping  laura were all on horses  liam were all just going and im keeping watch

none	 get about 30 or 40 feet within range of it and start taking a tinkle  matt okay  taliesin im going to crawl over there on my horse as well and get a feel of it  matt okay as youre finishing your business you can get within 30 feet or so and you see that a  lot of the stones are intact some of them have been cracked and broken a lot of them what once  may have been a wellkept perimeter of earth dirt and dust has since been completely retaken  by the grasses 
none	 of the field while the grasses arent as tall as the surrounding field may be  the greenery and the moss has taken a lot of the stone and to read a lot of them you would probably  have to clear off whatever bit of growth has reached up and claimed them  taliesin im going to pick a random one  liam after i shake it and put it away i move my fingers in a shape in the air and whisper a few  arcane words and cast detect magic within range of the gravestones  matt 
none	 okay as you begin to do a conscious pass across the grave nothing magical catches your  attention within the radius youre observing  liam okay i squeeze out a single fart and go back to the cart  taliesin anything undead anything  matt make an investigation check  travis nein  taliesin with advantage or no  matt as youre seeking anything thats related to the undead yeah go for it  taliesin natural 20  matt okay  taliesin im cleaning off one  matt as you pick one and look for any signs of grave emerging 
none	 or grave robbery or different  things that may be attributed to the necromantic studies that involve the creation andor  maintenance of undead the site seems to be largely undisturbed you go through one name and  it says bagent and the next once you go by says avryn and the next stone says emor the  markings are simple theyre very simple stones it looks like whoever was buried here was done so  at the very basic level of marking a grave site your foot hits something hard on the ground and  your toe and you 
none	 look down at a rusted helmet of iron make you pick it up make a history check  marisha whisper chants scrap metal scrap metal scrap metal  travis like nobodys going to want metal and were just going to be driving around that busted  jalopy with a shitload of metal  taliesin nothing six  matt youre unable to make out any details of the construction of it or any significance of it but  its an old helmet and it looks like a lot of the edges of it appear to have just slowly been taken  
none	 by the oxidization  taliesin im going to take it back anyway  matt as you guys are waiting calebs returned and a few minutes later maybe about ten minutes  after you watch as molly approaches tossing this deeply rusted iron helmet in his hand  liam what is that can i see that  taliesin of course  liam yeah i would like to do i recognize this  matt make a history check  liam yeah  sam its yorick  liam yeah that is a 14  matt okay you have a little more grasp and 
none	 understanding of the history of the valley the  markings on this indicate that this helmet belonged to a regiment of the julous dominion the  julous dominion which you recall is the last remaining empire to be conquered by the dwendalian  empire nearly two centuries before  marisha julous what  liam julous dominion two centuries  matt zadash was the capital of that empire before the dwendalian rule conquered them and took over  as opposed to erasing their society they just allowed it to be integrated into their own  beliefs and then just imposed their 
none	 life upon those people their laws their rules and  adjusted as they saw fit that marked the end of it this gravesite seems to have been a reminder  of soldiers that fought probably in those conflicts or something around that time period  and has just been left to the annals of memory as the dwendalian influence left no real particular  interest in those to keep tabs of the history behind them  liam caleb says you know its funny and then says everything that you just did to everyone in  the group  taliesin thats 
none	 very interesting  laura and marisha wow  liam heres your helmet back  travis thats very informative caleb  marisha we can still sell that for scrap metal though right  laura i mean its pretty rusty  marisha yeah  laura like maybe to a museum or something  liam steeped in history  laura the dwendalian empire kind of sucks you guys  marisha ive lived here my whole life its kind of lame  laura i mean the menagerie coast is really cool  marisha never been that far  laura oh its amazing  marisha 
none	 been a lot of places in dwendalian but not that far  sam there must be some nice places here right  laura i dont know everything ive seen so far  sam well that village we were just in was not bad except for you know the gnoll attack  laura thats true and bryce was a soldier of the dwendalian empire  marisha theyre on the outskirts the further on the outskirts you go the more tolerable they are  further north we go  liam the further out you are the easier it is to bend the 
none	 rules  laura whats the capital of the dwendalian empire  marisha its  sam lets consult our notes  laura is it rexxentrum  matt and travis rexxentrum  sam oh thats where the magic school is right  laura yeah  marisha im just telling you the more north we go the stricter its going to get youre going  to see more and more of the empire and its influence  laura crazy  sam maybe theyll have nicer things arts culture  marisha of course they will its where all the money is  liam they 
none	 have the best of the best in the north ja  laura do they like arts and culture in the dwendalian empire  liam what and culture  liam and laura arts and culture  laura do they like painting  marisha farts and vultures  liam what are you talking about  marisha never mind  liam i hear  laura yeah okay thats good  marisha yeah  matt you guys continue moving northward again the rain still pouring as you all maintain warmth  best you can bundling up with the various travel supplies blankets and insulation 
town	 you can muster  off the cart and your own  laura i was taking in the rain yo i like it  sam hard to tell what motions youre doing  laura shut up i could see it in my head  liam frumpkin is fucking miserable because hes drenched and he does not like to be wet  matt yep sad meow as you push into the latter half of the afternoon a few hours before the sun  begins to set you begin cresting a large hill along the road before you notice a trio of spiky 
none	  peaks catching your eye breaking the skyline ahead of you as you begin to come higher up to  the top of that hillside you can watch these peaks slowly unveil into the rest of the massive  skyline of the city of zadash breaking the horizon  laura gasps oh my gosh  matt its an incredible sight compared to the rural townships youve encountered here in the  empire thus far and comparable in mass to the coastal metropolis of port damali where you grew  up the 15foot perimeter walls outline the somewhat triangular shape of 
town	 the city from your  current perspective the communities spilling beyond the protective bulwarks cascade beyond the  walls into ramshackle tent cities and hovel towns as you ride down the road towards the stretch that  leads to the southern gates you pass through fields of crop workers that are currently out  there with heavy shawls and head coverings in the process of harvesting various vegetables and crops  from the field some take note of your presence and watch as you pass and then go amongst their  work others are too involved could care less about 
none	 the constant passing of travelers northward  and southward as you approach closer to the city still the external neighborhoods begin to envelop  your vision as small farmsteads homes begin to mingle with these tents and shacks you had seen at  a distance a mother in ragged clothes plucks a chicken before noticing your band and sending her  sixyearold boy over dirt smeared on his face and no shoes running up to the mud outside the  cart and puts his hands out towards you as you walk past  marisha i toss him a silver  
none	 matt he takes it and runs back to his mom and she just nods doesnt make eye contact with you but  as soon as the child approaches gives a nod continues pulling feathers out pushing on the  foot traffic  liam sorry caleb trips or pretends to into the mud and scoops up two fistfuls of mud and shoves  them into his pockets  matt okay easily enough pushing on the foot traffic grows heavier near the gate a huge  15foot wide currently open portcullis is being held aloft by chains beyond your visual range as 
none	  two pairs of crownsguards flank each side of this opening with semiwatchful eyes theyre not  interrogating passersby theyre keeping a close watch as folks enter in and out you can see  another caravan is currently in the process of loading up and getting ready to leave southward  you can see people are walking in and out from the external shantytown and other individuals are  some are paying attention to the rather once again your colorful band by comparison most of the  folks you see here range between your typical human populace to the occasional 
town	 halfling and  dwarf the fairer races beyond that havent caught your eye yet on this exterior perimeter stepping  beyond the crownsguard keeping a watch as you pass you emerge beyond the threshold of the entry  gate on the southern wall here into zadash the smell of wet earth manure immediately hits your  nose accompanied by the sound of hooves mingling conversations distant shouts and the barking of  dogs as they welcome you into this new and interesting city glancing up you can see the  buildings around you that flank the street continue to be 
none	 rather destitute in the atmosphere  but then eventually begin to graduate into a standard village feel youve arrived  liam is it still raining  matt it is still raining  sam this place sucks too much water  travis we should find a place to take some shelter until this rain lets up  sam are we supposed to go to the pillow trove or the leaky tap  laura well we should probably hit the leaky tap first in the west outersteads  liam agreed that is our first stop  taliesin east  sam the east 
none	 westersheets what was it  taliesin east best western  laura it was in the west outersteads  sam i thought it was the east outer  liam we are looking for claudia sheed  marisha east  taliesin east  laura it was  marisha i dont know i didnt catch it i got claudia sheed  liam i remember exactly and matthew will tell me because of my keen mind feat  taliesin this is the best thing youve ever done  liam it was entirely on purpose  matt bryce when you were talking about this bryce 
town	 grew up in the west outersteads but leaky  tap is in the east  laura aww  matt still take your notes  marisha but bryce grew up in the west  liam i took the clippy feat  sam looks like youre writing a letter  liam looks like you cant remember the details the dm told you would you like to ask him again  and get an exact replication  matt as the horses are clopping through the mud and you guys are having this conversation slowly  making your way through town everyone else is 
none	 rushing about their business but youre just  leisurely just taking in the vicinity you hear this coughing off to the side and you watch as a  bundled up hunchedlooking human approaches and goes well hello you look a bit lost and  obviously not from around here as the face looks up you can see within the hood a somewhat  pudgylooking older man in his mid60s or so it looks to be he has a thick bushy gray mustache  that turns into a full stonewall beard on the side he has a monocle up in one 
none	 eye but it looks  a bit scratched the cloak hes wearing is just covering the rest of his form but as he looks and  goes im just happy to greet you to our fair city do you require anyone to help you around  show you the grounds  marisha how much  matt well for a days work that would merely run you a paltry two gold pieces  travis what might your name be kind stranger  matt i am ulysses stanneras ive lived here my entire life im a purveyor of all the great sites

none	 he takes the edges and daintily holds the cloak open presentery style and hes dressed in  very fine clothing like a nice coat thats buttoned with a little cravat and fine trousers  or at least they were at one point the edges are a little tattered it looks like his one nice  suit that hes had for maybe 20 years and its definitely seen some rough days you get the  sense from this whole package here that either he feigns some level of prominence or has fallen  very hard from it  travis well jester 
none	 if hes fine by you i mean lets get out of the rain im fucking soaked  laura he seems pretty okay i guess  sam to the tunnels  liam i cast friends on him  marisha so soon  sam friends  liam yes freunde  sam freundes  liam and i say my freunde  matt yes  liam i have just cast a spell on you okay so you just have to listen to what im saying okay  i think you are kind of an asshole but so are we we are the mighty nein

none	 there are a number of perimeter walls that have arches  between them almost like under a bridge and there are constructs houses that are built  through those gaps and in these small tunnels that are maybe 15 to 20 feet in length but you know  40 foot wide where these large separation barriers are and you can see along the top there are carts  that move on their own along these wall tops and it catches your eyes one of them shifts down its curious  marisha like a people mover  matt kind of  
none	 liam like a people mover  marisha like disney  sam they have a monorail  laura and marisha they have a monorail in zadash  matt he guides you underneath one of these arches  laura does it look shady in there i mean are there people in there  matt yeah there are people wandering through its just where one of the streets turns off to  it it sounded a lot shadier when he presented it than it was but its more just like a brief  respite from where people are walking through and occasionally you 
none	 see a couple crownsguard that  come through passing  liam this guy is good  taliesin forgive our friend someone attempted to mug us on the way into the city hes still a bit sore  matt oh thats all right  travis he recovered from four arrows to the chest  laura three actually because you got one  marisha i did  liam ja  travis my apologies  matt thats impressive mighty nein he pulls his hood back and he has this benjamin franklin  skullet going on where there its curly wavy gray hair but

none	 you have approved  entry and are heavily watched within for the most part you can peruse the content of the interior  liam that is excellent also im a big reader is there any place that has pulp fiction and  shitty smut  matt i mean im sure there are but i would not bother myself with such base interests of reading  liam insight check  matt make an insight check  liam that is 23  laura so many whispers  liam my friend i take him by the hands and say you have given us 
none	 a great welcome  into this city  matt my pleasure  liam so eager to learn all about it i take my hands away and he has two gold in his hand just  know im a big reader  matt then perhaps if you find your way somehow into the trispires southern quarter somewhere  in the vicinity of let me look it up real fast look at my own notes  liam it worked  matt on the southern side of the silken terrace youll find a place known as chastitys nook that  may be where 
none	 youll find what youre looking for friend  laura that was one of the names of the other courtesans at the place my mom  marisha thats a good name for her chastity nook yeah thats good  taliesin well probably be staying at the leaky tap  matt the leaky tap you say well its affordable  taliesin were trying to keep a low profile  matt fair enough fair enough the leaky tap thatll be in the east outersteads actually bit  of a rowdy clientele  taliesin perfect for me  matt its bawdy and fun  
none	 taliesin definitely perfect for me would you say theres a reasonable bathhouse for someone whos  laura stinky  taliesin and complicated in the horns  matt for your clientele  taliesin somewhere i can take a nice bath in peace  matt that could be you guys are really  travis yeah run us through it encyclopedia britannica give it to us  taliesin dont want to scare the locals too much  marisha not yet  travis dont you  matt the steams respite  taliesin thatll do it  liam caleb heard that  taliesin i throw 
none	 another gold at him you are a fount of information  matt thats what im here for  laura the pillow trove is that in the trispires  matt that is he glances quickly over towards caleb you arent planning to stay there are you  laura why  liam weve heard good things  matt they work for a certain clientele  taliesin you can be frank  laura what kind of clientele  matt those who live in the trispire or can afford to stay at the well youre welcome to try  laura are they super snooty 
town	 there  matt you could say that yes  laura do they not like you very much  matt not anymore  marisha you used to be a regular  matt i was a man about town yes  marisha was  matt well things change life changes partners disappear with your businesss goods and funds and  leave you having to make a living showing people around the city  marisha thats telling yeah  laura thats awful  sam that does sound terrible  matt its very sad i know but anyway  marisha what shop did you 
none	 used to own  matt we used to run a business that sold and traded leathers but i was ousted and ive been  scraping by ever since  marisha are you a craftsman in the trade  matt i was more of a business connection if you will my partner was the crafter i knew a few  things id picked up throughout the years but  marisha i mean a businessman can sell anything right why dont you get back into it you still  have all those connections  matt put it this way strangely enough i 
town	 make half as much with a quarter of the emphasis doing  what im doing for you now  marisha fair  laura lot of people come through town  matt a lot of people come through town  liam is it easy to work around the empire here  matt it can be you can look for work you can head to the he points out here this would be  the signet wall if youre more of a sellsword  marisha the signet wall  matt the signet wall thats where the military stays and most of the 
none	 crownsguard are holed up  laura lets not go there  marisha do you know a good blacksmith  matt the pentamarket would be a place where you could find there is the spark hammer smithing  that would be of aid to you theres also packwearers provisions but theyre more of a  smaller scale smithing goods tools and such  taliesin more of an antique collector  marisha maybe hell want that helmet  laura okay i think we learned a lot  matt and looking up at the sky it appears the sun has set which means 
tavern	 my purchased day is done  its been an absolute pleasure  laura oh but ulysses we like you so much  taliesin were looking forward to seeing you again to the inn  laura where do you stay  matt well it appears that our business transaction has come to an end if you would like  to rent another day id be happy to answer your questions  travis shittiest pay phone ever  sam well come see us at the leaky tap and maybe well hire you tomorrow morning  laura thats true  matt he leans 
none	 forward to you with a closer look he goes maybe  sam i have extreme syphilis  matt make a deception check  sam one  matt the fact that that was your lie scares him more than believing it couldve ever done he  goes very well enjoy your stay at the leaky tap ill be on my way he throws his hood up and  darts back out into the rain  laura oh man i liked him im almost sad that we didnt believe him at first  sam was he trustworthy  taliesin no  liam 
none	 i mean no hes not trustworthy but we are birds of a feather  taliesin dont trust trusting people theyre just the worst  laura he was trustworthy enough that he wasnt going to you know  taliesin no i have full faith in untrustworthy people  liam yes he was predictably a shit just as we are  laura i forgot to ask him about bakeries so i am going to keep an eye out for them  sam i will aid her in that search  matt okay you guys are making your way towards the east outersteads 
tavern	  laura would we be passing through the pentamarket on the way to the leaky tavern  matt youd have to curve around to do that do you want to  marisha do things shut down in an hour here  matt you dont know well youve been here  marisha ive been here  matt you havent spent a lot of time in zadash in fact probably the last thing you did before  your family said come home was here you know it a little bit youve been to the pentamarket  you would be able to guide 
none	 the rest of them through the pentamarket if you wanted to  marisha do i know that it stays do they keep later hours  matt yeah some of them do some of them dont some merchants prefer to use the night for revelry  and spending some of what they made for the day some know that those who drink and revel sometimes  make poor choices in their purchases so it can vary  laura we can sleep first and then get settled into the leaky tap and then sell our shit tomorrow  marisha id like to 
none	 say maybe selling our shit now that way it doesnt get robbed in the night  laura either way  travis im inclined to agree actually the longer we keep it out here the more eyes will be  on it  laura all right  marisha i think the pentamarkets that way ive got a hunch we can just slide by and see small detour  travis might be no one home  matt as you guys wander through the cold rain making your way aside from you perhaps this is  the largest city any of you have 
town	 visited comparable to port damali but much taller damali  was a little more spread out this has architecture and buildings that are designed to  rise and almost seem to curve when youre looking up at it in certain moments if youre not  careful it can give a hint of vertigo just at the height of some of these structures  marisha like new york compared to la  matt yeah thats a good way to put it rexxentrum is still easily twice the size of this  city as you make your way outside of the pentamarket 
town	 and its called this because central  to zadash a number of the streets that bisect it naturally carved a pentagonal shape and the  interior between all these streets has since become the center of most merchant business and  theres a bazaar set up in the center of that pentashape where carts and tents and buildings  are out there all day every day its an open market as youre making your way through the  rain some of them are closing early some of them are closing up because of the weather and its  not going 
none	 as well as most days would when it isnt so freezing you can see your breath escaping from  you with each exhale you ask around a bit make an investigation check as youre guiding the troupe  marisha okay 13 plus four is 17  matt easy enough you ask around you see a few folks that seem to be locals or at least who  often find their way through this district they lead you over towards a large building of stained  wood and greengold velvet hanging on the outside the first thought is that velvets going 
none	 to get  ruined in this rain as you approach the exterior of it the building is untouched it is dry you  do glance up and you can see carved delicately into a wood placard above the doors which are  currently closed but little slips of glass in each door reveal a warm lit interior thats  glowing from the inside out it says the invulnerable vagrant  marisha caleb i think this is going to be where youre going to stock up on your incense and some  other goodies  liam yes yes i wont be 
none	 long excuse me and i just push in  taliesin im going to find mulled wine its cold and i want to be warm  marisha ill join in that  laura i want to try to sell the glaive here if its magic if they sell magical weapons at this place  matt okay whos entering  travis ill go in too  marisha ill wait back  sam ill go in as well  matt you guys staying out  taliesin well watch the cart and were going to take the cart to find some mulled wine  
none	 matt okay as you enter the interior of the building its warm its very warm and its a  nice change of pace you immediately throw your cloak back as the temperature shift causes you   everyone but you actually youre pretty comfortable in the cold to immediately throw  your heavy layers back on the immediate entry you can see theres lanterns all throughout the  chamber that are hanging up above flickering candlelight but they all flicker like theres  wind when theres none you also notice that all of them are floating theyre little glass  
none	 chambers that contain the candle and theyre all slowly gyrating held in place inside the chamber  you can see a long table that has a few small books laid out on a velvet raised platform  theres a long blade like a rapier of some kind it looks jeweled and gorgeous in the back there  appears to be a shelf with books and books and books with a desk you see three figures two of  which are facing away behind the desk the one that is closest to you turns around to make your  appearance you 
none	 see a large sevenfoot tall humanoid figure short bushy curly brown hair  fros up a little bit the body is very fine grayish brown fur and their nose is wide almost  like a cow or a bulls nose across a human face the chins a bit square and the physicality is  hunched and theres just a big smile on the face  liam im sorry yes ive not been in this big a city in a while  matt make a nature check  liam yeah 20  matt you have not encountered this folk before in 
none	 your travels its rare to see them ingrained in  society this close firbolgs  marisha and laura firbolgs  liam yeah firbolgs  matt yeah they are usually a more naturebased freespirited people that live more towards the  mountains of the northern forests in the greying wildlands and beyond to see one here in society  catches you offguard let alone one thats dressed so well you can see these long elegant  robes of deep green and gold and this big smile on his face as he spins around yes im happy to  help you  
none	 liam dm sorry before i engage in this you say ive never encountered these but ive read a lot  matt yeah you know of them  liam i know of them this is my first encounter  matt yeah  travis dive in  liam hello wow look at those horns im so sorry you know i have never forget it i am  looking for  i have been in the woods for so long im so happy to be in a metropolis again i need ink  matt before we can get to that i just have 
none	 to say youre respectfully terribly filthy and  this is an establishment that i have to insist requires some more cleanliness as he waves his  hand in front of you you watch as all the dirt on your coat just begins to sift away your clothing  becomes clean right up the front of you reaching up towards your neck the dirt begins to fleck  away across your face  liam im tilting im arching my face  matt as you fight it a moment passes and you see before you for the first time since youve met 
none	 a  sparkly clean caleb  sam caleb what have you done to him what have you done to caleb  matt oh youre just an excitable little friend there arent you this giant hand goes down and  pats you on the head  sam ah its gentle  liam i dont see i have no idea  laura caleb youre beautiful  matt at this point the two other figures in the back turn around and its the same guy  liam and sam what  matt theres two more of the same firbolg the same outfit same

none	 sol and the third one goes i myself am also enchanter pumat sol  liam first question that i have for you pumats  matt the fourth ones in the back  liam pumat sol is there one of you and this is fun and games or you are  matt theres the prime pumat sol and the three of us are what you would call magically manifested  duplicates to aid in his work  liam understood well i only came here for business so  matt well welcome to the establishment the invulnerable vagrant greets all of you 
none	 humbly  liam i am finding it very hard to concentrate at the moment but i know that i need paper and the  most expensive ink you have  matt oh we have both of those things come with me he turns around and you can see now as he  turns around his head is about to smack into one of these candles and he just knowing where it  is hes been so practiced he just ducks under it and continues walking toward the back he needs  some oh i heard him he turns around and 
none	 takes down a couple of inkwells and sets them in  front the other one is pulling out stacks of paper and parchment and is stacking them up and  they set them there all right so how much do you need of how much of each  liam you know  marisha this guys our new gilmore you guys  liam i am not seducing this person  matt you say this now  liam touch√©  marisha five hundred hours later were fighting gods with him  liam i need your most fine arcane ink and i also 
none	 need your finest paper i need about 150 gold  worth of materials is that too much to ask  matt no thats comparably respectfully a paltry sum we can get that paper to you when you  say ink i have to specify do you want ink thats used in the ritualistic design and presentation of  arcane symbols scribes and glyphs or you looking for ink that itself is actually enchanted  for various uses and manifestation  liam no i pull two scrolls out of my pack i have these i found them in my journeys and 
none	 i want  to make them a part of my repertoire  matt oh thats some wizard stuff okay we can do that  laughter  matt he goes ahead and they muster the paper and ink that will easily be utilized for scribing  liam matt i love you so much  laughter  taliesin so glad were not really outside were only physically outside we get to be at the  table and its so nice  travis enchanter pumat sol do you have any health potions we might be able to acquire from you  matt we 
none	 have a few in stock actually you want to and hes like im already on it then he  turns around and pulls out a large eight vial collecting case that he sets on the table thats  one there and theres another weve got a variety of vials at your disposal so let us know  what youre looking for  travis how much would a greater healing potion run me  matt that lets see here that would put you back about 200 gold pieces for a single vial  travis how about one of the more basic 
none	 healing potions  matt a general  travis a general yes  matt thatll put you at a simple 50 gold pieces  travis ill take one of those  matt it would be my pleasure mr green man  sam i think ill buy  matt whats your name by the way  travis fjord  matt fjord pleasure to meet you  travis nice to meet you  matt im sorry i didnt mean to disrespect your invitation there whats your name  sam im nott im just nott hi nice to meet you  matt nice to

none	 on how much you want to pay for it  matt well lets go ahead and clear off he takes the vials off the counter and they set a  space and the three of them sit around you hear this voice behind this thick curtain go is  anybody able to help me here for a minute right there the two of you continue this one of them  goes in the back room to help the fourth one  laura does the fourth one look just like you  marisha theres a fourth  laura yeah theres four

none	 is pretty well made for being such a ghastlylooking design i think it could easily  use some fine gold gilding maybe some extra polishing put some ribbons on it and this thing  would be a great ceremonial piece the manticore spines i think are a little garish personally  but if youre looking to sell we could give this to you for about 300 gold  liam insight check  matt go for it  liam that is a 17  all ooh  sam what are you insighting  laura to see if hes  marisha giving 
none	 a good deal  liam i looked at the paper motherfucker  taliesin whispering im going to kill you  marisha whispering seven days  laura i feel like this guys a good guy  sam you just died  liam yeah i have to make a new character guys im sorry  laura what do you think caleb  liam i think that hes just dealing with used items  laura i dont know what that means  liam you could work him for a little bit not a lot  matt mind you if were doing it for

none	 onto it  theres two side pouches on it beyond the big central one he opens it up takes the glaive  and watch this and it disappears into it he reaches in pulls the glaive out  laura whoa thats pretty cool  sam that looks like the thing that we need  matt it sticks in there the big central pouch he goes the side ones dont carry as much but  the central side of it does manage to carry about eight cubic feet of material in an  extradimensional space to call it whenever you require 
none	 it two cubic feet for both of the side  pouches i enchanted it well he enchanted it we sell it  laura if we make this deal does it come with a regular healing potion inside of it maybe  matt make a persuasion check  marisha regular potion regular potion  liam come on la  sam i mean thats cocked a little bit  laura it is a little cocked but barely cocked ten  matt i appreciate your gusto were perhaps we had more of a business relationship together i  would consider such a deal

none	 make it prettier for us  matt give me just a moment he turns around and disappears behind the curtain and you hear some  talking some inaudible conversation another one emerges from behind the curtain who has this  leather band on his head with this large magnifyingtype tool hanging in front of him with  this big smile on his face he has these thick leather gloves that have a bunch of runes on them  he goes im sorry i was summoned to make something prettier  laura id really like you know pretty im going to 
none	 be carrying it id like it to match my outfit  matt whats your favorite color  laura pink  matt arcane incantation he finishes and he watches the haversack suddenly shimmers past and  the dull general brown leather turns to a bright vibrant pink  laura ah its beautiful 200 gold here you go  matt you hand it to the one guy who accepts it all right good i hope you enjoy it im going  to get back to work keep it up me he goes in the back room he takes the glaive off the

none	 of whatever sort of work theyre doing inside with the anvil  the rain begins to let up a little bit its still sprinkling but at least the heavy downpour has  subsided a bit you make your way through the slushy mud pits that the streets have become  weaving your way between horses and various wagons being pulled through individuals that are hooded  and bundled making their way around eventually discovering the outskirts of the leaky tap as you  guys step into the warm interior pulling your hoods back well pick up on that next week
