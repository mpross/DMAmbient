and dive into this week’s episode of critical role  spooky ethereal music  heavy breathing  roaring  dramatic music  gun firing  dramatic music  crackling flames  matt welcome back  so last we left off vox machina having returned to vasselheim  in which vax and to a lesser extent percy  had their own encounters with the raven queen  vax found seemingly /none/ some catharsis and purpose  to his currentlydeemed champion position with the raven queen  percy discovered he’s been broken all along  and left slightly slapped in the nuts  but such is the nature of your journey  but you also crafted a metal claw hand for an ally  but as you guys finish up your business in vasselheim  you made your way back to whitestone  while in whitestone you met up with some old friends  had dinner with allura kima the realmseer gilmore  you guys discussed all the things that you needed /none/ to do in the future  some information had been acquired from some of the vestiges  as well as the nature  of some of the dragons of the conclave  and some discussion was had on the overall purpose  of this recent incursion of dragon destruction  after which you all went to bed  while resting midnight a visit from gilmore to vaxs room  after some oil prankery  was beset upon each other  via grog and vax  gilmore gifted a fine silk robe to vax  and requested his presence to discuss /none/ time that has passed  upon changing into the robe  you guys made your way down the hallway up the stairs  to one of the high balconies of the west tower of whitestone  upon which gilmore turned seemingly in some serious displeasure  and stabbed you with a dagger you had not seen was there  as the pain set in you realized  perhaps this is not the gilmore you recall  but a shapeshifting tigerlike devil entity  that you may have pissed off some time in the past  liam is it a sports /none/ mascot its a sports mascot  marisha and taliesin theyre grrreat  matt thats not sports travis wow  all laugh  matt not that id know  anyway lets go ahead and jump in this moment  as the rest of the party is sleeping soundly  i would like you vaxildan   sam i am not sleeping matt youre not sleeping  sam remember i said i was staying up to read my book  matt to read your book youre right you are totally right  well im going to have you roll initiative if you /none/ dont mind  liam i have a lot of interesting ideas  that will go out the window depending on this roll possibly  travis were all watching  liam i dont like his reaction im going to use luck  i have two lucks left im going to use one of them  groans it was on 18 and went down no 16  matt 16 all righty  liam oh well it was going to be really interesting  matt i can only imagine  all laugh  travis shit matt sorry  travis thug life glasses come /none/ down joint comes up  matt i didnt mean for it to come off that way it just   travis bubububublam gutshot  all laugh  sam play ding dong  liam it went 18 it hung like a half second 4  matt as the surprise round has faded  the gilmorelike entity draws the blade out of your abdomen  snarls towards you  and the round begins with the initiative on the rakshasa  marisha groans travis you got this youre fine  sam wait refresh us all is liam  im sorry  is vax /none/ naked  matt no vax is wearing a long silk robe   matt  and his boots sam and what underneath  matt and thats it sam so hes naked  liam im wearing my boots because its cold  i wouldnt go walking barefoot  matt boots are a given everything else left behind  sam no armor no weapons laura remember he was in his pajamas  and gilmore was like  put this on i made this for you  liam why wouldnt any of us trust gilmore or matthew  matt im just telling a /none/ story yo speaking of stories   sam but wait the robe has like a rope tie to tie  sam you can use that for something liam shush  matt you’re reading your book  so as it draws the blade back it goes in for a claw towards the face  liam uncanny dodge  matt hold on to see if i hit you first liam oh okay  matt chuckles because that is going to be a  matt 13 to hit your ac is 15 liam misses  matt the claw whoosh  you duck underneath /none/ as it spins around with the dagger  and hits you from the other side as you come up from that  matt that will be a 19 and does hit you liam funny voice uncanny dodge  matt you suffer 5 points of piercing damage  as the dagger just barely sssh cuts across your face  you can feel the little line of blood begin to spill down your chin  as you hear the growl under the breath again  i will send you to a place youll never return from growls  and is actually going /none/ to stay right there youre up  liam now i can do my crazyass shit so out of instinct  the heels click together the boots go on the world slows down as i speed up  and in that split second in a millisecond i think  hes gone to all this trouble to get me here  the door behind me could very well be locked  also he knows everything he knows about whitestone  if he leaves he can tell the conclave  and if i run hes gone  so instead hes right in front /none/ of me yeah  okay i would like to grapple him  matt okay all right go ahead and make an athletics check  liam okay  last luck of the day 14  matt 16  you attempt to grapple  and as soon as your arms reach around the rakshasa  hotis breaks away  liam okay thats action number 1  action number 2 id like to grapple him

you make out  the first word was enough to just shake you awake  and youre not quite sure what that word was  but you hear “west tower jenga” and you get the gist of that  you however did hear the full phrase  as you look around you  percy keyleth and pike  sam oh shit matt you arent alone in your room  travis laughing gasp  matt as climbing through the window or in percys   sam ninjas  matt  had come in through the hallway you see   taliesin /none/ and marisha ninjas  matt  cloaked individuals blades drawn up in the air  about to come down onto your asleep forms  as you suddenly look up

travis all 3 or everybody else laura everybody  matt everybody  marisha oh my god ooh thats not bad  travis have advantage taliesin thatll do  travis 18  /none/ ashley 8  travis laura and matt chuckle

 so there is the one that is up against keyleth right now  is going to make two short sword attacks on you  marisha aw he beat me  matt yep well this is  as you guys wake up  you see them there and theyre finishing their combat /none/ round  so thats going to be a 19 to hit  marisha hits  matt that hits  okay you take 9 points of piercing damage  and make a constitution saving throw  ashley and laura oh god travis shit  marisha that cant be good okay  taliesin wordless noise of approval marisha 20 total  matt okay you take 12 points of poison damage  ashley with  marisha on top of i had 9 originally matt mmhm  marisha right matt yep  marisha okay so thats  matt the second strike is going to /none/ be another 19 rolled 12 again  you take another 9 points of piercing damage  and i need you to make another constitution saving throw  laura this is so much worse than i thought it was  taliesin goddamn it  marisha i rolled a natural 19 so 24  matt you take another 12 points of poison damage  sam how many points  taliesin wow thats the good reaction apparently  marisha jesus fuck he just did 42 points of damage  ashley what marisha in one round yeah  travis fourtwo four marisha 42  /none/ matt so the one thats there before you percy  as youre just sitting up out of your bed  thats going to be an  oh thats a natural 17  24 to hit  taliesin if i have an ac of 24 am i fine or no  i mean an ac of 24  never mind it hits  matt it still hits you and and this is assuming also  the fact that that you guys were sleeping and not in your full armor either  taliesin no no that hits  no actually  yeah /none/ i cant do that can i fuck  matt thats 8 points  of piercing damage to you  taliesin sighing yeah  matt i need you to make a constitution saving throw  taliesin all right dont be stupid  oh stupid thats a natural 1 thats what it is  matt you suffer 24 points of poison damage  as whereas you manage to shrug off the effects  percy you feel as the short sword strikes across your flesh  the wound thats left open in the front of your long johns  suddenly begins to burn /none/  and feels like its singeing whitehot fire  like an iron just out of the forge has been pressed into your chest  the second strike rolls a natural 2 its going to be a 9  taliesin nope that does not hit  matt this time you actually duck out of the bed  as it slams down on the wood cutting into the side of the bed frame  ending that guys round  thats going to bring us to the one that is against you pike  ashley okay  matt so pike  ashley yes /none/  matt first strike on you thats going to be a 20 to hit  ashley chuckles just hits  matt though not wearing your armor at this point in time  laura how do we know what our ac is  ashley so what are we then  matt your ac would be just 10 plus your dexterity modifier  ashley so its 11 so that hits  matt 11 yeah you suffer 5 points of piercing damage  and i need you to make a constitution saving throw  ashley okay  20  matt all right yeah /none/  so you take 12 points of poison damage  and that is going to be 10 so that misses you  ashley great  matt yeah so you take  an additional 12 points of poison damage from the last strike  ashley so 5 plus 12  matt correct 17 total  and the second strike goes to hit you and you actually reach over  grab your shield which is sitting on the table by your bed  and just ping knock the blade nearly out of his hand  but deflecting the blow  that brings /none/ us to the top of the initiative round now  you guys are all conscious  some of you are aware of the danger youre currently in  percy youre up first what are you doing  taliesin i do keep my small pistol under my pillow  matt of course you do laughs yes you would percy  taliesin i dont have access in theory to the big gun the sword  which are under the bed and that would require a thing  and i also dont have access  to any of the things i could use /none/ to reload it  but i do have four shots  matt you do taliesin okay wheres my room  matt your room is right here  taliesin i dont have a window do i  matt no you do not have a window your room is on the inside  travis what floor are we on  matt you guys are on the second major floor of the castle  the west tower as you know is up this way  the staircase leads up and then spirals up to the west tower  sam do we know how /none/ far  matt you havent  youve maybe explored there a few times  its between 60 to 70 feet up  sam weve not been there were not familiar with it  matt percy would be pretty familiar with it  taliesin yeah i would  matt you guys may have gone there here and there  taliesin youve seen it its not that big a castle to be honest  marisha so there are windows that they came through  they came in the windows  matt these two came in the windows  this one youre not /dung/ sure may have come in through other means  or through another window  marisha who are you pointing at percys matt the one thats in percys room  marisha but we have windows matt right  marisha that are open to the outside matt yes  taliesin is mine standing against the door  matt currently yes  taliesin im going to try and shoot him through the door  to see if i can blow him out of my room  taliesin with trick shot so matt okay  taliesin trick shot to blow him out of the /none/ room  lets lets yeah no  im not adding a sharpshooter for that fuck that first shot  oh god im nervous high pitched voice thatll do  its 22  matt yeah thatll hit  theyre only wearing studded leather  taliesin okay good enough  matt and theyre caught off guard at how suddenly everyone  or at least you were suddenly conscious  he was so quiet he was so quiet  and yet you still got there before he could stab you  taliesin okay and thats got an auto push i think  or /none/ do i have to roll for push  matt i believe  taliesin strength saving throw  matt yeah that is going to be a 5 plus 0 none no  so how much damage is that total  taliesin that does sorry i was not prepared  i thought i was going to watch a fight  matt chuckles  taliesin i was really prepared for that  thats 11 points of piercing damage  matt all right and pushes him how far back  taliesin once how many squares thats a good question  thats 10 feet directly /none/ away  matt thwoosh it pushes him out through the door  you guys hear this muffled pshew gunshot in the distance  and this slamming sound of a heavy wooden door hitting stone  percy as you watch as boof hes blown through the doorway  landing into the hallway on his back  and jumps back to his feet just in time with his blade still out in front of him  taliesin im going to take two more shots on him  the next shot is a sharpshooter shot  matt okay  taliesin 5 to hit /none/  yeah no thats a 13  matt 13 as you aim this time and fire for a second time pshew  he does see it coming and ducks out of the way  as it just scoots under his hood  avoiding his head and leaving a hole in the fabric  and then kssh taking a chunk out of the stone in the wall behind him  taliesin okay final shot is   im using the head shot to try and blind him for a round so  matt okay  taliesin thats no sharpshooter because that /none/ sucked  thats better 28 to hit  matt thatll do go ahead and roll damage  taliesin he needs to roll a constitution saving throw  matt he rolls a 20 total  taliesin and thats against  i just rolled so terribly  20 its a 19 dc  so unless that changes with my new intelligence  matt yeah so it doesnt  it isnt affected by   taliesin he just takes 7 points of damage  matt it was sharpshooter wasnt it its a 10  taliesin what  no that wasnt sharpshooter i just /none/ did the middle one sharpshooter  matt gotcha okay 7 points piercing damage on that  pshew while the first hit managed to miss his face  this one does whoosh scrape across his chin  and cracks a bit of his cheekbone  but not too much of an impact on him to actually affect his eyesight  taliesin im going to use my movement and bonus  to grab at least some of the stuff thats under my bed  some of my things and start to put myself together  and steady myself and i’ll start yelling /none/ bloody murder  matt okay you guys at this point start hearing the distant echo  of percys voice screaming in the distance  taliesin intruders intruders  matt at the end of percys turn that now brings us back  to the rakshasa which is narrowed down  takes the dagger and as a bonus dips it back into the sheath  pulling it out with the liquid trailing off of it  its going to go in and attempt to claw and strike  ashley no  matt thats going to be a 23 with the claw  /none/ liam yep  matt you take 10 points of slashing damage  liam where did my thing go laura here take it im sorry  liam okay  matt and then the dagger  is also going to be thrust back at you as it moves this way  getting between you and the door  that strike is going to be a 21 to hit  liam yeah  matt all right this time with the dagger  thats going to be 4 plus thats going to be  liam uncanny dodge on it  matt 7 points of /none/ piercing damage  and then i need you to make a constitution saving throw  liam 20 natural 20 laura happy grunting noise  everyone but matt and liam groans in relief  liam there was some damage though it was what  matt an additional 7 points of poison damage  you used uncanny dodge on this that all gets reduced to just 7 total  liam i did use uncanny dodge  matt so it wouldve been 14 total you take it down to 7  liam i lost track of what was what  matt sorry 7 /none/ points of piercing and 7 points of poison  together would be 14 your uncanny dodge brings it down to 7  so you just take 7 points of damage that round  liam okay  matt all right that will end hotiss turn  that brings us to scanlan  sam okay ill use i guess some movement  to gather my belongings and anything that i dont still have on  matt i mean everything that you have would also include your armor  which you cant really put on right now  it would take you about /none/ a minute to put it on  as it is leather armor  but you can grab everything else if you wanted to  or you could carry your armor awkwardly with you  sam ill just grab a couple of instruments  matt okay grabbing sound you gather some things  sam and go ill grab the shawm and the mythcarver  matt okay grabbing noises  sam and if ive ever been up there  im going to try to dimension door to the west tower  matt okay all righty  sam i dont know if im /none/ familiar enough with it  but ill give it a shot  matt all right you wouldve walked  through the castle at some point in the past  you grab your things  ashley ive been there with you  sam what did we do up there travis made out  ashley like just so much stuff there so weve totally been there  travis under the moonlight  sam did you have hickies afterward or something  sam and travis laugh  sam oh it worked  matt at the distance it is at that point  and /none/ plus the fact that you have been there before  you concentrate  you remember a few nights you walked up there  to look over the grounds because its a beautiful view  and its close to where you guys usually stay here in the castle  zoopf you come out of the dimension door  and looking before you  you can see gilmore holding a dagger out to one side  and vax bleeding  holding and clutching the front of his abdomen  eyes darting around wildly  trying to think of some sort of plan /none/ for survival  so thats your action thats most of your movement  sam thats  i mean thats pretty much all ive got  i imagine i would be pretty confused so   matt yeah youre taking in the circumstances  sam i will probably just if i have any time left ill just say  what the fuck is going on gilmore  and thats it  matt the gilmore looks over his shoulder and sneers at you hissing growl  sam oh shit  all laugh  matt grog youre up  travis i spring out /none/ of my bed because i dont sleep with any armor on  i got all me bits on me  and i grab my axe and i kick the door open  matt boof  travis because i know jenga its one of my favorite words im like  wordless aggressive sounds  is there anybody in the hallway  matt theres nobody in the hallway  laura no no no i thought the gunman was in the hallway  matt hmm laura percys gunman was in the hallway  matt grog is sleeping in this side of the hallway /none/  laura oh shit taliesin oh  travis where are the stairs matt around that way  travis fucking shit  so i start tearing down the hallway as far as me little legs can carry me  matt about there if you want to take a dash  travis ill dash  matt thats your movement and your dash your action  you get to there as you come around  and see a guy in full black cloak and some bullets tssh flying by  shattering the stonework behind  and then you see this humanoid character  /none/ holding a short sword at his side growling  he sees you looming down the hallway and his eyes go wide for a moment  unexpected to see this giant train of a muscled entity charging down  travis and the dash was my bonus action right  matt no the dash is your action  travis so i have a bonus  matt you have a bonus yes  travis can i look down and say  hello muppet  and i would like to rage  all laugh  matt all

marisha how far away from the window like is his back up against the window  matt like  like basically just stepped out of the window  and you were immediately next to it so the window is right to his left  as hes staring down at you with a blade in the air  marisha its an open window matt yes /none/  marisha bars on it or something laura he came in  matt it looks like the window  is easy enough for somebody to slip through  its an open window  marisha okay  taliesin its a nice neighborhood theres no bars on the windows  marisha im trying to think which way i want to go with this  matt make it quick  marisha im going to towards him do a thunderwave push boof  and try and push him out the window thunderwave  matt so youre going to move around him first  marisha /none/ oh does he have me up against the window  matt youre up against the wall if you want to thunderwave him  youd have to get on the other side of him  to knock him away from you  marisha and hell get an attack of opportunity im assuming  matt no because you dont leave his combat  marisha oh okay yeah ill just shoulder around him  matt you dart off the edge of the bed catching yourself on the ground  turn around the other side and boof  whats the dc on that  /none/ marisha jesus i dont know i dont do this very often  matt singsong dc of thunderwave vax youre up next prepare  marisha it is a constitution saving throw  matt and whats your spell dc  marisha 19  matt that is a 9  2 11 thats not enough  how much damage does he take  marisha he takes 2d8 damage and he is pushed 10 feet  matt

to throw open the door  and just peek out the door and see whats up  matt okay you throw the door open immediately out  you see grog standing in the hallway clutching the axe  kind of sleepyeyed but filled with hatred and intent to kill  while grinning in the /none/ center of the hallway  marisha and then i’m going to come over my comm and just say  status report where is everybody  and that’s it  matt okay after keyleths turn that brings us to vax  liam i can’t see through the corner of the wall there  is scanlan like 10 feet away 5 feet away  matt scanlan is 10 feet from you  liam all right  i’m going to skirt along on his side the rakshasa’s side and shout out  it’s not gilmore it’s a fucking demon  at scanlan and /none/ then  i’m going to use my first action to try to disarm kittycat  marisha meow matt okay all right  liam what is that travis disarm him  matt go ahead and make go ahead and make an attack roll   or no for this one let’s make an athletics check to try  it’s essentially a type of grapple  liam all right  uh 16  matt 16  okay you reach out  and manage to grab the gilmore’s wrist holding the dagger  his arm goes up and starts clawing these fingernails  /none/ these currently notevenvisible fingernails  that all of a sudden turn into these large hooks  that start tearing into your skin  go ahead and make a strength check  to see if you can wrestle the blade from his grasp  liam and this is the next action  matt this would be the next action yeah  since you don’t have any disarmbased abilities  this is a more involved   liam 15 that’s still acrobatics right  matt no no no this  liam what’d you say  matt this is all athletics  liam /none/ this is athletics same thing sorry yeah 15  matt yeah 15 liam 15  matt you still have the grip on him but unfortunately his fingers  are too tight on the blade and you can’t quite pull it out  liam okay then for the rest of my turn  i whip my head to scanlan say  follow me down i’m going down  and i want to drag him off the balcony and go with him  matt okay you can drag him at halfspeed   liam halfspeed i’m hasted matt hasted  liam 12 /none/ squares full matt fwwsh  all shout  matt you watch sam as he grabs  this apparently gilmore character looks at you tells you this  and then they both just hit the edge  and tumble over the side of the balcony  and go falling off  liam this takes two seconds to go down i looked it up 80 feet is two seconds  matt yep whoosh whoosh boomf you hear two impacts  sam but i just got here don’t leave  matt both you and hotis  36 points of damage as you both /none/ boomf  hit the bottom this stone surface essentially the ceiling  and the beginnings of the entire castle here on the top  both prone on the ground dazed from the impact  liam really hoping the guards are awake laura really hoping  matt all righty ending your turn that brings us to the assassins so   ashley but we didn’t  laura but we didn’t get to go  laura do assassins get to go twice  matt no you guys go after them  because that was how the initiative order happened  laura biting /none/ noise  travis yep liam that was 3 points of damage  matt him yelling and waking you guys up  avoided them getting an autocrit on their first attack  laura oh shit travis oh god  matt so be happy that at least you woke up for the last round  laura that’s good that’s good ashley i’m happy i’m happy  taliesin thank you matt liam so happy happy  matt happy travis thanks matt  matt so that’s two strikes against you pike  and then this one here  looks over the shoulder and sees /none/ you grog  and is going to start darting this way  and currently is out of sight  marisha the assassin doucher matt yep  matt the one that’s attacking you pike   liam i assume what i said to scanlan was heard over earring as well  matt most likely yeah that’ll be a 22  ashley well yes  all laugh  matt you take 7 points of piercing damage  and roll another constitution saving throw  ashley 7 points matt yep  ashley okay that’s fine 7 points  matt and roll a constitution /none/ saving throw when you can  the second strike this time you slam his hand with the shield  and you can see he actually drops the blade  and has to rush over to pick it up  ashley 13  matt 13 you suffer 24 points of poison damage  as the first strike this time  cuts you right across the clavicle and down to the front of your chest  and it’s just that sharp burning pain for a second  and as you knock the other hit away all of a sudden you feel the /none/ oomf oomf  your ears fill with bright burninghot warmth  and all of sudden the pain from your wound  begins to pulse with every heartbeat as the poison hits your system  ashley nice okay  matt and he’s going to move this way  to start getting between you and the doorway  that’s going to end their turns vex you’re up  laura okay i’m going to get up  i’m going to yell at trinket to run out the door  and i’m going to grab my arrows and my quiver and my broom  /none/ matt trinket’s going into a full  we’ll say he can do a full dash  laura can he get to the guy  matt he’s gotten that far up the hallway  he doesn’t see anybody yet  you grab your stuff all right  that’ll be an action to get all of your things together  laura okay matt your quiver your arrows…  laura the broom matt the broom  laura and i take off running to the west tower  so we don’t

bolt him  matt okay laura take out your hand  travis i’m going to take out my hand ashley my trusty old hand  matt the wound across your chest with the pulsing poison  suddenly the area that was once dark begins to light up  as the holy symbol that forever hangs around your neck  begins to glow with vibrant divine energy  this whitishyellow pulse /none/ of light  the assassin standing there grinning seeing that he’s getting the upper hand  all of a sudden realizes  that you aren’t as disarmed as he thought you were  go ahead and roll for the attack on this  travis smoke him  ashley 28  matt that’ll hit go ahead and roll damage on that  what level were you casting it at  ashley i’m going to do it at 4  matt usually you decide that before you roll the attack but yeah  ashley okay travis puddins pike  ashley i was /none/ going to that’s what i was going to do  matt i assumed you were that’s fine  ashley but i didn’t tell you that how many do i roll  hold on hold on hold on  matt let me look it up for you guiding bolt is 4d6   ashley 7 right  matt  and then it would be an additional 3d6  for 7d6 radiant damage against him  ashley yeah 7 okay okay so  travis yep 8 ashley 8  travis 11 19  travis 7 26 laura one more  ashley what /none/ was it travis 27  ashley 27 points  matt 27 points nice  you see his eyes widen  as suddenly you blast him in the face with this guiding bolt  the impact just boof bursting across him  leaving this trail of divine fire  that’s burning around the seams of his leather armor  he’s trying to pat it out but it won’t go out  while it’s not burning him  it’s lighting him up like a christmas tree  and grog you see  from underneath pike’s door  you see a little bit /dung/ of a bright divine glow  flash out from under the door  and you hear a couple thumps against the wood from inside the room  travis and that’s her the one to the right of me  laura yeah which ones are everybody’s rooms  matt this is vex’s room keyleth’s pike’s percy   sam the one that smells like patchouli is mine  matt yeah scanlan’s and grog’s and vax’s were over here  laura okay  ashley so can i move out of the room  matt you can try to yeah  ashley i /none/

not going to get armor though  ashley i’ll grab my mace matt so you grab your mace all right  liam you’re in a slip or nothing so  ashley i sleep naked travis thatta girl  sam so you’re naked with a shield and a mace  travis that’s a bad bitch laura hell /none/ yeah she is  liam monster  matt shield mace holy symbol  ashley do i have my gauntlets on or no  matt nothing else yeah your gauntlets are on  ashley okay  matt we’ll say the gauntlets were there you slip them on real fast  as he’s pulled back and trying to pat out the flames  you grab your things and rush through  he does get an attack of opportunity on you  as you run out of his combat range so he’s going to swing at you  matt that is going to /none/ be a 16 ashley yeah  matt that does hit  with your shield what’s your ac it would be 1113 so yeah it still hits  so you take 5 points of piercing damage  i need you to roll another constitution saving throw  sam man pikey  ashley that is a 5  matt you take another 24 of poison damage  sam oh my gosh she going to die laura oh no  ashley no no no i don’t think i’m uncon  wait 24 points  ashley i got one hit point left  sam /none/ how did that happen so fast laura she

out in the hallway naked with a mace and a shield  matt naked with a mace and shield glowing holy symbol  and just gash across her chest blood pouring from the wound  laura oh pike  matt sweat on her brow one eye’s halfclosed  matt she’s barely /none/ standing sam and weirdly hairy shoulders  all laugh  liam that’s why i never take the armor off guys  marisha no  ashley and hairy chest just full hairy chest  matt ending pike’s turn sam oh god i never knew  matt percy you’re up liam still love me scanlan  taliesin i’m going to run out of my  i’m grabbing just the basics  gloves and the gunbelt and my gun stuff no armor  sam gun stuff  taliesin no amulet running out in the front what do i   matt amulet you /none/ would probably   you don’t need to take that off to sleep so i’ll let you have that  taliesin okay so fine i’ll just have that  all right so no armor so  taliesin which direction is the west matt this way  taliesin it’s this way and do i see any i don’t see what   matt you don’t see anyone  you just see pike burst out of her room suddenly bloodied  taliesin okay i’m going to run past her room towards the west  and do i have a view right there /none/  matt you now have a view of a guy beaming with divine light  trying to pat out divine flames after swinging  and getting a nice heavy wound on pike who looks like she’s barely standing  taliesin okay i’m going to take a couple   liam fuck him up fuck him up travis if he takes care of you though  taliesin i get one foot stop turn around  i draw my sword and i’m just going to go stabby on the bastard  because i haven’t reloaded my gun yet  travis that was /none/ in pike’s room taliesin yeah  travis good okay taliesin i can get there  matt this is the end of your movement  taliesin oh right there okay  then fine i’ll just unload the gun that’ll be fun  matt so you have a fourth shot  taliesin i have a fourth shot and then another one yeah  matt okay regular shot taliesin no sharpshooter  matt sharpshooter okay  you have advantage on this shot by the way  because of the guiding bolt that she did to him  sam ooh taliesin oh i do /none/  matt yeah because the divine fire that’s surrounding him  is lighting him up like a giant birthday candle  taliesin all right that’ll be 28 to hit matt that’ll hit  matt go ahead and roll damage on that one  sam hashtag gun stuff liam quentin tarantino joined  taliesin 22 points of damage liam and marisha gun stuff  matt gunshot sound the guiding bolt flares off  the impact hits him and sends him on his back foot  he looks over and sees the smoke pouring out of the barrel  as you’re aiming /dung/ down for another shot you reload real fast  taliesin taking another shot at him matt go for it  taliesin advantage matt no that was just the first one  taliesin that’s okay i still rolled really great  all laugh  ashley that’s okay i still rolled well  taliesin i was hoping for a critical but whatever  laura yeah i’m not going to need it ashley fucking nailed it  matt just wanted to check  taliesin 25 to hit  matt the dungeon master will remember this  no it’s fine so go ahead and /none/ roll damage  sharpshooter as well  taliesin yeah yeah yeah it was  24 points of damage  matt 24 points of damage  gunshot the second shot you reload fire again  this time this one hits him  right square in what looks like the side of his jaw  shattered his cheekbone and his jaw  and there’s now blood and teeth pouring out  and he’s clutching the side of it shaking his head  he’s in a really bad place right now  and is looking over the back window realizing he’s probably going /none/ to   taliesin fuck it let’s burn an action surge this’ll be funny  laura percy tastes blood  taliesin that’s 16 17 18 19 25  matt that hits  ashley get him  taliesin that’s 19 points of damage  matt with that as he’s turning around about to dart towards the window  as he spins around in his space  you take aim a second or now a third time on him fire  you watch it’s obscured to see  all you see is the moonlight from the outside sky coming through  and /none/ the silhouette of his head  and now the missing silhouette of his head   as you scatter the top half of his skull  across the stone surrounding the window in pike’s room  ashley thanks percy  taliesin i reload  ashley i had him but thanks  taliesin i drop a health potion and then steady to take care of that  and reload my guns with the rest of my turn  matt okay good to know all right ending percy’s turn  you’re currently on the ground now you’re both prone  hotis stands /none/ up using half of his movement  looks down at you  you’re clever  which for the record the illusion has faded  the gilmore visage is no more now you see before you the angry  curled bareteeth face of the familiar rakshasa  the feeling’s mutual  as you are currently  prone on the ground  it has advantage on you  its going to go ahead and  make two strikes with the dagger against you  with advantage yeah that’ll be 25  liam he didn’t redip though  i don’t remember you saying /none/ he redipped right  he used his poison last time and i made the save  matt correct liam right okay  liam so that hits uncanny dodge matt right so the first one hits  matt you take  10 points of piercing damage no poison  ashley i’m sorry i’m sorry sorry i’m nervously playing with it  liam sorry one more time matt 10 points of piercing damage  liam yes  matt he’s going to dip the blade  remembering that he forgot that after the first strike  then with the second strike he’s going /none/ to stab down once more  liam that’s just a bonus to do that  matt yeah that’s going to be a 21  you suffer 11 points of piercing damage  plus 10 points of poison damage  laura no more liam i’m unconscious  matt unconscious  so as you get up he just stabs and stabs again  and this time as your finger’s extended the pain hits you  and you just watch your vision fade to darkness  laura no  matt that’s the end of his turn  he has no more attacks so /none/ he just watches you go limp  liam for my turn i’ll be dead laura no  matt all right well scanlan you’re up first  sam i go to the ledge and look over  matt yeah you look over the ledge  down about 70 feet 80 feet on the stonework  you see and watch as the rakshasa now fully visible gilmore visage gone  jams the blade twice into the currently laidout back of vax  as the backs body goes limp unconscious  drawing the blade chuckling throwing it up in the air catching it /none/  and is preparing to go down for some finishing blows  sam okay shit my stuff doesn’t go that far does it  any of my vocal spells only goes 60   matt only about 60 feet yeah  sam yeah fuck all right well then for my actionslashattack  i overcome with fury seeing my friend on the ground  pull out mythcarver and just fucking jump and plunge  laura oh my god taliesin yes  matt okay travis yes yes yes  matt so you leap shhh   sam and i have advantage because /none/ i’ve inspired myself  all laugh  matt i’ll say for the purposes of this action  you will have advantage on the strike as   sam but i’m also exhausted  matt right but that doesn’t affect your actual attack roll  that’s more your ability check  actually you should have had disadvantage earlier for that  sam i rolled twice for that matt oh you did okay good  matt so as you come down quiet  currently overcome with the now  possibility of vengeance before it  the rakshasa does not seem to notice /none/ you  as you fall off silently blade down whoosh wind rushing past your face  the tunnelvision before you  as you can see this whole scene play out before you  the blade comes down slamming  go ahead and roll with advantage your attack against the rakshasa  sam 14 15 plus i don’t know what i don’t do these things  travis i’ve never hit sam strength is that strength  matt it should be written on your attack  it would be your proficiency bonus plus your   sam oh it’s 8 matt yeah /none/ so  sam that’s a 23 taliesin 23  matt 23 definitely hits travis nice  sam okay ashley nicely done  sam i don’t know what to do now i roll a d8  matt go ahead and roll your d8 plus damage  sam okay 8  3 so that’s 11  plus 1d6 force damage 6 holy shit  all laugh  taliesin this is happening this is happening  sam so that’s 11 that’s 17 right  matt 17 sam okay  matt i’m adding to that attack half of the damage you take from the /none/ fall  because of the force  of yourself and the blade  so the damage you take from the fall  travis i don’t know what that expression was  laura yeah i know is that good or bad both  taliesin it’s either a lot or a little  matt 29 points of damage you suffer  slamming into the ground and falling prone from the attack  but he does suffer an additional 14 points of damage  as the blade sssh just sinks into the shoulder and the torso  and he tenses in pain  /none/ as the blade is still jammed into his form  you let go of it as you slam into the ground  and he draws it out with a spurt of blood and throws it to the ground angrily  spinning around towards you  still holding the dagger aloft looking over  sam do i still get my bonus action matt you do technically yeah  sam okay so i on the ground turn over to vax  and i’ll bonus healing word him  laura oh thank god  sam and i will sing with whatever wind i /none/ have left in my body  singing vax’ildan you’re going to put up a good fight  vax’ildan i need you to put up a good fight  put up a good fight  put up a good fight  travis laughing is that roxanne sam that’s roxanne  all laugh  travis i couldn’t even join in because it was so good  liam so in love with you right now so in love with you  sam 4 i’m rolling great  plus 5 so you have 9 hit points  matt so you come back to consciousness /none/ facedown on the ground  scattered out on the stonework  and the last thing as your eyes come open  you hear the gentle tunes of scanlan’s voice  calling you back from the darkness  you glance out the corner of your eye  and see that hotis is still standing with the dagger up on top  liam it was just my turn in the initiative can i go  matt no your turn’s not yet we have grog keyleth and then you  they actually got initiative higher than you so  liam oh okay okay /none/  matt we’re coming to you don’t worry so your turn hasn’t happened yet  liam okay i totally  i trust in you matt  matt all righty liam and fear you  matt good all right that brings us to  grog you’re up  travis so i heard him say i’m going down right  we all heard him say he’s going down as he was falling  matt roll an intelligence check sam oh boy  travis this’ll be great ah 18 minus  all laugh  travis minus 2 16  matt 16 it takes /none/ you a moment  and you have to bite your tongue for a moment  as you’re running down the hallway  but you ascertain that probably means  it’s a tower probably jumped off the tower  travis yeah probably i look out and i say  oh pike you’re in your birthday suit  are you all right  ashley yeah i’m fine i’m fine i’m fine  sam she’s bleeding all over  ashley wait did i take  i took a potion on the   matt well he had the potion on the ground  /none/ taliesin i threw you a minor it’s not much  ashley i’m going to be fine i’m going to be fine  travis okay  is there a window in the hallway  my question is is the courtyard through those windows  matt the courtyard would be over here actually  travis right is there  marisha in relation to where we are  matt this is no longer really part of the deal  so in relation to where you guys are they’re about here  travis do all of the rooms have windows or is there a /none/ window in the hallway  matt all of the rooms that have windows are the ones on that side  so currently the only way to get here  would be to travel back where you came from  and find an exit out to the top of the   travis fucking ass  marisha i was going to try and handle that  taliesin do those stairs go to the west tower by the way  matt these stairs go to the west tower yes  taliesin cool just checking  travis can i hold my  turn /none/ until keyleth goes  matt all right  you can still move though if you want to  travis i will  where are you  marisha i’m right behind you in the room in the door behind you  travis yeah but i can go back in laura okay  travis i should just stay there if you’re going to make a door  marisha hey grog travis what  marisha you want to jump from really high  travis yeah i just want out  marisha all right  travis so i’ll hold until keyleth goes and i /none/ won’t move  i’ll stay there because she’s right beside   matt what action are you holding  travis i will hold my movement  matt well no i mean the movement gets used in your turn regardless  you just choose what action you want to hold as a trigger  so if something’s going to happen  you would then use whatever your action is  your movement you have to use now or it’s lost  travis i have to choose  what she’s going to do im so confused  laura well you won’t be /none/ able to move once she goes  you won’t be able to do an action because you’re trapping yourself  taliesin its like  i’m holding everything  until she makes a door  matt your impulse hit now and if you decide not to move  then the impulse loses the movement so  travis i don’t know i don’t know what to say i   sam yeah you can’t really do anything travis yeah i don’t move  marisha he’s just holding his action  travis i decide to stand still  sam yeah but just to /none/ get through this portal  he’s going to have to move it’s a whole other turn  travis otherwise i’m running down a hallway for no reason  i just don’t move  i just stand there dumbfounded that pike is naked and cut to shit  matt okay that ends grog’s turn you’re up  marisha okay i’m going to reach over put on my circlet in my nightgown  matt okay  marisha and i’m going to step out look left and right  okay and then going off what grog was saying  i’m going to walk /none/ behind grog and i’m going to do stone shape  i’m going to blast a door into that wall blast a giant hole yeah  matt all right boof as you tear this wall open there   marisha yeah dude yeah laura awesome  matt  it opens up before you  and you can see a little bit of it gets pushed to the side  because it’s a little bit elevated from the the roof area  but you force it upward  to where it bursts open and creates a slight ramp  that leads up /none/ to what would be the roof  of this part of whitestone castle  marisha okay cool and then i’ll  can i see pike from where i am  matt you can yes  marisha i’m going to look at her  and give her a healing word just a level 1 healing word  matt all right  marisha you are going to heal  ashley thanks pal  marisha oh it’s not great sorry  marisha so 7 points ashley i’ll take it  matt all right  you still have a little bit of movement if /none/ you want to use it  marisha i’ll step back a little bit out of grog’s way  matt okay there you go  marisha not that back towards you  matt okay got you  so it’d be there probably far as you can get  marisha sure yeah so he can get by  matt all right cool that brings us to vax your turn  marisha oh grog  travis no but i can’t do anything marisha you can’t do anything  marisha oh i thought he held   matt you didn’t say you were holding /none/ an action for anything  travis i wanted to move through the door once she made it  matt i’ll let you do it you’re generally not supposed to do   travis what do i say i hold a dash or a hold a movement  matt say you hold a dash  you could do that yeah  travis oh okay i would like to hold a dash  matt okay so yeah then you just go ahead and   travis we’re still learning  taliesin you can hold a dash for keyleth’s turn  taliesin and /none/ travis hold a dash for keyleth’s turn  taliesin and then she moves and then you go  travis i didn’t do my homework  matt so as keyleth opens the window you dash up and rush onto the rooftop  and there you can see across the way  marisha i give him a goodgame smack on the ass as he runs by  sam naked ass laura he’s got his normal clothes on  liam always naked taliesin he’s naked  laura we’re all naked  travis well i only sleep naked in the ladyfavors house  liam /none/ question  grabbing a weapon off the ground that’s a freebie right  is that a bonus action i feel like that’s  i think that’s free  matt as part of an action you can pick it   liam part of an action all right great  i’m going to thank the raven queen for my family  and cast lay on hands on myself take back 5 hit points  i see mythcarver on the ground  i’m going to grab it and use my movement to stand  and i also noticed that we’re flanking hotis /none/  so i’m going to sneakattack the motherfucker up the back  matt all right just as a note  the way that the bonus attack works  well this is with your haste ability  liam yeah i’m hasted the bonus action was   oh no the action right the action was the spell  matt the haste would’ve faded once you went unconscious  liam oh okay that’s okay i have one action still  matt well you have an action and then you have your offhand strike  offhand strike works as part of the attack /none/ action  if you use your action for anything else you don’t get the bonus attack  marisha so is picking something up not a free action  i thought picking up a weapon was a free action  matt it’s part of an action  don’t worry about it it’s fine let’s do it  liam i didn’t even  no no no do it the real way man  i don’t want any mulligans  matt no the idea would be  you don’t get a free bonus attack with any other action  it’s whatever you’re attacking /none/ you then get to throw this in this way  liam well let me ask you this  because if i understood that i wouldn’t have cast the spell  so i’m happy to skip the spell and then cut the   matt okay that’s fine we’ll do that  as part of the action economy  the idea is that because you’re attacking with one  you can give yourself an opening to get a quick strike with the other  liam so it has to go with another attack now i understand  so if i had /none/ understood  thank you thank you  i’ll take that mulligan for understanding  so now i’m going to stab him with mythcarver through the back  liam flanked matt yes  liam and flanked is at advantage yeah  matt no liam an ally nearby was it not  matt technically he’s not flanked because the other ally is prone  and is not currently threatening his face   liam all right that misses then marisha fucking fuck  liam so i’ve used an action but not the bonus action  so i’m going to disengage  matt /none/ okay  liam and i’m going to dart back as far away from him as i can get  ashley laura and taliesin  silly voices dd  liam 12 speed  the boots are off 6 got it yeah got it  matt all right there you go  that brings us to  at this point waiting around this way  as you guys are all distracted at this point  turns around takes a dagger  marisha who  laura there’s another guy marisha where did he come from  taliesin that’s the one that ran that /dung/ way he’s mine  marisha that yours the little shit  liam by the way the whitestone guards are shit  marisha yeah no shit laura this is all happening so fast  liam don’t they stand on the wall don’t they stand on places  sam it’s movie night  they’re all watching the sound of music in the rec room  travis vasselheim yeah they’re on the lax  liam whitestone whitestone travis i mean whitestone  matt this is all like 3 am at whitestone castle right now  that being the case the guard makes two /none/ dagger attacks  one at you percy and one at you pike  that’s natural 20 against you percy  taliesin natural 20 against me matt yes  taliesin goddamn it where’s my goddamn  ah shit  sam what do you need what what’s wrong  matt no it’s okay he rolled a 1  so you take 6 points of piercing damage  taliesin i was going to try and grab it  i’m just trying to find my  my dagger seems to have vanished  yeah i can’t find my dagger for some reason my gloves /none/  matt

you can see the shattering burned bits of rakshasa flesh  go flying across the entire exterior of the castle  /none/ as this column 20 30 40 feet up streaks up out of the top of the castle  lighting

the last game  liam yeah but look at it  can’t you see with your eyes its brown  matt well portions of it are brown now due to the blood that has seeped into it  from the various stab wounds that he’s suffered  liam i don’t really want to wear this  i’m a little confused right now i think i need to   sam /none/ what happened travis yeah how did that happen  ashley can i take a look at the robe  matt as you attempt to take the robe off  you feel like the strength is sapped from your body  and you’re like raspy groan  and the more you try to pull it off the more and more you start to feel  like it’s pulling the breath out of your lungs  ashley can i try to rip it off of him  liam ah wait wait wait wait wait  let’s figure out what’s going on  /none/ laura do i see anything can i land  matt yeah make a perception check   liam wait stop everyone stop breathes heavily  that thing came to me disguised as gilmore  he told me he wanted to talk we went for a walk he gave me this   full disclosure we all know he’s fucking sweet on me  we went for a stroll and then he turned into whatever he is  and then he fucking stabbed me in the gut  ashley wait but   matt you see guards scattered around the castle /none/  ashley gilmore gave you the robe  liam no he was disguised as gilmore marisha the rakshasa can disguise   liam he’s a skinchanger marisha he can shapeshift   marisha  and he can teleport and he can do all sorts of shifty things  liam which means we need to find gilmore and we need to find allura now  taliesin everyone get  marisha hang on hang on  marisha i go up to vax  and i cast dispel magic as i try and pull off the robe  matt okay  liam ahh /none/ ahh  it stings i think  matt go ahead and roll a d20  and add 6 for your wisdom  marisha add 6 to my wisdom  matt add 6 to the roll from your wisdom  marisha oh add 6 to the roll from my wisdom  oh adding my modifier right 14  matt 14 as you cast dispel magic and start pulling the robe back  you feel like someone’s pulling the skin off your body  sam oh god liam fuck me  matt you suffer 12 points of damage  as it feels /none/ like someone’s peeling the flesh off your body  sam and marisha wait does it come off  matt no  taliesin ive got a plan marisha it doesnt come off  travis i pull it off  taliesin no no no no no no  i’m grabbing vex  vax vex with me everyone start searching  tell them that we’re going to need a healer downstairs  and i’m going to take him we’re going to head towards   laura wait did you say me or him taliesin i’m taking both of you   taliesin  /none/ because i’m not  carrying him alone because he’s heavy  laura he’s actually quite light liam i’m lighter than my sister  taliesin i have a strength of 12 there’s not a lot i can do  laura ow no im serious dont  im really not strong  taliesin i’m going to try and drag him down towards the pit  with the orb of death  marisha oh that’s a good idea  travis are there any pieces of the rakshasa left  matt burned tiny chunks and ash  it was a full  it was /none/   we’re talking endofmatrixstyle agent smith scattering  liam scanlan sam what  liam will you grab that dagger off the ground for me  sam what dagger you had a   liam his dagger the dagger  no i’ve got your sword  and i toss it as we get dragged off  the dagger get the dagger for me  sam i’ll grab the dagger i’m coming with  liam i like them  marisha i go and i look for allura and gilmore  taliesin yes let them know what’s going on  marisha while /none/ they do that  matt okay so you take vax and vex down towards the ziggurat  laura come on liam groans  taliesin just make sure  if you start to feel strange as we go down there let us know  and we slowly inch towards the effects of it  liam this is why i didn’t even bother to take it off  laura you know what at least  it doesn’t smell as bad as your feathers  taliesin that’s so true  ashley i’d like to follow matt okay  liam life’s not that bad /none/ life’s not that bad  taliesin yes but your smell is  travis i’ll go too just as security sam i’m with  matt you’re with them sam yes  matt all right so you guys all make your way down  as you’re going through the castle it’s in utter chaos now  all the guards who in what was  about 20 to 30 seconds of action  since the moment of actual shouting at the top of the tower  the reaction time would be great  if it wasn’t such a short window they had to /town/ get up there  and you guys were right in the thick of it  and more trained than these soldiers  marisha as i’m looking for gilmore and allura  i’m alerting the guards of the visuals of the assailants  matt okay and the guards begin to continue pushing around  you can see now  lights are starting to come on in the town  you guys make your way down  into the subterranean tunnels under whitestone where the ziggurat is  you can see it once again the large pyramidlike structure  taliesin i cast /none/  no no never mind i’ll hold off keep walking  matt okay you make your way into the central chamber  it has a number of firebased braziers that are set in there now for light  that are just general fire  but a lot of them are burned down to embers  it’s very very low light in this area you can barely see anything in here  you guys make your way inside the room  it’s cold it’s dank it’s not a very comfortable atmosphere  taliesin okay very gently  liam i’ll do it /none/ i’ll do it  taliesin if this doesn’t work we can try something else  travis what are you doing laura i’ve got it  sam hold on we’re close enough that magic has no effect yeah  laura potentially liam potentially  sam i’ll cast mage hand to slap percy in the face  matt no effect sam no effect  sam okay we’re good liam all right  liam i’m going to just peel it slowly  i’m not going to rip it off like these assholes  matt okay it pulls back with no issue  laura /none/ hey get that shit off  sam throw it in the orb taliesin don’t throw it in the orb  laura somebody give him something to put on  grog do you have any more fancy robes  travis nope all out  taliesin put it on the ground we’ll deal with it  we’re not leaving it here  laura well just cover up your bits with it maybe  liam we look almost exactly the same   laura i don’t have any dangly bits i’m sorry to tell you  liam minus that one thing we are /none/ so close  taliesin three things three things marisha three things there’s a few  laura a couple other things liam yeah but still  travis i do have one other fancy robe  laura give him a fancy robe grog travis mmm  laura grog  travis yes  laura for my sake  travis all right last fancy robe to vax  sam will the bag of holding work down here  taliesin no liam shush you fucker  laura oh shit  matt you reach into the bag of holding and it’s just an empty satchel  /none/ taliesin yeah there’s no bag of holding in here  so why don’t we go upstairs now that it’s off  and we’ll leave it here and i’ll be the last to leave with it  laura wait why are you keeping it percy  taliesin because im not sure destroying it in here is the best idea  and im not sure if destroying it is going to damage him  taliesin so were going to be careful laura all right  travis arent there acid pools down here laura no  taliesin its not a terrible idea but /none/ we should   travis yeah there are  laura oh thats right thats where your gun went  liam but not near here not here  taliesin lets just very gently  we dont know what that is yet  so lets very gently get you out of the orbs influence  and then well remove it out of the orbs influence  and well see if theres a problem  liam i walk proudly and naked out of the fucking ziggurat  travis thats what i was going to ask  matt all right  taliesin i pick /none/ up the cloak  and move it outside the orbs influence to see if it has any effect  matt okay  as you pull it beyond the perimeter of what youve come to mark  and it is marked by the way  through the research of allura  and the folks that have been here for a while  there is a specific mark in the hallway where that barrier begins  taliesin i just gingerly start to put it forward watching him  matt no noticeable effect taliesin all right  laura nothing taliesin seems all right /none/  taliesin im going to slowly walk away from the   slowly bring it out of the influence of the sphere  matt no effect  laura does that mean we should take it back in and chop it up  so nobody ever puts it on  taliesin i think we should have someone look at it first  sam no we can use it as a weapon  taliesin or we could destroy it properly one or the other  travis probably a good idea should i check the bag of holding now  laura yeah look /none/ in it travis can i reach in for a fancy robe  matt yeah you pull out a fancy robe  travis awesome i wind it up like a towel and i smack vax on the ass super hard  liam whats  fucking hell and i dont even roll for it  screams  travis bare ass bare ass i get it really good like whack  liam grog grog travis yeah  liam brother i am so happy to be alive  travis yeah me too here you go whssht  liam whoo wait is this the one /town/ ugh  laura no no its a fancy robe its just a regular robe  liam are you sure laura and ashley yes  travis yeah put it on fucker matt laughs  matt the fear of robes has now set in marisha laughs in robes  taliesin i am carrying the robe on bad news  like a stank rag at this point through the hallway  matt okay while this is happening you make your way down  allura and gilmore werent staying in the castle  they were staying on the north side of the town  /town/ marisha as i walk towards them i want to throw up a skywrite once again  the de rolo crest just alerting people  matt okay and you do see there are lights coming on in the town  and guards are now going out through the streets  going through buildings  searching for individuals that match the description youre at  as you make your way towards gilmores home  you hear what sounds like a loud heavy thud  boof boof boof another one and suddenly a crash of glass  laura i take off run  /none/ oh shes by herself  matt shes there by herself  marisha okay  im going to cast polymorph on myself  matt okay  marisha and im going to go as a mouse  matt wild shape or polymorph  marisha polymorph  matt okay fft you turn into a tiny little mouse  marisha can i fit through the door  matt yep you fft skirt under the door  the first thing you notice now is there is a bookcase that is shattered  and there is a figure slumped in the corner where the table is /dung/ broken  theres a little bit of light from a lantern thats been knocked over  thats starting to catch fire on the curtains  and as the light whoosh from the flames begin to pick up  you can see the figure that was off to the side  suddenly lifts up in the air  and you now see there held aloft what looks to be a humanoid  wearing dark leathers a cloak and a hood groans  being held about four feet in the air tense up  walking out of the next room you see /none/ gilmore in disarray  a little bit of blood streaking down the forehead there  sweaty in the face with his arm out  sam ooh laura yeah  matt what did you say thats what i thought  and he closes his hand and you watch as the figure is just   squelching noise  all shocked and impressed exclamations  matt  squashed in this ball of flesh and you can see as it slowly twists  its like squeezing water out of a towel just blood pours out  all noises of disgust travis gleeful laughter /town/ yes  matt and then he releases his fingers and the figure thud  falls limp on the ground like a crushed doll  sighs  marisha i drop polymorph matt startled shout  marisha its okay its okay its me keyleth sorry  matt its not the night to be doing that to me  marisha shouting i know i know  all laugh  matt sighs i need a drink  marisha gilmore rakshasa in the town  pretending to be you trying to kill vax  matt right now  marisha yes also a bunch of fucking /none/ assassins  matt he grabs you by the arm  marisha scared yeah  matt  and just shfff  theres a rush of air and a sparkle of purplishblue energy  as you guys are walking through the tunnel  all of a sudden boof with a flash of light  you see standing before you in the tunnel  keyleth and a very harried gilmore who is   marisha breathless i found gilmore matt pants  laura i pull out my weapons  travis are we killing this one  marisha no this is real gilmore real /tavern/ gilmore  matt hi chuckles im glad to see youre all right  laura laughs taliesin cracks up  matt wasnt expecting it to be my birthday as well chuckles  liam oh im still here oh im still here  sam vax vax quick laura singing and naked  liam lets look at the backside instead this is a little awkward  sam vax ask him a question  that only gilmore would know the answer to  liam oh sh  what did i tell you in that tavern  the other night a couple of months ago /none/ i guess  what did i tell you  laura laughs do you remember liam yeah i do  matt and you can see now hes breathing heavy  hes been a little winded and his eyes are excited to see   excited to see you for multiple reasons but excited to see that youre alive  but as you ask him this question you see his demeanor darkens a little  that you had interests elsewhere  liam yeah thats gilmore  marisha as he says this  i do a little cantrip fog cloud around vaxs privies /tavern/  just a little floating fog cloud  liam oh not in my hair laura a little floating cloud of   marisha right around your waistline  ashley a little tutu marisha the old tutu  laura a little smoky tutu  marisha a little censor bar travis should i throw him the robe  taliesin anime bathhouses travis i thought i threw him the robe  laura he let it go he wanted to walk naked  liam its been a shit night who wants to get a drink  marisha well wait  matt i for one /none/ could really go for some heavy alcohol  marisha gilmore wheres allura wheres allura  matt i dont know  marisha gilmore if they were after us and they were after you  they were probably also after allura  we need to make sure that everyone on the council is okay  laura zahra kashaw  marisha all of them  matt then let us go search and then we shall drink  nevertheless  and gilmore steps into the fog cloud   all laugh  matt  and puts his arms around your neck  and pulls /none/ you in  deep into his shoulder  and as he holds you really close he whispers  im glad youre all right  liam quietly i dont say anything  matt he lets you go  liam i pick the dialogue choice in the telltale game where i say   laura you say dot dot dot ashley ellipses  marisha say nothing sam dot dot dot  matt he pulls back with a smile and kind of reads you  travis gilmore will remember that laura laughs  matt he gives a nod of understanding and takes a /none/ step back  im sorry  liam oh no no no  matt lets go make sure that everyone else is all right  come follow me  he turns around and goes into a jovial jog  you guys make your way up back up to the castle  kashaw and zahra are both fine  you come to them and find that their rooms were not disturbed  as neither of them were in the  actually no kashaw was  sam where was kashaw  laura he fought the rakshasa to begin with  matt laughs yeah /none/ no  you do come to the point where there are now a bunch of guards  swarmed around the outside of kashaws room  as you push past there is blood everywhere  everywhere  on the walls the ceiling the floor across the bed  travis awesome  matt and you see sitting on the edge of the bed  spear in hand shield tossed to the side also covered in bits of viscera  kashaw whos currently leaning against the edge  liam whats up stinkeye  matt they knew better right what else was going to /none/ happen  travis how many were there  matt oh just one  travis whoa all impressed laughter  travis cool cool respect laura were grabbing a drink kashaw  matt ill take a shower first but then a drink  marisha i grab him real fast and say  it was hotis the rakshasa remember from the slayers take  matt i always hated cats  ashley i put out my hand and say  ive heard a lot about you its nice to meet you  matt oh nice to meet you too  ashley i have a /none/ robe i have on a robe  travis “i have on a robe i have on a robe”  ashley im dressed im dressed  matt well say he closes the front a little bit  liam its probably way too large for you ashley a deep v  matt right right marisha yeah  matt its nice to meet you too  i dont normally dress like this either so dont worry  ashley im dressed like this all the time  matt huh  i like you  and he walks out  ill meet you guys in /none/ a minute  and he goes off to clean himself up  zahras fine theres been no attack on zahra  laura cassandra travis allura  marisha yeah lets split up i guess  taliesin lets all meet in the sitting room in ten minutes  so lets have anybody on the council meet there in ten minutes  ill send word to the guards to get everybody where they need to be  if anythings out of sort it will instantly reported to us  ashley good plan  liam im going to get my shit laura i want /town/ to put on my armor  taliesin im also getting my shit ashley yeah  laura and then go find zahra marisha im going to go look for allura  travis ill go for cassandra with you because i dont trust that bitch  liam laughs taliesin oh  matt all right you guys gather your stuff  at this time cassandras awake and shes actually in the process  of dealing with the guards that are coming back with information  theyve been sweeping parts of the town havent found anyone else  theres been no real followup  /none/ to any other figures that have been found  beyond the few select individuals  and its at this time  as you guys gather your stuff and begin to head back out  that allura comes into the front of the castle  she comes in hair tossed and she looks a little frazzled  is everyone all right  laura yes kima is she all right  matt she looks over her shoulder and you see kima come walking in  wearing what looks like a long nightshirt  her maul in her hand and dragging behind by /none/ the foot  what looks to be a mostlymashed face of one of the assassins  that tried to find its way into their home  matt dragging a long trail marisha still alive  matt no not alive at all  the head is caved in and theres a long trail of crimson  that leads all the way down the walkway  down the footpath of the castle  and disappears towards the base of the walkway  at the north side of whitestone  grunts  and throws him repeated thuds  tumbles onto the ground smears /none/ across a bit of the stonework  laura good work  matt you too  i can see the rest of you guys at least seem to be okay  travis yeah  taliesin who did get attacked out of curiosity  what happened to yours  marisha this assassin came through my window  taliesin did you kill him  marisha yeah well i actually i dont know  i chucked him out the window he might still be alive  taliesin im going to turn to a guard and say  search underneath the window of that bedroom /none/  anything you find   look carefully find a body if you dont find a body find a trail  good work windows are good  sam do rakashakashas typically hire people  where do they come from do they come with a band of merry men  i dont know anything about them  laura theyre just tigers do tigers   matt allura goes like what did you say  sam oh there was a rakashasha  taliesin a rakshasa marisha a rakshasa  sam no i think youre saying it wrong  laura a hotis a /none/ hotis  marisha his name was hotis  rakshasas are devils from the nine hells  matt im quite familiar with them yes  sam do they travel with assassin friends all the time  where do they come from  matt well they come from the hells  but they make allies all throughout the realm  theyre manipulators they masquerade as anyone  that they think would help their current intent and goal  they lie they deceive they convert  liam keyleth and i encountered him last  marisha and kashaw wherever he is  liam and /none/ kash and i took his last blood  and i heard a threat but i didnt make anything of it  marisha we watched him die  liam and here he is again so i suspect this will happen again  matt so you slew this rakshasa tonight  travis well this one did  matt well that will be vengeance on two then it will be back  sam is there a way to prevent the shakakan  from coming back  liam is there a way to finish it off for good  marisha permanently  matt there /none/ are a couple of ways all of them involve  going to its home plane and destroying it there  so unless you marvel a trip to the nine hells  its going to be a bit of paranoia for a while  it does take weeks months for them to regain their form  but the process is very painful for them  and as far as what ive read  at least  they only really care about getting back at the ones that took it from them  laura so still him and you sam and now /none/ pike  marisha is it one of those things where it passes off down the line  or is this rakshasa going to be pissed at both of them  matt since youre alive its vengeance was not sated  i think thats two of you on its shit list  liam allura would you be able to  give us guidance on how to get to it  i mean this is a group decision  and im not going to be fooled in the same way again  im going to be sleeping with my fucking knives for /none/ a while  but this will just repeat how do we get to it  matt well for right now  its screaming its way back to the pit of its own creation  it will take weeks months before it reforms  it will be very vulnerable during that time  mind you its not the most welcoming place either  but sighs if we make a journey there in a few weeks time  we could probably find where its currently recouping  and slay it for good  laura how long will that take  matt how /none/ long will what take the journey  instantaneous to find it longer  to survive that journey that is no easy task  as it is a place of great danger and great evil  liam are you able to locate it once its reformed  matt its possible  it depends on what sort of magic wards it may have  i dont know where it is we could certainly try  marisha i believe its immune to certain magics correct  matt that is the issue  ashley do they get any stronger when they come back  /none/ or are they always the same  matt all creatures dont like to make the same mistake twice  thence the why it seems it brought friends  marisha speaking of those friends  you said these rakshasas are master manipulators  is there a group or an organization here that has it out for us  marisha i mean im sure many but  matt i am certain there are many  matt as there are a few that have it out for me im certain  liam were there any survivors from our assailants  taliesin were looking /none/ but none of ours  liam sighs well if there are any we follow it back to the source  taliesin yes  marisha in the meantime i guess its time to drink  liam quietly also ale travis quietly also ale  matt it will be hard to find this rakshasa  now or any time in the very near future  as its still finding its seed of corporeal form  sighs but i agree this has to be rectified  marisha i still feel like we need to reach out to vanessa  let her know whats /none/ going on  liam maybe up the   marisha cost of the contract liam  asking price on that  laura scoffs yeah good luck liam laughs  matt im a bit confused but do what you need to do regardless  and she looks to gilmore who has taken a breath now  and has pulled an evening flask out of his night robe  he takes a swig off of it goes  i think we need to quicken  our reinforcements of the city  i think we need to make certain that not only are /none/ we scryproof  but i believe we need to find a way to alert ourselves  of any sort of celestial or fiend intrusion  lauar so its a fiend liam a fiend also   matt the very definition  liam this is not just a vendetta  it knows about whitestone it knows about our base of operations  laura how do you know that  taliesin because it came here  liam it looked us in the face it knows were here  it knows where we are it knows all of us  it knows him /none/ it knows all of us  taliesin it may not know its value but it does   matt the rakshasa  at this point gilmore is like  thats actually a very valid point  how would it  did it meet us how would it know what i look like  marisha good point did it meet us  liam when was the last time you saw us before kiki found you  matt you mean last night  liam the last conversation we had laura okay dinner  matt dinner would have been the last time yes /none/  laura okay  matt at this point allura thinks for a second she goes  im fairly certain  that they can peer into the minds of those nearby  and can read surface thoughts  it may know more secrets than you think it does  which makes it that much more important  that we eliminate it  liam yeah good that guy is a liability  sam well put it on the list  laura i know right next to the dragons  marisha he could be following us for a while  liam he could /none/ rat us out to the dragons laura sighs  liam hes fucking pissed off  he wants to hurt me and now her as badly as possible  all of you matter to us  i think the rakshasa comes before the dragons  maybe not before the vestiges but on the list  taliesin if we can put some manpower  towards discovering where he is and where he lies  while we continue our search for the vestiges  and then once we have a solid lead we can follow it through  matt i can work on /none/ that  ashley can i go over to the dead body  that kima threw into the middle of the room  and cast speak with dead  sam ooh liam whispering yeah girl  taliesin thats a way to go travis is his face super crushed  travis is it like krsch halloween mask insideout  matt yeah its just smashed inward  travis well hold on let me reach into his mouth  and i reach up under his nasal cavity  and i pop his face back out just a little bit  sam ugh liam zombie /none/ groans  travis its like a deflated soccer ball right  matt yeah its horrifying straightup horrifying  ashley five questions sam five questions  liam i thought it was three five thats good  matt okay all right  so you have five questions you can ask the creature  as it sits there and you guys watch  as pike comes over in her robe and sits down next to it  you touch your symbol and reach out and touch the body  and all of a sudden you watch as the chest rises again  rasping /none/ inhale  you hear this horrible sucking sound as air is brought into the chest cavity  he doesnt breathe out he just holds the air in  and the deformed wrecked bone shardpierced face  that once was this assassin which you can see now  it looks to be loosely elvish in appearance  or at least theres some essence of elvish to its form  but the eyes are gone the eyes are just mush  it slowly sits up and turns towards you pike going  rasping groans  ashley who sent you  matt slowly /none/ hotis  ashley hotis  matt hired us  ashley what was   laura liam and travis overlapping hotis hired us  ashley hotis hired us  what is your organization  matt we run the clasp in stillben  sam stillben  travis the clasp in stillben laura sheesh  ashley three more questions  travis how did the rakshasa know to find us here  how did hotis know  ashley how did hotis know to find us here  matt i dont know  he had information  he led us here instructed our strikes  /none/ sam how many men taliesin how many of them were there  ashley how many of you were there  matt we were 6 in total  liam youve got one more question  taliesin where were they all supposed to meet  when everything was finished  travis or who would know  more than him  liam who would know more laura who is his boss or something  ashley who his boss was travis or who does he report to  laura within the clasp who does he report to in the clasp  liam who gives /none/ you your orders  ashley who gives you your orders  laura whispering within the clasp ashley within the clasp  matt chuckling thats a fine   laura i have one job on this ship  ashley i have one job  laura and travis its stupid   ashley and travis shouting  but im going to do it  all laugh  travis so good ashley yes  matt spireling veekar groans  marisha veekar  matt and with that the last bit of air  that had been trapped in the chest cavity  has been /dung/ utilized and the body rasping groan  goes back to its still rest no longer moving  no longer puppeteered by your divine energies  travis ill take care of this  marisha veekar laura spireling veekar  taliesin so i think we have 4 dead bodies were missing 2 then  laura wait 4 dead bodies wait   sam wait theres kashaws taliesin kashaws oh  laura plus kimas  taliesin mine yours   laura and taliesin gilmores  matt and gilmores like  weak chuckle i actually have one thats pretty rough  in my place /none/ right now  liam he got akirad  matt i got a little angry  laura did you kill one or two  matt oh just one  marisha so the only one thats missing in action  is the one that i shoved out the window  taliesin and were waiting for news on whether that one   matt is there one that was left alive  marisha well there was one that was shoved out a window  so hopefully he died  matt well find out travis hm sloppy  liam broke his legs and his /none/ heart never woke  marisha i heard that grog  travis oh ahem i said super  laura laughs good save  matt all right drinks please  travis yeah  sam at some point percy ask gilmore about that robe  taliesin oh yeah  i still actually have it it occurs to me  i havent put it down yet  matt laughs hes holding it like a pair of soiled underpants all   taliesin ive actually been using bad news like a   marisha like a surrender flag  taliesin like spindle like a bindle /none/  marisha there you go taliesin hobo  marisha hobo bindle  taliesin this was given to vax  it was mystical it was attached to your skin  liam peeling the skin off my flesh  matt shudders  he takes it for a second he puts his hand over  and his eyes flicker for a second with a spark of arcane energy  and he sits back  no this is indeed a cursed robe  its a robe of flaying  laura a robe of flaying travis flaying  sam and laura gross ashley yikes  /none/ travis awesome  sam is it worth anything  matt chuckles to the right people maybe  liam the clasp yeah sam well why dont you take it  matt oh i dont want to have any hand in this type of business  im sorry i deal with abovetheboard magical items  youve gone creative with me but even that was relatively harmless  this slowly takes the skin off of its wearer  i dont wish to have this part of my repertoire  ashley if we destroy it though would that hurt vax  matt well if /none/ youve removed it from him  then the enchantments been broken  sam so does it  do you have to  anyone you put it on it curses them  liam it sticks its like fucking flypaper  sam keep that robe laughs travis yeah  travis ill keep it  laura in the bag of holding travis yeah  liam yeah its not a bad idea  laura dont play with it grog travis why  laura just dont put it on because you think it will be fun  liam you look way better mostly naked so /none/ dont   travis im not putting my bits where vaxs were  ill just keep it in the bag  liam ow that hurts my feelings  laura percy  taliesin yes  laura are your guards very welltrained in tracking  taliesin i honestly dont know i havent been here  but we hunt we are  everybody here hunts  laura trinket has their scent i mean i can send him to help  taliesin thats a great idea thats a brilliant idea yes please  we also i might add in theory have a wolf patrolling /none/ the area  travis yes baldricks somewhere  taliesin and im sure hes aware that theres a commotion  liam i walk over to gilmore for a second  liam shaun you know  sorry matt ah yes  liam wait wait wait hey hand that over big guy  matt but of course liam yeah thank you  matt youve certainly earned it  liam you know everything  about everything  matt stuttering i wouldnt say i know everything about everything  liam its close matt between the two of us  matt and he motions toward allura /none/  pretty sure we know everything but she more than i  liam i can agree with that we found this in a tomb  laura what are you pointing at  sam his pec  marisha your heart laura your boob  liam my fucking rockhard pec the armor i tap the armor  as you fucking very well knew  laura bailey  i kind of understand it can you tell anything about it  laura other than the fact that it smells really bad  liam shush yeah it does smell bad  scanlan gave me some /dung/ patchouli to rub on it  but it only does half the job  what can you tell me about it it belonged to a god  matt he takes a minute and walks around you  looking at the armor up and down  looking at you up and down a little bit but mostly at the armor  his eyes flare a few times with arcane sparks  this is a powerful vestige my friend  this has existed for quite some time and youve   well theres certainly a bit of dark divine energy around it /none/  it looks like it has the capability  to resist most elements when given the instruction  and it safeguards the life of the bearer  and it looks like theres some sort of a   tell you what follow me  liam yeah  matt and he stops and he goes  its really me this time follow me  liam i know it is  matt all right  and he walks outside of the front of the castle to the walkway  stepping over the crimson smear that once was the one assassin  and /none/ he walks up to the edge  of the sheer cliffs that are on each side of that walkway  and the elevated cleaved mountain the castle was built on  he walks up to the very edge with you and goes  do you trust me  liam quietly i do  matt as soon as you look down  you feel a thrust as he pushes you off the cliff  at that moment you suddenly instinctively look up  and from outside the back of the armor fwwsh   travis what marisha oh  matt  /none/ these giant black raven wings spill out from the sides  laura wait so you could have flown when you came out of the dragon  liam only if i know how to work it laura gasps  matt you get the

smiling  nervous laughter  liam sorry  matt thank you no its all right i would have been fine  liam you are a dear dear friend you are a /none/ dear friend  and i give him a big diagonal hug a long strong hug  matt he freezes for a moment  still figuring out his boundaries with the dynamic being what it is  but eventually he gives in and you feel his arms take you in as well  and you guys have this long honest connecting hug  and as this happens the wings also wrap around  and envelop the both of you  travis good moment laura frustrated its so ridiculous  travis hes alive let it go  matt and then time seems /none/ to pass for a minute  and as you release him the wings fluttering sound  scatter into black feathers in the wind and disappear  sam whispering wow laura frustrated noise  matt he steps away from you and you can see  theres just a little streak down the side of his face  and he reaches up and smacks you on the cheek a little bit  glad youre all right  liam i am a great

in her head  and brings her hand up  eras to no est  and begins drawing this strange glyph in the air  that where her finger traces you can see a slight sparkle falls behind  before it forges some sort of a letter that you dont recognize  and it passes through you foomf  and as it gets through you cant help but to get pushed back for a second  do you feel any different  liam fart noise  matt no

 ashley 23  matt 23 you push kima aside and take a very intense look at his body  ashley move /none/ aside move aside move aside  matt oh  very intense look over  physically there does not appear to be any ailment to him whatsoever  there are traces of exhaustion in him  and you do have a point of exhaustion by the way for a lack of evenings rest  but theres no signs of onset of splotchiness or diseases  theres no pulsing or darkened vein marks  nothing physical  ashley no poison  marisha what did you try on him pike  ashley medicine check  laura are you cursed is he cursed  /none/ marisha i

have siblings ive /dung/ seen this before  liam laughs  matt and so as percy has wandered off at this time  you guys both hold hands and channel through both of your abilities  the greater restoration spell  suddenly you feel like this dark hook  that was in the center of your being is lifted  and as it dissipates youre still exhausted  and still lost an entire evenings worth of rest  but whatever was keeping you in that nightmarish realm of stasis  seems to have been dispelled  liam hows my intestines  matt better tired /none/  your midsection is very sore from the constant flexing  marisha did pike and i notice anything  when we ripped out this darkness from his chest  matt you gather that there was some curse  that had taken hold of his body  laura ah he was cursed ashley yeah he was

laura and you said 300 gold  travis 320 matt 300 gold  matt and you find what looks to be a fistsized glass sphere  laura a whatsized glass sphere marisha glass sphere  matt fistsized glass sphere  about that big  taliesin it might be a gazing sphere be careful keep it under cover  keep it wrapped in something  liam i want to walk /none/ out towards our beast here  and hold out my hand  matt he walks up to you sniffs smells your hand and steps into it  he headbutts the palm of your hand and then runs his head under it  ashley oh percy can i touch him  matt theres a familiar scent  you can

looking at  travis baldrick thank you you are free to do with this as you will  matt grunt chomp  he picks it up in his jaws again and starts walking outside  spits it on the outside of the grounds rolling off the edge  it doesnt go completely off  but one of the legs is dangling off the side  and /none/ the guards wait there then take it and pull it away  the wolfs not going to eat the dead body  but its done hes done his job  he takes it out of the castle gets it out of your way  and then begins to step back down the walkway path south of the castle  making his way back towards whitestone and the surrounding forest  taliesin good boy good boy  laura i shake it  matt you shake it you actually look inside  theres a cloudy liquid  at the center of it /none/  when it was at rest it had no real motion  but as you shake it it swirls on the inside  laura oh shit i made something happen  liam bloop outlook shady  matt laughs  marisha you found a magic 8ball  travis signs point to yes liam laughs  taliesin well stop by gilmores on our way back up to the front hall  laura allura do you know what this is  matt she takes a look at it  theres a little sparkle of arcane energy in her eyes again  youre starting /none/ to get the theme here  there is a specific spell that shes using to identify these objects  youve seen it done before  she takes a look at it and goes  well i can see why this would be very useful  for a member of the clasp  its a scrying eye  matt and she throws it back to you laura gasps  marisha its a scry  what  liam and sam a scrying eye laura a scrying eye  marisha oh yeah sure  matt when you take essentially 10 minutes to focus /none/ on the eye  you can scry as per the spell  but it can only be used for 10 minutes and it cannot be used until the

could marisha it works like scrying  laura you can scry oh you can scry for anything  matt as per the spell once per day  liam what she /none/ does to waste a spell you can do as a freebie  and youre so nosy so its perfect for you  laura it actually is really perfect  taliesin thats disquieting excellent  laura i really really like this thing  matt you can see allura her face gets a little stern at this  this is precisely the issue we have here  if they could scry information anyone can  which is why im going to get with gilmore  and go and get together with the rest of the arcane minds here in whitestone  and /none/ were going to try to ward this place from any sort of intrusion  if possible id like to blanket this entire area with illusion  id like it so those who should not know that whitestone even exists do not  liam is there anything we can do to help  matt honestly do what youre doing  although i may need some aid from you there  and she looks towards you pike and says  if were going to find out where this rakshasa is  and how to head it off at the pass in the /none/ coming weeks  i think your divine nature would be of great aid  you and keeper yennan between the two of you  i think we could map out a plot to head it off at the pass  and when you return and are ready head into the hells ourselves  and take it down  while theres still time  ashley i would be glad to help matt all right  ashley its okay i can come back to you guys at any time  liam what do you mean  marisha but youre so important pike /none/  ashley well i dont know marisha we tend to need you a

feywild  travis feywild  taliesin weve seen what the vestiges can be  i think theyre terribly important  and we can return from the feywild immediately  and in theory be right /none/ back here when

your life and your destiny  and you seem to know where youre going  boxes fall offscreen  marisha fucking shouts assassin  matt you look around and you see  a boy holding a /none/ wheelbarrow nearby

or know where im going  marisha laughs i guess thats /none/ probably all of us  ashley yeah  marisha i guess i just  im a little curious  on how your relationship with sarenrae works  because it doesnt necessarily seem like she is in control of you  ashley no  marisha or has dominion over you  ashley its an interesting thing i think  she just helps when we need her or when i need her  and i think for the rest of the time she just   marisha does her own thing  ashley  does her own thing marisha yeah  ashley /none/ it was interesting  going to the temple of the raven queen  she seems very interesting to me  marisha how do you mean  ashley i dont know  marisha like more ashley shes just very involved  marisha involved yeah  ashley but maybe thats   maybe thats because vax has fully given himself to her  marisha would you say  you havent fully given yourself to sarenrae  ashley hesitantly i think i try to  but theres always that little part of me that thinks  or has doubt  so i dont /none/ know  marisha growing up in the ashari tribe we were taught  that the gods mind their own business and we mind our own  i dont have any disrespect for them  but also want to tread lightly  ashley yeah i think thats a very good way to handle it  marisha okay i dont know  i guess i dont know what i really wanted to find  i guess misery loves company  ashley yeah  marisha it feels better

starting to be put back up again  the city is definitely over time coming back to life  you also know that /town/ throughout the day  you can see allura and gilmore and the farseer eskil  are

gimbal  and making sure that everything itself can sustain the necessary weight  without putting too much pressure on a single point within the broom  to actually splinter the wood or damage the actual object  youre not even paying attention  to the fact that /none/ theres very little airflow  and the sweats been dripping off of your face  as you just need to get this project done  and in the moment it finally hits you not knowing what time it is  but you lift it up in your hands and you can see the completed work  hoping it will function we shall see  but for now your project is done

what looks to be a few small pools of water  that have gathered in this small glade that surrounds you  and thats where well pick up next week  ashley oh laura it sounds beautiful  matt or two weeks
