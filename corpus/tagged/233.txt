ahead and get into  tonights episode of critical role  dramatic music  matt welcome back before we begin real fast i have been notified that twitch is having some  audio sync issues recommendation has been said to try and switch between the flash player or the  html5 player on twitch that seems to be fixing the /none/ issues for a lot of people out there so if  youre having issues with that reloading or trying that switchover should fix the audio sync  issues if youre having any  without further ado last we picked up vox machina who had been traveling to collect the  vestiges of divergence artifacts from an old ancient time to gain enough power to combat the  chroma conclave a group of chromatic dragons that assailed burps pardon taldorei led by  thordak the cinder king when you get nervous you get the burps i feel like robert durst  /none/ travis robert kraft the owner of the patriots  matt different guy you in searching these artifacts found that one in the city of ankharel had been  taken out from under your nose by a longforgotten npc named ripley  marisha well she wasnt forgotten  matt you know what i mean you gave chase down to the glintshore island of the hespet archipelago  and upon storming the beaches destroying her ship you walked into the jungle where an ambush  turned into folly you charged into what appeared to be a couple of illusions as the floor /none/  detonated beneath you setting you across the ground and starting an encounter with snipers in  position at halfhealth and below for most of you  you gave a very good fight and still managed to push through unfortunately dr ripley with the  reveal that she has now bound herself to orthax the shadow demon that once plagued percys  inspiration and nightmares bent on vengeance managed to take him slay him and leave him cold  on the ground  as a group you did manage to dissect dr ripley very aggressively and get vengeance back for /none/ your  friend but where we left off youd just let the adrenaline and the shock of the moment hit you as  ripleys breath expends and a tiny tree begins to try and break and grow from her corpse on this  parched land  so what do you want to do  sam chuckles we have no idea  laura oh no  sam yeah  travis wait did she originally take percys gun was that what she was using  sam i dont think so she took his designs  marisha he threw percys gun into the /none/ pool of acid  travis should we collect her gun now  sam were all extremely emotional but we need to move quickly if were going to do anything we  need to collect all the guns  marisha we should collect her guns we need her other hand and we need the vestiges off of her  fucking body  travis well lets collect those quickly  marisha grog  travis yes  marisha will you do the honors of taking her other hand  travis i would love to use my teeth for that no ill use the /none/ axe  matt all right with a heavy thud sound her hand is jettisoned from the wrist her left hand as it  scatters across the broken glass floor of the center of the jungle here in glintshore  travis this one right  sam theres only one so yes thats the one  travis bag of colding  matt fair enough kynan is still standing there the adrenaline wearing off of him and hes at a  good 15 20foot distance from all of you just standing  travis i forgot are we killing him  liam hold on /none/ a second i walk over do you have the blade  matt stammers he looks down and he seems to have dropped it after everything that transpired  and he picks it up and holds it  liam ive come a long way for that  matt take it he throws it to your feet and it spins and scatters and comes to a halt at the tip  of your boot  liam wait here a moment please i bend down i take the knife and i walk it over to keyleth and  put it in her hands /none/ and i walk back to him how  matt i didnt mean for any of this to happen  liam how there are people behind me who want you dead and i cannot blame them how  matt i wouldnt blame them either look after we met i was hurt i was angry i knew i could be  someone despite what you told me and i could prove it prove that i was worth your attention  and i left emon and my home to seek that destiny and im sure many of you did the same  liam /none/ do you know what shape emon is in right now and this is what you choose to do with your time  matt you dont know what ive been through  liam what has that man done to you what has she done to you what have any of them except for  me done to you and what have i done except be an asshole  matt look when she picked me up in kymal she taught me a lot i learned a lot she also told me  that you werent who i thought you were when everything /none/ went down in emon with the dragons  she said you did that  liam summoned the dragons  matt you were responsible for it she had me listen in to a conversation where you admitted  that it was your fault  liam id like to make an insight check  matt go for it  liam sighs no  matt he seems emotionally on the brim of a complete nervous breakdown but hes holding his  ground his hands are shaking in place as he stands staring at you with the look of a man on  the /none/ precipice  liam kynan what am i to do with you  laura well deal with him later  liam i ought to cut the heart from your ribs i ought to cut out my own is there anyone else  here now is that it  matt well we went back to the cavern to set up but you got here too quickly  liam how long have you been here  matt only a few hours  liam a few hours was all it took for that are there more of you  matt we have a few /none/ people on the ship  travis not anymore  liam listen to me i dont know whats going to happen in the next 24 hours for you but the best  thing you can do right now is help us when anyone asks you to do something you do it  matt well i would ask for a chance to redeem myself but i am also beginning to understand what  ive done and i accept whatever judgment  you see fit just know that just know that  ive been very confused  liam look at me kynan look /none/ at me you help right now put all that out of your mind right  now you help can you do that  matt whispering how can i help  liam just do whatever we ask  matt whatever you want me to tell you i know a little bit anything just let me know  liam were going to table this just be johnnyonthespot right now all right  matt okay  laura tearfully grog can you pick him up percy  travis yeah where am i taking him  marisha i have nothing left i have no way /none/ to get us out of here quickly right now  travis can i ask is orthax still here thats who that was right  liam yes  marisha orthax could have his soul for all we know  laura do we sense him is orthax around can you sense evil  liam yeah i could yes  matt okay so you sense as part of your paladin ability divine sense i believe it was  liam yeah 60 feet demons celestials devils  matt yeah as you guys are going through ripleys things you do sense there is a pulse /none/ of fiendish  energy emanating from somewhere near ripleys body  marisha near ripleys body  laura how do we destroy him  sam i dont think we can hes just a shadow isnt he  liam we have to go to him  travis oh i was going to ask the question of could he help us with percy  sam orthax  travis yeah  marisha honestly right now i think it sounds crazy that im saying this but we have mutual  interests with him it might not be the worst idea  matt whos inspecting ripleys /none/ body  laura i will i guess  matt a few things you find as you rummage through you find about 1051 gold pieces  two weeks of rations some of which appear to  have been dampened and will probably be gone soon  you do find the cloak the dagger that kynan used still lays to the ground no it was handed to  you so you have it right now there is what appears to be a small polished grey stone with a  couple of runic symbols carved into it you also find what appears to /none/ be a small leather case a  long thin case about that long that is latched shut and her gun which is similar to percys  pepperbox but thinner longer more refined its a deep gunmetal gray color with brass sections and  what appear to be portions of whitestone built into it as she pulls the gun out you immediately  know that thats the direct source of the fiendish energy  liam put that down please put it on the ground  sam its in the gun  liam its in the gun  marisha just like last /none/ time  laura so we drop it in acid again  sam well that didnt kill it did it just got it out of the gun  marisha and what if he has percy  laura no  travis well lets try and get him back first before we get upset about it  laura how do we get him to whitestone  travis yeah how do we move  sam we have an airship  travis thatll be too slow  sam maybe it can take us somewhere with trees  laura somewhere with a tree  marisha i /none/ need to rest  travis how long  marisha i need to sleep  liam this tree is stunted thats coming out of ripleys body  matt yeah its a slowgrowing tree its only about six feet tall it wouldnt be large enough  to use her spell through it this is the remnants of a fenthras death there are a few  large jungle trees like i mentioned before that have managed to find root and grow in this jungle  itd be like one healthy tree for every 50 that are burnt charred and petrified  there are /none/ trees available in this jungle that  in theory could be used for that spell  if you had it available to you  travis i dont remember do we have a way to call pike  laura we have the stone  sam wait does that send one of us back to her  laura potentially  sam one living soul holding a dead soul  travis or can we bring her to us  marisha i could try and scry her let me see actually  laura i could try putting percy in the necklace and  sam /none/ going through yes  marisha but what if you cant get him back out living and willing right  laura yes  marisha we dont want him to get stuck  travis is that correct  sam no disrespect hes an object right now so if one of used the stone holding him itd be  carrying him like a sword hed go through  matt make an intelligence check with plus two because of your jack of all trades add your  intelligence modifier plus two  sam okay 16 18  matt 18 that might not work for /none/ most spells  laughter  sam shame intelligence check  matt hes still considered a creature its just a dead creature  laura so we rest and then we go to whitestone in the morning  liam can you do the mansion scanlan are you tapped out  sam i could but  marisha i cant believe that theres nothing we can do right now  liam we could stay here  laura i still bring trinket out of the necklace and i cast cure wounds on him  matt okay yeah as trinket emerges from the necklace his unconscious /none/ form hits the ground  laying on the side as you walk up and place your hand still breathing and your warm touch presses  across his fur and the breathing inflates into one deep breath and then bear noises the head leans  up and begins licking your hand as you finish the casting of the spell go ahead and roll hit points  for trinket  liam im also going to give him a butt scratch and do lay on hands and give him  another five hit points  laura nine whole points plus five  matt /none/ you also do notice vex on the gun it has across the handle the bottom of the handle the  name of the weapon which is named animus  laura animus  matt and across the barrels you now see there are three empty barrels and three that still have  names  laura can i read the names  matt the names are rictor wells oz grud and king bertrand dwendal  sam oh my god  matt rictor wells oz grud and king bertrand dwendal apparently all people that ripley in some  way shape or form felt /none/ vengeful towards  liam im going to walk over and pick up the false arm that i hacked off will you put this in the  bag  travis which one oh regular bag  liam this big old arm here  travis can i see the little stone with the runes on it  sam why dont we ask kynan what it is maybe hes seen her use it  travis kynan what is this  matt thats what she used to listen in on you guys  marisha ugh hang on wait let me see it does it /none/ look like the other scrying stone that we have  matt no its a very different enchantment this one looks a little simpler and upon looking at it  theres no magic left in it you did disenchant the other side of the enchantment of her old  gun  travis what about the little latch box thats closed  sam yeah open that little box  travis i open the latch box or she opens the latch box  sam i open the latch box  laura just rip everything out of my hands go for it  sam /none/ we all simultaneously tear it open  matt okay as you open the cap on the edge of this leather casing you pull it open you see  its essentially a side scroll case on the inside there is a single tightly wound piece of  parchment the smell immediately is very musty and old with a hint of burnt wood and yeah theres  some sort of parchment that is tightly coiled in there  sam should i take it out and take a look  travis read that  laura have you seen her messing with that kynan /dung/  matt that was something we found in the cave when we got here but she quickly grabbed it and  put it away and wouldnt tell us what it was  liam what is this cave  matt i only got to the outside of it i was standing guard  travis so you havent been inside  matt no  liam how far off  matt maybe a couple of miles its at the base of the mountain  travis what if that was her escape route what if theres a way out  sam yeah could be /none/ ill open it and look it over  matt okay make an arcana check  marisha be careful scanlan  sam not good do i add jack of all trades is that a thing now 16  matt well you add it to all ability checks and skills youre not proficient in  sam i am proficient in this 14  matt 14 thats fine thats enough yes it is a scroll of gate  sam a gate scroll  travis good thing  marisha oh we just got our ticket out of here  sam the scroll allows an /none/ arcane caster to use an action to cast the 9thlevel spell gate  laura do we have an arcane caster is that you scanlan  sam am i an arcane caster  matt yeah you are an arcane caster consider this is an extremely powerful spell that has a lot  of various uses so consider just so you know what its capable of im going to read you  some of the spell here  sam also i might not be able to do it because it says level nine if the spell is higher than the  level /none/ the caster can use then they must make a spellcasting ability check to succeed  travis okay so just cut off your foot as a tithe  matt so gate just so you know you conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see  within range to a precise location on a different or the same plane of existence the portal is a  circular opening which you can make five to 20 feet in diameter it lasts for up to a minute the  portal has a front and back on each plane where it appears it /none/ would be between planes essentially i  would say if you wanted to use it as just a teleportation circle you could but its a waste  of a 9thlevel spell  sam but its a waste of a 9thlevel spell  matt comparatively to what she can do with tree stride and other things like that  marisha we might want to save it  liam is it different from plane shift  matt deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this from opening in their  presence when you cast the spell you can speak /none/ the name of a specific creature a pseudonym  title or nickname doesnt work specific name of a creature if the creature is on a plane other  than the one youre on the portal opens and pulls them through to you  so it has a lot of various uses  laura we could bring the rakshasa through  marisha we could if we knew its name  travis we stow it  matt you can bring a lot of things through on that instantly for better or for worse  liam hotis orthax  marisha that is how /none/ its different from plane shift  sam or we could use this to go save our friend  laura what do we know about these healing spells  travis what healing spells  laura well what we need to do to percy how long do we have to get him to someone  marisha i have a feeling the longer we wait the harder it will be  travis then we rest now yeah hard choices but we have to help ourselves if we plan to help him  marisha but like you said the gate spell could theoretically bring /none/ orthax back if we might need  to who knows  sam or it could bring a healer to us right now  travis i say save it and rest thats my vote  marisha how long has percy been dead  matt at this point maybe 20 25 minutes  travis voice your opinions now do it  sam i dont know how death magic works  laura i dont either  sam i dont know if eight hours makes this huge difference  marisha it depends on what youre trying to do i have one ability i could /none/ use you have to do it  within ten days but im not necessarily comfortable doing it regardless i dont know  ive never done it before and i dont know the ramifications id prefer to get him to pike  travis then lets summon the mansion and do this  sam all right but we have to collect things first we need all the guns even the broken ones  if any one finds any of these they could be retrofitted or used for evil in the future and  thats something that percy would not want ever  /none/ travis ill go get them because im still doing pretty dandy and ill absorb all the glass shards  from walking around  sam i need to go find our dog he probably wont be able to be found but he could be somewhere  and i feel like we should look in this cavern dont you think  liam we could go  marisha ill stay with percy  sam someone has to stay with him  travis okay if you two want to go check the cavern ill collect all the guns and check the  bodies of /none/ the people that are down  laura can we have taken a short rest to heal a bit before we do anything  matt you could do that just half an hour to an hour you can do that so you guys take a short  rest now to use any of your hit dice to go ahead and heal up and scanlans giving song of rest so  you get an additional  sam 1d12  matt 1d12 to each one of you guys on top of whatever youre healing  marisha keyleth takes percys body and i drag /none/ him over to the table and i lay him out and i start  cleaning him and cleaning his wounds as best as i can  matt hes a bloody mess but at the same time there is a strange look of peace on his face it  both comforts and upsets you and you have a hard time concentrating on the face youre just  focusing on the body as you clean him and make him look as good as you possibly can using druidcraft  and other spells at your disposal  travis guns and bodies  matt /none/ make an investigation check  travis nice oh minus two 15  matt 15 all right you find lets see you find 620 gold pieces total across all the bodies  you find two pistols two rifles there is also a longbarreled bad newslike rifle that was  discarded across the battlefield by ripley earlier in the fight its busted there is a greatsword  and a set of full plate that were on the goliath that you battled  travis full plate  matt full plate yes you find a total of 185 rounds of small ammunition  travis /none/ okay for the pistols  matt and about 26 rounds of large ammunition for the rifles  travis got it 26 rounds  matt you find a potion of superior healing on the smashed corpse of the wizard that didnt get a  chance to use it before it fell to its horrible death thats a really good one a set of bracers  of defense plus two which i think youve encountered previously  travis i have  matt so you can write that down and yeah thats all you find on the corpses  travis those bracers of /dung/ defense need to be attuned  matt its a plus two they do need to be attuned im pretty sure let me double check im pretty  sure they do yeah and you have the cloak and you have the dagger at your disposal and the gun  if you wanted to take the time to inspect them during the short rest  travis okay  matt okay so while hes doing that you guys go off to the cave  liam yes and im going to look for traps the entire way there  laura and im going to /none/ ride my broom there so i dont get any damage walking on the glass  matt okay is kynan staying behind with you guys  sam i can keep him and he can help me look for the dog  matt okay go ahead and make an investigation check  sam does he make one too  matt he does yeah  sam 30  matt it takes you the better part of 30 minutes or so but the needle in the haystack was not as  hard a search as you thought and you find it wedged between two /none/ branches back in its hard onyx  form unscathed seemingly from the explosion  sam just scratch him behind his ear sorry maybe well do more next time  matt all right you guys because youre going to check for traps as you go go ahead and roll an  investigation check  liam 18  matt okay making your way through there dont appear to be any traps in your way and as you  wind through the path and there is a walked path following the tracks of the people who had set up  the ambush for /dung/ you and heading towards the mountain where kynan had pointed earlier you do  eventually and also watching your sister above and you can see the entrance to this there is a  large volcanicmouthed cavern at the bottom of the mountain before it meets the edge of the jungle  you get to it and its about 40 feet by 20 feet initially and it quickly funnels down all the  rock in here by the way is very dark broken porous volcanic texture it looks like this  mountain at one point in time may have been volcanically /dung/ active or at least may still be  and there isnt sign of any recent activity theres no smoke there is a heavy sulfurous smell  as you get close and actually begin to enter the front of the cave do you guys continue forward  into the cavern  laura is it dark in there  matt yeah theres no light source you guys can still see up to a certain distance okay  without light  laura could i  liam ill check for traps again ill pull out the flame tongue dagger  to get a little /dung/ more light  matt little bit of torch light  laura i set fire to the tip of an arrow and shoot it using oracle shot into the cave  matt okay go ahead and make your investigation check  liam one  matt okay as you instead are distracted by the flaming side of the arrow her lobbing it and  suddenly her eyes just glazing over white it catches you off guard the first time really  seeing this happen and so you werent even paying attention to the rest of the cavern  you all of a /none/ sudden are having an immediate firstperson of the very tip of the arrow coasting  through darkness the fire itself crackling around you like youre wreathed in flame you can hear  the flame licking past your ears almost as you pass through the wind of this still tunnel air  eventually coming down you can see the tunnel condenses and then turns sharply right and you  scatter against the rock fall to the side well see where it lands actually okay you hit the  ground and ahead you can see with a little light that the tunnel /none/ splits into two but there is  theres detail to the walls that doesnt look  natural there is some idea of construction here  there is structure someone has refined elements of the interior of this tunnel thats the best  you can make out with the arrows placement  liam you all right  laura that was cool its a fucking tunnel theres maybe something in there  tearfully i dont know what were doing  i dont know what purpose it serves  liam voice breaking im so sorry  i walk in  matt okay as /none/ you guys continue following the path that the arrow did the tunnel winds back and  forth a bit it pinches and then curves quickly to the right where you find the arrow still lying  there  liam stealth please  matt roll a stealth check  laura can i check for anything that looks out of place any danger or anything  traps if you will  matt make an investigation check  while youre stealthing  liam 25  laura terrible investigation11  matt it seems safe  laura it seems so safe  matt are you /none/ stealthing as well  laura sure 20  matt okay the two of you pushing forward the cavern divides to the right and left eventually  to the right was what you got the glimpse at to the left it just continues the same kind of  porous rock and its like a volcanic tube that general erosion built a floor thats a little less  wide than the walls which are spherical in shape  liam so on the right its natural and on the left its more altered  matt other way  liam other way so one /none/ is natural one is touched  matt to the right where the tunnel curves off you can see what appear to be smoothedover walls  where its been just either ground down theyre not perfectly flat but there has been some amount  of effort put in making it a smoothwalled structure that same burnt sulfur smell is  stronger the deeper into the mountain you go but not to the point where its forcing you to cough  you do feel a little bit of burning in the lungs from proximity  laura are there tracks at all in /dung/ the cave  matt there are a few footfalls going through the dust very hastily theyre like joggingpaced  footfalls and even just from some of the tracking youve done previously in the day some of these  footfalls are of the people that you encountered earlier including ripley  laura i feel like theyve already been in here and she took what she found  liam lets be sure ill take point i start walking down the altered path  laura following the path that we see her footsteps in  matt okay and carefully stepping forward for the /none/ next ten minutes or so it goes from a slightly  curved and bunched rock formation into a singular long tunnel that has been pushed into the mountain  itself and it abruptly comes to an end in here the soft ashy dust that once formed the floor has  given way to crunching of thousands and thousands of tiny bone shards and you see before you what  appears to be a cluster of hundreds of skulls that are built up into one altarlike platform  everything here is burnt and elements of this look like a large fiery /none/ event transpired in here  that destroyed much of what once was a more structured interior and this altar while it  remains in place it look like it suffered severe damage in the past the skulls and rocks that are  there most of them are broken cracked and thrown against the walls this looks very old it looks  like this place hasnt been touched in a very long time  laura anything that looks like a teleportation circle or anything  matt investigation check  laura sighs natural one  liam i got an 18 no i /none/ got a 20  matt you dont find anything that resembles a teleportation circle what you do find is in the  altar it appears that there was a compartment that has since been opened up that is left vacuous  and empty it appears to have been recently disturbed  laura okay this is what ripley took this is where she found the scroll  matt and once you do that looking at the little bit of ashy soot that was on the outside of the  scroll you do get the sense that that was probably what was /none/ taken from this altar  liam do we waste our time with the other passage or do we go back  laura tearfully lets go back  matt eventually you guys make your way back to the rest of the camp youve cleaned up percy to  the best of your ability youve gathered all the materials from all the other corpses around the  battlefield you and kynan return with your onyx dog what are you going to do  sam we sleep  laura super restful just the most restful sleep  sam yeah its going to be /none/ a great night well hang out tell stories about percy cry a bunch  travis not yet  sam yeah youre right all right what time is it how long have we been awake should we let the  airship know so they dont keep hovering  laura yes ill fly over to them  sam we have flares  laura yeah but they might not understand what it means ill fly over to them and tell them what  they can go  sam but we dont i guess is there anything we need from them they can bring /none/ the arm back to  ankharel werent we supposed to bring her arm back to ankharel  laura yeah but there wasnt a time limit on that  sam well mail it  liam well just hold onto it for now  sam okay  laura ill fly up to the airship  matt okay its a little ways south of the island but it was at the ready all of its  various arbalest setups are still ready for war theyre basically just waiting for your guys  order to come and attack as you come to the edge /none/ you see captain damon immediately rush up and  goes we saw some sort of explosion on the island is everyone all right immediately his  expression drops and he steps on to the back of his heels and drops his hands in front of him in a  very businesstype setup im sorry  laura were going to find another way back home you can take the airship back to ankharel  if you want  matt where are you going  laura somewhere with clerics i dont know  matt very good i guess if you need me /none/  and my crew come find us in ankharel  laura of course thank you  matt safe travels crew and he starts shouting out to the rest of everyone on the deck as you  coast off you hear him shouting at a distance over the wind were going home  whatever that is these days  you hear the flare of various magical crystals  the vibration creaks they glow a brighter blue  as the ship turns around  laura oh shit i go back  laughter  marisha did you leave your purse  laura oh /none/ my wallet no but i go back up and i say to captain damon  are you willing to join a fight  matt explain  laura those dragons destroyed our home we could use an airship in the fight against them  matt were outfitted to take down relatively dangerous prey but  laura you wouldnt be fighting alone  matt i mean no offense here and the  honorable goal is fantastic  but i also have a crew to feed  laura of course theres a lot of gold there a lot of riches  matt make /none/ a persuasion roll  laura ive been rolling so well tonight  liam this is the one  laura 20  matt well learn the details later but im happy to help convincing them will take some  coin but where would you like us to go  laura quietly oh shit should i  sam were not there  laura sighs do you know where whitestone is  matt ive not been there but i can figure it out  laura its in the mountains  matt he looks over and you can see teera who is the halfling /none/ with the rotted teeth comes up and  goes i know thats by the alabaster sierras  i can get us there  laura im trusting you with that location  matt all right she bows her head and backs away uncomfortable with the tension  of the situation  captain damon goes well meet you in whitestone  laura thank you  matt safe travels  laura you as well  matt the ship continues making its way southward turning around slowly to start turning more  northeast direction you guys watch as you see the ship go overhead /none/ from the island heading in the  opposite direction of ankharel eventually  vex makes her way back to your location  on the island  sam howd it go with damon  laura were getting married its wonderful  sam i knew it  laura theyre heading to whitestone  sam arent we not supposed to tell anybody about whitestone didnt we have some blood pact  dont ever say the word whitestone  laura we did  sam also isnt it invisible  laura it is  sam great all right well maybe theyll find it anyway  /none/ travis shall we  liam can you do the thing scanman  sam sure ill house it up  matt okay as you summon scanlans magnificent mansion you all come to a familiar space  spectral servants waiting to wait on you but the somber atmosphere still remains you find your way  to your respective rooms and if theres anything youd like to do before the evenings rest  nows the time to speak up  liam hey just an idea everybody remembers when they were kids putting blankets out in the living  room and sleeping i dont /none/ really want to go back to my room want to camp out in the den together  marisha yeah we can make a blanket fort  sam sounds good  laura didnt you ever have blanket forts grog  travis i didnt have blankets  laura well show you how its done  travis fine  liam where do we put percival  travis with us  sam yeah were still a team  marisha that sounds a little weird you guys  sam well were not going to let him sleep alone  well put him on a table /none/ and well all sleep around him on the floor itll be super weird  travis i reach into the bag of holding and i take out one of the ten expensiveass bottles of  wine i take out two of them i decork two  i hand one to vex and one to keyleth and say  itll be a hard night but you both have to sleep drink this and we will attempt to remedy this  when we wake the best thing you can do  for your friend now is to sleep so do that  save /dung/ your tears for later  marisha keyleth also pulls a vex  matt all right  marisha i take out the dagger and i hand it to vex to vax sorry  laura thank you you already said it  you said its mine its mine  i take one of the blankets and i cover up percy  matt you take that and cover him up and put him currently to rest on the ground  kynan is still by the door  liam come here two things one theres blue people all over the place in here  /none/ dont pay them any mind  matt yeah  liam stay in the room but give us a little bit of space  matt of course  liam hey well work it out have faith  matt he doesnt say anything  liam i go back to the group  travis and we sleep  marisha i druidcraft little fireflies above us make it all pretty and sleep too  matt you guys take an evenings rest within the mansion you recover half of your hit die  whatever your maximum hit die is you recover half that for the /none/ evenings rest youre at full hit  points and your spells are returned to you  travis what  laura were normal again  liam well thats debatable  matt grog is at level 15 so you would get back eight of your hit dice that youve spent  laura singsong morning comes  matt all right whats the plan  sam well were recovered howd you guys sleep everyone sleep okay not great  laura can we tree stride keyleth can we go  marisha yes lets go  matt as you guys make your way to the front /none/ door you see kynan is leaning against the wall of the  front his knees pushed to his chest he hasnt slept he has big bags under his eyes  hes just staring at the floor  travis kynan is it do me a favor sulk around this group a little bit later otherwise i might  kill you right now so fall in line and pick your chin up  matt hes not reacting  laura i give him some water  matt he acknowledges as you place it down  he doesnt drink any of it  laura /none/ you should get up were leaving  marisha are we bringing him with us  laura and liam yes  matt he stands up slowly and just follows you like a ghost right now whats the plan  sam got to find a tree  laura go to tree go to sun tree  sam where we going  laura and travis whitestone  sam okay  marisha closest biggest fattest tree  matt it doesnt take you long youve seen a few thatll work in your initial travel into the  jungle here you find one thick jungle tree /none/ thats probably 35 feet up slightly curving at the top  one of the few living trees in this forest its a nice wide solid trunk so its perfect for you to  do this as you all gather around making sure you have everything you need keyleth you reach out  touch and mark the space where the doorway is to open as you finish the casting of your spell the  bark of this striated palm treetype structure falls away into the entrance on the other side  you can see that brief hazy glimmer of a cloudcovered /town/ day at whitestone you all quickly  rush through one after another portal closes behind as you all stand now leaping outside of the  sun tree in the center of the main town square in whitestone it is getting close to  the sun is setting its later in the afternoon  evening  laura do we see anyone around we get pike  we go to pike  marisha pike immediately  matt all right there is still that faint shimmer on the sky above you  travis i have percy over my shoulders fireman carry  matt /none/ as you guys arrive a number of people who live in whitestone  laura what  travis yeah around my shoulders yeah no fireman carry  matt as you guys begin walking away from the sun tree you can see a bunch of townsfolk and some  guards begin to walk up to greet you and be like youve returned immediately the energy is  felt and everyone steps away and gives you space as people begin to see the limp body of percival  being held over grogs shoulder  laura someone should get cassandra  marisha immediately tell /none/ them were coming to prepare quarters  matt right away the guard rushes off up towards the castle whitestone are you guys  walking towards the castle whitestone as well  sam thats where pike is right  laura is she building a temple here  matt there is a temple being built here yes  sam in the castle  matt no the temple would be within the city itself  sam and thats where she was last seen  laura can we try the earrings does pike have her earring  marisha yeah shes got to have her /none/ earring right  laura pike can you hear us  matt pike you who have been suffering a very sleepless night feeling some amorphous heartbreak  that you havent been able to define yet that has prevented you from closing eyes without spells of  sudden anxiety and sadness hear the voice come peeking through and the immediacy of vexs tone  is both comforting and immediately confirming a terrible fright that youve had lingering at the  back of your mind  ashley vex  laura where are you darling  ashley im in the temple where are you /none/ i know somethings wrong  laura tearfully were coming to find you  ashley okay  marisha to sarenraes temple  matt you guys beeline there the temple is still under construction and constructions been slow  due to the scenario that currently exists on taldorei many folks instead are putting a lot of  energy toward defenses and training in case anything bad happens in whitestone there are a  few worshipers that have converted to sarenrae and are helping but pike is still the central place  of what is a basic stone structure that is slowly being /none/ outfitted  as you approach its pretty much a hovel but is making its way as you approach you can see the  front door open and there pikes form long silver and goldcolored evening wear her hair  tousled around her face the little bit of wind thats blowing through causing it to tumble  against one chin she looks out the rest of you with sadness across her eyes  ashley i knew something was wrong where is he  laura we bring him inside  matt you all make your way into this room there are two /none/ other people that are helping around  theyre general townsfolk theyre not heavy  into any specific use aside from cleaning and  helping construct but they bring a large table  out and you guys set percy on top of it  laura pike can you do something can you help him  ashley im going to try  travis were here with you pike  marisha whatever we can do to help we just knew we couldnt do this without you  ashley okay im going to cast resurrection on him  sam resurrection what does that do /none/ does it just bring him back  laura does resurrection just bring him back  matt there are two spells at your disposal there is resurrection which is a 7thlevel spell it  costs a diamond worth 1000 gold which the spell consumes or there is raise dead which is a  5thlevel spell which consumes a diamond worth 500 gold pieces but the target has to have been  dead no longer than ten days  laura okay so we could do that what does resurrection do  matt the same thing but the person could have been dead /none/ for up to a century  marisha is there a better chance with resurrection  matt i would say being a 7thlevel spell i would give a very faint modifier depending  sam i dont know vex we could save 500 gold  laura i bring out the best diamond i have  matt okay  laura i got a whole 40pound bag of gems  sam what was that ash  ashley with raise dead is there sighs what is my question how whole does he come back  matt whole with both spells he comes back whole if /none/ it works  ashley well we could save a little money  laughter  sam no pike no  travis oh how grief does strange things to people  sam or we could buy him a better tombstone if we had the extra money  laura thats terrible scanlan  ashley his glasses are broken we could fix his glasses  laura yeah  liam this is percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii he needs a largeass  diamond pull out the biggest one youve got  laura ive got a thousanddollar diamond  its actually listed in /none/ my items  a thousandgold diamond  ashley lets do it hes a de rolo he deserves the best  matt okay pike you begin to set the stage for the ritual you begin to pull out the sage this  temple as simple as it is but simple is the nature of sarenrae one who does not have much  worshiping influence in this world you know that she requires just enough and the faith is  stronger than the presentation but you pull out the best you can all the offerings that are  necessary you scrawl out /none/ the various divine runic symbols that represent healing that represent  connection to ones divine entity that represent stalwartness and strength of heart that represent  love and family everything you can think of that really binds this ritual to the moment as you  guys are sitting around to prepare you begin the incantation of the ritual the first stage allows  you to reach out and make contact with the spirit wherever it is after five minutes of searching  you have no way of locating it the spirit currently something is blocking it  laura is it /none/ orthax  matt you know its out there you can sense that there is an essence of percival but its like  its blurred and theres something blocking it the rituals unable to reach out  ashley how do i find out what it is  laura is there a way to find out what it is thats blocking it  matt you may have to think about it  ashley insight check or can i  liam religion its orthax  marisha i pull out ripleys gun and i hand it to pike while shes still in her ritual /dung/ and see if  that has any effect  matt as keyleth hands you the gun that strange blockage becomes crystalline what was once a dark  spot that was preventing you from clarifying your vision is now a clear patch of shadow having seen  this once before orthax is indeed blocking the ritual and is currently hungrily feasting on the  soul of percival  sam in the gun  laura how do we draw him out  marisha do we try and destroy the gun again  do we do this again  travis what if we /none/ carve his name back onto the barrel  liam what if we use that scroll to go to him now  sam go to percy  travis or go to orthax  laura we can pull orthax through the gate  liam or kill him on his home turf and kill him for real  marisha hes a shadow fiend does that mean  we have to kill him on his own turf do we know  matt i would say pike make a religion check  and make an intelligence check scanlan  liam can i make a religion /none/ check  matt actually yes you can as well  sam check just a check  ashley 21  sam 11  matt holding this the essence of orthax a shadow demon like this orthax was not destroyed  and sent back to his plane orthax cannot be sent back to its plane when its bound to whatever its  crux is whatever object that orthax has used as its focus holds it in this plane and it cannot be  destroyed on its plane while its attached to that object the gun right now is essentially the  anchor /none/ that orthax is using  laura we need to destroy the gun  matt destroy the gun or find a way to break the connection  travis didnt you detach craven edge from me didnt you sever a thread didnt that happen  laura can you reach out can you do that  travis yeah  marisha pike did that right  sam howd you do that pikey  ashley im trying to remember  travis i dont even remember  and it happened to me  sam well you were dead werent you  travis no excuse  marisha /none/ wasnt it a somethingevil spell  sam could we throw the gun into the little hole under whitestone castle  liam there also still acid  laura yeah what if we brought the gun in front  of the circle it cancels out the magic of it  marisha throw it in the circle  laura or just bring in there  marisha is it an arcane magic like that  laura i dont know we could try  sam there is acid we could do the same exact thing  liam and repeat history scanlan  ashley i think /none/ it was greater restoration  travis that was right thats what severed it  matt you want to try a greater restoration spell is that what youre saying  sam on what  travis on the gun  sam can you do that to an object  matt yeah thats what she did for  travis she could see a thread  that was connecting us  matt what are you doing pike  ashley to the gun is that even going to make  any sense  marisha pike i can try greater restoration if you want to save /dung/ your healing magic  do you want me to try it  ashley i mean in case this doesnt work  marisha ill try to recreate what pike did to grog  matt you take animus from her the pepperbox and even holding it there is this dark weight to it  it feels like lead and cold in your hands as you concentrate channeling the divine druidic  energies that currently youre focusing into it  your vision comes to a similar dark shadowy  mass that pike had seen during the attempt at the resurrection ritual you can /none/ see there is indeed a  connection there is a tangible gateway between this weapon and orthax the shadow demon  there enveloped in the darkness you can sense  in your heart of hearts thats where percy lies  as you begin to focus on greater restoration you begin to feel the nature of the curse that binds  him to it and you reach out in this space you guys watch as keyleth reaches out into the air of  nothing but within your sight and your vision you can see that thread and you grasp it  /none/ as you hold it with your fingers you feel it  fight you watch as keyleths hand bolts around  with nothing in her grasp you hear the voice  whisper no no i finally have him i finally  and with that you snap with your fist  the shadow screams and vanishes  and there you see a brief glimmer of light  the remaining spirit of percival  as it drifts off into the astral sea  marisha i scream percy  matt the spell finishes the gun itself you guys see a flash of shadow around /none/ it and it dulls  all the names on the side vanish as well  the barrels are now clean  marisha pike do it  ashley i continue working on the  resurrection spell  matt okay as you go back into this ritual that blockage is gone now and you can see clear  the somewhat tatteredaroundtheedges but whole  and existing soul of percival the ritual makes  connection and with that that coldness becomes a warmth and a familiarity as you reach out and  implore the spirit to take your attention and come back  /none/ now who wants to aid in this resurrection ritual  who has something to offer  as a part of this skill challenge  sam i would like to inspire her at least is that something that will help  matt inspiring whoever wants to be part of the ritual yeah you can go ahead and inspire  laura can i reach forward and look in percys coat for that condensed whitestone  that he carries  matt sure go ahead and make an investigation check  marisha hey vex will you look for that raven skull that i gave /none/ him while youre at it  laura sure 25  matt 25 you start rummaging through his coat and you find his gun retort you find a bunch of  random bullet casings and bullets you find a cluster of papers and notes that are folded up in  a small book and what appears to be a partially sealed letter with no name on it  laura nothing else  matt you eventually find some of the whitestone glass the green glass that you guys had flashed  around in ankharel  marisha does he still have the raven /none/ skull on him that i gave him  matt the raven skull is still on him it hangs around his neck yeah  travis what is that  laura he says its supposed to amplify magic right  sam i think  laura so i put it on his chest  matt all right what do you want to offer to the skill challenge for this event something that you  as an individual bring to this and bring to the connection to percy to try and  laura shakily i say percy i dont know if you can hear /none/ me but that day in syngorn was one of  the best moments of my life and not because of what you think it wasnt because of my father or  the title it was because of whitestone it was because of you you allowed me to be a part of the  thing that you hold dearest and i was so proud but i dont want to be here if youre not  whitestone still needs you darling i still need you here and i lean down and i kiss him  and i say  i should have /none/ told you its yours  matt make a persuasion roll  laura natural 20  matt i trust you okay who else wants to add something to this ritual  sam matt would i inspire pike or percy  matt if you want to inspire pike pike could attempt to bring something to the ritual and then  could use your inspiration die on top of what her check is  sam i see all right ill inspire pike then  i assume shes going to bring something  to the ritual right i assume  ashley okay  matt /none/ so how do you inspire  sam i inspire her the only way i know how  which is being an ass so ill inspire her  with a shitty limerick  i know a gunman with a white coifa who acted evil and had a bad cougha  he learned that someone had possessed his big gun  so i threw that shit in the lava  laughter  matt all right you have a d12 inspiration die pike what do you want to try and bring to the  ritual on top of your casting the spell to /none/ draw him back what do you want to bring  to the ritual  ashley i dont know i mean the love that we have for him i dont know  tearfully this is so stressful  matt i know you being the pious woman you are what youve used in the past religion has been  optional your connection with sarenrae in this is important if there are other skills you can think  of that youd want to bring to this as well that youre good at that would fit this circumstance  you can try anything how /none/ well it fits will depend on how high the difficulty class is  ashley right i think clearly i would hope that sarenrae would come in and step in  and help in this  laura can you sing can you sing pike like you did for that little boy percy joined you then  ashley i could  sam didnt you have that thing that brings your god to help once a day  laura divine intervention  ashley can i use that along with this  matt ill let you yeah  ashley well heck yes  matt /none/ all right roll a d10 let me know what you roll first  ashley okay  matt whatd you roll  ashley i rolled a three  matt okay sarenrae is with you but the intervention the divine gate that separates the  gods from the prime material plane still stands shes lending what energy she can in this moment  imploring to her and the connection you do have through the divine gate i want you to go ahead  and make a religion check roll a d20 and add your religion modifier  ashley come on 18  /none/ matt okay do you want to add your d12 inspiration from scanlan  ashley yes thats ten an extra ten so what did i say 28  matt all right gotcha one final skill challenge check to make who wishes to add to this  liam i have a notion but you are very close to him  marisha i grab the skull from around his neck that i gave him i say percy we had many  conversations about life and death and in many ways you were my total opposite but you are also  my best friend /none/ even though i told you that day that i gave you this that were all going to die  and that you can still be saved from yourself it was clear the journey was far from over and it  still isnt and then im going to cast conjure woodland beings and im going to have a barrage  of crows come from around me im going to tell him as much as you might think your journey is  over just because yours might be ours isnt and we need you and i need you  liam i kneel /none/ at his head and shoot out the wings and lend them to percival like the crow he is  like a cloak  matt im going to say between the two of you on that i need you to make a charisma ability check  with advantage because of vax helping you this is in particular a challenge for you because  persuasions already been used you as your point of leadership and strength of character youre  piercing through the veil and through the ritual to appeal to him as a person to another through  sheer force of /none/ charismatic persuasion with advantage adding your charisma bonus  marisha use the gold die percy 19  matt 19 you feel pike the ritual begin to culminate the divine energies lent to you by  sarenrae fill your form and you watch as pikes physical form now seems to overlap her divine form  youve had at a distance she is this radiant golden image of herself the same golden wings  flaring up around her you watch as percys body begins to rise off the table the arms and legs  limply hanging underneath the chest rising up the /dung/ light from pike begins to create a small well  of divine energy that spirals down into his chest and blasts through him and the table the table  itself cracks beneath him yet he still remains aloft as the energy hits  the energy fades the ritual completes the room grows still and cold and dark once more pikes  divine form disperses into golden feathers that drift and disappear across the wooden floor  percys body slowly lands onto the table stillness stillness  inhalation breaths begin  to fill his chest once more unconscious as he is /none/ life is slowly returning to percival as is color  his pale skin pale as its ever been but now slowly stirring  ashley sighs with relief  laura laughs pike  matt ill take a picture of that just so everyone knows  laura taliesin get your butt in here  sam hes so quiet we should just let him sleep  ashley this is too fucking much man  sam pike youre in a temple dont curse  ashley i dont care  laura percy  marisha you said hes still unconscious  matt still unconscious  liam /none/ oh well i cast lay on hands and take him out of that right away ten hit points  matt percival get back in your chair  travis get your monkey ass back in that chair  sam but  taliesin ive been watching south park i dont know about the rest of you  liam no hamlet death for you  matt let me tweet out the photo real fast  laura i feel like we need to take a break can we take our break im going to throw up  matt actually this would be a great /none/ time to go ahead and take a break were going to go ahead  and go take a quick break  laura good job ashley  sam ashley you did it you have one job ashley one job  taliesin two jobs  matt those were some good rolls man and apparently a convincing i was literally waiting  for a text from taliesin to let me know based on how the ritual went whether or not percival felt  it was enough to bring him back even if it would have succeeded  taliesin you guys could have fucked /none/ it up so bad it would have been great  matt well be back here in a number of minutes  marisha hoarsely did we say the right thing clearly  taliesin ill tell you when the cameras off  liam listen all we know is half the audience is going to be furious  laughter  matt all right guys well see you here in a few minutes  break  matt welcome back everyone so diving right back in  percival freshly breathing on the table in the partially constructed small temple to sarenrae in  the city /none/ of whitestone apparently successful his spirit restored you come to consciousness as a  tiny hand is smacking you in the face  sam its like that little doll hand on snl  taliesin can i use my missile grab again  matt yes you can  taliesin i do not open my eyes  sam hes awake hes alive ow  taliesin and i slap him in the face  marisha his reflexes are working his reflexes are working great  taliesin gasping  laura welcome back  taliesin hoarsely where are we  sam your home our home /none/  laura oh shit can you see are his glasses broken  matt his glasses are cracked  taliesin but i can see fine im nearsighted  i dont feel well  liam you want to feel better  taliesin yes  liam ripley is dead  taliesin thank you  sam deader than dead shes torn asunder we have parts of her  taliesin thats good news theres only one part we need well two  sam two  taliesin did we keep both her hands  laura we did  sam i thought one was a fake  /none/ taliesin id like to see it  sam okay all right thats a weird request when you just wake up  taliesin not now  liam yeah your sisters going to be running up in here very soon  taliesin oh god no im going to lie back down  matt at which point the door slams open and cassandras there with what appears to be seeker  asum and a couple of the guards from whitestone where is he is he all right  taliesin im going to throw up  matt oh hes all right  laughter  /none/ matt you scared me i heard he was  laura everythings fine dear  matt she walks up to you at the table and leans over and stop getting into trouble brother  please  taliesin well just a few more dragons and ill take a break itll be fine im tired  matt she runs her fingers through your hair a couple of times and looks down her stern  expression melts into a warmth and appreciation and she feels the coldness of the body and goes  you can see her putting together the setup the ritual your /dung/ emotional state and the damp cheeks  she looks over towards you pike and nods and says thank you  ashley youre welcome  taliesin sighs heavily  matt get some food in you and stop being so bloody useless and slaps you upside the face and  turns around and leaves the temple  taliesin if everybody had just slapped my face while i was dead that would have been so much  more convenient  laura who says we didnt  liam that wasnt the worst of it  taliesin no it was really not i am very /none/ tired  sam well you spent last night on a table which is much beneath a man of your station  marisha percy you were gone for quite a while  taliesin how long  laura a day  taliesin only a day  sam yeah  marisha how long did it feel  taliesin i dont know  travis what do you remember  taliesin nothing worth repeating  marisha i beg to differ  sam i wanted to use a gate spell to save you instantly but everyone else in the group said no  they wanted to /none/ save it for something else  laughter  sam i stood up for you when you were down and they turned their backs on you i give him a big  hug and i say i think that entitles me to one of the guns that we found just one of them  the smallest one you can teach me how to use it  on weekends  taliesin well discuss this  sam its a hard yes im expecting  laughter  liam laughter laughters back  taliesin it was not pleasant thank you  thank you for what /none/ you did  marisha what  taliesin i saw what you did  marisha what do you mean you saw what i did  taliesin it was the only thing i saw  marisha did you hear me yell for you  taliesin no but i saw your hand  thank you sighs  marisha percy  taliesin yes im glad that thats not waiting for me any more  marisha are you sure  laura is he gone  marisha do you still feel him  taliesin i havent felt him in a long time i stopped feeling him /none/ after you did what you did  and then there was nothing and then i was here but in between i did feel him quite a bit  id rather not think about it at the moment  marisha you should rest and get better  taliesin i think im going to rest  liam bedtime percy  taliesin hello pike  ashley hi  taliesin i dont suppose youve had time to read any of those books  ashley ive read all of them just all of them ive had lots of time on my hands  travis i /none/ want to insightcheck pike  laughter  matt roll an insight check pike roll a deception check  ashley yes here we go  matt whatd you roll  travis 11  ashley all right  matt pike whatd you roll a deception check  ashley laughs four  laughter  matt shes lying through her fucking teeth grog  travis pike  ashley hey it was a joke trying to make everyone laugh  taliesin you just lied to me im so proud of you  ashley im learning  taliesin im so proud of you  travis that /none/ was very clever pike  taliesin you should do that more often  ashley i give percy a big hug  taliesin groans  ashley please dont do that again  taliesin i can make no promises oh that hurts hi  travis did you thank her for the necklace  taliesin thank you for the necklace that was  ashley not enough  taliesin no apparently just enough because here we are and shes been dealt with so it was just  enough sighs im very tired  marisha you should sleep and well talk more tomorrow  taliesin /none/ im going to not sleep in here wherever this is  marisha no this is still a construction zone  taliesin is this what youve been building  ashley yes i know it still needs some work its not very cozy yet but its coming around  taliesin i dont know if cozy is really the point im going to lie down somewhere soft  travis we should all go back to the castle then  marisha ill go dump a few healing spells and stuff into him lets get you to lie down first  matt so you go /none/ and heal him up you guys make your way back to the castle the guards are there  waiting as you enter you can see there sitting in the foyer talking and discussing is jarett  and gilmore who both look a little nervous and intense about apparently recently hearing what  happened as soon as you enter gilmore turns i take that as a good sign hes standing  taliesin i am literally using my gun as a crutch  matt oh come here you whitehaired fool then he runs forward and lifts you up with a hug that /none/  hurts so much he holds you up for a second and sets you back down i know that hurt  laughter  matt and what did we learn dont get killed again  taliesin third times the charm in theory should we show them what we got  sam what do we have  marisha you heal 48 hit points by the way  taliesin thank you i dont even know what hit point level im at  matt youd be at one  taliesin im at 49  laura what do we have to show them  travis /none/ we have two vestiges to show them  laura oh shit i havent even looked at the cloak i tucked it away  taliesin we have two vestiges  laura i pull out the cloak  matt okay  sam get it identified  matt gilmore goes i see youve also been prolific here let me have a look he takes the cloak and  folding it over his hands you see the sparkle of energy through the blue inside of it hes like  very interesting he puts his hand over it and his eyes flare with arcane energy /none/ this is indeed  cabals ruin one of the vestiges of divergence well to be specific about this once attuned  to whoevers wearing it you have advantage on  saving throws against spells and other magical  effects which is pretty badass if i do say so myself also when youre hit by some sort of  assholes spell out there you can use your  reaction to have the cloak swallow part of it  you halve the damage you take from the spell  if theres any damage to be taken  and the cloak gains a /none/ number of charges equal to  the spell level of the triggering spell  liam all this arcane terminology is fascinating  matt its the filter of game rules you dont get a vestige now you get whisper keyleth  laughter  matt essentially what this does is you can use your reaction to swallow a spell if youre hurt by  one even if youre not hurt by it you can still swallow a spell you can only use it once per  short rest but it does half damage to you and  static from ashleys microphone  /none/ liam excuse you  matt it gains a number of charges equal to the spell level that you absorb up to a maximum of  six charges can be stored in the cloak so six charges if you have the cloak on and you hit with  an attack you can expend any number of charges from the cloak to deal an additional 1d6 lightning  damage per charge  laura so you could do an additional 6d6 lightning damage  matt yeah onto an attack that you deal with the cloak thats what cabals ruin does  sam does /none/ it have to be a magic user to wear it  matt no in fact it doesnt channel through spells it channels through physical attacks  marisha oh melee attacks  matt melee weapon attacks is how  the enchantment works  sam groggy percy  laura grog in a cloak  liam percy youd look pretty swag in that  taliesin i would  sam but you already have a vestige  taliesin i do  sam no groggy so does this go to percy  liam yeah this is

that  marisha we told them youre doing great and we told them you were doing fantastic and wonderful  and successful  matt well thank you when all this is done i should go visit its /none/ been a while  liam they seem very proud of you  matt taken a while  sam they told us you werent pottytrained until you were six is that true  matt give me your dagger he takes it runs his fingers on the blade the slight curvature to it  out there to the point he does his identify forged with a mercurial metal pulled from the far  realm light dances and shifts across this curved blade it has a plus three bonus to attack and  damage rolls made with the dagger it also deals an /none/ additional 1d8 psychic damage on a hit  whenever whisper is thrown you can choose to transform into shadow and merge with the blade  teleporting instantly to wherever the blade impacts which means you can teleport as far as  you can throw the dagger which is the max range of the dagger yeah so 60 feet you go wherever  it throws to if the target is a creature you emerge adjacent to the target in a space of your  choice around the creature whenever you critically hit a creature with an attack with  whisper the /none/ target has to make a wisdom saving throw against a dc 18 or become frightened of you  for one minute  liam well its either pike or me  laughter  laura what about keyleth  matt its up to you guys  liam youre going to fight with a little you want it  marisha ive been practicing my juggling to be fair i could use it in my knife juggling yeah  no what am i going to do with it  travis i honestly would like to make a case for it just consider one thing /none/ i chase people around  the battlefield and i really have a hard time getting to them sometimes itd be really great to  travel 50 feet then throw another 60 and then be right on their fucking asses  marisha do they happen in the same turn they happen in the same turn yeah  matt yeah the minute you throw and hit something it immediately teleports you if you  choose it doesnt have to happen you could throw it and then it hits the ground and you stay where  you are if you want to but /none/ if you choose you can travel with the blade and essentially appear  nightcrawlerstyle in shadow next to whatever you hit  liam this knife is so sexy though and you are so invulnerable to everything  travis im just saying for consideration obviously daggers are your bag baby  liam what if  sam you arm wrestle for it  liam no what give him this im considering giving you my cloak instead  sam haste no  laura your armor  liam

sutra  laughter  taliesin i think that one folds out thats quite nice  sam oh ooh  liam oh its a popup book  laughter  travis scanlan isnt there anything else you need to deliver to one of these /none/ two fine  gentlemen  sam i dont think so  travis no i believe there is something you acquired for one of these two gents  sam ixnay on the icespay there are authorities around  travis why are you calling spice icespay  sam grog if someone hears you talking about this shit you could be in deep trouble  taliesin i literally am the law here  i am literally the living embodiment  of law and justice  sam jarett  matt yes im glad to hear everyone is doing okay and its good to see /none/ you here in one piece  how was your journey  sam it was great quietly do you spice  matt right  sam we

a lot of fusaka thank you very much that lasts a long time  laura he spent 50 gold on it  matt you paid 50 gold for /none/ this  sam for the pair  matt oh you got swindled my friend  laughter  matt but i appreciate it its very thoughtful  sam it was worth it to see the smile on your face  matt well thank you  sam ill keep this bag if thats all right with you ive grown quite accustomed to the stuff  its really quite lovely  matt great ill give you some tips on how  to prepare it but you know what ill cook  a classic marquesian feast in the coming  days for all of /none/ us in thank you for the spice  laura thank you  liam oh jarett  matt yes  liam this is kynan  matt whos been ghosting you guys the whole time looking extremely nervous  liam kynan has been telling me that he wanted to help protect whitestone he hasnt anywhere to  live he needs something to do with his time and he has a fire in his belly and wants to serve  matt all right a friend of you is a friend of ours you are ablebodied  kynan is taken aback by the whole /none/ thing his eyes are wide still staring at you slowly he starts  talking out the side of his mouth to jarett yes anything whatever i can do  jarett walks up and puts his hand on his shoulder and goes well first off you need to be more  assertive you are talking like a sniveling coward you need to project your chest shoulders  back and when you speak you speak with intent and ah its late well work on it tomorrow  taliesin i may have a thought for the boy later  matt oh before i /none/ forget this came for you keyleth  marisha what now  laura a letter  sam singing letters we got letters  matt traders came in a parcel in your name dont know who its from  marisha what did they look like  sam how did they get through the invisible wall  marisha how do they know my name  matt i dont know they were sent from westruun i think it was  travis oh shit open that  laura what is it  marisha its got something thick in it which isnt  sam could be /none/ a seal  matt read the letter first  marisha read the letter first  sam its in marquesian  marisha its long  patrick rothfuss offscreen keyleth i write to let you and your companions know that the repair  of westruun is proceeding well i will not bore you with the details suffice to say that our  children are wellfed and safe our elderly and infirm are cared for and comfortable without the  help of you and yours this would not be the case  the folk in charge argue constantly but that is to be /town/ expected and it is no bad thing they all  want the same good things in different ways i listen mostly and do what i can to make sure  that they listen to each other without listening nothing good can happen  the town when i say the repair is going well it is a hard thing for me to talk about i am not a  particularly clever man and much of this is new to me when you make a mistake with metal you can  melt things down and start afresh it is irritating and it /none/ costs in time and soot and  sweat but it can be done there is a comfort in iron knowing that a fresh start is always  possible but a city is not a sword it is a living thing and living things defy simple  fixing roots cannot be reforged they scar and broken branches must be cut and sealed with tar  and this makes me angry as it always has and my anger has no place to go  it was easier when i was young i could use my anger like a hammer against the world /none/ i was so  sure of myself and my friends and my rightness i would hammer at the world and breaking felt like  making to me and i was good at it and while i was not wrong neither was i entirely right  nothing is simple i do not work in wood i am not brave enough for that there is a comfort in iron  a promise of safety a second chance if mistakes are made but a city is more a forest than a  sword no it needs more tending than that perhaps a city /none/ is like a garden then  so these days it seems i have become a gardener i dig foundations in the earth i sow rows of  houses i plan and plant i watch the skies for rain and ruin i cannot help but think that you  would be better at this but circumstance has put both of us in our own odd place you are forced to  be a hammer in the world and my ungentle hands are learning how to tend a plot of land  we must do what we can do  did you /none/ know that there are some seeds that cannot sprout unless they are first burned a friend once  told me that she was she was a bookish sort i think of gardening constantly these days i wear  your gift and i think of you and i think it is interesting that there are some living things that  need to pass through fire before they flourish  i ramble you have the heart of a gardener and because of this you think of consequence and  your current path pains you i am not wise and i do not /none/ give advice but i have come to know a few  things sometimes breaking is making even iron can start again and there are many things that  move through fire and find themselves much better for it afterward  i have enclosed a gift once it was a sword but it has changed it is a small thing and silly  please forgive an old man for his foolishness still i hope it brings you some small comfort  kindly kerr  marisha hoarsely holy shit  sam whats the thing  marisha i dont know what to say /none/  liam are you all right  marisha it was kerr  laura is he proposing to you  laughter  marisha its got branches on it  taliesin its quite beautiful  sam does it say something  marisha i have passed through fire  laura wow motherfucker thats cool  marisha this is a lot to deal with right now we have friends i have a friend  laura youre becoming a wonderful leader keyleth  marisha and as kind as his letter was i think something was wrong and i think theres more to  his message /none/ vex maybe you he scribbled out some words  laura let me see  marisha and speaks vaguely in areas around them  laura cant tell  liam those are called words grog  laura i dont know maybe he just didnt like what he wrote  matt make an insight check vex  laura natural 20  matt looking at handwriting and the way its scribbled out the scribble is hastily and little  bits of text that come through it appears that they are just thoughts that he may have felt  uncomfortable putting in the letter after /none/ writing them out and then scratched them out there  doesnt appear to be any serious agency or danger around them  laura i think its fine keyleth  marisha you sure i worry  laura i think he perhaps bared his heart a little too much  marisha what do you mean  laura maybe he said things he thought better of  marisha i dont know what to say its really comforting to know that not everyone hates us  laura speaking of i did have captain damon bring his airship here is that stupid  taliesin no /none/ no thats not a bad idea we need a better way of communicating with them and im  rethinking did you collect everything from the battle  sam yes  taliesin good that is a discussion we should have in private downstairs perhaps in the  morning bring everything downstairs and have a discussion with cassandra and anybody we trust  laura yes we should sleep you should you look very tired  travis what time of the day is it right now  matt its getting later in the evening close to 10pm comparably even though you guys woke /none/ up  maybe three hours ago  laura jetlag man itll get you i dont know what to do  taliesin we can have this conversation tonight im going to feel miserable for a while  marisha i dont think its a wise idea  travis yeah we could certainly let you sleep  sam we do have to start planning for the next leg of our journey  liam its true but percy needs to go the fuck to sleep seriously  taliesin i will admit i fear sleep at the moment  laura how about some coffee then /none/  liam jack him up first  taliesin how am i physically at the moment  matt physically youre sore and youre drained the essence of the ritual and the following  healing spells youre physically whole but there is a very physical toll on you from the  ritual as well  taliesin so im not filled with holes or anything  matt no but you feel like a walking bruise and every movement of your body is fraught with such  physical exhaustion that you havent felt and only time is going to take care of that youre /none/  effectively at minus four to any d20 rolls you make until you rest then it becomes a minus  three then another nights rest becomes a minus two so youre in a rough spot for the next few  days unless youre resting consistently  taliesin sighs we do have to have a conversation about all that we either have it now  or later  travis take a fucking nap man well convene in the morning  liam youre outvoted percy go to bed  marisha you literally just rose from the dead  taliesin im going to /none/ need new clothes  liam nobody wants to talk to you right now we want you to go to sleep were going to go have a  drink and have a fabulous time well see you in the morning  taliesin right ill see you in the morning im going to go up to my room and pass out  matt for the brief moment you have consciousness as you enter the room it is a wondrous welcoming  sight you have just enough time to get that thought across before you facedown in your bed and  right to /none/ sleep clothes still on facedown from the corner of the bed its a terrible sight but  you dont care the rest of you what do you wish to do  laura i give pike a huge hug  travis yeah  ashley i give everybody a big hug  travis yeah little pike  ashley with my gauntlets on so a big bear hug  matt it hurts a little and youre proud of her for it  ashley growls  travis yeah i give her a fist bump with the gauntlets and the knuckles  matt it actually /none/ causes this strange collision shockwave it pushes you back a second because  theres too much strength in one fistbump  travis oh pike youre getting too strong for your own good  ashley laughs hey  laughter  ashley oh man should we all have a drink or something  liam jarett shaun can you get away  matt shaun goes for a moment maybe i should probably rest as well jarett  jarett goes you know what yes drink sounds nice its been a while good company  liam kynan come on  matt kynans still in shock /none/ and nods and slinks as he walks behind you he walks with his head low  and you can see he averts his gaze towards the ground watching where hes going to be walking  gilmore individually gives you all a brief hug or handshake im sure well talk more tomorrow  im going to go join percys plan of action  travis can i walk over to vax so im assuming youre taking this little chick under your wing  liam well im not taking him with us to draconia or anywhere no  travis no but youre sure /none/ hes clean  liam i might like to have pike take a look at him in the morning but i think so  travis hes pretty spaced out  laura why doesnt pike look at him now are you tapped pike  ashley no who is this guy  matt you recognize him pike as you say that looking at him though much more harrowed a  little more built than you last saw him but this is the young man who was waiting for you guys  outside of greyskull keep a few months back asking to join who /none/ was brighteyed  and inexperienced  liam and i clocked him  ashley oh yeah hi again  matt hi its one of the things where hes always looking down but you step into his field  of vision already being shorter than him as youre looking up at him with your gauntlets there  at your side hes looking at you but hes also not wanting to look you in the eyes a little bit  hello pike its good to see you  ashley good to see you  travis pike do us a favor and give him /none/ a onceover make sure theres no funk on him  laura he was traveling with ripley pike  ashley he was probably what  laura he was traveling with ripley oh no  sam she froze she froze in a weird position  laughter  matt welcome back we had a bit of a technical difficulty there but apparently were back up  and streaming and everythings good so were going to jump right back into the story  where we were  sam i am currently holding gilmores severed head in my hands right blood spilled dripping  matt /none/ just gouts of it animestyle like fist of the north star spraying  laura and percys dead again  sam percy died yeah percy died  marisha yeah hes gone ive cried eight more times  laura my bad sorry  sam we need to resurrect him ready one two three  yelling  marisha thanks vesh  travis were having pike check  matt so having pike check kynan kynans looking at you pike what are you going to do  ashley im going to detect evil  matt okay looking over and you finish the spell there is /none/ no sense of evil from him make an  insight check ill say with advantage because of the nature of the spell because why not  laughter  laura because you are all powerful and you can do that  matt because he is a broken man standing before you  ashley okay 28  matt you dont sense any evil in the sense of what the spell would gather you do sense from  looking at his expression his reaction and what bit of information you have this is a person  thats been heavily brainwashed and their idea /none/ of what the world was or as it was has been broken  probably many times kynans in a rough spot and the guilt is weighing so heavily on him right now  that its probably best that somebody keep an eye on him  ashley i put my hand on his shoulder and i say kynan you look like a man who feels like hes  made a mistake and you just need to turn that frown upside down  laughter  sam wise  matt looking down at your smiling blue gnomish eyes this broken boy of a /none/ man does mutter a  slight chuckle in reaction then catches himself and nods i have a lot to think about  i have a lot of penance to deal with thank you  ashley youre welcome  matt maybe a drink would help  ashley of course that always helps  matt jarett smacks him on the shoulder all right then lets get this pup trashed follow me  he leads you down to one of the two taverns the one that had been destroyed as part of the  initial battle here in whitestone has been constructed the /none/ roofs still mostly missing but  they have a covering over it it doesnt appear to be a rainy evening so it should be fine theres  a handful of folk in there having drinks jarett treats you all to a round of finer ale of  whitestone brand they dont have a large selection of rare imported drinks here but its  enough to at least get the job done anything you guys want to do specifically while youre all  having drinks tonight  travis wait jarett while we were in your hood i acquired this delicious little /none/ bit and i pull  out the sandkheg bottle this is called seraphs swine swallow and i pour a little into a glass  and i hand it to him  matt he goes i am not familiar with this  you say this is from ankharel  travis yeah and its all in one hit the back of the throat and swallow it all in one  matt to friends  travis yes to friends and to health  matt and to survival  travis and to fukasa sukasa mi casa  laughter  matt make a deception check /none/  travis 14  matt he gives you a keen look looks to vex nods to friends and trust  liam its so worth it  travis i take his cup i pour a little and im like cant let him take this ride by himself  i pound it as well  matt make a constitution saving throw  laura oh no  travis not great 13  matt the fiery rumble in your stomach is matched directly behind by the heavy flow of numbness that  fills the entirety of your chest jaw and tongue  jarett goes /tavern/  heavily slurred that was quite strong  travis slurred i think so too  matt slurred you fucker  laughter  matt slams the glass down slurred well im not going to have any conversation for a while  laughter  travis slurred youre talking really funny lets braid each others hair  matt please dont i think that i have far more than you do and its too short anyway  be a waste of your time  he became castilian suddenly  liam i get three drinks at the bar and i walk past keyleth and leave /none/ one on the table by her and  go and sit down by kynan i want to show you something i bought these months ago and i root  around in my pack and i pull out the three finely made daggers that i bought  laura they were expensive  liam shes right they were expensive im actually not going to give them to you tonight  because youre worrying me a little bit but in a day or two these are yours i bought these for  you months ago i looked for you i visited the butcher /none/ shop and i missed you im very sorry  about that i wish that this had not i wish this had not played out the way it had  matt me too  liam you can atone it is not too late i see the look in your eye it is not too late  matt he keeps looking over at keyleth and you see every time he sees her he has that spike of  guilt in his heart  marisha yeah you better motherfucker  liam you fucked up clearly big time and you can either curl in /none/ on yourself and rot in a ball  or you can make up for it you know whats going on in taldorei you know whats going on i spent  too much time looking inward its pointless  be of use  matt make a persuasion check  liam im going to use luck that is a 17  matt most of this conversation his eyes have been darting away from connecting with yours the  evasion has been persistent but as soon as those words finish his eyes finally lock with yours and  stay with you he takes /none/ a beat and goes i know what ive done and theres no way i can express  how sorry i am the woman i followed she was confident she was persuasive and she picked up  what others wouldnt and i bought into that  and that shows once again that i was never ready  to begin with like you said and i appreciate  that wisdom in hindsight  liam i was kind of a dick  matt you were kind of a dick but still ill do my best i cant make any promises  but ill /dung/ do my best  liam thats all any of us can do  matt yeah  liam youre battered youre not broken  do better  matt okay  liam drink up  matt you guys share a silent drink  marisha i shoot him daggers whenever his eyes meet mine at one point  matt and he immediately goes back to his drink and takes another sip  all oh no  matt were living in the broken future of technology thank you for your patience so as  kynans avoiding eye contact with keyleth and getting progressively drunk /none/ as the evening goes  on occasionally you see him smile hearing other bits of conversation the positive presence at  least of you guys being somewhat forgiving in the moment and the fact that percy did come back  alleviated some of his guilt hes doing better than he was earlier definitely but hes still  very inward  jarett is having hilarious conversation with grog as it progresses slurred it is great to have  all of you back and i hope my hometown was very kind to all of you i do miss it and perhaps when /none/  all this is said and done and i can get  a proper maybe a writ of approval  from you folks here at whitestone  maybe they can absolve me of a couple of things  on the books i would like to say goodbye to  travis slurred i cant understand what youre saying  matt slurred i cant understand what im saying where did you get this  travis slurred it is the best  matt slurred its pretty great  ashley what is it  laura oh pike  marisha pike you have to try /none/ some  travis slurred pike do you want a little bit  matt slurred you have to have some its not very tasty ill tell you that  but let me tell you what it will do is this  ashley thats okay you dont drink alcohol for the taste  travis thats my monster and i pour her a little glass  matt all right do you down the shot pike  ashley well yeah  laughter

ashley oh shit laughs i just rolled a one  laughter  matt so pike takes the second shot slams the drink down on the table you feel the numbness hit  your lips pike and you feel a little strange a little sparkly and numb for a second your tongue  isnt quite functioning as you would hope as everyones looking towards you  slurred a second shot that is obviously  very brave of you pike  travis slurred yes shes got quite the tolerance  ashley well i thought it i dont even know garbled /none/ speech  laughter  matt and with that pike faceplants onto the ground and passes the fuck out  laughter  laura oh no pike  travis slurred pike pike  ashley i got too cocky  travis can i try to pick her up by her collar and try to hold her up is she just limp  matt shes limp in your grasp man shes snoring loudly too  travis slurred well thats one way to go for the night  matt slurred i think this is an important lesson for all of us at least the two /none/ of us  no more of that  travis yeah no i put it in the bag of holding slurred did you know that it comes from a  venomous part of a big animal  matt slurred you should have prefaced that  before we had a drink  travis slurred didnt i say that that was my fault  matt slurred its fine too late now  travis i go lay pike in a booth or something  matt shes slumped over  laughter  matt anything else you guys wish to accomplish while

like this to be in your voice  taliesin no it was never supposed to be in my voice  liam my friends i have just taken an audience with the raven queen who has snuffed any hope of  my redemption for which i am truly grateful with new clarity i can finally /none/ see my life as a series of  compounding poor choices there was nothing i could have done to save my family yet i still  sold my soul in search of vengeance later i allowed ripley to leave knowing full well she was  a greater threat to the world than the briarwoods would ever be i traded the worlds safety for the  belief that i could murder my way to peace that if i could be a greater horror it would bring my  family back once this lie was shattered i scrambled to find a solution /none/ to make a deal to  undo my mistakes and balance the scales i now understand that there are no scales there is no  redemption and no ledger that judges me good or evil i am free to simply be myself and live with  the terrible mistakes ive made  tomorrow i start upon a new path beyond the gods and demons who have tormented me and its your  friendship that makes this possible though a shadow lingers the need for vengeance is gone  i will try and do my best for you all i will /none/ strive to buy the future more time free of my legacy  i will stand against the children of my madness in hope rather than in anger and if you are  reading this then my travels on this path have come to an end  scanlan thank you for destroying my gun do not let the weight of lifes consequences crush your  bravado it is your greatest weapon  grog remember that your compassion has brought you this far not just strength for the record  i would have wiped the floor with you that time  vax /none/ you often remind me of myself and yes i know that that is a bit of an insult stop  indulging your desire to sacrifice and try being the man that these two women seem to think you  are they may actually need you one day  vex you often remind me of myself and
