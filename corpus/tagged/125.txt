well all right  matt thats really awesome happy birthday both of you guys after the fact yay all right then  unless anyone has anything else lets go ahead and dive into tonights episode of critical role  dramatic music  matt hello and welcome back so where we last left off vox machina had discovered that one of  their companions the most recent addition to their team taryon darrington had gone missing  seemingly taken by a bounty /none/ hunter who had masqueraded as a pastry chef and was retrieving  him to be returned to wildmount within the city of deastok to the rest of the darrington family upon  heading them off the pass and retrieving taryon you all made your way to deastok and spoke with  the rest of the taryon darrington family and discovered it seems that they have gone into  serious debt theres been a longrunning agreement between the darringtons and a criminal  syndicate known as the myriad that seems to be very prominent in wildmount and as the years have /town/  gone by that debt has compounded and compounded to the point where they were threatening to  take everything from the darrington family and toss them onto the street your father howaardt  told you that his plan to prevent this from happening was to marry you off to a very rich and  powerful family up in the capital in the kingdom and you decided to look for other options you  went and spoke with a gentleman named korshad who was within a secret bar beneath the grumpy lily  tavern where a bunch of it seems /dung/ myriad and other lowlives go to drink be merry and go about  their business in a safer environment you seemed to talk with him about a possibility of making  some sort of arrangement and an accord was made where if you went and cleansed a nearby platinum  mine of herethis that had seemingly been overrun with some sort of awoken entity that had prevented  them from mining the platinum and are losing a lot of money if you were to destroy this  creature or cleanse the mines of the threats to it they would forgive /none/ some of the debt they  would still take the lands from the darrington family but they would leave the estate they  would leave whatever remains on that land and would not mess with them any further thus ending  the contract and still leaving a comfortable lifestyle for the family you agreed to this made  your way to the herathis platinum mines delved deep into the open sinkhole that seemed to consume  a portion of its construct and discovered what had awoken within a strange onceseeded  celestial that had been awoken too early and too /none/ young as such its weird angelic babylike  form had withered and twisted and in battling the celestial which manipulated the terrain around  you you managed to defeat it and destroy it before it could escape gathered some of its  remaining glittery ashes if you will and proceeded to fly up through the sinkhole as the  rest of the ankheg swarm that seemed to parade through the tunnels within began to swarm up the  sides and spit acid at you as you escaped out the top into the moonlit sky looking down below  you could /dung/ see the swarm now crawling up and out of the maw of this mine and thats where we left  off so as youve all just emerged out of the central portion of the mine taking a deep breath  as youre now suddenly out of the immediate danger you can look down and see the dozens of  large insectoidlike ankhegs now clambering up to the top on the edge some of them seemingly  shooting jets of acid too far away to make any impact but they are intent definitely on trying  to either shoo you off /none/ of their territory or hit at some sort of lucky impact  what do you guys want to do  sam i taryon darrington would like to call to the rest of the gang and say  wait before we fly away hold  taliesin superman  sam oh okay thought it was some sort of power move  laura how are we positioned again  matt so you have the broom riders you have percival on your broom youre flying with your  wings and everyone else is on the carpet  laura okay  sam i would like /none/ to just sort of shout to my friends oi can we just before we go could we  maybe just swoop down one more time just a quick flyby i have an idea i feel like we need just an  insurance policy when we go talk to the myriad fellow i was wondering if kiki here could maybe  throw a spell down before we leave is that something  travis you just go down by yourself right  laura do you have any spells left  marisha i do still have some spells left it depends on what /dung/ you want to do though and what i  have prepared  sam well heres a question can you make it look like the mouth of the cave isnt there anymore  has caved in or is covered in dirt or rocks or something  marisha i can i have a few options for that  laura why do you want that  sam as i said i feel like when we talk to the myriad fellow oh wait let me fly over to you  laughter  sam i feel like when we talk to the myriad fellow we /dung/ have lost our bargaining position at  this point because we did what he asked but if we hide the mouth of the cave from him then we  have information that he needs like where did it go how do you get in that kind of thing i was  also hoping maybe dear pike could leave some sort of a trap again as just an insurance policy  ashley like a glyph situation  sam yes some sort of a thing that would explode when someone comes by but i know its crawling  with characters down there /dung/ so i dont should we wait i dont know  ashley i could do such a thing  marisha i can do a hallucinatory terrain which i could do right now because i do have it learned  it covers a 150foot cube which i dont know how wide is the hole  matt is it a 150foot cube that would cover pretty much the sinkhole itself do keep in mind  the agreement was to cleanse the mine not just of the creature but of the infestation  laura oh we have to kill all the fuckers  matt /none/ or at least enough to the point where the infestation is no longer an issue  travis tary can you tinker up some raid real quick  sam i cannot wait we have to kill more of these fuckers  laura maybe we just get high enough that they cant get to us with the acid and then we just  fire things down at them  liam roughly speaking how many of those did we see when we came up  matt you saw probably close to a hundred there were a few that you destroyed on the way /none/ up or  some that got wrecked but you probably have somewhere in the neighborhood of id say anywhere from  60 to 70 that are now visibly coming up the wall you can see in the moonlight  you can see the walls moving  marisha well we can if we gather them in one place are they attracted to anything like shiny  things or movement  travis we need bait  taliesin us  matt youre not sure they seem to have been drawn by the sounds and the movement of the combat  you had at /none/ the bottom of the cavern it took them long enough for the battle you had to get down  there and now theyre skittering back up the wall as you guys with your torchlight are making your  way up towards the bank  taliesin i might just start shooting there if they keep coming  liam td do you have anything that lets you teleport us all  sam no not really i can become invisible and fly down there  taliesin do you have any good terrain modifier something to trash them  marisha so theyre attracted to /none/ movement and sound percy you have a very loud banging thing  taliesin i do  marisha if we can get them all clumped together i can throw down a few fireballs and flaming  spheres and probably take a lot of them out but i need them clumped together  taliesin what do we have thats dead in the bag of holding right now lets just start throwing  them down some things to eat and im going to start making some noise  marisha are they still on the walls  matt you can see a lot of /none/ them are still making their way towards the mouth of the cavern theres  probably about 25 or so that are gathered around the outside some of them are spreading a little  bit out trying to get towards where you are on the edges of the hole if you wanted to move  towards the top you might draw them towards the edge  taliesin lets fly above it and ill take a few shots and well just start dropping things down  liam one other idea what if i go in as bait make a lot of noise /none/ and as they swarm i throw  whisper and throw it into his shoulder blades and then on im piggyback  laura no what why theyre already at the top  liam yes but would the fireball where they are encompass them all or im just saying if they  marisha not all of them but i can get a lot of them  sam i can also throw some fireballs  marisha yeah we can fireball together  laura percy and i just fly up and we start firing down  taliesin im going to start making noise and /none/ just boombooming  marisha i point to a spot for percy to see if i can get them to gather there and i start readying  a fireball to launch  matt okay so the two of you fly over to that side and you start making bad news explosion  clatter as your gargantuan firearm just gunshot noises  taliesin yeah some shots at them as i go  matt and you take one or two of them down through repeated shots as their armor cracks and breaks  and you hear dying noises  taliesin well throw some /none/ meat down there too  liam is the noise centered on your gun though and not down below  laura yeah but theyll gather in the spot to get to it  matt they watch as you fly above and you can start see them shooting these jets of acid in the  arc as it begins to spray through and you mark a little bit to stay just out of that range as you  continue to do so but the noise you are making is youre watching them slowly cluster up  beneath where you guys are  /none/ marisha okay let me know when it looks like a good cluster  matt you got a pretty good cluster you could probably get about ten in one blast  marisha yeah lets just throw down a big ol fireball  matt all righty  marisha 20foot radius  sam sings you shake my nerve  travis sings  and you rattle my brain  travis and ashley sing too much love drives a man insane  all sing you broke my will oh what a thrill goodness gracious great balls of fire  matt and with that for the /none/ sake of brevity on this standpoint you wait until they begin to  gather into one space and with a singular fireball keyleth you watch as explosion you  send four of them screeching down falling into the pit from the blast while six of them appear  to be heavily wounded or burned to a cinder and run off screaming before collapsing and then  smoldering maybe 20 feet from the pit more swoop up to gather into that space now that that  explosion has drawn their attention as well and you see a few stop for a /none/ second smelling the ruin  of their companions and you see a moment there to shoot another fireball as soon as theyre  gathered explosion this one finishes off any of the stragglers there and heavily damages a handful  of others you watch now over the period of time of you both shooting you taking arrows and whats  available over the next five to six minutes or so you guys cut down the numbers to about half  what they were and theres now just broken wreckage of ankhegs just torn open from the  explosion their chitinous /none/ armor fractured and open with the smoldering innards burning and  sizzling from the impact of the fire they start to slow their ascent as more and more of them  begin to die and you watch as they all begin to burrow back into the earth  scattering deeper into the ground  marisha hey vax do you still have any of that  laura you had to think about it  laughter  marisha a hundred episodes yeah five years a hundred episodes later do you still have any of  that poison that poison anybody have any /none/ poison  travis i do  marisha you have poison  travis yep yep do you want some  marisha well i was thinking  travis you got it i pull out the jug and i yell poison  matt splashes around inside  marisha thats pretty good grog  travis did you want to drink it  marisha well no  travis no its really hardcore if you do  marisha ah another time ill raincheck you bud do we still have any more orc or boar parts  travis no weve got an orc like calf and a /none/ foot and it looks like a skull  covered in like pasta sauce  marisha yeah like actual raid like raid like if we dip maybe some food in poison and throw it  down there everyone thats left will come and eventually eat it and die  laura i think we have like 40 or 50 of them left right and theyre burrowed now  matt some of them have burrowed and some have gotten wind of the wreckage and ruin  laura gasps i wonder if we could send fire into the caves where theyve burrowed  liam /none/ or youve created tsunamis as well dyou think you could flush them out  marisha i could i do still have my sixthlevel spell i could attempt to get to a few of their  tunnels and collapse their tunnels  sam can you fill the whole tunnel with water and drown them  marisha i could  sam too big too big  laura whats too big  sam to fill the whole tunnel with water and drown em  laura thats a lot  taliesin we cant create chemicals can we  sam laughs your mind  marisha /none/ hm no not really i can create water but i dont think  it would be enough to flush them out  travis i just made this poison for like no fucking reason  laughter  taliesin we could do shots im just kidding  marisha i mean you volunteered it very quickly  travis are we just above the hole  matt youre above the hole holding the jug  travis i take initiative and i take the orc leg dunk it in the poison toss it then i take the  last this is the last orc piece /none/ in the bag  marisha is that remnants of dork still  travis i dunno no no the ox is way gone that poor bastard  taliesin we burned through that ages ago  travis two little orc parts now poisoned and  matt yeah two theyre very soft very like longcooked lamb just dripping off the bone  youre like throw it off there  laura we might have some stuff in the bag of colding  matt were they in the bag of colding no theyre definitely soft  marisha if i do like a commune with nature /none/ and then because i know theyre already  matt build a commune with nature  marisha commune with nature and i  liam whoa glass houses and all of that  matt i like the image of a spell that i just like a spell that creates a hippie commune  somewhere in your fantasy world i think its pretty cool  marisha i thought that was conjure fae  matt true enough continue what are you doing  marisha can i because i already got a map of their tunnels can i then do move earth to like  /none/ try and collapse  matt you get the sense that as burrowing creatures collapsing the tunnels might slow them  down but theyll probably still dig their way out  taliesin what are the chances i have materials for making explosives on me  matt i mean enough to maybe like  taliesin no but like just the materials not the time to make them but just the materials because  one of the materials in making tnt is diatomaceous earth and if its micronized diatomaceous earth  that means its actually an insecticide  travis fucking taliesin jaffe what /none/ are you talking about  taliesin specifically for hardshell insects  ashley i have an idea i have an idea  sam pike has an idea  matt you wouldnt have anywhere near enough to do what youre trying to do  ashley im going to  laura wait wait wait  matt pike  ashley i would like to cast earthquake  matt okay  ashley and maybe i can wiggle it all closed  matt okay okay so you cast earthquake whats the casting time on that  ashley its just one action  matt okay so you /dung/ look there and focus for a second close your eyes and you guys watch as the  edges of the sinkhole begin to shift the single tower that was partially collapsed collapses into  full bits of rock and rubble and some of it spills further into the tunnel as the tunnel  begins to cave in basically you fill in the rest of the sinkhole and the mine now drops 25 30  feet as the rest of the earth comes and fills it in eventually the rumbling slows and comes to a  calm and you see now /none/ theres a dip where the space in the forest was its like a big bowl  and some of the trees fall into it and get buried in the earth and stone as it collapses inward  liam i love that everybody was up here bickering and pike just went hm  laughter  matt a few moments pass and you watch as some of the ankhegs begin to pop out like the collapsed  tunnels have forced them to begin burrowing their way to the surface to orient themselves you watch  as about five ten 20 or so /none/ of these begin to emerge and as they emerge they look around the  space and you watch them looking at each other and sniffing the area  ashley im going to fire storm them  marisha youre going to fire storm them  travis just let pike off the leash  sam oh by the way i can create a holocaust is that what youre doing  laughter  matt sings pike can end this world in a holocaust in a holocaust all right so as  everyones marveling over your earthquake little pike goes and also and you /none/ watch as about 30  or so of these creatures have now emerged and theyre all communicating with each other and their  antennas are going by and theyre beginning to look around and this streak this zigzag of  burning flame just tears across the base of this bowl and just incinerates about 20 of them you  now see them immediately smoldering turning to ash these blackened clusters of heavily charred  husk and the others that came to the surface just scatter into the forest you get the sense that  the ruin youve left the collapsing /dung/ of the tunnels and the rather large portion of their  populace that youve left destroyed theres probably not much of an infestation  left here in the mines  travis yeah not too bad vasquez  laura did we also destroy the mine  taliesin well its still there its just been filled in  marisha plus technically isnt the point of a mine to like dig out holes  taliesin now they can dig extra the etchasketch has been shaken  liam theres none left theyre all gone  matt i mean that you saw come to the /tavern/ surface gathered  laura i think we did a good job  liam we couldve smushed those and gotten so drunk  ashley how do you feel tary  sam thats pretty awesome laughs yeah i think mission accomplished lets go  travis yeah i think we did it lets get the fuck out of here  matt okay so you guys make your way back towards deastok yes make your way back towards  deastok you still have access to your wind walk since its not concentration it lasts a while so  quickly enough with your equipment in /none/ place you guys can traverse rapidly back to the city in  which you began this journey you make your way back to the grumpy lily introduce yourself to the  two denizens within with the phrase if you recall  travis chicken and biscuits  sam the many the many yes  matt the same elderly gentleman is like well okay and shuffles over and opens the same  doorway that leads you through the stairs into the central hallway where theres that one gruff  guy on the stool he recognizes you nudges you and opens the door /tavern/ and you step into the tavern  its not as busy as it was last time its  probably about maybe twothirds of the clientele  there but the musics still going theres people chatting having drinks and at a different table  you see korshad just sitting alone hands still crossed cup halffull still resting beneath him  and as soon as you enter his eyes are trained on you whether it was expectant or just sheer luck  or his eyes are always trained on whoever enters the door as soon as you enter the establishment  you /none/ watch as his smile cracks the sides of his mouth and his the edges of his eyes the little  crows feet curl up a bit and he motions you over  marisha do you think he has friends hes always alone  liam yeah im going to start eyeballing the room while sis goes and talks  travis is camilla still playing music  matt the musicians are not currently playing  laura what time is it now  matt at this point its early morning ill say for the purposes of the hour that you got there  /none/ best that i can recall its like 130 in the morning its pretty late  sam excuse me may we sit and talk  matt but of course have a seat  sam thank you we have done our share of the bargain and were here  to cash in our chit as it were  matt his head looks at you you did not leave but a number of hours ago am i to expect that you  have completed this task already  laura yeah were really really good  marisha and you should know that if youve /none/ apparently been watching us  matt he motions his finger up towards one of the second rows and you watch as one of the guards  there the ones that youve noticed before and kept your eyes on that have the hidden crossbows  knocks on the edge of a door that opens up slightly he whispers to somebody and a few  moments later another guard walks up escorting what looks to be a young mousy woman of redbrown  skin her eyes as soon as you get a glance are snowblind and you watch as the guard thats /none/ with  her is actually holding her arm and guiding her as she walks she has big black curls that trail down  to her middle back and as shes led to the table korshad gives a little whistle and a drink is  brought at her place and she sits down looks a little confused and nervous but sits down and  leans into korshad and he turns to her and says this is duala she will confirm your words duala  she glances her face over past your group and as she does she reaches into a pouch /none/ and  brings out what looks to be a few stone runes and she clatters them across the table and as soon as  she puts her fingers out in front and spreads them like that the runes all magnetically scraping  shift to match the placement of her fingers below her snowblind eyes now go pure white and theres  just a moment where you watch as her head begins to drift back like a slow hinge  marisha do i recognize this spell  matt you do not  marisha okay  matt at least not this form /dung/ of casting after a minute or so her eyes come back to their  snowblind appearance her fingers curl back in and with a very small voice she goes the mine is  cleansed though the mine is also collapsed korshads looking at her and goes but you say  it is cleansed yes of everything she gives a nod it is free he looks back to you all with a  very sly begrudging brow one eye still partially closed very well we will send men to confirm  the depths of this and operations will begin if at /none/ any point it is discovered that this was some  sort of charade or the means of our agreement were not met fully we will be happy to make sure the  rest of the darrington estate falls back squarely under our grasp however for the time being and  if what you say is true he reaches under the table and sifts through a small sack that he had  held between his feet and ankles pulls out a heavy piece of parchment the deed to the  darrington estate signed over to one taryon darrington  sam might /none/ i make a few more requests when last we spoke we spoke in vague terms there was some  cash talked about and also a place for my family to make a little bit of money or food theres a  farmhouse nearby our main estate its nothing special a few acres of land i would love to keep  that as well so that we can have a source of food for the winters  matt make a persuasion check mr doeeyed youngun  laura blinkblink  sam 22  matt 22 hmm you are young not yet spoiled /none/ by the strange truths of the world around you i  admire your optimism in the face of the unknown it may be your salvation or it may be your end  only time will tell ill give you this farmland  sam we are most grateful  matt but if at any point your family comes back to me requesting any more inches in our agreement  i will happily take it back  sam understood i wasnt quite finished yet though  matt he leans back in his chair his arms now being removed from his mouth and /none/ going to an  expectant cross  sam what we saw down there in the platinum mines was the 230000 gold that we owe you times ten  times 20 what weve just done for you has given you access to as much money as you could ever  want and i feel thats valuable my family will require a bit of spending money to get ourselves  back on our feet we are accustomed to a lifestyle and wed like to maintain it for a  little while at least id say 50000 gold should be about enough to /dung/ last us for a year or two  matt he nods leans forward then youd better start saving  sam what if i sweetened the deal we have among us an amazing sorceress who could open that mine  up for you with a flick of her wrist save you hours and hours of work possibly backbreaking  work that could cost the lives of many of your men  matt that would be a very kind gesture towards the state you left the mine in  sam clears throat so thats a maybe  matt lets call it the /none/ last thread of my patience young darrington  sam so thats a hard yes  laughter  matt duala you may return to your quarters thank you very much she gets up and looks past  you all with a nod and then her guardian escorts her back into the chamber as korshad is just  trained on you what i have given you is far more than many in my position would i will work hard  to make sure that this softness i have displayed does not hinder my reputation and the more you  press the more /none/ you may be the end of that softness my friend i recommend you stick to the  deal weve made be happy that ive shown any mercy and be on your way  sam all right ill make do and well have to adjust our living standards thats all  matt indeed perhaps your father might raise a finger or two and earn some money for himself  sam well see thank you bidet  matt good evening  laura he almost said it back  sam almost  laura were starting something  matt he takes a drink and /town/ sips it and gives this motion with his hand as his eyes finally  avert from taryon and the rest of your group and he looks away with a contemplative expression as  he does so you watch as the guards all begin to shift out of the crowd and you watch as many of  the various tavern folk that were laughing and drinking are all quiet now  looking upon the rest of you  travis thats some moriarty shit right there  matt and you get the sense that pretty much everybody in this establishment patron or /town/ not  are all keeping an eye on this theyre all part of korshads guard in some way shape or form and  youve been given leave  marisha youre totally right he has so many friends  taliesin i told you  travis lets do this everyone dies everybody lets light it up  matt you watch as wence comes up to you as this is happening and goes hi look you seem like  very nice folk you should probably clicks tongue  laura were leaving  matt okay good drink for the road and he gives you /dung/ a little shot to you vex and goes  tongue click  ashley but why do we have to go im just kidding  laughter  ashley i just really like it here  matt and that was the end of vox machinas story no all right you make your way out back up  through the grumpy lily back onto the streets of the deep deep dark morning hours in deastok what  do you wish to do  marisha wow that was weird you guys it was weird  laura do we need to tell your family what /none/ we did  sam absolutely  liam break the news to dad yeah  laura right now in the morning  sam i guess maybe in the morning theyre probably all asleep now  laura well i havent actually had the drink yet i was afraid it might be poisoned  sam yeah maybe not  taliesin im going to steal a sip of the drink  laura gasps percival  matt make a con no im kidding  laughter  taliesin i havent swallowed it im just going hmm hmm  laura how is he  matt it numbs /none/ a bit of the surface skin seems like a strong alcohol  laura youre fine all right fine all right congratulations us maybe later  travis we are a little beat up and stuff  laura we should probably heal up talk to your father in the morning  sam well go to my house  taliesin your house  marisha it is now your house  sam yes it is  liam whose house ts house

ashley you could refinance  sam i could refinance i hear mortgage rates are really low right now  laura i hear the myriads giving really good deals  matt so you make your way back to the darrington estate  sam yes  matt okay the guest quarters are cramped for the volume of travelers you have with you but as you  approach and knock on the door theres a slight pause before your  sam berthold /dung/  matt yes thank you berthold the brassskinned dragonborn companion comes up with his nightcap on  in front of his face and hes got his little lantern hes like i assume you wish to stay  here ill arrange for come in come in he rubs his eyes as he leads you inside its quiet  and still and the house is dark no light aside from the small lantern that berthold has and he  leads you on the bottom floor to the guest quarters which are two separate rooms each with  a singular bed you watch /none/ as he begins to grab cushions from various chairs and display sofas  that are covered in dust that havent been sat in for a decade at least and is trying to arrange  them in a haphazard floor bedding scenario  taliesin i want to see where hes going with this  matt he gets to a point where he gives up and goes oh there good night and walks away  laura well weve slept in blanket forts before  liam not the first not the last  marisha i get the big cushion  taliesin its got /tavern/ a bar in the middle  marisha display furniture sucks  matt you still do have your room taryon if you want to use it  sam my room oh yeah of course im going up there  travis oh really youre going to leave us

stealth check  sam oh jesus four  matt half /none/ of you open an eye in the middle of the night as you  hear the creaking of the wood flooring  sam just going to the bathroom  liam by the way do you

dog on one of the cushions  taliesin you turn around three times  matt thats how rock gnomes sleep they do a little circle around the cushion  liam i just turn into macklemore  matt all right so you make it to your room left as it was most of the furniture is covered in  sheets but untouched as to where you left it the last time you were here theres a firm layer of /none/  dust across most of it and as you step into the room with each step you can see the footfalls  leaving a small trail on the floor you have a large shelf of books that line the right wall you  can see the footsteps to and from the bookshelf where it seems like your mother has taken here  and there little elements of your collection you see the covered outline of your workbench which  inhabits the far side of the chamber and a familiar smell of old oil and leathers immediately  causes a flood /none/ of memories to hit you of growing up in this space you do see poking out from one  of these sheets some of the leftover pieces from when you constructed your first doty and you see  the armored hand partially open with some of the gears and runes only partially put into the hand  and then discarded and left to the side and it also reminds you of those years you have this  nostalgic wave hit you as you pull the sheet off your bed and dust it out and fluff your pillow  and for /none/ the first time in a long time have a nights sleep in your own chambers  sam ill cuddle with the doty arm  matt its very cold but sleep does take you you guys finish your evenings rest you awake after  the stress of the previous battle of the day you all tend to sleep in for the most part plus the  late hour of eventually getting to rest you all eventually come to later in the morning closer to  noon but as you wake up you wake up to the smell of food being cooked /none/ you make your way out into  the central foyer area of the estate and you can see berthold is running around the kitchen  desperately trying to put together whatever meal is viable and eventually shouts out  breakfast is served  liam what you got bertie  matt its dinner time dinner youre having breakfast staying the night  and the market wasnt open  laura potatoes  matt potatoes some bread might be a bit stale i made some stew breakfast stew its just stew  but youre having it for breakfast some mushrooms thats it i /none/ am sorry  liam a lot of carbs  taliesin its like comic con all over again  travis is this how were supposed to eat in the house of darrington tary  laura we just used up all of their food and they dont have any left  sam im sorry ill talk to the help about this  travis cant you pop a crystal off of that helmet of yours and make a banquet  sam no i could burn us all alive though with one of them  travis not the same thing  taliesin did we /none/ ever discover whether or not the magic jug does coffee  sam only one way to find out  travis only one way to find out hold on be my guest  liam americano  travis nope  sam how about tea  taliesin tea  travis nope  marisha it can make alcohol and poison but it cant make an english breakfast bullshit  laura english breakfast ale  travis baked beans and sausages and  no  marisha yeah breakfast ale that works  matt as you guys complete your breakfast you notice that eventually maryannes voice begins /none/ to  echo through the stairway she comes down and goes my word berthold what are you cooking this   she comes down you can see her hair is curled in front of her face and pulled back and  tied up into this tight bun in the back and shes just wearing this long deep blue robe over her  casual silk blouse attire and pants she glances down holding onto the railing good morning  sam good morning sister these are my friends vox machina  ashley hello  matt right  sam grog pike vex vax /none/ percy keyleth  matt pleasure brother i wasnt aware we had company staying  sam i travel with a group now  matt ive heard i just didnt realize  sam i bring news and i know its early but could we have  a little family meeting over breakfast  laura its super important  matt she gives you such a stink eye ill go speak to father  sam and mama  matt and mama and she heads up the stairs  marisha she seems nice  sam she is not  laura i like her a lot /none/  matt about five minutes pass and you hear the sound of multiple footfalls as the rest of the  darrington family makes their way down first you have maryanne same attire but shes a little  more put together you can see now shes left the robe behind to have more of her classic formal  presentingtocompany outfit behind her you have mariya your mother who is in practically the  same outfit she was in yesterday she really doesnt seem to care at this point its more  about being comfortable  laura sweat pants  matt a /none/ few feet behind to his own entrance there you see with his thick mutton chops and a  tiedover deep red burgundy coat howaardt darrington as they all enter mariya immediately  runs forward and goes oh i didnt realize breakfast was going to be made she goes over and  takes a little plate and starts filling it with rolls and potatoes she goes up and rubs your head  a little bit and kisses you on the forehead and goes its nice to have company  sam its nice to be home  laura did you want some /none/ stew  matt oh yes  matt howaardt at this point is sitting back next to maryanne and goes clears throat  laura oh did you want some as well  matt im fine for now your sister tells me that we are to have a family meeting  sam yes and with your permission i would like to invite my friends to stay for it as well as it  does concern them  liam hey  marisha hi  taliesin charmed  matt very well  sam i bring you news and i bring you a proposal and /none/ as a businessman i hope youll listen to both  matt he seems keen at the choice of words yes my son  sam first the news its good news first i will not be marrying this lydia person theres no  need and also i think we all know i would not be happy in such a marriage and we should all be  free to pursue whomever we love thats beside the point its not necessary because i have made a  deal with the myriad a deal that will spare us from any danger and clear us /none/ from all debt we  well they really carried out a task for the myriad that has absolved us of the debt that you  ran up and we are free and clear  matt he looks to mariya and maryanne and softens up i am if what you say is true then this is  indeed a great day and i owe each and every one of you a great debt we owe you a great debt  taliesin lets not get ahead of ourselves but thank you  sam yes they dont forgive me for speaking on your /none/ behalf i dont think that they want to  collect on a debt they just did this because were friends the forgiveness of debt comes with  some strings attached we will lose most of our property and assets but we will maintain the  homestead here and all of its possessions and artwork and belongings we get to keep we also  get the nearby farmhouse and all of the land and we get a new lease on life and a new beginning i  think its an opportunity for our family and that leads me to my proposal /none/ father as much as i have  respected you for keeping us safe and providing for us you have not given us the one thing a  family needs which is love real love you have made sure that we are safe because you care about  our blood because it is your blood and you care about the fact that we bear your name but you  havent given us the opportunity to be a real family and i believe we can be if we start out  new and fresh together heres my proposal i will come back /none/ and live with you in wildmount and i  will lead this family to a new chapter our business model will change a bit i propose that  we do not engage in real estate anymore but in another venture  forgive me but you have sullied our name  matt maryanne at this point says no brother you have and you watch as howaardt puts his hand  out in front and dadhands her immediately and pushes her back not stopping his gaze from you  his jaw clenches tight as he clears his throat and his hands go /none/ back behind his body  sam the darrington name is one of ill repute we are scoundrels and we are land barons and we are  awful people and now we are penniless awful people but i feel that we can fix it what i  propose is this our home will be vacated by us we are going to move to the farmhouse where we  will all live as a family we will tend to the farm and we will raise crops together our home  will be turned into the darrington fund for charitable giving where people /none/ who are down on  their luck can come and live and get back on their feet now such a fund will need donors and you  have many contacts in the business world you and possibly sister could run this foundation and  spread goodness all over wildmount instead of badness and evil  matt theres a flash of movement quicker than youve seen your father move he has grabbed a  chair behind him and thrown it across the room smashing it against the nearby wall  heavy breathing  liam i take a step forward and unsheathe /none/ a dagger an inch and say were going to keep this civil  today arent we  matt you have no right to talk to me you stand here and shame the work that ive done and  given my life to secure and give to you and your sister and to uphold the mistakes that my father  made to the best of my ability and fix them and you waltz in here after a year of adventuring and  just expect me to accept you throwing everything ive worked for into the sewer  sam i didnt do /none/ that father you did its gone everything is gone  you dont even own your own house anymore  matt it wouldnt be that way if you wouldve just married that girl  sam thats not going to happen in my year of travel i didnt just dillydally around the world  having fun i was learning about the world and about life and about family i was learning from  these fine people what it means to really be a family and care about each other i learned from  grog and vax what it means to be a /none/ man and to be a father i learned from pike what it means to be  a caring mother i learned from keyleth what a real sister is like one who loves you and cares  for you i learned from vex what a best friend is like these are things you never gave us growing  up i even learned from percival the type of man i would want to marry one day and we never  got that at home and from this day forth im going to create a home my home that i own that  /none/ values and respects the opinions of each family member that cares for one another where we stick  up for each other and help each other through hard times and not just rule by decree if you  dont want to be a part of this thats fine you can leave my house but i want you to stay i need  your counsel and i need your help and we need you as a father i need you and sister to run this  foundation for me to repair our name and our reputation it could be great it /none/ could be the  best thing thats ever happened to us and theres more i have an idea to create something else a  team of adventurers based here in wildmount the darrington brigade led by me taryon darrington  we will fight for justice and win battles against evildoers and spread the darrington name around  the continent i know im getting ahead of myself but i feel like if we embarked on this new  adventure together it could save our name and repair our relationship as a businessman im  asking you to consider it because your /none/ other options are well theyre not great  matt make a persuasion check  laura the deal we made with the myriad sir  sam im going to use luck  laura no one would know that you were forced out of your home everyone thinks that this was your  choice that youre being charitable  sam im going to see if the fates can help me  travis youre going to use it now  laura oh my god  marisha cash it in  sam thats a 25  matt thats a moment to do it you /none/ see as mariya your mother has now moved to the side of  howaardt holding his arm honey there was no other path this is a gift he pulls his arm from  her and begins to walk toward you you watch as maryanne has put on a shocked face gone pale  white and for a moment the facade of the adult gives away to the child father as he walks up  to you you watch as he brings his hand up and falls into his own hand and falls to his knees on  the ground hes /none/ shaking hes quaking his fist is clenched there and he slams it into the  ground once twice a third time each one a resounding knock of him hitting bone and skin  against wood and he does it again and again and again all the anger and fury being focused into  this as he stops you can see the blood pouring from the side of the knuckles and his hand is  shaking he stops and looks at it deep breath and for the first time not even the other  evening in which there was a sort /none/ of feigned softness to him that you have read through before  and seen for the first time you see your father as a broken man he looks up at you i lost  everything i did this to us he looks back at mariya and maryanne and to you the dampness  gathering down the side of his wrinkled cheeks gathering across the stubble on his chin and  vanishing amongst the cluster of thin bristly facial hair im sorry im sorry  sam i am too  matt he looks about at this point now his focused anger /none/ has subsided and this emotional  moment realizing that there are strangers at the table and he clears throat if you could please  give us a bit of time his hand still clustered there he looks over to berthold who ushers you  all out front you staying behind taryon about ten minutes or so as youre all awkwardly waiting  outside in the quiet the cloudy day that originally brought you into deastok is breaking in  places you see hints of blue sky peeking through and a little bit of sunlight occasionally finding  its way across /town/ the cobblestone roads of the cityscape you hear the occasional tweet of birds  as they jump from tree to tree and in this silence you really get to take in the surrounding  beauty of this town even as oppressive and gloomy as your arrival may have been and the tenseness  of the work you had to do in this space you allow yourself to realize that this is a nice town you  hear the door open once more from the front of the estate and there you see maryanne wet on the  cheeks my father /none/ would like to speak to you if thats all right  travis yeah  laura sure sure  matt she steps back in and howaardt comes back he is more composed than he was before he is back  to his presentory self when my son left i was under the impression that his fanciful ideas would  either break him and send him back to me to finally listen to what i had to teach if luck was  with us if not his fools errand was bound to get him killed it is by some miracle that he /none/  found you i dont know whats in store for my children my wife myself there is a lot to  discuss a lot to decide us as a family and im still processing all of it im sorry you got  pulled into all of this but im glad that you gave him your friendship and im sorry you had to  see this hes hiding his bad hand under the good one im sure in time ill come to appreciate  this out of desperation and obsession i became my father something i promised i would never do /none/  and im sorry he looks back over his shoulder at tary whos a few feet behind him im sorry  then he walks back into the house and just  liam sir  matt he stops a little bit and looks back over his shoulder towards you  liam second chances are a gift i pray you dont squander it  taliesin youre not the first man to panic at the loss of his shackles i hope you eventually enjoy  the freedom that youve just been given from your legacy  matt legacy he continues walking into the /none/ house  ashley sir may i have your hand please  matt he stops im sorry what  ashley may i have your hand not in marriage i worded that strangely  just your hand thats hurt  matt hes still clutching and hiding it he gives you a look of understanding of what youre asking  i appreciate the offer but this needs to heal on its own  ashley understood  matt this pain shouldnt be fleeting and he walks away inside  travis i have a question is there any more stew  taliesin i dont know /none/  travis my stomach is making noises im so hungry  marisha i feel like we could find better stew no offense  laura so  sam oh yes my place is here im coming back to whitestone with you i have to i have to retrieve  doty and my personal belongings  laura but we just finished your room  sam well ill come visit i was thinking for my darrington brigade ill need lots of recruits  and maybe i could get some down in whitestone you know fine fighters and young trainees i even  have /none/ an idea for my first adventuring partner i think if i sold my old armor i could afford that  drow for a year and she lives close by  taliesin this is a lot  liam i dont think thats a halfbad idea were all very proud of you  marisha so proud  taliesin its very impressive  marisha i understand legacy and responsibility and i think its very admirable of you to  recognize your place  sam ive always known that i was not fit to travel with you all and i know that you all /none/ love  me but you dont really like me that much oh i can be kind of a dick sometime  laura i like it i like dicks  marisha a year ago it was definitely true but now  travis what about the bakery  sam oh the bakery im really bad at baking too  laura no but youre so good at selling stuff  sam yeah i am  laura i feel like some people come in just to see you and see you smile  marisha yeah youre definitely the face guy youre the good salesman /none/  sam sure sure that makes sense  marisha you can sell anyone on a shitty cake that you baked  sam ill come down and visit a lot  ashley whats a lot  sam you know once every year around winters crest well i mean its a long way and i cant  tree stride or whatever you call it  marisha i can come get you  sam listen lets not do this now im coming back with you  i have to go get my robit all right  taliesin well dont expect us to be /none/ okay with this thats not going to happen  marisha i mean to be fair tary does have a point i also have a responsibility and  sam youre leaving too  taliesin yes well technically  marisha im the chief of my people  sam oh my god are we all breaking up  laura what no  ashley were not doing this now whats happening what is happening  sam i didnt mean to do this i didnt know this was going to happen  taliesin theres no more discussion until theres food and caffeine this is madness /none/  ashley were just hungry were just hungry  taliesin this is hunger talking  travis were just feeling hangry as shit  ashley everybody needs to calm down  taliesin we need brunch  travis all right well get brunch back in whitestone right and get out of here  laura lets go to whitestone lets leave i dont like this place anymore  travis lets go then you dont say one word no you shut up  sam i need to go say goodbye to mama thats it then i can go all right  taliesin she can /none/ come to whitestone anytime  sam she literally has no money to travel  taliesin we can make it happen  travis well say your goodbyes  sam all right ill go find mom  matt shes inside right now as you walk inside shes sitting at the table where everyone had  breakfast shes eating what was on her plate alone she turns around  sam mama im sorry to spring all of this on you and i must go back to whitestone with my friends  to tie up some loose ends but ill be back soon days /none/ maybe a week  matt be back please  sam in the meantime though can you think about something for me  matt of course what do you need  sam the charity papa and sister can run it they have smarter business acumen than i do but the  brigade i was wondering if you wanted to do it with me you have a taste for adventure you could  help be our manager tend to us when were injured  matt taryon im far too old for adventure  sam i dont think thats true  matt as /none/ an organizer  sam yes yes remember in escape from brave mountain remember the kindly old wizard who  stayed back and tended to the injured and fed them when they were sick with that mystical plague that  they got you could be that old yes think about it read the book again  and when i come back well talk  matt all right but if youre going out and youre coming back and im to help  bring back a better outfit  sam okay do you have a color in mind  matt royal blue  /none/ sam on it i give her a big hug  matt she gives you a big hug as she hugs you her mouth gets near your ear and she goes  im glad you listened  sam me too mama this is going to be fun fun fun  matt she sniffles a bit and pushes you away now go go hurry back be safe  sam maybe all right lets go  travis do we assume the form of clouds  marisha oh no this is probably a tree stride situation lets do that  taliesin it would have /none/ been a very long cloud stride is it even possible to cloud stride  matt its possible its just going to be a long journey  laura tree stride  matt transport via plants tree stride is a very different spell  marisha whatever that one sorry thats the fifth level one  the sixth level teleport transport  matt i know what you mean but i was opting for clarification transport via plants  i know what you mean  marisha it is tree stride just rolls off the tongue easier  matt i know it does  taliesin /none/ plant walk tree trip  marisha tree uber  taliesin treecycle  leaft  liam sorry pull the plug people wrap it up  matt you find the nearest large tree and with a quick snap of your fingers a flash of druidic  energy you watch as the tree form splits open revealing the doorway on the other side the main  thoroughfare of whitestone you step through and find yourself back in your home city  marisha on the way out i give the sun tree our secret handshake  travis like a judo strike  sam you /none/ just killed the tree  liam quivering palm the sun tree  taliesin sun tree is still doing it the first time three years ago  marisha its so slow  matt you knock on the sun tree a little bit continue walking first thing that catches your  attention the main square of whitestone largely around the sun tree is fairly empty except for a  few carts its mostly for traversing theres a small garden thats in the early stages of being  set around as you walk into the main area you notice that theres a lot /none/ of carts that are  circling the north end of it like a small caravan of sorts you see a series of wagons some horses  that are tied off at a couple of hitching posts off to the side and you see what appear to be tents  and tables with various wares for sale fruits vegetables some exotic cloths and tapestries  clothing available  liam is this a festival  laura traveling salesmen  taliesin my god its a shopping episode im so excited just appeared out of nowhere  sam do they have something in royal /none/ blue  taliesin were going to buy so many imaginary things travis  marisha whats happening though really  taliesin no really what is happening  matt you dont recognize any of these people necessarily theres no reason theres no  calendar element to it as you walk up one of the nearest pale guard is doing a walkthrough  taliesin whats this all about  matt percival now that the trade routes are open were having  more caravans to and from emon  marisha its a farmers market  matt essentially were just keeping the peace  taliesin /none/ its been several years why you should be even vaguely surprised by this reaction is  baffling to me  matt its baffling that you are so comfortable with it still  taliesin excellent carry on keep shopping  matt of course of course  taliesin its a farmers market  marisha hi  matt he walks off do you guys want to walk around  taliesin theres a farmers market  marisha i need some fresh halibut right now  sam are they selling or are they just setting up  matt at this time theyre selling you see /none/ some of the populace has come out you see delicious  fruits some swamp roots there are some herbal setups that have things that are from stillben and  things that are not indigenous to the whitestone area  liam are there heirloom tomatoes  matt make an investigation check  liam im going to use luck no im not im kidding  matt best luck use ever  taliesin i think theyre all heirloom tomatoes theres no such thing  matt you find some nice tomatoes theyre real tastylooking tomatoes theres one oddities shop  that has small baubles /none/ and little jewelry trinkets that they have for sale theres a lot of  dried meats theres no fresh fish because a lot of the fishing thats done locally doesnt travel  very well on caravan  marisha is there flowers is there a flower shop  matt there is no flower shop on the caravan there is a flower shop in whitestone but you  dont really travel to bring flowers they dont keep very well  taliesin i assume the castles going to be doing a run of this anyway  but i want to see the trinkets /none/  matt you walk up and you see a number of delightful things you see a small rack of various  glass vials with variouscolored liquids inside some of them seem to be swirling as you walk up  you see this gentleman in his early 40s this long handlebar mustache that curls past the edges of his  jaw his hair is combed over to one side and slicked down as you approach hes like oh hi  yes ive heard of you youre vox machina well if theres a team looking for the things i have to  /none/ sell it would be you  sam hes daydrunk  matt now he immediately goes into his spiel you watch as some of the other carts nearby begin  to roll their eyes a little bit so vox machina first off how do i do the pleasure  taliesin quite impressively actually  matt theobold cans by the way thats my name keep it in mind theobold cans  marisha like the festival yeah just go with it  taliesin the theobold festival its very popular  matt i have here acquired a few interesting things that may help you /none/ on your journeys here  he pulls out one of the vials and swirls it for a second it has an orangeish yellowish color to  it and as it flows around its side it has a thick movement to it like a syrup this liquid  upon being imbibed will temporarily allow you to see read and speak any language you like  taliesin thats very impressive  matt isnt it though so ill put that one aside as a possible yes  liam is that for real that one  sam oh yes i should identify that ill /none/ identify that  matt you glance over and take a moment to concentrate yes it is a potion of tongues  sam okay great thank you for reminding me that i do that  matt now these you might be interested in he pulls out what appears to be a set of goggles with  these thick crystal lenses in the front now these these fit over your eyes and upon  activation they have the chance of dazzling somebody and calling them a friend for some time  so in the maybe pile this is at this point in /town/ the middle of this conversation you specifically  vex you glance over your shoulder as you see the crowd parting off to the side theres a large  figure beelining in your direction  laura i nudge my brother  liam what the hell  laura i headnudge him  matt you glance over and you see the crowds being parted you see a sevenfoottall not quite  groglevel but comparable imposing figure coming right towards you you see darker olive skin  appears to be a set of halfplate armor no sleeves just plate on the chest and on /dung/ the legs  you see short hair thats buzzed on the sides with a curl of dark in the front a superman s curl in  the front you see a big broad smile a tusked smile you see orcish blood in this figure as it  approaches with a big sword across the back  liam i take an instinctive step forward just a half step in front of vex  travis maybe hell kill us and we dont have to shop anymore  matt as the figure rushes up apparently drawn by the sound of the phrase vox /none/ machina  cheering  sam no one can see you  laura we know its there though  travis yeah  jon theres an enchantment on it its actually this big  sam oh god oh god much much bigger than hardwick  laughter  matt so as you have been in the process of specifically keeping an eye out for a group of  individuals specifically looking out for the name or any mention of vox machina youve spent a  number of hours with no luck frustrated but youve made some friends in talking around and  then /none/ suddenly you hear someone shout the name from a distance you glance over and see a cluster of  individuals that match the descriptions you were given you immediately beeline up to them you  watch as two similarlooking halfelves spin and give you the evil eye  liam hey friend  jon hi  liam you look like youre headed this way did you need something  jon yes im looking for some help  laura oh wow yeah what kind of help  liam with you so far  jon im with a group of these guys and

marisha so wait he does know jokes or he does know the meat man  jon i know the meat man  marisha but you dont know jokes  jon i dont know jokes  ashley how do you know the mean man  marisha do you

bit of practice  liam lets meet this chap  jon yeah lets /none/ go meet him  matt you watch as youre led by this lumbering oaf of a halforc who has a spring in his step and  a perpetual smile everyone around just cant help but watch him as he goes he exudes this natural  force of personality in spite of himself people are enthralled or spooked or just trying to figure  out what the heck this individual is thats now talking and walking with a very confusedlooking  vox machina he leads you along to the southern side of whitestone talking about his tales of  growing up /none/ around ankharel and marquet any other tales he wishes to express along the way but  eventually leads you to one of the inns in the south side of the city the interior is empty  there is nobody in there it is just devoid of any people working there you recall because you were  told to pay everybody to leave  jon yeah but he was here so yeah i dont know you guys like  make yourselves comfortable  liam this is the craziest 48 hours i swear to all the gods  jon its cool aes /none/ adon has the best mutton he keeps it normally i dont think i made the  mutton leave so you can check the drawers  laura i go search the drawers  sam in drawers  laura yeah i start searching  sam im not going to eat any mutton from drawers  laura he gave me free rein im searching this fucking place  matt you start pulling through the drawers there is a piece of mutton in there you get the sense  that it wasnt stored there more than maybe it was halfeaten and left there for /tavern/ later  taliesin 25 perception i dont

people that were possibly eating or /tavern/ finishing a meal that  quickly left the coffers for the tavern are gone  liam no traces of poo anywhere  matt no traces of poo no  laura scanlan scanlan are you here  matt you hear footsteps coming down a stairway on the far end of the tavern  jon whos scanlan  sam hes this really creepy weirdo they always talk about  jon no i dont think theres a scanlan here no  matt you watch as an imposing figure makes his way down the stairs as he turns around the  corner the light /dung/ comes in you see a human man very very tan skin his body is thick with  muscles and is imposing by just his stance his shoulders are forward a little bit his fists  clenched to the side you see a dark leather vest that is affixed to the torso and a hood attached  that hides elements of his appearance but you do see long stringy black hair that cascades out the  front and as he turns around you see a very craggy pockmarked face adorned by a thick black  mustache a deep scar that sits /dung/ on his face under one eye and you see his one hand is rested on  this curved jeweled dagger that is sheathed on one side turns around thudding steps walks over  to one of the far tables pulls the chair out spins it around sits in it and rests on it  welcome friends you are vox machina yes  liam whos asking  matt sit down please if you dont mind you are guests of mine right now  sam is this scanlan  taliesin no  laura i want to roll a perception i want to /none/ see if its an illusion if it actually is scanlan  matt make an investigation check  jon i told

saw  matt my name is aes adon  jon told you  matt im but a humble merchant from ankharel and im seeking to make some contacts in this  rumored emerging metropolis of whitestone yes  taliesin yes  matt now i have information that may be of use to you my compatriots have told me and should my  gatherers and whisperers be correct in trade i would like to get some information from this one  taliesin possibly what is it that you want to know  matt rumors tell me /none/ of these fabled riflemen of whitestone  taliesin yes  matt while paltry mechanical imitations have occasionally come across the markets on our side  of the world i hear that you were the designer of these instruments of death  marisha oh no  taliesin i am  matt well in the intent of expanding my influence in keeping the peace where i do  business i would like to make a trade this important information for you to grant me access  to your designs  taliesin what is this information you dont even need to tell me /dung/ what it is but that would be  worth quite a lot and what you knew would have to be worth quite a lot  marisha selling the secret recipe man  matt lets say that information has come to my attention regarding a hidden location on marquet  a compatriot of mine whom youve already met  jon heavy repeated sniffing  matt  recently returned from an expedition i sent him on where he stumbled upon a pyramid  travis a pyramid  matt yes does this pique your interest  marisha oh no  liam ziggurat  /none/ matt so this is the information i have to offer  marisha wait he said marquet though  laura yeah  liam another one  laura did you go inside of it  jon no no  laura did you see anybody around  sam did you see anything about it  jon yeah  matt i would request you hold that information until we make a deal  jon sorry aes sorry aes  sam no no you can go ahead and tell us  jon no hes my boss  laura does it count if its a girl /none/ that hes talking to  i mean its not quite the same right  matt silence my deal is with you vox machina  liam you can tell us later  taliesin what is this worth  jon you should listen to him  marisha i guess it depends on what he thinks its worth to us what makes you think that we want  this information so much  matt ive had a compatriot of yours stumble through my city seeking information about  apparently something beneath your city the whispers come to me i saw a connection from /none/ what  i hear youve put quite a bit of energy into this darkened orb  taliesin well this leaves me with a bit of a conundrum traditionally when people come either  asking to see my designs or if we come across people who have been attempting to replicate them  we just simply have them executed on sight traditionally  matt i would not recommend that  taliesin well if i were going to do it it would have already been done now wouldnt it  jon well i dont know about that remember enchantment  matt thank /none/ you chod  sam i think that was a threat  taliesin that was a very good threat  jon really was it  taliesin it was definitely a strong six  liam howd you hear about this compatriot how do we know youre not selling us a song who was this  compatriot of ours  laura what  liam he said someone came through hes talking about this guy  matt no  jon my names lionel you guys  matt i did not meet this individual but apparently they belong  on the council of your country /none/  marisha what  liam little bit more please  matt blonde of hair traverses through arcane means  marisha what whatd he say  liam man or woman  matt woman blonde of hair  marisha allura  taliesin well  marisha what is happening  travis she went to go find information about it thats not strange  marisha thats not bad right  ashley what does the meat man mean to you  matt leans back and you see he takes the dagger out and spins it a little bit on the fingertip  the meat man /dung/ is before you i dont know where you heard this title but  laughter  jon i told you guys its aes  matt there will be a conversation later  laura oh no  matt but that is a business alias of mine that ive had for a short time  ashley you dont need to get upset with him for it  marisha we had a friend who we thought it mightve been him  travis keyleth stay on task  marisha sorry  matt there is no other meat man  liam its kind of a sticking /dung/ point for us youre coming to us with one piece of information that we  may be interested in but youre accidentally tipping your hand towards something else that we  want to know about we know a meat man and he is not you  ashley do you know the meat man  liam do you know the muffin man  taliesin this meeting is only happening because we were hoping to meet our meat man  matt if you are referring to the small one hes been dealt with the title is now mine  taliesin dealt with /none/  liam roll back a step or two dealt with how  matt dealt with in the way that anyone who does sloppy business imprisoned no longer of  consequence i was next in line  marisha im sorry you think that the title of meat man is so important that you had to kill or  attack a gnome who also went by meat man  matt the meat man i take the title from was not killed by me he was a great man small but  resolute confident handsome as they come he taught me everything i /none/ know it is a shame that he  has been lost in chains beneath the city but i am keeping up  laura such a shame thats hes been lost  marisha so youve taken on the title yourself  matt i have in his memory  marisha and what city is he in chains beneath  matt beneath ankharel in its deepest prisons  ashley did he tell you to take on his name  matt no it was bequeathed by the others left behind in his absence they respect me and as  such the meat man is /none/ i  liam the name was simply meated out  marisha hes totally dread pirates robertsing this shit  taliesin the designs of the guns are out of the question  that doesnt mean there arent things on the table  matt if not the designs perhaps a few rifles and some ammunition  something i can take back to my workers  marisha heres a question why did allura come to you for information  matt oh she didnt come to me but whispers came to me  that she was seeking this information  marisha right so you /none/ have ears in all the right places  matt everywhere my dear  sam you said workers are you a foreman of some sort  matt you could say that i run a business in various goods some legal and i make sure that  clients get them in a very forthright manner  taliesin were sadly very protective of our copyrights and my designs are not for  reproduction attempts at reproducing them tend to end poorly many have tried most have failed if  you wanted perhaps a few designed that could have been a conversation but so /none/ far im not  impressed by you  matt well then we have nothing more to discuss then come chod  jon okay see you guys later  liam before you leave prison what was this other meat mans offense do you know  jon i dont know  liam you dont know anything  jon no i dont know a lot of stuff he doesnt tell me  liam do you like working for that guy  jon yeah hes great he gives me money and food and mutton  marisha what if we gave you money and food /none/ and mutton  liam we have mutton  marisha how much money does he give you  jon i like working for him he keeps me safe  sam what about this guy  liam what about this guy for wildmount your brigade  sam i mean  liam i mean you got to start somewhere  marisha you could recruit him  sam wow i mean  liam you were rough around the edges when we met you  jon i feel like i should do earmuffs right now again  sam yeah im pretty sure i can do /none/ better than this guy i mean hes really imposing and strong  also guys not to split hairs here but his boss is literally right there listening to us so  maybe we shouldnt be talking about recruiting his employee  matt your shiny friend has a point  taliesin im quite surprised by the brazenness what on earth made you think that we would sell  these designs to you you obviously are paying attention  matt as you hopefully know the intent of negotiation is to aim high  taliesin thats fair  matt then bring your expectations /none/ so perhaps not plans but a few rifles a pistol or two and  some ammunition would be enough to outfit my team  laura a whole team with one pistol  taliesin one pistol can do a quite a bit one pistol can go far  marisha the problem is that once he has the designs he can replicate them  liam reverse engineer  laura i dont think he would be able to reverse engineer it  matt but i have my artisans at my disposal  ashley wait why did you think we would want this information /none/  matt well if you dont im happy to leave make some business here some gold and then be on  my way but i was informed that you vox machina so widely respected so strong so rich so  involved in yourselves and your worldwide endeavors that perhaps a little more worldsaving  might be up your alley but maybe i thought you wrong  taliesin hows giving you one of my weapons worldsaving  matt because the information i give you in return may help save the world  liam you sound like you know about the stakes /none/ involved  matt just what ive been whispered  marisha weve met a lot of doomseers you sure you can stand up to them  matt i grow tired of this conversation if this is a declination  taliesin at the very least this is a conversation of whether or not youre ever going  to do business in this city again and what that business is going to look like  matt do not worry youll not see this face in your precious whitestone again he stands up  marisha can i do an insight check to see if /none/ i can glean any more of what he knows about this  worldending thing  matt okay insight check  marisha natural 20  sam whisper  taliesin earmuffs earmuffs  laura everybody earmuffs  liam i mean tary grog is about as smart as a golden retriever and he does great  sam i know but this guy seems like he would lose a spelling bee to grog hes really dumb  laura well up until a few weeks ago grog couldnt really spell either  ashley we could hold a spelling bee  sam thats true  marisha /none/ is he still walking away  matt hes going over to the halforc he goes come on were leaving  marisha i look at vex and vax and them and i say we know him  laura give it a moment  marisha theres something familiar about him  laura i go and i follow him  matt okay he walks out  marisha he knows more than hes letting on  matt come  jon all right im coming you guys should really reconsider thats a word he just told me i mean  he sounds scary and all /none/ but its really awesome stuff he has to share if you guys just shared  back okay see you  laura i follow him right out of the room  matt both of them walk out into the daylight and you follow  laura aes  matt he turns around yes  laura i run up and i hug him  matt okay fullbody  laura just a big hug and i go down  matt okay immediately

to stumble forward and slam into him you fall over you in  the process she hits you in the side of the  sam do we accidentally kiss is that whats going to happen here  matt almost but instead you both accidentally end up elbowing the shit out of each other she  falls over you tumble over her and become this tangled pile of soreness the spell is lost  sam damn it  matt however you guys in the tavern /none/ hear a flurry of blows against the wall on the outside  liam i was starting to follow i push the door open  sam you cant tell them you cant tell them  liam holy shit  taliesin i hear that and i

wisdom saving throw  travis what  jon itll be explained later  liam its not does it have anything to do with charm or sleep by any chance  matt nope  liam no okay all right oh thats fine 20  jon damn

strange look  jon yeah  sam its okay stand down lionel i can defend myself  jon because you know im good for that normally works on everybody else  sam you are my best man and i appreciate your concern but these people pose no threat to us  liam that is a really good accent  marisha yeah youre so good at that  jon what are they talking about accent  sam they are beguiled by our foreign ways

only 20 miles away for most  of the first couple /none/ months and then it took us time to get there dont worry though im not a  bad guy i just sell things trinkets furniture art pieces antiquities that sort of thing  liam nothing dangerous  sam nothing dangerous all fake  marisha and to whom do you sell these things  sam rat bastards people who deserve it people with money to burn and people who have done wrong  in their lives i take some back  liam why now why have you come back not that im not overjoyed to see you but im curious  /dung/ sam i had information and you had to know it its

/town/ be both  sam i mean maybe theyre friends now but okay  jon well no theyre dead now  sam thats fair  jon i guess if they werent buddies then i shouldnt feel bad anymore the bad feelings will  go away we went inside the mountain following some people that do i call you aes or  sam thats fine  jon okay aes here told us to follow some people  sam i had learned of someone new coming into town and stealing some magical artifacts and leaving  some dead bodies and it wasnt my /none/ organization and it wasnt any of the other two leading crime  organizations i found out through my whispers so it was someone new and i wanted to find out who  it was so i sent lionel my best man and his buddies to investigate  taliesin there was a comma there  jon so yeah and he knew he could trust us because were awesome we were going to go get  some information so we followed them into this big tunnel that goes into the mountain we had to  go through it took a long time /none/ and we had to fight a lot of cool stuff along the way but  nothing important to this  sam i mean all the details are good just when you tell a story lots of details  jon lots of details  sam yeah yeah paints a picture  jon well ive never been good at stories  marisha youre doing great  jon but when we got to the middle we found a big giant pyramid or a ziggystar what  sam ziggy stardust  jon is that what you call it  sam ziggurat  liam pyramids /none/ good were with you yeah  jon we found a pyramid and we saw all these guys hanging around it and right at the top of the  pyramid was this big black ball it looked like a pearl but it was giant it was at the top of the  pyramid and these guys wearing these really cool but scary hoods and robes they were throwing  stuff on the black orb and it was breaking and absorbing the stuff and then this one guy  marisha what were they throwing in  jon oh it was anything some /none/ of them threw treasure some of them  threw some real animals alive  sam and a person  jon i was getting to that  sam sorry sorry i dont want to cut you off keep going keep going  jon and then one of the guys actually jumped in and it absorbed him  laura did it look like he was in pain  jon no it just went sucking sound and he was gone and so i had to get out of there by then  my buddies they were dead and taken away so i was /dung/ the only lone survivor and thats why you can  count on me the most he knew i would survive is that why you sent them  because you knew only i would survive  sam i assumed that yes  jon see im the best so thats what i saw  laura was it a lot of guys  jon there was a whole bunch of these guys in robes it was really creepy  sam and dark hoods executionerstyle  jon yes matching robes and i got a really creepy feeling when i saw it besides being in /dung/ the  middle of a mountain  liam roughly how many  jon oh i dont know i mean it was dark  liam more than us  jon more than you  matt when you were there it wouldve been about 12 or 13 of them there  taliesin thats a lot of matching robes  liam and they all looked the same nobody looked a little more important than the others  jon i couldnt see their faces i couldnt see they were all covered in these robes  it felt like  laura how long ago was /none/ this  jon this was a couple months ago i mean you know i lost track of time when we  were on the ship  sam its a couple weeks  laughter  jon i was asleep for most of the ship ride i was pretty sick  laura i get sick too i understand  sam it was hard to tell his face is always green so we couldnt really tell  jon you guys were

and kaylie by a campfire and she was asking me about myself and my life and she has this /none/ thing  i dont know if its a spell or a special ability but she can always tell when im lying shes the  only one and i was trying to spin some sort of bullshit to her about my past and she called me  on it and said the truth let me hear it and i told her everything i told her about all the  lives i had ruined and about the women and about all the other kaylies out there that i know of  and the ones that i can only assume exist and everything /none/ and she spat at me and she gave me  this scar with her knife and she left and i thought that was it i had ruined it but before  dawn she came back and she unrolled her bedding and she went to sleep and woke up the next  morning and said whats for breakfast dad and i realized that ive been wrong that you dont  leave your shit behind and keep going you take it with you and the ones you surround yourself with  better get used to the smell and she stayed with me /none/ despite all my flaws and when i left you all  it was the first time that i had realized that you were all really flawed people really flawed  people and i left and i did not come back and i was wrong because family sticks around even if  you kind of hate the other person and i didnt i betrayed you  and ive lived with that shame for a year  liam are you happier now  sam well i

travis i reach across the table /none/ and i just punch him in the face  matt all right roll for an attack  liam i love the malice radiating this way and the absolute lack of recognition  marisha it stops here it stops at the camera line  travis 24  matt so whats your armor class  jon 18  matt 18 go ahead and roll for this here id say a d4 why not because you guys are pretty  beefy a d4 and add your strength modifier  travis nine ten sorry  matt he comes across and coldcocks you in the /tavern/ chin you take ten points of damage from a single  punch you feel a looseness to one of your back teeth and the white hits you and your vision  clears for a second and you look over and you see the beefy grayskinned goliath his fist still  extended as he pulls it back staring right at you  jon whoa that hurt  travis yeah this bar theres a lot more where that came from all you can eat yeah  jon show me that was awesome  travis rage  laura oh no oh no  /tavern/ travis total rage  liam were

heads  matt do you guys want to be in the same bar or not thats my question right now  laura we dont have to be okay then no were not there then  matt okay so youre not there this is happening between you guys grog goes into /tavern/ a rage  travis are we at a bar at a table  matt you guys are in a tavern theres a few people and as soon as that punch happened a few  people were like ooh in the background and as soon as you stand up and go into a rage people  begin to back out of the way tables are being pushed to the side  taliesin im pulling gold out to pay for this  jon i think its awesome im like i want to fight back but not its play for me now  /none/ matt so then i want you guys both to roll initiative  marisha grog dont kill him grog dont kill him  jon whats my initiative oh plus one so what is that a six thats a nine so ten  taliesin yep  jon ten  travis 14  matt all right so as you get up youre like all right and this guy youre used to being  the biggest guy in the room hes a little bigger than you  sam i taryon darrington rolled a 14  jon youre not here  sam im with you /none/ guys  matt he did come with them yeah  jon i thought you said oh taryon  sam im taryon darrington i stand up and i say ive seen this before he will attack brutally  drink this and i shove a swift step draught in his mouth you can run 80 feet now every turn  matt all right so you can move pretty fast if you want to  marisha keyleth is just watching intently and more importantly watching grog making sure he  doesnt actually beat him to death well stop this if it gets bad /tavern/  ashley i take a seat on a bar stool and just start drinking  taliesin yeah were sitting next to you  matt as youre preparing grog this guy whos a little larger than you are and as soon as he  stands up youre like oh and hes quicker than you thought grog what are you gonna do  travis are we at a table or the bar  matt you are yeah  travis at a table or at the bar  matt oh you were at a table within the bar  travis magnificent i flip /none/ up the table in my hands and i smash it over his head  matt okay go ahead and roll for an attack  taliesin that doesnt belong to you thats coming out of my coffer  travis 25  matt 25 okay that hits go ahead and roll another d4  jon so im quick but not that quick  travis 12  matt 12 points of bludgeoning damage to you as he smashes the table over your head lionel the wood  splinters and breaks around you and you hear the crack of the broken wood and you /none/ can feel the  splinters shred across the edge of your shoulders causing the burst of warmth and blood begin to  flow to the top of your shoulders and youre like oh this is exhilarating all right  thats your turn all right lionel youre up  jon okay to fight  taliesin you can do anything you like  jon yeah i definitely want to fight back because this is fun  taliesin cool here to help  matt its a bonus action to rage if you want  jon yeah but i like the what  matt /none/ its a bonus action to rage if you want to do that  jon yeah i saw his rage and i no im going to rage because i want to mimic like hey i can  rage too watch this so do i roll that  matt no no youre now raging so now your muscles swell the veins bulge out with this big  grin on his mouth when grogs raging grogs angry rage hes happy rage  jon oh check it out you can see my veins go jingling  matt so what do you want to do /none/ for your turn  jon i want to go and do so i run up to him and i go to do the really cool thing i heard in a  cool story where i twist up my fist and i go whoosh pow ive always wanted to try this  and this looks like a better time than ever to try it out  matt so roll for an attack and its plus ten well say plus ten for this  jon 17  matt whats your ac 17 go ahead and roll a d4 and add your strength /none/ modifier  which i think is a plus five  jon and i am looking for what  taliesin and you add five for your strength so you got  jon so eight  matt so eight points of bludgeoning damage you take four grog  sam plus three damage  matt oh plus three damage on top of that so eight so 11 sorry you take five  sam he takes halfdamage but you did great  matt youre both raging youre both taking the lesser damage of each hit  sam you get two attacks but youre raging /none/ so you get a third attack  matt no grog has that ability he has a different hes not a frenzy barbarian  sam but he does get two attacks  matt he does get two attacks so you get to attack again  jon this time i run around him because im super quick and like using this new speed ive never  experienced and i jump on his back from around and i try to choke him  taliesin grapple  matt go ahead and roll an athletics check  taliesin that plus ten  jon 23  /none/ matt you go ahead and roll an athletics or acrobatics check to resist it  sam oh shit his is huge  travis thats not great thats a 14  matt 14 you leap up behind him and put your arm up under his jaws like concrete but you still  find the one soft part and jam your bulging forearm up into that space and you feel the  windpipe choke close and clench in  travis choking sounds  matt and your really really fast feet are now dangling about two inches off the ground as youre  /none/ on his back right now thats the end of your turn youre currently grappled grog  what are you going to do  travis choking sounds im going to put it in reverse straight towards the wall  matt go ahead and roll are you just going to stay holding on as youre doing it  jon yeah yeah because this is the first piggyback hes ever had  matt its kind of fun for a second before you hit the wood wham ill say go ahead and roll a  strength saving throw to see if you can maintain /none/ the hold after the slam  jon 18  matt 18 okay id say thats enough for the strength of the hold so he keeps holding on after  the slam in the back anything else youre going to do with your turn  travis my action i take my elbow raise it up and drive it into his ribs  matt okay roll for an attack  travis yeah thats a 28  matt yeah so 1d4  sam now he has to roll damage  travis ten  matt so ten damage halved to five and you have /none/ an ability as reaction if you remember its in  your totem abilities that you can use as a reaction  jon oh off a ducks back  marisha off a ducks back  jon the duck is my animal totem you guys i can explain that later  matt so as you go to slam him with your elbow you hit but you feel like your elbow slips off  his body and doesnt quite do the damage you hoped it would so you take two points of damage  jon sweet  taliesin covered in duck butter  /none/ liam its the saxophone player from lost boys greased up  travis for my second attack can i throw my head back in a headbutt  matt go for it roll for an attack  travis yeah 23  matt all right so go ahead and roll 1d4 plus strength  travis 11  matt 11 so you take five points of bludgeoning damage because you can only use that reaction  once per round  jon i took five points  matt you have to use an action to try and break free of a grapple so you took /none/ five yeah so  now its back to your turn he slammed you into the wall hes elbowed you twice in the stomach  youve resisted some of it youre still holding him there  jon okay  matt so if you wanted to because of one of the feats you have you could turn that into a pin if  you wanted to  jon one of the feats i have  matt yeah its on the bottom  jon now this is turning into a wrestling match i like that  matt or you could just keep whaling /none/ on him  jon i want to take him out not kill hes just having fun  marisha its going down in the whole foods parking lot  jon so im still hanging on him  matt yeah youre holding onto him by throat he slammed you against the wall hes elbowed you in  the stomach twice  jon im again having fun superspeed im going to while holding onto him crawl up his back and  jump over and try to land and try to do the move where i do that and throw him  all yeah /tavern/  jon yeah against one of the pillars in the bar away from the innocent people  matt make an athletics check and you have advantage on this because youre raging so you  roll twice and take the higher of the two  jon oh its just the best  taliesin roll again yeah roll again best of two better  jon 22  matt okay 22 grog im going to say because youre grappled go ahead and roll an athletics  check with disadvantage  travis you got it  matt it should be one roll because youre /none/ raging you also  get advantage on it technically  travis just one roll 24  matt 24 you reach off you leap over and you grab him and you go to pull and its like pulling  a pillar not budging you can try again if you want to or do something else  marisha oh because he has a second  matt he has a second attack yeah  jon i tried to jump over so now im just actually i did the flip but i didnt pull him so  now im just hanging on the front /none/ of him im still holding on  but now im in front of him dangling  matt hes standspooning you  travis what is this  jon yeah so now i  sam reverse piledrive  taliesin go for it dont think act  jon well i want to start  marisha what would chode do  jon well this is play for him so i dont know this is not an attack i just want to tickle him  kind of grinding on him in a way trying to use that to his advantage to make him uncomfortable  /none/ matt make an intimidation check  jon thats an intimidation okay  matt against grog yeah  jon 27  taliesin oh grogs ticklish  matt grog make a wisdom saving throw  travis minus two four  jon you guys get what im doing  matt im going to say for the purposes of this it catches you so offguard and its so unexpected  that youre stunned for the next round  all oh  matt as you do that you see him walk up and he starts pushing you away  jon does he let go i /none/ can let go now  matt you can let go yeah hes like uh uh you get a full other turn  what are you going to do  jon can i run back and then do a yelling and then i just dive in with the biggest punch i can  matt go for it you back away you leap  jon yeah everything i can put into it all force because  i still want to get a good punch in there  matt yeah go ahead and roll for an attack if you want it you can /none/ make it reckless  jon yeah hes definitely reckless  matt so roll twice and take the higher on each attack  jon 15 what is that  taliesin thats a 20  sam oh that crits  matt go ahead and roll a d4  taliesin hes also got brutal critical so that adds 2d6 to that but well get to that  matt technically it would add a d4 because hes not using his sword so roll that twice and then  add your strength  jon 15  sam but hes raging so another three  jon /none/ 16  matt 16 points of bludgeoning damage to you grog thats eight  travis eight got it  laura how are you doing grog are you still okay are you bloodied yet  sam hes down 22 hit points  matt as your first attack you run in right as soon as he looks up youre smiling as you come at  him you watch as the beard shakes in opposition of the jaw quiver and you feel and can taste the  iron welling up in the back of your tongue as you may have bitten off a /none/ small piece of the back of  your tongue as soon as you land from that punch he looks a little stunned you have a second  attack if you want to  jon im going to do my wave kick thats just something hes always wanted to try he doesnt  know if itll work its where he does a fullbody  and then his foot kicks him right in the groin  matt awesome youve practiced this alone many times this is your first chance to actually use  it so go ahead and make an attack for /none/ your wave kick  jon right in the crotch  liam lionel with his nunchucks in the family den  matt basically  jon so just an attack  matt well its reckless so you roll twice take the higher  taliesin roll again better  jon 17  matt so go ahead and roll a d4 and add your damage  jon one  sam plus five is six  taliesin no you only roll the d4 once  sam so one plus five plus three  matt okay so nine you take four points of bludgeoning damage grog /none/ and you just took a  swift wave kick to the groin as he kind of whack little snap right to the nuts so its  not like an immediate pain its the tap the dull nausea pain and he seems to shake a little from  the impact as he kinda grins and glares at you with his angry eyes well done grog  ashley deadpan grog stop no dont kill him  travis im so confused ive never had another male do that to my body he shimmied on me and  then he punched me and then /none/ he kicked me in the
