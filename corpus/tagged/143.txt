town	 matt cassandra remembering this drags her body through what remnant is there on the ground  theres a big groove left behind her as shes being dragged through it you get to the second  trap that she marked and you guys make your way around it you make your way to where the road  diverges the one way to the castle and the one to the acid pits and cassandra heads towards the  acid pits  laura cassandra what are you doing  travis shes throwing them in the acid pits  matt she doesnt look back 
none	 at you she just keeps walking you follow her for about five minutes  marisha are we sure this wont make anything bad happen if we throw a body into the acid pits  taliesin i think its fine  travis i think its acid  marisha okay  matt after about five minutes of following her the path leads up and then crests and there is a  room that smells awful its similar to the acrid scent the room was filled with when the acid was  pouring into the room theres a whole series of other chemicals 
none	 and inside you can see theres a  number of laboratory setups near you you get the feeling this is probably where a lot of this  particular acidic concoction that was finetuned for this stone of whitestone was created or at  least honed by ripley without a beat cassandra walks up to the edge and just throws delilahs  body in plop sizzle then it disappears beneath the surface as the hissing bubbling noise takes  over the silence of the room she sits there and just watches it sink  laura well  liam she brought a 
none	 lot of ill to this world dont feel too bad  matt cassandra turns back around  taliesin she was too dangerous to let live  marisha what about you how do you feel  sam hows that gun barrel of yours  marisha yeah  taliesin i pull out the broken barrel and inspect it  matt looking at it you can see delilahs name is missing from the barrel entirely cassandras  name is still on the barrel and so is ripleys  go ahead and make an investigation check  taliesin i had some thoughts but yeah

none	 okay you take a moment and eventually manage to scar and dissolve enough of the exterior  of that barrel until the name is no longer visible  taliesin i think its fine  sam scoffs you think its fine  laura lovely  taliesin youre going to have to have some faith  sam i dont have any faith here well make a deal ill let you keep that gun if you give me  the other one  taliesin no  laughter  laura so glad that your smoke monster is seemingly gone percy thats wonderful news the 
town	  spinning orb of death however is still back there so we should probably figure out what to do  about that  taliesin well i think perhaps we can talk to keeper yennen perhaps put together some priests  to deal with that enlist the help of the entire town now that theres no longer  a revolution to be fought  travis yeah thats a solid plan  marisha oh the revolution  taliesin we forgot about that  marisha we should go stop the fighting right we should probably let them know its over  laura probably 
none	  travis well if theyre fighting wouldnt it mean its not over  marisha well im sure they dont know that the briarwoods are dead  taliesin so perhaps if we tell everyone the briarwoods are dead cassandra  travis maybe well see ripley on the way out  taliesin wouldnt that be nice  sam i just had a thought percy i cast friends on him  matt okay  sam i think i know how to fix your gun if you hand it to me  taliesin never in my right mind would i hand my gun

none	  travis front door  matt front door all right grog walks up to the front door being careful of the scattered  caltrops you guys left there the door is still ajar from where you left it as you step out and  look into the daylight and its at this point now probably midafternoon pushing into evening  you guys have been traveling underground for quite some time and taken a few short rests and have  had a lot of conflict and things happen so you started at the start of the day youre now  pushing 
none	 into towards dusk but as you open up and look outside with what daylight is still there  you see little plumes of smoke coming from the far city down the pathway that leads up to castle  whitestone you see about 70 to 100 armored humanoids marching up towards the front of the  castle  sam humanoids  matt bipedal  travis can i pick up my caltrops  matt you begin to pick up your caltrops  laura i know what this is  travis well theyre good guys  sam no it could be an undead 
none	 army  matt make a perception check  laura i know what this is do i need roll perception if i know what it is  marisha yeah i was going to say  travis wow 19 minus  marisha 20  taliesin 27  sam five  laura 15  matt all right as you guys get your weapons at the ready  taliesin 25 sorry did the math wrong  matt 25 okay percy and vax you notice the people approaching spattered in mud and various  types of ichor or blood as they get closer you can 
none	 see beneath the helmets tired human faces  stepping up the side weapons at the ready as they approach the very front of the line you see  keeper yennen equally exhausted stepping forward essentially ready to storm the castle  you see behind them as they approach a scattered cluster of broken corpses some human some a  little less human it looks like the rebellion army seems to have cut its way through the  remaining defenders of castle whitestone and are making their way towards the front of the castle  as they get closer they meet 
none	 your gaze and the front of the group draw their weapons and yennen  steps forwards a little bit you there percival  taliesin i step forward  matt vox machina are your wits about you  travis yes  marisha yes  taliesin the briarwoods are dead  marisha its true  liam serpents head has been cut off but there is much to do  marisha is it still cloudy  matt its a little cloudy its not rainstorm ready but theres still sort  of an overcast feel  marisha im going to go ahead and at 
none	 third level because thats all i got left cast skywrite  again and throw up the de rolo crest once again in the sky  matt okay as you begin to coalesce the clouds and the symbol and the shapes you see a bunch of  the soldiers look around and yennen steps forward again towards you and goes reaching up holding  his holy symbol of erathis to his chest he goes are you certain this is done percival  taliesin theres still a great evil beneath the castle but the briarwoods are no more  matt he turns 
town	 around looks to his men who are all looking at him expectantly well you heard  the man the briarwoods are dead whitestone is free once more he looks up to the sky as the  symbol finishes from keyleths spell the de rolos are in power once again  at which point the entire crowd shouts yeah their weapons to the sky and as the shouts begin  to echo down into the valley of whitestone you can see little lights begin to burn in the distance  little notification lanterns that are being lit and set at windowtops 
none	 at the top of the mountain  and you can see this look of relief and joy on every soldiers face as they all realize that the  death they were all marching to face is no longer a threat cassandra at this point is still  standing behind you at your side and really for the first time since all of this went down  beneath you see a smile on her face  yennen turns around again and approaches you all sighs i dont know what to say well come  theres much to discuss let us step 
none	 from this foul place for the time being men walk through  make sure its clean and the some of the soldiers  marisha no  taliesin theres still a matter of some things beneath the castle that we must deal with first  marisha no one should be allowed in for right now until we figure this out  matt very well men seal the doors seal the entrances keep watch  marisha we really need to rest  matt then come youve certainly earned it and he motions to a few of the guards  marisha what time 
none	 of day is it do we have a sense is the sun still up  matt the suns still up but you can see from the light source and the darkening of the sky and the  color pushing from a general whitegrey its going a little more reddishorange  marisha before we take a rest im going to look at percy and im going to be like ill catch up  with you guys i think the people need to see the sun and im going to go into my air elemental  form go up into the sky 
none	 above whitestone and do my whirlwind ability and start trying to just push  all of the clouds out of the way to let the sun in  matt all right as you guys begin  laura oh did she freeze  sam shes frozen in a beautifully surprised expression  matt she can still hear us  laura oh she can still hear us but shes frozen  sam surprise  matt you guys begin to march down towards the city with the rest of the army a group of about  ten men stay behind just to guard 
none	 the castle as you make you way to the northern side of  whitestone and you enter the streets again you can see families beginning to walk out of their  homes in the streets in the entirety of your time here in whitestone most folks that didnt need to  be out in the open stayed indoors and you begin to realize this seeming ghost city was hiding a  lot more life and a lot more hope than you had expected and you see families and children  stepping out and as you walk through the streets you 
none	 can see the kids wave you meet eyes with some  of the possible widows who mouth to you thank you  liam seeing that  taliesin can we pass by the alcove  liam seeing that im going to do the buddy arm around the shoulder and pull my sister in close  matt okay  sam clears throat i walk up to a particularly handsome widow and i say your husband  laura pike is right here  sam oh your husband died for a good cause thanks bye  laughter  taliesin pike is shocked pike is 
none	 shocked and offended  sam why are you looking at me like that pike pike stop it  matt as you walk away she looks really confused and clutches her chest in horror for a moment as  one of the soldiers walking with you steps by her side looking at you curiously and gives her a  kiss on the cheek she goes who was that man  sam oh sorry  taliesin can we definitely want to go lets stop by the alcove  matt okay you eventually start making your way towards the alcove as you  
none	 enter deeper into the city  liam pike you there can you hear us  marisha have i cleared up enough of the sky at this point  matt were going to get to that right now actually  marisha i want to get to that  matt as you guys are stepping im sorry what  sam no its okay  matt pushing further in you can see now the clouds beginning to dissipate and also for the  first time since youve been here you see blue sky directly above the city the vibrant  orangeredpurple colors of 
none	 the sunset now come cascading along the city of whitestone and  theres a collective gasps an inhale and gasp of awe from the soldiers and the people alike as  this opens up above you you begin to walk past the alcoves to your left if you wish to  taliesin i want to stop in  matt okay as you start heading towards the alcove you can see jordana is already out on the front  stoop looking up at the sky she looks over and sees you percival  taliesin i give her a big hug  
none	 matt it takes her by surprise at the moment and then she gives in and  continues to give the hug back  taliesin this would not have been possible without your help thank you for everything  matt of course she leans into the hug a little bit then nods and then raises her head did you  see my father  taliesin i have not we have not searched the castle yet though  laura we just left it we havent searched the castle  marisha we searched a little bit  laura but there could be live 
none	 people in there when we sealed it  taliesin we dont know its not airtight or anything i mean theyre breathing  sam ripleys gone and also theres a goliath on the loose  matt as you say this keeper yennen goes not anymore there isnt follow me  all ooh  sam are there any young boys around  matt he stops in his tracks and looks over his shoulder and goes what  sam i just need a young fleetfooted boy  travis see the last time i asked for a young boy people gave me shit too 
none	  taliesin no were going to give him shit theres no problem here  matt he slowly turns away and keeps walking forward  sam or a girl no wait that sounds weird  travis yep you cant say it in a right way its impossible innocent request  matt the people have begun following behind your procession towards the center of the city  liam bring me your smallest most helpless child  laughter  ashley oh god  travis thats fucked up  taliesin thats going to explode  sam all right show us what you want to 
none	 show us yennen  matt you see behind you soldiers reuniting with their families friends gathering in the streets  and the people of whitestone are now beginning to join the sides of your procession towards the  center of the sun square in the middle of whitestone as you crest into the outskirts of the  square yennen gives a couple of whispered orders to a couple of the soldiers who rush off you can  see people are now gathering in the center and theres actually people  gathering around the sun tree  as they all step 
town	 to the sun tree its a little quiet and keeper yennen reaches up and pulls his  holy symbol of erathis again looks up to the tree and looks back at the rest of you and goes for  generations it was those of the zenith who looked over this tree and these people here and it was  by the evil that once held foot in this town that father reynal the last of his line was slain we  will work to find those who wish to take up the mantle to clean and rebuild the zenith the 
none	  pinnacle of pelors grace here in whitestone but until that i yennen swear to make this trees  safety my responsibility this symbol of hope this center of the crest of your family has held  the slivers of light in our hearts for a very long time  let us all take a moment and thank the heroes who made this freedom possible to the strong mountain  of joy and bravery grog to the gentle to the kind to the just soul pike to the swift of bow  keen of sight and the most adorable creature 
none	 to accompany her as trinket steps forward and  nuzzles your side trinket by the agility by the cunning by the loyalty of vax by the  cleverness by the wit and the strange interests of scanlan by the honesty by the nature and  connection with the world and the wonder of keyleth and by the strength of blood and the  willingness to sacrifice   ashley mic bump  matt pardon me  laughter  matt damn it  sam start that one again  liam its still very beautiful  marisha so beautiful  taliesin two 
none	 years on a sitcom i can hold this all day  laughter  matt god damn it  laura percivals just waiting for his introduction  liam to the stonecold motherfucker on air  matt to the return of those valiants we once thought lost and those who rise up to restore the  joy of these people percival may we raise our weapons our glasses and our children who accept  this future to rebuild raise to vox machina hyah and everyone raises as one loud  travis yeah vox machina  matt as the sun slowly sets the 
town	 light coming through in beautiful colors now you see what was  once a very bleak town suddenly be renewed with a spectrum of new accents you begin to hear music  being played as now the celebration begins with the suns setting folks are turning this into a  full celebration now people are starting to bring out food and  marisha block party  matt laughs you feel this sense that this is the first time in a long time the people have ever  really been allowed to be happy about something and the energy is infectious 
dung	 in itself as the  celebration begins though yennen puts up his hand and people begin to slow and calm as  men begin to bring forward two individuals in chains one of which you see is a halforc female  in dark brown leather armor she is chained and thrown onto her knees onto the ground and she  spits you can see theres a few cuts across her face and she looks dirty and right next to her  taking four men to do so a goliath whos bruised is also thrown onto his knees and theyre both 
town	  just held at that place  yennen says the two remaining new nobles given power here as they aided the briarwoods in taking  this city we have duke which the people spit at the sound of the name goran vedmeyer and  countess jazna graben you have been found guilty of treason against this town of the  responsibility of many lives lost innocent and for furthering the plans of the evil that has  oppressed us so long i would wish that you the ones who freed us deliver the judgment  travis laughs  laura come 
none	 on  travis no that sounds fair ive known to preside over many legal matters in my time as  judgeface of northwind  liam define legal  marisha define judgeface  travis it would just baffle all of you its all right  sam grog if i may i can assist you in this if youd like  travis oh why of course subjudge scanlan  sam thank you grog percival this is your kingdom so if you  taliesin i leave it to you  laura no  travis yes even better  sam these two have done 
none	 much violence to this place they represent all that is evil  matt wait and goran who is now down on the ground looks up at you and goes i know you  sam never saw you before friend  taliesin this is what i really wanted to see  sam you have a lovely house by the way or had one  laughter  matt spits on the ground at your feet  sam might need a new roofer anyway in a show of grace and to demonstrate our new hope that we have  for this place i 
none	 suggest that we dont kill these two  travis what  sam but rather force them to help rebuild the place that they helped destroy  laura in chains very heavy chains  sam one of them at least is extremely strong the other one must have some sort of skill  matt she for the first time looks up with this gnarly toothy grin you can see these partially  broken and jagged teeth in her mouth and she goes come closer ive never tasted gnome  sam okay so maybe well kill her  laura would you rather 
none	 die  travis what kind of weapons did these two have on them  matt the men look about themselves and yennen not entirely certain however she has been known  to carry a quiver or two and this one here wields a blade as long as his body  liam the briarwoods are broken and gone you can die today or you can take your licks and help  rebuild this city no one is here to protect you or save you you can work hard start again  matt make a persuasion check with advantage based on their 
none	 current circumstance  liam intimidation you said or persuasion  matt whichever youd prefer  liam its average its 13  matt 13 okay you can see the goliath vedmeyer lowers his head i accept jazna  she looks over it seems you lack what has kept me alive all these years a spine kill me id  rather not stay at your beck and call  travis okay  taliesin grog  travis i reach over and i take out my greataxe and i aim it for her neck  matt okay as did you swing or just aim 
none	 it  travis yeah swing for the neck beheadingstyle  matt make a strength check  travis natural 20  laughter  liam merry christmas travis  matt as you pull the axe out and you walk alongside with it almost like a cane  look down at her  travis yeah like a cane  matt impact noise and with speed and deftness where no one sees the blade make contact there is  a moment where the head just drifts off the form leaving the base the throat cleanly cleaven  cloven if you will sorry theres a 
town	 moment of pause before the blood begins to pour from the  wound it was so fast and so immediate and the body just slumps forward theres a gasp in the  crowd suddenly and then a cheer as the locals now see one of the people that probably oppressed  tortured and killed many of their folk now lies on the ground killed  travis i look at the axe and look at the blood covering it and i look over at duke gonad and i  say so where are you from and how did you come to 
town	 be in the service of the briarwoods  matt i was hired in wildmount  travis do i know where that is  matt you dont youve heard it said before youve heard it mentioned but you have no idea  where it is  travis right the holy lands of the sacred all right  sam are you okay your honor  travis yes thank you for i am quite tired would you like to take it from here  sam no  taliesin while we always must dispense our justice this is now a town of mercy as 
none	 well and  i will expect nothing less from all of us than to give what we have lacked for so long duke  sam let hers be the last blood shed  taliesin earn your life again  matt he nods and looks down you cant tell if its shame or just defeat but his shoulders slump  and that little bit of fire that was in him when he arrived is broken the men look at you they  get your nod and they lift the chains and pull them off while a couple of the men pick 
town	 up the  body of the halforc woman and pull them out of the crowd the music swells up once again and the  celebration continues without a beat you can now see tables being brought out to the center and  glasses are set about and drinks are being poured as a giant central table right at the base of the  sun tree is set for you  taliesin theyve just had this shit in a tupperware container like in those big bins in  the back for the last five years with like ducttape lids  matt 
none	 its not a grand meal there hasnt been a lot of time to prepare for it but basically what  it looks like is whoever is preparing dinner or whatever food was readily available theyre just  bringing it out its more of like a sharewithwhoeversthere type effort  marisha aw its a potluck  matt kind of  sam i find a young boy  matt yes scanlan  sam or a soldier and i give him 15 gold and i say  for the love of god find me a fucking beret  matt all right sir and 
none	 the boy takes the gold and rushes off looking in his hands at the boon  hes been given by this practicallysameheight man they dont see gnomes here very often its  been very confusing  taliesin i want to take some time to tell keeper yennen about what is beneath the tree and let him  start to macerate some theories on what to do  travis macerate thats a big word  matt after you finish this conversation he sits there and  taliesin its a word for big name thank you do it  matt a few 
none	 moments pass before the boy returns in his hand a singing raspberry beret the kind  you find in a secondhand store  sam oh feels good  laura make it look cooler on him because he made it look dorky  taliesin its a beret i dont think he made it dorky i think it comes with  that already sewn in  laura there it is looks good it looks good scanlan  sam thank you young boy whatever your name was what was your name young boy  marisha make it good  matt randall  sam 
town	 thank you randall youve made me a very happy small man  matt and he brings you the change  sam oh no keep the change its all right go buy yourself a goose the biggest goose in town  laughter  taliesin with a beret  matt and he darts off excitedly you catch him out of the corner of your eye like stealing a swig  of beer  sam brandon gilmore that was his young name  laura brandon gilmore  sam yes  matt thank you brandon so after you finish regaling this tale to keeper 
town	 yennen lets see if  i have a proper song for celebration  travis im doing my best to empty the cask of ale into the town patrons and myself  taliesin i dont know if thats less aviary than celebratory  matt yeah unfortunately  marisha can keyleth go over and check out the sun tree  matt sure as youre walking over there well finish this conversation here yennen nods to  himself and goes that is disconcerting ill reach out to a few of my contacts see who we can  bring here to inspect it i 
town	 may go down tomorrow myself and have a look is it safe  taliesin no there are traps weve marked them its also disturbing  matt all right ill bring a trusted team down then if theres anyone you know who has vast  historical or arcane knowledge i would recommend possibly having them come take a look as well  unfortunately im rather limited in my teachings  sam pike  laura allura  sam but shes not in town  taliesin we can send word  matt please do  laura what about ryndarien  marisha eskil  
town	 matt there was eskil ryndarien the archmage in westruun  liam yes either both  matt good good yes anyone at all maybe ill be able to glean something but unfortunately most  of our books were confiscated when the town was taken however i appreciate that and at least  for the time being there doesnt seem to be any dead rising from the grave  sam if i may percy may i make a suggestion  taliesin is it going to be throwing the rest of my guns into a pit of acid  sam no but it 
none	 will be spending some of your kingdoms money  taliesin replacing the guns that you threw into a pit of acid  sam lets not talk about the guns  taliesin i really cant think of what else id want to talk about please go ahead  sam if most of their books have been taken from them perhaps we could use some of the treasury to  build a library  taliesin that is not a terrible idea and its possible that the books are still within the  castle  laura its possible that the briarwoods have hoarded 
none	 all of them in fact we might find  something about this entity inside the castle  taliesin and we do need to build three new structures where the lords houses were and i  find the idea of rebuilding those mansions to be a bit distasteful  sam perhaps we could even name one of the libraries gilmores glorious books  travis set up a satellite chain  taliesin we will discuss it its got a ring i will admit  matt while you guys are having this conversation  liam oh i was just going to add to 
dung	 that im sure the man can help  in this citys time of need  taliesin you were doing something as well  matt yes keyleth at this point as youve walked away from this conversation you approach  the sun tree it stands there with a little bit of light as the suns just now passing over the  distant mountain range that surrounds this valley the skys growing more purple and dark blue but  now lights have been lit and lanterns have been brought to the center you can see the sun tree in  full before 
none	 you  marisha i reach up and i put my hand on it and i cast commune with nature do i gather anything  matt what does commune with nature do in full  taliesin it lets you commune with nature  marisha essentially  matt oh look at that first page i open up to okay  taliesin its like a dm version of natural 20  laura it is except he does it all the time  matt okay so which do you want to know of all the things that you can choose from  marisha oh 
town	 what are my choices  matt you can choose from terrain or bodies of water in the vicinity prevalent plants minerals  animals or peoples powerful celestials fey fiends or elementals or undead within 300 feet of  it or sorry within three miles of it influence from other planes of existence or buildings  marisha the influence of other planes of existence sounds promising  matt okay you gain three facts so first off you notice as you touch the sun tree and you cast  the spell whereas previously you felt just dead wood and a lack of 
none	 any presence there is a small  seed of life in the tree once again  marisha thats good  matt well call that the first one as a given as you inquire about any other planes of  existence you do sense that at least some element nearby relates to a realm of shadow  laura thats obvious  marisha yeah sure okay  matt and whats the third one you want to know  marisha oh i get a choice  matt yep  marisha i didnt know i had a choice  matt you dont have to
