happened to that plan of rolling out one a day  once a week yeah that plan didnt turn out to be feasible and i might have said that i said  it and then i looked down at the announcement sheet and it said in parenthesis afterward but  do not announce this part which why was it even on our announcement sheet still my fault  matt to be fair i remember /dung/ looking down at the sheet as you were announcing it  marisha oh shit anyway its never going to happen because theyre easier to do in batch so  ten at a time thats what you get  taliesin its like one cookie at a time you cant bake one cookie at a time  marisha its just better to do them in a block  matt thank you for the headsup on that we announced a while back the critical role sixissue  miniseries comic book we announced last

covered  matt all right well cool guys thank you so much thank you for dealing with our long  announcements its been a few weeks however i think with that its time to /none/ dive into tonights  episode of critical role  dramatic music  matt welcome back ill remember this whys everything targeting scanlan in this battle  welcome back everyone so last we left off vox machina preparing themselves for a final fray  with the recently ascended god vecna the undying king discovered that he had brought the city of  thar amphala about 300 miles northwest of vasselheim on the continent of issylra upon  gathering allies to assail this region you discovered that it was shifting moving and  apparently the corpse of the long dead primordial earth /none/ titan had been risen and began marching its  way towards vasselheim with thar amphala embedded at the top of its torso protected by some sort of  magical barrier  with an advance army of wyvern riders at your back and jmon sa ord giving you a ride between their  wings you made your way southward quickly depositing yourselves within a waterfall  expelling opening towards the hip of this large titan undead beast you began to fight your way to  the interior dealing with corrupted earth elemental shards you began to make your way  through /none/ the catacombs the long ruined and abandoned dwarven city of thomara where you  encountered the tomb of the dwarven king where you also managed to raid the tomb found a magical  item and dealt with some fun traps in the process then continuing to follow where this  route led you upward hopefully towards the underbelly of the city of thar amphala you  uncovered a mostly cleaned out vault and did battle with some undead trolls that immediately  rushed in and attacked you you managed to destroy them and make your way out through a small /none/ cavern  that had just momentarily collapsed clearing out of the way you all began to squeeze through the  opening to find the next length of your journey  and thats where we left off as you guys all crawl through this recently cleared opening you  come into a partially collapsed cavern about 20 or so feet wide in places with elements of the  ceiling fallen in you can see the rocks that are scattered amongst the ground rumbling with each  impact of the feet of the titan youre currently riding within it seems to be /none/ going at a steady  incline beginning baseline and then about 20 feet ahead begin to rise upward to about a 30 to  45degree angle with the next 25 30 or so feet  sam how do you play dungeons and dragons  matt two weeks sam its too much for you  sam ive forgotten entirely what were supposed to do now insight check i got nothing  liam im going to do my due diligence and scoot a little ahead of everybody and start looking for  traps or anything hinky  travis wait vax you should /none/ consult that little scrawny npc fellow that was supposed oh wait  oh hes dead  liam did anybody see that guy  travis nope  laura yeah we did we saw him  matt well you saw the corpse after it was there yeah  liam nobody asked me about him  laura no because you did a good job of killing that  liam that clearly undead cannibal dwarf eating flesh as i saw it so problem solved were on a  time table yeah  laura we should keep moving upwards im assuming  sam did we /none/ get any items recently  travis no i picked up that hammer that was hitting me in the face  laura well yeah but percy the belt  sam yeah what does it do  taliesin stuff things im using it right now  marisha do we need to do a switcherypoo of our items  laura i think we maybe should do that actually  sam we all have potions right did we pass out potions  travis we all have at least the one superior from the brass dragon  liam are we going to take a little /none/ 20minute breather here  sam this is just for us to remember what were doing i dont know should we stop i think were  on a timetable we should keep moving right does anyone need to heal  marisha we just stopped right  matt youd taken a brief rest after the battle with the trolls where you guys began to look about  the inside of the vault and thats where the part of the exit collapsed  travis i didnt roll any hit dice should we roll some hit dice  marisha you dug things out  /none/ laura but he was doing something he was reading or something  sam yeah you were trying to read dwarvish or something and it took an hour  travis i clearly do not remember this thats right i remember i dont remember what i read  but i remember  sam it just said do not enter  travis yep there were things  liam were doing the vox machina thing and standing around like a bunch of dumb fucks trying  to figure out what to do im going to attune the deathwalkers ward to necrotic damage  matt /none/ all righty necrotic it is  travis we also need to be on the lookout for that sword remember in the story  sam the sword of kas  travis just saying keep your eyes peeled highperception people  laura all right  taliesin i literally cant see anything  laura wait we have light  marisha whoosh  laura yeah see  matt between her hand his dagger and pikes mace you have a few light sources  that you guys maintain  laura pikes mace is lit up we said that last time  matt but do keep /dung/ in mind that light sources also do make you a bright beacon in dark places  laura probably your hands are less noticeable than pikes mace  liam oh i dont know  taliesin i think they would be less intimidated by a glowing mace than by  glowing hands at this point  matt glowing hands is like a small torch firelight the mace of disruption  liam is like a headlamp  laura so maybe well not have the mace on  liam yeah okay ill put this away  laura that sounded just like her  sam /none/ shes turning more and more canadian as you go  liam shes kind of canadian already come on  matt so if i could have a marching order please  liam yo up front looking for traps  laura did you want this acidresistant armor youd at least be resistant to acid  travis and vex is probably with her brother ill be right behind the twins its the twins and then  me who wants to be behind  taliesin ill be behind you  matt okay do you have trinket out vex  laura yeah trinket is out /none/  matt percys after grog  marisha me  matt keyleth and then we have pike and scanlan holding up the rear all righty there you go  have that marked down how far ahead are you tracking  liam 20 feet  matt so 20 feet ahead you begin to make your way up the incline and it is loose rock in this  tunnel as you step there are elements that skid and fall beneath the pressure of your feet and  you have to be careful as you progress up the incline based on how much it /none/ continues upward to  keep your footing  laura brother  liam yeah  laura make sure you stay within 60 feet of me  liam i turn around and look at her and go all right  laura you said youre 20 fucking feet in front of me im using my fucking  earring to whisper to you  liam youre stagewhispering and thats very easy to hear  laura stay within fucking 60 feet of me all right  liam i love you perception check investigation for traps yeah that is a 25  matt okay no traps /none/ catch your attention as you progress forward you begin to notice the tunnel  seems to be pincering a bit the further you go the sides of the walls begin to close in and  eventually about 30 feet ahead comes from the 15 20foot width that the initial entrance way  into this carved tunnel was pinches to about three feet wide  sam how tall  matt about five and half six feet tall  taliesin is this pressure by design or is this whats been done to the  structure by the transformation  matt youll probably /dung/ have to get closer to see where you are currently it looks like part of the  tunnel was carved outward and then shaken and elements of it collapsed and loosened the earth  that at one point was packed at the sides  laura and the tunnels rising steadily upwards  matt yeah its coming at an incline  travis hows it look  liam its dark up there i can only see about 60 feet up does it keep going beyond that  matt the incline isnt increasing it gets to about a 45degree incline and then maintains /none/ that  up until the outside of your visual range  liam okay im a punching bag for this shit why dont you all wait here a minute wait  all wait  laura do you want me to fly up there  liam well will you go with me  laura of course can you not use your wings  liam theyre gone  laura well then hop on  liam this could be the last time we do this come on  sam oh god  liam well theres only four games left sam  laura you dont /none/ know that  liam its scripted  laughter  marisha thats going to be a reddit thread later  laura do we have pass without a trace on  liam yeah i think that probably faded by now  matt not if you havent recast it because after the short rest it wouldve been gone  laura should i cast that on us  liam yes  laura no wait i shouldnt because i got a proficiency so were both stealthy stealth were  fine so were just going to go im not casting it but heres the thing everybody /none/ stay right at  the bottom were going to fly up but were not going to fly up more than 60 feet away from them  liam right well go 60 feet up see what we can see  laura and then come back down  liam sure or you could stay there and i could go even further up 60 feet  laura all right as long as everybodys within 60 feet of me because were getting really close and  i dont want vecna to see us ive got this ring  taliesin thats right i forgot about /none/ the ring  liam all right lets do that  matt so as you guys glide up on the broom stealthily i want you guys both to roll a stealth  check please  travis pick from your fucking 300 dice  laura ooh thats good  travis almost poked my eye out you almost made me vecna  laura 30  liam 29  laura 30  matt all right thats impressive so as you both quietly coast your way past this entrance way  squeezing into this two and a half threefootwide location you get just within the /none/  60 foot range and look up and vax you step off the broom and make your way quietly up to the  other side of the range you get about 30 feet beyond the broom before your vision meets where  this tunnel seems to end and it looks like there is a solid rocky blockage  laura what do you see  liam its corked up its all right yeah its blocked up with stone i guess id have to get a  closer look to see if we could get through  laura well get a fucking /none/ closer look  taliesin if we have to we can just have grog beat it down  laura yes but quiet is the key word  taliesin is it we can try and time it to a step  liam hand on the sides to get my way up closer to it looking for any traps  matt go ahead and make an athletics check as youre climbing up to maintain the strength as  the incline is now towards the end getting more and more steep  liam get ready to catch me  laura im going to hover /none/  liam yes my athletics is a two but i rolled a 19 so 21  matt deftly you manage to find the proper handholds and pull your strength up as the final  bit becomes a little bit of a upper body weight carrying situation and you come to the edge of  the rock and you see it it does appear to be a rocky cavein or larger boulder that has fallen or  been placed to close it looks to be one solid rock yeah at this point the entrance is about  four foot by two /none/ foot and its all blocked by one solid piece of rock  liam yeah were not getting through this hey im not getting through this youre not  maybe kiki can  laura do we see any other openings  matt this would be a perception check  sam matt my friends just told me to start paying attention to the cadence of the steps to see if  they change in any discernible way  marisha thats what were doing while they do that were timing the steps out  matt make a perception check  laura 20  /none/ matt 20 okay  taliesin and marisha ugh  sam 15  marisha 15  taliesin 12  matt its not that difficult to discern the pattern of the steps the entirety of this titan  shifts and quakes with each footfall so its pretty easy to find the pattern it rarely  changes and you imagine any slight shift that you feel as theyre going about this is because its  stepping on or through terrain that is not flat but it is a pretty discernible pattern  taliesin we could go have grog smash it down in tempo /none/ with the steps so that the  sound will be covered  travis like shawshank redemption and the poop pipe  taliesin i was thinking of the tainted love levis commercial  laura do i see any other  matt not really it mostly looks like loose rock and the more you glance about with each impacting  footfall you see two or three errant rocks go you guys watch as more rocks tumble  down the incline  laura maybe we need to do this quickly this doesnt seem like the most stable sort of tunnel  hop on /none/ the broom darling  taliesin i like the idea of you punching this at the appropriate moment  marisha it also saves me a 6thlevel spell  travis well thats whats most important are the knuckles still doing that vibrating hum thing  matt yeah  travis can i go into a rage  matt you may  travis and i would like to try and bash the shit out of this  taliesin and laura in tempo  matt this is a tight tunnel for you you have to crouch down round your shoulders  as youre doing it /none/  travis im going to do the oneinch punch  matt make an athletics check with advantage because you are raging  travis yeah because im an angry monster 21  matt okay heres the scenario vex and vax as you guys are on the broom in the tunnel you look  down and you know in labyrinth when the cleaner comes through the tunnel that fills the entirety  of the space you watch as this angry goliath starts up the tunnel towards you and there does  not appear to be much of any space you could squeeze /none/ through  liam is there a bubble at the top maybe  laura grog  travis what angry panting  laura can we pass under his legs or something  liam dive dive  laura rage quietly  matt you can both attempt to make an acrobatics check to attempt to squeeze between his legs  laura at the same time acrobatics 22  liam 30something  matt its not comfortable but you both popping out the back between his monstrous goliath  thighs from a backward perspective those of you who are still waiting a little further down the /none/  tunnel from vex its a unique sight as the back end of your goliath friend suddenly gives birth to  two halfelves its very ace ventura 2 however you eventually climb your way angrily up to the  very edge and there is the boulder there and youre about to go right towards it but then stop  and remember what your friends had said and you wait patiently for the pattern of the next  footfall boom  travis punch impact  matt go ahead and roll an attack  travis can i make it reckless oh i /none/ didnt say it  laura but you do extra damage because youre  travis oh yeah siege oh its fine 30  matt yeah all right so roll 1d4 damage  travis okay 1d4 four  matt plus your strength modifier and your rage damage  travis eight 27  matt whoa wait did you double it already  travis no  matt wait so its four plus eight 12  travis and my rage damage is 15 well thats with the axe  matt thats with the axe yeah no thats your overall so your rage damage at this /none/ level is  four because you just went up a level so its 12 plus four so its 16 so you do 32 points of  bludgeoning damage with a single punch to this rock with one hit the entire boulder shifts and  cracks and you watch as part of it breaks away and you see a brief glimmer of a dull light from  the opposite side as it rests back into place heavily damaged  taliesin singing wait for it to go again and bump bump bump  matt you wait for the next footfall of the /none/ titan impact you feel the impact and the shake do  you want to go for another punch  travis do i hit it now  sam taliesin and laura yes  matt roll another attack  travis oh thats even better 33  matt easily enough go ahead and roll another d4  travis two plus eight ten plus  matt four for rage damage  travis 14  matt all right and so with that your fist slams into the boulder a second time it explodes and  shatters into hundreds of crumbled pieces of rock and stone /none/ goes firing across the distance of this  tunnel now revealing a little bit of flickering firelight as youre sitting there seething with  anger and your muscles and veins bulging with each breath  travis im so swole right now  matt yeah you can see above you this entranceway opens up into a fivefoot wide  tenfoot tall hallway that goes to the right and left as you emerge it goes a little bit to the  right and front and then to the back and behind you that direction  travis hey guys its a z  /none/ laura what do you see  travis let me find out so i wiggle up a little more  marisha so you know the first and last letter of the alphabet dont worry about it  matt so you squeeze out of the small entrance way and step up into it you can see now a  wellconstructed hallway you can see there are stone slabs that are carved the patterns and the  angular architecture of this hall as it comes up into a trapezoid position the hall comes in a  bit and the hallway rooftop is a /none/ flat even surface this is apparently a hall of dwarven make  and seems to be a continuation of some sort of structure or pathway of thomara  taliesin let the twins take a look i think it would be safe  travis its a wellconstructed hallway of dwarvish make groans  laura we sneak under his legs again to like see whats going on  matt you guys all eventually make your way up into this hallway now it is still a five  footwide hallway so youre still here in singlefile progression one way or the other  /none/ liam twins are already at the top looking for problems  matt right so you guys would be able to because its a tenfoottall tunnel you guys would be  able to occupy a space above another party member if you were both on the broom  laura oh should we be on the broom no you should be off the broom because you might check  for traps ill check for traps along the wall and ceiling and hes going to check for traps  liam ill take the lower half thats called advantage  matt so go ahead /dung/ and make and investigation check  laura both of us or just him with advantage  matt both of you separately because youre investigating different elements of the hallway  liam 18 for me  laura investigation natural fucking 20  matt as you guys glance up and focus on the surrounding location the hallway behind you goes  for about 30 or so feet before it looks like a cave in it looks like a mass of fully collapsed  broken stone you can see bits of the hallway slabs that originally held up that part are  collapsed /dung/ inward and broken left scattered across the ground the other direction you go continues  on and opens into a dark chamber about 60 feet ahead of you  laura we should go toward the cave in dont you think  matt there are small builtin sconces that are magically perpetually burning firelight  laura does this seem like theres any traps that could be set off as we walk towards the  matt you do not notice anything as you were investigating specifically for that  taliesin check the sconces see if they trigger something  laura ill look /none/ at the sconces  liam i will look at the sconces  laura ill look at them better  matt i included that as your perception for traps above you did not notice anything that would be  considered a trap  laura you guys theres no traps we should head towards this darkened room  marisha save a life check a sconce  liam im going to creep about 40 feet down the hall and continue that search  matt about 20 feet before this darkened chamber is there before you as you get to the edge you  /dung/ can see a little bit the very inside of this chamber you can see a darkened brazier its your  mind playing tricks on you you thought you heard a raven  liam every day when im on the crapper matt everywhere  matt a cold metallic brazier in the middle of the room and thats as far as you can see into the  chamber before the edge of your visual range goes dark  taliesin people dont install those unless theres something awful that needs to be done  marisha do we have any idea how far weve /none/ climbed  matt you can make a nature check  liam and do i need to make a extra roll to look for traps around this brazier  matt if you want to enter the chamber you can youre too far away  marisha hey natural 20 thats a gil 20  matt as you take a moment and think back to how far youve traveled pathwise and inclines and  where you entered this titan and to where the city of thar amphala is placed upon its torso you  gather youre close to halfway through its torso if /none/ not a little beyond it  marshia if not a little beyond  sam hes big  marisha okay all right nipple level  matt sternum  marisha the heartburn region a little acid reflux  liam we are the acid reflux  marisha he has acid resistance against reflux  liam jesus christ whoever that is  matt you scoot up to the edge  liam i dont want to go further than roughly 60 feet away from my sister  matt right which will put you right at the entryway to this chamber  liam yeah so i /none/ will peep in from here  laura i follow up and stand next to him did you want to go in  liam i did  laura feel free  matt so the marching order is the same we got the twins up the front  taliesin yeah i like this marching order  liam let this shit blow up in my face so everybody hang back for a second and im going to  pitter patter in and look around the sconce the room  laura i think i was more stealthy than you a moment ago so are /dung/ you sure you want to be in  front of me  liam i love you anyway here i go  taliesin hes better at blowing up than you are dear  travis yeah his heart beats once a century so let him go  liam slower than this titans footfalls  matt all right so as you enter the chamber its a small about 20foot radius squareshaped dark  iron chamber with rounded corners so its about 40 feet wide from side to side 20 feet from the  center where the brazier is and the corners are slightly /none/ curved it doesnt come to a straight  hard corner there is no exit door currently visible the chamber comes to an end the room  looks mostly bare aside from an eightfoottall fivefootwide mirror coated in dust framed in  intricate gold and brass that sits across the chamber on the opposite side  of where you entered  liam mirror in brass so its an iron room right  matt iron room with a brass edge around this eightfoot tall fivefoot wide mirror you can  tell its a mirror from this side what little bit of light /dung/ there is behind you you can see your  silhouette waving mirrored in the mirror  liam so doorway brazier mirror  matt mirror and then the rest of the chamber seems fairly empty  laura and the brazier is complete dark  matt yeah  laura its cold  taliesin oh no  laura this is not good  liam look at his fake innocent face  sam i think its just a vanity  liam going to check for traps from right here to start all right thats totally fine thats a  jellyfish that is a 17 /none/  matt you begin to glance around the chamber best you can to take in the scenery you notice small  gold piecesized buttons or pressure knobs set in the rounded corners of the chamber on the mirror  side ones embedded within the upper left and right corners and within the lower  left and right corners  sam pressure knobs  matt theyre like little buttons that are gold piecesized that are embedded in the upper right  and left corners and the lower left and right corners  travis push them  liam stubby come up here /none/ i have a real bad history with pushing buttons  matt you also notice very thin light piles of black residue or ash scattered in  places across the floor  marisha called it this is a fucking incinerator i knew it this feels like an incinerator no  what hes looking at me nervous laughter  liam sighs so weve got buttons  marisha or lasers  travis incinerator or lasers  marisha laser incinerator duh  travis that was a great jump for me and my character  liam if something stupid is going to happen here i /none/ dont want it to be on me alone for once so  weve got an unlit brazier theres mirror over there and buttons yeah  laura maybe the mirror is a door  liam i thought that as well  laura should we try to walk through it  taliesin maybe a second interrogation room and theres another room behind it maybe  liam can we get your hub up here please  taliesin i am up here im right here  liam jesus  laura hi darling i dont know why he didnt hear you you used to be /none/ so good at that is the  mirror leaning or is it on the wall  matt its on the wall  marisha is it curved no the whole room isnt curved its a square room  matt its a square room but the corners curve ever so slightly so theres no direct corner and  in those curved corners on the side that the mirrors on so the far side from you theres  these little buttons in the upper right and left corner and the lower left and right  laura can i reach down and touch the /none/ iron on the ground the floor does it feel warm  matt mm its cold  liam i catch her wrist just a second you two do the thinking all right and i take  a step into the room  matt okay  liam what do i do  laura go see if you can walk through the mirror  taliesin tap the mirror  travis light the brazier  laura weve done that before and we all exploded  travis yeah but its vax  marisha wait before we do that can i reach some of the ashy /none/ stuff  matt if you enter the chamber to yeah  marisha hand me some ash ill test it  liam i scoop some ash lady of the grey hunt here i scoop up some ash and  i pour it into her hands  marisha okay i do a nature check what does this ash feel like its made out of  sam human bones  marisha yeah thats what im wondering groans  taliesin wow  laura no what is it groans  travis is it for real you are lying  liam look at that face you /none/ are not lying  marisha oh man thats a one thanks gil i blame gil for his natural 20 in the balance  of the universe  matt its light ash youre not sure what the basis of what may have burned here you see more  of it gathered near where the brazier is  taliesin is it in piles that would be about humanamount of ash  matt make an investigation check  taliesin all right ill gil this one yeah natural 20 thatll do  sam only ones and 20s tonight  liam thats it yeah just /none/ quarters heads up heads down  matt more of it seems to be around the base of the brazier but you do see there are thicker  traces at different places throughout the chamber  taliesin its organic ash  matt youve dealt with different types of ash the carbon appears to have been organicbased at  some point  liam i pull off my belt and say hello simon wake him up  matt okay slithering  liam hi gosh its been a while  laura simon go through the mirror  liam thats right go check out the /none/ mirror simon all right off you go  travis are we still in the room  laura no nobodys in the room hes the only one in the room  matt slithering scoots over and heads up to the mirror and presses up against it  liam i dart back one step out of the room as it happens  matt the snake trying to push up against the wall but half of its body sliding against the mirror  before it eventually scoots off and lands it tries again pushing against the mirror and then  eventually sliding  /none/ taliesin i hate to say this but tap the button  liam thats on the list simon buddy crawl up the brazier wrap around it go up to the top  matt the snake slithers around and makes its way its a crossmetal cage there are inch wide metal  bars that all curl up like a basket and then there are bars that cross around it to hold the shape  it looks like there are some longburned blackened pieces of wood that have been left for a  long time so simon curls up into the brazier and /none/ curls up around the metal comes around the top of  the outer rim of it rests there  liam theres two buttons low down oh man the nostalgia here all right buddy i take two steps  back away from the door buddy buds will you go push those low buttons in the room  matt which one  liam theres two right  matt theres four on the opposite side  liam theres two high up and i dont think he can reach the high because he doesnt stick to  walls get the one over here on /none/ the left first  laura what if we all have to push every button at the same time  liam thats true that could be  matt simon slithering moves over  liam i lean over to percy i say science  matt hits the button click right on the entrance of where you are in the chamber slams  closed iron metal now closes off that entranceway  taliesin im going to touch the door  sam and say goodbye  taliesin simon we barely knew him is it warm  matt it is beginning to get warm  /none/ taliesin its an oven im looking for some sort some sort of cancel mechanism somewhere on  the outside of the door  matt make an investigation check  sam is vax in the room  liam no i took two steps back from the door  laura no nobodys in the room  taliesin lets say that investigation was somewhere around a seven  laughter  matt its pretty solid at this point the walls that lean in towards the ceiling there it is a  perfect solid iron slab that has closed off at the entrance  travis /none/ no problem ill get it down  laura no  liam wait simon is technically a magical item so i dont think he would be harmed by anything  going on in there so why dont we give it five minutes  marisha and maybe itll open again  liam yeah  travis is there anything going on in the tunnel on the outside of this door where we are  laura coming up from behind us  matt make a perception check  travis temperature check anything like that natural 20  taliesin we have been gone so long /dung/  matt gone for two weeks and you guys cant find middle math its only extremes  liam yeah weve had blue balls for two weeks and its all coming out now  matt so as you guys glance back in the shadow of the tunnel behind you nothing seems to be  catching your eye its still dark about two minutes in what was once dark metal is now giving  a slight orangish hue you can feel the heat emanating from it  travis theres no ash on the floor in the hallway that we are in right /none/ now right  matt id say because of your perception check as you glance around there does  not appear to be any ash  travis i dont want that door to fucking open all of a sudden  matt about five minutes go by as you guys are waiting eventually the iron wall begins to  descend the dull orangish glow of it is still there as it opens a wave of heated air emerges  from the chamber you all have to immediately close your eyes some of you instinctually begin  to step further back into the /none/ hallway on the inside of the room you can see the black iron  interior of the chamber is also that same orangish glow the mirror is unscathed you all step back  and watch and a few minutes pass as it slowly begins to cool off the metal slowly darkening  youre too far away to look you make a perception check to try and glance in  laura cant you call to him  liam simon come here buddy  matt theres no response  liam gasps hes a magical item oh but he could have turned back /none/ into a belt  taliesin whats he going to say if you call to him was he going to say something  liam he would come to me percy jeepers creepers perception check 29  matt you glance past where the button was that it hit you see a limp belt left on the ground  liam okay ill get that in a minute  laura when you go pick him up and put him back on your fucking waist  matt technically since simons taken enough damage to revert to the belt form simon cannot  turn back into /none/ a snake for the day  laura how about that unseen servant  liam im thinking having no knowledge of magic that we either want to somehow push all four of  these buttons at once as my sister said or light this brazier or both  laura what about the brazier is it cold does it look like its hot  sam the braziers the source of the furnace i assume  travis are there still charred wooden pieces in the middle of it  matt the pieces are still there but its black carbon theres nothing in there /none/ that could burn  whatevers been in there has been heated so much to the point  travis its not the source of the flame not for that much heat  marisha if i was the person who designed this why would i put a failsafe in here  liam a way to get through that only the creator would know how to use  marisha i feel like theres got to be another entrance because we can see another room right  laura theres no other room its a mirror oh keyleth thats our reflection  marisha no i /none/ know that but a lot of things have reflections  liam listen all of you or i are going to be dead very soon are you sure you want to be that  sarcastic right now  marisha i go up to the mirror and check it out its cooled off enough right  matt well no if you guys want to take a few minutes you can wait until it  cools off if you want to  taliesin why dont we try pushing all four buttons at once  sam wait before we do that im going to /none/ enter the room and look around at  the walls and the ceiling  matt okay i take it you wait until it cools off it takes about ten minutes or so for it to fully  cool off to the point where its comfortable  sam im looking for markings indications of instructions arrows any hidden words  matt make an investigation check  travis look for dwarvish im aces with that  sam ooh a lot 29  taliesin hes coming up with some bullshit  matt okay because the room is not fully cooled off its still /none/ warm in there somewhat you  glance through the ceiling and the walls all appear to be solid iron and theres a layer of  dust across a lot of it a bit of ash from whatever previously may have been incinerated in  here long ago as you look from the opposite side of the room into the reflection of the mirror you  see a very faint orangish glow in the reflection it looks like in the upper corner and the lower  corner of the opposite side of the mirror as youre glancing off across to the /none/ other side as  you look over to the wall of the room youre in theres no glow  sam wait so the wall that we came in through  matt lets say you enter the chamber and you move to the corner immediately to your right you look  in the mirror at an angle youre now seeing the reflection of the corner opposite to you right  looking in that reflection you can see this very faint orange glow in the upper and lower corner  but you glance over to the physical corner across from you and /none/ its not there  laura what do your gnomish eyes see scanlan  sam i think theres magical buttons in here and we need to find them so im going to look in the  mirror i go to the opposite corner and do the same thing  matt as you have this conversation and look back those two glowing sigils are gone  sam even in the mirror  matt even in the mirror what you saw earlier is now gone  travis but theyre revealed by heat  marisha where were they  sam they were upper and /none/ lower corner yeah  marisha i walk over and i heat them with my heat hands  matt okay so you take your hands and you put them up near there as you put your hands on the  wall nothing seems to happen as you glance through the reflection where she has her hands  that symbol seems to be appearing again  laura what is the symbol of  sam its so far i dont know can i see it  matt it looks to be a simple triangular symbol marked in a circle make an arcana check /none/  sam oh yeah 14 plus six thats 20  matt its the most basic of arcane marks its a variation on a spell that basically is a mark that  a certain enchanter or somebody places to mark as their own however this is meant to be a basic  marker a visual draw theres no language behind it its just an indicator  sam keyleth do that same thing to the lower one same marking  matt as you head down there the one above begins to slowly fade as her hands go there the symbol  appears /none/ below  sam same symbol lets do that to the other walls and see if we can find other ones  matt as you guys reverse opposite sides you go to the other corners the ones that were  immediately toward the entrance of where you walked in sure enough two more symbols  mirroring where the buttons are on the far side corners  sam so we push those but theres a hidden button in there  travis when youre a big fire the walking thing  marisha a fire elemental  travis sure do you take damage from /none/ fire so you should be in here  laura you should go in there see if you can disengage the trap  liam so you are impervious to being set on fire or burned  marisha well when im a fire elemental  laura can you do that  marisha can i do it right now yeah i just took a short rest so yes i can do that  travis we also have an unseen servant  sam so were going to need four people  marisha so whats the end goal what am i doing  liam press /none/ all four buttons at once although weve got at least three sharpshooters  sam not the buttons that we can see what are these symbols here i think theyre buttons as well  travis it might be a depression on the wall or something  marisha but what if the buttons are correlated with the symbols  taliesin lets try pushing all four buttons  travis the regular buttons or the magic ones  liam please stand by  laura i want to go look at where the symbol is and see if its a fucking button  marisha yeah /none/ if i touch the symbol theres nothing there right  sam was there anything there  matt you put your hand on there nothing the wall doesnt move  marisha its just a wall  travis no depression no toggle  matt make an investigation check  travis ive got this you guys oh minus two 17  matt 17 grog as you step up and glare down at the place where keyleth had placed her palm you  get frustrated and sighs heavily as you exhale it looks like a bit of soot and ash that had been  /none/ slowly drifting in and filling this space flutters away you can see two lines parallel to each  other about an inch tall  travis fifth element anyone oh look breath of grog reveals all look behold two lines  laura what did you do  travis i breathed on the wall  sam what do they do what do these lines do  marisha i do a quick gust cantrip  matt across the parallel lines all right as the wind blows across it a lot more of the soot and  the ash blows around the area it /none/ creates an open space where it pushes out to the edges and darkens  areas of the floor and the vicinity around keyleth that edge of that corner where you blew  the gust cantrip that grog had unfurled is now clear the iron revealed nothing beyond the two  laura i fly up on my broom and do it to the symbol up on the corner and go blowing  matt okay so up there you blow on that one and it looks like  marisha hang on ive got a paper ready  liam how many people at /none/ home do you think have figured this out already  laura we already figured it out  sam wait you guys are blowing on the arcane symbols  laura yeah to clear them out  travis if youre looking at the door we came in grog blew on the lower right  sam and thats two lines boom  matt that would be lower right  travis two vertical lines  matt correct  laura im in the corner above grog  matt that would be upper right  taliesin im going to do bottom left  matt all right /none/ you blow and you watch as the dust reveals its two more lines  laura two lines shit i thought it was going to be another  taliesin bottom left getting out a hanky and blows  liam did you use your ascot  taliesin yes of course thats what its there for the back of it  laura the one clean spot left on it  matt that one has four parallel lines  laura ooh ill go into the corner above percy there was a reflection there too right  sam blow laura blow  laura blows i /none/ looked straight at the camera as i did it it was really awkward  matt all right that one has a single line  sam wait so weve got one two two four  laura is there one with three lines or are there any more areas we saw a reflection  travis what about above the door it is opposite of the mirror right if ones a door and the  other ones a door  laura okay ill blow above the door  liam and im going to start blowing around the mirror  laura we all walk /none/ around going raspberries  travis constitution check to see who passes out first  matt what was that  taliesin does the mirror have a fancy frame  matt its not extremely intricate but it looks like theres a brass or bronze frame around it  taliesin are any of these symbols mirrored in the frame itself is there a mirror of any of these  symbols in the frame  matt as you look in the actual frame itself you dont see anything that matches the symbols  laura what if these are numbers and the order you have /none/ to push the buttons  sam except we have two twos and no three  laura i know one two four  taliesin no because you have to hit one and then you have to hit the two together  sam and then why not three okay all right can we do a sweep for more  travis can i clear off the door area that we walked through  matt so grog you go through rapid blowing blowing around okay make an investigation check  marisha i take my mantle and start doing a  matt you clear that /none/ archway very well around the door you do reveal dwarven runes on the upper  right corner upper left corner lower right and lower left corner of the doorframe  travis i only know dwarven writing i dont know runes  matt well the runes are part of the dwarven language  travis the runes are part of the dwarven language so i know them  laura pike goes over and she helps you  travis help me pike yeah i would like to decipher what these symbols mean  laura if you lift me up i could see the /none/ ones above the door  liam yeah the last time i wanted you to do it on your own but i think were pressed for time  travis i hold her up to the upper left corner of the doorway  matt okay so turning around upper left corner okay that one is the dwarven rune that represents  the number three  travis three all right now to the upper righthand corner  matt that is the number one  travis okay i put her on the ground and i say okay look at the lower righthand corner  /none/ matt so lower righthand corner would be a two  travis and now the lower lefthand corner  matt a four  laura oh yeah we know thats the amount of times you have to push the button  taliesin so oneone twotwotwotwo three fourfour  sam possibly  laura wait i think we reversed it  liam how long does your unseen servant last  sam not too long  liam how long an hour ten minutes  sam ill look in my memory one hour but i have to be close to it how big is this room /none/  matt its a 20foot radius from the center of the brazier so its 40 feet on each side  taliesin is our physicality of this map correct if we show you this  liam well i have this jar its an oil of etherealness you could potentially be standing in  here but not be in here lasts an hour though same time gap as your friend you could stand in  here and not be in here  sam from the doorway to the mirror is it less than 60 feet  matt yes  sam oh then /none/ i can be out of the door  am i right with what i wrote down there  matt all right so this is the facing from the inside  sam yeah from the brazier frasier crane looking at the door that we came in right  matt im going to have to draw you one i think you guys got confused on that one  laura i think me and travis got it right  sam i think matt youre wrong  travis i have the same thing as laura  liam im pretty sure its up up down /none/ down left right left right a b a b  laura i hope we passed the test  matt okay  laura did we get it right  matt there thats what you get sorry im limited in my reach right now  marisha i love that we all did something similar but all wrote something different were like  numbers somewhere  matt yep almost almost  marisha did you help us or are you just saying almost  matt im saying looking back and seeing where the numbers lie and the runes in there you have  the /none/ correct configuration  laura victorious laughter  marisha i think this is right i think you have this i think i have the right part of this and  you have the right part of this  laura well copy it and you can see what the fuck is correct  travis yes  laura no this is wrong im just going to draw it counting  sam guys shadow of war its a great game by i dont know who makes it warner brothers  laura okay so now we know the order to push the buttons and the /none/ amount of times to push the  buttons  sam yes so now weve just got to do it  travis should we check around the mirror frame to see if theres anything to dust off the mirror frame  taliesin i gave it a little bit of a rub  marisha im going to go up and go taptaptap on the mirror  matt okay it taps  travis can i wipe off the edges around the frame and see if theres anything around the frame of  the mirror since i seem to be so good at this /none/  matt make an investigation check  travis three  matt three you smear a bit of ash but eventually get some semblance of shine through  nothing catches your eye  travis its clear we found everything there is to find  marisha grog draws boobs on himself in the reflection out of the ash  sam all right should we leave the room and have mr invisible start tapping buttons all right  well do that  laura we step just outside the door again and let his invisible servant push buttons  liam singing scanlan man scanlan /none/ man does whatever a scanlan can makes a guy pushes  buttons scanlan man im out  taliesin look out  liam marisha and taliesin singing here comes the scanlan man  sam would a person who cannot fly be able to touch the top buttons  matt nope  sam shit  travis well theres no saying that it will activate if we do it correctly  liam also what about shooting the button or firing an arrow at a button  laura yeah but the buttons are on this side  taliesin how high up are the buttons /none/  matt the buttons the top are about ten feet up  taliesin so if he had something that was if he had a mop basically he could probably tap it  laura the buttons are on the side of the mirror so we could shoot arrows at them  taliesin but only if were in there and then we dont need an unseen servant to do it  sam want to give him a pole or something  taliesin lets give him a stick  sam do we have a stick in the bag  travis i have a /none/ lance  taliesin yeah he has a lance  travis its almost broken  taliesin my god it will finally be useful one last time  liam we do have three trammels  taliesin no we are not disengaging a smoke alarm with a fucking trammel there is a limit  travis you have a slightly splintered lance  laura okay lets hit buttons lets do it lets get through this room  taliesin lets explain to the unseen servant what hes supposed to do  sam matt can he hold a lance or is that violating some hes not /none/ allowed to hold  weapons  matt he can hold them he cant attack he cannot be a combatant it can hold things for you  liam hes like a kids in the hall character  matt kind of yeah youre not wrong  sam i conjure an unseen servant whom i will name simon two  taliesin electric boogaloo  liam not cool man not cool  matt all right theres this brief shimmer and you watch as a bit of ash displaces on the ground  where two footfalls landing noises  sam all right simon two take /none/ this lance were going to go tell you what buttons to press over  there good speed good speed  laughter  sam godspell youll be fine hope you dont like burning alive so you tell me what to tell him  because i dont have the paper upper left upper right what do we start with  marisha its this tell him to do this  laura the reflection of that  sam okay so two upper right two pokes oh wait  laura so the upper left corner from where were looking  sam yes were going to /none/ go mirror image of this so project that across the room  matt okay  sam oh that was the mistake  matt okay so pressing the upper left twice  sam yes mirror image of this so upper left lets try that  matt heads over holding the lance you watch the lance wobble and it misses a couple times  clicking hits the button and it clicks inward the lance is pulled back and the button presses  back out outward into its position  sam any door  matt no door  laura well know if we /none/ push it again then we did it the wrong order  matt second time clicking pulls off the button depresses  taliesin all right keep going  sam so below it two presses  laura in the corner bottom corner  sam just like your name simon two  matt clicking  sam okay opposite corner up one press  laura upper righthand corner  matt clicking  sam and then below that bottom corner four presses  matt clicking  laughter  matt the fourth one hits theres a moment of pause and the mirror shimmers faintly you watch /none/  as almost like a stone thrown into the middle of a still pond begins to ripple from the center and as  it ripples each ripple seems to fade until eventually the fivefootwide mirror is now an  oval portal that leads to darkness behind it  laura lets go in  marisha i told you there was a room behind the mirror  travis yeah lets go hurry we dont know how long it will stay open for  sam simon two is coming with us  matt okay you hear the faint footfalls of sound behind and /none/ trinket takes a moment to try and  squeeze through this small entranceway trinket had a hard enough time getting through the  incline moans into the necklace you make your way through the opposite side and as you all step  through the portal remains open for at least a moment  laura hey we did it guys  sam and travis we beat a door  marisha guys it took 111 episodes but we bested a door  liam the last episode of the third campaign will be a door that we do not open  matt so /none/ the darkness you step through leads into a tenfootwide hallway of similar dwarven stone  same slightly angled hallways about ten feet tall or so about five or six foot wide you get a few  steps in and about 20 or 30 seconds after you guys make your way in the mirror portal behind closes up  liam can we see  marisha can you see through it  matt through the mirror  liam i meant where we are are we in pitch black  matt youre in pitch black but you guys with darkvision can see there /none/ is a staircase not too  far maybe ten feet from where you stand into this next hallway  travis iron stairs stone stairs  matt stone stairs  liam ive got a dagger out  matt all right lights up briefly and you get a little bit of a vision beyond that and its  gradual stone steps theyre not too wide theyre made for dwarven gait so there are many steps  that are relatively shallow  travis these are dwarven steps that are relatively shallow  sam we can see it grog  liam pike says thats /none/ actually right  laura is there any traps  matt youre welcome to search for traps  liam and im going to scoot 40 feet up the stairs and look as i go for traps one im taking it  but im still going and looking for traps  matt you do have reliable talent dont forget  liam does that oversee ones because ive been counting ones as ones for a long time  matt the reliable talent as a rogue specifically says any roll lower than a ten you take as a ten  sam any roll  /none/ matt well not any roll any ability check he has to make  liam okay well we wrongly assumed that ones and 20s were king but no  laura so he rolled way better than me because i rolled a ten  liam thats an 18 my one is an 18 now  matt yeah because thats one of the cool things about rogues you guys make your way up about 45  50 or so feet up the stairway you keeping an eye out no traps nothing catches your eye as iffy or  strange and the stairs now /dung/ switch back into another set its a small landing and then it  continues upward  liam okay but im only going to go 40 feet in advance thats like ten fucked rolls of mine from  the past 30 games anyway i love it  marisha so its a big 180 going right up  matt yeah its a switchback the staircase ascends then theres a landing and it continues  upward and around  laura do we hear anything  matt make a perception check  taliesin ill join in that perception  matt so youre joining them /none/ up the staircase  taliesin im behind you know the standard  matt all right so you guys are keeping up  marisha did you fuck the roll too oh what the fuck  taliesin i got a 25  matt seriously welcome back after two weeks and people just cannot wow  liam but do you remember when we were at home and wed go six weeks without playing and wed spend  45 minutes trying to remember what we did how the rules worked what our names were who you were  taliesin vex is right  travis /none/ 25 you said  taliesin 25  matt 25 okay its hard to discern what shifting in the distance is not the rumbling from the  everoccasional titan footfalls but nothing seems to catch your attention occasionally you hear  dislodged rocks and stones clacking across the stone floor and the steps and every now and then  you catch a stone or two fall past and eventually come to rest either near or below you you  continue up the switchback stairs and lead into a third switchback that continues upward  liam 40 feet in advance  marisha /none/ we are following behind  laura are you looking for traps as you go brother  liam i am that is an 18 anyway  marisha i still have my hands guiding percy our blind human  matt leading the old man forward  taliesin old man voice wheres steven  marisha laughs wheres steven  matt you do not find any other traps theres no other issues that worry you upon this climb you  do eventually come to the top of the third switchback stairway and it leads you into a slight  curved cavern the stairs stop /none/ and it leads into a continuation of the dwarflike hallway structure  that you had below but it is curving around now in sections i would say as opposed to a gradual  curve the design in the structure here has a very rigid geometric shape so the curvature is in  sections  liam yeah i appreciate it as i go and i look for traps  matt all right go for it  liam love it thats an 18  matt okay coming around the edge no traps no plates nothing catches your attention however  this tunnel /town/ comes to an end and it opens up into a larger crevasse than the one that you previously  saw that held a number of city buildings of the remains of thomara it looks to be about 100 to  120 feet tall you assume from the bits of the stalactites that you can see barely reaching the  edge of your visual range very faint bit of light here bioluminescent fungus in a dull orangish  color that dots the edges of this interior chamber  liam and is it like where i killed that motherfucker they were built /town/ into the cliff face right  matt yes this one is larger than the one you were in before and you can see just beyond your  visual range a number of these buildings partially crumbled in some places some still  standing obstinately against the evershifting interior of the titans form the chamber curling  upward as the ceiling crawls higher and higher just beyond your visual range and you can faintly  see the images of dozens of thin bridges that weave over themselves across different levels up  into the higher portion  liam i want to /none/ confirm an intuition and use my last divine sense and feel undead  matt okay whats the range on that one  liam 60 feet  matt 60 feet you do not sense any undead within the 60foot range  marisha i think were in the lungs i think were in its chest cavity  liam speaking into the earrings theyre all behind me i think were in a more populous place  with the undead cannibals know what i mean theres a very large cavern in here and a lot of room  taliesin id be grateful if anyone /none/ got a sample of that bioluminescent fungus  marisha i can get that im interested  laura do you want me to fly up and get some  liam were on a schedule here  marisha well if its on the way we have to go that way  laura we have to go up right does it look like theres openings in the ceiling  matt well currently youre the only one whos stepped into this entrance to look up the rest of  you are now exiting into the chamber  liam ill wait obviously nothings going to /town/ explode on my friends so they catch up with me  matt okay so theyre all behind you now where this entrance is and as you look past it this  hallway that youre entering it looks like there was a doorway here there was some sort of hinge  on the edge that held a door that had since been broken or toppled forward you can see pieces of  the door that once held this entranceway and a number of the buildings immediately to the right  and left thats where you stand what do you want to /none/ do  laura does it look like theres any footprints coming in and out of the doorway that we came from  matt make an investigation check  travis can i look for a doorknob or a keyhole  liam everything we were told is that this place is full of undead cannibals  laura 23  matt not in a long time  travis is there shattered remnants of the door  matt yeah you see a couple of shards here and there  travis any doorknob or a keyhole thats on the ground or anything  matt make /none/ an investigation check lot of investigation checks today  travis two  matt you scramble about and find a couple of pieces that might be but no its just more stone  marisha can i see any stairs carved in the side in the walls trying to head up to this is that  what you just checked  laura no thats what i was about to look for too  liam is there any movement because theres bioluminescent shit on the walls in here so  theres a little bit of light right yeah 26  matt 26 as /none/ you glance about once again your vision because there is very little light in here  and the very very faint bits of fungus in the distance that give you a sense of the shape of  this entire chamber there isnt enough light for you to make out any shape beyond the exterior of  your visual range so you cant really tell  liam a second thing i want to look for is what other exits from this gigantic cavern ways  through up yeah you looked but i didnt look  matt let me finish what i /none/ was saying first  travis roll roll again  matt but based on the size of this chamber and the bits of what small elements of structures that  you can see of the architecture within this definitely appears to be more of the heart of the  city of thomara when it was once at its ancient height you can see at the very edge of your  visual range a cracked central fountain that is empty and dry and you see just beyond your  range the exterior of a large templelike building that rises out of the /none/ ability to see any  more of its height and structure  taliesin temple  matt but like i said you guys are still standing at the entrance to this cavern  marisha what about the temple why  sam want to fly through here can we fly  liam i dont think we want to stay here  sam i know thats why we just fly through  liam find another exit yeah but where  travis id like to see the temple if i can  sam what are you talking about  travis well look all right /none/ my gloves  laura keep your voice down  travis whispering my gloves come from the heart of a ruined primordial titan so if maybe they  harvested pieces of my gloves and its in a temple i dont know you smart people could do  something with that  liam right whats your plan you expect us to come up with a plan to explain why your gloves are  connected to that temple and youre going to get what a mighty morphin power ranger bonus for doing so  travis yes  marisha are your titanstone knuckles exalted /none/ yet  travis yep theyre just buzzing  liam yeah are they still dildoing on your fingers  marisha are they buzzing more  travis are they humming more  matt doesnt appear to have changed  travis nope just humming  marisha step two steps closer  travis two steps closer to the temple  marisha do they appear to be buzzing more  travis are they appearing buzzing more  matt make a perception check  travis ooh 19  matt not bad nope  taliesin is the temple on the way does it make sense to cross /none/ through the city or does it make  sense to fly up  liam were moving towards vasselheim now im negative on our chances of dealing with this  before vasselheim but thats the goal right  taliesin weve got some time and i feel like this city is an opportunity to find some more  advantages  travis we are also looking for the sword of kas whats if its in the temple  sam why would vecna keep the thing that could kill vecna near vecna  liam im pulling percy aside i hear you but this is /none/ a city that has existed here for a long  time vecna didnt create this city vecna doesnt own these people this is a fucking  mountain that existed and now theyre going for a ride what do these people have to do with vecna  taliesin its not a city that just existed  liam no  taliesin this is a giant primordial beast that people inhabited god only knows what existed in here  marisha yeah but as weve already seen from the other tomb its already been heavily heavily  plundered  liam and vecnas just a /none/ user this place was just sitting there he lifted it up and took it away  these assholes dont have anything to do with  travis why did he choose this  marisha how far away is the temple do we know can we football range guess it  matt id say because you guys have darkvision of 60 feet  taliesin if gods really understood how this world worked this would not be happening right now  matt its at about the 50 55 foot areas where the wall begins then it vanishes beyond that  liam percy this /none/ shitbird has appeared like three times wherever we were  laura well hes not going to be able to do that right now because ive got a fucking ring  taliesin he doesnt necessarily know this place as well as  marisha hang on how long have we been in here versus how far have we been from vasselheim  because we are on a time crunch  travis 200 miles away once we entered is how far away we are from vasselheim 200 miles with steps of  taliesin what was the average land speed of a laden undead /none/  matt youve been within the titan for id say roughly three and a half hours maybe  liam yeah hes 110 miles out from vasselheim at this point  travis we have time to check the temple  sam all right lets swoop in and swoop out  marisha super fucking fast  taliesin im not even saying look in it lets take a look at what it  laura did i see any stairs  matt you do not see any staircases within a 60foot radius of where youre standing  taliesin we might be harder to spot /none/ if we stay on the ground for now anyway  marisha i just want to say we gave you guys the other temple in which you found your stupid  waistband but we got really fucked up from it everything has a consequence and a price and shit  nothing is free  laura im going to cast pass without a fucking trace its my last pass without a trace but im afraid  travis no dont do it  laura what if we bring out an entire fucking city of undead dwarves upon us  marisha let me do /none/ it i have pass without a trace and one more 2ndlevel spell left ill do it  save yours  liam im also going to put something on the table here were trying to save vasselheim but were  also trying to save the world we might not be able to do this without recharging before vasselheim  taliesin im aware  sam you want to go to sleep in this undead city  liam no but were trying to save the world not just a city  sam so sacrificing vasselheim so that we can feel better about a /none/ fight  liam what if we lose the fight scanlan then who fucking cares vasselheim is gone westruun is  gone kaylie is gone everythings fucking gone if we fuck this up  sam well lets stay on the path and see how long it takes  marisha how about this hold wait we still dont know how to get up there right  sam is that purple eyeliner  marisha yeah do you like it thank you its a little metallic thank you i bought it while i  was waiting for  travis and laura oh my god /none/  marisha okay i hate to say

the stairs oh you asshole stop it  laughter  laura he was really excited about it  matt i was waiting on that  laura oh my god he was so excited about it  sam all right into the temple come on lets just fucking go to the fucking /none/ temple  matt i was like you guys literally had this conversation an hour ago but okay  taliesin whatever we do we cant split the party fastforward noise okay were going to split the party  travis sam saved our asses  taliesin that was cabin in the woods shit  liam 40 feet in advance vax walks ahead of the group hating himself here we go  matt go for it what are you doing youre checking for traps  liam im checking for enemies hiding  matt so as you push forward  laura were stealthed were /none/ pass without a traced  matt okay then roll some stealth guys  laura she pass without a traced us  matt right then roll some stealth  sam oh were all rolling stealth  liam 34  sam 25  taliesin 26  marisha 26  laura 39  travis natural one  marisha are you serious  sam hes so excited about that temple  laura natural 20 for pike oh wait she gets disadvantage  matt she has the boots that make it not at disadvantage  taliesin first time ever  liam but thats a lot /town/ of good  laura so much good for one shitty  matt you begin to push forward past the cracked fountain heading ahead of everyone keeping an  eye out for whats ahead of you the high walls of the templelike structure begin to reveal  themselves standing ominous over the debrisstrewn streets with shattered carts and  bone fragments the bone fragments faintly quaking beneath every footfall of the walking mountain  that you currently are walking through you see longdecomposed dwarvish bodies brutalized beyond  reanimation lying scattered across the broken street paths ahead of you deep grooves /town/ marking  the splintered bone a tangled network of partially ruined catwalks begin to reveal  themselves above you carved from the mountain contains a ghostly image of a multilevel  metropolis long fallen you make a perception check  liam 29  matt 29 you can see as soon as you get to where the fountain is the center of the street ahead of  you dozens of slow shifting creatures moving throughout the streets and rubble of crumbling  structures you can see now many of the undead citizens of the catacombs are now wandering  shaken awake /none/ by the lumbering titan that now carries them within you also see a very faint  blue pulsing glow emanating from one of the windows of the temple  liam can we put the goliath on the carpet so he doesnt kick something or be himself  laura we dont know that he rolled shittily  liam i know that but hes a big blundering mother fucking asshole when he wants to be  travis on the chain literally on the text chain  matt which as youre saying this you hear a clattering and you glance over real fast /none/ and  watch as grog is walking by and the edge of his which weapon do you have attuned right now you  have the blood axe the blood axe hits the edge of a large dwarven statue that had fallen off at a  corner angle and is currently being held by a small barrel and as the axe hits it it shifts  crashing and rolls and comes to a rest for a second with this clattering grinding sound parts  of it chip and break but most of it remains strong and sturdy upon impact at which /none/ point you  see at the edge of your visual range about seven of the wandering creatures go raspy groan and  begin slowly slinking their way in the direction of the noise  sam so a rock just fell  travis a big statue just fell  sam and is in pieces  matt parts of it are broken its still pretty sturdy  taliesin lets try and serpentine around and see if we can trace back  liam and theyre to the right or the left or ahead of us  matt theyre ahead of you  laura /none/ do they look like they saw us  liam go left jenga jenga jenga can we put grog on the carpet now  taliesin yep  marisha were trying to go up right  sam no were trying to go towards the temple  laura towards that pulsing light  liam weve got a little bit of business a little bit of activity ahead of us so we want to curve  to the left  travis all right we move accordingly  matt all right so you guys move along the left and curve around the side as you /none/ begin to move  along the edge you watch as about eight of these mostlyskeletal dwarvish corpses begin to shamble  in the direction of where the noise came from you can see elements of their longmummified skin  pulled tight against elements of the rib cage and the skull bits of chipped teeth now broken  against whatever things its attempted to chew on its long unlife as they move past two of them  glance over in the direction of grog and then all of them shift over in the direction and begin  rushing forward in your /none/ path  liam whats the distance  matt at this point theyre probably about 50 or so feet from where you are  liam oh shit  laura we dont want to make too much noise im going to shoot a couple  travis we could just go straight up  laura theres only eight of them we can take eight undead  liam pickle walks forward and takes a knee and waits with her holy symbol  of sarenrae waiting for them  laura i take two of them by surprise thats autocrit  liam vax does the same /none/ watching his badass sister and pike waits to turn whatevers left of them  laura yeah theyre supersilent arrows  liam so what happens first  matt all right shes preparing for it right  liam yeah shes waiting until she sees them  matt oh well she also has darkvision of 60 feet  liam so shes waiting until theyre within range of her holy abilities  matt whats the radius on that one  liam thats a good question because im a rogue paladin sighs goddamn it  matt thats all right  liam what if i look /none/ in the sorceror rules  matt nope 30 feet  liam 30 feet so shes waiting for the twins to do their work and anything thats left over shes  going to scatter  matt okay all right so as she holds position  laura so its autocrit  matt they know youre there its not a surprise theres as threat and theyre rushing but you do  have advantage on the hits because they dont see you  laura well great thats great 20  matt that definitely hits  laura okay oh the other one superduper hits its /none/ a 19 plus 14  liam 25 31 natural 20  matt okay all right so go ahead and roll damage on those are you shooting two different skeletons  or one each  liam im after my sister she talked before i did  laura ill see how the first arrow hits  matt okay  laura 14 oh i didnt hunters mark whatever 14 15 16 two lightning damage do i add  anything sneak attack  taliesin been a while  laura how do we dd plus ten sneak attack  matt okay so the first skeleton /none/ the arrow hits it and the torso explodes behind with ribs  shattering and scattering across the stonework its body falling and collapsing to the ground  laura i hit another one  matt yes you do  liam oh and we go first so its advantage  laura 14 plus four lightning damage and that is plus eight  travis 26  matt 26 this one right behind it its jaw unhinged slightly its tongue made of this slick  rotting material that dangles through the hole in the bottom of the jaw comes around the corner  and /none/ you watch as part of its head explodes off one side from the secondary arrow taking out what  remains of the center of its skull and the body crumples to the ground two skeletons down  liam sneak attack hits the first time we connect right  matt yeah you dont have to roll damage for that one  laura oh sorry i did sneak attack on the second arrow  matt well you can do sneak attack once per round  laura okay i did eight damage too much  matt it was still enough  laura okay /none/  matt you dont have to roll damage for sneak attack  liam so then that ones gone  matt a third skeleton now is ruined you hit it with the arrow in the middle of the spinal column  and it folds on itself  liam okay so paladin actionaction and my bonus action so thats the first of three the last  ones the one that was a critical hit so the second one goes onto the next whole skeleton its  just an eight  matt okay this one the arrow slides into the side of the /none/ skull and it keeps coming forward  towards grog  liam okay and then the last critical hit which is whisper again because it bamfed back is two  plus eight is ten two and three its not that much its 15 total  matt okay and that one does finish it so thats three skeletons down grog i want to to  individually roll an initiative check for me  travis natural 20 with gils dice  matt so as you guys are watching this happen the other five rush in to close the gap but you are at /none/  the ready and you get to strike before they do  travis nice am i hitting them yeah okay reckless great weapon master 31 for the first one  matt that hits  travis okay cool  matt your minimum damage will kill them so as the first one comes up towards you you swing up  as you slam into it you watch as its bony body blows up against the side of the nearby stone  building and then scrapes to the ground  travis can i use the other strike on another  matt yes you /none/ can  travis reckless great weapon thatll hit thats like 30  taliesin if theres anything left on grog by the end of this ill try to swipe them off with my sword  travis 32  matt all righty so two more detonate on this point so theres three left theyre closing in  on grog does pike want to take her turn  travis we might want to save that turnt undead  laura no i think we should save  liam ive already said it but shes whispering to me to hold shes half of pike right /none/ now  youre half of pike right now  taliesin id like to pop in and see if i could take a couple  matt make an initiative roll  laura dont shoot percy  taliesin im not im going to use my sword  liam pike holds breathing hard looking at them coming on  taliesin 16  matt yeah that beats them by one so yeah as the three remaining ones start charging in towards grog  taliesin im going to run in draw the silvered sword and take some swipes  matt go for it  taliesin /none/ lets take three swipes right out of here  laura pike can use her mace on anything left in that area  taliesin thats one natural 20 one natural 19 do i crit on a 19 with the sword  matt no  taliesin okay never mind and a two but that might be enough because i have a really high  thats a 15 as my lowest to hit does a 15 hit  matt 15 does hit yes  taliesin so the 15 is thats 14 piercing damage to the first one with a silvered sword  matt /none/ okay you rush up and you carve through the first skeleton and it breaks on the ground in  front of you  taliesin number two is 13 points of damage to the second one  matt okay the second one you bring the blade down into the skull and cleave it in half you  watch as part of its skull breaks off to the side and the jaw falls to the ground and the rest  crumbles in place  taliesin i twirl around and take my third wonderful pirouette attack which is 20 points of  damage /none/  matt okay and as the final one lunges forward in a fervent strangely faster than you expect  for a skeletal undead it begins to accelerate towards grog and with that you take the blade  and take the head right off at the neck and it falls and crumples to the ground  marisha so its like 28 days later zombies  travis 28 days later they run  marisha he said that they were fast  matt well the last one it was flavor  marisha just wanted to make sure they werent special  matt okay /none/ as you finish the fray and hold yourself you wait and wait you do not hear or  notice any more advancing undead from that direction  travis okay how about i dont move and somebody with flying ability go to check out that blue  glowy window  taliesin we have to stick together  laura is the glowy window within 60 feet  taliesin no its far  travis when we were at the opening we were 50 to 60 feet away  matt the temple where you guys were at at the time was 50 feet away /none/ from you but you would  have crossed the other side of the hall so now its about 100 feet away from you at this distance  you can see its a round almost cylindrical building colosseumesque and theres a small  square window about every 25 to 30 feet and its big its large but you can see that faint glow  between multiple windows from this distance  travis so should we fly up to that window  taliesin i think itd be safer to stay on the ground level and sneak because if were the air  /none/ they are going to see us  travis lets do it  marisha and we still have pass without a trace so lets go  laura yes we do she cast it  matt all right now that this brief combat has finished those who took place in it which would  be you vax grog and percy have to remake your stealth checks  laura youre like gladly  taliesin yes  laura what about pike because she just knelt down she didnt really fight  matt she stepped out of her stealth she was making herself visible  /none/ laura my natural 20 for pike wasted  taliesin 23  liam we still have pass without trace  marisha yes i didnt do anything  travis 26  marisha keeping that concentration  taliesin and marisha singing concentration concentration  liam youre the doctor keep your patients on the run  laura 30 for pike 29 for me  matt all right you guys begin to slowly make your way along the left wall of this large  cavern  liam 37 by the way  matt good to know as you slowly move through the shadows dodging through /none/ open doorways and through  windows trying the best you can to stay out from the center thoroughfare of this opening you see  more and more of these undead dozens maybe even a hundred have crossed your path at the perimeter  of your visual range and you can see in the catwalks above too with the faint bit of the  orange glow occasionally shapes breaking across the orange this entire cavern is swarming  laura whispering do we still have the thing  sam oh the filter the censer  laura do we have it in the /none/ bag of holding  taliesin we also have the herbs  laura what if we use it what if we use it and it just repels them  taliesin when its time we dont have a lot of it  marisha yeah its a very small amount  liam is it ready to go though  taliesin lets prepare it and when its time  liam is it ready to go though  marisha yeah its dried i spent that time i spent time during the break  taliesin its just burning the herbs though we dont need the censer /none/ just hold it in your hands  liam do we have any sense of where we started in this giant cavern or are we totally fucking  turned around  matt no i mean you have a decent sense you are maybe 100 to 150 feet from where you began  because youve been moving slowly staying stealthily youre moving very carefully and very  slowly and judging by the shape of the cavern and where you are currently youre about halfway  through it or close to halfway  taliesin its good that we didnt go on the catwalk /none/  matt the temples on the opposite side of the chamber  liam oh all the way on the other side i thought it was central  matt im sorry when you entered the entrance the temple was to the front and to the right of  you you guys curved around the left on the other side of it keeping a view on it so you could see  it from across the way are you making your way across to the temple  liam so its pressed against the opposite wall of this big place  sam are /none/ the undead all around the temple  matt further in nothing directly around the outside of the temple so you guys curve around  the entrance where you came and slowly make your way towards where the temple emerges from the rock  wall about a third or so of its exterior wall is actually built into the side of this cavern and  the large cylindricallike colosseum temple structure curves outward you can see as you get  closer to it theres maybe the three floors to it but edges of the top wall have crumbled inward and  /none/ you can see areas where it looks like its sustained some physical damage or eroded over  time you eventually make your way around the outside wall of the temple to one of the first  doorways and it is an archway maybe six feet tall and about four feet wide very simple this  is an old temple  liam is that light you talked about coming from one specific source or all over the place every  window  travis is there a story  matt it looks to be coming from the base  liam from down /town/ below  laura can we see in one of the windows  matt you can look inside make a perception check  sam are there any bone laying around  matt plenty  sam i am going to pick up two bones give them to simon two and tell him to go across the street  50 feet away from us and wait there in some building hold these bones  matt you watch as two bone shards slowly glide over then stand there  laura 34  matt okay as you pull up to the window and glance down /none/ you immediately look inside the  temple and you see about 30 or so silhouettes of shambling dwarven corpses all standing inside the  base floor of this temple you see the silhouettes and shapes because they are all faintly outlined  from the source of this blue light you see a small baseballsized bluish crystal that is  resting not in the perfect center of the temple but somewhere in the open middle floor area and  it looks like these 30 undead are surrounding it and standing  sam smash and grab you could go in there and /town/ get that thing be out before they even saw you in there  taliesin also have your unseen servant make a bunch of noise and have them all  marisha be a distraction  laura yeah but making any kind of noise would draw large crowds  taliesin we can have the unseen servant pick it up  marisha how far away can he be though  sam hes 50 feet away right now and hes waiting to make noise  taliesin what if he were to go in and get it himself  sam he could  travis he /none/ is invisible isnt he  sam he could go and pick it up and come right back with it  laura but first dont tell him to come right out tell him to like walk a little bit to see if they  follow the light  liam but what are our options if that doesnt work  sam if he picks up the crystal and it doesnt work or it doesnt move  liam i want to do that if that doesnt work i can click the boots and i can be there in a  heartbeat and run /none/ but what do we do next  sam we need an escape plan right how many can fit on the carpet  liam this goes back to my conversation with you which is are we going to find a pocket and rest  taliesin yes but not here  liam agreed but were talking about vasselheim and is damage to vasselheim a sacrifice needed to  be ready to do whats necessary  travis if he destroys vasselheim he does his miracle his display of power and he will be even  stronger that is not an option  taliesin /none/ if we were to be clever if were at the edge of vasselheim the vasselheim forces will be  distracting his forces so well have less to deal with so we want this fight to happen at the edge  liam so were talking about no rest im not talking about a short rest  taliesin there will not be a long rest i dont think  laura there might be  liam not without him spilling into vasselheim  marisha ive been very conservative with what ive been doing for a reason  travis i dont think a long /none/ rest is in the cards  taliesin ive only burned one thing that requires a long rest  marisha i agree with grog we cant sacrifice having him gain all of those followers because  then the only option would be murder a lot of his followers which im not really comfortable with  travis and he may be too strong at that point  sam we dont need to discuss this now we need to get the crystal and get the fuck out of here  taliesin if we can pull this off without burning anything important then it /none/ doesnt matter  marisha i want to go on record and say i think this is stupid okay lets go  laura that crystal looks really appetizing and i want it  travis how about we get ready to leave ill get on the carpet  laura it looks really super magical  travis whos on the broom with vex  laura me  travis no who is on the broom with you  taliesin ill be on the broom with her  travis do you want to get on the carpet with me  sam yeah of course  /none/ marisha i have to come with you because i have the pass without a trace spell  taliesin we all have to be together we cant separate  travis and he can fly  sam no he cant hes done with his wings  liam yeah thats right  sam we have too many people for the carpet and the broom  liam my wings are gone theres no wings for vecna unless we rest  travis well kick trinket out of the necklace and ill get in there  taliesin i can also climb up the wall if need /none/ be  sam we can leave trinket  liam its fine i still have the boots just the wings it was death or wings i chose wings  travis all right so how do we fly how do we do that  sam i can burn a spell and be a giant eagle or something  taliesin just for shits and giggles im going to take one last look around to see if theres any  infrastructure for getting up there must be infrastructure for getting up here there wasnt  layers of a city on top of each other /none/  sam we could just run  liam but wait where are we going though if we get this thing  sam up away  liam we have no verification of an exit or a hole or anything  travis yeah sometimes you just got to leap okay  liam thats my entire life but this is the last moment  sam every organ in a body has an entrance and an exit right wait no lungs dont they just  have the one  marisha wait up we argued more this game more than anything else okay we know /none/ we still have to  fly upwards including on flying up to the blue crystally thing right  laura no the blue crystal is right here  marisha well then what the fuck  laura i dont know  liam we have a plan for getting the crystal just not how to get the fuck out  marisha we fucking fly  travis who burns a spell to become an animal  marisha i can burn a spell  travis you do that  marisha were probably going to take another short rest right  travis probably  marisha okay /none/  sam i can recall simon 2 i can send him across the room make a bunch of noise draw a bunch of  people over there you run grab the crystal and then we hustle out of there  travis what if only half the room leaves though  laura no you go get simon 2 to go get the crystal  sam and theres going to be a floating crystal that marches across  travis they dont give a shit do it im on the carpet were ready to go  marisha youre on me and youre on /none/ carpet and youre on broom  travis percy and vex are on the broom  matt gnomes on the carpet with grog you and percy on the broom youre transforming into what  creature  marisha giant eagle  matt giant eagle  marisha not yet though  laura and then we all within 60 feet of each other fly up  marisha okay  matt okay whos doing what  laura simon 2  sam simon 2 is going to go get the thing lets say they all start watching the thing come towards  us grog are you /none/ here are you with us  travis yeah i have to be  sam can you throw something across the room to make a noise  travis yep i can absolutely do that  laura ill prime an arrow  travis i have a hooded lantern that has fuel in it it will even burn when it lands its been  sitting in there for four years  sam this is a terrible plan  taliesin this is why we hoarded it in the first place  sam guys im just going to say this one more time before we /none/ do this hes way faster than simon 2  simon 2 could create a distraction he could snatching noise  liam scanlan only with the boots  travis if they chase the jewel fuck the jewel and well leave  taliesin if they chase the jewel we can grab it and run anyway  sam all right simon 2 come back with your bones  matt the bones shift over towards you eversoslowly  liam singing dont worry be happy now  sam all right simon 2 go to the middle of the room throw the bones away far then /none/ grab the  crystal you dont have pockets run back to us away yeah should he cover it with a blanket or  something do you have a hood  matt the bones begin to drift  taliesin okay im not saying no  laura a handkerchief to put over the light  sam so it blocks the light all right so go put this handkerchief on the thing pick it up and  bring it back to us go simon 2 youre our only hope  matt is simon holding bones or a blanket  sam hes holding a /none/ blanket  taliesin and laura hes holding a hanky  travis put the bones down gently  sam give me the bones i put the bones down heres a handkerchief youll put it over the  crystal pick up the crystal and bring it back to us  matt simon begins to slowly walk the handkerchief floating by  taliesin this is like those little handkerchief ghosts you would make in kindergarten  matt as you glance inside and watch as it happens you can see all the undead that are in  there are standing unmoving swaying a little /none/ bit in place simons about 30 feet out from them  about 20 feet out they dont notice his presence you notice that all the undead are facing the  crystal by the way  laura and marisha why didnt you tell us that before  marisha laughing thats crucial information  sam right before he picks it up hock a rock as far as you can  travis not the lantern  taliesin not the rock the lantern light the lantern and throw it  marisha by the way theyre all staring right at you theyre 100 percent aware /none/ of whats going on  matt theyre not staring at you theyre staring at the crystal  laura they will be staring at us what if we destroy the crystal i wonder if all the undead  would die lets keep going  matt the handkerchief makes its way forward simon walks between the undead and they dont  even notice  sam thats a good guy that simon 2  marisha what happens  matt the handkerchief moves over onto the crystal and all the undead look over to the  crystal and the crystal lifts and they all /none/ begin to groans  travis i take the hooded lantern and i laughs i throw the fucking piss out of it  matt make an attack roll roll and add your strength modifier  travis oh thats good 19  matt youre adding your strength modifier to that yeah youre aiming at the opposite end  travis if the entrance is here im throwing it in the opposite direction of where we are  matt with your strength easy enough you lob it it arcs over flame noises and explodes the oil  spreads across the ground flames ignite and /none/ the bright light that emanates from it and the flames  burst and all the undead turn over grunting and begin to retract away two of them are following  simon only two of the undead are following simon currently the others are distracted by the  detonation of flame they look confused  liam how close are the pursuers  matt theyre making their way slowly no theyre much faster than simon  liam im throwing  laura im going to get down and shoot  matt okay  laura just the ones following simon  matt both of /none/ you guys roll an attack  travis are they far away from the other ones that arent leaving yet  taliesin it doesnt matter theyre not paying attention  laura 25 no 33  liam 29  matt roll damage  taliesin they drop out of nowhere they faint its going to be good  marisha so we hope  taliesin i thought you were made of sterner stuff travis come on now is not the time to get  squeamish  laura 24  taliesin we made a solemn oath  sam they were innocent  taliesin we agreed /dung/ weeks ago  liam i rolled a 77 for mine  sam 77  matt these two skeletons almost atomize as theyre walking theyre both gaining on simon  and as they both start reaching towards where the dull bluish glow mostly muted by the  handkerchief is floating in the air they growl towards it you watch as both their heads and  torsos scatter across the ground like a heavy wave of force blasted them across the stonework  the scraping sound hits as the detonation hits the flames are dying down and no no other  undead /none/ see it slowly the stone floats past out of the doorway and makes its way back to you  taliesin drop it in the bag of holding  matt at this point simons getting real close to the end of his hourlong casting time  sam youve served us well  travis bag of holding it doesnt hurt my hand or anything does it  matt no  travis cool weve got that  matt whatever it is  laura i guess we have it  marisha nothing happened to them when we put it in the bag of holding /none/ they were like groaning  and kept going all the undead  matt all the undead inside that were distracted by the explosion of the lantern are riled up now  and theyre starting to wander around and some of them are starting to make their way towards the  entrance to the temple some are making their way toward the staircase to head upward  marisha are we flying  travis yes we fly up  matt all right you go into eagle form grab vax and all of you guys make your way up into the  cavern /none/ entrance  laura bubble tight bubble  matt currently i believe the eagle form has darkvision right now you have no light source  liam i do i can say things to her i can see  matt right so you guys are able to maneuver so as you guys head up into the center part of the  cavern above the catwalks you can see as you push through about a third of them are still  standing a lot of them have collapsed in the center and theres edges of bridges that come to  a halt where /none/ theyve collapsed and tumbled down into the cavern below you can see straggling  undead wandering the catwalks and these pathways along the edges of the cavern as you pass forward  through them i imagine you guys are cruising through as fast as you can  taliesin trying to avoid them  laura well try to avoid the clusters  matt a few of them seem to glance up and see you as you pass and reach but they have nowhere to  go as you begin to cruise through the center of this cavern following it to the /none/ opposite side it  widens further and now as you look down faintly you can see bits of the orange bioluminescent  fungus that are growing within this city below you can see elements of these beautiful statues  that are partially crumbled you can see small homes that litter the center of this chamber  you can see some of the catwalks that meet in the center of this actually meet in a suspended  platform that contains another domelike structure that is partially caved in with another shake and  impact of the titans footfall you watch as /none/ one of its suspension pillars cracks and the entire  center finally gives way and falls and slams down collapsing into the center of the chamber it  being there for the final moment of its tensile strength as it slams down you watch as it  crushes about 40 or so various skeletons below and from that blast you can see something on the  interior of it was apparently explosive or flammable and it explodes giving a brief flash  of light into the center of this cavern where you had the brief outside of your visual range /town/ you  now look around and see the entirety of these dozens of catwalks and the city below you  hundreds and hundreds of roving skeletons and mostly decomposed mummified dwarven corpses that  all glance towards this explosion some have been blasted away from it by the impact of the  detonation others are making their way towards what the strange sound was drawn towards it but  youre keeping this central safe space between where none of them can grasp or assail you  laura were there other buildings like that ready to fall from the ceiling  /none/ matt currently what you see is just the one  liam im looking for gaps or holes or anything in the ceiling of this cavern or anywhere to get out  matt you see entrances to homes that are built into the sides  sam what about a tunnel or anything  matt make a perception check anyone who has darkvision can make a perception check  marisha i have keen sight does that count  matt you have advantage on your perception  marisha oh shitty and shittier  liam 27  travis 18  laura 18  sam /none/ i didnt do one  marisha 28  sam im weeping over simon 2  matt oh your keen eagle vision wait you said you rolled shitty and shittier and still got 28  marisha i have a plus 13 plus advantage  matt right all right cool so glancing through your eagle vision you can see the top of the  chamber almost seems to come to a conical shape and as you look up to the top of it it emerges  into a completely vertical chamber that rises up and out of the central opening of the /none/ city of  thomara  sam lets go  marisha i take the lead i guess caws  laura shushes caw quietly  liam vax is trying to appreciate his last ride  travis debbie downer  liam no way im not going to stop fuck you all every game until the end motherfuckers  matt as the group of you make your way up into this vertical cavern were going to take a break  i need to take a break myself  travis remember we have the  travis sponsored announcement  matt thats right we have the /none/ shadow of war video coming up at this break to give you a glance at  this game coming up that were all part of if you havent seen it or if you have seen it check it  out anyway its pretty awesome also for this weeks giveaway wyrmwood weve got a little  video for you here to show you whats up and what you can do and try to win it at the break so pay  attention stick around and well see you guys here in a few minutes  liam this is whats up  /none/ travis yeah  break  matt hello everyone and welcome back all right so last we left off you guys were all  traveling upward through various means of flight through a peak in the central cavern chamber in  the center of thomara the longdead dwarven city  as you begin to climb upward through this 15footwide or so upward hallway this  cylindrical cavern you continue upward for about 50 or so feet since passing through the ceiling of  this chamber and then it opens up into a domed room immediately as you fly up you see /none/ a  ceiling come up and you have to coast off to the side you catch yourself hovering there as the  rest of you guys make your way in there this domed mushroomshaped chamber with a very thin  circular floor around the outside with the hole that you entered at the bottom whoever would  stand on the edge there would have the opportunity to either leap into or toss something down into  this hole that would then drop them right into the center of the city  taliesin weird question if i were holding the blue /none/ gem and had dropped it down this hole what  would be the likelihood it would have ended vaguely where it ended up  matt not at all it was a ways off  taliesin just checking  laura are there any undead around us right now  matt currently glancing around you do not see any undead  marisha you said things or people is this a bodysized hole  matt no its about 15 feet wide the full chamber is maybe 50 or so feet across about  a 20foot walkway circular before the hole in the center /dung/  liam did you say the hole is a natural gap in the cave or does it look made  matt if you glance down and look about the interior of this chamber it is not natural it is  all carved  laura can we look at the gem for a second since theres no undead around  matt if you want to grog has it  travis do you want me to pull it out  laura yeah can you do an arcana check on it  sam sure i can look at it  laura how big /none/ is it is it baseballsized  matt its about that big  travis no undead right no creatures nobody thats going to whoop to the shiny blue light  laura we cant see anything around us  matt not at the moment no  sam i remove the handkerchief i look at it i inspect it like a jeweler inspecting a jewel 18  arcana check  matt okay its definitely magical the blue light from it grows stronger then weaker  stronger then weaker it has this rhythmic flash to it like a heart or something that has a /none/ pulse  to it  marisha how is it lining up towards the steps of the giant  matt not at all its much quicker  marisha much quicker  matt its cold to the touch  taliesin does it do anything to the titanstone knuckles  liam is it faster than my heartbeat  matt its slower  liam slower  travis thats slow  marisha so its very slow but not as slow as the rate hes walking  travis is it a cut jewel or is it rough  matt its rough no jewelers hand has touched /none/ it there are some edges that have flat surfaces  it looks like there have been things that have chipped off the stone  taliesin does it have the vibe of something petrified  matt no it has almost a quartzlike look to it elements of it appear to be cloudier or imperfect  and some areas appear to be clearer and light shines through a little brighter  liam its like a hunk at the natural history museum of minerals  matt yeah but there is an enchantment  sam what about pikeypants can she detect if its evil /none/ or good or something does she do that  laura you should do that  liam im going to do that  matt okay you dont get a sense of any evil from the stone  sam you said no sense of evil  matt no evil coming from the stone  laura okay im going to gaze into it super hard  matt you look really hard into the stone as you hold it to your face and your eyes almost cross  as you glance into the very core source of this pulsating arcane energy its bright  /none/ laura so bright yall  matt it hurts a little bit and you wince after a while  laura i saw so many things  liam she looked at the eclipse too  travis we dont have identify or anything like that do we  marisha and sam no  laura you know who had that  sam no who  laura our good friend tary he was wonderful  sam who is it oh the fancy fellow hes probably dead somewhere  travis i think we should try and smash it  sam dont you think that about everyone /none/ and everything  marisha im not against this idea  travis what else are we going to do to it before we face el vecna  taliesin my only other thought of how it could be useful at this point with what we know about it  sam is el vecna spanish for vecna  travis sí  taliesin it seemed like the undead were crowding towards it which means that if we do get attacked  by a group of undead we might be able to shinyobject them unless of course its  dangerous in their hands  travis /dung/ or we spike it down the hole and it causes a hydrogen bomb and we shatter this titan in half  taliesin that literally made the dungeon master laugh so i dont know if thats necessarily  travis its blue right that is the color of hydrogen  taliesin thats the color of dr manhattan i dont necessarily know if its the same thing  travis it is known  sam why dont we hang onto it for now in a moment of peril we can throw it or smash it  taliesin not crazy trying to crack it  /none/ liam what if it stops this thing where it stands were all thinking that this thing could be its heart  sam its heart  travis its palmsized right  taliesin it could be a chunk of heart  laura is it the same color as his knuckles  travis no these are stonegray this is blue crystal  matt theres nothing about it that gives you the sense based on what youve seen both outside and  within the titan that it is of similar essence to the titan from what you understand  travis it could be a /none/ soul or something  sam soul glow  travis does pike have anything that detects a soul  liam its not evil its not good it could be the thing thats keeping these undead moving  travis well then i dont know what else to do i think we keep moving  liam i like the spiking idea  laura im okay squishing it with the hammer  liam i think that you should let me squish it because if that blows up  laura i think its funny that we spent so much time getting it and then were /none/ going to destroy it  liam we spent ten minutes getting this thing  travis well think about smashing it when we take our rest maybe a cause will reveal itself  taliesin hold onto it for now it could come in handy  marisha its like that dress you bought four years ago you still havent worn it might find a  purpose  sam all right focus  laura lets get out of this dome  travis is there any writing or engraving or runes on the edge of the circle thats been engineered  matt on the /none/ edge of the circle no its smooth stone intently designed to be a drop or opening  of some kind  taliesin are there exits  matt make an investigation check you dont see any doorways or passageways  marisha wait theres not a hole that we can go up  matt theres a hole that you came through to come into this chamber imagine a dome youre in the  chamber  taliesin i literally rolled a one im aware that theres a hole  matt you get vertigo as you stand in the chamber  laura is this /none/ investigation or perception  matt you look about and you dont see any exit investigation to see if theres any hidden or  notimmediatelynoticeable exits or entryways  laura 23  matt 23 as you do a pass around looking closely along the wall you see two small domed doors  that have metal rods jammed through almost like a small barricade thats been placed down on one  side of a doorway however they are closed from this side  laura so you could open them up  matt you could  laura are they trapped ill look to /none/ see if theyre trapped  liam on it  travis also fair to assume that whatevers on the other side of that door  liam 27  matt 27  laura i rolled an 18  matt youre both looking at the same one  liam yeah  matt neither of you notice any traps  laura all right then im going to try to jimmy open that lock  travis whoa  laura i already said it  matt make a strength check  liam not locked  laura two wait yeah thats straightup strength not a saving throw /none/ two  sam two  laura im really fucking weak youd think id be stronger pulling the bowstring but no  travis use your legs really use your legs  laura okay i put my legs up on the wall and grunts  matt it is not budging  liam can i use my finger skills to see if its locked just my finger skills i made a perception  check to see if its trapped wouldnt i know if its locked  matt the lock is the barricading mechanism on it there is no handle  liam im going /none/ to try to sidestep this lock with my lockpicking skills  travis and marisha its a barricade  liam theres nothing to do  marisha its like steel rebar in front of the door  travis is there any decorating or writing or scratching around the door frame or wall around  the door anything other than a portal to go through  matt not from what you can see no the rooms pretty simple the construction of it may be older  than most of the things that youve seen in the city below and previous chambers it seems /none/ to be  built almost for function rather than ceremony  laura its a trash chute  marisha thats what i was going to say is it a water chute drainage is this a drain pipe  laura we could fill the city with water drown all the zombies  matt one thing you do notice which is interesting as youre glancing around at the side  looking at the ground at the bottom of it theres a very faint groove in the ground that  leads toward the central hole at the base of each of these doorways  /tavern/ marisha does there appear to be any other type of chutes coming into this room  matt no just the two doors on the opposite sides  travis how far apart are the doors  matt opposite sides of the chamber yeah  taliesin so theres a bar the door is barred then  matt correct  taliesin so break it lets get out of the way and pop the bar see if we can pop the bar right  off the door  travis do we want to have keyleth there in case 900 undead zombies start pouring through /none/ and she  can wall of stone the door  marisha ill be with you yeah im right behind you man  travis i will try and remove one of the doors i dont know how to delineate between them  taliesin the left one  travis sure yeah its a circle that one 25  matt 25 it immediately comes off to the side and when you lift it you realize that its bolted  to the wall to the side and it curves upward and holds it in place this is meant to stay in place  laura /none/ wow really it was meant to move i think i loosened it for you grog  travis i didnt get that sense at all  matt as you lift it up the door is now unbarred  travis shall i  laura yeah open the door  travis are the hinges on this side so it looks like it opens towards me  matt it looks like it opens towards you yes  travis ill pull open the door  marisha im at the ready for whatever  matt okay well say as you entered and landed the door on /none/ the left okay so as you pull that  one open immediately preparing yourself a couple of rocks tumble out and it reveals a packedtight  mass of earth and stone  laura shit lets try the other one  travis should i punch the rubble  laura no lets try the other door first  travis i make my way around  taliesin we set ourselves up  travis 20 on the dot  matt 20 metal creaking it lifts over without an issue pull the door open you lift it open  and a few rocks tumble past /none/ but a slick rockslide incline continues upward dry no water nothing  travis a rockslide continues onward slick dry  laura how big is the tunnel  matt its about four feet wide or so  laura so we can fit in  matt yeah you can fit in  taliesin we have some immovable rods  matt when i say slide i mean smooth stone like an actual slide you get the sense that there was  some sort of aqueducttype scenario  laura we brace ourselves on the wall to make sure we dont slide down  taliesin /none/ whoevers in the back should have the immovable rods so if theres a sudden rush of  water we can create a grate for ourselves  matt you envision that at one point long ago this would have been a beautiful waterfall in the  center of thomaras chamber that has now dried  travis dope thats awesome im getting creepy as fuck now ive got the immovable rod ill be  the caboose  marisha ive got the other one so ill be second  matt so grog is the caboose  marisha keyleth in front of grog  /none/ matt keyleth in front of grog all right whos in front of them  sam me  matt scanlan  laura pike  matt then pike all righty  taliesin myself and the twins i suppose  laura yeah i want to be in the front  travis ill go ahead and take the immovable rod out and have it in my hand  marisha samesies  matt so youve got both of those oh i totally forgot there was a winner for this im sorry i  should do that huh ryanboo youre the winner danoba will contact you /none/ and get you your cherry  deck box soon now thats taken care of  you make your way up the slide and its relatively gradual its not too heavy of a  scenario you make your way upward upward and about 30 or so feet up the walls of it separate  out and appear to break into two smaller chambers like this was a breaking point where a person  could enter from either side to check on the flow or do maintenance on whatever the ducting was the  slide continues upward vax and vex you get /none/ to that portion and lift yourselves up looking right  to left it ends on one side and it looks like theres some dryrotted wooden crates and to the  left a staircase  marisha so it looks like a landing  matt its a brief landing for somebody who needed to come in and do repairs maintenance or  checking on the flow of water  laura keep going up the slide or take the stairs  liam quick glance in the crates  marisha no if youre going to take a quick glance then we have to bust /none/ them open like a  proper rpg  travis theyre dryrotted theyll break easy  matt they will what do you do  liam check them out i eat some edamame  matt so you lift the crates there are only two of them and theyre relatively small two feet by  two feet the first one you open up and look inside and there are rusted tools long iron  bars some appear wrenchlike it looks like whatever mechanism was used as the early aqueduct  system for this this box contained materials though youre uncertain as to what /none/ their  application was into this system  taliesin ill take a glance at these things to memorize their general shape  travis after youre done with them ill actually take them  matt you go and grab a few theres five rods of varying widths some appear to be ratchet  elements where they fit around different metal caps theres one that looks like a wide crowbar  thats used to hold or wedge elements separately very basic nothing too intricate  taliesin this is some basic shit that youre picking up right now  liam that was the /none/ first crate whats the next crate is it whoopee cushions  matt no the next crate you open up and it looks mostly empty but it looks like there are a couple  of rows of small glass vials half of which appear to be broken or shattered but there are three  remaining with a faint bluish liquid on the inside  laura does that sound familiar to us at all  liam healing potions are blue  matt these dont resemble healing potions actually  taliesin do these resemble underwater breathing  matt they do youve seen these /none/ before  liam for toilet diving  taliesin emergency yeah lets take those  travis okay i got them  liam i give one of them to percy for being so sharp i give one to my sister you dont need it  i keep one no i dont im barely alive i give one to scanlan  sam i give it to grog  travis ive got one ive got two actually  sam all right then ill keep one  taliesin just in case  travis ive got two vials of underwater breathing  matt all righty  /none/ taliesin why is there no water running  travis any other boxes to smash  matt no  marisha id imagine because hes vertical now instead of horizontal  travis and undead  sam lets keep going up the stairs  matt all right heading up the stairs in the same order  liam 30 to 40 feet in advance  matt all righty 30 to 40 feet in advance okay you make your way up the staircase roll stealth  travis immovable rods out  liam 28 for stealth  matt okay are you stealthing as well are you /none/ going along with him or are you letting him go  ahead  liam shes coming  laura natural 20  matt all right so the two of you very quietly make your way ahead the rest of you keeping  within i assume the range of the ring the staircase doesnt go too far it goes maybe 30 or  so feet and then it opens into a hallway youre stepping up through the floor and theres about  ten feet behind and to the sides of you theres a slight element of a cavein to the left of /none/ you  where part of the stone seems to have collapsed and a bit of the earth has filtered in its a  smooth stone floor thats tiled in places the walls continue on a somewhat trapezoidlike  angle there are other portions of the wall that have caved in on certain elements and there are  two large pillars that mark the center of this hallway either used as support beams or  decorative but they go from ceiling to floor  you glance over the side and you see a distant staircase on the far end of this /none/ hallway maybe 80  to 90 feet from where you are if not further with larger stairs youve seen some of the  dwarvenbased ones these seem to be a little more grandiose as they lift up higher and higher part  of that hallway is completely collapsed its a wall of fallen earth but theres a hole carved  out of it theres a tunnel that has been pushed through you hear this very faint buzzing sound very  faint this low humming a very faint vibration you also see a figure stepping from a side wall  crevasse /none/ an opening of a similar shape to the circular opening in the wall  liam i hide  laura we were stealthed  matt you guys were stealthed you rehide while stealthed  liam thats what i do  matt you hear some muttering across the way in the shadow theres a faint source of light that  looks like a glowing orb thats floating in the air above and giving this faint greenishwhite  light a bauble thats giving a light source to whatever this cloaked figure is you hear the  muttering and two more walk down the /none/ staircase to join them you recognize from the faint bit of  light a glimmer of metal around the neck of one of them that is the symbol the hole with the  metallic fork you see remnants of vecna  sam remnants  matt you dont see any faces you see a glimmer or shine on the metal from the light cast from the  bauble  marisha and taliesin what  taliesin this cant be happening right now  liam we dont recognize faces we dont see faces  matt you see hooded figures that are walking in /none/ there are three of them  marisha oh so theyre cultists  matt okay so which ones are you aiming at theres three of them  laura im aiming at the first one i saw  matt okay the first one you saw just stepped out of the center of the hall there and then the two  others walked down the hallway youre aiming at the one that came out of the side of the wall  laura has he seen the two coming down the stairway yet  matt theres been discussion over the shoulder they seem to /none/ be aware of each others presence  but they havent come together to engage as three in the same area yet  liam i will follow my sisters lead if she attacks one i send one to another one and two to  the third  laura ill attack the first so he can take the second  liam one two three  matt okay  liam yeah  matt all righty  laura these are autocrits though because we are surprising them  matt this is true  laura can i hunters mark him  matt yes you can /none/ hunters mark him  laura oh so we dont have to roll for attack its an autocrit  matt well no you still have to roll to see if you aim you have advantage on the attack  laura 27  liam 27 on my first  matt okay both hit  laura second attack oh my god 20 20 on the second attack  matt okay that hits  laura i got a one on both thank god they were both at advantage  liam 27 19 25  matt okay all three hit  laura and theyre all /none/ critical  matt no the first one crits  liam oh really okay the first is sneak attack  matt theyre not all crit once you hit the person they are no longer surprised  laura okay so the first one is a crit solid thats okay  mairsha yeah i feel so bad for you  liam you are the most powerful person at this table  laura 14 plus six lightning damage oh wait you know what should i single out the lightning  damage or say what all the damage is  matt well its an autocrit /none/ so lightning damage is doubled as well  laura so its 12 lightning damage  matt right plus whatever your sneak attack damage is  laura okay  taliesin yeah thats happening  travis you already did 40 point of damage without doubling  laura dont do that  sam travis shut up these two and their gigantic damage rolls  taliesin huge mammoth  sam huge bulbous  taliesin turgid  laura i had already rolled that but it was a six again so 40 plus 12 lightning damage on the first  matt 52 points of damage  /none/ liam i got 48 on my first but thats it 48 done  laura i didnt do hunters mark damage on that first guy  matt this is on the other guy the second guy  laura add ten because of hunters mark on the first one  marisha little bit of that reach around  sam the dice smell a little bit  liam 48 20 ten  matt so 48 on your critical  liam thats the critical thats the dice damage i rolled really low  matt 20 ten okay then all righty are you shooting the /none/ same guy laura  laura yes i was all on one unless he went down would i notice  matt no he did not go down  laura okay then the second one 21 on the second one  matt that does it  travis how much damage total  matt total on that round from you would have been 110 with the first hit between the two of you on  the first guy and the second hit so the one that was off to the side who is leaning forward  hunched over and looking over his shoulder /none/ the first arrow goes into the throat and he reaches  for it and as he does the dagger impact into the face into the socket where there is no eye  which then looks up with a groan finger goes out as soon as the second arrow takes the other eye  out and then falls back down to the ground dead pointing your direction like gasping as soon as  the two other daggers go into the other two they both see the one crumple to the ground the two  left there the guy who is standing /none/ at the stairs  liam may i also dump some poison  matt sure into which one  liam into the first one i did one into my first target and two into the second the poison would  have gone into the second person its a dc of 15  matt all righty dc of 15 yeah that succeeds 16  liam so nothing right  matt nothing yeah  liam balls  matt as soon as the one crumples to the ground and the two other daggers into the other two that  are there they grunt they /none/ see the one fall the one in the center of the chamber glances over  his shoulder and says it seems im the lucky one odell run back and tell that viskorad found  sneaky prey the one immediately to the left begins to run up the stairs  laura can i shoot him again before he runs away  matt nope because you took your turn this is their reaction  sam oh shit you need help matt  liam initiative  matt were about to roll initiative motherfuckers  laura sorry guys we did it  marisha viskon /none/ weve heard the name viskon before  sam weve also heard the name odell  liam yeah odell  marisha odell comma tell viskon we have visitors wait when did we hear odell before  liam i just know weve heard it  sam theres been three jamiesons in our campaign too matt isnt an infinite fount of names  matt everyone else is still down the stairs right there  laura i wonder if we should have let them talk for a second oh well  liam thats not our way  matt apparently not as recent events have /none/ shown so now i need everyone to roll initiative  travis dont fuck me gil  laura no its okay ive got advantage  marisha dont let them leave i agree with that  taliesin leave one of them alive but dont let them leave  liam not good for pike  marisha did everyone roll shittily  travis no  matt 25 to 20  laura 23  travis 21  liam get that long range get that runner  matt 20 to 15  sam 18  marisha 15  matt all righty  marisha whats

this guy though  matt no  laura okay 14 plus four lightning damage and then im going to hit him again that is also a  32 no thats well its very high 27 28  matt 28 all right that hits roll damage grog youre up next youre in the back of the marching  order  travis were not up at the top are we  matt no so youve got at least 25 30 feet before you can /none/ get to the top there  laura 12 plus six lightning damage  matt nice all right 36 points of damage in one round the arrows impact as he is pulled through  the rock and rubble by the grasping vine that is currently wrapped around him  laura i am going to use my movement to stand behind this little pillar right here  matt okay go for it grog youre up  travis as i hear the sweet melodical miami vice tunes of warfare being played can i double dash  up past my mates and into the /none/ fray  matt sure so at 30 feet itll get you right at the edge of the stairs still have 20 more feet  you can go  travis yeah straight towards them  matt all right so thats there  travis then can i use dash to go the rest of the way  matt to close the gap there sure  travis now i only have my bonus action left so can i go into a rage  matt you may yeah all righty so at that point you go into a rage  travis thats my turn /dung/  matt all righty so now it is his turn  marisha you have that guy but this guy was the runner i thought  taliesin yeah but hes vined  marisha okay hes currently grasped  matt okay as soon as you rush up into his face you hear the individual the hood pulled back at  this point you see shaved entirely bald older late fifties to early sixties missing one eye  but in that socket you can see a faint spark of arcane energy shouting out amongst the space  glory and reward is mine wraiths /none/ go forth and devour while i bring oblivion to them as you  rush up is going to cast wall of force right in the space between there  marisha between him and grog  laura singing the space between  sam singing your wicked lies  matt it pushes you back five feet and now there is a wall of force that is blocking that side of  the hallway from where he is  marisha him and the other guy or just between him how big is it  matt sorry the entirety of this chamber is the /none/ wall of force  marisha fucking fuckface  travis what does wall of force do can i walk through that shit  marisha yeah it just might hurt  travis will it  matt as soon as the wall appears there you see a slight short barrier that forces you back about  five feet you catch your back foot and now as the barrier finishes shimmering its invisible  looks like theres nothing there hes grinning from there he glances over to the right into the  hole in the wall where his friend was earlier  travis which /none/ was that way right  matt as he glances over he goes odell bring me the sphere you hear the humming noise the  faint humming vibrational noise now louder that ends his turn actually he is going to take a  step back up onto the stairs there scanlan youre up  sam im up what can i do  matt youre 20 feet down from the staircase  sam my speed is 25  matt thatll get you right up to about there with fivefoot steps  marisha dont let them leave  sam oh god this looks /none/ like a crazy thing  travis counting 60 is how far away he is  sam wow theres a wall of force do i see a wall of force  matt you dont you actually rush up and it looks like its an open hallway right now  sam okay i see grog in attack mode right i see these two bad guys i will send a lightning bolt  at somebody  matt which one  sam looks like i cant see this guy because there is a pillar in between so the other guy  matt thats true /none/ so itll be that guy all right youll have to move off to the side or  else youre going to hit grog with the lightning bolt its going to be hard hes up a few steps  though you could probably aim it above and hit him without grog ill let you do that as you get  to the top you release your bolt of lightning crackling noise it arcs forward and as it gets  right above grog it hits something solid and splinters no effect  liam so this wall of force visually is floor to /none/ ceiling  matt you dont know you dont see it he saw a faint shimmer because something pushed him out of  this space but right now you have no visual perspective thats going to end scanlans turn i  believe all right the other guy who is currently held by the vine that falls limp off of  his body  laura it falls limp off of his body  matt well it doesnt wrap around or keep him held every turn it can pull something towards  it hes going to glance over towards the side listening to /none/ what the other viskorad said okay  at which point that humming gets louder and louder  taliesin he had the map if he built the map theres a way out  matt you watch as a twofootwide black sphere of voidlike nothingness comes carving through the stone  wall immediately to the left of you grog leaving a completely disintegrated form roughly the shape  of its sphere its coasting in towards and into your space  travis its a sphere of annihilation  liam yes it is  taliesin oh shit son  laura oh god  sam /none/ is someone controlling it  matt so grog i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw  laura oh my god roll so well do you get advantage  travis i do i have danger sense it fucks you up yeah it hurts real bad  sam i see this happening right  travis 16  matt 16 okay you manage to duck out of the way as it enters the space and you can feel this  weird energy your beard is almost being pulled toward it and the loud vibrating vibration hum  before /none/ you its like staring into an absolute nothingness  travis take my life but not my beard  marisha who looks like hes controlling it odell  matt the guy who is being pulled by her is concentrating and moving it over at that point  laura oh the guy in red the guy in red is controlling it  matt all right thats going to end his turn keyleth youre up  marisha yells  matt ive got to rest for a second controlling enemies hurt its okay  sam we can get dudes behind you to hold you /none/ up  matt well see how i can do it keyleth your turn  marisha oh my god so much has changed from what i thought i was going to do  matt youre about 25 feet down the staircase  marisha yeah so i come up from the staircase  matt okay that gets you up to the edge there where the staircase stops  travis does the sphere of annihilation get an attack of opportunity if i run away  taliesin probably not  sam is it a thing is it a weapon  matt its a black /none/ sphere of void one of the guys is looking focused concentrating on it and it  moved under his willpower in the direction of grog  travis its real bad  marisha okay im going to come up im trying to think of what i have in range and im terrified  and im going to stick with my original instinct and do wall of stone and try and wall these guys  in so they cant run i think they can still carve through it with their big black death orb now  travis they can but at least /none/ theyll be here  taliesin theyll have to move the orb to do that  marisha okay i can do ten tenfoot by tenfoot panels so i want to be a semicircle block off  bring up a whole wall of stone behind them  matt okay hold on a second  travis who can get to the other side you have dimension door but thats it right thats the  only person that has that kind of a thing  matt as you attempt to concentrate and create a wall of stone you are unable to pick a point /none/ or  an area beyond the barrier  travis the wall of force no  laura say it again  travis and you need to focus or is it a random  matt it doesnt fizzle the spell you have no area to release it on the barrier while  invisible is preventing targeting a specific area to create  taliesin we need to dispel this shit  marisha i do have dispel magic  matt youve used your action to attempt it you didnt lose the spell slot but you spent your  action attempting it  travis hey /none/ man that was a nice try  marisha cant cast through it  laura good to know but the orb went through it  matt no the orb is on the other side  marisha even though its a nature thing going up underneath there i cant get around it no  matt youre targeting on the other side of the wall it has to be in visual range for you to  create it to happen  marisha singing ill see you on the other side of the wall  laughter  matt all right thats keyleths turn no /none/ sorry at the end of keyleths turn you hear this  breathy noise sound as these two shadowy figures emerge from the nearby walls  liam ghosts shadows  travis no what ghosts or wraiths  marisha wraiths  liam theres ten different kinds of things like that  marisha hey was wraiths what fucked me and you up when we were evil vax and keyleth  taliesin oh shit and look what theyre doing  matt this one hovers over and lands behind keyleth and its going to attempt as it seems to  shift through the pillar  /none/ marisha i look over my shoulder and go oh no  matt this one here stays within the pillar and it reaches out as its incorporeal and strikes  at you that is 24 against you vex  laura that hits  matt all right you suffer 21 points of necrotic damage and i need you to succeed on a  constitution saving throw  liam fuck come on  travis my fucking god  sam its a 20  screaming  matt all right well you suffer the 21 points of necrotic damage and your maximum hit points are /none/  reduced by 21  laura forever  matt until you finish a long rest the other ones striking at you keyleth that is a 16  marisha misses  matt thats right because your ac is 17 with the ring  marisha thats right i leveled up motherfuckers  matt all right cool technically leveling up didnt affect your ac however calculating the  magic item did  marisha but i feated so im good  matt i know so as it swings toward you its claw streaks out and has no effect and then they both  vanish /none/ you want to take an attack of opportunity you can if youd like to  marisha war caster  matt war caster you can attempt to cast a spell on it as a reaction if youd like this ones  going to back away into the wall as well vex you also get an attack of opportunity if youd  like with a melee weapon  marisha does it have to be a bonus action  matt no it can be an action thats part of the war caster feat  laura i have a dagger but i dont even /none/ have it drawn  matt then yeah youre fine  liam theyre both out of visual range right  matt they both are now backing up  liam ones in a pillar and one went through a wall are they moaning and shit in the wall  matt you cant hear them  liam i cant hear them cant see them cant hear them all right thanks  matt no worries  laura i have resistance to necrotic damage by the way  matt you do then you take ten points of necrotic damage and your hit points are only /none/ reduced by ten  laura okay  marisha sorry im trying to figure out what would be a good idea right now  taliesin i have no ideas for anything  marisha i have never done this before but i have it learned i will ice knife it in its face ice  knife level one you create a shard of ice fling it at oh its a flingythingy but its 1d10  piercing damage and then it explodes  matt okay its right next to you she has the feat where she can cast the spell as a reaction /none/  when something comes at her just know that whatever youre hitting is right next to you so  if it explodes does any radial damage it might come back and hit you  marisha no hit or miss the shard then explodes the target and each creature within five feet of  the point where the ice explodes oh im fine im doing it anyway  matt okay go ahead and roll to hit  travis and scanlans in five feet of her  laura no hes behind her  taliesin oh for fuck sake  marisha whats wrong /none/ with us  laura wasted all of our 20s on goods  matt tonight is ridiculous  marisha one  matt all right so as you release the ice knife it slams into the wall no effect however it  does still explode right  marisha yeah  matt so it does what damage  marisha 2d6  matt 2d6 damage so go ahead and roll 2d6 to both you and the creature  taliesin yeah all creatures within range  marisha technically reroll ones three four five six seven yeah each creature hit or  miss the shard then /none/ explodes  matt all right so you take seven points of ice damage and it hits the wraith however the cold  damage doesnt seem to have as much of an effect as you would expect  laura its a fucking wraith  matt that ends their turn percival youre up  taliesin i hear a whole bunch of commotion so im going to pop my head up out of the hole and  see what the fuck is going on  matt all right you glance up and get just beyond where keyleth is pushing past you have five /none/ more  feet you can move if you want  taliesin well im coming up the hole i take a look oh sweet god im going to take a shot at  the guy i see up on the table there  matt okay go for it  taliesin thats better  matt which guy  taliesin yeah the gray and thats 28  matt okay gunshot you fire a shot and watch as it detonates against some sort of invisible wall  that you didnt see was there before scattering helplessly against the space in the air  marisha /none/ i hate this force field shit  travis it explodes near my head and im like stop shooting into this thing  taliesin im going to drop back down the hall  matt all right you get right back down to right there that ends your turn percy vax youre up  liam heres what im going to do im going to dance through to here where i can see grog and  these guys and i can see all my friends here and im going to hold my action to attack anyone who  comes right up to one /none/ of my friends within striking range  matt okay good to know perfect ending vaxs turn pikes up  laura pike comes running up the steps  matt she can get right up to here and thats as much as she can move she can still cast a spell if  she wants to shes going to cast beacon of hope for all of the allies within range which is 30 feet  matt all right so that is everybody but grog  laura sorry grog  travis thats my fault  laura that gives everybody advantage on wisdom saving /none/ throws and death saving throws and any  time youre healed you regain the maximum number of hit points  sam even if we move out of the radius  matt it affects everybody at that moment and then you carry it with you  laura wisdom and death saving throws  liam you got glitterbombed with holy goodness  marisha wisdom and death plus what  laura and full hit points when you get healed  taliesin you dont roll you get the max  marisha beautiful  matt okay so ending pikes turn brings us to the top /none/ vex your turn  laura oh great well ive seen all the things explode fucking hell im going to pull out my  vecna symbol that necklace that we still had and put it around my neck because that fucking sphere  is out and i dont know if it matters  matt okay so you quickly throw it around your neck  laura do i still have control of the vine  matt currently yeah  laura okay and its on the other side of the force  matt this is true  laura so im going to use /none/ it and im going to try to grab a hold of the guy the guy in gray is  holding the force wall right but it probably is a concentration the guy in red is holding the sphere  matt correct  laura the guy in red is holding the sphere im going to try to knock him down and see if i can  break his hold on the sphere maybe is that stupid  matt he does not make his save he isnt moved it wraps around him and pulls him tight against the  area where it /none/ is again but its barely shifted him so he gets moved a few inches but doesnt  seem to affect him at all  laura thats a bonus action i still get an action  matt yep and movement  laura and movement oh god im going to spread out im going to come over here maybe or here  oh jeez i dont know i cant hit anybody im going to wait im going to hold my action until i  see something getting through that fucking force wall  taliesin until theres something to hit  laura so /none/ that i can attack him  matt sounds good all right vex thats the end of your turn grog youre up  travis im going to try and run through the wall of force its only five feet of my movement and  well see what happens  matt all right you slam facefirst into a stone wall immediately the anger fills through you  the familiar smell and taste of ironlike blood as you seem to have busted some element of your nose  in the impact  travis probably some eyelids do i go anywhere not even an /none/ inch  matt no  travis what if i channel all the rage from my life and i draw on the undead okay cool im  going to turn around and run the other way  marisha you didnt get through  travis no it didnt even give apparently counting 50 right there  matt okay that ends your turn grog  travis yeah that ends my turn  matt this guy turns around and begins to make his way up the stairs and move double dash and  disappears up the stairs  marisha screams in frustration  travis /none/ we cant do anything nobody knows disintegrate or anything  marisha whose turn is it  matt that finishes that guys turn it is now scanlans turn  sam im going to take a few steps forward i will inspire grog i guess  travis or yourself  sam im okay  travis really okay  sam ill sing to him singing dont mess with that big black ball it can really fuck you up i  really hate that big black ball all it better do is miss you make it miss you  matt oh my god that /none/ was not my intent in creating this encounter take your d12 inspiration die  travis thank you  sam and i guess ill dimension door try to go through the wall of force weve tried this  before matt who knows how this shit works  travis and the previous ruling was it worked  sam yeah but that could have been a gentle nod  matt the wording is important on this  liam i think the cultist shits his pants and his brain explodes i think thats in the book  matt ive had to look this up /none/ very carefully with elements like this wall its a targeting  thing you cannot target something that is in full cover total cover which being behind a wall is  teleportation however youre the target and dimension door and teleport is unaffected by that  sam matt fucking hates this  marisha get the runner  sam i dont know where the runner went  marisha he went that way  sam i dont see him right  matt you saw him run away you just dont know where he is at the moment  sam can i gauge roughly /none/ how far he went down that hall do i see down the hall  matt not from where you were over there  sam so im going next to the red guy  liam also if you get out of range of vex vecna knows all  laura oh yeah stay within 60 feet  matt all right so you dimension door there thats your action  sam thats my everything  marisha weve got to take out these guys eyeballs  matt thats the end of your turn at which point odell whos standing there currently is  physically /none/ sweating concentrating on this sphere right now looks over and sees you appear and  goes viskorad the little one made it through  sam who are you calling little  matt at which point you glance over your shoulder and you can see that the darting cloaked  one stops and spins and faces towards you  sam thats not good for me guys  marisha its not good for you but its good for us fuck them up  travis oh god  matt thats as far as they can get however it completely disintegrates the central pillar /none/ it is  obliterated like it lays with a top part and a bottom part but wherever the sphere passes  through about a good six inches around it is turned to dust and is gone  laura oh my god what if we fail these rolls  matt hes then going to go back around  taliesin and liam no hes grappled  matt no it doesnt grapple it just moves things toward it  marisha youre confusing entanglement with grasping vine two totally different things  matt hes backing up and hes looking over at the sphere concentrating /none/ on it you can see the  beads of sweat pouring down his face and hes glancing over nervously at you but smiling at the  idea that his friend is returning thats going to end his turn keyleth youre up  marisha okay seeing grog slam into that ugh fuck this is a pretty beefy spell yeah force  wall should i do fifth or sixth level to dispel this okay fifth or sixth level sixth level im going to  dispel magic this wall  matt okay as you focus and concentrate you release the essence of the /none/ dispel magic the burst  of arcane energy casts forth and falls harmlessly against the exterior  laura and liam its a higher level  marisha higher than sixth level the spell  matt didnt appear to have an effect on the wall  travis come on maybe it needed to be something else  liam no he did what scanlan does with counterspell he beefed it up  marisha okay  matt you can move  marisha its higher than seventh level did you have to roll  matt no effect on it  taliesin okay its going to /none/ be okay everythings okay  liam so about that long rest  marisha i dont know now you guys  laura were fucked  marisha i move forward i guess i dont want to move that far forward no i dont move that far  forward  laughter  marisha i dont want to die  matt that finishes your turn keyleth  liam singing i want you to be alive  liam and marisha singing i want you to be alive  laura and taliesin oh no here they come  matt they take minor damage being in the /none/ physical wall but thats fine with them  liam boom i attack sneak attack on the one near keyleth  matt emerge all right so the one near keyleth go for it  laura what was i holding for i was holding until i could attack something or until i could get  through the wall i think it was through the wall  matt the wall  liam all right 27 on that guy  matt that hits  liam okay so that is three plus three is six so ten counting  taliesin if we can hit them /dung/ theyre probably squishy  matt you took out one of three between just two of your surprise attacks  liam 34 for the first hit and i have the second paladin attack so if its not dead i will attack again  matt go for it  liam that is eight for the second  matt as it emerges from the wall its blackened shadow form giving off small tendrils of dark  black ether and abyssal energy it reaches out to strike at keyleth and you immediately release two  daggers in its direction both hit its form it /none/ gives this pained sucking sound as you watch its  beady burning red eyes seem to blink in the pain and it angrily lashes out at keyleth its form  somewhat more disparate and unable to maintain a corporeal form  liam when is pike is it her turn no okay  matt no she cast beacon of hope so attacking against pike that is 21 whats her ac  laura 23  matt 23 it tries to strike at her and she manages to take the shield and bash it away the  light from her mace arcing around /none/ causes it to flinch and it actually strikes a little too wide  the one thats arcing towards you keyleth that is fucking 16 again yeah because its plus six  to hit okay you dodge out of the way a second time its then going to move back into the wall  over here hes going to move back into the wall as well both of you get reactions  laura pike definitely takes it with her mace of disruption she gets an extra 2d6 radiant damage  matt all right so roll an attack on that one  /none/ laura thats a 21 to hit  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  travis i am wickedly out of my element im running from an 8ball  taliesin weve got to get everyone away from that thing  laura 27 for pike  matt 27 points of damage  laura is it a fiend or an undead so it has to have a wisdom save of 15  matt if it has 25 hit points or fewer after taking the damage which it does not that one  has not taken a whole bunch of damage however /none/ it did take a relatively decent hit and you watch as  she swings the mace out as it pulls back where the mace impacts it seems to almost evaporate  part of the shadowed form and it shrieks as it disappears into the wall  liam for clarification that is the one i hit as well right  matt no the one that you hit is where she was  liam oh pike hit the other one  matt correct keyleth are you doing anything as a reaction  marisha yeah im going to pull out my staff and /none/ do a burning hands on him dexterity saving throw  matt natural 20 so it takes half damage  marisha half damage  laura ooh thats good you did the six and the four  taliesin and then there was a third one  marisha and then theres a third one that is a six was that right six and six is 12 so 16  matt 16 points of fire damage reduced by half which is eight and even that impact seems to be  lessened by the wraithlike being seemingly absorbing some of the heat from the impact /none/  laura radiant damage is the bomb  taliesin radiant damage is what we need in here  matt all righty that ends their turn percy youre up  taliesin im going to stay in my little cubby hole ive got some good visual on a couple of  these guys down here im going to yell at everybody to get the fuck away from the ball im  going to hold my attack until something happens thats going to give me something to shoot at  matt okay so as soon as an enemy reveals itself that you can /none/ shoot okay that ends percys turn  vax youre up  liam fucking hell im going to do the same thing except im going to move to here and wait for  something to attack one of my friends  taliesin thats awfully close to the ball  liam i know it is thats what i do im waiting until one of them attacks one of my friends one  of the undead i cant do anything about that thats what im doing thats my turn  matt all right pikes turn  liam stupid i know thats what vax /none/ does  laura i can only do this as a bonus action so that she can have that up right okay shes  going to cast spiritual weapon should she do it at a second level okay shes going to cast  spiritual weapon up near the wall as a giant sword that looks like its on fire  matt whereabouts on the wall here  laura no near the wall yeah up close to the wall so that she can attack as soon as that thing  is down and then shes going to hold her physical action until /none/ theres something that she can attack  matt okay shes holding her physical attack  laura yeah her mace  matt okay that ends pikes turn vex youre up  laura oh thats me  matt yeah thats you actually  liam youre vex  laura im vex im going to dart away from this ball as fast as i can and im going to come up here  sam hey you broke through  laura i broke through the wall i cant reach im too fucking its fine i got it  sam make matt stand up laura  /none/ matt please do i appreciate it  laura and im going to hold my fucking attack until something comes out that i can attack  matt okay all righty  marisha i cant believe i couldnt fucking dispel that wall  matt grog youre up  travis yeah i am arent i okay cool  laura wait i have bonus action still  matt you do  laura okay im going to use that grasping vine that i still have up and im going to regrab  onto that stupid guys fucking neck and yank him towards the wall hes /none/ right in front of  matt thats a 15 whats your dc on that  laura 15  matt he succeeds unfortunately it slaps out towards him and this time i forget the adage  but never mind he dodges it  laughter  liam it took 425 hours but we did it we broke his brain  matt blame it on the painkillers the vine whooshes out and tries to wrap around him he  dodges out of the way and it slaps harmlessly against the stone and withdraws back into the  small crack of stone where its /none/ based that ends your turn all right grog  travis im going to put my faith in scanlan that some sort of impossible miracle happens  counting 30 right up against the wall can i look to the left down that hallway can i see down  there at all is it blocking the hallway off from vision is that a moveable space  matt looking off it looks like the orb was being used to carve a path  travis it hadnt finished doing it  matt no it was maybe 25 or so feet down and was hitting /none/ solid rock  laura my spell dc may be higher i dont know if i have increased that in a while  liam its eight plus proficiency bonus plus her spell bonus  laura so my spell dc is 17  matt you need to keep up on that girl  marisha that was how i lost to grog in our battle  laura i wanted it around his neck just to make him annoyed  matt it hits him against the wall hes still glancing over his shoulder  taliesin hes lost visual range of the ball  matt /none/ no he can still look over the rubble there  travis not enough to make a concentration check  matt if thats what it does  travis im there i cant get into that hole anymore can i  matt not with the way the wall of force is placed no  travis fair enough i will hold my action until someone comes within melee distance  matt okay ending grogs turn at the top of the staircase  laura oh no hes coming back for scanlan  matt this guy here well say he got about that far from /none/ the stairs and continues that way  marisha sanctuary  taliesin like hes parting the red sea  taliesin and marisha you shall not pass  laura oh my god were going against gandalf right now you guys  taliesin thats not gandalf thats a cosplayer  liam do you know many hobbits i have under my cloak  taliesin five hobbits in a cloak thats all it is its not a wizard  matt he glances down at the staircase where you are and as he begins to smile the flash in the  eye begins to glow briefly /none/ a pale comparison to vecna but there is an essence of energy lent to  him from his worship of the newly risen deity he begins to speak in a language you dont  understand and as he speaks one alien word how many hit points do you have  sam a lot 167  matt fuck okay i miscalculated no effect  sam power word  matt power word stun he assumed the smaller stature of the gnome was not as hearty  travis hes upset that he miscalculated the dm wants blood  liam thats what he gets /none/ for profiling  matt hes going to continue moving upward 30 feet back up into the staircase as he keeps  focusing on you thats going to end his turn youre up scanlan  sam hold on i need to look up the range of a fucking spell how far is he from me  matt its hard to tell at this point youd say somewhere between 50 60 70 feet  liam i bet your spell is 120 feet sam  sam im looking that ones not  liam is it thaumaturgy because thats right where your eyes are /none/  sam you said how far oh shit  matt between 50 and 70 feet from you  laura and liam you can move  sam yeah im going to move 25 feet towards him  matt okay so that puts you up here  sam and with my darkvision do i get a sense for how far he is from me now  matt yeah youd say hes about 40 feet from you  sam fuck no its not shit i need 30  laura you can move five more feet youve got more movement  sam no thats /none/ my movement i have tiny little nubs  travis tiny little nubs  sam yeah  liam what about longrange shit man  sam thats okay yeah ive got longerrange shit but its not as bad news  marisha keep them from running away  travis damn it matt whyd you have to back up  matt because that tactically made sense  liam bigbys hand him grab him  sam im thinking im trying to decide between two things  travis yeah do it take your time baby take your time taliesin give him a backrub come on  /none/ lets focus up here there you go support feel the love  marisha this is all on you man this is all on you  travis do your thing listen shadow of war comes out october 10th a lot of us are in it  sam its going to have a lot of wisdom all right i will bigbys hand i assume hes got a  lot of wisdom so i will bigbys hand him at level seven and i will punch the shit out of him  laura punch him back toward us bigbys hand on the opposite side /none/ of him and punch him back toward us  marisha thats a good call  matt all right so that is 8d8 force damage if you hit roll a melee spell attack  laura and taliesin inspire yourself  sam i didnt i forgot i rolled an 18  matt 18 hits hes a caster he doesnt have a lot of armor  marisha kill him  matt all right so roll 8d8 force damage  taliesin i have

notice did we notice that the wall went down  matt no you dont see it  sam i dont know right  matt but grog would feel it /none/ grog is sitting there waiting for something as bigbys hand  fullon sucker punches him in the body and he slams against the steps and has to shake his head  as he glances at the giant fist and down at you  sam as a bonus action can i do anything  matt if you want to do a bonus action you cant do bigbys hand again  sam no but can i throw something to see if it goes through the wall  matt sure ill let you do that roll an attack roll just to aim it /none/  sam sure 17 plus i dont know  matt what are you throwing  sam scanlan found these two really crappy daggers in the desk in the casino  matt he pulls one of these jeweled daggers that he wore and throws it behind and grog you watch  as this dagger passes through  taliesin i see that and i take three shots at this fucker up here immediately how far away  is he  matt which guy the who bigbys hand just punched okay he is about 120 feet  taliesin im going to use bad /none/ news then because that is within range for my fucking sniper rifle  hes going to take that  laura im going to shoot at the dude in red in front of me  taliesin i cant use a bonus action and i have to reload once so i can only take two shots with  my action i cant take three so two shots with bad news here we go thats a 25 and 27 to hit  matt both hit  taliesin first shot is 22 points of damage second shot is not as good 14 points of /none/ damage  matt so as you fire those two shots the echoing noise of bad newss explosions echoes through the  hallway and stairway above vex  laura im going to sharpshooter him the guy right in front of me  taliesin theres a lot of noises going on in this place i think itll be okay  marisha oh its fine there are tunnels collapsing and shit its fine im not concerned  about the noise at the moment  laura 22 to hit  matt 22 does hit  laura 21 damage on the first and then 19 /none/ on the second thats also sharpshooter  matt nice  laura no thats 19 to hit  matt gotcha that hits  laura 27 on the second  matt all right nice the guy whos controlling the sphere after the first arrow strikes him  right in the chest he looks and starts to run up the stairway and as it does you take aim with  your second arrow and release it and it hits the base of the skull you watch him go down one of  the stairs  taliesin so the sphere is still there  /none/ matt the sphere is still there  laura but he doesnt have control over it anymore this guy in red is down so all thats  left is the guy and the wraiths  taliesin was there a third guy  laura we killed him that was the first guy we killed  matt that finishes scanlans turn right  laura yeah that was your turn  sam yeah im done  matt keyleths turn  marisha okay i run up as far as i can 30 feet do i see this motherfucker  matt yeah you see him you /dung/ have a 60foot range of darkvision  marisha or i see the glimmering of bigbys hand  matt yeah id say you could probably see him okay a little bit its very dark but barely  marisha fireball  laughter  taliesin thats an answer  matt as you rush up from the edge of the staff a bead of red light engulfs the hallway above in  flames you see a split second of him and bigbys hands outlines before fire engulfs the space go  ahead and roll damage on that thats a natural 20 on his save /none/ so he gets half damage  marisha what the fuckballs  matt i didnt even roll with advantage on that one  sam you said fireball on this guy bigbys hand takes damage  marisha does he magical  sam yeah he has hit points  taliesin he could roll a save though  sam he could  matt lets check yep it has no bonus so you roll a d20 and see what you get  sam 11  marisha 29 points of damage  sam its fine bigbys hand has 167 hit points  matt yeah it has /none/ your hit points  laura thats amazing  sam yeah its me  matt that ends keyleths turn hes still alive this ones going to move through the hallway here  marisha hes still going after my ass  matt this ones going after pike  liam i get to attack ive been holding  laura pike gets to attack pike has been holding her action to attack as soon as she could too  matt so pike gets her attack and so do you  laura so 20 to hit on pike  matt 20 to hit that hits /none/  laura where is my other d8 here it is counting  liam when you hold does bonus action carry over  matt nope just the action  laura so its 22  matt 22 all right and whats the saving throw  laura saving throw is 15  matt 15 four no as it comes out of the wall reaching for pike she swings wide with the mace  as it slams into it theres a flash of divine energy her eyes seem to pulse with a matching  burst of radiant power and as it hits the creature /none/ squeals and squeaks as the light from the  mace actually dashes it from this existence or any other that is scattered into nothing from the  shadows  liam i rolled an 18 and a one  matt 18 hits one misses  liam okay so sneak attack one  sam one misses  laura i know right  liam 39 for the second attack  matt 39 for the second attack all righty and with that as this one reaches out towards  keyleth your dagger strikes the back of its body and as it impacts you watch /dung/ as its shadowed form  turns into nothing but a splash of dark halfexisting ether which then fades as your  dagger clatters to the ground motionless  liam back to the belt  matt all right percival youre up  laura kill him  taliesin reload going to take another shot  matt all righty  taliesin going to take a shot yeah lets take another shot probably got a low ac lets make  this a sharpshooter just for fun yeah thats a sharpshooter shot so thats a 24 to hit  matt 24 hits  taliesin all /none/ right so lets do counting 26 points of damage  matt 26 points of damage gunshot the echo of the impact as you watch part of the lower jaw and  throat of the cultist in the robe gets blown apart he stumbles back onto the steps that he had  barely started to get up off to and you watch and you hear the horrible coughing sound as his last  moments of life are robbed of it as it tries to get back up and then stumbles right back and  bleeds out against the steps  taliesin /none/ we can still interrogate him he doesnt have to be alive for that any other problems  liam hows the ball doing  matt its hovering there in the center of the hall  laura we cant do anything about that floating ball cover it with a handkerchief  marisha you beat me to it man  taliesin lets rifle through these guys stuff which one do we want to interrogate  marisha keyleth goes up to the red robe  taliesin lets throw gray robe into the annihilation ball lets get rid of him  travis vax why dont /none/ you go down the hallway and see if anyone else is coming keep watch  laura but stay within 60 feet everybody gather up around me again  liam sis come up to where scanlan is so i can go a little further ahead  matt everyone is barely still within 60 feet  taliesin everyone gather up were going to get our stuff  laura avoid the ball  marisha vax can i borrow a dagger  liam yeah i give her whisper  marisha i take it and i stab it in his other eye red robe guy /none/  matt okay splat other eye is destroyed  sam im going to use bigbys hand to grab the sphere  matt do you okay bigbys hand reaches over and grabs towards the sphere and as bigbys form  attempts to grasp the chaotic point of destructive energy bigbys hand suffers 26 points of force  damage and is forced to pull back  sam thats not so bad  matt but cannot grasp it cannot move it electrical shock  laura im going to rifle through the robes of red robe  taliesin im going to get odell  /none/ matt thats the one shes rifling through  taliesin oh okay there was a third guy right that they killed early on  matt oh the first guy yeah okay gotcha  taliesin assume were going through everybody and taking their shit  liam im standing as far from vex as i can but i cant go much farther because obviously yeah  matt okay interestingly enough based on the current scenario and what preparation has been no  money on them they have no worldly possessions that are what you consider of use they each carry  a gnarled /none/ wooden wand that theyve been using as a focus for their spellcasting  beyond that they have nothing on them except for the one that you shot has you notice the  left hand is withered and gray the skin is pulled taut against the bone but beyond that there is  no other possessions on them beyond the symbol of vecna they wear around their throat  marisha how many of those symbols do we still have and how many robes do we still have  laura well we can grab their robes i dont know how many of /none/ those we have but i think we also  have a necklace  liam also we can have pickle talk to one of these arseholes  taliesin i think thats a good idea  marisha the guy that im standing over red robe im going to rip his necklace off  matt okay you tear it off  laura im going to take his robes  taliesin oh yeah were taking all this shit  matt so you take every set of robes and these robes are different from the robes that you had  seen in thar amphala before /none/ these appear to be a little more ornate they seem to have a little  higher station which is why its interesting that beyond the robes and some basic undergarments and  the wand they have nothing on them they are a sheer conduit of their own power  taliesin were they drilling i want to take a little bit of an inspection were they drilling  with this thing is that why they had it  matt looking around the pathway you can see that a lot of the staircase probably was more caved in  but has been /none/ cleared out by the movement of this orb its being used as a form of excavation tool  as they push deeper into the catacombs here  marisha so they were holding on to that orb the whole time  laura yeah the guy in the red was controlling it  marisha yeah he didnt cast it though we didnt see him cast that  laura it came out of the wall  matt yeah it came out of that little gap on the side there  sam im going to go over to the sphere and say to it /none/ i command thee to respect my authority and  obey me as your new master  matt are you trying to exert your will on the sphere  sam im intimidating the sphere  matt make an intelligence arcana check  sam intelligence arcana check  matt just an arcana check  sam oh 19  matt 19 and youre standing right next to the sphere to push your will into it  sam yeah i came closer to it  matt okay as you stand there you focus on the orb and you can feel your will push past /none/ the  event horizon of the sphere however the force is too strong inside and as you pull out of it  instinctually it moves towards you  screaming  taliesin why did you have to tamper with the fundamental forces of nature  matt yeah ten feet which is right where you are so i need you to make a dexterity saving throw  liam matthew mcconaughey is going to reach out of it for you  sam thats not good 11  matt 11  sam bigby save me  matt the orb pulls back and slams into /none/ the edge of his gnomish face and chest and you watch as  his flesh is pulled towards and disintegrated at the exterior of the sphere  laura can we reach down and grab him away from it  marisha yeah grasping vine  matt you take 30 points of force damage and its currently now right in your square right up  against you  laura i use my grasping vine and i yank him away from it  marisha yeah move away  matt okay so you all push him out of the way and the vine pulls /none/ him  travis twoface  matt yeah you look a little rough  laura scanlan youre hideous now  sam dont look at me im fine  travis some other voice starts coming out of him  sam i think i can take this thing  liam so did you want me to talk to one of these guys  matt you got the sense that there is a way to exert your will over it the way these guys did  but in that moment your will faltered and you didnt quite understand the nature of the sphere  /none/ sam i just need to try again harder  marisha wait  laura you got to roll higher than a 19 can you give yourself inspiration  sam this is an ability check right  matt this is an ability check yes  taliesin wait was that a wisdom saving throw  matt no it was an arcana check  travis it might be high dude you might have to roll a 30  taliesin lets leave it tend to the sick and leave the well alone  travis indiana let it go  laura or dominate that shit  /none/ sam ill try one more time  matt okay  taliesin all right lets all back up  laura i get ready with the vine to yank him away in case it starts moving toward him  matt okay and everyone else backs up a little  marisha keyleth stares with a vague familiarity  sam im going to inspire myself  matt okay so make your roll first as you begin to focus and exert your will towards it you add  it on to it  sam pretty good  laura now inspire  sam and inspire  /none/ matt up to you  sam okay plus my what arcana  matt yes  sam ooh thats a lot 30  matt okay as you this time begin to push your will towards the sphere you push past the event  horizon your consciousness connects with some  sam garbled listen to me damn it respect my authority  matt some ancient space of the void within this blackened circle as it connects whats your  intelligence modifier  sam plus three  matt okay what are you trying to will it to do  sam im trying to /none/ will it to shit its just a big black ball slam straight into the ceiling  matt it moves up ten feet and then it hits devours the stone above it to create this small  tunnel right directly above  laura oh my god you did it  sam we can use it  taliesin finally  sam have you guys seen the explorers  taliesin im in the explorers motherfucker im in the explorers  sam you are thats one of my favorite movies of all time can i get your autograph  taliesin no  liam were /none/ you kidding are you really in the explorers  taliesin yes im really in the explorers  liam stop the game  taliesin im one of rivers little brothers im ludwig  sam oh wow  marisha yeah he knew river through that  laura what if we use the orb and go straight up we dont even keep tunneling we juat go straight  up to the city  sam it only listens to me  laura yeah do you need us to heal you or anything  sam no this is a cool thing  travis yeah but /none/ it only makes a hole its size its two feet across  taliesin i think hes not ready to pop a wheelie on this thing yet  travis plus remember the guy was concentrating super hard so its the only thing scanlan will  probably be able to do  marisha but if he cores out a tunnel for us we can carry scanlan like on a palanquin like we are  the champions  sam guys i think we can make it no we cant well never make it yes we can  liam all im thinking is i /none/ could come up and do lay on hands and heals but im like you made  your bed lie in it  taliesin yeah no im okay with this  laura what do you think do you want to go up  sam were still investigating these guys and stuff  marisha fuck these guys we got all their shit lets go  sam im going to call this ball simon 3  travis do we know how far the sphere can move in a single movement  matt you watched him push it and it went about 15 feet /none/  travis the sphere can only move 15 feet  sam it will slow us down  matt its a very slowmoving ball of destruction  taliesin bring the sphere back down so that we can throw their bodies into the sphere so that  they dont turn into undead fuckwads  liam wait a second though god i dont know what this will do i have a spell called zone of truth  laura so it forces them to speak the truth does it work on undead  liam a creature that enters the spells area for the first /none/ time if it fails  laura so you could cast it and then pike could cast speak with dead and it would come up into  the zone of truth  liam thats right  travis no they have to tell the truth when you do speak with dead  liam no they dont  matt they dont have to  marisha they can lie  taliesin heres a weird question what saving throw do they have to make to speak the truth  liam an affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to /none/ which it  would normally respond with a lie so it could avoid the questions  laura but they have to answer the questions  liam but they have to answer the questions because of the other spell  laura right  sam double mumbojumbo  matt it cant tell a lie as youre discussing this technically a creature would be unable to  lie in the area  liam unable to lie and with pikes spell  laura and liam they have to answer the question  matt let me doublecheck for you  taliesin and whats the save /none/  liam charisma saving throw against my spell save dc which is not huge  marisha what is it  liam 16  matt i mean it does have to answer  liam i like it  taliesin are we going to try this crazy shit  laura lets do it  marisha might as well okay hang on though what are we going to get from this guy  laura find out how close we are to vasselheim  taliesin yeah whats the plan what are they trying to do  liam what has vecna got cooking  taliesin /none/ whats vecna planning how many of them are there  marisha im going to go pee you guys  liam he might not know everything how long does it take for keyleth to pee  laura no but how close we are to vasselheim whats the plan of attack in vasselheim how big  is his army we get five questions i think with speak with dead  taliesin five  sam how close are we whats his plan where is he  laura where is vecna within the city  sam whos with him  laura whos the death /none/ knight  taliesin he might not know that but what are they excavating for what are they looking for  travis i think i know that  taliesin i think i know too but i want to hear him say it itd make me feel better  laura lets do it cast your zone yo  taliesin get in the zone  laura singing autozone  matt chuckling autozone of truth  liam shit so can anyone drag him down on his roll to save or boost me  taliesin no not me  laura i dont think so  /none/ liam does anyone have a cantrip okay all right lets do it  matt all right so which one  liam well first zone of truth then pike  matt okay so you create the zone of truth you create the area the radial space where the divine  energy kicks in and the compulsion to not lie remains within and then pike  laura casts speak with dead  matt on which corpse there are three corpses  liam red robe seemed more fancy  sam who seemed more senior  liam red robe did  matt there are /none/ three technically  sam there was the guy they killed right when they burst on the scene  taliesin well take the fanciest cloak  matt okay its relative but the guy who was controlling the sphere seemed to be at least  different  laura he had a different color yeah red robe  matt all right so as pike takes the time to focus and recite the incantation she grabs her  holy symbol and focuses and speaks aloud the words in celestial of the blessing of sarenrae and as  she completes the ritual she suddenly screams /none/ out in pain and grabs at her head and falls to her  knees no effect and she suffers  laura oh no what did he do to pike  travis oh shit  matt on 6d6 i rolled four sixes and a five thats 31 points of psychic damage to pike  liam she tried to cast speak with dead dumbfuck  matt shes shaking and grabbing her face and rubbing her eyes and it takes her a moment to  come back to you and she looks around and you can see a faint bit of blood slightly /none/ dripping out of  the corner of her eyes shes like all i heard was laughter  sam laughter  laura and you said it was minus 36 damage  matt 31  liam vecna is in these motherfuckers brains  marisha everyone looks upset  laura pike got psychic damage from that dude  marisha how much a lot  laura 31 points of psychic damage  marisha oh thats a lot yeah  taliesin burn the bodies fuck it  marisha throw them down the well  taliesin throw them into the sphere  marisha oh yeah  /none/ sam sphere do your worst  matt one by one you grab and take the corpses and thrust them towards the sphere as they  immediately crumple fold and get pulled in turned to nothingness disappearing into the black  void there are elements of the way the sphere acts and manipulates things that remind you of the  siphons though differently its more violent in some ways and it is its own contained magical  entity with each body it vanishes in the sphere and you all sit there for a moment taking a breath  and deciding the /none/ next order of business in traversing the insides of this titan  and thats where well end tonights game because its 1130  marisha i feel like i always come back from the bathroom right as were ending games  sam first of all its so great to be back  taliesin its so nice to be back  sam matt thank god youre totally 100 percent healed and all better again  matt its great
