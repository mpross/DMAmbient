none	 destruction theyve swept across all of taldorei and  continents beyond they found themselves going to the continent of marquet across the central  desert meeting the parents of gilmore and coming to the city the jewel of marquet known as  ankharel you found yourself wandering the streets meeting curious individuals our gnome  apparently has made a spice deal that is to come to fruition at some point in the near future in  search of the bearer of one of the vestiges of divergence you have been seeking in preparation  of your battle with thordak as 
tavern	 well as seeking allies in this strange new interesting city  through the continuous and perpetual threat of evil forces in the world you found a hookah bar  and got fuzzy drunk on a form of sandkhegbased liquor you learned a bit about the city about  the culture you learned from jarett some good possible tips on how to engage with the people  around the town  laura oh be pleased  matt yes be pleased  liam and travis beepbeep  matt and you guys made your way towards the cerulean palace in the center of 
none	 the city after  being balked by the hand of ord upon arrival you were then greeted by the grand maven and given  entry to the cerulean palace upon passing up a large translucent blue tower above the city of  ankharel not emon i was tired  marisha we knew what you meant  matt i know i figured you guys would be all right with that and eventually opened into a  central chamber at the very top of this tower that overlooks the majority of the desert from this  position that you can see there 
none	 were large windows across the entirety of this circular room  there was a raised platform in the center balcony across the opposite way and sitting atop this  throne in the center made of brass and sapphire you met an individual seemingly the ruler for a  long time of this city the androgynous longliving figure known as jmon sa ord and that  is were picking up this  travis and the grand maven took us up there  matt yes  marisha and we saw him and we met him right he was like hello  matt 
dung	 just greeted you when we left off  laura he knew who we were  marisha right  matt he she youre not quite sure what the sex is of this figure specifically the fine features  elongated limbs and long dark hair seem to deflect trying to pin down a lot of details about  the history or source of where this individual came from however they have risen from the  throne bowed deeply and greeted you welcome to ankharel heroes of taldorei i am jmon sa ord  it is my pleasure to greet you and gave 
none	 you a soft bow your arrival has not escaped my  whispers and im curious if your presence means what i think it means  laura what do you think it means exactly  matt i have heard our skyport access to emon was balked by dragon attack i would hope the problem  would be sorted by now for the purposes of our vast trade network and youve arrived i hope  with good news  travis oh yeah its like a mixed bag a little good a little bad  marisha hmm id say its mostly bad  
none	 travis its mostly bad  taliesin its good news in progress  marisha hmm mostly bad  taliesin my version of good news in progress  laura we are making headway weve taken down one  taliesin we have a problem that as far as i know has never been accounted for in the  history of civilization the dragons are cooperating with one another we are fighting not  one dragon but a conclave of dragons all cooperating towards the destruction and  sublimation of man  marisha it seems as if this is an extermination  liam mostly 
none	 successful  taliesin mostly  laura they mostly come at night  travis mostly  taliesin they plan at dawn  matt so you say these dragons are working together attacking and destroying i assume they  are of the chromatic origin then  laura yes  matt working together is quite strange hmm what else can you tell me of this threat  laura a great ancient red one known as the cinder king is sitting on emon  marisha he appears to be their leader  taliesin he was released somehow from the plane of fire  laura 
none	 by a green dragon raishan  matt raishan i do not recognize this name what is the name of the red you speak of this cider king  travis thordak  matt theres a subtle reaction from the creature before you draws back and narrows their gaze a  bit at the mention of the name thordak yes scoffs i recall this name a foolish drake from  the scaldwind sands who saw unwisely to threaten my domain many years ago we cut his heart and  watched him sink beneath the ocean this creature you speak of i do 
none	 not think it is the same  thordak  travis no  marisha why wouldnt it be  matt because i watched him die  travis oh but our thordak he has like this thing that is at the center of his chest right  its like a jewel  laura its replaced his heart potentially  travis and if you sliced his original maybe he upgraded  taliesin or perhaps someone brought him back to life  laura not unheard of  matt so this beast that harries you you are certain it goes by the name thordak  
none	 laura certain  matt what proof do you have of this being the same beast  taliesin other than his heart obviously having been previously maimed in some way we have no  proof that it could be the same beast we were not here but even if it isnt the same beast the  fact that a dragon takes its name should trouble you  liam and weve heard of your success before and were hoping you could offer us a little guidance  taliesin it is an old dragon  matt the thordak that came to war here 
none	 was not quite as large and powerful as you seem to  say this one is  laura how long ago was it  matt this was centuries ago the city was but maybe 100 150 years at the time  laura he could have grown by then  marisha yes im afraid were not talking about a drake anymore were talking about an ancient  fullgrown dragon  taliesin god knows how time works in the fire elemental plane he may be much older than time  has allowed  travis with respect you were here centuries ago  
none	 matt the creature known as jmon sa ord they steeple their fingers and glance over to you at  head height with you practically even stepping down from the platform  travis oh shit  matt i have been here for some time yes  travis ive got to get your diet sometime thats amazing  taliesin grog in general it is impolite to query the age of any being in general  travis oh right  taliesin i would have assumed you would know that by now  travis stammers beepbeep  matt the stillnarrowed black eyes with a 
none	 tiny pinpoint of molten metal peeking through relax  the arms go from a steepled position to a cross and now a look of curiosity comes across their  face if this is truth then how do you plan to fell this everburning worm  laura that is the question isnt it were collecting items vestiges of power hopefully  with them in tow we will be able to gather armies to combat thordak we know we cant take him on  alone  taliesin were also gathering allies and weve already destroyed several of his companion  dragons  
none	 matt you have  taliesin we have  laura well a couple  travis and we did recon on a third  taliesin preparing to kill a white dragon  matt so am i to understand that you are spearheading this endeavor  marisha well its sort of unofficially  taliesin were as surprised as anyone yes  marisha you know we didnt necessarily ask for this it just fell in our lap  travis it fell on our city actually  marisha yeah thats true our keep came crashing down on around us and then we were committed  
none	 matt very well then what do you want from jmon sa ord  taliesin perhaps if it comes to it a little bit of help possibly collecting the vestige that we  are looking for in this city that we are currently hopefully collecting and being on our  way with causing as little noise in the city as humanly possible we are aware that is complicated  for people like us and perhaps an ally in the coming battles to come it may i would imagine  please you to perhaps meet these dragons on foreign shores as opposed 
none	 to in your city walls  laura its only a matter of time if we cant defeat them in emon he will spread his  territory  taliesin if it is the dragon that you remember he will come here and if it isnt the dragon you  remember the fact that he took that name means that he will come here  matt this city is well protected i am not worried about this dragon or dragons you speak i  am protector here and we are warded against such threats  liam but you would like to awaken 
none	 trade with emon again yes  matt this does interest me as there is quite a stake in the roads weve built with taldorei  liam is there anything you can share with us from your encounter back then it would help  matt the creature once known as thordak had begun to grow tired of his meager dominion in the  scaldwind sands began to reach out with his many feral kobold armies and various serpentine  followers decided that the very jewel of our city was perhaps a good throne to sit upon and much to  its 
none	 foolish intent attacked not knowing what it was after we struck down its armies and for two  weeks there was battle between the skies of here and the northern mountains before we took a fell  strike against the beast it escaped to the north and attempted to flee beyond the oceans waters  but we caught up to it struck it down and watched it fall into the fathoms if this is the  same beast you say then it is uncanny it could survive such an encounter and would say it is even  more dangerous having 
none	 learned from these past struggles  liam do you think you simply wore it down or was there some angle you used  matt i have my ways we have our ways well you wish my aid  taliesin we do  matt you go running into the furnace and you wish me to be at your side  laura well we dont run into the furnace willingly  travis or hastily  taliesin the furnace is the only exit we wish to just borrow an asbestos coat  matt hmm theres a brief pause as jmon looks past and 
none	 seems to peer through each of you  scanning back and forth with those strange smoldering pupils  travis uhoh  matt you look ablebodied and strong of will however i have watched many of your kind with  these same traits waltz into oblivion before i will not risk myself or my city by backing a  fools whim show me what you are capable of fellows of vox machina show the soul of the  desert jewel what you are capable of and jmon sa ord begins to step back  mechanical whirring  matt and laura what 
none	 is that  liam what strange powers do you wield  taliesin hes using a hydraulic pump hes an imagineer  travis hes omnipotent  marisha its animatronic  travis that was like the best sound cue ever  matt you hear the cracking and the rumbling of something in the distance as jmon sa ord steps  back and fades from view  laura ugh come on  matt you hear a latching of stone behind you as it seems the grand maven has stepped back into the  platform you arrived in and closed it behind you  
none	 travis oh good  matt another loud crack hits the air around you loud grinding and you watch as over past the  other side of the room where the balcony stands a looming shadow plummets out from seemingly the  sky itself and lands smashing onto the marble floor of the exterior its silhouette humanoid  but swollen across the sunlight thats pushing past from beyond  travis sam is here somebody go get sam sams at the door  matt blue dust and pebbles tumble across the archway from the balcony to your side coming to  rest 
town	 the shape squeezes through the balcony arch into the room what you see is a thicklimbed  silhouette marching into the throne chamber a 15foottall armored structure of intricate  decorated cobalt plates and iron bulk dragging a massive cleaverlike blade with one arm and a  clenched boulderlike fist in the other two burning white flames flare as eyes within its  solid helmet i need you all to roll initiative  travis what man you just got back in town  laura we just got here  liam fetch the gnome  marisha the gnome is just in 
none	 time  travis and a map  laura why dont we have fassbender with us  marisha oh yeah where is fassbender  taliesin fassbender is busy being a good guy  marisha fassbenders with wilhand  all hey  laura sam were all going to die  marisha we just rolled initiative  sam so i have some questions for the leader of oh what  travis some shit went down he asked us  sam i know im with this  taliesin i brought you some stickers from burning man  sam thank you  travis i got

none	 in the room  marisha right  taliesin i dont think hes real we just have to kill him  matt as the entity bursts its way into the room its flaming eyes flare vax you have the  beginning of this encounter what do you want to do  liam going to click the boots together and im going to slide over this way between those two  windows im closest to  matt between there  liam yeah all the way to the wall  matt all the way to the wall  liam yeah  matt right

none	 iron plates between the cobalt armor seem to have  carved grooves into them and its actually made an impact on the outside of the creature that end  your turn  liam that ends my turn  matt all right percy youre up  taliesin okay im going to first of all cast hex on this creature  travis attaboy  laura thanks for the reminder because now im going to do hunters mark  taliesin going to cast my hex and then im going to start gentle im going to take three shots  with the retort pistol

none	 on strength checks  matt okay disadvantage on strength checks  taliesin and he has to make a constitution saving throw  matt okay that is a 22  taliesin i dont like him  matt as a note the first shot it hits the head and bounces off seemingly no effect theres a  little bit of necrotic seep into the armor that seems to have affected it to a small extent but  the bullets seem to have almost no effect on its form  travis really  sam but liams did  taliesin no yeah liams not 
none	 doing piercing damage  laura yes he does he does piercing damage but it seemed to get through less than  liam magic  marisha are your bullets not magic  taliesin the bullets are not magic my bullets are bullets  sam maybe its because theyre projectiles  taliesin okay good to know that could go really poorly  marisha is he made of metal or is he a big dude in a metal suit  taliesin we dont know  matt you dont know  taliesin so thats good to know im going to take another shot at 
none	 the helmet for a headshot  matt okay  travis spread out  laura where i dont even see where we are  travis were over there in front of the throne  taliesin 27  matt 27 hits  taliesin better 16 points of piercing damage three points of necrotic and another constitution  saving throw  mat constitution saving throw that is an 18  taliesin he now has disadvantage on attacks until the end of his next turn  matt okay this one does hit the head and it seems to knock it off to the side 
none	 and one of the  flames flutters for a second but leaves no impact or damage against the helmet  travis you are kidding me so is it fair to say that 16 points of damage didnt happen  taliesin at the moment im blowing bullets not for damage im blowing bullets for effect at the  moment this is all effectbased im not trying to damage him right now  marisha singing she blinded me with science  taliesin singing blinded me with science i have one more shot so i guess im going to take  it and 
none	 for shits and giggles im going to take a sharpshooter shot  matt okay  taliesin fuck me 19 27  matt 27 hits  taliesin 21 points of piercing damage four points of necrotic  matt okay once again it ricochets off with a flash of sparks and energy you can see the  necrotic seems to have left this slight burn against the plate but the bullet has left no  groove in the armor  taliesin all right thats cool im putting the gun down and im going to back up im going to  pull to 
none	 my left and im going to try and get against the wall not the glass  matt all righty end of your turn  taliesin end of my turn  matt grog youre up  travis its time to wake up boys and girls so i would like to rage am i in front of the throne  thats me right that big proud fuck over there can i run as far as my little feet can carry me  over in front of percy and more towards along the wall  matt okay so counting 50 is where you

dung	 dragging the cleaver behind it scraping it across the grounds of this palace room  as it moves as it comes sauntering up its large leg movement taking large strides against the  floor leaving a small crack under each footfall it turns around the blade isnt getting ready to  fight instead its flames curl up and darken and you watch as its neck opens up to this dark space  underneath and it roars this fume of purplish blue mist seems to spill out in front of it  laura no  travis oh no hes reaching for 
none	 something  laura oh no area of effect  sam as he attacks can i use cutting words to reduce the attack  laura yeah scanlan do that  matt you are more than welcome to try  travis thats a no  sam ill try  matt so you use your cutting words  sam yeah i say to him oi your face is so ugly im considering casting blindness on myself so i  dont have to look at it  laughter  matt okay go ahead and roll the dice  sam a ten or an eight 
none	  matt d10 its whatever your bardic inspiration is  sam hey six  matt has no affect on it unfortunately all right i need vex keyleth and scanlan to make  constitution saving throws  laura oh no i hate constitution saving throws  taliesin thats not terrible  sam i got a natural 20  matt damn all right  marisha 17 total  laura 19  matt okay this is a lot of dice ive got to roll here so let me  laura oh no how many is a lot  matt counting so as the 
none	 poisonous fumes fill the space you can feel it burning the outside of  your skin filling your lungs you guys start coughing as the horrible burning sensation in your  interior begins to fill your entire experience right now scanlan you manage to pull aside and  close your nose just in time but it still burns your exterior you take 26 points of poison  damage scanlan that is 55 points of poison damage to both vex and keyleth  laura on a 19 i didnt save  matt 20 dc you missed it by one  marisha 
none	 did you say 55 that just dropped me by half my hit points  laura yeah basically me too more than half  matt thats going to end its turn vex youre up  travis least you fell in love before you died  laughter  laura is he within five feet can i get away from him  marisha fuck you travis  matt you would take an attack of opportunity if you do  one more rogue level  laura im going to hope that he doesnt hit me and im going to try and run away from 
none	 him  taliesin he has disadvantage  laura okay does he  taliesin yeah he has disadvantage on swinging at you  matt he does yes so as you start rushing away the one lax arm holding the cleaver goes cleaver  slamming and comes down over her head like a giant thick threeandahalffootwide blade of  solid iron with disadvantage thats 25 to hit  sam whoa this is a powerful fighter  laura he hits me watch me die right now  marisha hes right were not ready were stupid assholes oh god  travis were going to 
none	 do drugs in your lounges for the rest of our lives  laura if he kills me right now im going to be so pissed  matt you take 29 points of bludgeoning damage not bludgeoning sorry slashing damage as the  blade strikes down slicing right across your front torso nearly throwing you to the ground and  you can already feel the blood fill up in your mouth and begin to drip down the side of your  chin but you do manage to pull away from him where do you want to move  laura oh my 
none	 dear lord im going to run around behind the throne but im going to shoot him as  im doing it im going to shoot him from there and then im going to keep going but im going to  shoot him with hopefully the lightning actually does something because im going to shoot him  with the lightning arrow and im doing it at a fourth level  matt all right  laura so i roll attack as normal okay oh no shit what is that 22 22  matt 22 hits go ahead and roll damage on that 
none	 so its normally 4d8 but you did it at a higher  level so its 5d8 points of lightning damage  marisha wait why was it higher did you do it at a higher level  laura yeah  marisha okay okay  laura 19  matt 19 points of lightning damage the lightning streaks into it as the arrow hits and the  lightning begins arcing through its armor it bursts outwards keyleth i need you to make a  dexterity saving throw  laura oh shit keyleth im so sorry  sam why  matt because shes within 
none	 ten feet of the creature  marisha no its fine im good dexterity save  laura no its a fucking lightning arrow i never use it  marisha 11  matt 11 you take nine points of lightning no its 2d8 so you roll 2d8 damage  marisha does my spell resistance armor help with this ive got advantage  laura just eight little old points  marisha does my advantage from spell resistance on my armor help with this  matt it is technically a spell  marisha so can i roll again  matt go ahead and roll 
none	 again  marisha oh thats better 21  matt so yes you take half damage so take four points of lightning damage  laura yay see thats nothing  marisha feels good  laura now you feel alive  marisha yeah im awake  laura and im going to keep running and go behind the throne  matt thats as far as you can get at 30 feet  laura im going to stay right there  matt unless you want to run past this way counting you can get over there  laura okay sure  matt knowing you 
none	 and your movement situation you would have probably taken the more direct route  because you were going to get hit regardless  marisha so lightning radiated off of him  matt scanlan  sam so it did not hurt him at all  matt the lightning hurt him it arced through him and it seemed to react to the impact  laura hes metal hes made of metal  sam okay before i go because i wasnt in the room did jmon sa ord say this is a test  all yes  sam okay  travis he said 
none	 show me what you can do  marisha and taliesin show me what youve got  sam okay im out of range so he cant swipe me as i walk away right  matt as far as you know its a long blade  sam then ill stay put  matt you saw the blade slam down towards vex and it slammed a few inches away from you so youre  right on that maybemaybe not edge  sam lets not risk that so ill hand cone up otilukes resilient sphere to trap the beast  laura yes  marisha 
none	 go scanlan  matt let me pull this up real fast  laura please let this work  taliesin no its a good plan  laura its enough to heal up and get ready  matt a creature of object size large or smaller this is technically a huge creature  sam hes huge i thought you said he was 15 feet  matt 15 feet tall he himself is about 15 or so  sam groans dramatically  matt a medium creatures about six to seven feet average a large creature is about ten to 12  sam i 
none	 have perfectly huge balls  taliesin you have big balls not huge  sam theyre large or smaller  matt so as soon as you start casting the spell you look at the size and think this isnt going  to fit in one of my spheres  sam okay so i ditch that and because i saw lightning work im going to well then im going  to have to move can i hit him now without hitting keyleth or do i have to move for that  matt you can because hes wide enough you can go that 
none	 way  sam ill just lightning bolt then level three lightning bolt  matt all righty with advantage on its save that is a 16 dexterity saving throw  sam its a saving throw  matt yeah against your lightning bolt to see if it manages to dodge out of the way  sam does my cutting words affect that at all  matt no cutting words is to reduce the attack of another creature  sam no but because im armed with mythcarver when i use it my target gets disadvantage on his  next saving throw  matt 
none	 correct its saving throw is still a 16 your dc is way higher it failed  sam oh okay  matt this is a big creature its not very dexterous it cant dodge quickly its like  groaning its like a small moving tank  sam so 8d6 then  matt correct  sam 24  matt 24 points of lightning damage the bolt of energy arcs out from your finger passing keyleth  you shake from the nearby impact your body still a little numb from the previous electrical hit it  blasts the front as the arc from 
none	 vexs attack begins to wear off this time the energy coursing  through its entire body you can see as it tries to lift the blade up for another attack it almost  drops the blade from the impact but it stays firm and shrugs it off but you can see the darkened  period across its body where the electric bolts are beginning to take effect across its physical form  sam okay ill use that opportunity to back away and hope it doesnt get me  matt you back away and youre out of range for it to 
none	 try to make a strike at you you can keep  moving if you want  sam yeah ill go all the way to the wall  matt all the way to the wall  sam yeah but not the glass god whos coming up next i will inspire grog he hasnt happened yet right  laura yeah grogs coming up soon  sam i will inspire him with a hastily written limerick okay ready  kevdak had these terrible knuckles  they beat up on grog while he chuckled  but while kevin laughed  grog sliced him in 
dung	 half  and said these are mine now fuckles  laughter  matt those are all words that you can kind of understand so you take your inspiration dice  travis amazing  laura i like how his name was kevin halfway through the limerick  travis fuckles is that a d10 or a d12  matt d10 so thats the end of your turn  sam that is all i can do  matt all right keyleth youre up  marisha okay seeing that the lightning is doing some damage i am going to cast call lightning at  
none	 fourth level  matt okay  marisha im going to take a step back first actually  laura hell get a swipe at you  liam theres a five foot square  laura yeah this is true but at disadvantage he still got me at 25 before  liam yes but youre ten feet away though  marisha just five feet i want to shift back five feet  matt okay  marisha i can do that without getting a swipe right  matt hes already used his reaction to strike  marisha aw sick ill back it up a 
dung	 little bit more theres good no right theres fine yeah  and im going to cast call lightning fourth level  matt all right the very top and this chamber comes to this large domelike precipice at about  60 feet up upwards you see a skylight series of glass begins to fill with dark clouds swirling  as keyleths concentrating her eyes fog over white what are you going to do  marisha right on his head  matt as keyleth focuses she brings her arm down and one singular bolt coalesces strikes down  right onto his head 
none	 whats the dc on the spell  marisha 19  matt all right nope he rolled a 19 and failed hes got a minus one on his dex save hes a slow  guy so he takes 3d10 lightning damage go ahead and roll that  marisha 4d10 because i cast it at fourth level  matt thats right 4d10 because its fourth level  sam hes got 500 hit points  laura hes got so many  marisha three six not great eight so make that whats six plus eight 14 plus five 19  points of lightning damage 
none	  matt 19 points of lightning damage strikes into its head and you see it has to fall back onto its  back leg to right itself and its growling sounds like creaking of metal and stone against each  other  marisha and with that im going to use my free action to go earth elemental form  matt bonus action you mean  marisha yes  travis my free action  laura is that what you said my free action yeah  marisha did i sound like mickey did that happen  liam mickey mouse voice id like 
none	 to use my bonus action to go earth elemental  matt as the growling sound of stone and metal seems to vibrate the floor you step back and hulk  out into your elemental form almost returning a similar earthagainststone growl back at it  liam there she is  matt top of the round vax youre up  liam would you allow me to use my bonus action to go stealth and quietly run over using my hasted  speed to get over to my sister behind that stone thingy in the middle of the room  matt you 
none	 could certainly try  liam yes id like to try  matt four five six one get behind there go ahead and roll a stealth check  liam okay ill use my last luck of the day though fine 29  matt okay far as you know it doesnt see  liam okay id like to curve around by my sister and use sharpshooter to throw two daggers as hard  as i can at him  laura what why are you going to  liam thats what i want to do  laura no hes going to aim at 
none	 me  liam first one is a 26 25 and the second one misses its a natural one with sharpshooter oh  no 26 21  matt all right these are with which blades  liam this is with dagger of venom and flame tongue so the flame missed dagger hit excuse  me venom hit  matt right okay so you throw go ahead and roll damage for the dagger of venom  liam is it a sneak attack  matt he does not seem to see you so yes you are rolling damage  liam all right so 
none	 its plus ten because i used sharpshooter so one seven plus ten is 17 thats  the 20 23 27 32 37 40  matt 40 nice 40 points of piercing damage as this one dagger hits one of its front chest plates  and causes it to dislodge and hang to the side and its hanging by some sort of interior bolted  circumstance you can see a bunch of iron mechanisms that are holding it together some  almost clockwork some appear to be arcane in nature and are being held aloft by sparking  whitishblue energy  
none	 liam do i have five feet of movement left  matt you have about 15 feet of movement  liam im going to slink right behind the thing so im out of range  laura yeah good good job thanks so you hit him and he looks over and im standing there its  the best thats the best move ever  liam i didnt hear any of that  laura im right behind you you did hear it  liam that was longer than six seconds  matt end of vaxs turn percy youre up  taliesin okay i 
none	 can see the damage that this thing has taken would it be possible to target  the wound id be happy to burn a grit to target the mechanisms and not the armor try and get a  chunk of metal in there  matt sure  taliesin okay first thing im going to do is im going to take a couple steps to the right and try  and shove my elbow on that glass to see what it feels like  matt okay so you step by and its a pretty thick pane about maybe an inch or 
none	 so thick it has very  faint glasscut carvings and designs into it mainly geometric vines that curl on themselves  its a really pretty display for the brief moment that you glance out the corner of your eye at it  taliesin i just wanted to see how strong it felt  matt pretty strong  taliesin okay like highrise glass  matt yeah  taliesin okay im going to pull the rest of my movement the opposite direction  marisha yeah dont stand in front of a window  taliesin yeah i dont want to be in front 
none	 of a window im going to pull out bad news and im  going to take a targeted shot at these mechanisms with the big gun i obviously cant do a trick  shot because im shooting at a thing obviously that would not work  marisha obviously obvs  taliesin spend a deadeye shot for it and im going to do a sharpshooter and im burning grit  here we go didnt need that grit but fuck it nope rolled 18 on both so 25 to hit  matt 25 hits  taliesin you can borrow the die 25 
dung	 hits oh boy this is fun come on where am i d12s and a d6  thats a highpitched giggling im a pretty pretty princess 21 31 37 37 points of  piercing damage and five points of necrotic  matt okay  liam you sir have the temperament of a yalie gun firing  matt as you fire bad news you can see the smoke and dark mist that fires at the front of its  barrel from the hex the heavy bullet goes into the opening in the chest that was given by grog  and you hear 
none	 it bouncing around inside seemingly not really doing any damage to the interior of the  creature  laura come on  liam still wellaimed  taliesin i reload  sam and shoot yourself in the face  taliesin fuck it i am aquaman in this fight im well aware  liam take that sword out man  taliesin im going to burn another grit oh yeah no i am but im trying to be helpful in  the moment  matt so you fire reload and for your  taliesin this is my third and final shot im going

none	 enlarge to grow to incredible size  liam do you see me angel guy  sam to ridiculous size  matt as you rush forward towards it you slam your gauntlets together as you get towards it you  begin to swell in size your strides getting longer and longer by the time you approach it  you are right there you are now one size category larger  travis mighty joe young bitch  laura push him out the window grog  matt all righty so you are attempting to make a shove attack okay you push it away 
none	 from you  travis yes a strength check against either his strength or dexterity its the targets choice  taliesin he also has disadvantage on strength checks  laura so hes going to choose dexterity  matt nope his dexterity is fucking awful so you go ahead and make an athletics check  travis yes which i get advantage on 23  matt 23 with disadvantage its 19  laura yes how far can you throw him  travis only five feet or knock him prone  laura knock him prone  sam i dont know  travis yeah id

dung	 room the silks all swirling  entangling around you the wind slowly dies down suddenly and unnaturally so you glance over the  balcony and what was once empty you see a dark figure standing silhouetted by the outside  sunlight tall thin lithe figure this appears to be jmon sa ord reappearing who walks inside  hands together and an expression of amusement says impressive indeed very well you will have  my alliance and allegiance for the coming storm the door behind you where you guys entered up  inside opens and you see the grand maven step

none	 i have my ways which i utilize only when necessary now what you ask  what you do is already a deed of justice in and of itself i require no recompense beyond that  while i cannot leave my city unguarded for long i must remain until you are prepared to engage this  thordak head on when the time comes call to me and i will come to your aid and they raise  their finger and does a small snapping motion you watch as the throne itself lifts up and shifts off  of its place a 
none	 chest beneath it opens suddenly and the wind whips up once more throughout the  room and as it does a small thin extended rodlike object floats and is tossed in the air by  the wind over in the direction of jmon sa ord who then snatches it and the wind ceases once more  presents it toward  sam ill take that please  matt you take it looking at it its a small brass flute looks simple like a penny whistle  almost as youre about to blow on it jmon puts their hand up and says 
none	 it knows the melody to  call devossa but once  sam to call who  matt devossa  sam is that a name that you go by  matt devossa is the guardian of this city jmon stands back and slowly extends their arms as  a sudden burst of wind once again fills the room swirling around sending the silks tangling about  once more seeming stronger than what was brought in from the shattered window earlier your hair is  being tossed and you watch as the lithe creature steps back the shape bending and swelling behind 
dung	  the silks passing in front as it backs up toward the opposite side of the chamber on the outside of  the balcony you watch the flashing of color of green and dark gold a shadow takes the floors  the new form before you holds most of the room lording over the throne heavy footsteps wings  whooshing noise unfurl as you see before you the form of the citys protector a massive brass  dragon scales glistening in the windowfractured sunlight wings and tail tip becoming a gradient  into green at the end incredible frightening beautiful 
none	 the dragons head curls down over  where the throne was moved their head massive by comparison to you and reminiscent of most of your  recent dragon fights though there is almost a smile and benevolence to their presence the same  black eyes with a smoldering molten pupil still stand there staring back at you i share with  you my secret there is now trust between you and i do not forsake it  laura never  taliesin this is a greater gift than we could have hoped for  matt heavy footsteps they sit back into 
none	 a more casual position their claws still there before  them head still level with the rest of your party it slowly drifts back up now looming down  over 30 feet ahead of you the voice booms out once more i will prepare here how i can now go  time is ever fleeting  laura when we call your guardian is that how youll know that were calling you as well  matt i am the guardian  laura i get it im really smart  sam she lost a lot of blood  laura coughs also like

none	 that perhaps even such a thing would make us even more of a target  perhaps  matt the dragon leans forward the head coming down straight to you their maw right across from  your size one of their front teeth is about up to your waist by comparison heavy breathing  chuckles you are sly gnome turns around and reaches into the same box that carried  the flute pulls out a chain that dangles fluttering in the wind and hands it to you  marisha its a fourday comiccon badge  sam oh professional  matt only 
none	 one day  sam sunday motherfucker  laughter  matt the chain as you grasp it its dropped into your hand and you look at it there appears  to be a brass emblem with a single circular sapphire set into it this is a symbol of my  crest few should argue should they be under my sway  sam thank you so much and i drop six inches which is to my knee and bow my head in  supplication  travis scanlan beepbeep beepbeep  laura he means be pleased  sam oh be pleased  taliesin

none	 to rest once again as it opens  there standing in the space is the cobalt golem eyes flickering with white flame  footsteps it comes rushing forward past you shouldering you out of the way grabs its blade  you can see there are dents in its armor but its still standing apparently didnt seem to take  that much damage from the impact of the fall it takes the blade and drags it behind it as it moves  around jmon who steps back as the golem goes back under the balcony and then begins to climb back 
none	 up  outside to whatever strange device or platform it was affixed to before it dropped  laura sick  taliesin marvelous piece of engineering  matt we have many throughout the palace  taliesin your technology is impressive your craftsmanship beyond anything i have ever seen  and there is nothing more pleasing than a monarch with a sense of humor bless you  matt my patience for your honeyed words grows thin  laughter  taliesin oh that felt good  travis that was so good too  matt now be on your way i suspect when the 
none	 time comes to call me youd best be ready now  turns around and with a whirl the wind picks up again and the form shrinks down leaving once  again in the space as the shadow shrinks the lithe form of jmon sa ord they walk back to the  throne as the throne seems to magically lift up and cover the box that was there beneath it  before sits back on the throne crosses their knees onto the throne leans on one side of the  armrest  travis should we ask how to tell if someone

none	 many points throughout the structure it looks to  be three stories in its entirety a halfdozen armed guards not adorned in the guise of the hands  of ord stand at each entrance probably privately owned by the establishment and you hear loud  music and cheering bursting from within you catch a chiseled signed across each doorway arch that  read drensala quan lucks run  laura what does that mean  marisha rensala quan  matt drensala quan which is the marquesian speak for lucks run with the common translation  beneath it  laura okay i 
town	 understand  matt so as you at your own paces walk through the front doors the scents of sweat perfumes and  tobacco immediately hit your nostrils as the lively melodies of two musical groups compete from  across the establishment forming a strange discordant sound towards the center of the main  room large square tables draped in crimson cloth fill the space from one end to the other  different shapes and sizes crowds of different numbers huddled around each you see three dozen  patrons of all walks of life tending to their various games of chance 
dung	 card tables dice games  even a small contained race table in the far corner stir cheers and anguish you see  servants  marisha no wait what are they racing i go over to there  laura already im looking for craps  matt servants dressed in uniformed long shirts of dark gray and gold to match the buildings  exterior rush drinks food and coin between tables as you begin to push through the crowd you  come upon keyleth first as you push past to the far room there is a long table with a series  
town	 of curved almost miniature mazelike paths and there are five paths that all run alongside each  other as you glance over the crowd you see five desert lizards about that long that are all being  held in cages at one end and you see a bunch of individuals that are currently in the process of  setting bets down on the central table with a number of colored squares around it theyre  putting different amounts stacked up on the side and theyre all speaking in a language you dont  understand as you approach and glance over 
none	 some of them stop and glance over their shoulder at  you and then go back about their business not paying attention  marisha theyre doing their own thing okay how far away am i from the lizards  matt about seven feet  marisha can i go up to them or are they behind a gate  matt theyre all in these very wellcrafted cages sidebyside at the far end of a table right next  to where all the bets are being placed and there look to be two guards flanking them and one man at  the 
none	 very end of the table that currently looks to have his hand on a single doorway that is at the  front of these cages and is in the process of currently counting up and keeping track of all the  best that are being placed  marisha okay im going to go up to the guy  matt okay you walk up to him speaking in marquesian  taliesin well keep a couple feet behind  matt hes writing little notes checking on the lizards making little notes and as you walk up  he looks at you yes 
none	 may i help you  marisha yes be pleased  matt be pleased  marisha what are these magnificent creatures youre racing  matt have you not played this before  marisha no im a tourist so im brand new  matt this is my surprised face this is quan a drensal or the run of luck it is a traditional  old marquet game of chance its what the casino is partially named after it was founded on this  particular sport if you will people bet on which lizard reaches the end first then the people who  
none	 choose correctly make a profit the second makes half back what was bet the rest lose all to the house  marisha is it possible for me to get a closer look at the specimens you are racing  matt why  marisha im a purveyor of fabulous beasts and i just want to see these fabulous creatures youre  raising and racing  matt make a persuasion check  marisha god damn it this is not what im good at  taliesin nope  marisha ten  matt he goes if you wish to put down enough money to

none	 fascinating name where did that one come from  matt it came from the stupid bastard that attacked this city hundreds of years ago  marisha oh wow yeah no i was just wondering if there was any correlation  sam always bid on thordak  matt because its a tiny puny piece of shit lizard of course it is  marisha can i get a closer look at them  matt which one are you betting on  marisha i would like to get a closer look at them before i decide on where to put my wellearned  
none	 money  matt he stands back and the two guards muscle a little closer as he goes have a look and you lean  forward and glance across the front of the cages they all have this reddishyellow sandtype scaled  exterior darker at the top and lighter on the underbelly and theyre all pretty much the same  size age may differ you cant really tell which ones are healthy or not from this distance what  are you looking for  marisha how close are the guys to me  matt to you there a like foot from 
none	 you maybe theyre both being very careful theyre watching  you very closely  taliesin im going to engage the man in a bit of conversation so is it a straight bet across or  are there competing numbers based on historical averages for these creatures at this point where  is the money going at the moment  matt the money right now we have currently a total of 750 gold pieces placed in total on the  rul who has apparently been doing very well for the day sonpa has been failing miserably but it  might be 
none	 the underdog who knows theyre all in equal health and the variations can be plenty  wendis is okay thordak has characteristically no votes devossa has a decent amount it is up to you  what do you wish  marisha while theyre having this conversation im going to lean into the lizards and cast speak  with animals  matt all right go ahead and make a sleight of hand check  marisha very under my breath  sam getting tossed from the casino  marisha here we go again  matt well lets have a look at speak

none	 various druidic incantations and as your fingers begin to  manipulate the spectrums of divine energies in your hand a giant meaty arm claps down on your hand  and pulls you to the side and the guard pulls you off your feet at his face excuse me are you  trying to do funny business  marisha im very bad at funny you talk to other people in our group for funny  taliesin im ignoring this  matt you are out of the run and the other gentleman grabs your shoulder and they begin  pushing you out 
town	 towards the exit of the lucks run  marisha oh dont come on man look  matt anybody do anything  travis nope  matt all right as youre conversing with this gentleman you watch as keyleth gets pushed very  forcefully towards the back door on the opposite side of the chamber and kicked out onto the  street like full on boottotheass about a three foot arc before slamming onto the dark red  cobblestone streets of the suncut bazaar  marisha you guys i just got kicked out of a casino im so cool im cool scanlan

none	 they come rushing back on the opposite side of the table people are  shouting one gentleman to the left of you vex seems to have some large cigartype thing and is  blustering out smoke in your vicinity making you cough a bit but youre still focused on this you  watch as rul pulls ahead thordak pulls ahead and pulls back sonpa pushes forward and wendis is  falling behind devossa gets close and barely scoots past and devossa is the winner  laura do i get anything for second place  matt second place you get back 
dung	 half of what you bet so you get 13 gold pieces back you lose your  bet a few other gentlemen seem to be happy and collect their winnings and far more seem to be  disappointed with the outcome some leave a few more fill the spaces and come back around the run  of luck is complete  liam whats it like outside  marisha whispers whats it like outside  matt its dark but beautiful with the various lanterns that are now lit theres carts being  pulled by some folks are leaving for the evening some

none	 competitive card game  between a group of card players at a table that actually has a buy in but can raise per round  back and forth based on who drops out and who doesnt there is a dice game called avandras  favor that involves you actually rolling 2d6 and if you get either a seven or a 12 you win but  you can double the bet to add an additional d6 to try and get either a seven or a  12 if the numbers dont quite meet one or the other  sam go there 
none	  taliesin were going there  matt so you go to the dice game  laura yeah  matt so you go to the avandras favor tables  laura i want to use my gold dice  matt so you have to wait a moment as there is a small line of people queued up to go ahead and  place their bets for the dice each person is betting on each individual as they go in whether  or not theyre going to make it you wait for about 15 or so minutes before you watch a couple  
none	 folks lose horribly and walk away very sorrowful about how much they lost in trying to  push their luck as they step away and its finally your turn and the woman whos currently helping  this table goes and you miss you are here to play  laura this game  matt yes avandras favor  laura yes that  matt all right so what is your initial bet my dear  laura i cant actually remember what you said the rules were so whats the minimum bet  matt 25 gold pieces  laura okay  taliesin how

dung	 dont  matt about 20 minutes of this as youre watching over and some folks look down expecting to see a  child are spooked by it in your time here youve only really come across maybe two other  gnomes theyre not very prominent here in ankharel as a people so some folks give you an  odd look to the side a sideways glance as you step around at one point you do feel one hand  clasp onto your shoulder you glance up and you see a nice billowing dark blue silk shirt across  a halforc 
none	 gentleman with his hair slicked back short over the edge of his scalp he has a really  welltrimmed goatee and a very big hoop gold earring in one ear his hand is wrapped around  your shoulder and he goes so verdaven said we are to speak yes  sam maybe  matt well then follow me to more private quarters where we can have a conversation  sam lead the way  matt he releases your shoulder and begins walking up the stairs to the second floor  sam ill join him  matt all right  laura 
none	 did we see him walking up the stairs  matt make a perception check  taliesin ill join in that perception check  matt you kept your eye the whole time that was your goal so you see this happen  marisha guys get me a drink  taliesin 21  laura 15  matt okay so yeah percy vax and vex all three of you see scanlan led upstairs trailing  behind this welldressed halforc individual  marisha if they have a chardonnay  taliesin i was going to go red  marisha that works a shiraz would be 
none	 phenomenal  matt you guys following or are you staying where you are  liam these stairs are peopled or are they empty other than scanlan and this other guy  matt occasional foot traffic up and down there does appear to be one of the various hired  ruffians to keep the peace around this vicinity at the landing up where the stairs stop and then  head further up  laura is the gambling only at the first level or is it up higher levels as well  matt you havent been to the second floor  laura 
none	 i think ill after a little bit grab a drink and then  taliesin drunkenly head up  laura yeah  matt okay so you guys head to get a drink  liam can i ride my 20 up the stairs  matt id say at this point because youre no longer hiding in a corner youre actually  entering a social place youll have to go ahead and roll another stealth check  liam thats fine 31  matt okay so as opposed to just being out of sight you are trained in the idea of blending in  
town	 making various subtle movements to not catch anyones attention and to match the energy of the  room about you so as to not stand out amongst the crowd you adjust some of your clothing to match  some of the shouldertossed shawls that some of the folks in here wear and you naturally fall  into the general atmosphere of the casino  liam im still wearing the fancy whites that percival put over me the other day  matt not a worry you follow up the stairs and up top you do see there are a couple more 
none	 tables in a  center room and six doors on each side of this long run before another staircase heads up to the  third floor of this establishment the halforc walks to the fourth door on the left pulls out a  key pulls the door open glances over his shoulder for a second and enters the room  sam i will gladly follow  matt as you turn the corner and enter the room there is a singular table there are two chairs  facing each other there appears to be some small  mooing in music track 
none	  taliesin theres an ox in the corner  liam you can do anything you want in this place  taliesin how much for ten minutes with the ox be fair  matt as you enter the room you see there are a few tables on the far side there is a window that  looks out that is currently closed and the halforc is now standing on the opposite side of  the table  sam clears throat so what have you got for me  matt you enter and sit down  sam oh yes i enter and 
none	 sit down  matt okay you sit down as you sit down the door closes behind you and you see the halfelf that  you had met earlier in the alleyway was behind the door walks around and leaves the room closing  the door behind him you hear lock clicking the halforc has sat down and goes so you were  asking about spice  sam again maybe  matt specifically if i am to understand 200 gold worth of fusaka  sam maybe more if its of a higher quality  matt well let it be known that 
none	 i brought just in case twice the amount he reaches off to the  side and opens one of the small cupboards thats part of the table arrangement on that side of the  room and pulls out two satchels that are about that big around each and lifts them both one  after the other onto the table they are tied at the very top its a highquality burlaptype  material on the outside only the weave is much tighter so its not liable to leak or stumble out  so it is difficult to acquire this i would 
none	 say one for 250 or both for 400 gold  sam how do i know its of a quality im accustomed to from my homeland  matt because i have a reputation to uphold if you wish not to have any perhaps you find  business with less viable options  sam forgive me im not from around here i dont know of your reputation could i possibly have a  sample to see  matt make a persuasion check  liam while hes doing that im pretending to sort of drunkenly lean on the wall outside that door  
none	 taliesin did that just happen  laura what was it  sam 20  yelling  matt all right as you glance and look around the side you can see a tanskinned halfelf in robes  waiting impatiently with his back against the door that you barely saw scanlan disappear into after  he walked out he gives you a look over should you wish but be careful not to inhale too  deeply then he takes the rope and unfurls and unties it takes the satchel and pushes it over  towards you  sam the whole satchel  
none	 matt the entire satchel  travis do you know if its a powder or a plant  liam its the cinnamon challenge  laura what does it look like  sam yeah what does it look like  matt well its halfway across the table you go ahead and pull it towards you  sam oh ill pull it towards me yeah  matt its a little heavier than you expected its not a light thing its a very heavy  material as you pull it forward it looks like very very finely mulched bark almost or  shavings and 
none	 it has this pungent smell like dried cheese with a hint of cedar  sam what is this shit its not a fine powder its chunky  matt its chunky to an extent and as youre looking over it he goes it requires additional  refining for use of course  sam of course this isnt my first rodeo friend  travis put it in your lip put it in your lip  sam being that i play stringed instruments i have long nails so ill take my pinky and sort of  dip down and get a little on 
none	 the end of my pinky smell it a bit on my gums a little bit  taliesin sweet christmas  laura the cedar wood chips  matt the smell is strong and the taste is stronger it is not pleasant to the tongue the  aftertaste does have a unique zest to it there is a slight numbness and while the initial flavor is  awful the lingering flavor is actually quite nice like a spiced meat almost it catches you  off guard  sam spiced meat am i feeling high at all  matt make a constitution check 
none	  marisha how fast is your metabolism  sam constitution check ive never checked my constitution   matt saving throw  sam saving throw well either way its 16  matt 16 okay best you can tell theres no immediate effect you dont know what its  supposed to do it doesnt seem to be having an effect on you at the moment  sam ill do a little bit more get it on my tongue  travis up the nose  sam sniffing just a little bit more to see if its doing anything  matt make another 
none	 constitution saving throw  sam 16  matt still seemingly no effect and you can see the halforc is starting to get a little impatient  and frustrated so you have tried of the wares are you satisfied  sam im not dead i guess thats good you know where im from sometimes we burn it and inhale it  that way is that done what methods do you guys use here  matt his head pulls back a bit and he goes you may do as you wish with it upon purchasing that  is up to you i 
none	 am a little worried that you may not be regulating your intake  sam dont worry about me friend all right my mom and dad thats their job all right all  right i guess ill take it your reputation and the seeming good quality makes me believe that  this is of a fine caliber quality how thats ugh stings a little in the eyes thats all  matt that it would  sam for two satchels like this why dont we say 300  matt his immediate eager lean forward slips back into an armscrossed 400 was already 
none	 a discount  sam fair enough 400 it is  matt 400 he takes the other satchel and is about to push it forward and is seemingly waiting  sam for me to pay him sure ill drop four hundred large  matt okay  sam four hundred thousand dollars  matt as you both wait a moment and pause you both shove it across at the same time and he  catches the coin pouch after watching you count it across the table both your satchels are at your  disposal he goes it has been a pleasure doing 
none	 business with you if its not too much to ask in  case you require further assistance what shall i call you  sam you can call me the meat man  snorting and giggling  matt the meat man i hope to do more business with you in the future meat man  sam and what shall i call you  matt i have a few titles but in these circles you may call me rutur  sam rutur  matt rutur  sam rutur and so im clear here this is a drug right  matt of course 
none	 it is  sam oh really im not feeling it yet do i need to do more of it is that the thing  matt it does not affect you immediately  sam oh it doesnt  all oh shit  sam all right great thanks bye  matt he takes his coin gets up walks around the table knocks on the door a couple knocks it  opens the halfelf peers through the door opens completely he stops as you say that  sam sorry ive got two big bags of drugs could you give me a backpack or 
none	 something to put this  in i mean i cant walk out of the casino holding this  matt the halforc rolls his eyes looks over to the halfelf and goes speaking marquesian the  other one turns sighs ill be right back and he goes to one of the other rooms in 30 seconds  he comes back with some sort of a backpacktype ensemble and tosses it to you you catch it now  should you need more just ask around the bazaar and they both quickly head down the stairs past you  sam as they go 
dung	 i say to them remember we met but you did not meet the meat man  matt they both stop on their step and look at each other and keep walking they exit the casino  and you have your satchel  sam okay breathing heavily i hyperventilate for a second i dont know whats going on where  are you guys where are you guys  liam i place my hand right on his shoulder  sam yells in surprise its not me its not theyre not mine and i throw it across the room  liam i catch 
none	 it grab him by the scruff of the shirt and start leading him back down the stairs  what the fuck is wrong with you  sam dont say anything ive got lots of drugs  liam why are your eyes all bloodshot whats the matter with you  sam i dont know what i did  liam is it this  sam maybe it hasnt affected me yet  taliesin no no what are you doing  matt make a constitution saving throw  laura oh you rolled really well  liam i rolled good yeah 19  matt

none	 your  shoulders  taliesin ugh no slapping no dont slap  liam i walk over to scanlan and i squat down and i start playdohing his face in all different  shapes pulling the cheeks out really wide pulling the nose up as  laura we should get him to bed  liam if only i had scotch tape  travis so like should we sleep because i know we still wanted to see headmaster james kryon at  the crystal chateau  taliesin yes lets get an evenings sleep  liam yeah and we need to fix scanlan 
none	 before  travis maybe he needs to be slapped sober  laura were still waiting to hear back on mistress asharru  taliesin yes we are still waiting on that  laura yes so we cant leave here  travis mister ashad  laura the one with the cloak  taliesin and we have several magical items that could use a little bit of jiggerypokery so lets  sleep this off perhaps and be excited that were bringing a friend a taste of home at the bargain  of 50 gold  laura but i have to say im glad 
none	 jarett didnt send us on a mission to get drugs its quite out  of character  taliesin i mean you know  sam inarticulate noise  liam ive got my pinkies in the sides of scanlans mouth  laura leave him alone hes pathetic enough as it is really  sam sobbing  travis all right im going to bed  laura yeah  matt all right you guys find yourselves to your respective rooms  sam thickly be pleased  matt you all have a full nights rest back to full hit points you get half your maximum 
town	 hit  dice back if youve spent any more than half of them scanlan you wake up quite a pounding  headache in your head but the rest of your body has its feeling back as you come to  consciousness  sam maybe i can package it into smaller amounts and sell it on the street to recoup some of the  money do we have an afternoon to kill  travis are you talking to yourself  sam yes damn it what did i do i should have insight checked him or i couldve dominated  there are 
tavern	 so many things i could have done to him to find out i flew too close to the sun  laughter  sam sighs next time next time ill do things differently next time i will find drugs thats  the lesson to be taken from this look harder look harder the meat man never gives up  taliesin i believe in you walter white i believe in you  matt and another persona of scanlan was born all righty so what are your plans for the day as you  stumble down into the main tavern area you can 
tavern	 see treevs barely conscious himself and a few  other patrons are waiting eagerly for their food as a few of the various barkeep assistants are  bringing out breakfasts and meals youll want food on your way out then  laura yes please  taliesin and whatever you have for a hangover for our friend wholl be down in oh never quite  possibly  matt hair of the dog it is  taliesin i think he may have had the whole dog  travis we thought we might be going to the crystal chateau today anything to know 
tavern	 about  heading that direction  cricket sounds  travis crickets in this tavern  matt ah get rid of them well other than the fact that theyre a bunch of stuffy folk and  generally not really considered classic traditional ankharel i mean good luck getting a  right answer out of anyone  travis they snobs or are they like shifty  matt snobs of the highest order at least from what ive seen allegiance of allsight and all that  taliesin i love snobs im excited  laura any word back from mistress asharru  matt nope 
none	 no word who knows how long itll take she might not even like it you may never  hear back from her in which case if you wait long enough i can see if i can hire someone else  for you  laura yeah thank you  taliesin we have business we can see to it lets take everything that we need we have  several objects if i recall  travis yep shall we  laura scarf down the breakfast  matt you get your food in your system  taliesin were going to actually need a scanlan 
none	  laura how you doing scan  sam i wander down sighs good morning all i hope you slept nicely my jaw seems to work thank  you for not nursing me at all last night i wouldve done the same to you  taliesin loudly how are you feeling  sam aw fuck you  laughter  liam aw i feel so bad i walk up behind him and i start doing like a scalp massage around the  temples youll be all right eat something okay  sam all right something with meat i need to use this 
none	 spice  marisha i make a little bit of my glissfoil hangover tonic give it to him  matt it helps the next 15 minutes or so of you finishing your breakfast the headache fades for  the most part the pounding subsides  sam the innkeeper knew of the spice correct can i talk to the innkeeper really quick  matt sure you walk up to treev whos right now sitting there reading a book has like a rather  thick pair of glasses that look rather hilarious against the small dragonborn eyes focus against  the really rough 
none	 and tumble exterior  sam oy treev that fusaka spice how much does it go for usually for a bag big bag sack  matt how big a bag are you talking  sam hogs head right  taliesin yeah its a hogs head  matt hogs head bag it depends on where youre buying it ten gold  groaning and laughter  matt but you could probably barter most down from there if youre getting it in bulk  sam that hurts i thought you people said it was expensive  matt for spice yeah mostly dealing with coppers 
none	 and silvers for mere poison food flavor  sam what if its really high quality fusaka  matt 12 fusakas fusaka and you dont find many folks thatre asking for its flavor except for  particular dishes so i only keep maybe a small flagon of it at any times in fact last night is  the first time someone asked for it in about three months  laura what does it normally look like  marisha no one even fucking wants it  laura i mean when youre using it in food  matt well it comes and he 
dung	 goes through like a small spice rack on the side of the kitchen  comes back out and pulls out a small glass container he uncorks the top and inside you can  see its a very fine dark brown powder he says it comes in bits but you grind it down and then  you sprinkle it over cook it proper usually with slow roasts and its quite nice  sam thanks treev  matt no worries  sam all right im good  liam enjoy that allspice  sam lets go on our journey  travis we buying 
none	 more drugs today  sam no i think my kingpin days are over  liam that is sad to hear  travis off to the crystal chateau then  taliesin off to the crystal chateau  matt whos leading the charge to the crystal chateau  marisha we ask treev first where is the crystal chateau  matt he thinks for a second aint been around those areas for a bit thosell be over in the  sigil district and thats right down in the southeastern side of ankharel look for the  raised landmass where its carved off at 
none	 the top thats where most of all the bastards live and  most of the trainings done by the allegiance folk  liam the bastards live you said  travis yeah theyre snobby  laura thank you  matt my pleasure  taliesin be back in a bit  travis meepmeep  taliesin ill lead the charge  matt all right make an investigation check  taliesin oh for the love of god  laura are you finding anything percy  taliesin no six  matt six whatd you roll  taliesin two  matt at least its not a 
town	 one it takes you about four hours of wandering the city to finally get  the proper directions to lead you towards the sigil district to the crystal chateau as you  ascend through these streets the red cobblestone that youve seen through most of the streets of  ankharel gives way to this slightly opalescent surface where the light itself almost dances  across the surface of the stones it shifts in the outskirts of where the large hillside comes to an  end and the buildings here give way to an open space where you see a large 
none	 open square but in  the center of the square there are ropes around some sort of large hole in the ground probably a  good 150 feet across it is a circular chasm off to the eastern side of this large open square  there are maybe a half dozen individuals standing around the lip of it a few of them are armed and  armored and a few of them seem to be dressed in long relatively nice robes and light clothing  you see a number of longhouses with high steepled roofs with a yellowishtan tint to 
town	 them these  buildings are very nice they look constructed in a type of architecture thats more reminiscent of  taldorei or other civilizations than youve seen most of ankharels construction so you figure  these buildings are probably newer or at least this district seems to have a little different  cultural flavor to it than the rest of the city to the southern side of it you do see a large  multitiered structure that is made of a smoky quartz mixed with white marble in places this  with an immediate glance youd probably gather is the 
town	 crystal chateau  taliesin does the opalescent stone have any similarity to the stones of whitestone  matt make an investigation check  marisha dont use the opalite dice opalite hates us  taliesin there we go 23  matt you take a moment glance down closely and look at it it looks like the cobblestones of this  particular district and its only really towards the top of this hill where all the rest of these  buildings are constructed has a very faint trace of groundin whitestone particles that had  been part of the construct of these 
town	 floors a large portion of whitestone over time has been  exported to this location for the construction of the top of this hill  taliesin good to know  laura can i wander over to the big hole in the ground and ask one of the guards oi whats in there  matt as soon as you walk up two of the guards give you a keen look and put their hands on the  sides of their sheathed weapons  laura no worries im from out of town i just was very curious  matt they look at 
none	 each other and some of the more for lack of a better term more academic  looking individuals shy away from this seemingly growing possible confrontation from their  perspective they begin to pull back and walk down this slightly descending spirallike path thats  about ten feet off the inside of this carving into the floor they begin to descend down into it one  of the guards says this is where the allegiance is currently excavating  laura oh and the allegiance is the people who live here no  matt the allegiance runs all of the schools 
none	 here  laura of course yes the schools for magic  matt you are not from here  laura i am not at all  matt well please be on your way  laura right thank you for all of your helpfuw information helpfuw helpful  matt as you walk and turn away they keep a close eye as you step back into the open area of the square  laura theres a big hole in the ground  taliesin i was noticing thats odd  laura theyre escexcavating something i dont know whats happening to my brain  taliesin 
none	 had a little bit of spice have we  marisha does it look like a similar excavation site to the ziggurat in whitestone  matt the ziggurat is a subterranean chamber that was found through a long series of tunnels that  were carved beneath a long swath of land underneath whitestone castle to the actual city  of whitestone this appears to be just a large strip minelike cylinder that descends deep into  the earth you havent been able to get close enough to look down toward the bottom of it  taliesin how wide again approximately  
dung	 matt about 150 feet across youre estimating from this distance  taliesin and it looks excavated and not just like something opened up and then they kept  digging  matt correct you can see there is actually a pattern to the carving of the earth it looks like  its been carved in layer after layer after layer much like a smallscale strip mine  taliesin do the stones look like they broke the ground or does it look like the stones were  actually built around this has this been here since the construction of this area or 
none	 does it  seem like perhaps in the last 20 years or such theyve just gone down  matt make an investigation check  taliesin no its a hole  matt yeah its hard to tell for all your training in whitestone you havent really been  too keen on reading about the various details and specifications behind paving roads  marisha percy  taliesin yes  marisha is there whitestone located outside of whitestone  taliesin not really that im aware of it rests beneath the tree in the hills in the mines to  the north and thats 
none	 pretty much it that im aware of  liam and you would know about any dealings that whitestone would have  taliesin well i would if i had paid attention to such things but it wasnt something that i was  i was very young the last time i was there i dont really know where anything went but i can  assume that this came from whitestone  travis i bet they got this from whitestone  liam thats a bit of a stretch grog  taliesin this is interesting how did you come to that conclusion  travis 
none	 i dont know i just felt a little brain snap and then things danced between my ears and  then it hit my mouth  taliesin you should write that down  marisha i druidcraft a little gold star for him out of bark and i say here you go grog good  job you have a gold star for the day  travis what do i do with this  marisha just stick it right on your forehead  liam or eat it  matt you hear a crunching between his pearly white largerthanaverage goliath teeth  taliesin this 
none	 is good news if it is whitestone it means that we at least have some leverage here  lets find a big door the biggest door we can find and attack it  matt thats always worked out well for you guys in the past you make your way south of the square  to the crystal chateau there is a large white iron gate that surrounds the premises  and from where the cobblestone  ends beyond that gate  it is a fairly beautiful wellkept fencedoff garden where you see some trees popping up green  grass looks 
none	 to be a small stream that runs through theres a bridge off the main path that leads to  the chateau that goes over it the water seems to butt up against the chateau and vanish beneath it to  continue within the actual structure  as you head to the front gate you see the door there and there are two small handles on the  outside you go to pull and it doesnt open  taliesin i knock  matt its that ironlike vibration of a heavy gate you wait a few moments and in the distance  
none	 you see the large two doors to the chateau one peeks open slightly and a little head peeks through  taliesin hello  matt its about maybe 50 feet from you at this distance and he disappears back behind the door  laura scanlan hold up that necklace  sam yes sorry distracted here  taliesin were here on official business matters of trade and of research  matt the door still remains ajar but the figure has pulled back in are you shouting this at a  distance  taliesin yes i am it will be very worth your 
none	 while and someone will definitely wish to speak  with us weve traveled from taldorei  sam can we just walk up to the door  matt the head peeks out again and you get a better look at it this time its short oval to  the side almost the head has this very wide short stocky very pointed nose and a very  pointed chin no facial hair however bald on top and what you see as a bit of grey hair thats  frizzed on the sides as it steps outside you see its stature is similar 
none	 to scanlans this appears  to be a gnomish individual pale skin paler than most of you and definitely most people youve seen  here in ankharel and as it steps out it has white robes with gray streaks across the front and  back that fall into this cape in the back and with its arms placed within its robes its small  footfalls comes across the path over the bridge up to the front of the gate and is now facing you  guys on the other side of the gate up close it is a very old 
none	 gnome those of you who have known  gnome longevity thats many years strangely adorable the eyes are tiny and beady the  eyebrows are furrowed theres a slight smile and this elderly sweetness to him as he approaches  with his arms in his robe  liam hello there grandfather  matt yes  liam we are looking for a bit of help weve been told that your knowledge is great and we have some  items that defy description  laura are you headmaster james kryon  matt no i am not i am grymond trog  liam 
none	 one more time grandfather  matt grymond trog  liam grymond trog its a pleasure to meet you  matt you as well and well met whoever you are  laura be pleased  matt you dont have to do that here  laura could we meet with headmaster james kryon weve been sent by someone very important jmon  sa ord  taliesin from across the continent  sam i flash the thing again and say in gnomish hell want to talk to us weve come a great  distance to meet him  matt and he responds in 
none	 gnomish to you very well i will go and see if the headmaster is  available i cannot promise anything but i will return you guys see this exchange in gnomish it  sounds like fast twittering  laura ive never heard you speak gnomish before scanlan  travis whatd you say  sam sighs i said someone loan me 350 gold  laura 350 gold why 350 gold  liam thats a very specific number  taliesin thats a very interesting number  matt the gnome spins around and darts back into little footfalls coasting a strange little  
dung	 zigzag back to the original doors and disappears the doors dont close they remain ajar  liam hes way faster than you  laura why dont you walk that fast scanlan  sam im carrying two giant sacks of spice it weighs me down  travis do you want to put those in the bag of holding  sam no theyre mine  travis your cross to bear got it  matt you wait about 15 minutes before the gnome grymond pops his head out once more just a  minute pops back in  liam i like that little 
none	 guy  taliesin i know hes quite pleasing  matt pops back out about ten minutes later darts over to the edge my apologies for keeping you  waiting the headmaster is unable to see visitors at the moment  laura oh no why  matt perhaps try next week  laura oh no thats such a long time we have a very short amount of time were on a crunch  marisha yes is there a standby list we can get on  matt is there something i can help you with  liam we are sort of trying 
none	 to save  marisha the world  matt thats very sweet  laura can i insight check him  marisha time is of the essence  laura 20  matt 20  sam loot crate ladies and gentlemen im wearing one of the shirts right now it came in this  months loot box loot crate i think its called actually not a loot box  liam i hear it comes with a gram of spice in every box  sam yeah that alone makes it worth about 500 every box in some circles oh boy travis is  looking 
none	  laughter  laura look were in a bit of a rush this is very important business the fate of the world  rests on your shoulders  matt persuasion check  sam persuasion check shes the best at those  laura im not terrible at it 20  sam thats good  matt his eyes blink sigh just a moment turns around and disappears back up the walkway to the  building you wait another 30 minutes  laura fucking little gnome on a power trip  liam worth it  sam what are we asking when we get 
none	 in by the way  matt you wait another ten minutes and right as your frustration is beginning to mount and youre  ready to start rattling that gate you see a figure much taller step out from the open door  to the front of the crystal chateau  liam eyes up  matt much slower and deliberate walk this taller humanoid as it approaches you see the same  white robes with the same silver grey band that goes over the shoulders the mantle pointing  out past the shoulders as it passes back into a cloak that 
none	 drifts behind the train of the robes  dragging just a few inches past the back they seem longer than should be for a normal traveling  person theyre almost ceremonial as the humanoid approaches you can see silver almost  purplecolored hair that just falls back and trails past without a stray hair in place long past the  shoulders almost like a secondary cloak and flows with each step just like the cloak does the face  is pure elven skin pale white the eyes white with a very faint gold iris no pupil seems  young though 
none	 the graying hair does lead you to believe that there is some age to this elven  individual approaches hands together in front eventually comes to the edge of the gate my  apologies for the delay apparently you have both the assistance of the soul of the jeweled city at  your disposal and youve convinced my clerk that you have important business well you have ten  minutes of my time what can i do for you  taliesin may we speak in private for that ten minutes it is sensitive  matt very well he snaps his 
none	 fingers and utters this incantation under his mouth suddenly you  have this crackling blue wall appear above you and you all are encased inside this cubelike box  its about 25 by 25 feet you hear this slight vibration crackling around you  laura is the fence still between us  matt the fence is still between us but its enclosed it closed all of you into this box  including himself and all the breeze that was blowing through has been halted you hear none of  the surrounding sounds of the city around you this appears to 
none	 be a fairly private place  laughs for at least the time hes willing to give you  taliesin do you know of the news of taldorei and emon  matt i dont really pay attention to matters that far from where we are i have important  things to tend to  taliesin foreign affairs obviously but i can see that there are aspects of this place that are  foreign that you have brought culture here and i pull out one of my guns pull it out to show him  the hiltwork which is all embedded with 
none	 actual whitestone i cannot speak the name of where we  come from but i know how this place was built and i know that perhaps we have a connection  because of it and im going to  sam shoot him in the head  laughter  taliesin dragons theres no secret to it dragons are ravaging the continent a chromatic  conclave of dragons unlike weve ever seen before have decimated the cultures of the other  end of the earth dragons we have never seen before but you have and im going to minor  illusion in 
none	 my hand an image of the red dragon with the ruby in his chest sitting atop im  creating a little visual of it  matt its rudimentary  taliesin its rudimentary but its there its obviously an illusion its not meant to look  real its fuzzy  matt its a princess leia froze coming out of r2d2 in a lost hope takes a look at it seemingly  unmoved and goes and  taliesin they will come here they will come here and they will ravage weve been given the  opportunity and the hope of stopping them 
none	 before they reach your shores  liam we have ended two of them and we want to end them all before they come anywhere near these  shores  matt that sounds like an absolutely remarkable endeavor and i wish you the best of luck  taliesin if we could just have a bit of help identifying a few objects of magical power and  hopefully finding a few more keys to stopping them it would ingratiate us to you so much that i would  be delighted to speak of a future of hopefully making sure that more of 
none	 this beautiful whitestone  that you use everywhere in this beautiful palace is available and deeply indebted  matt as you do say whitestone his eyes for the first time do lock into yours  marisha whispering tell him who you are percy  taliesin i cannot tell him who i am  matt well you now have six more minutes of my time if you are here for simple identification  purposes i can aid you in this what would you like me to see for you  taliesin they are not simple we are not starting with the 
none	 jug  liam step up grog show him the gloves  travis oh yes i got these titanstone knuckles off my uncle they make me bigger and stronger  but im not sure what else they do  matt he leans forward and places his hands through the gate openings on the sides of where the  various bars are and touches them and his eyes flare with a flash of sudden arcane energy his  hands just tense for a moment and he lets go indeed they are a vestige i have not seen one in  person congratulations 
none	 that is a very worthy find there are museums and collectors that would  pay quite a penny for such an item  travis no im not interested in selling it  marisha but you have heard of these vestiges before  matt i have come across them in my research yes  liam we have three of them  marisha have you heard of one called cabals ruin  matt ive heard of it  marisha its a cloak  matt a cloak yes yes i have come across it in my papers before but that was quite some 
none	 time ago  and thats the extent of my knowledge i fear sorry  taliesin show him your bow  laura our second vestige  matt leans forward this time with one hand and touches the edge of it as he touches the edge it  curls against the tip of his finger and he pulls back a little bit creeped out by it  laura fenthras  matt fenthras and his eyes flash again the bow seems to stop moving for a second and then  relax back into its slow organic movement this is also quite a find 
none	 a powerful weapon fey in  nature it seems to extend sight and grow that which it slays he gives you information on each  of these vestiges as part of his identify spell and there is no additional information beyond what you already know  about the item  liam i misspoke we have four scanlan show him your blade  sam french accent mythcarver  matt french accent mythcarver  sam is how some would say it  matt he takes it his eyes flash again as he glances over the blade one of the non  divinebased 
none	 vestiges here you are much like those knuckles  travis nondivine  matt some were created in the sphere of some deitys influence some were created by powerful  practitioners of the arcane remember the calamity the battle that sparked the divergence  itself was a battle against the gods against wayward arcane magics and the division between  the societal belief in both  laura did anyone in the allegiance create these items  matt no the allegiance has only been around for about 80 90 years but some of us have come  across information about these as 
none	 scattered as they are  taliesin we have the tea set as well do we have anything else  sam can you tell me anything more about the blade  matt it resonates with sound and speech and song he gives you basically the information you  have about the mythcarver  liam probably overkill but i draw back the white that im wearing what of this armor can you tell  me anything about it  matt he reaches forward and touches the armor eyes flash again he gives you a full detailed  description of the armor youre 
none	 holding he says this has been awakened interesting yes its  rare that artifacts have an awakening interesting  liam is that something that any of these would do  matt i do not know this is my first time actually handling any vestiges for the record  you carrying this many puts quite a target on your back from anyone whos interested in selling them  or making them their own i would recommend not telling anyone what you have in your possession  taliesin you are the only one that weve told  matt good keep it that 
none	 way  taliesin just a few more things  laura i pull out the tea set that has lm engraved on it that we got in  matt unfortunately youve expended most of my identification this day  taliesin less of a magical investigation then i pull out a piece of the green elemental shard from  whitestone and show it to him  matt might i have a look at that he takes it reaches into his robes pulls out a very  wellcrafted glass jewelers piece glances over it for a second he clicks a small button on 
none	 the  side of it each time he does you see the lens change color on the end of it i have not seen  anything like this not of condensed purified whitestone  taliesin yes i take it back  matt as you take it he gives a little resistance the possibilities of such a substance  is intriguing  marisha can i do an insight check on him  matt go for it  marisha 19  matt okay  laura can we ask him how he got his purple hair because i want some purple hair  
none	 travis make sure to visit the geek and sundry store for all of our new merch items  liam espionage nail wraps  travis weve got these new bitching bracelets  sam but these have critical role themes to them  laura look sam we have a critical role mug  sam no way thats really available i want one how much are they 50 100 just 20  taliesin think of all the spice you could get  matt should you have any more that you do not require i am sure i could convince the allegiance  to 
none	 pay quite a hefty sum  taliesin money doesnt interest us at this point we are under siege but cooperation and help in  our endeavor certainly does the process is known to my people and a closely guarded secret  obviously we would be happy to restore normal relations once we are no longer in danger excited  for normal relations and proper trade we are a city in need  matt if i may have your name then sir  taliesin i do not give him my name but i put together a quick piece of paper with 
none	 the royal seal  matt okay he takes it  taliesin its enough that you need not have any paper proof of who i am other than the fact that  if this place was built then that should be very useful to you if this place was built the way we  expect if we survive and especially with your cooperation and help we will be back to this  city and we will be grateful  marisha we can always come back with more of this condensed whitestone in tow  taliesin its very expensive and very rare 
none	 sadly  matt i look forward to your return once this wyrm intrusion is completed and we can discuss  business  taliesin worm intrusion oh the wyrm i thought you were talking about the hole out front is that  anything we can help with were quite adept  matt no were good but thank you  liam i hate to wear out our welcome but you said you were spent is it possible your friend who  scuttled off could have a look at my sisters tea set  laura oh really they are so smart and magical 
none	  matt you are asking us to spend this last minute of time that ive promised to you to retrieve my  clerk to see what your tea set does  liam i was asking that yes  matt very well  travis well i have a question would you ever engage in matters outside of this stupidass place  matt referring to what  travis you know other countries people in danger dragons you seem to be a powerful  magician of some sort would you ever help  matt i do not nor does the allegiance get involved 
none	 in political matters we are simply a  collection of scholars and we attempt to keep it that  laura in your scholarly knowledge do you know how to kill a red dragon  taliesin with no heart  matt i would say that is probably a bit beyond my capability but if indeed that little bauble  that your tiny friend carries is to believe true i think youve already found favors and allies far  beyond anything we could provide  taliesin we need everything we can get and we are down several libraries on our continent they 
none	  do enjoy watching the knowledge of the ages burn  matt well perhaps you should get on seeing them felled fairly soon then  marisha hopefully take this as the fair warning that it was meant to be  matt the city has seen quite a few aggressors and not one has made it farther than the outside walls  marisha so i have heard  laura but this isnt one this is several  taliesin and that is why they have given us their favors because they understand that this threat  is greater  matt and yet 
none	 you have already felled a few yourselves i am certain you will be  successful in the rest of your endeavor  marisha one last note you mentioned cabals ruin have you heard of the den of druja  matt druja yes that was naught but 60 years ago there was a bit of an incursion an uprising  of a guild that was getting a bit big for its britches and was muscling its way through most of  the suncut bazaar some sort of a conflict arose and the streets were lined with bodies at certain  moments 
none	 however it seems that they were dealt with rather quickly succinctly one of our  wayward mages that had apparently been helping helm this endeavor was brought to justice with a  blade to his throat  marisha really what was the name of this sorcerer magician mage  matt i mean no disrespect to you but it is a place of particular sourness and shame within the  allegiance and we wish to move on from it  marisha sure but isnt knowledge like this best known so that history does not repeat itself  matt we know it 
none	 well and it will not be repeated i do not know you yet you ask us  questions deep within our history that we do not wish to discuss for our own reasons  travis lot of answers we got here lot of answers  sam maybe we just asked the wrong questions  travis maybe i should just ask him to identify this  taliesin i think youve already burned the charge on that one for the day  matt as you put your finger up he puts up three fingers and that is your ten minutes thank you 
none	  so much for your time please do make sure the allegiance knows once youve completed your  journey up in wherever these dragons are and return i think there are many things we could  discuss to the benefit of both you and us now i have things to attend to i wish you good day  taliesin good day to you sir  laura you ruined your business deal have fun  travis he counted ten like this i thought they were learned  matt and with that he exits back and the door closes shut  laura

town	  followed that silent messenger that treev had sent off when you first made your request of the  mistress heading through alleyways diving over from upper to lower levels through long hallways  beneath buildings to small side roads until eventually you find your way into this small area  thats nestled in between two large warehouses there appears to be some crates theres some  barrels around this small building that reads on the sign above the door a kingly home the door  is closed there appears to be a window right next to the door there 
none	 is the series of barrels and  theres the one barrel you saw where the individual moved it and placed the actual request  that you guys made through a small slot in the wall  laura are there any other people around  matt you can see actually everyone roll a stealth check whos coming through yeah you  guys are behind so the three of you guys  sam 14  liam 25  travis 14  matt not you grog youre not going  laura 16  matt okay you guys make your way through the hallway

none	 nice  home for an individual that does shady work  liam and nobodys hiding  matt you can make a perception check  liam 27  sam nothing  laura 32  matt you guys take the next few minutes quietly off in the shadows looking about the upper and  lower regions of this small alcove where the house is about four or five minutes into that youre  pretty certain that nobody here is hidden and you are alone other than the home at least for the  time being  sam should i just go knock 
none	 on the front door  liam that was my suggestion but i thought we came here to watch for a bit i say to scanlan  sitting on my shoulders  laura should we go peek in the window maybe maybe you since youre sneaky oh yeah or that  scanlan you can turn into a bug or something  sam whatever you want  laura ooh i can use wait does this have to be  liam i think bug  sam bug you want bug  laura this doesnt have to be attuned i have from a long

none	 floor but theres no light from the  inside  sam okay just going to go all the way around the house high and low looking for a way in do i  find it  matt make an investigation check  sam a lot 24  matt 24 after coming around you begin to slink around by the barrels and you can see in the  stonework that has been built the masonry that forms the exterior of the building there appears  to be a very small hole about corksize hidden behind one of the barrels in the 
dung	 front theres  just enough space between the wall where you can barely squeeze in and poke through its big  enough where your wings will hit so you have to attach to it and crawl through before coming out  the other side as you come out the other side youre now inside the house dark interior make a  perception check  sam one  matt youre inside the building but it is very dark all you see is the one little beam of light  coming through the window that is facing where the sun currently is 
none	 in the sky and is creating the  one beam on the ground and the little bit of wood thats there thats as much as you can make out  at the moment  sam i will fly around and see if i knock into anything  matt you knock into a shelf unit buzzing you knock into another shelf unit buzzing you stop  on the top of a chair thats off in a far corner go over it you glance over and a little bit of  light is bouncing off the sunbeam you can see beneath the

none	 lock you spend about five minutes with it youre  not getting any of the tumblers  laura just go inside unlock it from the inside but dont tell my brother i couldnt unlock this  okay  sam wait first im going to try to pick the lock  laura do you have thieves tools then go fuck yourself you cant  matt just roll a d20 and add your dexterity modifier  sam four all right ill just go in there  matt he pulls out a couple of barely unfurled pieces of wire puts them in there 
none	 for a second  and they both break inside of it  sam all right i will dimension door inside  matt okay youre now inside as you go back to the door you can see there is a heavy latch  and some sort of a padlock on it  sam goddamn it on the inside  liam have i gotten back to the rest  matt you have gotten back pretty quick full speed you guys over the next two minutes or so  the rest of the party gets there you can go ahead and make another 
none	 shot the dc is going to  increase though  laura i try it again natural 20  matt very difficult because it is not only a difficult lock with the interior padlock but  scanlan broke off pieces of wire in it that are in danger of permanently breaking the lock and making  it unusable you however thankfully manage to maneuver the tools to remove the pieces of wayward  wire finish the lock and as soon as you finish unlocking the padlock on the inside with a curved  piece the door opens and theres a slight 
none	 flash nothing  laura oh no its an alarm we need to get the fuck out of here  matt no noise make a perception check  marisha did we forget to check for traps again  laura no i did i checked 16  matt 16 ah as scanlan from the inside and you on the outside you take a quick glance inside  just scanning around you can see bed on the far side the trapdoor thats open the stairs that  lead down what catches your eye is right around the outside of the entrance to the 
dung	 basement you  see these dark spots across the ground that generally fade as they reach the door that youre  at these are familiar spots these are tiny little spatters of viscera blood dried  laura gasps leading from the door to the trapdoor  matt leading from the trapdoor to the door dissipating as it comes to your door  marisha wait and its dried  matt it looks like its been there for a while yeah  laura oh shit so the trap couldve done something to somebody before  sam no more blood toward the trapdoor 
none	 and then it fades so someone came out of the trapdoor  marisha and tried to haul ass out  travis what was the flash  sam an alarm  laura do i see footprints around  matt as you get close and look down you can see in a couple of the dried blood smears there  appear to be footprints in them that are heading out  sam i go over to the trapdoor and inspect it for traps  matt make an investigation check  sam it being a trapdoor it should have a trap 17  
none	 matt the trapdoor is still open its left open and the stairs that descend there is no trap in  the vicinity looks like its been untouched for a while you guys are just now starting to approach  the outside of the house as you get there you see the door is partially ajar and it is open  and you can vaguely see movement on the inside of vex and scanlan looking about  liam nice job ace whats going on  laura there was a trap i think there was a trap on it and i didnt 
town	 know but i looked for traps  there was a flash does that sound familiar  travis is anyone new on the streets or on the roofs above us  matt perception check  marisha can i look down the road because im down a bit see if anyone looks like theyre  coming this way  travis 16  taliesin 26  marisha 18  matt okay the three of you looking about there are some people in the distance that pass by three  alleys down but theres nobody paying attention to or immediately in the vicinity of 
none	 this little  alcove nothing unusual  liam scanlans by the open trapdoor inside  taliesin im going to nonchalantly walk in open the door and just well all come in and shut the  door behind us  laura is there any blood on the inside of the door  matt if you look on the inside of the door there is actually a hand print in blood against the top  of it  laura does it look like it was trying to open the door does it look like it got the door open or  it 
none	 was stuck inside  matt no it looks like as it wraps around the top it looks like somebody had lifted it up  laura oh the trapdoor  taliesin is there blood on the handle is there blood on the door itself  matt looking at the inside handle there are very faint traces of dried blood  marisha can i do a check on the outside threshold of the door to see if i can see the blood go  outward  matt sure make an investigation check  laura i go and grab our note that we 
none	 sent and take it  matt okay you put it away  marisha nothing no  taliesin i will check for that too  matt you guys are out in the open right now slowly inspecting the ground in the middle of this  alley  taliesin 11 im at the door looking out  liam im going down the trapdoor carefully  marisha okay were all inside right  matt yeah youre all inside vax is vanishing down the trapdoor  taliesin im doing a quick gentle sweep of the room looking for any invisible bodies in the  
none	 corner just moving my hand around  matt okay as you guys are scanning this vax you head down into the bottom beneath this small  hovel in this trapdoor the stairs stop and to the left of you there is another door that is  partially left open into another chamber that is beneath  liam i want to look for traps on the door  matt the door is open but yeah  liam okay but there could still be okay investigation right 19  matt does not appear to be trapped  liam so im still stealthed 
none	 im going to gently open the door and peer in  matt you pull it open look inside this is a larger chamber with a much better set of  furniture it looks like the woman that you had hired probably lived here more than above you see  what would be weapons racks but have been cleaned out you see a couple of lanterns that are placed  upon a table in the corner that have since burned out one of them has actually fallen over and it  appears the glass is broken on the ground make a 
none	 perception check  liam 25  matt glancing across the room you can see more of the thicker blood spatters with other  footprints in them multiple footprints you see a body still on the other side of the room  laura oh somebody else got the vestige  matt you come up to the body and it appears to be a female form you see black hair with white  streaks throughout ornate scale mail armor of black and purple as you pull her over the face  appears to be in her mid to late forties her left 
none	 eye is ruined and sealed closed with a scar there  is a very large pool of drying coagulated blood sitting beneath her giving a moment to inspect  her she is indeed dead and has been for the better part of a week her wounds involve several  severe puncture wounds throughout her torso multiple stabs one in her throat  sam can anyone talk to her  marisha pikes not here  matt are the rest of you guys coming down to see this  taliesin im heading down if everybody else is  laura i look around

none	 at the house  taliesin trying to get a sense of the situation of the murder how many people there were  investigation 13  matt theres a lot of foot movements some more heavy than others it looks like there was a  scuffle here but its hard to tell how many people were involved definitely more than two  whatd you roll 21 15 youre having a hard time finding anything that really specifically  represents that scuffle  laura i bring trinket out and have him sniff around  matt okay trinket begins sniffing around the room 
dung	 keyleth you find a series of puncture marks  in the walls themselves in some of the dirt and stone parts of the wall some small stab puncture  wounds across the wall in different places  taliesin just to be safe im going to close the trap door  marisha is it dark down here  matt it is pitch dark percy for the most part you dont have any sort of sight  marisha is it safe for me to throw out a daylight spell i throw up a daylight  matt the room now illuminates and you 
none	 all have a very clear perspective on this you inspecting  the body the puncture wounds that are in the front have corresponding puncture wounds in the  back as well you can see clasps on the shoulders where a cloak would be affixed but the clasps  have been broken off and there is no cloak there  travis any treasures in the room  matt whatd you roll for an investigation check  travis 18  matt 18 most of the room has been completely ransacked it looks like there were places where  some things might have 
none	 been useful but they have been taken you find a couple of discarded jewel  boxes or lockboxes that have since been broken open and left with a couple scattered gold coins  here and there but this place has been completely cleaned out  sam i was looking for other exits and entrances to the building all around and i rolled a 29  matt there looks to be one hidden passage behind this one cabinet where all the drawers have been  pulled out and left on the ground empty but behind that there is a small tunnel 
town	 that exits  outward  sam to the street  matt you dont know as youre inspecting it youre seeing more and more of these each one of  these puncture marks that hit the front also correspond to the back its a clear wound through  each way and it appears to be a burn around the outside of each one of these punctures  taliesin well i havent looked at them yet and theres no reason to look until someone yeah  liam percival come here  laura can i have trinket sniff around for anything that doesnt 
none	 smell like her for other  people  liam perce this looks like your work  laura advantage on smell  taliesin i take a look at the body  matt you are very familiar with these type of wounds corresponding to the punctures youve seen  in the wall behind you go back check and begin to pry in and you pull out small iron balls  marisha i pull it out and i hand it to percy  taliesin well that was quick  marisha im sorry i guess our girl is back in our narrative  taliesin 
none	 thats the best case scenario  marisha so hang on which hand is ripley missing right hand what hand print is on the trapdoor is  it a left hand  matt its a left hand  travis how did she even know about this  marisha shes been doing a lot of research and shes been following our exploits  taliesin shes probably spying on me  marisha we know shes a huge fan of percy  taliesin waiting for me to build something  sam single whitestone female  laura maybe mistress asharru wasnt wearing the cloak maybe 
none	 she happened to hide it down the  tunnel  sam i found a secret exit that someone could have used to come in and kill or exit after or maybe  not at all  taliesin are there exit wounds on the back of the body as well  matt there are yes corresponding exit wounds  liam ill walk over to scanlan im going in  matt okay you guys follow this tunnel its a very small tunnel and it continues on for a very  intense period of time  liam trap check that is a 24 
none	  matt okay keeping your eyes up as you continue along you do not find any traps eventually it  comes up and stops there above you can see theres a small series of hand platforms or  grooves in the wall that lead up to this cylinder and above you can see a grate  liam start climbing up it  matt you climb up and push off there you come out just glancing up very carefully over the  side you see an opening into the suncut bazaar just outside of an alleyway that opens up into the 
none	  rest of the chaos  taliesin we need to get the word out and quickly we need to find her before she figures out a way  to return  marisha get the word out about what  taliesin shes still in this city  laura it was over a week ago potentially she could be long gone  marisha the leader of one of the largest criminal masterminds is now dead in the city we have to  find the murderer what do we say  sam how long has the body been here a week ill talk
