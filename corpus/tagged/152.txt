your robes  matt so welcome back last we left off the mighty nein were making their way north after  making a deal with the gentleman in zadash they had completed the first of two tasks for him the  second one requiring them to make their way to the northern city of shadycreek run outside of the  empire to meet with a business operative of his who had been busy with some other elements and /none/  needed some help to reconnect about what their business together was along this journey you had  made a stop in the gnomish city of hupperdook where you discovered the workhardplayhard  gnomish society got all your money taken from you got it returned to you as you found out the  thieves were the young children of a family the parents of which had been arrested and had been  imprisoned for a while you went to the prison helped destroy one of their longhaywire  guardians and paid off the rest of the fine for those parents /town/ to set them free returning them to  their children and decided to leave your temporary companion for a while kiri with them  as a safer means of continuing her journey now with her new family  with that you gathered your things found yourself a better crossbow and began heading back  on the trail along the crispvale road and making your way northward there you had set up camp for  the evening about a days travel outside of hupperdook and during the night while yasha and  fjord were taking their watch wakening jester with their /none/ conversation and the three of them  deciding to step away from the camp as not to wake the rest of you they were well they went missing  sam we dont know  matt we begin todays story as morning slowly creeps over the distant mountains the cold  frosted dew on the tops of the nearby grasses glistening like tiny crystals the bits of  sunlight begin to just break past the ridge the sky previously clear the night before showing the  stars above now is matted with cloud cover and small breaks that show the blue /none/ sky above the  cold weather is definitely shaking you awake as you all begin to come to rubbing your eyes  glancing about the cold atmosphere you come to the hard dirt ground patch that you had cleared  out for your evenings rest your packs and tents ready to be reassembled but its just the four  of you  sam jester i need some pocket bacon for breakfast jester jester oh shes probably  taking a dump in the woods  marisha i think i have some pocket bacon still  sam oh can i have some /none/  marisha yeah its a little moldy  sam oh thats even better eating noises  marisha okay  taliesin fjord never came back after watch last night  liam i stand up and scan the area  matt make a perception check  liam what is that thats a six plus something nine  matt looking about there is a faint mist that is still burning off that clouds your vision far  enough to the point where you cant quite see some elements of the mountain range you had just come  from but glancing about around you /none/ theres no sign of your three companions theres no visuals  that guide you to where they might be  marisha wheres yasha shes gone too  sam she does that sometimes im sure its nothing  marisha yeah but  taliesin fjord  marisha and taliesin jester  taliesin the travelers bullshit  sam thats playing  taliesin that really wouldve worked  sam thats playing with fire  taliesin im going to check the tents im going to check the tents to see if their stuff is still there  matt as you go about to their sleeping /none/ arrangement spaces everything except for whatever  they had on them as they took their watch is still there the haversack is left behind the rest of  their goods lying on the ground where they were left  sam their personal belongings and stuff  matt yep  marisha falchion  matt the falchions always with him  marisha right but his holster thingy right didnt he have a holster thing or did i just  imagine that because hes texblade  matt he would have a belt with pouches and such but no that was on him at /none/ the time  sam his spats and spurs  matt those are not there unfortunately  sam oh wow  matt essentially everything but the equipment they had on them in fact if you look you can  see jesters shield is there currently untouched  marisha its not right  taliesin yashas stuff is still here  matt yasha doesnt have much on her whatever she does have she generally keeps on her so she  hasnt left anything behind  taliesin so theres nothing behind  liam are their weapons here  matt you dont see any weapons /none/ yasha keeps her weapon on her at all times fjord from what you  understand weirdly never seems to have need but jesters weapon is left next to the shield as well  as you begin to rummage through  sam ill take a swig to calm my morning nerves and start searching around to see if theres any  notes or any signs of anything around  matt make an investigation check  sam okay thats terrible  taliesin thats unbelievably bad  sam thats an eight  matt all right then as you begin to rummage around in /town/ the nearby grasses tossing over the  remains of their left behind materials even pushing through the fire just in case some of them  may have fallen in no sign  taliesin im going to check the road for fresh tracks see if anything looks like it was disturbed  matt youd make an investigation check then  marisha are there trees nearby  matt not within the next mile or so  taliesin oh for fucks sake same roll two  matt okay  liam i am going to sit down and bring frumpkin out and pull out /none/ my book and begin to do whats  needed to cast it again find familiar but im going to turn frumpkin into uh a peregrine falcon  matt okay  sam whoa  marisha that was very specific for an uh to come before it  matt laughs so as you are both losing yourselves amongst the nearby grasses and trying  to look for any sign of where they may have been you are focusing on your spell what are you  doing beauregard  marisha can i see if i see any grass thats been laid down like /none/ a direction that there might be  people who have walked through  matt go ahead and make an investigation check  marisha thats a natural one  sam oh my god were not even going to know theyre gone  laughter  taliesin theyre literally scarecrows in the background  liam theyre probably skinny dipping somewhere  matt this is amazing  sam we got a two a two a one what was your first roll  liam i rolled a six which turned into a nine  sam okay so six is our top roll so far  /none/ matt knocking it out of the park yall  taliesin we are children lost at a ross dress for less were never going to see our parents again  its all over  marisha first roll in the new studio its a one  matt well get them out now in the time that you guys have begun to shout youre continuing to  shout their names out and forge through the nearby grasses caleb you complete your spell  and frumpkins form suddenly slowly shifts then with a puff of steam and smoke turns into the  falcon lands /none/ on your shoulder caws  liam i know i am sorry i will change you back as fast as i can i need you to look for the three  that you do not see here the green one the blue one and the goth one go  matt you watch as frumpkin takes off into the sky and does a few loops go ahead and make a  perception check from a birds eye view which makes it a little easier  taliesin cawing  liam natural 20  taliesin hey thank god  matt there you go when /none/ humanity fails bring in the hawks  marisha we know nature is better at everything  matt with a quick singular pass overhead you watch as frumpkin sends you an immediate bit of  information you focus through the eyes and glancing down you see a clearing where a large  portion of grass maybe about 60 or so feet from where you guys are has been pushed down and you  see tracks and drag marks and grooves in the dirt  liam oh shit there was a this way i come out of it so i dont trip /none/ on rocks theres a struggle  this way and i lead the group back to this  matt all right you guys rush over and there you can see on the ground this patch of disturbed  grass that has been pushed down along with the dirt that has been jammed and shoved up into small  side piles and trenches that were dug in theres definitely signs of a struggle here at a quick  glance looking around footprints and signs there looks to be somewhere between five to eight  sets of footprints you can see from all /town/ different angles and you can see three grooves being  dragged through the dirt into the grass towards the road a little bit northward  sam can we follow those grooves  matt yeah you guys go ahead and follow these the best you can eventually making your way to the  outer side of the crispvale road the path that you were on already but a little ways north of  where you were and there you can see the grooves end and a number of sets of heavy wagon wheels  begin or at least have previously pulled /town/ off the trail and then pushed themselves back onto the road  marisha so its impossible to tell if its the same one  sam can we see which direction those wagon tracks went in  matt its hard to tell which direction wagon tracks go in necessarily make a survival check  sam survival nine  matt laughs could be going north could be going south youre not entirely sure  sam that narrows it down its not east or west guys  matt northeast or southwest  sam god damn it  marisha well thats more narrow when /town/ it was going on the road was it going towards the  direction we were going or were we following it  matt youre not entirely certain the tracks seem to be traveling either in the northeast direction  that the road goes that you were traveling or heading back towards hupperdook what you do  notice though and what keys you in that this has something to do with this is the tracks grind off  the road by about five or ten feet and thats where the grooves of these dragged individuals or  sacks stop and then /town/ it pushes back onto the road  liam here is what i am wondering why we are still here yasha and jester and fjord they  didnt know each other before a month ago  sam who was on watch it was fjord and yasha right  marisha yeah  sam so they would have been awake but what about jester she was asleep right  marisha she also has a big old crushie on fjord  liam if they were taken that means they came to our camp and took her possibly and even if they  did not /town/ its not like we were hiding  marisha why couldnt we hear anything  sam maybe they werent targeting anyone specific just coming to grab folks and those were the ones  that were awake or closest to the road or  liam youd take the three beefiest of a group of strangers  sam well they took the three ugliest ones i mean they left us  taliesin first thank you second they may have just taken the ones that were furthest away from  the light they just picked them off maybe you walk away from camp thats /dung/ what happens i mean  its not the biggest or strongest its the  sam wait im going to examine the tracks for blood  matt make another investigation check  sam mmm thats an 11  matt its better in looking through near where these cart tracks begin theres no signs of  blood going back and following the grooves through the dirt you find a few small traces  sam anything weird about the blood is it green blood purple blood blue blood  matt no just standard dark dustedover blood at this point  marisha censored video /town/ game blood  sam that means that they werent bleeding when they were dragged which means that either they  were killed by vampires and all their blood was sucked out of them first or they were still alive  marisha and that blood was far away from our camp maybe they were just triggered by a sound  that they heard and they went to go investigate it  taliesin im going to freak out is there any trash or anything on the road im just going to  look for any  matt make a perception check  /town/ taliesin thats better 14  matt 14 as you look off looking for any sign of change theres the fog at the far peripheral of  where youre watching nothing on the road except for a couple of tufts of scrub brush catch your  eyes until you see a dark shape on the road to the south  taliesin moving  matt moving it looks to be a shadowed outline of a person  taliesin im going to draw both swords and head towards it  sam seeing that i will draw my new crossbow turn it on i /none/ imagine its batterypowered  poweringup noise  laughter  marisha four d batteries its very obnoxious  matt they run out in half an hour its like a game gear  liam do you want my notcat to go look first  taliesin i may have already moved i didnt think of that  matt i think mollys already off  marisha im following molly as i follow molly i turn to nott and caleb and i say just stay back  for a second back us up if we need it  sam sure  matt so youve nocked /none/ your bolt into your crossbow for the first time as it winds back you  crank it and it slips into place you hear this faint spring tension  sam ooh  matt as youre preparing for this molly and beau start rushing up  taliesin yeah im just going to be obvious  marisha i flank  matt okay so you head off into the brush  marisha stealth  matt make a stealth check  liam i send frumpkin to do a lazy circle  marisha man this feels like last game 12  matt 12 okay good /none/ to know molly as you get closer the shape takes more form as the mist  fades and your proximity grows closer you see a squat figure wide and muscular armored with a  sack over the shoulder ashly if you want to enter  sam what whoa  taliesin that was fast  liam this is your life  matt ashly burch joins us at the table  liam hey ashly welcome  matt so ashly if youd like to describe what molly sees as he approaches  ashly what molly sees is a dwarven woman with a five /none/ oclock shadow a cigarette hanging out of  her mouth extremely battered bloodied rusted armor full armor and short greasy hair and she  has a big ol axe in one hand and a big ol hammer in the other does she see these folk now  matt roll a perception check for me  ashly i dont have dice  matt oh we should get that for you  sam how this is terrible here  liam the laura bailey bladder was right here whered it go  marisha yeah do you want pick a dice bag  matt /none/ we got plenty  taliesin and here have a thing  ashly oh hey thanks guys its like im part of the crew okay so im rolling perception  matt yes so roll a d20 add your perception modifier  ashly okay  sam so much better than us  ashly its 18  matt so you see one figure coming towards you difficult to make out gender of lavender skin  curled horns filled with jewelry big long coat of multicolors maroon but then it goes into a  rainbow pattern almost with two glowing scimitars to each side /none/ staring you down behind that you  see two figures a little bit beyond your sight to make out all the details but one seems to be a  tall humanoid the other seems to be much shorter and smaller probably halfling gnome and then  off in the bushes not hiding very well you see another figure keeping low to your left  ashly ah son of a dick all right lets get this over with and then she holds up her  battleaxe and her warhammer  sam oh shes challenging us  marisha as i make eyecontact /none/ im like aw shit was it the blue was i too tall  ashly i mean you guys have your weapons drawn im assuming are we going to do this or what  marisha i would just like a little bit of feedback so i know how to perfect it later  ashly are you asking about your hiding  marisha yeah  ashly its shit man you gotta choose a new  marisha fuck all right  ashly i saw you i thought you werent trying to hide  marisha youve got great eyesight  ashly not

come from what are you doing in the  bloody bushes by our campsite  ashly i was walking up the road man i didnt expect to see a bunch of poorly hidden weirdos  with fucking weapons drawn  liam shouts just make conversation  marisha hows your day  laughter  ashly weird now  marisha sorry happens sometimes  ashly wait where are you guys from are you from the run  marisha whats the run no /town/ really whats the run that sounds fascinating  ashly so youre not from the run  sam shouts i think she means shadycreek run  ashly yeah that  marisha oh shit we should have thought about that i dont

just one theres still one glowing sword  ashly here ill put away the hammer  laughter  matt /none/ the deescalation has begun  taliesin we more or less got robbed last night and youre the first living human being that weve  seen or not human being  ashly dwarf  marisha and by robbed he means half of our party got abducted robbed thats such a light  way of putting it  ashly whoa your party got abducted when  marisha and taliesin last night  ashly son of a bitch yeah okay  marisha we were actually headed to the run it does sound pretty cool  ashly all right  sam im going to /none/ walk up next to molly  marisha shouts yeah hey caleb nott  matt this tiny figure hooded with wrappings and a creepy porcelain doll face that covers  ashly all right i pull my hammer back out  sam should i

value  sam you can come up now caleb  liam shouts no im /none/ good  taliesin were having a very bad morning i apologize if we came off a little terse all  right fine  marisha were a little on edge

im scooping up the haversack  ashly so heres the deal shadycreek run is full of a bunch of shitty lowlifes theyre /none/ all  murderers theyre all pieces of shit the people that took your friends are the biggest pieces of  shit in the entire place  marisha thats nice  sam who are they  ashly theyre called the iron shepherds slavers murderers basic pieces of shit theyre very good  at what they do they are the scariest most powerful people that ive probably ever met and  ive met a lot of people i grew up in shadycreek run  liam when you say powerful are you talking about ability or connections or both  ashly both  /town/ liam shit  ashly everybody knows them there  marisha you said slavers  ashly yeah sorry to break it you but your pals just got taken into slavery  sam why are they operating this far from the run also what kind of slavers these are  powerful people that they just kidnapped  ashly yeah thats what they want  liam this is why maybe they took the beefy ones  ashly theyre not trying to find weaklings on the side of the road which is why it seems like most  of you people got spared  /none/ sam okay okay you dont know us  ashly hey you bared your teeth at me five times little man  sam i gave you a little bourbon im a lady i gave you some booze the least you could do is  afford us the benefit of the doubt  ashly sorry  taliesin she does have a fair point though we are a little squishy  ashly im not really good at the people thing  taliesin youre in good company right now  sam beau is terrible with relationships and social interactions  marisha thats why we /none/ clearly got off to a great start sorry  liam im not very good at it either and you are an exile  marisha im also trying to work on the manners thing  ashly cool all right  marisha the guy who actually got taken from us was helping me  taliesin we lost the charm  sam do you know any of their names the shepherds  ashly yeah i know all of them  sam who are they  ashly okay before that heres the deal i have some beef as you may have gathered with this /none/  crew im not interested in just getting your friends and getting out i want to fucking kill  every single last one of them if you want any more information from me im going to need a  little bit of buyin  taliesin i just toss 20 gold and im like throw me a cigarette please  sam 20 gold is expensive wait so if you could rescue your friends or friend or whatever  ashly there aint nobody left to rescue man  sam are you sure  ashly yeah pretty fucking sure  sam so its /none/ revenge then  ashly yeah  marisha if shadycreek run is full of a bunch of criminals and you said you lived there for a  while what were you doing there  ashly its not important  marisha well thats pretty clear  ashly no one there did anything nice okay so fucking imagine something shitty and i probably  did it okay im not proud of it im trying to turn a new leaf as it were  sam i just imagined some crazy shit  laughter  marisha its like a horror film the more you leave /none/ it up to your imagination the worse it is  taliesin im not one to interrogate someones past informations information we could use some help  ashly if you want my aid i know that place like the back of my hand i need some kind of assurance  that when we find these motherfuckers youre not just going to grab your friends and run because  im going to need some backup if im going to take them out  marisha how about equal assurance that you dont fuck us over  taliesin you could also hire us  /none/ ashly hire you  taliesin 20 gold  ashly you just gave me 20 gold  taliesin yes thats how i know you can afford us  laughter  ashly 20 gold all told  taliesin and we split whatever we find  marisha and you dont fuck us and we dont fuck you unless like you know  taliesin you pay at the end of the deal  ashly all right deal  marisha its been a while  sam youre confident that you can lead us to these shepherds  ashly ive been tracking them for a while /none/  liam you know we are some of us a selfdeprecating lot we have some skill between  the four of us but it would help a lot to know what kind of people not just assholes we are  assholes what kind of assholes we are talking about  ashly sorcerers barbarians theres a little shit thats a rogue  sam how many of them are there  ashly theres five  sam hey were five  ashly yeah kind of were probably a good three and a half if were being honest  sam dont put yourself down /none/ like that im sure you can hold your own  ashly im talking about you mostly sweet cheeks theres five  liam are they part of a larger organization or are they off themselves its just them  ashly they work for someone a family in shady creek run theyre powerful  marisha theyre mobsters  weird question have i heard about this group considering my background  matt make a history check  marisha history my history changed here recently thats my second natural one in a row  im going to get rid of this one wheres laura /town/ with her dice jail when you need it thats an 18  that i just rolled now  matt you have not heard of the iron shepherds before you have some base knowledge of some  families that might do business in the outside but the information youve been given so far the  iron shepherds dont ring a bell  marisha okay  sam you know when we were in zadash we heard the town crier talking about kidnappings in  nogvurot thats close to shadycreek run could that be the same people do you think  ashly i /none/ mean possibly theres a lot of folks doing the same kind of work these folk happen to  be the best at it  marisha do you know all of the members of this iron brigade whats it called  ashly close enough  marisha iron shepherds  sam iron chef  marisha iron shep  ashly thats my favorite travelling cuisine entertainment  liam i prefer iron fem shepard  marisha for sure  laughter  ashly this is my favorite dd game on the citadel  matt there it was i was waiting for it if someone else /none/ wasnt going to get there i was  going to do it so thank you for taking it  marisha one of them wouldnt happen to be named ophelia mardun were they no okay thats the  woman we have to find for the gentleman thats part of the reason were going  taliesin i try not to learn their names i dont want to get attached  ashly no  matt there is an aspect of that name that does ring a bell the last name  ashly oh shit say that again  marisha mardun  sam here /none/ let me pour you some more booze  ashly thank you  sam does that help  ashly yes i suddenly remember that name i know the family theyve got connections there in  fact the folks that the iron shepherds work for happen to hate that family  sam this is all connected  marisha rival mob gangs  sam its like a conspiracy and were in the middle of it  ashly you being a detective you hear other people say information and then you remark upon  it and then thats you saying youre a great detective /none/  taliesin yes  sam in large part the subject was confused as to what a detective is im not writing i dont have  a quill its something that me and one of our lost friends talked about a lot sorry  ashly sorry again im not great with people  liam do we have an arrangement here a deal  sam well kill these folks or try to anyway  ashly i dont like that last part  sam what if one gets away were going to hunt them down over our lifetime i dont know what if /none/  they go far away are we indebted to you forever now or can we put a 30 day cap on this  liam these three are of great value to us and they are our friends and we are better off with  them and it is worth the trouble we cannot accomplish what weve come out here to do in the  first place without them what  sam nothing you sure sound like our new leader  marisha wait what about me  taliesin dont panic about it its going to be fine  sam oh yeah /none/ no  marisha aw cool real cool nott  sam i mean hes got the intelligence  liam you be the leader but do we have a deal  ashly yeah we have a deal  taliesin im all in for this  ashly all right well lets get going then  sam are you just walking do you have any means of transportation  ashly do i look like i have no  taliesin we have spare horses now  sam we do  matt at which point you look over past the camp where they are and theres /none/ a cart and there are a  number of horses that are currently hitched to it at the moment for a brief moment youre like  oh the thought of not having to travel on foot sounds fantastic  ashly lets do that lets please god do that  taliesin were half packed already  matt as you guys pack up your goods get the rest of your material packed up couple things to keep  in mind looking at the map if you want to pull it out and get an idea of the direction youre traveling  sam /none/ oh we have a map of some sort should we lay it out on the table and see if  matt as long you guys can see it is more the job here you can travel with your horses  sam weights  marisha sam take one side  matt with your horse and cart  marisha sponsored by wyrmwood  matt look at that timing  taliesin thats how its done  sam thank you  taliesin there you go  matt you guys are currently right here so you just left hupperdook youre on the crispvale  roadway /none/ making your way to the crispvale thicket which is the large forest at the crossroads you  can travel about 24 miles per an eight hour day at a normal pace with the horses and cart you can go  30 miles at a fast pace and you can force a march to go for another hour or two or three afterward  but you start making constitution saving throws or take exhaustion points at that point but you can  get quite a good distance depending on how fast youre going the cart keeps you at a slower pace /none/  if you were to leave the cart behind as an option you could go faster  sam but wed have to ditch some gear or do we have enough horses to carry everything including shields  taliesin we would have to ditch some  liam yeah i think we ditch the cart theyve got hours on us we need to make time  marisha i agree  taliesin how much can we carry  sam can we carry all of our friends stuff on a horse we have six horses i think  matt you have six horses between /none/ five of you as long as one of you takes the horse head you can  have a pack horse essentially its going to be hard to direct it unless someone keeps it hitched  on the side having an additional horse right now how are you going to get that to come with you at  a fast pace without a rider  liam and we cant carry their stuff without  matt you can probably carry a few things you still have horses to help carry things most of  your gear you can still put on yourself /none/ are there any large things youre not carrying a manticore  head anymore  liam we leave the shield its not a magical shield its not special  sam its not  marisha jesters  liam its run of the mill  marisha well hang on  sam its not special to her in any way  marisha i open the haversack  liam life is more special  marisha and start trying to shove as much as i can in the haversack  liam ow what are you doing  marisha im trying to just wait dont move  /town/ matt the main pack id say you can im going to say the shields not going to fully fit in it  unfortunately its a fairly wide shield and wont quite fit  marisha what about a tent can i shove a tent in here  matt a tent you can probably mangle and push in there and you manage to get the tent in but the  shield someone will have to wear on their back or strap to a horse  marisha yeah lets strap it to a horse  taliesin are we going to try and pack /town/ horse this is that how were  marisha no i think we can  liam go faster without a spare horse  marisha i think the shield and  sam the big things were leaving  marisha we put a tent in there and if we want to attach another tent to the back  liam dm you said we could put the shield on the side of a horse  matt you can put the shield strap it to a horse its fine because its just an additional  thing youre strapping on to it its up to you /town/  liam okay  matt its just the additional horse is going to be a problem if youre going to travel at a fast pace  liam well then we shouldnt do that we should go as fast as we can right now  sam all right  marisha so were leaving behind a horse and a cart  taliesin or we take the horse and cart at reasonable speed  sam no we should leave them  marisha is there a town coming up or some place where we can quickly sell the horse and cart  taliesin or /town/ stow it  matt no there is the crispvale thicket ahead which has the crossroads but theres no town  there hupperdook behind you or honestly nogvurot or shadycreek run  marisha we lead the horse to water we force it to drink we give it some food hope it lives  liam we set it free  marisha maybe come back and find it  liam or its free or somebody gets a new horse  marisha we hang a sign on it free horse  sam why dont we kill it and take some meat all right lets /none/ just leave it  ashly i mean not to put a damper on it but if you leave a horse around here its probably going  to get killed theres a lot of shady folks around here  sam i mean the horses are all named after  marisha poop  sam poop so we can probably  matt so which one do you leave behind then  sam i believe were going to take wc loo john crapper and toilet but were going to leave loaf  laughter  taliesin so were going to drop a loaf  sam /none/ were going to drop a quick loaf then go its always better to drop a loaf before you go  taliesin lets leave a marker  ashly im starting to rethink my agreement to work with you guys  matt welcome to the mighty nein  taliesin if hes going to die we have to leave a marker so we can come back and find where hes  been interred  sam sure  taliesin poop joke  sam skidmark  matt as you say goodbyes to loaf  liam pinch him off  laughter  taliesin we squeezed about /town/ as much as we can out of that one  matt you strap your materials to the horses you are taking with you  taliesin its been a while  matt so youre going at a fast pace thats 30 miles  sam and marisha yep  matt you travel in day which will get you well within the crispvale thicket as you guys are  riding whos guiding this trip whos keeping an eye on the road ahead of you as you go  sam is one of us steering the journey and can another one of us be /town/ looking for clues or things  along the way  matt you can do that sure  taliesin i was going to say  marisha keg should lead  taliesin kegs been on this road before  ashly yeah can someone do me a favor does anyone have a piece of cloth or something theyre  not using  taliesin i have a giant dragon tapestry  ashly could i borrow that maybe  sam are you cold  matt this is the one thing you see strapped laying over the back of his horse this giant  rolled up /none/ thick blue and silver tapestry  ashly okay i wrap my head around it with it i should say so you cant really see my face  taliesin you now have a cape its huge  ashly okay  matt as you take the full tapestry or just a piece of it  taliesin i think the full tapestry  matt all right so yeah its you are just  sam swimming in it  matt yeah  sam why are you hiding your face  ashly i didnt leave with a lot of friends last time i was here /none/ so im trying to keep a low profile  taliesin youre well disguised as a stoners bedroom at the moment a dragon on a sheet  ashly perfect ill fit right in  matt there you go  ashly i guess i can lead since i know where im going  matt okay youve traveled this path before so its well known whos keeping watch  marisha ill keep watch  matt okay go ahead and make a perception check for me beau  marisha hopefully there are no more ones hiding in there  sam do you want to /none/ look at the thing the orb  marisha 18  sam okay youre good  taliesin yeah the orb we havent  sam we have to look at the orb at some point too or hexagon dexa  matt and taliesin dodecahedron  sam thank you  matt all right as youre heading down into the center part of the northern side of the marrow  valley keeping a look ahead you can see just as you crest over this one little embankment the  crispvale thicket ahead of you this beautiful cluster of darkgreen trees the clouds have  /dung/ completely taken the sky back and its this low gloomy gray as the air gets chilly as the day  progresses onward getting closer and closer to dusk you manage to get to the outskirts of the  thicket itself you see the trees growing thicker and the actual canopy of dark green pine trees  starting to gather you now have the opportunity if you want to you can travel into the crossroads  and head north or you can skirt around the forest off the path those are your because you  havent youre basically having to go /town/ to the center and then back north but youre on the road  the whole time or if you wanted to skip past it youll travel a little slower basically a  similar pace  sam but we wont encounter as many foes  matt well you dont know  sam okay  matt it just depends on your  sam are we trying to avoid people or  taliesin im more than happy to kill something at this point ive got some anger and aggression to  work out  marisha whats the faster route  matt make a /none/ survival check  marisha 12  matt looking about you gather the faster route would probably be to skirt around the outside of  the forest because you dont have to switch back even though the terrain isnt quite as well tread  however youve left the cart behind which means the one factor that wouldve really come into  that is no longer an issue  marisha were on horses lets just cut through  ashly do we get a sense of where theyre headed do we see any sign of  matt at this point in the main /town/ road there are a number of tracks whether it be horse foot and  cart and wheels of all different sizes youre not able to really tell whats the freshest from a  glance if you want to get off your horse and inspect you can try  ashly ill try would that be  matt that would be survival  ashly how good is my survival eh its okay a natty one  taliesin welcome to the team  ashly i dont even know what horses are anymore  marisha this is a donkey  matt you glance down /tavern/ from atop your horse you look down and see these smattering of patterns  and as you get down closer it just becomes dirt and you have no idea how to discern what came when  ashly im drunk that was pointless lets keep going  taliesin vomit sound  matt so which path do you guys wish to choose  sam caleb youre in charge which way are we going  taliesin oh for gods sakes  sam well hes so  liam which way are we going  marisha i say we go through the woods but youre /none/ the leader  liam i said you were the leader  sam caleb  liam im not a leader  taliesin oh for gods sakes im going to start going through the woods  matt so youre going through the thicket or around the outside of it  marisha sorry around the shortcut  matt okay so youre skirting the outside of the thicket  marisha yes  matt okay as you start cresting around the side of the forest within the first mile or so you  see an abandoned homestead maybe 200 feet or so away from the /none/ forest on the northern side it may  have been at one time a small farmhouse but part of the roof is caved in there once was a window  that had pane glass that has since been shattered and you can see jagged edges along the bottom side  of its sill  taliesin what time is it  matt right now id say its probably close to four or five in the afternoon you have a couple  hours before dusk really starts hitting  taliesin do we want to head a couple hours or have this unbelievably /none/ safe place what looks like  a very safe place although never mind were going to terrible things are just going to  happen im accepting it this is going to be a cursed trip do we want to stay in the haunted house  marisha do you want to send in frumpkin bird frumpkin see what he finds  liam does it look like frumpkin could make it through that window  matt frumpkin could yeah and its a one story farmhouse its a modest home single story maybe  from first glance three to four rooms and the /none/ partially collapsed roof on one side shows you  thats its been in disuse for some time who knows how weathered it may be on the interior  liam and what hour is it  matt about four or five in the afternoon  liam in the afternoon i dont see anything in there i mean you want to raid an old house or  keep going  marisha sleep in it is what were thinking  liam you want to cut for the day  sam we want to keep going dont we as fast as we can  /none/ taliesin well heres the question do we just go until we have to stop and then we camp wherever  were going to camp or do we find something like this which is possibly a little safer and then  just wake up very early and run and go further  ashly if you ask me keep going no place in this area is going to be safer than any other  marisha all right lets keep going  liam shes the local  taliesin trust the local  matt so you guys continue  marisha as we go by /none/ it were headed that way right  sam was there anyone in that house  matt you didnt get close enough to inspect  sam oh  marisha should we check it out and see if theres anything good  taliesin throw a falcon through the window  liam well thats what i was asking you described a window that was jagged glass ja  matt yeah  liam but if my smallish falcon went in there is he going to get cut up  matt you can certainly try  taliesin chimney  liam going to get cut  /none/ matt yeah frumpkins wingspan in this form is pretty wide wider than the window so frumpkin  would have to land on the window and then probably gingerly step in  taliesin or you could go through the chimney or the collapsed roof  ashly or i can just go in  taliesin we have  ashly keg just goes to the door and kicks it open  matt you guys watch as the horse rides off to the edge keg leaps off the horse  taliesin i like her  matt stomps up and just kicks the door open /none/ the door is already partially ajar so it creaks and  it falls off the top end and leans against the back inside of the farmhouse theres a brief  moment where you feel a couple things settle a slight creak and the fall of dust and as you step  inside you can see the furniture is in disarray there is a layer of dust everywhere there is a  smell of old rot and mildew and glancing inside you can see theres another window on the opposite  side thats also been busted out this place is pretty /none/ thrashed  ashly theres nothing in here  liam are there any books  taliesin im going to hop in there as well  sam ill go take a look  liam books  sam ill look for you  taliesin we always know to look  ashly im not going to look for boo oh god  matt are you looking for  ashly keg sits down on one of the pieces of furniture  taliesin i also want to see if theres does it look like people have been in here recently  matt well you make an /none/ investigation check on that and you make an investigation check to look  for things and if you want  ashly can i look for booze  sam 18  matt yeah go for it  taliesin nothing of value  ashly three  matt oh sadly no booze  ashly damn it  matt what did you roll  taliesin a two  matt hard to tell in this space  taliesin thats not fair  matt a lot of the furniture looks damaged some of it looks burned weirdly as you looking around  on the inside youre /none/ rummaging around for any possible books or anything that can be useful you  dont find any books you do manage to find a bundle of unused torches five you have a handaxe  thats a little old and rusted but its still functional its well made that was left under  one of the shelves that had fallen over and you find a mostly filled oil lantern while the glass  of the actual lantern is broken it still is pretty filled with oil so if you wanted to if  you had a container you could fill it /none/ and have a flask of oil  sam i have an extra flask  matt then you can go ahead and fill it with oil  sam i will fill that with oil  matt now you have a flask of oil at your disposal  sam nice  taliesin is there a crest on the fireplace or anything like that any markings of who might have  lived here at one point  matt no crests you glance and you do see a small iron symbol that looks like a star or sun  you recognize it to be /none/ the symbol of pelor it probably was a mantle of worship here but its  looking on it the metal looks scarred strangely its almost like elements of as you pick it up  and glance at it the pockmark scarring on it is strange and the mantle around it you can see a  lot of the wood and stonework seems to have been smoothed over in its damage  taliesin can i remove the piece  matt yeah it snaps off  taliesin im going to take it well this obviously brought luck to whoever was here  /none/ quietly i have a symbol of pelor  sam ill just go around and ask does anyone need any torches i found a bunch  marisha ill take a couple torches  taliesin ill take a torch  sam you can each have one  ashly sure ill take a torch  matt you get a torch and you get a torch  sam and how about a handaxe anyone  liam nein  marisha nah im good  taliesin caleb you want to do a little scan while were here see if anything tingles your fancy  liam sighs /none/ were killing time but yes i do i take the ten minutes to take the book out of the  holster and set it on the ground and while everyone just sits there in the dust i cast  detect magic  matt okay so how long does it take for that  liam ten minutes  matt ten minutes okay  liam wait wait  taliesin wait  matt wait  matt as a ritual i believe its ten minutes correct  liam yeah  matt all right so caleb youre having this moment where youre waiting as hes /none/ just poring  over this tome and drawing a circle on the ground and inscribing strange symbols in the air it  doesnt make any sense youre like ah magic stuff  ashly right  sam want another drink  ashly  taliesin yes  sam pouring noise  ashly thank you  taliesin bless you  matt everybody else roll a perception check if you dont mind  sam okay  taliesin ah  sam 13  taliesin 14  ashly 17  matt 17 what did you get  taliesin 14  ashly counting 19 actually  marisha /none/ 16  matt beau and keg you guys hear some noises out back the horses are getting a little restless and  nervous theyre like anxious chuffing and you see two of them are starting to clomp back a bit  away from the house starting to pull at the reins that have been hitched off to the side of the home  ashly hey you might want to finish your fairy shit theres something going on outside  matt at that point trying to take in what is sending these horses into a weird tizzy and you  feel /none/ this faint vibration in the ground this very subtle quaking  marisha im still outside on my horse so im going to ride around to the back of the house and  see if i see anything  ashly im going to run outside and see if i see anything  matt okay still utilizing the same perception checks you have looking in both directions  nothing there is youre maybe a little over a hundred feet or so from the tree line which is  what you were staying close to to not be out in the middle of /none/ the open field but you dont see  anything coming or going  taliesin ill pull a single sword and guard caleb  matt okay  marisha im going to jump off my horse and get on the ground and feel the ground do i feel any vibrations  matt you do theres this faint soft rumbling and it seems to be moving in shifts or in pulses  of intensity getting more intense and some of them longer and some of them shorter  marisha i were you going to keep going  matt no thats what youre sensing /none/  marisha i say get off the ground  taliesin all right  marisha and i run and im going to try and parkour up onto the roof of this thing  taliesin im going to try and push caleb awake and go for a tree  liam oh yeah i hear everything  taliesin yeah  liam okay what  taliesin lets go lets go and were going to head for a tree  matt okay you guys are headed for the trees  taliesin oh yeah  liam dispel the spell  matt spells lost molly and caleb /none/ start running out of the home to the tree line and youre just  going up on the roof  marisha is there a roof to be got upon  matt youre still on horseback you can jump off your horse  marisha no i jumped off my horse to feel the ground  matt right right so youre leaving your horse there and if you can try and look up on the  roof part of its collapsed you dont know the state its in but you can try  marisha ill get on my horse and head for /none/ the tree line with everyone else  matt okay galloping you start heading back to the tree line what are you guys doing  ashly so we cant tell if this is a creature or a we just can feel the ground rumbling  matt you cant you havent sensed anything everyone has just started getting nervous and  rushing for the tree line you can hear the faint rumbling and it is getting louder  marisha im going to take as i get closer to the tree line how far away am i  matt youre about 20 or /none/ so feet from the tree line  marisha okay im going to take my horse and im going to whip it around the opposite way going  away from us and im going to give it a good kick and jump off of it and head towards the tree line  with everybody else im going to head it away from us  matt okay your horse begins to head in a southward direction  ashly im staying where i am and im taking out my battleaxe and my warhammer im going come  out you piece of shit  /none/ matt so youre staying by the house  ashly yeah  sam im staying in the house and im going to cover myself up with some detritus of different  chairs and things near the window im hiding  matt make a stealth check  liam what are we running from  sam 13  matt caleb and molly you guys are riding towards the treeline  taliesin were getting some distance from whatever  matt first thing you notice is a splash of dirt to the south you see a small detonation out of  the earth in the /none/ direction of where your horse had been traveling off you see something emerge from  the ground and your horse ride up and hoof down and begin to run back in your direction away from  it it seemed to cut it off at the south as it is running towards you  marisha come on wc come on  matt you see something spray or splash in its direction as it turns and it whinnies in horrible  pain before it collapses onto the ground spinning  marisha water closet  sam aw  matt it lies there on /none/ the ground making this horrible squealing sound as youre watching  from what you can see in the distance its flesh burning  ashly is it dying  matt it looks in a really bad place at this point in time molly and caleb you hear the  vibration as the ground bursts to the right and left of you let me get the map since thats  where were going now  sam oh should we move this map  matt yeah were going to move this map out of the way  sam oh boy  taliesin oh /none/ man  ashly ah  sam oh gosh  ashly ah jeez  sam ashly welcome to the show  ashly hey thanks for

of the oh you were in the bar the bar was yes the ass sailor  liam i keep looking over at you and thinking im on the jerry lewis telethon  sam i thought we were all going to dress up tonight  matt there is caleb theres /none/ molly just on the outskirts of the forest this way bursting to  each side of you you see these large insectoid creatures that burst out of the dirt and ground  beau you are right over on this side as you left your horse on a southern direction there both  nott and keg are about 100 feet that direction  matt your horses are currently  ashly oh so they went after them  matt yeah  ashly oh  matt while you guys are over by the house you watch as this is going on and there /none/ doesnt  appear to be any action immediately near you so youre quite a distance away  ashly can i rush forward now  matt you can if your horse is still right by the no your horses rushed off towards the  taliesin her horse is still there  ashly i think my horse is still there  matt your horse is still there thats right you still have your horse there you can jump on your  horse and head that direction if you want to  ashly okay im going to do that  matt all right /none/ so you rush onto that i need everybody to roll initiative please because we  are now in combat  ashly god i think i spent all of my 20 juice on all these oneshots  sam you got that  ashly i know but its still a one  matt 25 to 20  marisha 20  matt beaus up first 20 to 15  taliesin 16  matt mollys up next 15 to ten  sam ten  taliesin its the antisnitch  sam negasnitch  matt caleb what did you get  liam drei

so i have this one in front of me oh man oh my god  matt theres a third one down that way thats maybe about 30 feet away from you that is heading  your direction its up to you if you want to pursue that or come help out your friends  marisha no im going to /none/ go for this one here i should have enough speed to clear it 40 feet  matt yeah you should yeah you can easily get there  marisha pop pop okay so first attack 15  matt 15 hits  marisha okay im going to spend a ki point to stun this thing and hopefully it doesnt save again  matt that is a six a five plus one it does not save  marisha its stunned finally  matt as you rush up to the side you look for what and what you see now at a close look /none/ is  this massive almost eight to nine feet tall to its head insectlike large cockroachtype creature  its chitinous armored body is segmented in places theres large antennae and these massive pincers  come out of its mouth with its strange insectoid eyes this gooey saliva thats dripping out of the  center of its mouth as it spins around towards you you see a moment where between its plates  and its body seems to be a soft musclelike underbelly you jam your fist in there and attack  and it seems to lock up its body for /none/ a moment roll damage  marisha oh right oh god i rolled a one in damage so thats plus four five damage im so nervous  matt all right so thats your first strike  marisha yeah then second strike thats a natural 14 so im pretty sure that hits plus  seven so 21 ooh thats an eight its the total other end of the spectrum i keep getting there  sorry my brain is all over the place 12 damage  matt nice the first strike ends up as just enough to cut past its defenses to stun /none/ it as  its reeling from the impact your other blow crack with your staff to the side hits it and  part of its armor cracks inward exposing more of its tender underbelly  marisha okay and then i am going to spend another ki point and do extract aspects  matt okay you want to learn three things from it what do you want to learn  marisha three things okay what is its dexterity modifier or its dexterity saving throw  matt dexterity saving throw is zero plus zero  marisha okay sorry dex zero what is /none/ its constitution saving throw  matt plus one  marisha does it have any vulnerabilities  matt no vulnerabilities  marisha okay i still have a bonus attack right  matt still have a bonus attack  liam oh wow the suspense  marisha 13  matt 13 technically your attacks have advantage while its stunned so you get to roll again  marisha oh thats right thats even worse  matt does not hit even while stunned you swing back with your fist and your knuckles glide off  of part of the armor that is still hardened and /none/ it hurts your knuckles and you pull back a second  but its not immediately able to do anything back at you thats your turn i believe  marisha yeah i yell to everybody and be like these guys dont seem very quick and shifty  sam okay  marisha not too dexy or anything they seem clumsy as fuck  matt all right that ends your turn  marisha it has shitty dexterity  matt molly youre up next  taliesin im going to try something fancy im going to tap my new fancy sword and im going to /none/  like a peppers ghost effect fade out and disappear and move right into what would be get  some advantage on the one that beaus been hitting  matt counting 30 so youre just out of range of it but you can use your movement to move up to it  taliesin ill use my movement to get right where i need to be  matt there you go  taliesin so i have advantage now  matt you do you watch as molly fades out of existence and then appears nightcrawler  teleportstyle right behind caleb  sam /none/ they killed molly  taliesin ill take two attacks  matt go for it  taliesin all right first one a natural one and an 18 yeah so one hits  matt yep  taliesin ooh thats ten damage plus three  matt so 13 damage  taliesin yeah 13 ten plus three next attack thats a 19  matt 19 hits  taliesin thats nine plus two so thats 11  matt 11 points of damage all right thatll do it with that you teleport next to it and carve  it asunder it screams as you slice through /none/ it all three times and you bisect it in the center of  where its thorax begins falls to the ground and crumples into pieces its greenish blood spilling  into the dirt and floor of the

deeper its looking pretty hurt but its still  standing anything else you wanted to do in your turn  ashly no im going to hang  matt youre going to hang back  sam youre going to keg stand there  ashly im going to keg stand there im proud of you sam  matt thats what happens when you get emmy award winners at /none/ the table you get that  ashly thats the height that we can accomplish though  matt

shoulder as you hear this sound you look in  the distance you see caleb who at this point has been this dirty hobo in the background all  of a sudden fire these three mystical arcane missiles that glow and arc off animemissile  style through the woods avoiding trees and all three slamming into the sides of this creature go  ahead and roll damage  liam thats a four and also counting six ive got to change this dice that is a ten total  matt ten total multiple impacts it sits there for a second /none/ after the impact leaving these large  craters in the side of its chitinous armor where its cracked and bits of liquid are spilling out  of it it looks heavily wounded but its still alive  liam was ist los  matt youre going to stay where youre put  liam i will go crouch by nott  matt revealing her position  sam hey get away from me no  liam i didnt make any noise i just sit down  matt thats all good that finishes calebs go beau youre up  marisha first attack 14  /none/ matt that

points of damage on the first hit  marisha yes  matt /none/ beau how do you want to do this as you and keg are both there clamoring on two sides of it  the image of yourself on the opposite end what do you want to do  marisha as i see keg bash it in a little bit of its insect armor i take my staff and i get up  under its exoskeleton and i start prying it off and i punch it to death  matt as you crowbar off a large part of its exterior insectoid armor skeleton it exposes this  horrible yellowish sinewy muscle interior /none/ as all the striations are pulling off of the armor as  its exposed it tries to go in to protect itself but youre too quick and you zero in and plunge  your fist into its body as it falls to the ground with a horrible sucking guttural slimy death and  pull it out  taliesin if you squeeze and twist you can make it stand up again and you can make the arms move  matt technically  liam singing hello my baby  ashly you guys nasty i like it  marisha does anybody have a /none/ wetnap  taliesin use the ground  sam im going to take off running after the horses to see if i can catch up with them  matt okay  marisha please check on water closet  taliesin this is a dead horse or can it be revived  matt you can go ahead and make a medicine check  taliesin im going to make a medicine check for my horse  liam does it have jesters shield on it  sam didnt we leave the shield  matt no the shield was strapped onto one of the horses  /none/ taliesin my medicine check is nine  matt youre not sure but it looks dire  ashly can i check  matt sure if you want to go ahead and step up to the horse make a medicine check  ashly 13  matt unless this horse gets some serious treatment its done  liam its suffering put it down  ashly i take my axe and i slam it down on its neck  matt instantly mercy killed  taliesin neigh  matt nott you do manage to catch up to the other horses they didnt go full sprint /none/ into infinity  they slowed down and once they got a safe distance from the action you manage to recover two of  them theres still your horse by the house you still have three horses  marisha check water closet  sam john crapper and toilet water closets dead  marisha oh hes very dead  matt you can go check  taliesin water closet is possibly new pocket jerky at this point  sam we can go check water closet i guess  matt go ahead and make a medicine check as you approach  sam that would /none/ be a three  matt water closet looks not long for this world  sam im going to try to cut out the tongue maybe thats something i can eat later  matt okay water closet is still technically holding onto life  sam ugh i dont know that  matt no water closets final horrible moment is its riders cutting its tongue out  sam sobbing  ashly why do you hang out with this guy lady  marisha he came up with this one they were a package deal  ashly why do you hang out with it /none/  liam she is extremely useful  ashly at cutting out horse tongues  sam eating noises  liam among other things yeah  ashly thats the most fuckedup shit ive ever seen and i grew up in shadycreek run  marisha we have three horses and theres five of us  matt correct  marisha can we double up  matt its possible  marisha nott doubles up with caleb  sam maybe the two smalls should  ashly im not going on a horse with her  sam what ive bonded with its essence now  ashly im /town/ not going on a horse with her  taliesin keg can ride with me this is not a problem if you want  ashly yeah thats fine  sam ive got the booze  ashly you know for the first time in my life im willing to sacrifice booze  liam scared straight  ashly scared straight you can take that shit on the road  taliesin youre already taking a good hard look at your decisions this is good  matt as you guys begin to try and work out your arrangements and the horses unfortunately due to  /none/ the heavy nature of your armor and the broad form and heavy body of keg it looks like you wont be  able to fit keg and one other individual on a horse but there are other combinations that might work  marisha nott team up with caleb  taliesin ill ride with you then  sam would that work  taliesin you get your own horse  ashly ay  marisha can me and molly team up  matt you and molly can do it yeah  marisha okay  taliesin i have their armor  sam wait we /none/ have three yeah okay  taliesin yeah thatll do it  matt kegs about as dense as two of you  taliesin thats fair  laughter  sam i noticed back there that you were using your hands and weapon stuff and things youre not a  healer or anything  ashly you cracked the case my man  taliesin truly nothing escapes your astute observation  sam you dont have any potions of healing or anything that could maybe heal someone if anyone  needing healing would  ashly who needs healing  sam no one now but in /town/ the future its a frequent occurrence for us  taliesin going to go back to that cabin and take a short rest for a minute  sam do any of us have any potions  marisha i have a potion  liam i have a potion i start to look to see what jesters got inside the haversack other than the  dodecahedron and our tent  matt unless i am mistaken  sam she had a greater healing potion however i dont know if she had that on her or kept it in  the sack  taliesin it /none/ would have been in the sack  liam she had a heroes feast in there i think  matt im going to go ahead and check one element of this because it will  sam i think we have her notebook in the locker  taliesin do you want me to go look at the locker  marisha yeah her notebook might even be  sam no i felt around in there  marisha oh it might be in the locker then  ashly what time is it now after all the bugbattling  matt the battle was pretty quick /none/ you still have probably another hour and a half two hours  before sundown  ashly of daylight is there anything to harvest from those bugs  matt if you want to go ahead and take a shot at trying  sam did the light just change in here  matt yeah  marisha it was in battle mode did you notice  ashly ooh fancy  taliesin look at the fancy  sam the light is moving  matt new toys  taliesin and marisha new toys  matt ive wanted to have a setup like that since high /none/ school and now i can  marisha 12  matt youve never encountered these creatures you dont have much of an understanding of their  anatomy beyond the experience you had extracting the aspects from them which actually would give  you a little better idea of their physicality in some places because you looked at their  constitution and dexterity ill say that you know that the tendons and some of the muscle sinew that  they use in the inside of their body is very strong and very tight and can be used as cording  it can /none/ be used for anything that would involve a very strong piece of cord or rope  marisha what about their acidic venom situation their venom sacs  liam caleb comes up behind  matt that could possibly be harvested its a dangerous process you can certainly try  marisha like i might die trying  matt i dont know you can certainly try its trying to carefully remove a giant sac of natural  acid from a creatures body you want to roll the dice  taliesin are you feeling lucky punk  liam hold on here theres the dodecahedron /none/  marisha okay  matt all right well you have to pull it out you have to remove it  marisha i did  sam just stare back  matt you watch as they pull this pack out and beau reaching in pulls out this strange  12sided construction it looks like its some sort of an opaque crystal almost like a marble  type of color its grayish and its undulating with some slight pulsing light like a faint  heartbeat with these golden handles affixed to it as she pulls it out and begins to focus on it /dung/  theres this moment of distant meditation before she comes back with a breath and places it back  in its a strange sight  ashly youre all into some freaky shit  liam made by gnomes  marisha okay  matt do you have a blade to harvest  liam i have a dagger here use mine  marisha i do have a dagger  liam i shoot out the globules of light to float around the corpse  marisha and i put my goggles on safety first  liam its very bright super bright  matt super bright /none/ right now  marisha pull up the hood and i buckle myself up i take my scarf from around my waist and tie it  around me for a facemask  liam you can do this and i walk twenty feet back  matt i will say because of your understanding of its body from extracting the aspects of it do you  wish to utilize nature or medicine for this roll giving you the choice  marisha medicine its higher  matt go ahead and make your check  marisha just a straight check  matt just a straight /none/ check skill check with medicine bonus whatever that may be  marisha natural 20  ashly and taliesin whoa  taliesin finally  marisha im back  matt youve seen beau be pretty precise in combat and pinpointing the weak elements of an opponents  body this is almost poetry the surgical precision in which beauregard takes the dagger and  cuts pulls rips pulls and lifts tucks finds cuts removes and within a matter of about a  minute a minute and a half there is a sac about the size of a basketball the ends have been tied /none/  off and feels like a water balloon  ashly keg is aroused  marisha got the sac now what do you have any more flasks or anything to put it in  sam i have a couple of empty vials but theyre small ive worked with chemicals before i could  try to put this acid in the vials and stopper them  marisha if we poke if you have a little tube or something that is straw a little bamboo straw  put it in there and go down  sam sure would three vials of acid be /none/ useful to us  marisha i think it would be useful to you for sure  sam sure all right ill try to make a little needle prick in the bladder and try to pour them  into these vials that i got from the gentleman  marisha can i help with my natural 20  matt make a dexterity check just a straight dexterity check  sam okay thats 16  matt thats good you do not just puncture a balloon while looking directly at it you manage  to find one of the areas that taper within this /none/ organ whatever it is that was removed and manage  to siphon it off in a way where you can fill the rest of your vials however many empty vials you have  sam i have three from the gentleman  matt yeah you have three vials of acid now  sam okay great would you like one you did this  marisha i think theyre better to be used on your bolts and things like that  sam i dont know how i would put it on there  marisha cant he  matt its more of a tossed /none/ weapon or used to dissolve things  sam why dont you take one  marisha all right ill take one  sam molly do you want some acid do you want to drop some acid  taliesin i feel like if you give it to me im going to end up dropping it and its not really  going to be that useful  sam caleb do you want  liam youre far more dexterous than i  sam how about ill give you two and ill keep one since i already have one that i made  ashly you /none/ didnt ask me if i wanted some acid  liam are you dexterous  ashly yeah  liam show us  ashly 15 i do a back flip i dont know  laughter  ashly its acrobatics but fuck it  liam id say she earned one yeah  sam all right here you go  ashly thank you  sam are we friends again  ashly were we ever  laughter  taliesin im very happy  matt you guys have taken a short time its taken about half an hour or so for you to go  through /none/ this process of extracting that and carefully filling these vials and discussing  amongst yourselves who would get what you have about an hour until dusk hits  taliesin i say we just camp at the house at this point i need rest and we have not going to get  much further  marisha its fine with me you guys fine with that  liam short rest you said sorry was reading my book  taliesin i say we wake up early its going to be dusk in less than an hour  ashly the house feels a little /town/ exposed to me  taliesin well  ashly plus all the weird buggy guys were around there if there are more they would come back  liam im sorry did we get any horses just enough to fit us all on condensed right  sam what time is it sorry  matt about an hour until dusk  sam oh well we can make some more headway on the road and then go at full dark we could camp  at full dark  taliesin wherever we happen to find ourselves  ashly are we within range of the forests /none/  matt yes about here is where the forest begins and that is where you began your confrontation  youre right on the edge of the forest  liam i think we should continue to make time as well  marisha okay can i climb a tree and do i see anything on the horizon in where were going like  another tree clearing that looks like it might be up ahead  matt make an athletics check  marisha athletics  matt yes  marisha 24  sam jesus  marisha rolled an 18  matt like a monkey /none/ that was raised in the jungle you watch beauregard leap from branch to bough  effortlessly diving through this forest  ashly keg is aroused  marisha whatever you cast on me caleb is like i feel so good  matt and liam its gone  marisha but the lingering effects you know im in the afterglow  matt the afterglow of haste  taliesin it was just tea we just gave you tea to smoke it wasnt really  laughter  taliesin herbal tea man just chamomile tea  marisha so relaxed  matt you make it up into /none/ the canopy make a perception check  marisha okay 17  matt even at the tallest tree most around you all you can see are other trees of varying  heights looking in the northeast direction beyond where you just came from you can see the  house you can see bits of natural rock that maybe had either been left by some longago volcanic  detonation in the distance or pushed up through the ground by tectonic movement youre not sure  you see elements of stone that have broken through bits of the grass and open fields part /town/ of the  natural fields here you havent actually traveled this far north so its unfamiliar topography to  you youve only heard about it but its interesting to see that the further north you get  the more rocky the terrain seems to get in the direction youre traveling you do see far in the  distance what could possibly be the road that youre getting to but its a ways off to get to  that direction  marisha i climb back down i say we gather some branches some scrap wood for firewood in case  this /town/ might be the only forest we come across in a while see as far as we can get maybe we can hide  under a rock for shelter or something  taliesin ive still got my tent so sure  marisha i shoved one in the haversack too  taliesin all right  matt you guys continue for the next hour or so skirting along the forest  marisha i gathered some stuff  liam as they leave caleb scooches frumpkin on the head and says you know she always forgets  about you but i do not  marisha /dung/ its such a quiet bird im used to very loud birds  matt you guys gather some kindling get back to your three horses and your comparatively  uncomfortable riding arrangement and continue on for another hour on the outside of the forest  before the sun does eventually vanish the graying sky is getting darker and darker the faint bits  of orange that poke through its not a beautiful sunset you only catch the faint hues that manage  to push through the gloom but the sky grows dark enough to the point where you think you should /none/ set  up camp are you setting up camp at the edge of the forest on the inside of the forest on the  outside of the forest whats your preference  liam off inside i think  ashly yeah i think inside as well  matt okay you guys set up camp whos keeping first watch  liam i will  taliesin ill also do first watch  liam i will begin it by putting out the silver thread around the group  matt you guys want to both individually roll perception or one aid the other with the /none/ help action  sam help action  liam individual  taliesin individual  liam because i cant decide  matt go for it  taliesin natural 20  liam better than my 16  matt plus  taliesin oh plus three 23  matt all righty as everyones settling in begins to find their initial portions of rest you  guys have your small fire there on the edge molly you glance off deeper into the forest  and your eyes even at this distance catch a faint glimmer of matching flame you see a faint  bit of firelight /none/ sparkling about 200 feet deeper into the forest  taliesin theres another theres another campfire  liam how far

ashly yeah it really was  matt one two three fuck you as frumpkin begins  owl hooting  sam what the fuck was that matt there was an owl that just hooted on the soundtrack  matt yeah were /dung/ in a forest at night guys frumpkin makes his way through the dark tree  bottoms eventually coming upon actually this would be a more creepy setting for this i think  thats better frumpkin slowly comes upon the warmth of this distant fire closer and closer  until coming around the corner seeing a small fire heating a cauldron of some kind some metal  bowl a bit of steam is rising off of whatever liquid is in the interior you see an elderly  woman in darker tattered clothing that drapes off of the body hunched but tall /none/ very tall like six  and a half feet tall at a hunch make a perception check for frumpkin please at this distance with disadvantage  liam with disadvantage  matt yes  liam okay perception you said 14  matt the skin of this woman is a faint gray color almost a grayblue tint the hair is this  matted mess of tangled white and gray that is pulled back and tied behind the head where it  cascades over the shoulders the ears are long and pointed out to the sides a bit the nose is wide  /none/ and pressed up into the face she is going back and forth from this little hovel thats on the  opposite side thats built between two trees a large thick one and another that seems to have  fallen and come to rest at an angle next to it in that small cranny between the two trees you can  see this little hut built of thatch and sticks and rope to construct this little home its almost  like an arch thats holding it up near the ground of this cauldron you see a child of some kind  /none/ that is sitting on the ground holding knees to its chest it looks to be a boy  liam knees to chest  matt yes  liam okay she is paying him no mind at the moment  matt at the moment no it looks like she is going to and from this little homestead and  putting things into this cauldron  liam i whisper in fragments what i saw through frumpkins eyes the whole time but im still  looking and i cant hear anybody  marisha do you have any awake  taliesin just us  liam /none/ oh right i would be holding onto molly this is reminding me of stories that my mother  told me when i was very young not good ones things to scare me into following the rules i  come out of it  taliesin a child  liam and a woman or not  taliesin that does have a vibration doesnt it im not at my best right now if theyre human  even if theyre friendly im not the first face youd want to see  liam quickly have to think here because everyone else is sleeping and that /none/ didnt look  good for that little boy but then it doesnt really help us with what we are doing but then  the child what to do  taliesin you have a friendly owl  liam i go back into frumpkin to see whats going on  matt okay you watch now as the woman takes a small clay cup and dips it into this cauldron and  pulls out this steaming mass of liquid that shes contained within it turns to the child walks  over and kneels down beside places the long fingers along the shoulder and /none/ hands the cup to  the child the child takes it looking at her and slowly sips from it burns the mouth a little bit  liam i swat at molly and say wake the others  taliesin fine i start quietly waking  marisha sam and ashly what what  taliesin i somehow woke everyone at the exact same time its one of my many powers  sam we were all spooning  taliesin left hand right hand tail i got it all working at once weve got a bit of a  situation outside  sam where  /none/ taliesin its going to require some delicacy  sam is caleb gone  taliesin calebs dead its all over  sam no  marisha youre looking at him  sam okay i didnt know if he was a phantom or something  ashly whats going on  taliesin theres a boy theres an old woman  liam im not sure but i think there is a young child thats in danger there we seemed to care  about the bird child maybe we care about this one i dont know  sam of course  ashly why do we give /none/ a shit  sam its a baby  ashly ah fuck  liam we got to act right now  ashly what does the woman look like  marisha im going to groggily stumble over put on my googles as i start stumbling towards the light  liam she looked dead she did not look natural  taliesin im going to stay 30 feet behind and try and stealth  matt beauregard youre leading up  marisha yeah im going to walk and im like its bright enough and i got to pee anyway ill  be right back  /none/ matt so not stealthing  sam maybe you should not go first  marisha okay no ill stealth a little bit  matt roll a stealth check beau  marisha okay that was almost good 11  matt who else is following beau  sam im going to not follow but go off to the side and try to go around the other way  matt stealth check from you  taliesin we have not had a short rest yet have we  matt nope  taliesin okay just checking  liam a short rest i thought we did back /none/ at the house  matt a short rest you didnt call it out  marisha but he was on first watch  liam i happily went i get to use arcane recovery in my head because of the conversation  that was happening  matt i will allow a short rest before you guys went to bed its fine ill allow it  sam 16  liam thank you matt  matt the two of you have branched off and are stealthing you think what are you doing caleb  liam i wanted to go with nott about 20 feet /none/ behind and cast mage armor as i go  matt okay and whats your stealth check  liam it is a big ten  matt okay what are you doing keg  ashly i pick up my battleaxe and theres a little medallion hanging from the bottom of it and i look  at it and i go goddamn it and i try to stealth after them natural 20  matt you have disadvantage however in your armor  ashly natural 20  all whoa  taliesin that die never does that for me  liam you did this last /none/ time youre not human  matt the antiwheaton has been found  liam you cant come back  matt you can never touch wil wheaton or you guys will cancel each other out like the bad guy in  time cop oh my god strangely the stealthiest of all of you is the dwarf in plate armor  marisha amazing its lubricated with all the blood of her enemies  matt exactly all right molly youre staying 30 feet back  taliesin im staying 30 feet back and attempting a stealth check thats cocked thats better  thats counting 12 /none/  matt you all slowly begin to approach this fire seeing the shapes and the figures described by  caleb previously beau you step forward and your foot catches an under root and stumble for a  moment you hear the scrambling of her arms across the bottom of the forest floor the moving and  shifting of leaves and branches the old woman looks up in that direction and looks back at you  immediately making eye contact with you about 30 feet away her arms immediately jump up in your  direction as she begins to shout you /none/ you will not take any more of us i will sooner die  marisha i reach back out to her and i go yes right we are so going to die im with you  matt make a wisdom saving throw  marisha saving throw  matt yes  marisha 15  matt you feel some sort of magical force suddenly penetrate your mind and this sparkle of colors  begin to spray in front of your face that completely distract you and obscure your vision  momentarily but you blink out of it and find the effect drift off /none/ of your brain the old woman goes  panting and reaches down and puts herself in front of the boy between you and the child  marisha yeah im not bad im not one of the bad guys that you were definitely talking about  that im aware of right what bad guys are you talking about  matt make a persuasion check  marisha okay  liam ooh thats craziness  marisha thats in the middle of nowhere okay 18  matt her immediate tension drops slightly shes still maintaining a very defensive position in  front of the /none/ child one hand is still up but it seems that shes pulled back a bit from the  aggressive stance she was previously in as she lifts her face a bit you can see a bit more of  her expression in the light as the hair pulls away as she lifts her chin you can see that the face  is humanoid but with a wider nose the skin is grayish almost a blue tint with bits of a soft  fur it takes you a second to recognize where youve seen these features before this appears to  /none/ be the same type of race that pumat sol is  marisha firbolg  matt it is a firbolg  marisha amazing  matt you can see there is a series of necklaces that looks to be bones and rocks and stones that  have been polished that dangle around her neck as adornments and trinkets a few bird skulls hanging  on it as well the child also you see is a young firbolg as well knees tucked against his  chest you can see that the child looks scraped up and bruised and appears to have been injured /none/  marisha i say bad guys kidnapping kids right thats scary stuff trying to protect your son  matt not my son but we have lost a few yes  marisha who  matt looks past you for a second to molly who is not being stealthy either how many are you  taliesin one two three four five  marisha currently five  taliesin five  marisha but just call us the nein the mighty nein  matt very well  marisha here m nein whistles  taliesin im just walking out at this point  sam ill slowly /none/ emerge from the shadows  ashly im staying in the forest  liam same  matt okay i apologize ive been on edge for a number of days you seem to know these people or  have heard of them at least  taliesin weve lost a few recently  matt im sorry i am jumnda im a healer in my aged years for the guiatao clan we are small in  number and now yet smaller still  marisha the guitaya clan  matt guiatao  marisha guai  matt guiatao  marisha guiatao clan  matt this little /none/ one is umbo he is awake now which is good fortune ive been trying to bring  him back to health for a couple of days  marisha you say hes not your son but part of your clan  matt yes he is under my care now  marisha is the whole clan wiped out whos left  matt the woman jumnda looks around for second and takes a deep breath three days back the  clan was in celebration for the coming of age for young duma roasted boar was prepared and the  twenty of us were /none/ dancing around the fire when the murderers came slew toffah and wolya with their  arrows as they danced together others fought fennis died protecting me and i managed to grab  ombo here as he had been beaten within an inch of his life to unconsciousness we fled but i  watched as they grabbed others in nets pulling them away as they screamed and yet made no noise  you know exactly who and what shes talking about the methods are very familiar when they left i  returned to nurse those i could back to health nila /none/ by some luck was off when the attack  happened she returned to find her love and child taken  matt nila went off to find them alone i begged her to stay else she join their fate but its  impossible to stop a mother when the child is in danger so i fear for her life but i understand  her drive so here i am here he is and a few survivors care to what remains of our village a  ways back that direction she points deeper into the forest so you know my story whats /none/ yours  marisha other half of our party members were taken from us in the middle of the night just  last night seems very similar ways considering neither of the rest of us heard anything  taliesin just woke up and they were gone  matt they were lucky  taliesin well see  matt had you been awake you might have had the urge or instinct to defend them  taliesin well were making our way to see if something can be done  marisha yeah  matt well youre as brave as nila  marisha nila shes /none/ the one going after them  matt she was i dont know where she is or if she has fared well if theyve found her i think  she overestimates her capability  marisha what was her sons name  matt her son was dua  ashly can i do an insight check just to make sure that shes telling the truth  matt you may  ashly 15  matt 15  sam taliesin and marisha whispers  sam guys dd beyond is a wonderful platform in which you can organize your statistics and your  equipment and theyve /dung/ just recently done a revamp of their layout liam how do you like it  liam i like it it feels like i am looking at the paper  sam and its customizable  liam its customizable i havent customized mine yet  ashly were talking about dd beyond  liam always  sam nice  liam yes keg we are  ashly i heard its a wonderful service  matt well if we indeed have an enemy in common you are welcome to stay with us and she glances  across you i can perhaps maybe tend to some /none/ of your wounds we have tea thats ready that may  help you in your journey ahead  taliesin i genuinely dont know how to say no to tea  marisha you couldnt bring a horse back from the dead could you just didnt know how far your  abilities stretch  matt im afraid that is beyond my capability  taliesin you cant heal a dead horse  marisha water closets gone forever  sam yes  taliesin downtrodden  marisha he saved our lives a lot laughing downtrodden  sam stop whispering bastard  ashly keg comes out /town/ from the forest  sam ah i forgot you were with us  ashly thanks a lot nott what are we doing here  sam well these people have suffered the same fate that our frie  ashly we going to help every single person we see along this road  sam were mutually were going after the same people that have affected them  liam yelling we were going to camp back there but instead we are going to camp over there  marisha thats caleb he always stands about 20 feet back  liam yelling at least  /none/ matt well if there are more of you they are welcome as well i do not know if i have enough  tea for everyone if there is more but  taliesin im feeling all right but  liam its just the five neins  ashly so youre just offering us a place to stay you dont want anything out of this  matt no  ashly all right  sam some people are just good  taliesin some people make tea im going to head in  marisha can you do anything about this acid burn and i sit /none/ down next to her  matt i see that you have encountered some of the ankheg variety  marisha oh they are called ankhegs you guys  sam related to you  ashly no nott keep trying you little detective youll get it one day  sam the subject seems to be exhibiting signs of distress or at least annoyance  ashly annoyance  matt you gather over to their space its a nice livedin space you get the sense this is the home  for this medicine woman who doesnt live directly with the rest of the village she /none/ inspects your  wounds has some balms and natural remedies to help prevent infection the tea while it is not  necessarily delicious by any means it is very herbal and medicinal it does fill you with a  sense of rest and relief and what restlessness you may have been struggling with through a  nights rest is absolved  marisha and taliesin chamomile  matt as you guys manage to say here for the evening you get the benefits of a long rest you  come to consciousness now in the morning day which is a little more /none/ peaceful  taliesin i have cards we could have played cards  matt you awaken over by the fire the little boy ombo is sitting there currently with these two  small wooden pikes that are jammed into the side and some squirrellike critters that are hanging  on them that are put towards the fire cooking as you awaken ombo turns and smiles doesnt say  anything but looks over and inspects them and then brings them back and hands them out to you  sam its breakfast  taliesin i will definitely take some  sam ill take /none/ one yes thank you  liam do you understand what i am saying do you speak is his ward awake  matt you dont see her at the moment but you do hear a bit of rustling in the actual little hovel  in the tree archway  ashly can i make a perception check around to make sure everything is copacetic  matt you can  ashly 16  matt you notice that the horses have actually been brought closer theyve been hitched together  to one of the local stumps to the circle here it seems that in /none/ your rest your very deep rest  through the evening a lot of things have been tended to and taken care of in your presence  taliesin theyve got turndown service here  matt as part of your long rest and the tea which you took in the evening you do have advantage on  perception checks for the next eight hours  liam i bring frumpkin without saying a word telepathically i have frumpkin come down in front  of the child and do a little owl nonsensical shimmy dance on the ground just for ten seconds  to /none/ catch his attention then have frumpkin flutter up and land on his head and gently find purchase  and sit  matt okay he freezes on the arrival  liam i smile  matt he seems to smile again looking up at you looking up at frumpkin stays frozen in place at  which point the doorway opens from the hut and jumna emerges with a small pouch of some kind  steps up to the rest of you i see you have awoken i know youll be on your way shortly but  maybe this can help she pulls /none/ back the top of the leather pack and reaches in and pulls out a  cluster of moss that has been dried and holds it out to whoevers closest or wishes to take it  liam mollymauk will take that  taliesin always  sam what does it do  matt should you find yourself in a wounded state this should help you with some rapid  recovery of the wounds it acts as a greater healing potion but it takes a minute to  administer so its a noncombat scenario  sam do you smoke it  matt no /none/ it is crumbled and then ingested you can also put some in the actual wounds if you  like but it is meant for ingestion  sam see people are just nice sometimes  ashly never in my experience  liam only sometimes  taliesin do you know which way this friend of yours was heading to find them it was north on  the path i suppose  matt just north is what i know north northeast  taliesin well see what we can do  matt if you find her and whatever state you find her if its /none/ not a good state will you promise  me to at least bring her back so we can give her a proper burial  ashly this aint part of my deal  taliesin if its possible well see what we can do  matt thats all i can ask  taliesin all things being equal  matt anyway i thank you ombo thanks you and  taliesin i look at the kid is he freaked out by the way i look is he  matt no not at all  taliesin im going to go down and try something  /none/ matt he does have a giant owl on his shoulder and is currently preoccupied with the owl  taliesin im going to try this i havent tried this yet im going to hold up the moon card and  im going to try and do a sleight of hand trick and flip it to one of my little moon trinkets  moon baubles  matt ooh make a sleight of hand check  taliesin it would be the most hilarious natural one eight  matt eight okay it happens but  taliesin its not beautiful yet  matt the trick /dung/ is very visible what you did the kid still seems amused  taliesin i give him the bauble  matt smiles frumpkin ruffles his feathers looks a bit spooked  taliesin i give him a little scratch the horses  sam yes we should keep going to find their friends  liam thank you both  matt thank you for hopefully doing some good in a very dark world  liam well dark business at hand  sam do you know someone named pumat sol  matt uh that does not ring a bell  sam how about one of /none/ his friends pumat sol or pumat sol or pumat sol  matt i apologize i do not  sam i just thought maybe they knew each other  liam they all know each other  sam i dont know how many of these there are  sam me im  liam do you know a goblin named furgle burgle  sam no i dont know every goblin theres lots of goblins i never all right all right point  taken point taken  laughter  matt as you guys gather your things get the horses ready ombo approaches and gives /none/ a little  wave you watch as jumma approaches from behind and rests her hand on his shoulder looks up to  you and says please be safe  marisha well try thank you man normally fjord is here to do this part  sam no that was really good  taliesin you did very well  liam that is the best you ever did  marisha thank you that does feel good i did something today  taliesin you were nearly charming  matt charming adjacent  marisha all right we leave  liam as we leave frumpkins head /none/ does that crazy owl thing that goes 180 and flips around and just  looks as  matt as you vanish into the treeline ombo the child seems transfixed by the owls behavior  before disappearing behind the trees and you guys find your way back to the open fields of the  northern marrow valley so now back on horseback what pace are you traveling at are you still  going at a fast pace  liam we are wellrested  marisha weve already lost two of our horses why not lose a few more  taliesin were the /none/ three amigos is really  liam now all of us know ooh i went vax all of us know what you already knew which is yes  still hurts that these people are terrible and deserve no mercy  sam not the firbolgs we just met right you were talking about the people who kidnapped our friends  liam what do you think  sam i think were still talking about the people who kidnapped our friends  taliesin everybodys doing so much better suddenly its as if the vacuum means other people  have to start pulling some slack /none/ its nice  marisha what  taliesin well suddenly youre being kind of charismatic notts making moralistic judgments  that are in the direction of reasonable  sam sure sure  ashly i will say that i dont want to get hung up trying to help those people while were in shady run  liam oh you know if we can were not altruistic by nature either  ashly all right  marisha you know if we stumble upon one of them maybe be like hey met your grandma  taliesin some days its not hard to do a good /none/ turn  liam but lets be clear were going to eliminate the problem  taliesin cheers  liam save our friends and if we can do something extra we do something extra when we can  sam and maybe even complete our mission  taliesin id forgotten about that  marisha i know thats a big deal that whole mission completing thing  taliesin been a little distracted  marisha yeah  liam all right lets run these bastards down ja  matt all right are you going at a normal pace or a fast pace  marisha fast pace /none/  sam at a fast pace matthew im on horseback with caleb right could i be on the back maybe  just flipping through jesters sketchbook  matt sure  sam okay im going to look through the whole thing  matt all right it is absurd there are sketches across the spectrum of sillyfaced interpretations  and caricatures of the people youve met of each of you there are little notes to the traveler  throughout you see people that youve liked in the past looking beautiful with tiny bodies you  see people who youve hated in the /none/ past getting stepped on by a poop monster its childish in all  the delightful ways that youd expect from jesters capability  sam is it all drawings are there any notes or letters or clues to her past  matt there are notes pause i will say laura is not here to specify necessarily that there are  passages in common to the traveler what languages do you know  sam common goblin halfling  matt and there are a number of passages in a language you dont understand meatier passages  longer ones  taliesin if only there /none/ were a tiefling here who possibly spoke and read the same language  liam or a wizard who can read anything  liam and taliesin keep it to yourself  sam keep it to myself yelling keep steering caleb im looking at nudie pictures  matt so you carry on at a pretty good pace and youre traveling rather swiftly though traveling  at this speed its harder to perceive things at a distance thankfully this renewed vigor from the  tea that you had for the evening may help you in that endeavor as well so who is keeping /none/ watch on  the roads ahead of you  liam i am  matt all right go ahead and make a perception check with advantage and minus five to whatever you  liam so advantage minus five on both  matt correct  liam okay thats not good thats a one okay that means i got a seven  matt okay then  marisha seven  liam at advantage minus five on both the rolls i rolled a nine and a one so hey  matt for the next eight hours or so you guys continue on the trek on /town/ the outskirts of the  crispvale thicket eventually coming to meet up with the glory run road that heads northward to  the direction of nogvurot you can see theres a road sign that specifically points up to nogvurot  southward to the crossroads following the map and the path youve charted out in your experience as  well you travel for quite a ways along glory run and then just head straight north towards the  quannah breach so youll be going off into just grassland and scrubland at a certain point  taliesin offroading  matt essentially about /none/ then eight hours hit you have another hour or so before the sun begins to  go down you can continue to push for another hour if youd like to and all take constitution saving  throws its up to you  liam if we do the one more hour its constitution checks  matt you can do the one more hour or you can stop and set an early camp and get another  evenings rest but you do not spot anything along the way its a beautiful open field  liam im sharp i should always do this /none/  sam are we getting close to where you think their headquarters are  ashly how far do we have to shadycreek  matt you probably have maybe two days more travel before you get there  ashly im down to push the other hour but my constitution is clicks tongue  marisha im down as well but  taliesin lets do it  liam same  marisha and in that hour we can look for a place to rest its like pushing for the next rest stop  liam yes one more we push it one more hour  /none/ taliesin do we want to go at a steady pace for this last hour or do we want to push for a fast pace  liam fast equals a constitution check right  matt no you travel for another hour of additional movement which will get you probably  another six miles ahead then well see if you get a point of exhaustion  sam lets do it  matt you push for the ninth hour i need you all to make constitution saving throws please  marisha can we look for a good camping spot  ashly natural 20 /dung/  marisha oh shit  liam natural 20 i dont want to hear it  taliesin natural 19 21  sam 13 total  marisha 18  liam eight  ashly oh no  matt caleb you take a point of exhaustion the rest of you do not  liam sweet this is my first what happens to me do i die on the spot  marisha disadvantage on your checks  matt on ability checks thats all  taliesin and youre hangry  liam thats my secret taliesin im always hangry  matt as the sky grows dark the /none/ still gray clouds that have taken the sky overhead the temperature  is dropping significantly it looks like its going to be a particularly cold night do you wish  to continue pushing on  marisha along the way do we see anything that looks like a good alcove or somewhere that would  be nice  matt make a perception check  marisha which we have advantage on right  liam eight hours and you said the eight hours was  matt youve push now past hour nine so you cannot have advantage  marisha a six and oh /none/ no advantage ill take that six with my add perception of three so nine  matt nine  marisha nein  matt best you can find looking around there are a few small boulders or pieces of natural rock  formations that have pushed up out of the local hills as you are moving through this more hilly  area of the northern valley but theres no alcoves or caves that youre catching a vision of  that would give you safe and out of the public eye  taliesin does it look like if we push a little bit /none/ further theres any change in terrain  matt theres only one way to find out  taliesin even in far distance  matt you can travel for another hour  liam yeah theres a way to do that  taliesin want to do one more hour and call it  ashly or owl boy  marisha hes hangry  liam we could push it too im good  taliesin lets send the owl  liam okay five minute little flyahead  matt okay make a perception check  liam i hold on to my horse and stop hearing everybody disadvantage /dung/  matt its the owl technically not him  liam its terrible its perception was that what i was doing five  matt at this distance it looks like its straight moving rolling hills and bursts of stone  liam its getting dark out here and im tired  taliesin if we can find a stone for cover maybe  ashly ill take watch  taliesin well set up a proper camp  sam ill take watch with keg  ashly great  liam before i go to sleep i do the silver thread  matt first watch is you /none/ two do you wish to combine your perception checks for this watch or  take them individually  ashly no  matt roll individually  sam 13  ashly ten  matt first watch manages to go by you both keep a very sharp eye out in the distance nothing  seems to catch your attention though the night is getting quite cold towards the end of your watch  snowfall begins to slowly descend upon the northern valley  sam chilly sure glad i have all this booze to drink to keep me warm wouldnt you like some  /none/ ashly i have 200 pounds of pure muscle i never get cold  sam well it tastes good though so theres that too  ashly why you trying to cozy up to me  sam im not trying to cozy up to you i think we got off on the wrong small feet  ashly you mean when you bared your teeth at me four times  sam i have to bare my teeth at everyone look at these things theyre huge  ashly you have no choice  sam no i have very thin lips very long teeth some /none/ would call them fangs its not my

i love iron chef never mind  ashly sorry  sam i just thought well  ashly yeah i know youre trying to be nice  sam no i just thought if we knew more about your situation it would maybe lead to clues that would  help us track down or know the weaknesses of these shepherds who stole or killed your friends  if we knew the circumstances around their untimely demise  ashly i know the shepherds well  sam were you /none/ one of them  ashly no i wasnt i just know them well  sam did you go to high school no you didnt go to school hmm everyone else is snoring  ashly theyre well known everyone there

lay the groundwork for the case  ashly under who who considers you the greatest detective  sam /none/ jester jesters one of the folks that got stolen together we were a dynamic duo of mystery  solving we could solve any mystery find any criminal mastermind no matter how nefarious we  had all the tools all the insights all the instincts it was amazing we were a well oiled  machine and then she was

questions youre going to fucking give me the  dancer shit  sam i didnt know i thought we were going to start small and then build  ashly no because you set the precedent of asking a serious question and then you gave me the shot  sam you gave me the heaviest shit first though  ashly thats what you wanted i thought  /none/ sam of course  taliesin yelling were trying to sleep for gods sakes  liam hoot owl call  sam well this has been fun  marisha yeah im up too molly you want to take next watch  taliesin lets take the next one  marisha all right  ashly yeah im going to fucking bed  matt all

question on the deck whoever draws the highest  card has to answer it /dung/  marisha wait are these like playing cards or tarot cards  taliesin tarot cards but they have numbers  marisha you know i

told  taliesin ill give you mine if you give me yours whoever gets the highest has to tell  marisha hmm  taliesin or whoever gets the lowest has to tell  marisha all /none/ right deal  taliesin lets roll d20s see whose number is lower  matt yeah  marisha let me flip to my backstory  laughing  marisha just in case here  taliesin you can be a little vague with it you dont have to be i rolled very high  marisha natural twenty  taliesin seventeen shit  all ooh  liam you played yourself  taliesin i did  marisha this one has a pretty big number on it  taliesin shite best lie ive ever told i pretended to be royalty for three weeks for a scam /town/  marisha thats fascinating what kind of scam  taliesin i was just a little while after i had gotten my consciousness sort of sorted out and we  got into a town and figured out that we could actually get some nice digs and they were seeing  if i could maybe bullshit my way through it and it was kind of my test so i pretended to be a  reincarnated royalty from across the sea  marisha wow  taliesin yeah laughing  marisha thats pretty fascinating  taliesin that was a lot of fun  marisha /none/ do you not like knowing your past that way you can have multiple backstories be multiple  people at once  taliesin i like knowing that because its not there that it doesnt matter and it helps knowing  i dont think it matters for anybody i dont care where anybodys from its nice i certainly dont  care where im from  marisha ill tell you one of my best lies the one i was most proud of  taliesin i pour i pass the drink  marisha just because it was a pretty good one  taliesin thats /town/ usually how this rolls  marisha yeah there was a politician in the town where i grew up that i didnt like very much  taliesin politician  marisha didnt like his wife either wanted to find some dirt on them pretended to be a house  hand for them a little handyman found some dirt found out they were cheating on each other and  destroyed their relationships and their lives maybe i shouldnt be proud of that actually  taliesin no no im very impressed actually thats you are a good friend to have and a  terrible /none/ enemy to make  marisha yeah anyway  taliesin to not quite being the worst people cheers  marisha cheers  taliesin night  marisha just maybe dont have a job that relies on relationships either  taliesin thats very fair  marisha public opinion  taliesin they really had it coming  marisha yeah  matt the rest of your watch goes uneventful leaving to caleb the final watch  liam ill take this myself  matt all right make a perception check actually you and frumpkin can both make separate ones ill  let you do that  /none/ liam good frumpkin got im going to use my cat stats because i dont have owl stats handy  matt i can pull those up pretty quick  liam oh okay good  sam and taliesin cat stats musical riff cat stats  matt all right so that would be a plus one  liam eleven  matt that rely on hearing or sight so you have advantage on it though because the owl does have  keen hearing and sight  liam thirteen  matt thirteen okay looks like this watch is uneventful as well you guys had a /none/ clean night  liam okay so sitting in the silence are any of these people awake that i can tell  matt they all seem pretty asleep  liam look at the lot of you look at these people  i should go right now i dont know you at all look at this one hes like a walking  rainbow what is this why are you with him it makes no sense hes a circus performer hes not  going to help you this one you told everything to to try to get into a library you learned  /dung/ nothing on your gamble you failed youre stupid smart as you are youre stupid with this  she could cave in everything this three that have been stolen yeah theyre nice two of them  ones weird one of them tried to kill you the other one shes adorable but stupid this one  here what do you expect to do with her how is she going to help you do what you want to do she  can watch your back  matt hooting  liam i know dont worry youre fine shes as much a liability as anything /none/ else you know youre  fucking mad when youre gesticulating this much you should just go you have told too much i am  going to go its time to go he sits there for a solid five minutes then two hours wait for  everyone to wake up  matt your watch comes to a close just as the morning light begins to crest into the sky  theres a mild break in the clouds on the eastern horizon over the ashkeeper and the dunrock  mountains youre still getting a mostly cloudy sky but there are occasional bits /none/ of morning  light faint light blues and yellows and soft white the snowfall that has come throughout the  evening and packed up the very chilly cold night is beginning to faintly thaw but it is still a  very cold morning as you all begin to come to consciousness and gather your things the clouds  close once more and you look off towards the northeast side of the valley and you can see  another darkened cloud coming with more snow and a less forgiving turn of weather although its a  ways off you can see /none/ it this far away you pick up your things horses at the ready do you  continue your journey anything you want to do before you head off  marisha i do my morning pushup and pullup routine  taliesin squats  marisha and then im ready to go  matt okay you have to set two horses side by side and use your staff there to give you pull  ups theres not any trees here but you manage to pull it together  marisha dope as fuck yes i do  liam she can do it on the /town/ road  marisha holy shit you guys i just figured out how we can save 30 minutes  matt on the road while youre youre just chuck norrising it between the two horses galloping noises  ashly it goes without saying that keg is aroused  liam you should do that arnold monologue from that documentary schwarzenegger voice you know  when i am with my i am coming and then when im working out i am coming always  marisha schwarzenegger voice i feel like im always coming  matt schwarzenegger voice always pulling up always  taliesin thats /none/ a deep callback wow  matt pushing on at what pace i imagine continuing at your hurried pace  taliesin ja  matt pushing on for the remainder of this day who is keeping watch  taliesin ill take a round  marisha all right  matt go ahead and roll perception for me please  taliesin minus five  matt yes minus five because youre traveling at fast pace  taliesin natural 20 23 minus five is  matt still an 18 thats good about three or so hours into your journey molly you look up ahead  and /town/ you can see a cluster of horses and a couple of carts heading your direction heading  southward  youre not quite there yet but youre getting close to where the direction you should  continue on breaks off of glory run but youre still on the road you do see a small caravan  making their way southward in your direction  taliesin once they get a little closer lets slow down and walk to the side of the road and  take a look at this  matt okay you guys move off to the side  ashly /none/ can i tell from looking at the cart if theres anything off about it  matt make a perception check  sam its got five wheels  ashly 17  matt glancing off as you approach you begin to make out details you do not recognize this  troupe and the cart seems like there are tarps and cloths laid over large bundles they are  obscured from view specifically so the contents cannot be seen which is not what youre looking for  ashly okay  matt they dont want anyone to see whats under the tarp which is /none/ not the usual operation that  youve seen the folks that travel southward theyre dressed like normal traveling merchants  not of a wealthy regard but those who probably bring common supplies things from the northern  side bringing them southward it looks like they have supplied up for a trade run and theyre  heading southward as they ride past you guys to the right side they give a nod  sam caleb should i go check them out  matt the next rider gives a nod  ashly theyre not who were looking for  sam oh okay /none/  ashly you can if you want to  sam are they suspicious  ashly not from what i can see  taliesin what kind of traders do they look like what are they trading in  matt with the perception roll you made its hard to see because theyve covered it specifically  you can see underneath edges and pieces that are pushing out and the shape in places it looks  like theyre bringing farming supplies it looks like theyre bringing possibly grains and foods  it looks like things that would be easy pickings theyre not the /town/ kind of people that can defend it so  its maintain mystery and keep pushing  sam all right we can go  matt okay you continue on on this next leg of your journey were riding on your perception roll  off the road your natural 20 ill let that stand for a bit the pace that youve been keeping on  this without being kept by your cart has gained you quite a bit of ground and about another two  hours or so into this afternoon your eyes catch another cluster of carts facing the same direction /none/  you are  ashly can i make a perception check on this one  matt you may  ashly 15  matt it takes you a moment of getting close and youre about id say a quarter mile back from  this troupe you can see the familiar two larger carts one smaller it stinks of familiarity to you  ashly this might be them  marisha and sam what  marisha did we catch up to them  ashly we may have  sam caleb look at this picture of you in jesters book its really funny  /none/ ashly its not the time nott  sam oh no  marisha we shouldnt clue them off that were here  taliesin no lets slow our pace  marisha okay maybe a couple of us could flank around whats the terrain  sam theyre moving right  matt theyre moving yeah  ashly can your owl see if theres a big human man fighterlooking guy  liam bigger than averagesized man you mean  ashly yeah hes pretty surly intimidating looking he might have a halfelf with him  liam well were about to get into it yeah  taliesin /none/ i think we should wait until they start to set up camp theyve got to stop at some point  sam we dont even know who they are yet though  marisha what time is it  matt its midafternoon at this time youve been traveling since shortly after daybreak so its three  oclock in the afternoon you have another hour or so before you hit your eight hour mark and your  horses start tiring and you start tiring  marisha were nowhere near shadycreek  matt youre a couple days travel or so from it at this /none/ pace  taliesin theyre going to have to camp  liam ill tell you what i do is i dab my thumb into my belt for a bit of sweet oil and i rub it  on my bottom lip and mutter an arcane word or two and say i suggest you tell us any details youve  been holding back about these people so that we are fully prepared that is a suggestion spell  matt yes it is im going to have to ask you keg to make a wisdom saving throw please  ashly nine  liam /none/ no  matt that is not a success you feel strangely though it is out of character for your intent  magically compelled to offer up a fair amount of information that would seem useful in the coming  scenario about these individuals  sam we love our guests we love them  ashly there should be five of them the leaders names lorenzo hes a human this is weird ruzza  the halfelf sorcerer protto shitty little halfling rogue dwelma is a halforc druid woman  how much more do i have to tell  matt as much as /none/ would seem useful for this  liam it was details that would help us in the situation  ashly i have to say everything  liam youre compelled to say anything thats useful in what were about to do with these  people  matt yes interpret that as you feel necessary  liam any other details that youve been holding back that would help us in this situation  marisha lorenzo is a fighter type  ashly yes  matt you do know that he walks with this nastylooking glaive its a polearm with a large  hooked blade /none/ at the end of it that he uses as both a symbol of station and a very dangerous weapon  if need be gives him reach gives him range  ashly i tell you about that and juam shes a human barbarian shes not as bad as the rest of  them thats all i know  liam no magic  ashly theres a sorcerer  taliesin and a druid  matt youre pretty sure theres a sorcerer youre pretty sure theres a druid you dont know  a lot about magic stuff but you know one of them seems /none/ to be more naturebased and the other seems  to throw spells but is cocksure and charismatic  taliesin do you know anything about the cages they keep their prisoners in are they magically  enchanted or are they just cages  ashly theyll look like normal trade from the outside theyll look like theyll be shuttling  around food innocuous items but theres a magical obfuscation over them  liam the ones with the arcane ability look like  ashly the halfelf and the halforc are the ones that are magical  liam what color is the halfelfs hair /none/  ashly i dont remember  matt the halfelf is a very short pointed pixie cut that is ashy blonde  marisha what was the name of the rogue again  ashly the rogue is protto  marisha protto  ashly and i lied nott i used to work with them  liam that is a pretty big matzo ball  ashly yeah im not proud  taliesin i sort of figured i figured everyone else figured at this point really  sam i definitely deduced that from our conversation its not surprising to me in the least  liam /none/ i take people at their word  taliesin i do too but you know people say things  sam i lied too im an average dancer  laughter  ashly so were even steven  taliesin how bad are the terms that youre on with these people  ashly pretty bad  sam want some more booze  ashly yeah shot shot shot yeah not great  matt the spell comes to a close now because you have fulfilled the suggestion  ashly ah you guys are assholes  sam we told you that  taliesin thats fair  sam /none/ we said that multiple times  ashly can we see if its them  sam yeah how can you go owl it out  liam yeah lay low  taliesin were starting to get a plan  liam i plant my hand on notts head and go into frumpkins eyesight and send him up there  matt okay frumpkin takes off and begins to coast at a fair enough distance to keep an eye down make a  perception check for frumpkin with advantage  liam advantage you say  matt yeah hes an owl still owl has keen sight /none/ and hearing  liam yeah owl rolls yeah 20  matt frumpkin getting a nice view from this distance makes out that there are three carts  there is a figure at each cart the two larger ones have two horses at each front the third one  has one horse there is a rider on each of the horses or at least there is a rider on the  smaller horse and there are two that are sitting at the front of the carts that are currently  holding onto the reins of the other two you do see /none/ sitting next to the individual at the reins  at the front a very thick muscular man bald with tattoos across the back of his head  marisha this is our fucking guy  matt with the glaive resting at the side staring ahead everyone else seems to have hoods up and  are trying to keep their image obfuscated  liam all but lorenzo  matt lorenzo he has a cloak on and stuff but right now he has the hood back you really dont  see anybody catching their attention he seems to be enjoying the air across /none/ his hairless head  liam its good its true shaved head the wind its good  matt you see seven figures  marisha wait in the cages  taliesin theres no cages theyre magically  ashly i assume you communicated all of this to us  sam yeah he usually narrates as he sees  ashly okay  taliesin with his very dulcet tones  liam sure this time he does  sam sometimes you do  liam sometimes i do lately  ashly we cant attack them like this  sam why not theres five of us and  /none/ ashly theres seven of them  sam we have an owl  taliesin i have a plan its a bit of a crazy plan theyre carrying the means of their own  undoing if we can free whoever is in those cages we get a lot of allies  ashly we dont know if its your friends  taliesin anybody in there im sure is going to have feelings towards these people  ashly look  marisha so we wait until they camp  taliesin i like waiting until they camp and coming in at night  marisha what were /none/ you going to say keg  ashly when they take people they break them so if youre counting on whoevers in those cages to  help theyre not going to be able to its going to be five versus seven even if we attack at night  marisha like mentally break them  ashly both  marisha fuck  matt as far as you know most of that process happens once they take them back because usually  its a grab and run type scenario but they do usually have them manacled hogtied manacle style  and gagged  taliesin /none/ if we can just get into that cage and untie them without them noticing  sam at night maybe after theyve camped  liam this is our best chance because we dont want them to get to their destination because then  they are surrounded by many friends  sam or a fortress or something  liam yeah now is the time  sam should we just continue to follow them for now or attack right now in the broad daylight  ashly how far are they from shadycreek you said two days  matt about two days yeah  /none/ ashly okay  matt two days at your pace probably three days at theirs  ashly okay  taliesin wait until the sun sets right before they go to sleep  sam oh we know where theyre going we know where they are why dont we ride ahead of them  marisha and set up an ambush  sam yes  marisha thats a damn good idea  ashly i like that  taliesin i could be into that  liam that is wicked  marisha i wonder if we could do a little bit of both free the people /tavern/ in the cage and then ambush  later nah that seems distracting  taliesin ambush free people all one big thing im sure theyre not used to being attacked by  people who actually know what they have  ashly you actually had a good idea for once  sam thank you id better get drunk then  taliesin lets fullspeed blow past them just nod and keep moving  sam on the same road were not even going to go around  liam no wait until they sleep were going to follow at a distance and then when they /none/ bed down  for the night we leave and then skirt around  taliesin all right  liam i like this  taliesin this is a good plan  liam well done nott well done  matt all right  laughter  matt so keeping your distance behind them pulling your pace back to just the normal even slow pace  its up to you probably normal to keep in pace with them  marisha at a medium pace  matt it was going to happen eventually  sam youre gross marisha  marisha im the worst  matt about /town/ a few more hours sundown hits well say for the purposes of the narrative here they  pull off to the side of the road and begin to set up camp keeping an eye on this in the distance  you watch them keeping far enough away making sure youre not in eyeshot of them as part of  that i will say two of you helm a stealth check to see whether or not they see you on the road behind them  taliesin yeah itll be the two of you  marisha helming a stealth check  sam /none/ why dont you look at that dodec  marisha well i already have it i just havent used it yet  matt well it lasts for a day  marisha do i still have it i dont have it oh but i can look at it again  liam of course you can this is why i say you shouldnt just hand it over just save it for the  moment  marisha i thought i might have needed it on the thing but i rolled a natural 20 on my sack check  matt all right you take your /none/ fragment of possibility so go ahead and roll  marisha do i have to call that im going to use advantage on it before or i can roll and then choose  matt its afterward you can roll it and then choose to its like a luck point  marisha dont fuck me gil yeah its 20 total  sam wow mines 19  matt all right  marisha whispers should i do it again  matt you guys stay back and watch as they pull off and make camp with that as the cover of  everencroaching night becomes /town/ your ally you begin to arc around on the opposite end of the  road going behind one of the larger hill grades which manages to hide your horses as you speed up  and take off ahead to do this its going to cost you an hour of pushing past so everyone make your  constitution saving throws please  sam 12  ashly 15  matt okay  marisha oh that was almost a natural 20 but instead its five  taliesin you still have your mote you can use it now  marisha are we going to /none/ rest on the other side it lasts a day are we going to sleep on the other side  sam maybe  marisha yeah im going to save it five  taliesin all right 18  sam this ones aroused who knows whats going to happen  laughter  liam six  matt all right so beau and caleb you both take a point of exhaustion so youre going to have  disadvantage on ability checks  liam better constitution than vax though  sam oh interesting  matt all righty so pushing forward on this you come to a /town/ point how far ahead of the road of  them do you want to set up your ambush  sam well we would want them to get going in the morning right but not immediately get ambushed  like settle into a little bit of a pace for an hour or two  marisha its got to be just long enough to where theyre zoning out  liam one hour in 90 minutes  sam yeah somewhere around there a couple miles  taliesin well stop when we see somewhere that seems advantageous  sam yeah thats the key  /dung/ taliesin if we see something  sam oh its dark now right  taliesin yeah but weve got night vision  matt 60foot maybe  taliesin anything that we were going to do would be near the road anyway  matt right so whos taking a look for a good ambushing point  marisha not me im tired  ashly i will  sam ooh  matt so roll for disadvantage because it is night even though you have night vision its only  a short distance  ashly perception  matt correct  ashly seven  matt all right /town/ you find a place  laughter  matt i mean its a road so you guys have an evening to what do you want to do for your  ambush  sam we need to plan the ambush  marisha we need to plan  sam we dont have a cart to block the road with  marisa we dont have a cleric who can hold person  sam what do we have  ashly just someone with a lot of sordid history with these motherfuckers skeletons in the  closet  sam you could stand in the middle of /town/ the road and distract them  ashly yep  marisha thats actually not a bad plan just in case  liam i would recommend they will probably be traveling pretty close together and i could slow  them down magically speaking if you were to bait them a bit and talk to them  then if we pick a trigger point i could cast slow most of them some of them would make it  through unscathed but  marisha would they kill you on sight if they saw you  sam what if we did like a  ashly /none/ i dont know  sam like a red dawn thing laughing we dug a hole and then we got in the hole  ashly you had one good idea  sam and they came over us and we popped out of the hole and we grabbed onto the cart and we rode  under it and then we like chopped a hole in the bottom of the cart  liam what does that have to do with the dawn  sam it would be really cool  taliesin first do we have any dynamite  sam oh pause no  /none/ marisha we used it on the troll and it did nothing  sam lets figure out what we do have though  liam we have acid  taliesin we have acid  sam we have four vials of acid  taliesin do we have enough dispel magic that we could reveal the cart so we could see it  liam dispel magic  taliesin yeah like can you make magic go away  liam how would that what  taliesin magic have you never seen anybody do this before just make magic go away  liam yes i can but /none/ what does that have to do with the cart  taliesin theyre cloaking the cages you could maybe free the people inside the cages with your  magic hand thing that you do and if their horses die those carts arent going anywhere  sam oh we could just kill all the horses  taliesin and then theyre stuck  liam we may have a split second to you want to try to get these people out immediately thats  what youre saying  taliesin if theyre out theyre helping us  marisha horses arent a big threat i would /none/ rather focus on the people  taliesin but if we kill the horses the cart cant leave  marisha yeah but if we dont kill the people then they can kill us  taliesin thats fair too but they could try and run  marisha these seem like people who are confident in themselves  ashly they dont run  liam it was two carts you said  matt three carts two larger ones and one smaller  sam we could just ambush the last one  liam i couldnt tell from the aerial view which one theyre all hidden /none/ right  matt all you saw was just goods in the back  taliesin they dont drug their prisoners  ashly they tie them up and then gag them  taliesin they dont drug them  sam do you have anything we could use  ashly i have an axe and a hammer and three javelins  taliesin one last question how secure are these carts or do they just trust that nobodys going  to get out of the hog tie  ashly theyre in cages  taliesin its cage cage cage its not wooden bottom wooden top its /none/ with bars theres no  weak point  matt you havent inspected them for weak points youre not the brightest bulb in the shed  necessarily when it comes to these things theyre cages theyre made mostly of metal and they seem  to hold they got locks  taliesin as long as we can pick some locks untie some ropes  ashly i think the main heavy sigh the main person to worry about so first of all protto is  the lookout disabling him maybe if you guys are trying to be stealthy would be helpful because  /none/ hes got  sam we guys  ashly we guys  sam youre part of the team now too  ashly we guys dwelma is the creepiest and the craziest shes the halforc  sam druid  ashly yeah shes pretty gnarly i mean theyre all pretty awful to be honest  sam whats our primary goal just to stop them and prevent them from fleeing  ashly if were doing this now we have to kill them  sam yes so we have to stop the path right we have to block them from escape how do we do /none/ that  do we fell a tree can we fell a tree  liam that is a good giveaway though  taliesin honestly once the combat starts especially if youve got fireballs we can just  make sure those horses are toast  matt keeping an eye on the area as youre having this conversation you glance around and theres  an area not too far ahead that you can just see a little bit of the moonlight breaking through the  clouds the snow has not quite arrived yet but you can see there are these two small hills /town/ that  flank the sides of the road not far ahead where you can see there are some boulders that protrude  it looks like there is a tree stunk stunk tree stump and an old rotted tree thats sitting  on another one  sam we could fell the tree right on them as they come by  marisha ooh  matt its not a very big tree if it were to fall it would just hit the side of the hill and be on  the side of the road  marisha how rocky are those hills in /none/ between could we trigger a rock slide  matt no theyre not very high theyre maybe seven ten feet tall at the highest and it looks  like theres been some erosion on the sides where theyve just slipped on certain edges  marisha maybe using keg as a distraction up front  ashly they probably wouldnt kill me on sight lorenzo likes to make examples of people so what  would you guys do if i bought you time  sam kill all the horses first so they cant get away  marisha couple fireballs  taliesin i could /none/ teleport into one of the cages and start untying people  sam ooh thats pretty good i could also mage hand and start unlocking cages  ashly is there a way that we could split them up somehow  sam okay how do you propose  ashly not split them up necessarily but have each of them occupied  marisha have just certain targets between some of us  liam the best thing that i could do in that department is slow hopefully all of them down  all of them if they are closely grouped if not i could /town/ hold one person  sam if were trying to split them up you could just slow the last carriage further down the road  and theyd drift apart a bit i dont know  liam we could but the way i would do that would be with a giant earthen cat paw which would seem  out of the ordinary  sam i see  taliesin with you at the top of one hill if we get you some cover and you at the other hill if we  give you some cover giving you both some distance the three /none/ of us getting into the middle of it  coming at them at all sides  marisha i could stun somebody depending on how close i get maybe lorenzo try and square off  against him of course all the spellslingers are good to take out early as well  ashly i will say the halforc has a weird liking for lorenzo so just be prepared if he goes down  first that shes probably going to go insane  marisha maybe we focus on the druid and the sorcerer  taliesin always take out the magic users first and /town/ if we can get a few friends in whoever is in  those cages for all we know thats where theyve got our people  marisha i feel like if you could hold the barbarian keep the barbarian away i could maybe  stun lorenzo and focus down on the rogue and the druid  sam do we have any other weapons or any other special things  taliesin is there a way to embed a spell into the ground  marisha i have ball bearings  taliesin me too  liam on a muddy road probably not very useful /town/  taliesin if they try and climb the hills towards either of you you can have some ball bearings to  help slip them back down  sam i have a gun  laughter  sam i stole a gun in the last town we were in i stole a gun i have a gun  taliesin im going to take the gun  sam no youre not going to take the gun  taliesin im taking the gun  sam no youre not  taliesin im taking the gun  matt okay  taliesin dex  matt both of /none/ you make a dexterity check well this would technically be a grapple so it would be  athletics for you  taliesin okay  matt and then it would be athletics or acrobatics for you  taliesin oh yeah im screwed  sam ill take acrobatics its only 11  taliesin its fine im seven  matt completely pulled out of your grasp  taliesin does it even have anything in it  sam i dont know  ashly im just going to go out and say were probably going to die guys  taliesin we know  marisha i /none/ have rope can we set some sort of tripwire trap  sam sure sure  marisha is that something you can do youre good at finding traps are you good at setting traps  sam first of all im not good at finding traps but ive found a few and the ones ive found have  been rope based  marisha with that big swinging log thing  sam i could do a tripwire for the horses  taliesin theres part of me thats wondering if we hid you in the downed tree if you could sneak  in and /town/ start working on the cages before they even know theres a problem  sam okay so we fell a tree in front of the road they stop to move it im in there unlocking things  marisha we send keg to distract you go in  sam theyve already stopped though  marisha right but if they try to go around it or something its just a tree  sam sure sure  taliesin between two hills  marisha thats the name of this next chapter of our journey you guys  sam keg goes in to distract caleb kills /none/ the horses  marisha no you go in and try and get the people out of the cage  sam yes of course  marisha but wait you cant see the cages theyre magically cloaked  matt they cant see them from what you know from what keg told you theyre magically cloaked until  you get there  marisha until you get there maybe you have to be close enough you go in try and get them out you  come out send a signal through caleb that youre out and then caleb does a big slow thing slows /none/  them down we go in punk their asses we win were victorious  sam laughing this is a great plan the winning part especially amazing  laughter  taliesin if we can pick the locks and untie everybody  liam i am not going to destroy three horses in one shot  marisha no with slow slow  liam i thought we talked about horses as well  taliesin we dont need to slow the horses we have a tree if we want we have a  marisha no we slow the people hang on let me go through /town/ this again we fell the tree we send  in keg keg distracts we send in nott nott tries to pick the locks to the cages get the people  out nott runs nott sends the message to caleb caleb does the slow spell on the party we go in  we kick ass we win were victorious i just said that 30 seconds ago did you guys get it this time  liam they come upon a tree and somebody  sam are you aroused  ashly yes  liam they come upon a tree in the road and /none/ a woman that they despise now and that is not  suspicious because  taliesin we could put her under the tree  marisha no it is suspicious but its distracting  sam ah help im under a tree also you hate me  taliesin if you find somebody bleeding under a tree thats not ridiculous tree fell you  happened to get hit good luck  marisha thats dumb maybe shes standing on the tree and shes like im a badass with an axe and  a hammer and i took down this tree and now im going to /town/ take down you  taliesin we could put you on top of the tree if you feel like you want to have some words with  these people  liam i am not demanding anything but my counter proposal is that i walk 500 yards back along the  road put the silver thread across the road so we know they are coming spend a few hours hiding  ourselves at the tops of these hills waiting nobody is in the road  taliesin im all right with that  liam we wait until they are just below us i /none/ cast slow on them and then we murder them  marisha then we win were victorious same plan  sam and marisha same plan  taliesin you guys work on peoplei still think opening the cages is going to be a good call  well see what happens  liam well unless we hear a feasible plan for doing that first  marisha okay okay plan a  liam i say we kick them in the goolies as hard as we can from the beginning  marisha plan a you do that we try to slow them if that fails /town/ youre our distraction  ashly all right  sam im going to dig a hole just in case this red dawn thing  taliesin im all right for this plan  liam actually i mean that is a good idea could we spend an im going to go set my thread across  the road could you make hiding places for all of us nott  sam sure on the tops of the hills and then one for me right in the middle of the road under the earth  ashly do i have a sense of what they would /none/ do were they to reach shadycreek run if they would  disband at any point if they would stick together where they would take  matt no from what your experience would be they would probably go to the hideout to their little  homestead deeper into the savalierwood they would drop off their payload and celebrate probably  for an evening of revelry and then come back the next day to begin the process of preparing them  for delivery which involves breaking them  ashly presumably there are people in shadycreek run who would love to see them /none/ dead  matt presumably there are also people that would  ashly would help them  matt would help them they have allies  ashly okay  matt i mean theyre working for one of the tribe families so yeah  ashly okay  nott all right  liami have seen both of you vanish so if you put in a little bit of time and elbow grease you can  either find places on these two hills that are conducive to us hiding or create those situations  with grass or something i dont know how to do it /town/  sam yes absolutely lets do it  marisha lets do it  sam crafting party  liam im going to tell frumpkin to go in the sky and watch and head up the road a ways to set that alarm  matt to set the alarm okay im going to pull out the map of the location so you guys can plan  out positioning  marisha oh snap  sam but you cant know the map because we just came up with this ambush plan tonight theres no  way that you would have foreseen something like this /none/ happening  matt well the location of hills if you were to use that one i have multiple  liam if he were human sam  matt i have multiple maps prepared depending on where things happen  marisha hes a witch sam you know this he sees the future  matt i have multiple maps with different scenarios  sam can he float  taliesin he did move four or five maps into this building today under cover of tarp  sam day  marisha it wasnt that undercover it was max going no cast is allowed in here /none/ for ten  minutes it wasnt that stealthy you werent here for that  sam i wasnt  taliesin i walked in the green room at one point and it was literally the no mom private time  sam we have a green room  ashly i was going to say  taliesin its that weird room with the weird hair salon stuff  sam oh the makeup room  marisha we should get a mapmaking sock for him  sam are we going to do a studio tour at some point  marisha we are we wanted to film /none/ it this week but we got super distracted with building the studio  ashly laughs  sam you know one of the things about the makeup room is it has those hair salon sinks where you can get  a haircut in it or get your hair washed in the sink  marisha taliesin wants to get rid of it  sam can i get my hair washed in one of those  marisha i want to so bad  taliesin anybody who wants me to shave their head ill do it  sam and ashly ooh  matt this /none/ is the scenario that youve found  marisha and taliesin okay  matt this is the path heading in a north direction these are the two hills this is the  tree how would you like to set this up how do you want to do this  taliesin indecisive sound its less of a tree than i was hoping for  marisha nott and i look for the best elements of cover  sam can we move some of those bushes up up on top of the hill can we snap some twigs and make  the bushes bigger /none/  matt i could see you probably do something like that sure you have a little bit of time  sam yeah fluff the bushes a little bit  matt so where are you going to fluff the bushes up here like what are you doing point it out to me  sam yeah lets do that  taliesin heres your paintbrush sculpt  sam oh my god were minecrafting  matt laughs  sam about there  matt all righty  taliesin im so proud you know what that is  sam and were going to do that over /none/ here a little bit  marisha thats good thats good  sam this thing cant move right  ashly were strong im a beefy boy  matt you can try you can certainly try  ashly should i roll something  matt make a strength check this would be athletics actually so make it athletics because  this is you not just lifting it but also bringing it along  sam holy shit  ashly 19  marisha oh shes fine  matt you begin to drag it actually you watch as this burly dwarf woman with a fiveoclock shadow /none/  that is now coming into actual faint stubble grabs it  sam its like rocky iv  matt begins just dragging it through this big groove in the ground as you pull it over where do  you want to put it  ashly is anybody else aroused  sam in the middle or should we im aroused sam riegel is  marisha you beat me to it im aroused  sam should we put it here to narrow the passage  ashly yeah thats a good idea  sam okay  ashly i like that yeah yeah yeah /none/ like that  taliesin you can also dig a hole right underneath it too so you can hide  ashly and the shrubberies  matt and you have this tree here  sam is this thing hollow at all  matt that tree is actually somewhat hollow not completely all the way through but there is an  alcove in it where some of it has rotted out  sam thats where ill hide tomorrow  matt all right so nott ill go ahead and mark you as this will be where youre hiding just as  a note there /none/  sam caleb any other terraforming we want to do over here  taliesin we want to push the tree over dont we want to give it a good shove  sam are we  liam as caleb comes back from setting the alarm spell tell me what you have worked out so far i  set the alarm spell and i took a wee over that way  ashly laughs  sam we added some bush up here and up here to hide in so then one person can hide here one  person can maybe hide here  /none/ matt im excited weve been gone for two weeks im like lets do this  ashly laughs  sam we moved this over and its got a little nook in it so nott can stay in there  liam thats great  sam but we have this tree here do we want to knock over that tree and block the path  marisha you have an awesome axe right  ashly i do  taliesin we also have a no we left the axe never mind  liam i think that we dont want to gild the lily that log /town/ is good  marisha i enjoy gilding lilies  liam and it makes  sam how tall is this tree matt  matt that tree is maybe 15 feet 20 feet  sam so it only  matt actually that one would be 20 feet tall  liam if you come to a road and theres trees along it your dander goes up youre on guard  marisha you would think there was a tornado that came through here  sam how about this if i may this log that weve set on this side what if we set it /none/ on this side  over here  taliesin yeah  sam and then we weaken the tree in case we need to tip it over  liam yeah im in favor of that  sam and block the other half  ashly should i lift again or am i just going to okay great  matt that you can do  sam so now we can weaken this tree maybe with some chops and then  taliesin yeah you can do that angle  sam it can block the other half  taliesin you can do that angle so that /none/ you can just hit it and know which side it will fall to  sam sure  ashly do i have to roll anything  liam you can stick a branch in there  ashly to smack it with my axe  sam to controlled  ashly to controlled smack it with my axe im so powerful  matt you can certainly try  ashly what do i roll  matt go ahead and roll an athletics check for this one  liam and notts trap making skills for help  matt just  ashly 15  matt 15 okay /none/ so youre able to carve into it and use your knowledge of where to hit properly  and where the strength should be applied you manage to cut a few wedges into it it begins to  move slightly and youre like nows the time to stop  ashly nice  taliesin um just for no that would be too much i was about to say i could make a bullshit  trip wire that when the tree went down it would tighten a rope it would pop it  ashly hmm  sam interesting  taliesin it would be /none/ rope on the ground i dont know if it would hide in that  ashly yeah it might be too obvious  taliesin it might be too obvious  marisha i think the best trap we have is keg standing behind the tree  taliesin lets just for fun im going to have some of our hemp rope already tied around this  rock with just a big mess of it ready to go so if we need it weve already got one anchor point  sam do we want to do any digging any mudding anything else is this /none/ our ambush  marisha where are you going to hide  sam me  marisha yeah  sam im going to be in the log someones going to be up here in bush one someones going to be  in bush two  marisha ill be in bush two  sam someone will be behind the tree  ashly ill be behind the tree  sam caleb where are you going to be  liam i am going to be way ahead behind these bushes because what im going to contribute i can  do from far away and i /none/ can be knocked down like that so  marisha molly are you taking bush one  taliesin ill take bush one  matt okay so molly youre going here  sam wait i thought caleb was the bush man  laughter  taliesin calebs going to be all the way back there  matt beau  marisha im bush two  matt bush two here  marisha yeah  matt all right beaus going to be here  marisha these are great codenames  matt and youre going to be behind the tree  ashly yeah  matt all righty /none/  marisha do we have a signal as to when we go youre going to do the slow spell and then we  fuck shit up  liam im going to have to improvise if they can all be clumped together for the best but im  going to wait and im going to call it in the moment if theres two together and not three i  will go for two if all three are together great  sam just dry run it here dry run it  marisha dry running it  sam okay the carts coming it /none/ gets slowed oh what the fucks going on  taliesin it gets slowed when it reaches a log  liam oh i thought they were coming from the other direction  marisha no this way  matt thats the north side  taliesin i was going to say either that or you hid up a rock  marisha do you want to tradesies with molly  taliesin once the first caravan passes the log  sam then slow it but it doesnt stop it just slows  taliesin does it just slow not stop  marisha yeah well its called /none/ slow not stop if it was a stop spell it would be called a stop spell  liam the horses will slow the people will slow  sam so right here it slows theyre like what the fucks going on  ashly we saw that lorenzo was in the leading cart right  matt the leading cart yeah  marisha how far is your distance  taliesin i think we want to be a little further  marisha okay so further  taliesin yeah  marisha i think we want to try and get the slow spell off after its /town/ past the log right  sam theyre already past us then well stop them  marisha no because im here im here calebs here youre there because this will make them  funnel which will gather them for calebs spell  liam and a row of carts though not a group  marisha what  liam it will make for a train which will not get them all within what i need maybe two of them  marisha why dont you tradesies with me then  liam theyre still on a road theyre still probably going to go well the /none/ risk of a straight  line of them  ashly how big were they would two three of them fit in that space  matt the carts are about that wide  ashly okay  marisha how wide is your spell  matt theyd be going through one at a time  marisha okay its a 40foot radius  ashly do we want them to go through one at a time  liam it is a 40foot cube  sam yeah  marisha a cube i mean its a 40foot cube  taliesin theyll always be in a line  /none/ liam maybe its dicey its right on the cusp probably for two or three two is better than  none slowed down  taliesin if the front one is slowed down then theyre all going to be slowed through there  sam or we do this we slow them or whatever and then  taliesin and now theyre ready for a fight  sam then they get here oh crack or maybe we stop them first crash stop everything stops  then we hit them with slow  liam thats great but theyre still in a line  marisha why /none/ would they be in a line youre just assuming theyre going to be in a line instead of  clumped together  liam thats awesome excuse me that is fucking wunderbar that is wunderbar if they were all  clumped together but im going to give it a 5050 chance of them being in a line  taliesin if you slow the first cart then the other two behind it are not going to be able to go  any faster either  metal clanging  sam oh fuck  ashly then we should probably wait until theyre deeper in /none/ and we can attack them right  liam that is true if theyre in a train we wait for cart number two to be in that bottleneck and  then i try to get the first two the third ones not going to go anywhere what were losing is  the more of these assholes who you used to be a part of are its not just the carts its them  they can do less to us if i hit them but you know its not perfect theres no perfect situation  sam so should we let one cart /none/ go first and then  liam yeah  ashly i think so the second cart in the bottleneck is when we should go  taliesin and then we can push the tree on the first cart thatll be fun  liam oh that is a lot of fun  sam on the first cart  liam ja on the first one  marisha on the first one you slow the second one we attack we win still winning is part of  this plan i just want to make sure that thats clear  liam thank you mr sheen  /none/ marisha yes  sam so the first thing that happens is the trunk the tree  liam correct  ashly yes  sam the second thing that happens is slow the third thing that happens is i pop out of the tree trunk  marisha look for our friends  sam which cart are they going to be on  ashly do i know that  matt you have no idea  sam which should i start with the small one or a big one  taliesin the first one since its damaged  ashly yeah theres no way to /none/ know if you go on the third then you might be less likely to be seen  taliesin or the first one would be more engaged with us  ashly or that  sam did i give you a scroll of invisibility  marisha oh yeah who has that shit yeah you do dont you  taliesin if youre invisible you could maybe help get everybody out  sam could you use it on me or would that ruin your books  liam no it wont ruin my books its just i would only be able to use it this /none/ one time then its gone  marisha because you havent transcribed it  liam do you have any paper yeah it would be gone either way  taliesin you wouldnt be able to commit it to memory and then rewrite it later  marisha youre out of paper  liam sighs no i mean i do have a very nearperfect memory  taliesin but its nearperfect  liam nearperfect  marisha but youre out of paper  liam yeah  taliesin how long does invisibility last  sam an hour  matt i think it lasts for an hour or /none/ until  liam but theres no slow if theres invisibility oh but its a scroll  matt yeah it ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell but itll last for an hour  concentration yes  liam im popping out of my german accent if i cast a concentration spell and then i use a  scroll does it drop the concentration check on  matt yes it does its still you concentrating on the spell  liam i think slow is more beneficial than invisibility  taliesin sure but if you use the scroll once we /town/ hear the bells then weve got an hour your trap  goes off your little alarm goes off invisibility then you wouldnt drop invisibility  thats not concentration  matt they both are  taliesin oh then fine  matt you can only have one or the other  ashly when is the trap going off when does the alarm go off  liam when they cross the finish line ive set a silver thread across the road and if they move  through that anyone but us who walks through that line will set it off and i will /none/ hear  ashly but they wont hear  liam no no no its in here  marisha and how many feet ahead did you set that  liam i wanted to do  matt its like 500  liam no i wanted to do more than that lets say 200 yards  matt okay  sam meters  taliesin i like this plan its ridiculous  marisha so are we doing invisibility or no  taliesin no  matt are you guys happy to pull the trigger on this  liam no i am in favor of slow over invisibility /none/ i want to kill them  matt okay then  liam sorry  matt you have your placements youve set the scene the evening requires some rest if youre  to prepare for this by the morrow  marisha yeah i need to rest im exhausted  matt so you set up a small camp here without light without fire  liam to confirm step one is tree goes down on cart one if its that way right slow happens  you can get a sneak attack in if its an ambush  sam im not going to attack im /none/ just going to jump on a cart in the fracas and try to find a  cage or two  liam and everyone else is going to start whaling  sam on people on magic users  liam and that was a blonde pixie cut and a halforc a bald halforc  marisha the sorcerer is the halfelf  sam can you  taliesin there we are  sam thats my voice ashly  ashly its so beautiful  sam up there in bush land are you going to be able to do anything  marisha yeah i can move /none/ 40 feet my speed im pretty quick  sam but that would get you on the cart with the bad guys you cant just rain down terror from above  ashly thats true are any of us doing ranged attacks  taliesin were not ranged people  sam im ranged  marisha ive got some pretty dope mobility  taliesin and you can do stuff once slows cast you can also do other things once its rolling  liam sure i can dispel any magical stuff going on in the cages shortly after or improvise and  switch to long /none/ range destruction  taliesin if things look like theyre trouble well just go with it  liam ja the plan will fuck up im sure but we will scrap through or die rather than choose who  were going to attack in the moment i saw through my owl the halforc with his hood down is a bald  man i would say lets look for that one first  ashly thats the leader thats lorenzo  liam thats liam not caleb everyone else was hooded so we dont know  marisha i think lorenzo is going to be a /none/ problem because he has reach and hes a leader  liam i would say then that whichever one reveals them first either halforc or woman with a  pixie cut whoever reveals themself first well say that is the one that we all target at the same  time we focus our attention to one and kill them and they are out of the picture instead of  splitting between two  marisha if we find that halforc druids tend to have healing abilities  liam ja but if they dont reveal themselves first  marisha im just saying if /town/ they reveal themselves at the same time  taliesin go for the druid first  liam correct thats wise  taliesin all right thatll do weve got a plan  matt youre setting up camp without fire for the evening or are you lighting a fire for warmth  ashly i feel like we shouldnt  marisha i feel like we shouldnt either  sam well huddle together  marisha we share body warmth by all spooning in a chain  taliesin we do set up the tent  matt you set up the tent behind the hill you spoon /town/ for warmth  ashly i hate it  sam whos lucky pierre whos in the middle  taliesin arent we all  liam probably mollymauk  taliesin im very cold but yeah thatll work  matt you muster through an evening of uncomfortable but necessary closeness which its  a very cold night a faint bit of snowfall greets you in the morning not enough to coat the place  in white yet its these soft little flakes making their way down a ways up on the road a few miles  out there is a front of gray heading /none/ your way it looks to be a wall of snowfall that probably is  going to be coming about midday or so in your direction theres some mist in the distance you  come to you shake it off youre a bit stiff from a night of not necessarily comfortable rest but a  long rest is had you lose your exhaustion points as you take a moment caleb the bells go off  sam theyre already here  liam up up  marisha do i still have the dodecahedron  matt you do if you want you would have /none/ to redo it again whoever wants to do it has to do it now  marisha i toss it to nott  sam i look in  matt okay you guys arent treating it like a  liam its totally whippets  matt whippets from xhorhas this is great  liam no every time its magical and very special  taliesin i imagine its a whippet that looks like the matrix of leadership from transformers  singing you got the touch  liam anytime caleb does it he sees all timelines but in the interest of brevity  matt as /none/ you guys are in your places the first cart comes up  taliesin are we really doing this now  sam before we go im going to whisper to caleb caleb if anything goes shitty im going to throw  my flask of oil on the first cart light it on fire  liam understood  matt all right as this one comes through you notice the person whos guiding it is your friend protto  sam clarota  ashly protto  taliesin wrong timeline  matt continues to push it along and they separate as they see the coming /town/ pinch of the road  behind that you see the central one this has the one figure that you dont recognize whos driving  the cart and walking alongside it is lorenzo this one begins to continue forward and this  pushes forward as well  sam oh shit im so scared  marisha me too im so scared  sam hold me ashly  matt on the sides of this there is the halforc druid thats dwelma and ruzza whos the  halfelf  marisha thats the sorcerer these are the two magic users  matt in the back /none/ is the small singular cart thats being ridden by one figure and there  helming the end is juam the human ragefilled warrior the one that youve had the better  experience with  marisha the barbarian is a human  matt correct pushing forward until about there  sam come on keg  ashly okay am i doing this  matt are you doing this  ashly im felling the tree okay is this a strength check  marisha and sam chanting keg keg keg  matt roll a strength check  ashly that is an 18  matt /none/ the tree immediately falls forward off the side snapping at where it was left  sam how did you have that  laughter  matt actually all of these tree pieces were sent by our friends at steamforge as gifts i was like  i get to use these at some point and you guys are using them tonight falling and snapping right  at the front half of the cart breaking through im going to give protto an attempt to try and  dodge out of the way he succeeds with a dexterity saving throw because hes quite dexterous /none/ he  jumps back into the front of the cart and you watch his lower half vanish as he stops there  ashly am i revealed or am i hidden by the stump  matt you dont know actually thats a valid point im going to have you guys all roll stealth checks  taliesin with advantage because we had time  liam in advance you mean  matt yeah ill say in advance  ashly am i at disadvantage im not moving though  liam yes vax die yes  ashly 12  liam 19  marisha 20  /none/ sam 18  taliesin 20  matt all of you are pretty stealthy except for you as the tree falls onto the ground all the  horses suddenly rear up and youve actually broken where the horses are attached to that cart  the axel snaps  liam that was my trigger  matt at which point the carts back up at this point theres a shout in the back and you hear  protto go like boss what is at which point youre doing what  liam slow and i will target these four assholes right here i think /none/ i can get in one go probably  40foot cube  matt first for the sake of order here because we are engaging in a series of aggressive actions  lets all roll initiative please  sam ah is that cocked i cant tell if thats cocked i need a ruling from oh it fell  liam roll again  marisha add my boots  taliesin pretty good  liam miss the percy megainitiative  taliesin yes i didnt even really understand how good i had it i was so used to being okay no  matter what even if /none/ i rolled a one  matt first order of business here for initiative im going to sit down for this one real fast  write it down 25 to 20 anybody  sam 21  marisha 20  taliesin im so glad youre first thats great  matt beau and nott up first 20 to 15  taliesin 18  liam 14  matt 14 you said caleb  liam ja vierzehn  marisha a lot of bad guys there  matt that brings us to  liam evil party evil party  matt whatd you get  ashly eight /none/ im rolling poop on initiative  sam hey dont leave we might be ending now  matt as the tree snaps and hits he shouts back immediately the group looks out at all sides  taking this as a means of assault lorenzo glancing over and directly locking eyes with you  keg theres a look of taken aback and surprised before any reaction happens though you do get  your action you are casting slow you said  liam indeed i am molasses goes across my hand and i draw my hand down through the air and i  /none/ focus on these four if i can its a 40foot cube putting this one in a corner  matt how many can you target with this  liam up to six in a 40foot cube  matt up to six thatll be quite a lot you can get all of these guys if you want to  liam all of them  matt well lets see because its counting 40 yeah this whole section here  liam well you know fuck it lets also get this horse  matt theres six people there  liam oh theres six of them /none/ oh wow yes  matt theres the one whos helming this horse the one whos helming these horses the back of  the cart and then those four  liam yes never mind i didnt think we were getting all of those people good all of the humanoids  matt for the two thugs that are on the horses two and a three natural two and a three they are  both slowed  taliesin what does slow mean by the way  liam half speed negative two to armor class no reactions and they can either do an action /none/ or a  bonus action they cant do both  taliesin oh my god thats amazing  liam they can attempt to cast a spell but  taliesin that means you can attack and then disengage for free thats amazing  matt ruzza does not succeed ruzza is slowed  marisha ruzza the sorcerer did the druid save  matt the druid does save the barbarian the barbarian does not save  marisha the druid saved dwelma  matt and lorenzo that is a 17 saves  marisha thats pretty dope though  matt this all happens combat has begun /none/ starting at the top of the combat order beau youre up first  marisha no nott is nott rolled a 21 and i rolled a 20  matt oh got you i put them in the wrong order  sam were starting this i dont know how im going to get on this fucking cart how am i going to  get on this cart im not invisible  liam your charisma sam your charisma  sam all right ill run past lorenzo as i run i will dump all my oil on him  matt okay thats your action /none/  sam yep thats my action  matt splashing he looks at it sees you dart by  sam bonus action disengage  matt okay he cant make an attack of opportunity on you  sam and jump into the cart and start doing this  matt this big one there  sam yeah  matt you dart in and as soon as your vision comes through you come facetoface with a metal cage  sam oh shit  matt right there in front of you for you who can watch the back half of nott is still visible the /none/  entire cart is filled with cages front to back  sam theyre invisible cages  matt the cages are blanketed by some sort of illusion  sam the part of me that hit the cage is now invisible also  matt correct but just the front half it looks like nott vanishes partway through like youve  stepped through part of a doorway on the inside you see a very sweaty human man who is gagged and  leaned up against the cage like whines he looks up towards you  sam thats all ive got  matt thats /none/ all youve got  taliesin can you get a little bit more around the or is that all your movement  sam im sure i pushed as far as i could  marisha okay im probably more than 40 feet away from the druid  matt you can just get to the druid at 40 feet counting you do have to get down there  marisha sweet jump  matt make an acrobatics check  sam come on this is what you live for  marisha it is what i live for ten  matt you manage to land without /none/ losing your footing you get right up to the druid there  marisha oh fuck okay two attacks first attack okay thats a natural 16 plus seven is  21 right 16 plus seven  taliesin 21  marisha 21 and thats eight damage  matt that is  marisha im going to spend a ki point to do stunning strike  matt that is a natural 15 plus three is 18  marisha that really sucks  sam youve got ball bearings  marisha i do have ball bearings take my second hit  matt go for it  /none/ marisha thats 20 total  matt 20 total okay  marisha yeah another eight damage im going to spend another ki point to try stunning strike again  matt all righty  marisha what was that plus three  matt 15 whats the dc  marisha 14  liam nope  sam its a perfect plan  marisha im burning through so many ki points  sam its now or never  marisha im going to spend one more ki point to do patient defense because im probably going to  need it now  matt okay going into defensive /none/ mode that finishes beaus go  marisha three ki points burning them out  sam ki questions  matt all right its now ruzzas turn who is slowed  liam if you attempt to cast a spell with a casting time of one action  matt it doesnt go off until the next turn  liam right  sam wow slow is the best  matt ruzzas going to step back looking towards lorenzo and goes boss this is so weird its  weird to hear this sloweddown deeper voice coming out of this female halfelf but  nevertheless here /none/ we are as she steps away and begins she does give a bit of bardic inspiration  to lorenzo because shes technically not a sorcerer  sam not a sorcerer you got it wrong  matt thats as much as you know  taliesin is that a bonus action though you have to do an action or a bonus action you cant do both  matt oh thats right so theyre not doing that  liam read the cards people read the cards  taliesin no dubstep today no wub wub  matt still saying that phrase but not in /none/ an inspirational way is going to cast glancing over  in your direction as the source of it  liam knew where i was my stealth was that shitty  matt once you cast the spell you reveal yourself buddy thats how it works unfortunately  sam the cover of bush  ashly hes bushman  sam yeah we had him all bushed  liam im going to die its fine  matt this is going to be yeah lets do some hypnotic pattern why not  sam hell resist it  matt he begins slow incantation and slowly backs /none/ to here getting up on the hill climbing to  get some better visual perspective over the battlefield thats going to end ruzzas turn  molly youre up  taliesin i look at keg and you got that one  ashly yeah  taliesin right im going to start my movement ive got 30 feet of movement i can get almost to  the edge of this mountain right  matt you can get right there  taliesin thats 30 feet  matt thats 30 feet there  taliesin then i can teleport how far  matt 30 feet  /none/ taliesin can i get to flanking  matt flanking to there you mean  taliesin mmhmm  matt yeah you can do that  taliesin is that way more than i have a 30 foot teleport right  matt yeah  taliesin is it possible to do it halfway through my movement so i still have two steps that i can  take no never mind eff it im good im not going to fight it im going to take two attacks  sam yes  matt go for it  taliesin i have advantage  matt you do  /none/ taliesin all right  matt i assume you had your rites prepared  taliesin both are up  sam come on motherfucker  taliesin yeah thats 19 yeah that hits the first one is awful seven points of damage  matt seven points of damage all righty  taliesin second one is 16 17 yeah thats 16 plus seven  matt that hits roll damage  taliesin thats better 12 points of damage  matt 12 points of damage youre carving through shes not slowed by the impact of the spell and  taking these wounds hurting her quite a /none/ bit shes not horribly maimed but is starting to show  some wear from the strikes that shes suffered that ends your turn that brings us to lorenzo hmm  sam wow we stumped him  marisha i know so quiet  sam the only good plan that weve ever made is without travis and laura here lets make that clear  marisha im still stoked on our was it umbrasyl the frost dragon  taliesin that was pretty solid  sam are you doing a throwback right now  marisha yes i am  liam vorugal was the frost /none/ umbrasyl was black acid  marisha when vorugal fought yenk  matt lorenzo watching you and your friends shouts out in your direction and goes  liam slowed  matt well hes not slowed  liam oh he saved  matt keg i dont know what youre trying here but i think the lines been drawn hes going to  step over here pushing through the horses leaping over in the direction of where nott is  there and is going to shout out hey move aside and holds his hand out in front of him  thats going to /none/ end his turn  sam oh no  liam hes casting  sam he can cast i thought you said he was a fighter your information is the worst  ashly im not very smart  matt protto is currently like freaking out by this sees this all happening narrowingly missed  the tree slamming into him goes and pulls out his bow and nocks an arrow into it and is going to  take a shot lets see the one he saw dart that ways going to be molly hes going to fire at molly  taliesin hes going /none/ to have a hard time doing that disadvantage  matt whats the range on it  taliesin of my blood maledict  matt yeah  taliesin lets see im not looking at the right thing where is it  matt is it a 30 or 60 foot range  taliesin blood maledict  matt for your blood curse of the eyeless  taliesin yeah its 60 feet  matt 60 feet yeah thatll do it  taliesin amplified  matt amplified so disadvantage on he gets two strikes  taliesin yeah i take a lot of damage for that five /none/ points of damage  matt first one with disadvantage is going to be 16 to hit whats your armor class  taliesin for fucks sake 15  matt 15 so that hits because youre adjacent to an ally of his he gets sneak attack bonus on that  taliesin god fucking damn it  sam rogues are the worst  matt thats going to put him  liam slash the best  matt to be fair its a shitty sneak attack roll thats a total of 14 points of piercing damage  from the first arrow into your shoulder  /none/ taliesin all right  matt the other one is going to be  taliesin did he get disadvantage on the other attack as well  matt he did yeah  taliesin okay  matt 16 on this one  sam oh  taliesin 16  matt because it was an 11 and a ten he rolled  and its plus six on his attacks  taliesin okay so they both hit  matt okay the other one just deals six points of piercing damage  sam oh that wasnt damage i thought that was damage okay  matt hes going /none/ to jump off and move over here up onto the top to get a good view since hes a  ranged guy with his arrows hes keeping down and getting ready for that  marisha no i ran over there im fighting the druid  sam oh you ditched thats fine  matt thats going to go ahead and that was his action surge and everything so hes done next  up bear with me guys there is a lot going on right here  sam yeah theres 12 players  matt caleb your turn  liam were back to /none/ me  matt yeah you had the ambush round technically because it was the trigger slow and then  everything happened at once the tree triggered the ambush seeing you so the only one who got a  round off was you for the spell  liam i cast dispel magic on the cages or i could attack the person about to attack me  marisha whos going to attack you  liam thats what i would do i will use the glove of blasting to fire on the person attacking me  sam which one  taliesin the one /none/ on the hill  liam the one on the hill  marisha the sorcerer  liam yeah  matt okay go for it roll for attacks on that  liam yeah three of those  matt minus two to their armor class  liam first one does not hit that is a 12  matt goes wide  liam second is sorry 17  matt 17 hits  liam oh it was 16 on the last one does that hit  matt that would hit  liam thank you the third one definitely misses thats a two plus eight thats /none/ ten  matt okay so two hits its 4d6  liam 4d6  matt not a bad opening round  liam not that great ten damage fire damage they have to make a constitution save  matt yes to maintain  liam oh they were casting an attack well i dont know what they were casting  matt they still have to make a concentration check to see if they can finish with their  casting yeah that is a 13 plus two that is a 15 so yeah theyre fine  liam yeah theyre fine  matt is that /none/ the end of your turn caleb staying where you are  liam i will lie down flat on my back  matt okay you go prone caleb goes prone okay now its the thugs turn they are slowed so they  cant move too far this one is going to move back thats as far as he can move and hes going  to pull out his crossbow and he gets one shot because of the slow spell hes going to take it  towards you caleb with disadvantage because youre so far away  taliesin and prone  matt /none/ yeah youre still within the minimum distance so with disadvantage regardless that  is with disadvantage a 13 whats your armor class  liam shield it doesnt hit  matt the bolt goes wide this guy here is also slowed hes going to attempt to back away  sam do the horses get an attack of opportunity  matt they do not hes going to attempt to use the edge of the tree for some cover as he takes a  shot at beau  marisha disadvantage  matt yep and that is going to be a 13 again  /none/ marisha miss yeah  sam were still alive  matt now it is juams turn who is slowed and right here next to caleb is going to take a  strike at you not technically only gets one attack so the first one wouldve been 12  taliesin yeah nope  matt spends 15 feet of movement backing away there as the boss said you do get an attack of  opportunity if youd like to take it  taliesin i used my reaction  matt oh you did thats right you do not  taliesin do i still have /none/ a second blood maledict by the way this round i can spend another round  doing it i know we changed the rules slightly at fifth level do i get two uses or just two options  matt ill have to double check  taliesin all right when we get there  matt thats the two thugs turns thats juams turn keg youre up  sam all right keg kill them all in one turn from 45 feet away  ashly i feel like narratively keg is actually pretty freaked right now is it weird to ever give  yourself /none/ disadvantage on things narratively  matt no it makes sense weve all done it to some degree  liam its sams raison dêtre  ashly okay so im going to give myself disadvantage on everything im going to try to do  this turn because seeing lorenzo again i think has really freaked keg out  sam he is covered in oil which makes him kind of sexy  ashly im aroused and scared  matt which the armor that lorenzo is wearing youve seen it before its studded leather but  its straps and hooks the theme of it /none/ resembles very much elements of his profession or at least  reminding you what he does so the oil weirdly does make it strangely erotic its your turn you  have 25 feet of movement so thatll only get you about five squares of movement  ashly okay im going to run im going to run  sam away  ashly away  sam jesus ugh youre the worst  ashly im roleplaying  matt are you running towards the action or away from it  ashly ill run towards this no im going to run towards those horses im /none/ going to run that way  matt make an acrobatics check to leap down  ashly terrible awful five  matt okay so you lose the last five feet of movement thats your movement there  ashly my javelin cant go very far right  matt your javelin has a pretty decent range does it have the ranges next to it in the app thats  okay i have it here the javelin its 30 and 120 feet so it can go 30 feet without  disadvantage and 120 feet with disadvantage  liam but you said everythings at disadvantage /none/  matt so you might as well  ashly might as well yeah so is protto within 120 feet  matt protto is right up there on the hill getting his arrows nocked  ashly okay i hate him definitively so im going to throw at protto with disadvantage five  matt completely passes over  ashly i can use my bonus action to move again or no i cant  matt no you cant thats where you are you can take another javelin attack because you have  three javelins  ashly ill try again  matt you get /none/ one more swing at him  ashly no doesnt work thats terrible i wont even bother  matt both javelins miss youre shaken by this experience  taliesin you did throw two javelins at an irritating creature so thats good  liam get the nerves out get the nervousness out  matt its now dwelmas turn dwelma is going to cast dispel magic  marisha does that mean i get to take an attack on her  matt not unless you have the war caster  marisha mage slayer  matt mage slayer i mean  marisha i almost took /none/ that took sentinel instead  taliesin its going to take two turns though right  matt she wasnt affected by slow  taliesin ah really  marisha yeah she was one of the ones that saved thats why i was trying to stun her  sam what do you cast dispel magic on  matt the magical effect which is the slow effect  sam and it will do it over all of the  matt if its any spell third level or lower the target ends so slow fades  sam oh no  marisha fuck thats why i /none/ was trying to stun her i think she still could have done it though  matt not from being stunned she couldnt  marisha oh well cool feels really good about failing it twice now  matt sorry shes going to move to this side actually and is going to run so you both get  attacks of opportunity on her  taliesin you get an attack of opportunity  marisha thats not very good at all 12  matt 12 is not going to hit not with barkskin sorry actually no she doesnt have barkskin  because of the /none/ ambush she hasnt had time to cast it so its an ac of 11 you do hit  marisha what she doesnt move anywhere  matt she is stuck there  taliesin well actually no can you freeze her  marisha shes not moving she cant move and she takes five damage  taliesin shes still between the two of us she couldnt have circled  matt no she circled around its when she leaves the range so she gets stuck there that ends her  turn now lorenzos turns going to trigger  sam what the fuck is that /none/ hes a dragonman what is this  ashly what is happening  liam that is huge  sam jesus what the fuck is that  liam i dont know thats your call  matt i think it just misses you its right there  liam thats why i go far away  ashly what the fuck  matt as a cone of cold bursts forth from whooshing lorenzo smiles as his friends have  come out of the way and this burst of freezing cold arcane energy swirls in front of him  flashfreezing everything in front including the cart /none/ actually  ashly so nott gets frozen too  matt nott has to make a reflex save beau and molly have to make sorry dexterity save oh  thats a relic  marisha natural 20  matt nice  sam you know what ill use my luck  taliesin 19  matt go for it  marisha yeah dont get frozen  sam terrible  marisha oh no  ashly oh no what was it  sam 11  matt oh buddy all right okay what did you roll  taliesin 19  matt 19 okay nott you take 41 /none/ points of cold damage  sam ill halve that  matt okay so you use your reaction to halve that  ashly did you say im sorry 41 fourone okay  matt molly you take that would be 20 points of cold damage  taliesin jesus christ  matt beau you take 20 points of cold damage  marisha fuck  taliesin 20 points  matt yep as it triggers and the frost finishes off in the space there lorenzo grinning looks  over his shoulder back at keg and goes like am i going to have to make a /none/ lesson here  sam oh no hes winning  matt that brings us to the top of the round nott youre up  sam all right i think i have to use an action to unlock this cage to pick the lock  matt go for it make your lockpick check  sam fuck you five plus i dont know what is it usually seven  matt dex and proficiency so it would be seven yeah  sam 12  matt its not enough you spend a moment and the lock is not going these are pretty intense cages  /none/ and you look over there and lorenzos standing there with the glaive  sam im going to move around the cages or between them so that i turn completely invisible  marisha thats a good call  matt you move through a very small gap theyre pushed up against each other make a strength  check to see if you can push through you might not be able to  sam nope thats a three  matt you cant push through it the cages are too close the small gap there you try to muscle it  but there are /none/ two to three people in each cage and you cant push though  sam can i use my bonus action to jesus what can i do for my bonus action i cant hide can i hide  matt you could try youre partially obscured  sam i got nothing else to do on a bonus action so yeah i will try to hide  ashly lorenzos eyeing him right now you said  sam ill go on the side of the cart and  matt lorenzos eyeing in that direction  sam ill hide off the side of the cart /none/  matt okay make a stealth check  sam oh thats wonderful its 29  matt you appear within your mind to have vanished from the current sight  sam of at least lorenzo  matt all righty that brings us to finishing nott beau your turn  marisha oh god damn this fucking druid im just going to lay into the druid  matt go for it  marisha okay first attack natural 20  matt oh snap  marisha thank you gil thats doubling dice damage big money come on six plus four ten  matt ten damage /none/ oof dwelmas looking rough  marisha really  matt yeah  marisha second attack 14 plus seven so 21  matt although technically when the slow spell finished a hypnotic pattern may have gone off  yeah that would have gone off so make your wisdom saving throw if you dont mind  liam no i dont mind at all  sam may i ask a weird question matt  matt yes  sam the guy that i was trying to break out of the cage is he alive  matt glancing around the area it looks like the people /none/ that were right on the outer edge of the  cages are frozen  sam would i have seen that before i tried to unlock the cage  matt the guy whos near you hes fine they blocked the impact there it was your latter half  that was sticking out that got blasted  sam okay cool  liam i rolled a 22  matt 22 all right so the hypnotic pattern does not affect you well done  marisha i did 11 damage on my second attack on her  matt she goes down  marisha fuck yes /none/  sam down like dead  matt like unconscious and bleeding out  taliesin do you have any more attacks left  marisha i have my bonus can i move and then attack again  matt yeah if you want to  taliesin or you could hit them while theyre down and help them bleed out  marisha i thought about that but i have enough movement that i can make it to the barbarian right  matt you could  marisha are you going to handle lorenzo whos going to handle lorenzo shouting whos going to  handle lorenzo /none/ fuck im going to jump over the horses asses and get to lorenzo  matt you are  taliesin oh dear  matt okay make an acrobatics check  marisha 14  matt you get over the horses where are you going to stand on the cart theres not a lot of room  here to stand to fight and youd have to get over  marisha i have 40 feet of movement so wherever i can go  matt ill say you can get back right here  sam yes land on the horses back  marisha can i /none/ land on the horses back  matt sure why not

going to spend another ki point to do patient defense i dont trust this motherfucker  hopefully thats useful  matt that ends your turn  marisha yeah  matt that brings us to ruzza ruzza who watched the druid go down /none/ sees you over there being  really defensive and looks around hes going to attempt to cast hold person at level three i need  mollymauk and beau to make wisdom saving throws please  taliesin motherfucker  sam you got this guys you got this big rolls  taliesin 25  marisha 21  matt completely resists it shit  liam burned it burn that shit  matt back up around the tree trunk there

close as  you get lorenzos technically supposed to be in that space  taliesin im going to take three attacks i do not have advantage obviously  matt no you do not  taliesin first attack is that cocked or is that okay  sam is it your big dice its cocked  taliesin /none/ damn it it was a 20 now its a 22  all whoa  matt take your damage  taliesin thats counting 18 points of damage  matt nice  taliesin not happy swipe number two thats a ten  matt ten does not hit  taliesin then the other one is a three that does not hit either  matt that first strike carves past you see blood spatter across the edge of the hillside lorenzos  like all right i see what youre doing one for one slams the glaive onto the ground that ends  your turn /none/ molly it is lorenzos turn lorenzos going to go ahead and make two glaive attacks  against you  taliesin i think i have a second blood maledict usage now  matt youre still level five  taliesin i know i was looking because i know you changed things and it says blood maledict  you can invoke a blood curse a number of times per short rest based on your levels 2nd one 5th two  9th three im taking hoping this die rolls worse come on for fucks sake my blood maledict  literally kills me actually no /none/ fuck was i going to do it advanced i was going to do it  advanced my own blood maledict knocks me unconscious  marisha you get knocked unconscious  taliesin i was at four hit points what was i going to do  marisha not that  sam oh god is he still going to attack you  matt first hit you guys watch as molly falls back unconscious lorenzo looks confused his  vision still obscured the blindness  marisha am i flanking molly  matt yeah actually youre not flanking because youre at an angle youre on /none/ the horse so no  the first strike slams down into mollys chest the blade actually sinking about seven inches into  the chest blood spatters out of your mouth you can use your reaction to make an attack  marisha i can as sentinel  matt as sentinel you can yes  taliesin thank you  marisha 14  matt 14 does not hit so it misses there  marisha fuck  matt lorenzo looks back over towards keg looks up at you beau and says an example it is  molly in the brief moments of consciousness what /none/ do you want to be your last words  sam oh no  ashly can i say wait  matt no  ashly hes in it its done  matt this is done  sam do you get a reaction do you have anything  ashly maybe i could talk to him  matt molly you have a brief moment as the consciousness and life leaves you what are your  last words  taliesin spitting with blood  sam oh god  matt as it slams into his face respect and then twists the blade the life leaves molly /none/  taliesin eyes never shut  matt its now prottos turn protto is going to take a single shot because he used his action  surge now that hes gotten two javelin tossed hes going to fire at you seeing that youre in  the proximity thats a natural two misses off your armor youre not even paying attention  youre looking over at this and you feel it deflect no impact caleb your turn  liam im going to hold my turn and cast a scorching ray at the sorcerer the moment they do  anything first i will /none/ get up off of prone into a crouch  matt okay the thugs take their turn both of them are going to  taliesin i might need to leave the table for a while  marisha no  matt theyre both going to back up and take two crossbow shots at beau you have your patient  defense on  taliesin yeah i cant watch this  sam oh god  matt that is still a 16 and a 17 they rolled  marisha 16 misses 17 hits  matt thats right first one you deflect out of the air /none/  sam catch it  matt no she already used her reaction and the other one is  marisha i can still use deflect missiles right to lower it  matt you use your reaction to do it but it rolled a 15 to hit you watching this happen  hear it deflected off the other one you catch and drop still looking down at mollys notmoving  body as lorenzo now grins back at you and says is it time for another or have you learned your lesson  marisha you should know i have no respect for authority /none/  matt then another life it is all right that ends thugs turn  sam im invisible  matt he does not see you  ashly as a quick reminder  matt counting youre the closest there the barbarian goes pulling in is going to use an  action to move up into melee with you but

item and pour acid on one of the locks see if  that opens it  matt okay you pour acid on the lock its /none/ going to take a moment acid isnt an immediate thing  if youre not going to splash it on somebody it has to eat through metal  sam well shit then i wont do that  matt you would know that as an alchemist  sam i will shit what do i do i cant kill anything here im going to try the lock im  going to try the lock theres nothing else i can do  matt all right  sam its a natural one  matt i think the signs are pointing in a direction what are /none/ you doing nott  sam yes so movement and bonus i will run towards caleb but not directly at the barbarian  marisha thats a lot of time  matt beau its your turn you see nott run  sam lets see movement is 30 how far could i have gotten with

nott fuck  matt theres a reflex for him to go ahead and take an attack of opportunity on you with his  glaive and then he flickers and looks back to keg seeming more interested in what she has to  say that ends your turn  marisha yeah  matt all right ruzzas going to walk up  marisha didnt you have a thing held for the sorceress  liam the moment she does anything that depends on how you want to interpret that /none/  matt the moment she does anything what were you going to cast  liam well i meant do anything i guess do anything to hurt us  matt okay as youre watching her very carefully shes going to do it shes going to  step up and cast cure wounds  sam whispering oh its a slave they get a slave  marisha theyre going to try and capture molly  sam yeah  matt mollys dead cure wounds isnt going to affect him she reaches out and touches lorenzo  and he heals up a bit she starts /none/ to try and pat the flames out a little bit and he shoos her off  now it is lorenzos turn because molly doesnt have a turn lorenzos looking at you and says  looks like we have an eyeforaneye scenario points off at dwelma who at this point has bled out  marisha shes dead  matt well say yes shes bled out at this point you say you want to be an example huh  ashly will you let them go  matt sure puts his hand up flames still curling up and burning his body which roll /none/  another d6  marisha another four damage  sam use your teleport spell  ashly i dont have one  matt puts his hand up with the glaive in the air and you watch as all the other thugs looking off  pull back their crossbows to the
