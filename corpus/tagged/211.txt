tavern	 the mysteries of the  beacon that you maintain youve retrieved your forever alcoholic flask thats where well begin  today friends as the early morning creeps up upon you the chilled morning air has left a bit  of ice and mist crawling across areas of the city floor from outside your window here in the leaky  tap tavern however though it is a gloomy morning there is already a general air of  celebration around glancing across more people are now shifting out into the street and city  around you music is beginning to creep into 
tavern	 the vicinity and you can hear muffling through the  nearby walls  laura well struck my lord  travis high voice well struck my lord  matt as you all awaken hearing this outside what do you wish to do  laura gasps its a celebration  sam your spidey sense is tingling  laura yes can you hear the difference  taliesin it sounds like theres very expensive things to drink and eat im going to get my pocketbook  sam lots of pockets to pick  marisha lots of bar brawls to start yeah  liam can 
none	 i ask a retroactive question caleb and maybe beauregard read all of siffs journal  matt yep  liam was anything more to be gleaned from reading the entire thing  matt just more understanding of the same notes you read before from what remains of the tome  you managed to quickly grab the cliff notes of it as you glanced through it and the more  information you pulled from it filled out that your thoughts on those tidbits were correct  liam okay and then the only other question i have is i dont remember what time 
none	 of day the  party ended the day if there was time i wouldve used paper and scrolls to transcribe into my book  if there was time  matt yeah theres been a few days you wouldve had time  liam okay good  laura is it the morning  matt it is the morning you have awoken  laura im going to spend a minute focusing on the mote and get a point  sam on the what the mote  matt she takes the beacon focusing on this strange artifact that you procured from the grip  
none	 of the xhorhasian assassin you feel yourself extend into it and now being your first time to  focus on it its a lot to take in you feel your essence shift into this space this strange  dimensional between though not fully understanding it youre brought the same image of  dozens of yourself and this sense of infinity there before you you see the strange gray mote  and you reach out in the way that you saw calebs hand reach at that moment you feel it shift and  vanish into your chest the warmth sifting into 
none	 the center of your rib cage and then your eyes  focus once more and youre back in your chamber  marisha well that was kind of cool  laura did you know that we have a special weapon now  marisha i do as of right now with you telling me  laura this thing you can get this mote of possibility basically you get to affect time  im not exactly sure how it works but its really cool  marisha do you feel all right  laura i feel really powerful and stuff inside  marisha like

none	 i heard a rumor last night that more are getting through i dont know  laura i wonder how i wonder if theres an underground passage that people arent seeing or  something or maybe they can go invisible or maybe they have an airship or maybe they can turn  into mist and fly through the air where people cant see them ive heard of people doing that  marisha all possibilities yeah  travis knocking yall up  marisha no  laura fjord come in  travis were going out  marisha im naked im not naked

town	 my glorious beard  matt your glorious beard right there frost beard  ashley i dont have a beard  matt no it gets really cold in the early morning and bits of frost have gathered at the edges of  your hair so you brush off it a bit as you gather yourself and look out past the street the  musics already starting to swell very strongly from a distance and a few musicians come by  playing on their own some folks are starting to rouse and begin cooking things the smell of meats  and fresh 
tavern	 morning meals are beginning to find your nostrils and you decide you probably should check in  ashley yeah ill go check in  matt you come in the rest of you all gather in the bottom tavern area of the leaky tap what  would you like to do  sam does anyone know how this festival works what are we celebrating again  laura the close of the harvest  sam its just for funsies and we go around and sample wares and things  marisha nott have you never been to a festival  sam ive been 
tavern	 to a festival  travis its general revelry you know drink eat dance  sam not a big one you know small ones  laura about what  sam you know end of the season and beginning of the season you know that sort of stuff peoples  weddings that sort of thing  matt theres a new female whos running the bar she is now also coming to consciousness shes  coming around to preparing the bar passed out face down looks to be in her early 50s or so  long black hair that goes just past the 
none	 chest area  laura the chest area  matt respectfully choosing words laura past her heaping bosom what do you want me to say  taliesin i think youve had enough  liam right around her titties the titty area  travis take that tuna away  taliesin its making you weird  matt laura bailey forwardthinking feminist laughter  laura im sorry  matt its all right  liam once you have a child i want you to turn on a dime like a tartuffe character and be matronly  and severe  sam dont curse  matt thats 
tavern	 not going to happen  laura dont talk about titties  matt anyway this female you havent seen before whos in the process of running the bar very much  in the same way that you saw wessek the dragonborn or previous before that claudia  laura whispering i wonder if thats the new owner  marisha yeah wait whats she look like did you say something  matt human 50s long black hair  laura past the tatas  marisha i bet thats her oh thats right i got so distracted by you  ashley ill walk in and 
none	 give them a nod and then go get an ale first things first  matt what can i get you  ashley just a big a drink an ale  matt easy enough to do ill be right back and she goes and fetches you a drink all right so  for this part of the festival are you going for an ale or a stiff drink  ashley an ale its morning  travis slow burn  liam i wonder if the new proprietor knows there is a dead person in the basement  sam its not a dead 
none	 person its a skeleton it seems old i mean i suppose its a dead person  liam that is exactly what it is  sam i guess so  laura was it a dead human or a dead tiefling or a dead  sam it seemed humanish  liam well there were no horns and when youre a skeleton your ears are rotted away so i do not know  laura it couldve been an elf  liam it couldve been  travis are there any people i dont know juggling and shit or any shows going on  matt 
tavern	 not in the tavern currently it seems most everyone outside is walking in one direction  though a lot of the folks that are starting to gather are all heading past the entranceway and  heading in a leftward path from looking out from the tavern  sam should we join them  travis yeah i want to see  taliesin i definitely want to see this  marisha you can carry booze in the streets here right its like vegas open carry  sam wait no not open carry open container  matt there you go you have seen 
none	 people walk with various drinks in their hand without an issue before  sam lets go  taliesin im very much about this well get that togo  marisha how was the new lady was she nice was she a bitch  ashley she just i mean she gives you your drink so i think its a nice woman to me  sam what was her name  ashley i have no idea  marisha i bet shes a bitch  laura why would you say that  marisha i dont know because i want to buy this place so 
none	 i dont want to like her  liam do you know that there is a dead person in the basement here  marisha maybe we can use that to run her out  laura theres a skeleton in the basement apparently  ashley oh  taliesin i sort of agree with nott on this i think there comes a point where its a skeleton  and not an actual dead person at this point i mean i know it is a dead person  liam i dont think thats correct actually i think its both things at the same time 
none	  taliesin i think theres a point where its like a piece of fruit but its been out so long that  even conceiving of it as a piece of fruit is not useful  marisha thats a good point  liam i am pretty sure thats incorrect  marisha do you call a cherry pit a dead cherry  travis i start walking towards the  laura could you still eat the body if you cant eat the body anymore then its not a person  liam you can eat anything if you are determined enough  taliesin that 
none	 is also a very fair point  matt fjord has left the schrödingers skeleton conversation  taliesin fjord dont you dare have fun without us im rolling out the door  matt go for it molly gives chase  laura i chase after them too  sam ill put on my mask and join  ashley slam down my go  matt at this point now the chilled late morning beneath the cloud covered skies the streets are  filled with all manner of people and families walking with baskets and colored streamers behind  them the large banners of 
town	 silk of the autumn colors that were previously being placed up in the  streets are in full display the gentle wind is causing them to flicker and flap as the music  weaves with the sound of the fabric small bands of bards and musicians mark nearly every street  intersection filling the air with music poems and cheer its a very stark difference to the  lockdown that held the city over the past week and a half or so the closer you begin to follow  the crowds as they move along hearing the chuckles of children 
town	 and the conversations and  laughter that seem to burble out of every street corner it pushes you in the direction of the  pentamarket thats when the smells of spices and incense begin to come in waves as you follow the  sauntering crowds eventually that smell overcome by the smell of cooked meat pies and roasted  vegetables billowing from the various food carts that line the corners of the streets before you  liam i want to be at ren faire  laura i know  matt the flickering of the wind is now this weird syncopation 
town	 thats blending with the sound of the  distant drums and ocarinas and flutes that are beginning to pipe into the strange din in the  streets you see a number of games of skill and chance that have been set up in the distance too  amongst the crowds as people begin to weave through to the left you can see someone loudly  proclaiming want to play trebuchet anyone and down the way another voice calling out kings  vault you can see more games in the distance beyond there more stages are set up with food and 
none	  its a veritable smörgåsbord of celebration what do you guys want to do  travis trebuchet sounds pretty fucking sweet  taliesin i think were immediately heading to trebuchet  marisha what do you mean is trebuchet like a trebuchet  travis how the fuck do we know were going to find out though  taliesin do you fire it do you sit in it i dont know theres only one way to find out  liam im going to start walking towards the other one the kings thing  laura all by yourself caleb  sam im going 
none	 with caleb want to come  laura i want to get thrown in a trebuchet  sam go with them then  laura okay does it seem like there are more guards around than usual are the guards relaxed  matt the guards are relaxed but theres definitely a large presence and in fact a number  of the games are run by the guards in fact trebuchet as you approach you see two guards  male and female that are both in the process of lifting a three or four year old girl and she has  a sandbag 
none	 in her hand theyre like one two three and she throws it and it gets close but  stops before the basket but they cheer her on yay and set her down  marisha aww i thought they were going to throw her  laura like a wonder child  liam dont worry if she falls they kill her  matt the kid runs off and grabs the bag and comes back and they lift her again they go one  two and they give her even more of a swing so she gets a little more distance it hits 
town	 the edge  and then tips off to the side and they go aww and the crowd who had gathered around awws with  her the little girl smiles and gives them a hug and then runs off one of the guards turns as you  guys begin to approach and shouts to the crowd trebuchet anyone wish to play  travis yes most definitely  matt five copper for three throws  travis yeah heres ten copper for molly and me  matt sipes the other guard goes all right pulls up three of the sandbags and hands them 
none	 to  you that basket there and that line there you see that they were in between for the kids reach  but theres about a tenfoot distance of small thin carpet thats placed behind the line leading  to this open wicker basket thats about a foot and a half wide you have to throw overhead facing away  travis oh shit  sam kareem abduljabbar  laura do we need to pick them up and do the thing like you did with the child  matt you are more than welcome to try id love to see that 
none	 happen that is not necessary  travis no its all right let me try it on my own first for dignitys sake  matt as you stand there you take the sandbag and in a trebuchetlike motion lob it overhead  without quite looking assuming the direction go ahead and make a dexterity check with disadvantage please  travis i didnt need that disadv thats a natural one  laughter  sam 100 for 826la  matt you lob it and hear pained grunt and everybody goes oh and you turn around  travis sorry friend yeah thats a purple 
town	 heart sorry man jeez  matt you turn around you can see the mother of the small kid that was first throwing and shes  rubbing the side of her face  laura you hit a mother  travis find her a soothing something to take the pain off  matt she goes ah its fine looks up at you and goes come on she grabs her kids arm and  they both leave deeper into the crowd  laura you should have let me and yasha pick you up  travis no ive got this resituate grab a bit 
town	 of a glance grunts  matt all right try again  travis thats another natural one  liam chaching  matt as you one two  travis this happened at ren fair before  matt you go to heave the sack and as it does it gets caught on part of your breastplate and as you  pull upward theres a ripping as sand goes scattering into the sky around emptying the bag  and pouring over you into your eyes spitting laughter starts to gather in the crowd around and  some small clapping  marisha again again  
none	 travis i cant believe im about to say this but lets give it a try  laura gasps okay yasha you get on one side ill get on the other  ashley okay thats fine  matt well you have one more throw  travis thats what i mean i got them helping me  matt which one of you is taking the other throw  laura oh no were going to pick fjord up the way that you did the little child  matt oh perfect there you go  travis two shit throws in a row it cant 
none	 get any fucking worse  liam come on one  yes yes yes  ashley no  liam yes yes  matt thats ridiculous  ashley seriously throw that away  laura you need to put that shit in jail  taliesin you shouldnt have hit that woman with a sandbag  liam thats all right you got them out of the way when we fight a basilisk later all those  ones are gone  matt jester yasha how do you want to do this  laura we throw fjord  ashley yeah i dont think we help him 
none	 we just whoosh  matt they literally shot put fjord about three or four feet surprised grunt  ashley did we get him in  matt no he gets about four feet before he goes face first into the carpet the carpet balls up in  front of him as he skids for another foot foot and a half with his feet up in the air before  they come to rest theres a dust cloud theres a loud gathering of voices going ooh and then  silent as the music plays in the distance  travis coughing i think 
town	 that might have im going to get a drink you guys carry on  ow my pride  ashley and laura molly  matt the female guard goes and straightens out the carpet to get it right five copper  taliesin no he paid already  matt oh thats right then by all means  taliesin its a dexterity with disadvantage  matt because youre looking away its not a hard dc but  taliesin 19  matt 19 whoosh thud whoa the crowd begins cheering yeah  laura yay molly  matt they hand you a second one  
none	 laura does he get a prize  matt at the end  taliesin i think i may have to ive spent my luck i think it may be off to you and then one for you  ashley oh okay  laura really  taliesin three throws one each  laura okay  ashley by all means jester  sam jester use these  laura no  oh no  taliesin its still not terrible  laura i rolled two twos  taliesin thats a six  matt jester you throw it with all your strength and it goes straight

town	 if there are any more games  matt you glance around keeping an eye open as you guys continue youve now hit the deeper edge  of the pentamarket the crowds around you are fairly dense at this point there are people  laughing and talking theyre carrying various baked goods that are fresh out of the nearby carts  or oven the smell creeps into your senses and takes over from that point children run past and  bump you in the side some are holding two ends of a streamer and the streamers continue past and  flap 
none	 around hitting people its adorable and delightfully intense the guard presence is very  much felt here but everyone is in high spirits you get the sense that everyone has been waiting  to get to this festival to this moment here its a much different atmosphere than the gala you had  seen a week before in the trispires  travis they needed this catharsis it feels like  taliesin quite a party  marisha i want to find the most ridiculous mead out there  matt oh there are quite a few mead stands so its easy enough 
none	 for you make an investigation check  travis meat or mead  marisha mead  laura i want to find the candied apples  marisha 17  matt very easy to find through a couple of sleight questions to some of the noncompetitive  barkers you manage to find a small meadery stand thats near the outskirts of one of the large  arena structures that you havent seen used since you arrived in this city as you approach the  older guy there with this curled and unkempt chinbeard that looks like part of it isnt  growing on 
dung	 the right side you approach and he has all this thick dark jugs of mead and he is like  hey you want some mead  marisha yeah do you have mead that doesnt taste like piss  matt i have mead thatll get you fucked up  marisha thatll do  matt might taste like piss still  sam he did not answer your question  liam thatll do pig  marisha whats your highest proof mead  matt he picks up one jug sniffs that one and hold it out for you to smell its pretty strong  
none	 it smells slightly acrid but not in a bad way just in a strong mead way  travis slightly vinegar  marisha still smells like piss man  matt welp depends what you want do you want strong or do you want tasty you got to pick  marisha strong  travis oh yeah good choice  matt thatll be a nice fair filled cup for a silver  taliesin this about when i run up whatd you get  marisha barbarian pee but its good  taliesin what are the options  matt he pulls up three jugs he 
none	 says this end tasty this end fuck you up this one little bit  of a little bit of b  taliesin ill take whatevers most expensive  matt grabs the same stuff that beau got the heavier thick stuff pours gives you a cup full  of it thatll be a silver piece  taliesin mmhmm  matt takes it its strong the aftertaste isnt too bad its the initial weird sour vinegary  impact but then the sweetness comes in afterward it sets well and its strong as you guys are  walking around and keeping an eye 
tavern	 you do see there is another stand that has an elevated  platform called titans grasp there are four soldiers of the righteous brand the empire  military that are currently manning it theyre wearing their plate mail of silver and  darkcrimson design a large cubed stone two feet by two feet is set on top of this platform  with a metal bar that is wedged beneath it that its leaning against the metal bar has a  cylindrical center point like a fulcrum there is a large hammer that one of them is currently  holding to 
tavern	 the side as you begin to approach you see one guy there whos currently spitting into  his hands grabs the hammer grunts as he hits the metal bar the stone goes slight scraping  barely shifts he sets down the hammer and everyones like yay and he goes i moved it  steps down off the platform  travis theyre celebrating anything these days  laura yasha  ashley and laura we should go play this game  ashley i was really looking forward to looking for ridiculous meats not meads but maybe we can  marisha oh meat 
none	 sounds great too  travis yeah the day is young  ashley lets go play this game  travis not play crush this game  laura we get a candied apple okay  matt you approach the four soldiers that are up there one of them comes up to you the one who  has the hammer at his side after retrieving it from the last person goes hey all right are  you willing to play some titans grasp eh  ashley and laura yeah  matt all right its five silver an entry  laura five silver

tavern	 hammer its not too heavy in your grasp  travis come on yasha  matt its not very well balanced either its not a battleready hammer its designed for this type  of a show experience you get the sense this hammer would not be the most effective for this  it might be intentional its your turn people start gathering youre up on an elevated two foot  platform there they have the metal bar fulcrum all set beneath the stone hammers in your hands  what do you do  ashley okay so i would like to rage 
tavern	 ah just strength  matt this is a strength check yeah you have advantage while youre raging roll twice take  the higher and add your strength modifier  ashley oof okay 17  matt 17 grunts ringing impact you hit the metal bar the stone scraping falls back into  rest its a heavy stone  laura what are we trying to do here  matt the stone is resting on the lower part and there is a fulcrum round centerpiece to it youre  trying to hit on this end to push the stone to roll over it 
none	 moved slightly and falls back into  place good try that was very strong there lass dont worry  ashley well i have another go  matt well pay another  ashley i did i gave you ten  matt oh you did tell me this when youre counting this bud go ahead second swing  taliesin you get another swing yeah  matt you get advantage while raging so  ashley 24  travis and laura ooh  matt you pull back and the one guy is looking over to one of the mates on the side and starts 
town	  laughing suddenly impact scraping larger impact the stone shifts slams on to the other  side all four of them go gasp  cheering  laura yasha  matt now suddenly the crowd around that you didnt notice gathering start cheering yay  looks over to the one guard who had the pouch okay then congratulations  ashley thank you  matt hands it over  ashley can i count it  matt yeah go for it you take a moment to count through while staring at him it comes out to  roughly about 43 gold worth of 
none	 silver including the ten silver that you put into it or not  including the ten silver so in addition to that it would be 44 gold worth but its mostly silver pieces  ashley oh shit how much  liam about seven feet away out of habit caleb just went counting  laura that will buy us so many candied apples  matt all the guards go over and shift the stone back over onto the fulcrum they pull in and bring  out about a gold piece each to throw five gold back into the pot they go 
none	 all right back up  who wants in  ashley shes next  laura oh well all right five gold is all right  travis ill toss in a gold piece just to make it interesting  taliesin oh yeah no ill do that when i see you going in  laura what you guys  matt the guards are going wait into the  laura youre going to play right  travis for the game right  sam i will take that bet ill bet against her  laura what  travis sure  sam i got one gold 
none	 that says she cannot do this  marisha im the booker so you pay me  sam i dont think thats how that works  laura i roll for strength check  matt yup roll a strength check add your strength modifier  laura natural 20  cheering  matt resounding impact as you slam down again the stone goes impact it rolls over a second time  travis two in a row  matt seemingly the fulcrum set after you knocked it over prepared her for a better slam as it  hits the four soldiers of the righteous 
none	 brand look at each other were going to take a break  here for a second return here in about 30 minutes they hand the money over to you get  five six gold  laura seven gold  travis nott  sam heres one gold i just wanted to fire her up  laura thanks nott it worked  sam i know  matt theyre going to inspect the hammer inspecting the fulcrum inspecting the stone and  theyre basically in the process of wondering if they had somehow been cheated out of this they  cant find anything 
none	  laura i skip away  matt at this point now the smell of warm candied fruit begins to waft past you you glance  over and can see there is a large cart that is selling all sort of sweet fruit that have been  coated in sugar some have a sticky syrup exterior and there are candied apples available  for purchase depends on how much you guys want to purchase if any  ashley i would very much i have never had a candied apple before  laura you have to try them theyre so good  
none	 sam youve never had a candied apple before it seems so basic its honey and an apple  laura well the candied apples are hard right the caramel apples are softer do you have caramel apples  matt you can see the older woman whos there who a little bit portly with a big smile rosy cheeks  pulls from behind the counter theyre still cooling off you can see a small tray that has  about six caramel covered apples that you see are still gleaming in the little bit of light thats  coming from the cloudy sky 
none	  laura yes thats what i wanted  liam i havent had one of those in such a long time  laura im going to buy one for all of us  matt all right thats going to be  sam we have to share one  matt two copper each for seven thatll put you at 14 copper  laura okay how much does that add up to in silver  taliesin one silver four copper  laura okay i pass it over  matt theres six caramel apples here and you have seven with you  travis its 
none	 okay no it gets stuck in your teeth  ashley ill take the candy because ive never had it  matt candy apple all right for you and the six for you shouting all out of caramel apples for  the time being but return here in an hour  laura an hour you have to wait because we got all of them  laughter  matt theres this little girl across the way whos like  laura aw i cut a little slice off and give her one little slice  matt you approach and she gets scared as 
none	 you get closer you can see she looks a little  disheveled probably one of the less welloff people of the city of zadash you dont see a  parental figure in the near vicinity  laura wheres your mama do you have a mama is she around  matt just runs off  laura oh no i was going to give you more but okay goodbye  sam should we go after her i can hunt her down  laura no  liam while i start to enjoy my apple i would like to look around and see if 
town	 there are any book  stalls or book barrels  sam those festive book stalls  taliesin a barrel of books  matt go ahead and make a perception check  sam candied books candied books  travis the little girl disappeared into the crowd or did she join a bunch of other kids  matt she disappeared into the crowd  liam perception you said  sam throw a dart win a book  liam 15  matt it does not appear that there is a strong presence of tome andor book retailers as part of  the celebration 
none	 unfortunately  liam okay while i was looking round is there anything besides games and food  matt theres games theres food there are celebratory tapestries in the colors of autumn  you see small pressed crests of the empire that are used to either hang over your door as a good  luck charm or to use as decor on the interior a lot of its knickknacks and general collectibles  most everyone out here its a craft fair on top of being a celebratory theres a bunch of random  odds and ends that people collect or purchase 
none	 to add to their home interior  liam huge long shot probably a no but do i also see anything about the cobalt soul here  matt glancing about you do see the occasional person of the cobalt soul robes but theyre not  selling anything here  taliesin im going to run up behind caleb have you run detect magic on any of this  liam well you know i tried to do a little stuff on the sly a little while ago and didnt work out so well  taliesin just theres so much i figure somethings got 
none	 to be interesting  liam well if you can keep eyes off of me for a moment i can do that if you like  taliesin i can absolutely do that im going to run towards the tapestry booth  matt okay  laughter  matt there you can see its a long thin cart thats mainly things on display it looks like  its two wooden dowel rods at each side of this booth that all push together at the center all  the tapestries are hung over the side on display for the front end theres three individuals 
none	 that  are manning this booth there isnt a whole lot of transaction going on there its a little more of  a specialty item in the sense that not everyone needs to fill their place with tapestries theyre on display  taliesin im seeing if theres anything deeply gaudy  matt yes actually there is one that is an insignia or an interpretation of the symbol of the  platinum dragon it is silver threads among a standard skyblue coloring theres several  different dragon heads that are woven into the pattern theres almost an embroidery for as much 
none	  as youve known about the platinum dragon and the religion its surprisingly gaudy  liam im trailing about 40 feet behind molly  taliesin thats beautiful how much is that then  matt one of the people running the booth quickly as you see a mid30s halfelf man with a  bit of chin scruff and very short hair leans around the corner and goes oh for the platinum  dragon this one was handcrafted by me and my mate over the period of about two months hand  embroidered very difficult very exquisite for the entire piece the 
none	 central piece youre  inquiring about thatll run you about ten gold pieces we have smaller almost doilysized  renditions of it back here  taliesin how big is this piece out of curiosity  matt he takes the back and unfolds it entirely but cant quite get the full arm length to get up  there hes like this ones about six and a half seven feet from top to bottom can be used  as a rug should you be so inclined and you arent quite a fan of the platinum dragon and want him  beneath your 
none	 feet  taliesin its purchased ten gold my god  matt right away he takes it begins folding it up with one of his other compatriots they take  the twine and manage to fasten it in three places  taliesin bless you master craftsmen my god it is such a rendition of the platinum dragon that  ive never seen before i clutch at my platinum dragon brooch its beautiful  matt he says were happy to bring joy to you and the house of your great deity they hand you  this relatively massive tapestry thats almost seven 
town	 feet end to end  taliesin oh i have fucking plans people swing it over my shoulder and ill be walking around  like a pike  matt as this is happening you see that there are two other games youre now seeing the central  space here youve walked past this structure its this small forumlike circular stone  building thats been emptied and closed now theres crowds walking in and out the front  doorway and around it are where a lot of these games are set up you do see one that has a big  banner 
none	 that says eagle shot there is one large central platform where it looks like this is where  a lot of public presentations are given here in the pentamarket its currently set up with a  central table and a number of members of the righteous brand as well as one that is a very  welladorned human male with brown hair thats pulled up into a topknot he has a big thick  beard looks like a handsome fellow and hes currently barking out something about the  military youre too far away to make out the details of 
none	 it that one has a wooden carved sign  that says soldiers spirit its currently put on the edge of the stage  laura where in relation to all of this is the hearth of the allhammer because i know its in  the pentamarket  matt the hearth of the allhammer would be on the other side of this large forumlike structure  sam im going to walk over to the eagle shot was it  matt eagle shot yes  sam whats that game look like  matt as you approach there are two crownsguard that are helming 
none	 a small compact archery range  theres a series of trees that are at the very back that mark what would normally be an alcove in  this small park but within this alcove there are three archery targets that are slightly off from  each other at different distances they have a rack with different bows and a whole cache of  arrows that are set to the side  marisha laughter im just standing there like what  sam bows nah  laura you could do it  sam its too hard to pull it back this thing 
none	 does it for you look click  laura and marisha maybe theyll let you use it  sam i guess i could go ask excuse me sir or madam  matt the first guard turns around oh little girl good to see you what can i help you with  sam im wondering if you have to use a bow and arrow to compete or can you use one of these  matt what do you  which you still have a bolt nocked in this hand crossbow hes like put the   sam im not going to fire 
none	 it at you i dont have anything wrong with it  matt little miss you shouldnt be waving that around in public im not sure how you got a hold  of that wheres your mother  sam my father is over there  liam did you want to play this game  sam yes papa  matt unfortunately by the rules you have to use one of the provided bows  sam this one is pretty good  matt please put sir your daughter is a danger to the general public right now  liam no she is an 
none	 excellent shot shes trained  matt well she has not been trained proper use of that in a space in which is it safe for other  people to be around im just saying  liam sure how much to play your game  matt could i see that for a second  liam my daughters crossbow you want  matt takes it the crossbow and pulls the string back removes the tension hands it back there  would either of you like to play some eagle shot behind them somebody like  sam now i feel like we have 
none	 to he just humansplained me  laughter  matt the other guard behind is currently setting up an older woman who is in the process of getting  the arrow lined up and it keeps falling out of her grip and the other guards like no put it  here and getting ready finally fires an arrow and it goes and disappears past one of the trees  oh no  liam well you know ill tell you something if you want to have a laugh lets have me do some  physical sports so that should be pretty good 
none	  sam thatll be fun all right lets do it we will both enter your competition  matt very well thats one silver piece for three shots closest bullseye if acquired you  get a rat from a cage he pulls off from the side here you see a small stack of wicker cages with  rats inside them get yourself a pet rat if you go ahead and get that middle bullseye about part  way across that range there you win yourself one of these finely crafted wooden swords they have  this decently whittled wooden sword the 
none	 center cross hilt for it is strapped with twine tightly  swings it a couple times and sets it down lays it against and it rests and hits the ground off to  the side now the farthest one over there and you watch as the old woman pulls another shot and  it almost hits the far target before it gets stuck in the tree about ten feet behind it hit that  one way back there and that one will get you this he pulls up a haphazard stitched doll with  button eyes like the stitches are 
none	 too wide so it looks like the crosses behind it are visible  theres no mouth theres like matted twine hair some feltlike material thats made a crown and a  cape of our fine king bertrand dwendal  liam just a question for you should i hit the one in the back which is highly likely could we  have the dolls weight in rats instead  matt he gives you a look like you said a bad word he goes i suppose  sam how far is the farthest one  matt he glances back its probably about 
none	 80 feet  sam lets try  marisha nott i really want that wooden sword  sam you dont have a sword do you  travis creepy little doll man  marisha dont listen to fjord  laura get the doll i bet its cursed  sam i cant work with this kind of pressure  marisha nott if you get that sword ill give you my jade bracelet  sam oh man  liam is this an attack roll  matt it is an attack roll and its a short bow he said about 80 feet but the farthest 
none	 ones  about 100 feet which means it is in its second range increment so the one in the back is at disadvantage  sam im not proficient in this thing at all right  matt well lets go ahead and see rogue proficiencies its a simple ranged weapon you  should be im pretty sure you are yep simple weapons you are proficient with the short bow  whos going first if you dont mind me asking  liam let me show my daughter how it is done  matt of course understood hands you one of the short 
none	 bows off of the side and three arrows  theyre all right in their construction  liam watch my form and technique i pick up the bow and i take the stick thing i pull it back like this  matt oh i  liam yeah  matt no continue  liam sneezes  matt which target are you aiming for  liam the farthest one obviously  matt the farthest all right with disadvantage add your dexterity modifier  liam oh  matt i do not think youre proficient  liam aww no not at all that is a 
none	 three  matt well as a wizard you might be actually for simple weapons  nope no you are not  taliesin is it just simple weapons or is it simple ranged weapons  matt well its simple ranged weapons but those count as simple weapons  taliesin simple weapons okay  matt it gets about 40 or so feet before it gets stuck in the dirt hes like that was good  liam hmm the fretching on that one was probably not very good let me try again  sam i think its fletch yeah  liam listen i 
none	 have read a lot of books i know it is fretching  matt you nock your secondary arrow take a shot  liam nope dang it the second rolls are always really good that is an eight  matt this one gets about five feet further and almost hits a squirrel you hear squeaking and  it darts off into a nearby bush  laura you could have got your own prize  sam one more shot you can do this  liam this is not wellcrafted i grab my wire that i use for the message spell and i 
none	 put my  hair into a little ponytail  laura you shouldnt use wire to do that caleb  marisha it damages your hair  liam pew okay oh no ten  matt this one gets 40 feet which is halfway there before it hits the ground and sticks into  the dirt as soon as it finishes theres like a that was good go fetch that the other guard  runs out and grabs the arrows to retrieve them  liam full disclosure i have no athletic ability that went as well as i expected it to  matt 
none	 that is surprising well a fine harvest close to you friend and for your daughter  sam yes its my turn  matt hands the bow over and a set of three arrows  laura hes going with the dice jail dice you should not have done that  sam do i add proficiency and  matt proficiency and your dex mod  sam 11  matt this one arcs it almost gets near the target but ends up veering off to the right and  ends up vanishing behind one of the secondary targets near the tree he says 
none	 yeah that was  better than your father  sam what is that 12  matt this one hits the actual base of the far target misses the target entirely but it hits  the actual plank of wood thats holding it up  marisha see the beads have a little bit of like gold embossing etching inside of them  sam far target 15  matt it hits the bottom of the target no bullseye but you hit it hes like that was  actually very good  sam shut up i dont need you to condescend to me 
none	 give me another one  matt right away little missy grabs three more arrows  liam i slap down the silver for it  sam thank you  liam yeah it was two right  matt one silver for three shots  liam i put down two silver  matt six more shots all right there you go  laura she wont need six more shots  sam two in quick succession 20  matt as you pull back perfect bullseye into the farthest target theres this brief pause as the  guard spins around and goes what   
none	 sam im not done i get four more shots two in quick succession to the middle one  taliesin is it still disadvantage to the middle target  matt middle one is not at disadvantage  sam oh well then should i reroll okay i will still use your shitty dice two 23s  matt both arrows were talking like disney robin hoodstyle one arrow next one splits the  first arrow the guards still recovering from the first bullseye hes like what  sam then two more to the short one 16 and a 21  matt both hit 
none	 at the same time the guard looks slowly over towards you well done  liam now go home and get your fucking shinebox  matt heres your doll  taliesin and the sword  matt two swords  laura two swords  ashley i thought it was the rats  matt two rats  laura double rats  ashley double rats yeah thats it because i thought that was dinner we have  taliesin were not eating the rats  laura well find some other dinner yasha  ashley its my favorite  matt you now have in your inventory 
none	 two rats in rat cages two wooden swords  sam you can have both wooden swords  marisha oh thanks  travis yasha do you eat rat a lot  matt a handstitched doll of king bertrand dwendal  laura thats a really good doll  sam oh it really is would you like the rats  ashley well were you going to eat one  sam well we can share  travis alive or do you cook it  ashley no i like to have it cooked it falls off the bone its like a nice  sam oh 
none	 i can wait i guess  liam it really depends on what you have at your disposal yeah  sam later itll be a celebratory we could candy them  laura or caramel them  ashley lets try it  laura can i start to wander away towards the allhammer  marisha look guys im molly look i want to go over to the military booth  sam dont cut yourself  matt while this is happening jester you make your way around the large forum and there you see  the hearth of the allhammer youve passed it before 
none	 and you can see its the domed iron  structure its been left to rust a bit at the edges the tops of the dome are polished where  its easily accessible but the very peak of the dome is a little bit red brown rusted there are  a number of open arches in the inside and you see the large central forge that marks the center of the temple  laura is there a statue of the allfather the allhammer guy  matt you do see the large anvil that marks there has the symbol of the allfather 
none	 printed on each  side and acts as both a ceremonial anvil for the creation of religious artefacts and items as part  of worship and as the central statue for worship itself that is the closest thing there is in this  temple to a central focus of worship  travis nott be real careful with that doll they put little spirits of kids in those  laura is there any guards around or are they mostly gone because of the celebration  matt its not busy on the inside because right now everyones focus is on the actual 
dung	 celebration  there are three individuals that are manning the interior of the temple one of which is the  herald each temple in the city has a herald thats the keeper of that temple its a female  dwarf dark brown hair and three long braids that trail past to the middle back with a chainmail  robe on that descends past the knees and is currently sitting on a bench and eating dried meat  out of a small pouch and people watching as people walk by the temple nobodys in there actively  worshipping at the moment 
none	  laura i go inside  sam burn the place down  matt do you go in trying to avoid attention or are you announcing yourself as you arrive  laura no im going to casually walk in just you know  matt as you walk in a voice in the corner from the direction of where the herald was goes miss  if you need something dont be afraid to let me know were just sitting around  laura thank you  matt of course  laura oh i should have disguised myself first i leave go literally right 
none	 around the corner and  disguise myself and i come right back in  matt what do you disguise yourself as  laura i cast disguise self as an old woman oof who just burped  matt you  laura no it wasnt me with like a really tight bun and little teeny glasses and a cane i guess i  cant make myself have a cane can i  matt no thats not an extension of  laura all right well i walk kind of hunched over  matt okay as you come around the corner and make your 
none	 way in you saunter in the far end of the  temple through one of the arches that marks the interior come in through the shadow and the  herald once again goes if you need something right over here  laura grumbling  matt all right thats fine goes back to chuckles already seems taken aback by your  presence what do you want to do  laura is there anybody in there nobodys in there  matt well i mean theres people in there  laura whispered oh shit  matt theres the herald whos sitting in the 
town	 back eating on the opposite end of the anvil and  theres two other folks that are on the outskirts of the arches looking out into the crowd just  people watching  laura okay im going to walk around to the back end of the anvil and act like im praying but im  going to wait until it looks like theyre all looking the other direction  matt as you begin to pray the two others that are on the outside whove noticed you enter  their attention doesnt wander to you for too long before they go 
none	 back out to the celebration people  walking by and people watching in general youre on the opposite side of the anvil from the herald  whos still chewing on her meat what do you want to do  laura i would like to get my paint set out and paint pink hearts all over the back side of the  anvil along with the traveler was here then im going to leave a couple travel brochures for the  traveler yeah i think thats good but theyre sizeable hearts i want nice pretty pink all over  the hammer 
none	 the anvil  matt just for the sake of presentation because youre doing this with a bit of haste knowing  that youre under pressure go ahead and roll a performance check  laura okay with a pink dice thats pretty good 18  matt 18 as you quickly begin to finish this heart traveler was here you hear yawning  across the way from the herald you stop for a second no reaction continue going you finish  up the art piece one of the other guardians of the temple begins to turn around and walk back  towards 
none	 the herald and you pull back for a moment but they turned away from you and it seems that  youve managed to go this far without being noticed you finish up your last heart the  exclamation point and the underline of the traveler  laura oh and im going to take some sequins off of my sequins glove and sprinkle it on there  matt tinkling  liam a little granny painting furiously  matt just straining you put the pamphlets there on the side slip them beneath the offering  bowl at the base of it

none	 up for this  matt he pulls out a copper coin thats a little larger than a normal piece of copper and goes just ask around  he tosses it to you and you take it it looks like a small copper platter coinish in its design and  on it is printed the name of his group the stubborn stock  sam theyve got business cards that is so cool  laura we need to get coins  marisha we need coins yeah  sam we need something  ashley how do i what do i show it around

none	 we okay we wait 30 seconds one two  sam while were waiting can i just say why did we not think about branding we should have coins  cards you should be writing a big nine on a wall wherever we go like everywhere just tagging it  just everywhere  laura why a nine though  sam because were the mighty nein  laura i thought the nine meant that  sam i know they dont know that when you say it out loud its much easier that our symbol is the  number nine dont you think 
none	  taliesin i think that if i saw lots of random nines around the city i dont think id know what  that was connected to  sam if you did know then youd be one of the cool kids  marisha if you saw random mimes  laura im going to start practicing making a cool logo for us in my sketchbook  liam i am on an errand  matt what errand are you on  liam oh well ill wait until they wind down perhaps  sam that could be a while  liam it could be 
none	 a while well back at the righteous brand when i snuck out would it be  possible for me to find an alleyway or somewhere secluded so i can cast disguise self on myself  around myself not as myself  matt yeah a short jaunt not too hard to find a darkened corner where you can do it  liam yeah okay then i would like to look exactly like i do however the clothing that im  wearing is a shade of blue that is similar but not identical to the robes that i have seen  people 
town	 from the library of the cobalt soul a similar blue and very large coke bottle glasses  my eyes go all fisheyed everything else is the same  matt okay easy enough to do  liam i would like to find one of those people who was dressed like they came from that library that  i saw that day with beauregard  matt okay make an investigation check as you begin to pore through the crowd doing this you  guys have noticed that calebs been gone for a little bit  liam its investigation you said  matt 
town	 yes  liam its a 24  matt wow yeah within a very short time asking a few questions and looking through part of  the crowd one of them points over to the edge of the pentamarket on the northern side and over in  that direction there are two of the robewearing individuals one of the monks that works within  the archive itself and one looks to be wearing higher up robes youre not sure what that means  or what the ranking is within the cobalt soul  liam i would like to approach them  
none	 matt all right as you approach  liam yeah excuse me im sorry may i trouble you for a moment i know this is untoward in the  middle of a festival  matt the one thats in the nicer dress you can see is apparently an elven woman you see these  kind of long strands of blond almost silver hair that goes in front of the ears and the rest of the  hair falls past the shoulders beautiful natural no makeup even for elven standards you can see a  little bit of age this is an 
none	 older elf in comparison to a lot of the brighter faces that  turns to you of course what can we help you with  liam oh yeah again i am very sorry i am a traveling writer i am writing a history of the  great cities of the empire and i have heard wonderful things about the library that is under  your stead and i dont know i have viewed it from the outside it is a beautiful structure but  i dont know what it entails to visit it i was wondering do you allow outsiders 
none	 i dont know if  it costs a fee or if you need some sort of letter of recommendation but i am very eager to learn  about the library itself and the city and everything that i can learn about it so i can  write more extensive it would just mean so much to me  matt make a deception check  liam its all true though  matt well  liam laughs it is a 13  matt a 13 okay well of course it is open to the public youre required to come when there is 
none	  an available monk to escort you through the premises of course you cannot take anything from  the archive itself but youre welcome to read while in the presence of one of our various monks  andor worshippers of the knowing mistress  liam the entire library  matt well the public portions of it yes  liam oh of course  matt yes just need to come on a day in which the archive is open and available sign in and  you will be assigned one of our various attendees of the archive and you will have 
none	 the run of the  public library of which to read and make notes of you may take your own copy of notes but once of  course it is only within the public space  liam it is far simpler than i had imagined  matt yeah well im glad you asked  liam thank you so much forgive me this is forward what is your name  matt im jennah archivist jennah  liam it is a pleasure this is a different subject almost entirely but i was wondering i  mean to make a stop at all 
none	 the great libraries of this city i was wondering is it a similar  situation at the hall of erudition  matt they are a little different they maintain their knowledge for those who are actually there  as part of the curriculum youll have to speak to the headmaster as well they have from what we  know as we are not allowed either quite a decent cache of arcane knowledge as well there has been  some sharing but they are particular  liam what was the headmasters name  matt that would be ornit i believe let 
none	 me double check here so i dont say it wrong no  that is no oremid hass  liam oremid hass  matt yes  liam oremid haas is running the halls of erudition  matt yes  liam okay apropos of nothing i have heard about this tower attack thats terrible  matt yes that was a bit disconcerting definitely thankfully it is a welldefended  tower the zauber spire has stood for quite some time and has its capabilities defending itself as  weve seen  liam im amazed it did not fall  matt well you should 
none	 ask them how they did that youll know as to why theyre so secretive  liam do they accept oh no they dont accept visitors there  matt well i dont know we always go on specific business so you can certainly inquire i  havent attempted to go from the standpoint of a possible student but you could ask  liam well i have taken up enough of your time  matt that is all right  liam id like to say thank you have a wonderful festival  matt of course you as well happy harvest close

dung	 this is another human man in probably his early 60s or so who has graying hair that is  slicked back and even further thinned than the gentleman who first met you on the way in who has  a very well groomed goatee that comes to an accentuated curve up underneath in the front hes  wearing a finely tailored dark blue festival suit  marisha ooh styling  matt the barker says these are the ones who and the older guy goes ah its far too late in  the day we couldnt muster a very well i

none	 are brought down to an area that is similar to that lounge area but far  less in its decor and comfort this chamber has two windowed doors on the opposite side that are  cut through windows that lead into the central arena you can smell the dust on the opposite  side the interior is outfitted with about three dozen simple stools that are scattered about a  few tables with cornucopias of fruits and meats that are set and a few folks you see are feasting  on them there are two stationed healers of the platinum 
none	 house of bahamut the platinum dragon  they are the ones stationed there to prevent folks from dying and the other combatants in one  corner there are five soldiers of the righteous brand one of which is gunther who are in the  process of taking large handfuls of food and eating and getting themselves some energy for  battle as soon as you enter they glance over and give a bit of a nod of notification gunther  looking straight to you grabs an apple of some kind and throws it at you eat youll need it  
none	 ashley thank you  laura whispers hes got a crush on you i can tell  marisha whispers dont let him tell you what to do  sam im in a box  laughter  laura we have a little box traveling with us  liam i drop a little bit of spell components through the box  matt it looks like amongst them there is one acting as leader or at least is in the process of  discussing tactics among the small troupe though you cant hear exactly what he is saying an elven  man with short 
none	 brown hair and these sky blue piercing eyes who is in the process of giving  orders to them then he walks off to the side pulls a blade out and begins practicing its this  very elegant almost dancelike blade technique on the opposite side of the room to them all  leaning against the wall you see five dwarves and two gnomes that are all wearing black and gold  variations to armor robes they are avoiding all social engagements and staring mad dogging  everyone else in the chamber as soon as you enter all their eyes 
none	 shift in your direction and  they watch you as you step into the chamber in the center of them you see a gray haired dwarven  women weathered skin and a surly grin as you approach gleaming these yellow teeth from  beneath who gives a bit of a squinted stare at you as you pass by you see two battleaxes resting  at the side of her belt hanging off of her armor  marisha is she her own team  matt then over by the doors snacking and looking out the window into the pit before you 
none	 you see a  group of six individuals in scuffed armor of green and brown with weathered armor and skin that shows  experience and travel markings and accessories gives you a sense of inland menagerie coast  heritage and there you see darrow who you had met earlier in the tournament whos leaning out the  window he turns around as you enter and goes ah so you did indeed decide to join not too bad  im excited to see how well you do  ashley have you been in this tournament before  matt i have not 
none	 but ive been hearing about it im excited to give it my all as you say  travis what are you going to do about the flying creatures  matt thats a good question i imagine thats less of my worry and more of theirs he points  out to the rest of the people in the stands and goes i certainly hope they have ways to deal  with that otherwise thats going to be a very unhappy day tomorrow for the people in the city  travis indeed  laura there will be a very unhappy day tomorrow

town	 matt the cheers swell and swell you hear feet slamming throughout the entire event causing dust  to come down off the ceiling above you you begin to realize that you are below some of the stands  a figure across the way emerges from another doorway from the right and the crowd goes crazy  this humanoid figure steps to the center now looking through the windows you can see this is  an open circular sand pit where there are some walllike structures in places and pillars beyond  those to break up the interior it has some 
town	 small areas for cover and these pillars in the far  corners of each side this figure who walks in is a tall halfgiant figure covered in tattoos and  spiked armor as he approaches his hands in the air as the crowds yelling and screaming  laura i hope we dont have to fight him  marisha i want to be him  matt steps out welcome all fair peoples of the great empire under our king bertrand dwendal may  his grace bless this harvests end and grant us a warm winter the crowd goes crazy i am

town	 white and gold  laura whoa  matt none of this would be possible if not for the love of you and celebration from our esteemed  starosta wyatt fedar there at the very front of that same area you see the same halfling who was  talking earlier to the page step up on a small platform to give him a little more height and  prestige amongst this point the male halfling with the curly hair and the graying sides raises  his hands and give a soft bow and the crowd explodes and cheers  marisha you 
none	 said this is the starosta right  matt this is him now we begin to bring in our fighters for this and our first competing team of  this victory pit tournament the last line all the way from bladegarden the doors open and all  the gentlemen and ladies in the righteous brand armor push past you with gunther and the elven  gentleman step out into the light now you can see the cloudy sky has broken up a bit and there  is a bit of sunlight coming down into this pit they step out into the 
none	 center as the emcee begins  to step away he goes may the first fight be a memorable one he steps back and enters a distant  door that closes behind him they all spread out and prepare across the way a door opens and you  see something shift out in chains that are then pulled off the body and the doors close behind  there you see a 12foot tall froghumanoidlike creature with a giant belly that begins to lumber  forward towards them they all immediately assault this entity jumping in the air vaulting off  sides 
town	 of the walls assaulting it one gets smacked in the face it grabs another and throws  it onto the ground another one rushes up as it grabs and slams it onto the floor and puts its weight  on top of it one foot pushing it down gunther rushes up with a blade and carves into a large  section of its face the crowd goes crazy as it pulls back and shoves gunther off with a back  fist the elven leader rushes forward and does a few quick swipes with his blade the large toad  creature 
none	 grabs it and attempts to swallow him and manages to do so completely ingests the leader  the rest begin to assault make an arcana check  liam 18  matt 18 you dont recognize the creature but theres something about this entity  sam theres just something about him  travis no nine  matt no all right this fight goes on for another minute or so you watch them trade blows  back and forth nobody falls and eventually the general carves his way from the stomach of the  beast with a giant swipe of his blade 
none	 you watch as the blood begins to pour from it as he leaps  out coated in saliva and the creatures own crimson spins around and as the large toad beast  pulls back they all together with one unified strike surround and attack it the beast lumbers  forward and falls to the ground unconscious with a rousing cheer from the audience the previous  doors open as the soldiers raise their weapons high and give a respectful bow they begin to walk  back towards the holding area as they drag the unconscious body of this creature back 
none	 to where it came  laura do we all fight the same type of creature  taliesin probably not  matt the emcee shouts again from the side with that the banderhobb has fallen  sam bander rob  matt next a last minute addition to todays tournament we bring forth traveled from  everywhere  laura thats us  matt the mighty nein  sam oh shit its us  matt the doors open again and you guys are given a straight path into the center of this field  travis yeah bring it out  laura oh my

none	 oh good  matt only one of them has a creature that emerges it seems like theyre playing mind games  with you so you dont know where its coming  travis or the other ones invisible  matt the door to this side suddenly swings open and a beast begins to lumber out chains detaching  from manacles on two of its tethered large tentaclelike arms this grayishbrown mass  probably close to 15 feet in height with a giant mouth filled with teeth and a large tongue that  lolls off the side three tendrils reach off of

none	 and all the women are right in there  matt now you are poisoned and grappled the two side tentacles and theres the one large tentacle  on top which now that you have a closer look has three vertical eyes in it that are glancing around  and looking at the space the two are wrapped around two of your allies as yashas dealing with  the poison wracking through her veins thats going to end its turn caleb youre up  liam i am very aware of how many people are in this arena especially highpowered ones as 
none	 i  wrap one hand around my forearm and i cast scorching ray even though i feel nauseous and off  they go  matt go for it because it attacked beau you could use your reaction to attack it back with  your sentinel feat  sam you have sentinel also  ashley yeah  matt they both do you have that ill let you do it now if you wanted to if you want to take it  ashley fuck yes yes  laura if you feel like attacking  matt you have disadvantage on the attack unfortunately 
none	  liam 26 ten 16  matt the first and the last one hit  ashley natural 20 13  matt 13 just misses you swing and as youre about to hit with the blade the poison pulses  through your veins and you go wide as the creature manages to be out of range how much  damage is that  liam 15 points of fire damage  matt both rays slam into it and the flames burst up and you hear pained gurgling trying to pull  back from the impact but its currently by the wall and 
none	 its holding onto your friends and  holding its ground  liam ill take a step five feet that way and as i do so i look over at fjord and just and thats  the end of my turn  travis big nope  matt that ends calebs go jester  laura oh thats me  matt yes you are currently grappled and while you are grappled you are restrained until you  break free  sam i think its my turn  matt oh sorry notts after caleb my bad thank you  sam im going to stick 
none	 my hand around and fire my little crossybowy not good not good at all  ten  matt ten goes wide as its reeling back from the blow of the flame jets from your buddy caleb  unfortunately as you fire it moves just out of the way and the bolt goes wide  sam i will reload and fire again oh god should we count that  laura yeah i think so what do you add to it  sam i dont know matt do i count that or not  laura its 18 it landed in my box

none	 it all goes to the same place you are still restrained and held in place  there anything else you want to do  laura i probably should have tried to unrestrain myself  sam youre a great player  matt no its an action to break free  laura its an action well i already did it i already tolled the dead so too late  matt end of your turn  laura i guess so  matt yasha youre up  ashley im going to attack again  taliesin theres no short rest between here and  laura 
none	 there could be  marisha no there could be more groups man  matt he said about 20 minutes between rounds and a short rest is an hour  ashley do i have advantage on attack or no  travis if you go reckless you can  ashley yes thats right i havent used reckless yet shit  matt you have not used reckless that gives you advantage on your attacks  ashley that gives me advantage but that gives them advantage on attacks  matt correct for now its a straight roll theres no disadvantage on that roll  
none	 ashley sorry guys natural 20  travis so nonchalant with that shit  matt thatll do it that doubles your weapon and the d4 you roll those together its whatever  that is its your 2d6 for your weapon d6 for your divine ability and then your die so then  double that roll those double that and then add your plus seven  ashley i see  matt ooh no  laura 17 times two is 34  taliesin plus seven  sam whoa thats a lot  ashley 41  matt how do you want to do this 
none	  cheering  ashley no way really  matt yeah you fucking murdered it  all chanting yasha  sam remember youre twice as big  matt its currently holding jester and beau and it looks like its about to slam them together  its pulling them back and their feet are dragging off the ground and causing grooves in the sand  and its growling  ashley i want to take the blade turn it down and straight into the middle of it  matt which you can do because at your full height youre about as tall as 
none	 it is in a  downward angle you thrust forward and jam it right into the center of its membrane above its  mouth as you push down you watch your blade actually protrude out the roof of its mouth  through its mouth through the tongue and into the rest of its body and as you push it gives  this horrible squealing guttural swinelike sound and as you push and push and push it  falls onto its back and you keep pushing and you keep pushing and the tentacles go limp and  release both jester and 
town	 beau at that point you pull the blade free and it is not moving on the  ground bleeding out into the sand  all whoa  laura that was amazing  marisha that was fucking awesome  laura im going to cast thaumaturgy and start whispers throughout the crowd going chanting  yasha yasha hopefully the crowd picks it up  ashley i run back into the hidden area immediately and i dont stay out there  matt okay good to know enlarge lasts for how long  liam a minute so probably the time it takes her to 
none	 cast that spell and you to run into that hole  yasha that should probably end right about magic fizzles  matt your size is reduced to a more diminutive stance as you guys back into the inside the  poison however is still holding  sam oh no can we use some medicine  laura yes ive got one kit left so im going to use my medicinal herbs on you beau to get rid of  the poison  marisha fuck yeah please  travis where are you at jester hit pointwise  laura im very low hit 
none	 pointwise im at 12 out of 31  travis you want a health potion  laura huh  travis you want a health potion  laura oh i can use my spells to heal us right now  travis i think you should save  laura the only thing i have that can get rid of poisoning is lesser restoration which i can cast  on yasha right now i can get rid of the poison on you  sam wait but the poison will go away eventually right wont it  taliesin not before the next fight i dont 
none	 think  matt you dont know  laura its probably  matt in your herbalism kit you can make antitoxin if youre in a space  laura no its not an herbalism kit its medicinal herbs which you specifically told me it  removes poison on action  matt yes its a medicine check to apply it properly but you can do that  laura oh okay  sam make that check  laura oh no  taliesin whats your medicine check  laura im proficient oh thats good  sam a lot  laura yeah its a 23  
none	 matt yeah as you guys back into the corner you manage to go ahead and apply the medicinal herbs  which are used now but the poison does manage to fade from your body beau you are no longer  poisoned youre using lesser restoration on yasha you said up to you  laura yeah ill do it  matt okay the poison is removed which is probably a good thing because it lasts until  cured  sam oh wow  matt technically its a disease that causes poison but because the nature of the herbs that  youve 
none	 utilized in this space it fits in a similar realm because its a bacterial infection  that kicks in ill say because you got to it quickly enough and you rolled so high you were  able to do that  travis because you got stabbed with poopteeth  matt kind of yeah  ashley jester what are you at right now  laura im at 12 hit points  sam you need to heal  ashley i give her a potion of healing  laura yasha you need healing too  ashley no its fine  laura are you 
town	 sure  ashley yes im sure  marisha i wont deny it but i also wont request it  travis yeah fucking take it  marisha okay  laura its what how many d4 2d4  matt 2d4 plus two for a healing potion as you guys are in the process of doing this you hear  the voice shouting out not even realizing the other group that walks outside the mountain  makers from grimgolir the dwarf and gnome troupe makes their way out into the field as the crowd  cheers the emcee vanishes and you see an 
none	 opposing side open once again immediately bursting  through you see a large ninefoot troll with elongated arms and legs start rushing into the  fray screaming this highpitched yelp as it runs you can see its skin as opposed to the deep  forest green that youve read about or seen in trolls in your experiences this looks like a dull  tealblue color you watch as the dwarves all of a sudden rush in the gnomes begin casting  spells and this assault goes back and forth you see with each strike this cold mist off the claws 
none	  of the troll with each blow you watch as the gnomes begin to apply fire upon fire and you  watch as the entity burns their intelligent knowledge of the creature causing it to prevent it  from regenerating fairly rapidly they make short work of it they were prepared and it was not as  intense a battle as you were expecting with that  travis did it look like they prepared anything with fire before the creature came out  matt to your memory you didnt know that you didnt notice anything with the final of the 
town	  battle the cheers go wild the crowd goes crazy and eventually the mountain makers make their way  back into the field anything else you guys needed to prepare at this time  marisha they had real good teamwork maybe we should come up with special moves  sam like what  taliesin like heal  sam like dont run up so close or at least wait a little bit first to gauge the beast  marisha what  sam dont run into the  youre going to die  matt out from the menagerie coast the stubborn stock 
none	  sam oh thats not us  matt behind you as the doors open they move past you darrow goes hey wish us luck friends  and enters into the sunlight  laura good luck  matt the doors close looking out past the way another door opens off to the side and you watch  as a 15footlong crocodile becomes barreling into the center its jaws opening and snapping as it  comes rushing in it climbs over the wall that the guys are getting behind to defend and immediately  snaps down on one of the soldiers who 
none	 gets hit in the side and screams out in pain they all begin  to rush in and assault jumping off the wall and getting onto its back you watch as darrow climbs  up onto it taking a shortsword that one of his friends had dropped and jams it into the top of  the head as he pulls out his battleaxe he begins to hack away he seems to be laughing another friend pries  the mouth off of the one soldier that had been stamped on he limps away as it spins around its  tail slapping 
none	 one of its friends sending him flying back ten feet as his weapon goes skidding  into the sky it hits the dirt off the way he runs to try and retrieve it the battle goes back  and forth for a while one of their friends goes down and one of his allies grabs and pulls him  away from the battle zone as he begins to try and wake him up at this point you watch as darrow  makes a couple of motions to his friends and they all cycle in and assault at one time cutting 
town	 at  the throat of the large crocodile as darrow takes his axe and carves out one of its eyes as it  pulls back screaming in pain they both come underneath and cut through the throat at the same  time causing it to bleed out with that the crocodile collapses not moving into the field  marisha did you see that he had a sign and then things happened  matt they slap awake their ally and they begin to drag themselves back into the chamber as the  crowds cheering theyre a little wounded and a little 
none	 winded but as they come in heh that  wasnt too bad youre on deck i suppose they bring their friend over to the side and one  travis they used cover really well we should try and hide ourselves better  sam i can make a box  taliesin no dont do that  sam i can actually make a 15 foot large box we could all fit in it  laura im going to take a healing potion  travis nott had a great idea actually though we should keep our distance  sam keep our distance we 
none	 dont know what door theyre coming out  travis we dont  sam did we see which door the last two monsters came out of  matt the one that came out here the crocodile came out here  sam that was the last one  matt that was the last one  ashley what about the teal thing what was the who did the mountain makers fight  matt oh the ice troll sorry the ice troll came from this side there they are changing  ashley theyre changing  travis you people that need to be up close 
none	 just wait until it gets to you make him chase you for  a bit use the cover lets put some damage on it before  marisha i could do that i could be a distraction  matt to the front lines again the last line you see as the armored soldiers go back out there  into the field they get into the center they form a phalanx back to back in the center as they  look around in any direction and you hear grunting roaring and two gates open from each  gate two largelooking figures come 
dung	 charging out you see these sprinting dark humanoid creatures  with giant horns out of the front of their head two minotaurs come charging into the center  immediately they both break into two groups and try to head them off shields up one of them gets  thrown taking the impact of the blow knocked back onto his ass three feet back the other one  gets gored immediately the horns piercing his armor and throwing him into the air as this  happens you notice now theyre both wielding large axes and they start cleaving into the  
none	 opponents theyre giving up a good fight and it goes back and forth for a bit but at one point  you watch one drop and another drop a third one gets grabbed and picked up and then broken over  the knee of one of the minotaurs at which point you see the elven general begins to look around  nervously and starts waving his hand to call it off just as one of them gores him from behind he  gets thrown ten feet landing onto the ground rolling unconscious his blade clattering in the  dirt there 
none	 you see gunther in the center with two warhammers in his hands blood down his face  going come on they both come charging in at him from two different sides last minute he  darts backward causing them to collide into each other as theyre stunned he rushes up and jams  his hammer into the head of one of them once twice one of the minotaurs goes down and right  as he pulls back the second minotaur gets him from behind you watch as a horn pierce where his  liver is and he falls unconscious on 
town	 the ground they fall the final minotaur roars up into the  air and the whole crowd goes oh you watch as two groups come out with chains and manacles and  manage to grapple and throw them down the lasting minotaur passes out in the chains and they drag  him back off the field the two clerics rush out into the field and prevent death to those who are  in the process of slipping with that the last line is pulled back the first fallen out here in  the field  laura that was intense would 
none	 we be able to have fought those two minotaurs  marisha and taliesin i dont know  sam no of course not  matt the first fallen in the tournament  taliesin focus on one target at a time  matt let us greet back to the field the mighty nein the doors open once more  marisha shes cure woundsing me  matt all righty where do you guys wish to be placed  laura is it possible to climb up on one of the walls  matt if youd like to try  laura im going to try

none	 rushing towards it it opens its jaws to strike you slide down and with one  scimitar you jam up into its lower jaw which causes its upper jaw to be stuck and as you pull  it out its jaw falls open as it does your other blade you backswing dropping not dropping but  holding on with both hands on the other side swing through and as it carves in you actually  get about one to two feet inward as the jaw lolls open the tongue slips out as you cut it from the  inside of 
town	 the mouth its eyes go dull as the creatures body collapses to the ground no longer moving  ashley fucking yes  matt with that point the whole crowd goes cheering  travis yasha yasha  all yasha yasha  matt the gates where you came open and you all go and return  laura the minute that it ends im going to start casting prayer of healing  matt okay as you guys step into the back chamber you cast prayer of healing  laura yeah who all is injured right now  ashley im pretty bad  laura

none	 great  laura thats decent 14 points to everyone  sam oh thats great thats huge wow healer  matt all righty  sam i think laura is the best healer weve ever had  laughter  matt as you guys pull back into your chamber theres a few nods darrows clapping and the rest  of his team are clapping theres a clap from two of the mountain makers off to the side at which  point the mountain makers are announced and they step out into the space as they all gather  hiding in the corner spreading 
dung	 out a bit two of the sides open out of one two large furred  entities about eight to nine feet tall come rushing in with a combination of fur and feathers  these hooked dark beaks at the tips of their mouths two owlbears come running in and go into  an assault on these people they took some hits in the last battle and as it goes back and forth  you watch as theyre striking it and cutting through the owlbears are screaming this horrible  squeal of pain and anguish combined with ravenous anger and they 
none	 start tearing and pulling into  them one of them grabs the gnome in its beak pulls up and tears its throat out the gnome  gurgles as it falls to the ground the two clerics immediately come up to the side getting ready to  rush out there to try and save its life another one of them manages to hit one of the owlbears in  its leg as it falls on the ground and they all start slashing on it it looks like one owlbear is  about to fall as the other one in a complete 
none	 frenzy either partnered or what tears and grabs  one of the dwarves and starts biting into its face as it screams it falls unconscious on the ground  it grabs another and bites into its chest throwing it into the sky as they spin off to the  side as they all begin to pick up to assault the one thats going after them the one on the ground  slowly gets back up and joins the fray you watch one by one as these owlbears on the cusp of  dying tear through the mountain makers  at 
town	 which point the crowd goes like gasp whoa big cheers cheers because its a display but  also that mournful whoa that low bassy sound at which point you see the two groups come out  again with the chains and the come up to the outskirts of the owlbears which then pass out and  they put the manacles on and then pull them away  travis they pass out when the manacles go on  matt right as they get up to them they pass out they pull them off and drag them the gates open  wipe 
none	 the clerics rush out and grab and drag in the bodies the gnome is gone but one of the  clerics reaches over and touches him and for a moment later gasps breath comes back and you  watch the wound close up somewhat brought from death as they pull the group in  laura i need to learn that  matt the shout comes for the next group the stubborn stock returns and darrow and his team  rush out giving a pat on the shoulder to yasha on the rush out they go out to the middle field 
dung	 the  gates close and there two of the gates open on the sides and you see these dark shapes kind of  materialization noise  sam oh no  matt almost skittering but shifting their position seems hard to map at which point you see  darrow glance on the side and he goes oh no i know what this is you watch as these large  pantherlike creatures with large tendrils off their back whipping begin rushing inward  marisha shouting displacer beasts  matt one of them swings and strikes but as he strikes it passes through 
none	 and it all of a sudden  shifts and was not in the space where it blow and it pounces onto one of his adventurers they begin  to hack back and forth crowding up around each other back to back one of them is pulling out his  longbow and letting loose arrow after arrow some striking some missing one of them all of a  sudden the phase is lost it gets struck and now it is in a solid place they use that moment for  all of them to dash in and surround this one creature 
none	 they manage to within one round carve  down this one displacer beast on one side the other pouncing onto darrow and holding him to the  ground its back legs clawing into his belly as the others try and pull it off darrow takes a  serious series of wounds before he manages to pull himself free the displacer beast grabs another of  its friends and snaps him in his face he falls unconscious and whips around they strike at it a  few times but they cant seem to find where its body is it is dodging 
town	 around until finally darrow  is back up his face covered in blood takes his battle axe and swings wide and clocks it in the  side of the jaw its strange illusion form vanishes at that point its body coming to a very  condensed location they all swarm this one and one by one tear it down for the next round  theyre hurt their bruised and darrows looking rough but with that the stubborn stock raise  their hands the stubborn stock continues and the crowd cheers  laura i was hoping they would lose  matt 
none	 as they pull back in the mc walks back out two rounds completed and only two teams remain  for the third and final round will they all fall will they all survive we shall see as next we  call forth the mighty nein any preparation you guys have in this moment as the doors begin to open  sam everyone  travis im tapped  sam wait  marisha im so tapped  sam wait what if we just stood next to all the doors and held our action until something came out  of them  taliesin
