adventure now we have the pleasure of  bringing it on the stream for you to watch enjoy and occasionally interact with before we  get to that to give you a little backstory on the characters youll be seeing this evening were  going to play some videos for you in a second do /none/ note for all you hardcore gamers out there a lot  of this is houseruled looseygoosey having a good time so all you number crunchers stop  paying attention there just have fun with it nevertheless we have some background story on  many of the characters youll be seeing this evening to help you jump into the story lets go  ahead and enjoy those in a minute then well introduce the players so have fun  travis right listen up if you have ale then you have a friend in grog strongjaw a goliath of  towering height /none/ and size this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life  combat women and ale  record scratch  travis wait easily the brains of the group grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of  shapes colors and shiny things also ale in his early years armed with his twohanded greataxe  grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his familys wandering herd but after  coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods he objected to the killing of such an innocent  life a creature of impulse /none/ grog felt only pity for this well this terrified little thing and  his disobedience cost him dearly beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader his uncle kevdak  grog was abandoned and left to die exiled from his herd it was then that the relative of the  very gnome he fought to save saved him it was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike that  healed grog bringing him back from deaths edge and they have remained close friends ever since  most nights grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches or /none/ accompanying  scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors also ale  marisha a first impression of keyleth would leave you with little information on the halfelven  druid you might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is  kind of sweet of course it would be unwise underestimate her based on first impressions  thunder crack  marisha under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose  natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants literally born to the  /none/ air tribe of the ashari people keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental  magics it is her peoples inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in taldorei where the  four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm since she was a little girl she had quite  a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities well if you consider kittens and  flying squirrels to be little beasts which i do anyways it wasnt long before the headmaster of  the tribe her father korren realized her true prodigious abilities and /none/ she was inveterated to  succeed him as the next headmaster just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and  replaced with endless spell memorization teachings from ancient traditions and exceedingly  high expectations every druid leadertobe must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in  order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters they call this the  aramente or noble odyssey when her father felt she was ready he set her on the path to truly  discovering herself not knowing when or if she will ever return as she hiked /none/ down the mountain  towards stilben she meditated on the task ahead part of the aramente is proving yourself a strong  warrior a valiant protector and a wise and compassionate leader with this knowledge one  thought plays in repeat in her mind is she even worthy  taliesin percy was the third child of seven children born to a noble family who lived far to  the north in the ancient castle of whitestone with so many siblings to share the burdens of  lordship percy turned his attention to the sciences engineering and naturalism one day a /dung/  mysterious couple named lord and lady briarwood came to court during a feast held in their honor  the briarwoods violently took control of the castle killing or imprisoning everyone who would  stand in their way percy awoke chained in the dungeon only to be freed by his younger sister  together they fled chased by the briarwoods men as they ran percys sister took several arrows to  the chest and fell percy kept running eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating  unconscious to freedom he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat /none/ he barely remembered the  next two years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible then one night percy had a  dream a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family  when he awoke percy began to design his first gun  sam oh you havent heard of scanlan shorthalt well gird your loins ladies because he has his  eye on you a talented musician master of disguise and dashingly handsome in his own mind  scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises /town/ born a poor gnome scanlan used his  endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother one day he  was discovered by a halforc promoter and joined dr dranzels spectacular traveling troupe where  he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire a loner much of  his life scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands  of a goblin invasion while his years on the road provided many shall we say educational  experiences /town/ with the opposite sex deep down scanlan yearns for the one thing hes never known  the true love of a fellow gnome still scanlan considers himself a lover first performer second  and fighter distant third on the battlefield hell support his allies but rarely draws blood  unless its to protect fellow gnome pike count on scanlan for a hearty laugh a rollicking song  and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon  orion greetings and salutations i am tiberius stormwind i hail from a town called tyrex  located in /none/ the heart of draconia born from a politically respected family at the age of 15 i  succeeded in passing the sorcerers rite showing prodigylike control of my magic the judges and  the draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long i had been  training at 20 years old i was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in draconian  history for the next few years i almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member as its  rather boring however one day i happened upon a /none/ chamber unused for quite some time in the room  were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world for  months i would frequent the chamber and learned of artifacts from legend after a long period of  research i made a list of artifacts that caught my eye i brought these findings to the high  council and was told that all of the information in the chamber i had stumbled upon was either  believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries and hence were lost forever i found those answers /town/  to be unacceptable a year later i devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend  support in me leaving draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms  going from town to town and making friends and allies in and for the name of draconia being a  red dragonborn i had quite the task on my hands in that respect but it was exactly what i needed  so i could explore the world and find these artifacts as i felt the truth was out there some  may /none/ describe me as buffoonish but i say poppycock to all that i am much sharper than most give me  credit for i just dont pay attention to things sometimes ive also been known to be rather  cunning loyal happygolucky and well dangerous i cant help but show my true scales  every now and then but overall i think im quite friendly for a dragonborn  liam never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men vaxildan learned at a young age to  skip past formality preferring instead to invite himself in your door along with /town/ twin sister  vexahlia vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry raised  by their mother in their early years the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the  elven capital of syngorn but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed and their time  in the capital didnt last the siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open  road after a few years of wandering they eventually decided to return to their mother and  journeyed back to the lands of their youth /none/ but instead of finding their childhood home they  returned to a pile of rubble their mother was gone their home burned to ash pressing the  townspeople for answers they learned of the day the dragon came with their ties all severed  vaxildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in taldorei an outsider since  birth vax quickly learned to solve lifes challenges in his own particular way often by  sidestepping them entirely and when his knack for circumventing adversity isnt enough the way of  blades the elves schooled him in more /none/ than makes up the difference  laura like so many halfelves vexahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool  reception of a people who dont fully accept her born of a human mother and an elven father who  only later in life took an interest in their existence vexahlia and her twin brother  vaxildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other  it was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in syngorn  the isolated /none/ elven city for which their father was an ambassador he quietly took them in but always  kept an icy distance and after too many years of disdainful looks the pair decided to leave his  indifference behind and set out on their own vax took to the cities stealing small trinkets and  learning the ways of the thief while vex kept to the woods she preferred the isolation always the  keen observer she learned to hunt and to track to spy and to shoot through a series of fateful  events earned herself a companion in the /none/ form of a bear her own stolen trinket to fight  alongside her and protect her fiercely also he is adorable and gives expert massages like so  many halfelves  matt hey guys welcome back to give you a little heads up we are playing the 5th edition of  dungeons  dragons we recently converted over from pathfinder for those who play pathfinder  one of our players was a gunslinger for which there are no rules for in 5th edition so i had to  create and customize those for the game so bear with us on /none/ that that will be an interesting ride  regardless we do have an eightplayer game weve been playing for two years which is a little  crazy which is why we go a little loose with the rules its a great group its a lot of fun not  everyone can make every game so we have enough players to definitely pull a party each time  zac

city of emon one of the central capitals  of this human civilization of taldorei they managed to halt a demonic insurrection within the  throne and as such were greeted to a heros celebration and had a keep built in their honor  over the six month period of the keep being constructed they went their own ways and /none/ then  returned to see its final creation however they did not have a chance to really enjoy it  immediately as one of their good friends and allies arcanist allura vysoren of the taldorei  council came to them requesting their aid saying that a long time friend of hers lady kima of  vord who is a very well known and very well respected halfling paladin of bahamut the  platinum dragon had been gone on a pilgrimage for a while essentially a vision quest that is part  of her own development as a paladin as part /dung/ of this she let the information go to allura that a  dark vision had come to her saying that some sort of evil root is beginning to breed beneath  kraghammer and the mountains within kraghammer which is the nearby dwarven civilization that you  guys have previously not been allowed entry to because the dwarves werent fans of nobody without  any political means of entry however she managed to acquire the necessary documentation and offered  you a very substantial reward should you find the whereabouts of lady kima of vord and hopefully  bring her back /none/ safely you left on the pathway to the dwarven citadel of kraghammer you were  ambushed by a group of roaming barbarian goliaths part way through the battle grog managed to  recognize one of them as a previous ally and no longer an ally at this time  travis son of a bitch  matt yep the barbarian for his first and only time so far managed to avert battle through a  social encounter and rolled pretty damn well on a persuasion check so you got one you get one you  got your one never again  /none/ travis next time he dies  matt yeah essentially which managed to not turn it into complete bloodshed you continued on your  way to kraghammer presented your paperwork were given entry into the city and that is where we  begin this adventure  laura oh no  sam in the city of kraghammer  matt in the city of kraghammer  sam wow this is fantastic  travis were in right  marisha yes we were at the door we were talking to someone right  matt yeah you were talking to the front guards at the gate /dung/ of kraghammer they have begrudgingly  let you inside giving you a couple of pointers little prods and sent you into the city proper  you made your way through the darkened alleyways and stone carved tunnel that leads into the main  central portion of the city proper an enormous underground metropolis sprawls out before you the  dark earth and shadows creating beautiful stone work marble columns archways and labyrinthine  bridges climbing across the vertical cityscape all warmed with the red glow of some strange  crimson rock peppered throughout the town as a light source a /none/ large metal forge envelops the  center of this cylindrical city the entire is a threetiered cylindrical city that is built into  the ground of the mountain itself welcome to kraghammer  liam remind us did we bullshit our way in here or did  laura no we had a way in  matt no allura got your paperwork so you were actually able to get in this time  laura but ashley speaks dwarvish pike speaks  matt pike speaks dwarvish and shes not here  orion i speak dwarvish as well  laura oh good  orion /dung/ i do  sam thats fantastic  matt the only other bit of information you have about the whereabouts of her is that she came here  to go into the mine apparently a mithral mine where this evil is supposedly brewing you heard  that the one person who owns the biggest part of the mithral market here cornering his name was the  dwarven lord nostoc greyspine that was the only name you had in regards to this deep earth quarry  sam greyspine  matt greyspine correct  sam we have to go find him dont we /none/  taliesin i think before we do anything we should find a place to sleep  orion thats true  travis oh were all jacked up from before right  taliesin wouldnt it be nice to put everything down for a little while  sam of course ive got a lot of booty that i need to stow  orion good way to phrase that scanlan also i would like to check out any places where they  might have enchanted libraries or what not  sam can you stick with us youre the only one that speaks dwarvish  /dung/ liam yes youre getting ahead of yourself  orion im just saying put it on the list  liam lets look around are there any dwarves in the vicinity  matt oh there are many as you finish this conversation you look about there are two guards  posted nearby wearing dark crimson and brass chest plates that have a uniform scar carved across the  front its actually built into the armor itself as a design theyre both staring awkwardly at all  of you arguing in the middle of this entry thoroughfare of kraghammer  liam tiberius make /town/ with the dwarftalk please  orion hello friends my associates and i were looking for a place of lodging for the night and a  place of reputable reputation  matt one dwarf shouts over to another one you hear that jepson theyre looking for a place to  stay aye i heard that right its about time we had some new folk in town well if youre  looking for a place to stay id say your best bet would be the pig pits  sam is that the name of a place  matt yes certainly the pig /none/ pits  sam all right  matt ask for the pig pits  laura those are actually pig pits isnt it  marisha i feel like were being hazed  matt what no not at all  travis that sounds fine with me  liam this is common  matt this is all in common yeah  sam which way to the pig pits sir  matt pig pits are that way he points over the edge and you see down past the central forge  structure in the city to the very bottom nearby a large temple that envelops /tavern/ the bottom floor of  kraghammer proper there is indeed a distant slop of mud where internal livestock are being kept  laura i bring out a piece of gold please sir were looking for a place to stay that isnt  covered in mud  matt its good to see that at least one of you speaks dwarvish takes the coin kinks it in his  teeth and goes all right now if youre looking for a proper place to stay youre going to look  for the iron hearth tavern that is to your left up that way /tavern/ no more than a half mile keep an eye  out listen for the laughter and the people who are very drunk thats your best bet  laura thank you sir  matt no worries  laura i like your armor by the way  matt well thank you kindly  travis was that a wink  laura it was  liam thats all she does  laura thats all i do is wink at people  liam its a nervous tic really  matt its a feat she took you progress to the western side of the kraghammer rotation /tavern/ as you  curl around the central platform making your way eventually to the outside of this rather large  central tavern inn as you walk in you can hear music playing you can hear laughter and boastful  cheer you can hear some arguments in the distance you can hear it from a good two or three  buildings away this is definitely a central social environment here in kraghammer as you walk  inside you let me get some proper tavern music here for you  sam smells in here  travis drinking territory  matt you hear /tavern/ some loud boisterous hearty dwarven laughter some drinks being clinked  together as you walk in the first thing that catches you is the scent of stale alcohol and  smoked wood of some kind  travis yes  matt there are tables most of them in decent condition some of them halfbroken and repaired  probably from some previous encounter in the bar in the center of the room there looks to be a not  currently in use specifically built brawling circle its about 30 feet by 20 feet its more  of an oval its not in /tavern/ use currently  sam an octagon  matt essentially  liam how high is the ceiling here can grog fit in here  travis oh right am i like  matt the ceiling actually is considered vaulted ceiling for dwarves so it runs at about seven  feet for grog its uncomfortable almost scratching your head across the top as you enter  about seven or eight of the nearby dwarves at the front door go hearty laughter they look  immediately at the ragtag nondwarven group that just stumbled into the center of the tavern  travis whatre you /none/ looking at  matt its not very often we get someone with that kind of a mug on you let me buy you a drink come  sit down  travis my kind of people see you later i go grab the drink with the lovely dwarves  laura we grab a table next to the dwarves with grog  matt both tables next to the table theyre at are completely filled with dwarves  liam i take a sack of gold out of my own pocket slam it down on the table  laura a sack of gold are /none/ you crazy  liam gentlemens and ladies ladies and gentlemen we are traveling from far away we just arrived  from emon we are fascinated to see your underground city and to celebrate the occasion i  would like to buy every dwarf in here a round bartender  matt the music stops the conversation stops all dwarven eyes turn to the table and they all turn  to a single dwarven woman in the back whos behind one of the bars who has a towel over one arm  shes looking around shes staring confused at you and all /none/ eyes are on her and she goes well  its about time someone around here had some generosity certainly pay upfront drinks all  around on this halfelven gentleman  liam let it rain  cheering  marisha make it rain  travis i would like a cask of ale  liam ill need your largest bowl of ale for this one here  travis cask cask of ale cask  matt no worries adras got your back be right back she wanders off to the back room comes  back and starts pouring stein after stein after stein of /tavern/ ale  travis yeah keep going looks good  matt you do notice she is definitely the head of this tavern and all of her barkeeps are male and  seem to be worked rather ragged  laura what was her name  sam excuse me miss you  matt adra yeah  sam im sorry  matt adra  sam adra you run a fantastic establishment  matt thats right i do  sam thank you for welcoming us and allowing us to buy this round  matt of course patrons that come and drop coin like that are /tavern/ welcome any time  sam well thank you for your hospitality might we inquire about staying here the night do you  have an inn with the establishment  matt she reaches below and pulls out a big tome and starts thumbing through it you know  actually we have openings right now on the second floor  sam several rooms or just one  matt do you need them side by side  sam that would be nice  matt we could pull him there and push him into room seven  sam something with a little bed for /none/ me  matt giles one of the dwarf barmaiders comes over aye get stepheson out of his room move  him to the third floor we have to open a block for our new guests ugh fine the older dwarf  stumbles his way up the stairs begrudgingly right so i can get a room for each of you were  looking at eight rooms separately that will run you per evening about 25 gold pieces does that  sound about right  travis total  matt 25 total pieces  sam oh okay  laura you want to share /none/ a room  marisha yeah well bunk up  sam grog you and me i can sleep on your feet  laura probably like 15 gold then for just that amount  matt she visibly deflates a little bit and is like all right fair enough five rooms it is  15 gold per room  sam were penny pinchers  matt how long do you expect to stay  orion at least a few days  sam id say a week  taliesin with an indefinite hold we have business in the city  matt right well how bout /none/ we pay the week in advance and ill give you a discount  laura whats the discount  marisha wait i thought we were going to be heading south  matt lets say 100 gold for the week all five rooms  liam were pretty flush i think we can handle it  laura yes that works  taliesin this doesnt terrify me  laura i think i did the math wrong  travis i was told there would be no math  sam sounds good  laura gah i hate not having a calculator fine  matt ah great /none/ she pulls back and pulls some keys out and hands them to the rest of you hands  you some paperwork shows you which rooms are yours and says youre welcome to stay all you  like ask questions hang about just make sure you dont do anything stupid near the carvers  orion ooh like what i do things like that all the time  liam sorry our dwarvish is a little thick near the  matt the carvers the carvers  laura the carvas of course  matt the carvers  orion the converse of course  sam /none/ the car verse  matt is this your first time in kraghammer  all yes  matt the carvers are the guard that run this city theyre the ones that keep the law  laura the scar  matt yes the armor the carvers  travis yeah what is with the scar ive got one myself  matt she leans back and as you reveal the rather gnarled scar on your chest she reels back a bit  and two of the nearby dwarves go yeah they chug down their drinks  travis yeah more drinking  matt they start /none/ showing their scars and are like oh no i got this one from an iron bolt they  start talking about different creatures they fought all right well the carvers are a bit of  a how do i put it a military class in this city they run a very tight ship on the streets  so be careful  taliesin that shouldnt be a problem mostly we are looking for lord greyspine if i recall we  have business with him  laura we might have business with you if youve seen a halfling come through  matt /tavern/ she thinks to herself and goes there was a halfling woman but she was staying at the  firebrook inn  laura the firebrook  matt the bottom floor for a couple of weeks there was talk about her she got in a few fights  herself the one with the silver armor that one yeah she was a firebrand if ever i saw one right  up my alley i like that one  taliesin how long ago would you say this was  matt oh she went through a few weeks i havent seen her recently  taliesin /tavern/ thank you perfect  travis is there a champion of the circle of fighting in the tavern is there a reigning  sam already grog  travis well i have to know these things  taliesin he has to do something  matt she turns the barrel that she has on the table towards you a little bit and you can see the  actual symbol  this burned image on the side that says balgus brewery she goes thatll be balgus the one  that supplies us with what youre drinking hes the undefeated champion but i dont think /tavern/ hes  quite right to fight at the moment she points towards the very edge of the bar and you see one  older grizzled dwarf long gray hair pulled into straight braids in the back big bushy beard  thats all shoved up into his face because hes asleep drunk as a skunk on the edge of the bar  travis my type of dwarf maybe well can use him as a merc later or something all right another  time then  sam another time  liam save it for a rainy day  travis does it rain /none/ down here  taliesin i dont think they have rainy days  matt you said greyspine  laura yes greyspine  taliesin we are looking to set up a meeting  matt which greyspine  sam nostoc  matt nostoc greyspine hes definitely a business type one  orion well whos the friendlier greypsine  matt the friendlier of the types would probably be the head of house greyspine  marisha wait how many greypsines are there  matt oh well theres probably several at this point ive lost track the family lines been  going for a while however /none/ of house greyspine currently ironkeeper gradim greyspine is the head  of this entire city voted in ten years ago actually hes head of the council  marisha ironkeeper what  matt ironkeeper gradim greypsine gradim youre sigh these commoners learn to speak  the language  orion i understood  liam adra may i ask obviously we have no dwarves in our little party  matt unfortunately  laura unfortunately for us  liam sorry about that youre very welcoming we appreciate that how welcoming would you say the  city is to outsiders would we stick out like /dung/ a sore thumb  matt probably as long as you dont do anything stupid as long as you keep the coin flowing and  as long as you stay to the upper levels the lower levels you get to more of the business the  miners the forges the foundries when you get to the business areas thats where the guard gets  heavier and thats where folks dont like you poking near their money  sam so the lower levels would have the mithral mines  matt the mithral mine aye  sam theres one  matt there is /none/ one now its all been and has been for quite some time completely helmed up and  run by house greypsine the keystone quarry is what youre looking for  liam were not really interested in that we just want to see the city our business is elsewhere  matt yeah i would not recommend it not without proper business credentials on that youll end up  being questioned very heavily  liam sounds like a dirty business anyway  laura right  travis yeah you want to stay away from those miners scanlan thats a dirty business  matt /none/ she gives you a look almost like it was a slightly racist statement but then passes it off  because you paid her a lot of coin today  marisha so racist  laura so nostock nostoc  liam nostoc  laura nostoc greyspine  matt yes  laura you said that hes kind of a  matt oh theres a reason hes the one put in charge of the mines and the businesses and the foundries  laura oh where is he located exactly  matt well if hes not home at the actual greyspine manor which is a /dung/ sprawling house it  contains all the ones who live there  travis were going there  matt hes probably down at the actual what is it pardon bear with me consult my notes hes  probably down by the greyspine quarry itself keeping an eye on the business there theres a  nearby dwarf having a few drinks goes ah greyspine theres been troubles round there  apparently a friend of mine works there got a big nasty scar last week wouldnt even pay him  for his time off to heal its bullshit he slams his drink down /none/ on the table  sam down at the quarry  matt aye  marisha how did your friend get this nasty cut  matt he works there said there was things pouring out of the caves goblins and the like  laura and sam goblins  matt ah goblins are nothing  laura of course not  matt seems theres something other than goblins poking out through this hole just saying that  business is in for a serious problem if it doesnt change  laura does your friend ever have drinks here no hes been sober for two years /town/ were not  friends anymore tugs on his beard a little bit  marisha oh im sorry i think  sam a lot to process  matt he pours another drink at which point adra slaps his hand and says pay that he bought one round  he finishes his drink and walks away  orion excuse me one thing adra are there any mystics in this particular town that study any  arcane arts  matt of course what you think dwarves are just the baseline folks who brawl each other  marisha so many racist comments jeez  /none/ matt what youre looking for is house thunderbrand they are the ones who by blood  have the arcane arts in their family line  orion interesting  matt they run most of the enchantment process in the city they also train they call it train  some of us call it more indoctrination but theyre definitely the focus of all arcane arts  here in kraghammer  orion thank you  sam thank you for your time adra carry on with your evening well seek you out if we have any  more questions  matt certainly now if /none/ you dont mind she scoots you aside and you see a line a queue of  dwarves behind her with their empty cups waiting to get to her to fill up the drinks that you bought  marisha oh thats we did promise that  liam enjoy gentlemen and lady  laura what time of day is it  matt best that you can tell inside you cant you just arrived probably around 300 or 400 in  the afternoon so youre probably pushing sunset

it youre the first one  liam first die rolling nice  laura 18 plus what is that investigation or insight  matt this would be a straight intelligence roll on this one so your general knowledge of dwarves  laura oh 20 then  matt 20 thats not too bad in your experience you know dwarves depending on their lifestyle and  what they do for a living their clocks can run differently but /tavern/ for the most part they run in  tandem with most other races just because it makes it easier for dealing with outside forces but  like i said its very variable there is no set locked time of this is morning this is evening  they just sleep when they need to and wake up when they need to  laura all right good to know  marisha its like living in alaska  laura right  matt and marisha dwarven alaska  sam yes fellows what should we do  laura check out the firebrook inn yes that /none/ was where lady kima was staying also i think  somebody should run reconnaissance on greyspine manor  travis like stealth you mean  liam yes i dont think we should try to go directly to the mines and find nostoc  laura no  sam agreed  liam no i think maybe we should enlist the help of a dwarf here in the city to introduce us to  nostoc i mean were not trying to raise hell or bring down a thousand dwarves upon us  taliesin theres no sense attempting to be subtle  sam although that /tavern/ does sound fun  taliesin everyones going to know that were here and what were looking for by morning  travis why dont we get old drunky greybeard thats got his face down on the bar to do it  laura yeah but hes very well lets ask him maybe hes drunk enough to help us saddle up grog  travis me  laura people seem to like you here  travis yeah but im really oh thats true  liam youre the connoisseur  travis maybe ill

little tune that saunters through the airthe magical energies  emanate from the notes you make drift into his torso you can see a slight glow and he  grumbling wheres that blasted music coming from his /town/ hand goes out and paws towards the flute  sam huh i dont know where that was coming from  travis im sorry to disturb you your name is of great repute around these parts  matt he wipes a globule of drool thats crusted into his beard aye youve bothered me nap what  do you want from balgus  travis we were wondering if we might perchance acquire your knowledge about town for a bit of a search  laura whispered talk to him about fighting first  travis right i hear youre a good fighter you look /tavern/ strong  matt ive heard the same  travis right how often do you get challengers in this tavern  matt not as often as i get woken up from my sleep which is never because only stupid people  do that  laura lost cause abandon ship  travis right i have an intelligence of six i know what

travis look at that one 19  laura woo  matt 19 he /none/ takes a moment and grabs the drink that you prepared from his hand and goes gulps  travis nice form  matt youve got five minutes then he stretches his back a bit this gnarled hunch that he holds  in his physical posture flexes it a bit and now you can see the rippling muscles that show beneath  his tunic this is a built dwarf you dont know what past hes had moving boulders or forging  crazy iron shit but theres a reason this guy has a reputation he stands up off of his stool which  /none/ you can now hear crack with the weight of a dwarf which are made for normal dwarves this guy is  solid muscle he saunters over looks about for a second almost like hes looking for his next  target sees the pointy ears sees the pointy ears and goes sighs and saunters up to the  table slams his hand down  marisha why is he coming towards us  travis because i told him to because youre supposed to ask him  sam boobs  liam steady as she goes

added to ale or wine and makes it  quite sensational  matt he takes the sealed cup and sloshes it around in his hand the actual liquid is  coagulated to such a point that its less of /none/ a blood and more of a gelatin sloshing sounds  travis it gets better with age  laura exactly a spoon of it  matt he peeks it open and sniffs yes  laura i think thats really expensive actually  matt i can have this appraised but if you want to do a straight trade for the barrel for this  ill take you up on that  laura shit no  sam just go for it  laura all right fine one cup of it  matt all right he takes

spiralling vein of the marble  its gold the gate outside is wrought iron black iron thats topped with a series of pikes and  pike awkwardly looks sickened not understanding the real key point is if

a low gentle glow of the entire city is now clustered into these street lamps that are  throughout the entire location you begin to press into the residential district proper theres some  nice homes that are carved into the side of the rock theres some standalone homes that are  built out of fine stone you eventually make your way towards the nicer part of it where you start  seeing some of /town/ the more marble buildings some of the more exotic stonework being used in the  construction of the homes you also notice three of the guards that are part of the city  establishment there are following you from behind curiously the carvers  laura oh shit the carvers shit  matt no weapons drawn but definitely hands at the ready  laura and liam okay  liam well we could just keep walking

persuasion roll  sam oh jesus  travis oh god  matt either of you whichever you prefer  sam if only i was there  laura 21  matt all right  travis wow pretty decent good for you  matt the guards look at each other the one that was talking to you you can see now as he comes a  little closer into the light a frazzled black beard thats pulled into a very tight braid that  goes down to his bellybutton all /none/ wearing the same basic chest plate long black velvet cloak  behind each carrying some sort of heavy warhammer around the side of their belt steps up and says  well just to tell you the rules here if youre going to wander at night in a very expensive  district you dont want to do it by yourself because you either have chances of being mugged or  arrested we might have arrested you  laura oh no im so sorry well do we need protection  matt one of them looks over and sees the bear that is /none/ off in the shadows nearby  laura i thought trinket stayed behind cool cool  matt

tavern that were staying at i was /town/ wondering if maybe you  could show me around the rest of the town  matt he looks to the other guards and theyre obviously fed up with his flirting and theyre  not too keen on you guys well you guys hold up post ill give her a quick walk around  laura thank you so much  matt all right but im going to tell the boss fine i dont get this chance very often  liam i wave off from the alley that i snuck in to  laura yeah go do your shit  liam you /none/ do your shit that you do then i head back through the shadows  laura whoosh damn it  matt you ask around and it takes a while especially since as a dragonborn some folks are  like oh im not talking to you some others are like oh yeah right over that way its a  completely wrong direction so it takes you a good two hours to eventually find your way to house  thunderbrand when you get there its a beautiful alabaster building large white dome with small  spires built in to one of the more /none/ elevated ceilings of kraghammer proper on the outside  there is no gate just an open lawn you see grass you see normally outside flora and fauna  currently adorning the scape around this structure  orion whoa well this is a lovely sight im going to saunter on up to the door  matt nice go ahead and make a perception check  orion where is my perception oh five  matt five you saunter right up to the edge of the grass line and get one step on what suddenly  becomes visible to you a rather subtly /none/ carved dwarven rune in the ground in fact theres a  bunch of them outlining the entirety of the grass as your foot hits the rune youre like  oh thats a dwarven rune stomping  sam thats a good voice  matt as tiberius ive been practicing my tiberius  orion its close  matt go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw  travis uhoh saving throw  laura you got it tiberius  orion what is this  marisha dexterity  orion oh thats a 15  matt 15  orion mmhmm  matt you manage to /none/ pull back to lessen the impact but a bolt of bluish energy bursts out  from the rune in front of you throwing you about three or four feet behind the rune you catch  yourself you do suffer eight points of thunder damage  orion okay  marisha damn gated communities  sam this is why we go to brothels instead of sneaking around at night  travis yep no lightning attacks  matt its a whole different kind of damage you can suffer  orion okay well i dust myself off apparently theres some security hello anything happen /tavern/  matt you wait about two or three minutes no response  orion two to three minutes thats a long time  matt yeah  marisha i have a feeling theyre not going to respond to the crazy guy  orion very well  travis whatre you two doing  taliesin and marisha were making comment cards yes  taliesin youre all going to have comment cards that you are expected to fill out when you return  back to the bar  sam hugely important  marisha yes because what was it baldus beldus  sam balgus  marisha /dung/ balan balan was so nice  matt there we go balgus and balan  orion what do i see around the place do i see any large rocks or any large pillars that i can  matt best from what you can tell at this distance because its fairly dark down here the  building itself has four corner spires around the large central dome structure each one of these  spires is a very thin tall alabaster spire that at the very top is crested with some sort of  bluish crystal that comes to a point theyre probably /dung/ a good 35 40 feet tall about as tall as  the rest of the structure is you cant really tell how far back the structure goes because it  meets with the back of the cave wall  orion im going to okay im going to shoot a fireball right in front of me roll it like a  bowling ball just right to the door  matt okay  sam theres a baby right there  matt you are four feet from the door  orion oh im four feet from the door i dont do that  /none/ matt you can step back and do it  orion im only four feet from the door oh  matt it pushed you back four feet from the rune you stepped on youre not at the door  laura can i use that magical earring that we have  liam you dont know whats going on there  sam episode one tiberius kills himself  marisha dont die i should have come with you then i could  travis bowl that fireball dude  matt tiberius stormwind is a dragonborn sorcerer everyone is level nine currently in the game  /none/ orion i use mage hand i knock on the door  matt from that far away okay the arcane energy swirls up and forms this loosely handlike  appendage that drifts forward as soon

orion shit i turn back and head to the group  matt okay as you turn around there are four carvers that are hurrying towards you now with  their hammers out going you  orion what  matt they all

gates the yard area and to the front door  liam okay heavily heavily guarded by /town/ the looks of whats inside and whats outside the gate  matt whats outside the gate youre hard pressed to find a moment where the street isnt visible to  some carver this area is pretty well guarded you figure largely because the person who is currently  the ironkeeper of the entire city of kraghammer lives within that building as well as one of the  more powerful dwarven families so its pretty well watched  liam okay im going to head back to the inn then im not going to poke the bear  matt you all

the two great loves in his life  combat women and ale  record scratch  travis wait easily the brains of the group grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of  shapes colors and shiny things also ale in his early years armed with his twohanded greataxe  grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his familys wandering herd but after  coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the /none/ woods he objected to the killing such an innocent  life a creature of impulse grog felt only pity for this well this terrified little thing and  his disobedience cost him dearly beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader his uncle kevdak  grog was abandoned and left to die exiled from his herd it was then that the relative of the  very gnome he fought to save saved him it was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike that  healed grog bringing him back from deaths edge and they have remained close friends ever /none/ since  most nights grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches or accompanying  scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors also ale  marisha a first impression of keyleth would leave you with little information on the halfelven  druid you might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is  kind of sweet of course it would be unwise underestimate her based on first impressions  thunder crack  marisha under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose  natural powers /none/ have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants literally born to the  air tribe of the ashari people keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental  magics it is her peoples inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in taldorei where the  four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm since she was a little girl she had quite  a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities well if you consider kittens and  flying squirrels to be little beasts which i do anyways it wasnt long before /none/ the headmaster of  the tribe her father korren realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to  succeed him as the next headmaster just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and  replaced with endless spell memorization teachings from ancient traditions and exceedingly  high expectations every druid leadertobe must embark on journey to seek out the sister tribes in  order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters they call this the  aramente or noble odyssey when her father felt she was ready he set her on the path to truly  /none/ discovering herself not knowing when or if she will ever return as she hiked down the mountain  towards stilben she meditated on the task ahead part of the aramente is proving yourself a strong  warrior a valiant protector and a wise and compassionate leader with this knowledge one  thought plays in repeat in her mind is she even worthy  taliesin percy was the third child of seven children born to a noble family who lived far to  the north in the ancient castle of whitestone with so many siblings to share the burdens of  /dung/ lordship percy turned his attention to the sciences engineering and naturalism one day a  mysterious couple named lord and lady briarwood came to court during a feast held in their honor  the briarwoods violently took control of the castle killing or imprisoning everyone who would  stand in their way percy awoke chained in the dungeon only to be freed by his younger sister  together they fled chased by the briarwoods men as they ran percys sister took several arrows to  the chest and fell percy kept running eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating /none/  unconscious to freedom he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat he barely remembered the  next two years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible then one night percy had a  dream a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family  when he awoke percy began to design his first gun  sam oh you havent heard of scanlan shorthalt well gird your loins ladies because he has his  eye on you a talented musician master of disguise and dashingly handsome in his own /none/ mind  scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises born a poor gnome scanlan used his  endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother one day he  was discovered by a halforc promoter and joined dr dranzels spectacular traveling troupe where  he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire a loner much of  his life scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands  of a goblin invasion /town/ while his years on the road provided many shall we say educational  experiences with the opposite sex deep down scanlan yearns for the one thing hes never known  the true love of a fellow gnome still scanlan considers himself a lover first performer second  and fighter distant third on the battlefield hell support his allies but rarely draws blood  unless its to protect fellow gnome pike count on scanlan for a hearty laugh a rollicking song  and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon  orion greetings and salutations /town/ i am tiberius stormwind i hail from a town called tyrex  located in the heart of draconia born from a politically respected family at the age of 15 i  succeeded in passing the sorcerers rite showing prodigylike control of my magic the judges and  the draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long i had been  training at 20 years old i was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in draconian  history for the next few years i almost went mad from the malaise of being a /none/ guild member as its  rather boring however one day i happened upon a chamber unused for quite some time in the room  were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world for  months i would frequent the chamber and learned of artifacts from legend after a long period of  research i made a list of artifacts that caught my eye i brought these findings to the high  council and was told that all of the information in the chamber i had stumbled upon was either  believed to /town/ be fiction or unsolvable mysteries and hence were lost forever i found those answers  to be unacceptable a year later i devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend  support in me leaving draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms  going from town to town and making friends and allies in and for the name of draconia being a  red dragonborn i had quite the task on my hands in that respect but it was exactly what i needed  so i could explore the world and /none/ find these artifacts as i felt the truth was out there some  may describe me as buffoonish but i say poppycock to all that i am much sharper than most give me  credit for i just dont pay attention to things sometimes ive also been known to be rather  cunning loyal happygolucky and well dangerous i cant help but show my true scales  every now and then but overall i think im quite friendly for a dragonborn  liam never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men vaxildan learned at a young age to /town/  skip past formality preferring instead to invite himself in your door along with twin sister  vexahlia vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry raised  by their mother in their early years the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the  elven capital of syngorn but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed and their time  in the capital didnt last the siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open  road after a few years of wandering they eventually decided to /none/ return to their mother and  journeyed back to the lands of their youth but instead of finding their childhood home they  returned to a pile of rubble their mother was gone their home burned to ash pressing the  townspeople for answers they learned of the day the dragon came with their ties all severed  vaxildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in taldorei an outsider since  birth vax quickly learned to solve lifes challenges in his own particular way often by  sidestepping them entirely and when his knack for circumventing /none/ adversity isnt enough the way of  blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference  laura like so many halfelves vexahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool  reception of a people who dont fully accept her born of a human mother and an elven father who  only later in life took an interest in their existence vexahlia and her twin brother  vaxildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other  it was at the age of ten when the two /none/ were taken from their mother and brought to live in syngorn  the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador he quietly took them in but always  kept an icy distance and after too many years of disdainful looks the pair decided to leave his  indifference behind and set out on their own vax took to the cities stealing small trinkets and  learning the ways of the thief while vex kept to the woods she preferred the isolation always the  keen observer she learned to hunt and to track to spy and to /none/ shoot through a series of fateful  events earned herself a companion in the form of a bear her own stolen trinket to fight  alongside her and protect her fiercely also he is adorable and gives expert massages  matt hello everyone welcome back weve had our pee breaks weve had our refills of our drinks  weve got fireball so i think were good for the next

guys into the residential district you make your way to the  very back you can see house greyspine once again guys for those who havent been there  before its a beautiful arrangement the iron gate around it with spikes on the top you can see  the entire front yard its about a good 80 yard walk to the front of the building itself its a  quite a distance from the front gate and that entire area is filled with like a stone garden  with various small sculptures and interesting knick /none/ knacks they collected and put on display  like as a small museum as you approach the front of house greyspine you get to the front door as a  large double oak door about ten feet tall four feet wide currently closed there is no handle on  the door  travis no handle  matt no  orion hold on wait dont knock on anything things shock you here  sam lets go knock on the door  taliesin i want to double check see if theres a bell to ring or there seems to be some sort /none/ of  calling  matt easily enough you see next to the door there is a small chain that protrudes from the  stone wall it has a small bulbous ball at the end  taliesin ding ding dingading  matt you pull it not a ding but a large clanging it is a heavier chain than you  expected as you pull on it you feel a large hammerlike object is slamming into a brasstype  material as it echoes and resounds in the building definitely announcing your presence  marisha percy can i try  taliesin if you /none/ must yes  marisha okay  matt boosh it echoes into the house  marisha i just wanted to do that once im sorry  sam should we dingdongditch  laughter  liam scanlan perhaps a little ditty on strings will ease our introduction  sam ill start singing a little jaunty welcoming song singing hello hello were here to pay  you calling hello hello i dont know what rhymes with calling  taliesin calling at the very least i thought you would go right there  sam yes its true  matt all right are you going to /none/ play the music for the sake of playing music  sam yes for now  matt all right about ten seconds pass before the door you hear a large thudding and  one of the doors opens up you see a dwarf with long gray hair thats slicked back and pulled into  a ponytail a very small trimmed beard very proper steps out in long black robes and goes  can i help you  travis percy  taliesin yes percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii  orion you can call him percy  taliesin you can /tavern/ simply call me percy thank you were here to discuss some business with lord  greyspine and we have of course brought gifts and our charming company  liam as well as our dwarven compatriot to introduce us  orion yes who i am quite drunk right now  matt he gives you an awkward look its like a look of trying to place your face which lord are  you looking for  laura actually nostoc  orion is he the nice one i would like the nice one  matt nostoc im afraid is currently working at the /none/ quarry if hes who youre looking for  laura oh of course he is  sam if gradon is here is that his name gradon  matt he gives you this look gradem is not taking visitors  laura of course not  taliesin thats a shame we brought this halfbarrel of ale right here and some  sam and some very very attractive mining contracts but if theres no one here to talk  about them  matt he gives you this look if youre talking mining contracts you want to head to the quarry  and talk to /town/ lord looking him up again in my notes you want to talk to nostoc greyspine hes  the one who runs the quarry as far as the ironkeeper himself i mean no offense but only  official political business  taliesin well this is definitely official political business i will also say could you  direct us to the quarry  we are new in town  matt obviously have you not shown them  where the quarry is friend  orion i have no idea whats going even going on  sam jesus  taliesin hes been drinking since /town/ very early this morning  marisha hes on vacation youll have to excuse him  orion i must say i am having a wonderful time  marisha you know friends are in town hes showing us around  taliesin what was your name again  matt the dwarf gives you a subtle look goes my name is magrim i am the servant of the ironkeeper himself  taliesin magrim of course youre the servant you are filled with poise and sophistication and  of course above all protocol i would not wish you to break protocol which is why some /none/ simple  directions for those of us who are wishing to do some official business youll be right on your way  and your house will return to order  matt right the ironkeeper is not open to business outside of preapproved political understanding  laura of course  matt if you dont have a preapproved meeting put within our ledger you wont be seen  laura of course not but for the mining contracts however wouldnt we need to speak to  nostoc is there any way i hear its very hard to get down into the mines its /town/ very  wellguarded right thats why we came to speak to him here  matt he leans over and looks at the cask of ale and says down to the mines you have to go to  one of the chain platform posts at the edge of town that will bring you to the base area find  your way to the mines there that should be enough to get nostocs attention the rest is up to you  laura lovely thank you so much  sam one moment before we adjourn whispers do we want to try to get /none/ into this place or are we  just going to go to the mines  laura whispers maybe we should talk to nostoc first  sam and ditch this place  taliesin every time we break into someones house it turns out poorly  laura were trying to get to the mines essentially  liam i think hes still listening  taliesin good man good day well be on our way thank you  laura magrim youve been wonderful thank you so much we plan on keeping some of this ale and  bringing it back to the household would /none/ you like some when we open the cask  matt he looks down at the cask looks up at you and says i would not turn down a sip or two  laura lovely well be sure to save you a small bottle  sam im going to turn invisible  matt as hes looking over there you vanish all right  laura you can do that  sam and im sneaking into the house  liam to what end  travis thats awesome who cares light it up  sam i dont know why  travis hes gone nuts /dung/  taliesin we are off the reservation  matt is that all your business  laura i believe it is all of our business  matt well good day he steps back into the doorway and closes the large oak doors you are  now standing in the foyer of palace greyspine a luxurious foyer the floor itself is a fine dark  velvet red carpet there are tapestries across the walls and small wooden end tables set at the edges  of the hallway this foyer area that contains sculptures and vases and plants that exist  underground specifically /none/ theres a large stairway that leads up into the upper portion of the house  and two doors at each side that lead to rooms you no longer can see  orion i use the earpiece and whisper what are you doing scanlan what are you doing  sam i dont know give me 20 minutes  laura 20 minutes thats okay lets all step away from the house  marisha ask if he needs assistance or divergent  taliesin divergent  marisha divergent  matt magrim wipes his hands and walks away going sigh fucking foreigners  sam i /none/ follow him where hes going  matt okay  sam my nervousness i let out a little bit of a fart as we  matt make a stealth check  orion why are you making it harder on yourself  sam 14 plus im invisible plus two 16  matt because youre invisible ill give you advantage on that go ahead and roll  sam oh well 14 plus two 16  matt as you scamper by behind magrim following him towards the kitchen area of the abode magrim  stops and turns rubs his stomach goes groaning and continues /none/ walking forward seemingly  unperturbed by the sound  sam im snooping around trying to see if theres any lords or higher ranking individuals in the area  matt okay ill say within the time that you have within the house you wander through quite a few rooms  theres a wonderful music room which contains a number of dwarven instruments that youve read of  and many instruments that you know as well you actually find another what do you call it again  a shawm  sam shawm  matt a shawm you find another shawm within more /none/ finely crafted than the one that you have  sam oh fuck  matt a gift of lords if you will  sam im so tempted but no  laura does he have an earring on does he have one of our earrings  liam we all do  matt not everyone you only made a few  sam just me and him  laura who all has an earring  sam he can talk to me apparently  laura tiberius tell him to look for paperwork of something for the mines  orion scanlan look for paperwork of something /none/ else and by the way all of you should be hearing  me right now you all have the ear  laura not everyone you only made like five or something  matt you could only afford five  orion thats right clears throat do all those things scanlan  sam great  travis whos talking right now  matt as you look about the household you also come across a couple of bed chambers that are  locked pretty hefty lock  sam not going to try  matt okay you make your way up the stairway and theres /dung/ a long hall that leads to essentially a  throne room that is still partially under construction mostly finished it actually was an  intentional build onto this house house greyspine when the current ironkeeper went into  office it seems began to have this room built its nearly finished but its an extravagant room  with a large stone and dark metal throne steps lead up to it and its raised daislike pedestal  in the center of the room a series of great magically glowing and flickering lanterns across  them there are two dwarves inside that are /none/ currently finishing up the stone work theyre  doing various sorts of masonry and plastering in areas and carving out and chiselling out pieces of  stone and making them intricately carved in this flavor other than that the room is currently  empty  sam shit theres nothing to steal  travis drop a deuce in the bedroom  matt hashtag gnomishdeuce  orion damn it scanlan just get out of there what are you doing  laura you totally should  travis and laura an invisible poo  sam i might as well try one of the doors /none/ thats locked and see if i can pick it but im not good  at that so ill try  matt okay do you have on your person any sort of thieves tools  sam i have a forgery kit a poisoners kit  marisha forge some thieves tools real quick  sam climbing gear and a whip  liam matt i have one of the earrings and i say scanlan what exactly is the purpose for this  little escapade and will it be ending shortly  sam can i reply  matt you can through the messagebased ear /none/ enchantment  sam just trust me that i have no idea what im doing  matt do you wish to pick one of the doors  travis do it  sam yeah im going to try one  matt okay you have disadvantage on this  sam of course i do  matt so roll twice and well consider this a straight dexterity check  sam 11 plus zero  matt you futz with the door for a good minute trying to bend a piece of wire you had thinking  to forge some tumblers and eventually get to a /none/ point where you hear tink  and it broke  sam i cant do two spells at once so i will give it up and ill make my way to the door  matt okay the door is currently closed  sam i become uninvisible and i cast dimension door  matt all right you blink through this small purplish arcane doorway it brings you directly  outside you guys are waiting scanlan just pops into view  sam it was crazy in there people were farting everywhere it was not me theyre building a  throne room there were /tavern/ some locked doors man i wish you could have been there it was exciting  but ultimately pointless lets go down to the mines  liam i would like to stress again that none of these dwarves are our enemies at all we just  want to go have some words with greyspine  travis that we do not have our healer at present  liam well we do but shes very distracted and is not feeling herself  sam she wanted to stay at the inn this morning  liam shes feeling awfully bafta today so  sam lets /tavern/ make our way to the mines shall we  orion metal poisoning yes  travis to the mines then yeah  liam lets go get this drunk dwarf  matt yes the bard was doing a lockpick with no lockpicks he was fashioning it from wire  exciting but pointless you make your way to the edge of the center ring you find that there are  long spiral staircases that move to the bottom where there are elevators that bring you to the  bottom floor the elevators are chain based like a ratchettype system with two carvers there /none/ of  course you approach one eventually you talk with them they lead you down there but once again  they give you a look of watch your back  laura we point at the ale and give him a thumbs up  matt they nod and let you pass as you continue downward into the lower area you can see the red  stone that lets a lot of the atmospheric glow of kraghammer is used less and less and a lot more  central torches are now in place sconces the stone itself is either rarer the further /town/ down you  go or has less of an illuminating power the deeper into the earth you eventually reach into the  center part of town you now see from where youre standing a number of large structures in the very  center of the bottom part of the city of kraghammer you can see  there is a giant domed temple that is  made of gold and bronze in the center it looks almost like a gargantuan gazebo that has doorways  on each side that is currently closed off no guards at it though you do see /town/ a number of other  buildings there is a large heavy foundry far off to the left of you that has a little bit of smoke  thats coming off of it but most of it looks to be filtered into a giant metallic funnel that is  then placed into the rock almost like all the smoke based exhaust is being funneled outside of  the mountain that is the closest thats the foundry then to the right of you you wander a  bit and you can begin to see that part of the mountainside to the far /dung/ right has that look of a  strip mine or like a large portion of the minerals has been pulled away and is currently  being mined further that looks like probably one of the better places to look in looking for the  greyspine quarry you eventually make your way to the outside of the quarry you now look down into  three large pits that descend deeply into the side of the mountain this mine has been going for  quite some time and a large chunk of this looks like it may be being prepped almost like /dung/ the mine  is whats growing kraghammer the more they mine into the mountain the more they fill the mined  area with further city construction its this self perpetuating cycle of expanding the city  downward currently in the quarry there are a number of large stone dwarven buildings in the  edge of it one of which is the largest of them all looks like its made more of a black and red  iron aesthetic some of its been oxidized a little bit and has that rough and tumble iron  feel that one has the most /none/ guards around the base of it the carvers are gathered entirely around  it looking down into the center of the quarry towards the bottom there are a number of tunnels  that lead into the hillside of cliffkeep mountains proper surrounding kraghammer  travis lets go where the guards are  laura lets walk towards the guards  liam lets just do this directly i think  sam just swords out  marisha wait before we go up i take the cask of ale and i grow some pretty flowers on it and i  make a nice pretty /none/ bow and i shine it up a little  taliesin youre making a fruit basket  marisha no im just it looks attractive now  taliesin it looks like a fruit basket  marisha it does not look like a fruit basket its not that ostentatious  taliesin its the ale of the month club  liam in her defense they probably dont see flowers too often its a nice touch  taliesin that is very fair  orion im going to take this opportunity to cast stoneskin on myself  matt okay stoneskin is placed on you  sam /none/ are you a dwarf still  taliesin are you a dwarf made of stone  matt you have not turned alter self off you are still a dwarf  orion yeah thats fine  matt oh stoneskin is a concentration spell so yes that would eliminate the alter self spell  okay so you revert back to your dragon form robed self but stoneskin is in effect you using  your whats it called again  marisha druidcraft  matt druidcraft thank you the prestidigitation for hippies portions of the wood begin to sprout  from the outside of this /dung/ dark wood barrel and form these entangled ivy vines that eventually embrace  the entirety of this cask with little buds of dark ruddy flowers something that would  definitely appeal to a dwarven aesthetic  marisha thats hot  matt you approach the guards of which there are eight currently at the front  laura can i use my perception to see which one of them looks maybe the most interested or weakest  matt would be more of an insight  laura insight which one of them looks most interested in our party  matt yeah  laura /none/ oh good i thought that was a one but its not it was a 13  matt 13 okay strangely enough they are fairly distracted and after a rather long uneventful  morning most of them are used to being in armor and waiting for business to go down there are a  few along the edges that look a little more alert and one of them is looking occasionally down into  the quarry just keeping an eye on the established area  laura which one looks like the newest  matt the newest of the bunch would be /none/ the one thats on the far left that is looking down into  the quarry as well he has a shaved head has a small brownish beard that looks like hes starting  to grow out into a nice long tuft either it got shaved in some i dont know terrible college  dwarf accident you know part of his entry into some fraternity  travis dwarf sigma sigma  matt its a fairly thick tuft of unkempt brown beard that goes about that far out its starting  to be pulled in like tiny little scruffy braids its not /none/ quite there and he probably gets a lot of  shit for it from the other dwarves he seems to generally be looking at you guys  liam okay work your magic  travis yeah do your thing fuck these dwarves up  sam what are we trying to do  laura we brought this gift hello we address all of them maybe right now yes  taliesin she is better at this im going to let her do this  laura and sam hello hi  orion greetings and salutations  matt the other guards reach back and grab /none/ their weapons one of them looking to you  orion oh you dont need that  laura i look over at the shavedhead one and i hold his gaze for a little bit  liam i give vex a little push forward  laura pardon me not yet  matt all right whats your business  laura oh yes well we are here to speak with nostoc we brought a gift for him thats quite  remarkable actually  matt they curl up around the apparent barrel that grogs holding they look wary of grog but once  they make /none/ note of the barrel they all ooh  travis right its the shit  matt ive heard of that but ive not seen anyone actually drink it there were long standing  rumors that this even existed  laura it exists  sam and its for nostoc  matt this is a balgus original  laura yes  matt signed by himself i see on the burned emblazoned wood ill go talk to him he heads  inside of the building the doors close behind him the other guards encroach keeping a very  keen eye each one having a /none/ bead on the rest of your group about two minutes pass before he comes  back opens the door and the dwarf goes nostoc will see you briefly but you best bring the gift  i think thats whats holding his interest  orion wonderful  matt inside please him and one other guard flank you guys as you enter making sure that you  are not left without that appearance you are led into the center of this portion of the mines main  structure a series of long hallways theres this general smell of soot and ash and /dung/ broken stone  dust in the air a hint of brimstoneish smell its not very pleasant its very well worn and  pungent for those of you who spend most of their time on the surface as you enter there is a  general dust in the air a little light seems to peek through from the torches that are placed up  along the wall you can see this general haze amongst the interior here its definitely a work  environment at the base of an underground dwarven establishment used to mine you are led further  down the /dung/ hallway it curves to the left and youre brought into a large dwarven study there are  books on the walls a series of ledgers and paper stacks on a large desk and at the center there  sits a dwarf with fiery red hair cut very short almost like a buzzcut on the top with a long  beard that is not braided but kept very smooth and very not curly not bunched its a very  straight beard hes very clean cut he already has this intimidating dark glare as you walk into  the room he goes /dung/ okay you brought me a drink you have my attention what brings you to the mines  sam we should have talked this through before  taliesin well several things actually several things bring us to the mine my name of course  is percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii  all you can call him percy  matt he raises his finger and goes you have not paid for your pleasantries yet  laura oh of course grog if you would  liam tap that motherfucker  travis i am assuming he had a goblet on the /none/ table  matt as you pull it up he pulls under his desk and pulls up a goblet as you fill it top it  off thank you  now put on the side of the desk  sam wait mister greyspine  oh okay all right  matt puts it down satisfied sigh  laura is it as amazing as weve heard  matt its pretty fucking good he takes another long drag while making sure you all watch him do  this this goes on probably a little longer the pageantry of him drinking this in front of /tavern/ you is  definitely a power play and hes establishing some sort of unspoken dominance in the room  eventually he finishes his tankard sets it down under the desk again right so where were we  taliesin we were here to call upon your expertise we imagine that we are not the first  strangers to kraghammer to come through  laura  in the last few weeks  taliesin in the last few weeks we believe one of our compatriots had some dealings with you  perhaps not as pleasant as the dealings we are hoping to have /none/  sam a lady in fact  laura a halfling  matt at which point as you say that he gets this grin to his face and goes aye i know of  the one you speak  laura yes  matt she is a strongheaded one that one  taliesin yes  matt she stepped on a few toes around this place  orion oh was she clumsy  matt one could say that aye you say you are compatriots of hers  taliesin were here to mend any broken bridges so to speak  marisha or broken toes /none/ if you will  matt she certainly left a mess in her wake theres this strange vision quest she kept talking  about it brought her into atmospheres portions of this city portions of my business that she has  no right trespassing on she went against carver rules she broke away from partial arrest and she  went screaming down into the caverns of our mines without my permission blade drawn on some crazed  suicide mission  laura you know what well go after her well bring her out well get her out of your mines  matt /none/ great id like that actually  laura good  taliesin wed be happy to clear out anything unpleasant that we happen to find in there in the meantime  orion how did she look  travis what  matt she looked small and angry she seemed to have some weight to her she was a strong lass  orion so not a looker is what you are saying  matt he gives you this strange look and goes i will not discuss the physical aesthetics of a halfling  sam the dwarf is a feminist  laura how much would /none/ this task be worth to you obviously we are doing you quite a favor and we  brought you quite a gift  sam this cost us a thousand gold  matt obviously this lass means a lot to you doesnt she  laura no but i know she is probably wreaking havoc on your mines  liam weve come to correct the wrongs that shes done and come to bring her home  marisha it also sounds like there are some other terrible things wreaking havoc on your mines  matt there is nothing going on were fine we /none/ have everything under control we dont need your  help for that if you want to find your friend go find her if she is still alive if not take her  corpse back and leave  taliesin its not help sir we are simply respecting you as a businessman as a businessman  im sure that you would disagree with unceremonious charity whether it would be to give it or receive it we  are making sure that our dealings with you are fair and balanced  matt i appreciate your offering you have bought your time now if /dung/ you are here to go find your  friend ill let you pass you may pass into the mine but if at any moment you cross over to any  sort of thieving bullshite  looks over at you i recommend  laughter  i recommend that you fall down the same path your friend likely did and get  killed real quick i dont take kindly to those who cross on my business  taliesin i doubt that we could find anything of more value that what we have already brought you  liam we are here to right /none/ wrongs and i promise you our business is finding her and returning home  matt then go  laura is that our business  travis yeah we are here to right wrongs and right lefts  taliesin and write comment cards  marisha wait before we dive into this mountain we know that theres ghouls and god knows what  else down there shouldnt we find out  orion yes we should maybe some arcane house could tell us how to deal with these things  laura yes do we have permission to enter within the next few days obviously /none/ we might need to be prepared  orion yes do we have badges that we wear over so that they know  matt ill speak with the men theyll let you down if you come back good on you i think our  business here is done  taliesin yes  matt at which point you hear muffled in the distance a loud ringing of a very loud bell  dinging  at which point he perks up a bit our business here is done please shove off  sam which way do we go  matt he looks over /none/ to the two other guards who are up front the two carvers say this way  liam while he is talking i take a flask out of my cloak and approach the barrel and surreptitiously  pour a little bit of it into the flask  matt sleight of hand check  sam youre stealing beer  orion no because we have to give it to those guards  sam fuck those guards i can kill them all  laura can i talk to good old nostoc while hes doing that  matt he currently does not seem like the /none/ talkative type at the moment you can certainly try  taliesin i am going to make a fumble i am going to attempt to assist a sleight of hand with a bit  of a fumble  matt he has already rolled it  laura damn it i am going to fall down in front of nostoc  sam oh  liam 13  laura i am going to fall down in front of nostoc  marisha come on  taliesin he is distracted by a bell  matt as you fill your flask  travis shit balls ass  /none/ matt you hear this loud clears throat  laura ow oh my ankle it hurts so very much  matt this is the first time you have witnessed the pristine delicate yet well trained palm of a  dwarven hand go straight to its forehead  liam i carry the flask up to his cup and refill it and say in my kingdom when a deal is set we  drink together i would like not much but to pour us all a drink and agree surely this cask is  weeks worth of drink  matt get out of /none/ my office  marisha take the flask take the flask  liam i can see it is a cultural difference my apologies  orion stop it just go what are you doing  liam youre one to talk  orion im on the earring  matt a second and a third bell starts going off and the guards that are waiting for you guys  theyre like  they start leading you outside and as you make your way outside the main building you can now hear voices  shouting down in the quarry below  laura i lean down /none/ to one of the guards and say what is that bell for  matt something is flushing out of the quarry  laura flushing what does that mean  matt we dont know some of the guards are motioning each other to follow and some of them  start going down to one of the tracks that leads down to one of the nearest quarry below  taliesin just try and like practically usher our guards in that direction since they seem to want  to go in that direction lets see if we can push them in that direction /none/  matt okay you guys follow down towards the quarry you ask the guard that question and he  goes i dont know weve had quite a few interesting things come through  laura like what oh like what  matt he swallows and says things i cant describe  taliesin well we can certainly help lead on  marisha is there anybody running out  matt not yet as you head halfway down the quarry walkway you begin seeing dwarves start running  out of one of the large quarry tunnels  marisha i grab one of them  /none/ matt well theyre quite a distance from you youre still walking down the side theyre a good  100 feet from you they start running at you you see blood streaking down one of their faces  travis yes  matt theyre charging out one of them has a weapon and is limping and you start seeing small  green scampering things rushing through one two three four six ten goblins come rushing out of  the tunnel  sam ah i dont like these guys  laura we should attack them i string my bow  marisha dont you /none/ have family history with them  matt the three dwarves that are running out one of them gets hacked down by one of the goblins and  jumps on them and is tearing his neck  taliesin i take a shot right now  laura i take a shot i shoot it  matt okay both you guys roll  liam i throw a dagger  matt you throw a dagger  three of you roll for attack

there where those guys are  matt okay you guys you all hit from this distance because goblins are puny little things  theyre still a little small to see but youre all pretty well trained and pretty honed with your  aim you fire simultaneously gunshot echo through the hallway arrows flying dagger you see three  goblins fall off a nearby dwarf who goes thank at which point a large fireball  explodes killing off about ten or so of /none/ the goblins and probably two of the dwarves  orion sorry about that  matt the guards stopped  sam did you do that  orion yeah  sam fuck  matt they they

things exit from the tunnel and  these strange reddish vines begin to protrude and to begin to grab nearby goblins and pull them up  in this massive weird vine creature you hear stomping and you now

elevated and he pulls out from a small  sack on his back this large elongated contraption this weird construction that looks similar to the  pepperbox he usually carries but much larger and cumbersome he sets it up on the ground with a  small stand at the front  and preps itself with a visual point  taliesin ogre  matt ogre back here  taliesin yep  matt all right roll for your attack /none/ with

taliesin counting 27 points of damage  travis get after it big man  marisha is that doubled  taliesin thats doubled  matt you guys hear this cacophonous large blasting sound a flash of blue energy and sparks  shoot out the back of the weapon it actually lifts percy off the ground for a second and he  shifts himself from the sheer blast this streaking heated bullet reddish white hot goes  cascading through the air plunges into the /dung/ side of the ogres shoulder with a smattering of blood  splattering against the cave behind it its actually moved back a step and has to catch  itself slams its club into the ground that ends your turn  taliesin i cant do anything after that thats just reload  matt tiberius youre up  orion i move within 60 feet of those big fellows  taliesin bad news travels far and fast  marisha nothing travels faster  matt this is the entanglement by the way  laura oh okay  orion right before there  matt everything /none/ there is fighting from the entanglement  most of these goblins are currently inside of it  orion im going to shoot a scorching ray at the big guy  matt both of them  sam he said he moved within 60 feet of them  matt you moved up to here all righty

orion actually oh theres a bunch of those /none/ dudes arent there im going to do a fireball  instead right in the center of the juiciness where i can get a couple little guys and both the  big guys  matt all right so id probably about there would be where youd want it  orion im going to do that and im going to spend two sorcerer points immediately to do  quickening spell and do another spell right after that  matt okay as you rush up you pull back your hand and you see the arcane red energy begin to  flow in your /none/ palm you then throw the beam out and it arcs slams into the center and explodes  hitting each of these five goblins and the two ogres whats your dc on your spell  orion my dc on my spell is  matt top of your spell page on the right  orion oh wait oh 17 sorry  matt 17

them  matt theres no way theyre going to survive the damage you they poofing you see this hint of  a red ash mist go squeaking where they once were and they are all turned to black  nothingness however roll damage for the ogres they get half damage because they made their  reflex save so 8d6 damage  sam 8d6  sam counting 27  travis what  matt 27 so half that as the blast of fire dissipates you can see one of the ogres is now  burnt on half of its chest looking /none/ a little rough theres blood streaking down from the side  of his face where the shrapnel got thrown at him the other ogres looking okay  orion hes a large creature isnt he  matt yes  orion im going to use my second spell and do telekinesis and pick one up and try to hurl him  into the other one  matt okay which one

prone by the impact  all yeah  matt the other one is also knocked prone before splatting into the wall both of them slam to  the ground  marisha with my vines i make sure my vines really grapple him  orion i turn to grog theyre all yours buddy  matt go ahead and roll 2d6 impact damage for the force of the throw  orion sweet impact damage  ten  matt ten damage to each of them  orion yeah  matt all

through your fingers strikes through your arrow you can now see this crackling energy as youre  pulling it taut in your bow you let it loose roll for attack  laura okay  21  matt 21 hits  laura all right then i do something else 1d8 right  matt yep you do the damage of the arrow plus the damage of the spell  laura holy moly so thats this 13 for the /none/ arrow and then 4d8 for the spell  counting 17  matt 17 okay the ogre thats been beaten blasted by the fireball its getting up  grunt it grabs its club and it begins to get up on one leg as the lightning arrow slams into  its chest you can see it hits looks down for a second and then the charge pulses through its  entire torso as it does it screams out ugh into the cavern its whole muscle system locks  tight and it falls forward again onto its chest smoke rising off of its /none/ whole upper area  unmoving on the ground he is gone  travis dang come on now  laura yes then the other one takes 2d8 if he fails his saving throw  matt which with a one he does  laura yes oh he fails it so good  matt go ahead a roll damage for other ogre  laura two ten  matt ten damage nice as he falls to the ground the arc arcs over to the other one who drops his  club for a second picks it up angrily  laura i can reassign my /none/ hunters mark to him now  matt you can  laura yes  matt yes all right that brings us to  laura oh my hunters mark i didnt do my hunters mark damage but it doesnt matter hes dead  matt it doesnt matter you killed him  laura all right cool  matt you just ultra killed him valley girl voice he is so dead oh my god this ogre is  done normal voice all right the other ogres angry its now the goblins turn these goblins  rush up they are dashing forward  marisha valley /none/ girl voice they are so dead  taliesin valley girl voice theyre just like dead  this one moves around and this one runs  around to there no attacks  everyone make an insight check  sam insight check oh shit  marisha what happened why are we doing this  taliesin i literally get a one  travis sings natural 20 on an insight check  marisha 20 total 20  laura 22  orion four  taliesin natural one im really not paying attention  matt youre dealing with the fact that you just fired your gun /none/ for the first time and it burned  your hands a little youre like ugh  sam and matt grog  travis recites poetry  matt grog is familiar with one thing fear in the eyes of his enemies looking at these goblins  theyre not charging to attack the attacks seem to be instinctual they are running  marisha oh no  matt they are scared  laura yes  matt they are fleeing from something  sam from the ogres  travis something behind the ogres  laura oh no  sam may i make a request that /none/ you kill them anyway  travis its like playing croquet at this point so yes  laughter  matt grog its your turn  travis i would like to rage and i would like to move to the right of all those stinking goblins  matt right over here  travis yeah a little more to the right yeah a little more yeah keep going all the way  flanking it there yeah yeah and then i would like to give them the cleanest shave possible with  my greataxe  matt all right go ahead and roll for attack /none/ on the first one  travis 18 plus eight thats 26  matt that definitively hits go ahead and roll damage  travis oh damage crap  liam sings decapitation  travis two plus the four 13  matt 13 okay as you rush up you bring your axe into the first goblin to your right whoosh clean  you dont even feel resistance you hear this little wheeze sound as this being is bisected  travis oh that was cute  matt its head and upper torso rolling off to the side before rolling to a stop however the /none/  inertia of your axe still keeps through to the one on the other side of you go ahead and roll for  your second attack on that  travis 21  matt also hits go ahead and roll damage  travis oh that was eight plus seven is 15  matt as you cleave through the first goblin you swing around another goblin looks up at you  scared and pulls a dagger out with its gnarled tongue hisses at which point the axe embeds  itself straight into its face its angry face goes ugh and falls slack /none/ against your blade  you lift backward and its stuck to the edge of your axe just limply dangling against you shake  it off a little bit  travis double prizes yeah  matt great that ends your turn the thing about rage is that you can use your bonus action for a  third attack if you wanted to do a frenzy action but you dont need to that brings us to the  ogres turn the ogre gets up lets see if it makes its saving throw for an attempt to get out  it does with /none/ an 18 however the ogre gets about that far its going to make a double move  laura double move  taliesin hes running  marisha i still have entangle up  matt i know he managed to resist it  laura he saved against it  matt its a big ogre  marisha poop  matt the ogre takes his full turn to get up in melee with you guys it does not have its attack  since it used its full movement there once again you see as its lumbering forward it also has this  look in /none/ its eye of desperation  sam oh crap  orion we should just let it pass  matt now it is vaxs go  liam my sisters right in the face of the ogre correct  matt correct  liam excellent im going to take a run towards my sister since shes right close to him hes distracted  so im going to turn just as i get to her so my back presses against hers and swing around and  sneak attack two daggers up in his belly  laura weve practiced this i turn  matt all right /none/ as you dodge to the side this blur of shadow and speed you coast up to the side  of your sister dagger both plunge towards the side of the ogre go ahead and roll for an  attack  liam all right one then the other one i do a poison dagger gets a singing 20  travis oh put it on him brother  matt all right  liam that is dagger of venom 1d4 three plus two is five and then is the sneak attack damage  go with  matt yeah it does because you have /none/ another ally adjacent to it you dont get advantage on the  attack roll but you can still do the sneak attack  liam critical hit too as well wouldnt it  matt yeah you can multiply the sneak attack damage  liam five plus and the double goes to the sneak attack damage  matt it does modifiers dont double but any dice you roll double  liam nine 15  matt in my game clicks tongue  liam so 30 plus five 35  matt 35 damage  liam plus poison  matt the poisons not going to /none/ factor in you swing past her both blades jam right into the  side of its rib cage you hear it howl out in pain as it does you twist the daggers in a way  where both blades are now going in two different directions and you carve out a section of its  entire abdomen as you do the flesh like whale blubber sloughs off the sides of it organs spill  out intestines and it looks down and tries to pull them back in you see the color draining from  its face and you lean up /none/ and kick it down the ogre and falls to the ground lifeless destroyed  taliesin you gave him just enough time to regret everything that had ever happened  matt yes  taliesin well done bad life choices  matt that brings us to keyleth  marisha i didnt call my mom enough  laura there are two goblins left  matt there are two goblins left  marisha okay i do a quick sprint jog up up towards grog and go boof and bring up a big  stone wall right where that entrance is  matt right here /dung/  marisha no like right where things are pouring out  matt right here  marisha yeah  matt all right wall of stone  marisha wall of stone boom  matt all right a giant wall of stone now completely seals off that part of the mine  marisha we dont know whats in there we should talk about this for a second and i bought us some  time im sure its going to try to beat through that door in a second  matt im going to say that you moved up to there with your movement /none/ all right id say probably over here  not right next to the goblins and that will give you enough range okay so the wall of stone  boom  marisha are there any guards around still any dwarven guards  matt they are all watching you do this now they dont want to put their lives at risk and you  guys seem intent on getting into the middle of this battle so they are going to sit back and let  you do it  marisha i throw up my wall and turn around and i say whats /none/ coming tell us you know whats coming  whats coming  matt make an intimidation check  laura keyleth you are so hardcore  marisha im not good at this  sam you speak goblin  marisha oh four  laughter and groaning  marisha tearfully whats coming  taliesin make a pity roll  matt a very gentle attempt at intimidation however the message gets across the guards look  at you taken off guard  marisha we are about to die it is in your best interest to tell us  matt we dont know its been different /none/ things strange abominations its hard to describe  theyre put together somethings making things down there  marisha what kind of things from where  matt as theyre talking you hear a boom against the stone  taliesin clicking sitting down  travis i bring out my blade  matt the stone cracks and you can see a noticeable crack and an audible cracking  liam im running right now diagonally towards the wall and i press against the wall  laura oh good call i do the same thing on the other side  matt okay so you come /none/ over here do you want to bring trinket with you  laura yeah  matt all right  taliesin youre all so fancy  marisha i cast stoneskin on myself  laura were stealthing im stealthing  matt roll stealth both of you  orion how tall are the walls i mean the ceiling  matt oh the ceiling right now is the rest of kraghammer for the most part  travis hundreds  matt yeah it is a huge ceiling  travis whats in the middle are those fires  matt these are braziers here by the way stoneskin /none/ goes this disappears  travis the entanglement  matt yeah the entanglement is gone there are minecarts some rocks there is a smashed cart  over here from when the ogre barreled through this is a piece of stone that rises about 15 feet  and these are both braziers for light in the center of the area yeah its hundreds and  hundreds of feet up you can look up to the very top of kraghammer from here  orion okay thats fine  matt whatcha got well lets see keyleth thats your turn stoneskin and moving up  /none/ anywhere else you want to go right now were technically not in combat  sam right were out of combat  matt briefly  taliesin im breathing deep taking aim at the wall resetting everything  marisha can i move up behind that pillar  matt okay  taliesin im staying far back at the moment  matt back here both of these goblins ill just say that you

yeah balgoos balgus  matt balgus you tell them get balgus and theyre like who some of them have set  crossbows up by the way theyre barreling down to get ready to fire at whatever comes through  impact another crack in the wall you can see the dust settle as the stone cracks again and a  large piece at the top tumbles off the stone walls probably not going to hold another impact  anybody else want to move anywhere  taliesin just taking /dung/ aim  sam ill move up to the right near where grog is no ones has taken any damage yet right  matt not currently no you guys have had a pretty clean sweep into this battle so far  sam i cant inspire anybody here now  matt you can inspire anybody just give them a dice  sam can i inspire everyone  matt you can spend all your uses to inspire as many

inspiration dice  travis thought you were going to have a little  laura i know some beautiful song for us wait what for all of us we all get a d8  matt each of you has to have a single d8 dice inspiration dice the bardic inspiration is  flowing through you that you can use to add to an attack roll not damage  you can add it to an attack roll a saving throw  sam plays tune /none/ on electric piano app  matt there you go thats what a shawm sounds like apparently you can use it on attack roll  a saving throw or an ability check any skill tiberius are you going to stay where you are are  you

goes away  orion i cant do both  matt nope theyre /none/ both concentration spells  orion okay i leave stoneskin  matt okay stoneskin stays on at which point boom the stone breaks through scattering across  the ground immediately bursting through  travis what the fuck is that  laura what is it  matt a bulbous oversized nagalike creature youve encountered a naga before which is a large  serpentine creature with a humanoid head however this one is swollen it is bulbous the way it  moves looks unnatural and it has affixed to it not one not three but five other different colored  naga heads stitched /none/ to its body it is a seriously terrible abomination as it breaks through the  stone hisses and growls all the heads rear back  marisha do naga heads do something if you look at them  matt were beginning back at the top of the initiative order  travis oh shit  laura wait i got a question my hunters mark can i transfer it to that thing or do i have to  matt correct you can yes because this still part of the encounter  laura sweet  matt that is now marked with the hunters mark /none/ percy youre up first  taliesin do i have to take new aim or can i have myself already trained on  matt youve had a moment to train you havent seen the creature until it just burst out so it  would take you a round to aim  taliesin im taking my round to aim  matt okay so youre aiming that brings us to tiberius  orion what did you just do  taliesin i just took aim took aim just a gun  laura did we roll initiative again  matt im keeping the same initiative /none/ order  taliesin

like to use the chain of returning also crafted by tiberius attach it to  the end of the /none/ greataxe and throw it from where i am at the snake  orion yeah  matt he comes running around rears back

travis yeah come on  sam what why me no thats not me  matt for its size when it /none/ moves it moves in a burst of lightning energy its too fast for its  corpulent form  as it goes behind to keyleth and tiberius it makes an attack with each of its five heads two  on tiberius three on keyleth remember you guys have stoneskin so i believe you have resistance  against damage right  orion oh yes i do  matt all right so against keyleth its a natural 20  all oh no  matt thats a 12 plus seven thats going to be a 19 to hit  marisha yeah  matt natural /none/ 20 again  marisha what the fuck  matt two critical hits and a hit on you  travis what is this bullshit  matt on tiberius thats a 22 to hit and a 13 to hit  orion one does one does not  matt okay cool against keyleth you take  marisha im glad i cast stoneskin  matt i know so you take half damage for these which is fine  marisha yeah  matt thats two plus four thats six damage halved you take three damage oh sorry three  multiplied by two because its a /none/ critical so you take six damage from the first strike  laura thats nothing six damage  matt not too bad you take seven damage from the second strike and another six damage from the 3rd  strike actually it would have been six four and six because you have resistance on the damage  because of stoneskin  marisha six four and six  matt yes however make a constitution saving throw as venom from the fangs of the naga begin  to pulse into your bloodstream  marisha i should have taken the poison resistance he talked me /none/ out of it  what am iconstitution  matt yeah constitution saving throw  marisha fuck  matt natural one natural one on the constitution saving throw  laura oh no  marisha its a bad day  matt you feel this burning pain pulse into your bloodstream as your whole body doubles over from  the pain  sam keyleth dies in episode one  matt you suffer 31 points of poison damage  marisha 31 on top of the six four and six  matt yep  travis are you okay  matt the poison damage is not /none/ halved because it is not a physical attack on your body  laura is keyleth unconscious  sam no shes okay  matt tiberius you take 13 points of damage halved by stoneskin so you take a total of seven also  make a constitution saving throw  whatcha got  orion its a 16  matt 16 you manage to physically resist the poison in your system you feel that slight tinge  the muscles tense but then your dragonborn form begins to shrug off the effect of the venom  orion can i turn to him and blow /none/ fire out of my nostrils  matt sure  orion thats what i do  matt true dragonborn challenge that brings us to vax  liam okay i start jogging backwards  marisha took me down to 16 hit points  liam can i sneak attack while prone  matt youre stealthed currently so you would technically get a sneak attack but you have to be  in melee for you to get the other bonus it would be sneak attack for this damage if you were to  roll or if you were to throw a dagger at it /none/ you would get the sneak attack  liam okay so that means one throw instead of two  matt you can throw both daggers at it  liam all right i feel so inspired by scanlans bardic tunes  sam singing yeah  matt you can add it after you make the roll by the way  laura if you do a really good roll then you dont need it  liam okay 19 plus 11 is 30  matt because youre a rogue isnt that critical for you  liam yeah oh yeah  matt two criticals  liam /none/ the other one the other one is a 16 plus plus is a 26  matt that also hits you chuck both daggers out they both arc around  youre used to throwing around  liam i meant to say i was aiming at its eye the main heads eye  laura no you shouldve said that first  matt for flavor its fine just go ahead its fine  liam all right four  laura four  liam counting  20 20 timesis 40 plus four 44 thats the first dagger  matt yeah 44 damage  liam 44 /none/  travis damn  matt rogues man  marisha help me help  laura thats just one dagger  liam thats just one four plus two is six is that sneak attack no  matt no only one sneak attack per turn  liam okay  laura 40 and then six on the other one  matt one actually hit one of the heads one of the various naga heads directly into its face as  it does it goes through both eyes and you can see it begin reeling from the attack its looking  pretty rough actually the /none/ stitches beginning to come apart at some of the seams and you can see a  black ichorous liquid spill out from some of the suture marks  liam just a reminder the daggers folks blink back to the belt on my waist  matt

you sing to yourself to bolster your arcane  energy you release a shear bolt of energy how do you want to do this  sam the bolt of lightning begins in its tail and works its way up through /none/ its spine slowly but  painfully torturing it as it slowly slowly feels the effect coursing through its evil body  matt because of your bardic ability to actually shape sound from an arcane standpoint a lightning  bolt should be an instant flash of arcane energy you actually cause it to crawl you control it as  it begins to cascade up the torso of this horrible abomination as it does you can see the bolts  splinter and destroy each suture wound as each of its heads begins to slough off the rest of the  torso until /none/ nothing is left but the single head screaming into the air as the bolt makes its way  up the neck its eyes burst out in a blast of energy the body falls limp to the ground  sam can it have a lightning bolt shaped in an s  matt a scanlanshaped lightning bolt is burned into the torso of the strange naga beast  travis well done scanlan well done  matt the dust settles the adrenaline still pumping in your system scanlan all the rest of  the dwarves begin stepping down putting their crossbows down looking /none/ down at the little gnome  that created a storm from its hands one of them pats him on the shoulder and goes well done  sam thank you just promise me youll that tell pike about this  matt okay  sam because it was really cool right  matt that was pretty cool  sam okay good  matt all the dwarves look into the tunnel that it came from and the one that you spoke to
