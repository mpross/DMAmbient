us  speaker feedback  matt so we are  apparently about to explode were a bunch of professional voice actors working  in video games and animation who also happen to be huge nerds who play dungeons and dragons we began  streaming our campaign about two years in almost a year ago actually were coming up on our  anniversary soon we stream on twitch for geek and /none/ sundry every thursday at 7 pm pacific time we  werent sure if this was going to go anywhere and anybody would like to watch it and well i think  we were very wrong  taliesin apparently its pretty amazing  matt which is great were happy to be here and why not kick this off with some of you guys fan  questions and see the stories roll out from there so dont be afraid to jump in if you have any  random thoughts or ideas you sir the front  audience member yes sir  laura /none/ warn us if youre not up to date  travis you should say if youre current or not  matt were trying to keep spoilers out of this discussion if possible  laura which is going to be hard  audience member im one episode back i didnt get a chance to see thursday but im expecting to  watch it on monday  travis everybody from here over is dead  laughter  audience member dont worry  matt which is really weird for me you kill the dm your game gets a little strange  audience member so /none/ that actually kind of brings up my question about two or three episodes ago  liam said oh well i guess next week were playing shadowrun are we one tpk away from a  different game or are we rolling up new characters and going up next week  laura thats a good question  laughter  matt you know this world of exandria that ive kind of created and theyve kind of helped build  that with their character moments and backstories and such if any characters were to die they  would roll up a new character and /none/ wed incorporate them into the story to then join vox machina going  forward if it was a tpk if i survive the internets backlash we would pick up where the  story left off probably with another band of adventurers to continue the plot from a different  angle in some way  sam what if everyone dies except scanlan could i have my own show thats just me  and you and a triceratops  laughter cheering  sam like a buddy comedy  matt i think you have your answer sorry guys sorry  laura its all /none/ right i understand  matt great question  marisha lean all the way up to the mic  matt the mic is your friend  audience member oh yes indeed what were you guys inspirations for the characters i can tell  a little bit with grog its kind of a conan the barbarian kind of deal what were your inspirations  travis im an idiot so grogs an idiot  laughter  travis the first game that we had was at liam obriens birthday party and matt had given us  classes races all that stuff and i was /none/ like uh i dont want to be an orc ill be a goliath  goliaths are big im big thatll be fun and ill be a barbarian because i suck at math and spells  seem complicated and whatever i didnt even come up with a name and he sat down and he goes  whats your characters name and i was like grog there was a lot of thought that went into  some of these characters  taliesin you were very excited about your boots i do remember that the boots were very intense  he made boots /dung/  travis i made fine leather boots  laura he was so proud of that fact and it has not come into play at all  marisha it has not come into play since he established that  travis nope he makes shitty leather boots thats probably the better way to say that  laura but he thinks theyre fine  marisha i imagine grog has an etsy store in his spare time making boots  travis bootmaiden thats my etsy name  laura i like it  travis inspiration for your characters other inspirations  taliesin mine was based /none/ off of a short story that i had written and never done anything with percy  takes a lot of cues from the movie plunkett and macleane that movie is ridiculous and im so  proud that it exists that and a short story about what the poor jerk who invented the first gun  wouldve been like and what awful circumstances wouldve led to that its changed quite a bit  from there but thats kind of where i came from  laura thats where it started  taliesin it was exciting it was a class id never played /none/ before it was pathfinder  i was curious  laura that very first game though you were something else  taliesin i was a dragonborn paladin  laura our very first game that we played nobody really knew how to play except for matt and  taliesin and liam had played some  taliesin in high school  laura but we all were floundering we had no idea so they brought taliesin as the ringer so if  we got into trouble he could be like i got you covered  taliesin there were several times things just got worse /none/ and worse and worse and i was finally like  okay coming in fixing it all right lets move on  travis he literally came in like doogie howser and just brilliantly solved a puzzle that we were  all nearly about to die from  laura were going to die  travis the look on matts face was like this is first grade and youre all dead already  laughter  taliesin im so glad i dont have to do that dragonborn accent anymore that was so awful  audience member do it  taliesin he was just sort /none/ of heavy and dry and everything he was ugh god awful  travis woohoo  taliesin why  travis its kind of sexy  laughter  sam my character came about because i didnt know anything about dungeons  dragons and i asked liam  whats the dumbest character and he said probably a bard i was like whats the weakest  character he said i dont know like a gnome i went to dungeons  dragons name  generator and thats how i found the name  laura no way  marisha i didnt know that  sam i /none/ totally halfassed it  laughter applause  sam yeah totally just like yeah sure whatever we were going to do it one time it  wasnt important  travis were you hoping to die in one session so you could come back as something  sam well we were all going to just play once for his birthday and that was it so i was like eh  ill just be a dumb character and then it turns out im the best one  cheering laughter  sam im super powerful and awesome i can do anything its amazing who /tavern/ knew and i i get to  sing i love it whatd you say  audience member including crapping on a bed  sam thats right i can crap on beds thats an extra class feature  marisha i had tried the druid in 4th edition and i hated it and i thought druids were useless and  then we did this game and i was like all right yeah i guess ill give druids a shot one more  time this was pathfinder and you could pick a domain kind of like clerics could and i couldnt  decide /none/ between any of the elements so i was like well ill just start with air and ill just make  it my thing to go get all of them and thats how she was born not really out of character  development mainly out of selfish minmaxer shit  laughter  marisha im a huge avatar the last airbender fan  cheering  marisha i didnt mean to make her based off of the last airbender it subconsciously seeped in  and happened that way  laura nice  marisha yeah thats it really  laura i wanted to be /none/ a rogue but liam had already taken rogue and i wanted to be a  halfelf but liam had already taken halfelf then i realized that liam and i actually in real  life share a birthday and so im like what if we were actually twins in the game he loved it and  we went with it i was debating between a ranger and a druid actually i didnt even know for sure  which one i wanted i just emailed matt and i was like i want a pet what class can i have a pet  /none/ with and he said either a druid or a ranger so i went with ranger so i could have trinket  cheering  laura whos wonderful  marisha yes  sam hes the best  laura i just started multiclassing into rogue though because i figure its been long enough i  can start learning the stealthy moves from my brother  travis that was a great question who wears a 2xl here have a jetpack fighter shirt im  giving out stuff when awesome questions are asked  marisha i dont even know where you pulled that from  /none/ taliesin you dont want to know were throwing stuff at everyone  travis goliaths got huge cavities  audience member they said one question matt what comes first the voice or the npc  matt for me its the npc for me the character inspiration for the npc comes from where they fit  in the story where they fit in the civilization what their drives are then i start thinking about  their history then i decide depending on from that point what their racial traits and lifestyle  would lend them to have a specific type of cadence /none/ texture vocal pitch the voice is the  last thing that actually goes to it but i make sure to note next to every npc what the voice type  and dialect is because inevitably theyre going to be pulled out of nowhere its fine if its a home  game and a characters voice changes from session to session but when you have critrolestats  scanning every episode  travis hes got his notepad right now  sam hes taking notes  matt how many character npc inconsistencies has mercer done since episode one lets look at the  /none/ time code  travis hes our court stenographer  matt right i know thats also forced me to kind of step up my game a little bit too you guys  have helped me with that so i go character first voice second and then make notes to remind myself  where that lies  sam then do you choose how many fingers they have  laughter  matt thats only come up recently thats called character progression  laughter  travis oh thats so good  sam soon it will be less than three  matt well played  /none/ taliesin that character came out of nowhere too like that was apparently i just found out that  matt yeah victor wasnt planned victor was an npc that was pulled out of the ether when we were  in vasselheim the first time and percys like im going to go buy some black powder where can  i find that and im like  sam better think quick  matt well lets find out nervous strangled sound like even when he asked whats your  name and i just went victor he was like what was that and i went /none/ in my head i dont  know what did i just say  laughter  matt it sounded kind of like victor victor it is it came out of nowhere so sometimes npcs get  created simultaneously  laura had you created gilmore before we ran into gilmore  matt yes i had designed gilmores glorious goods as part of the abdars promenade in emon  intentionally as one of the characters you might encounter as you went through the city so i was  very glad that he got to have his moment to shine and continue to shine /none/ i wasnt expecting him to  become so central to parts of the story  sam shines so brightly  laura we just love him so much  travis there is no life without gilmore  matt hes a majestic one i only recently realized looking back at the episodes that his  hand is like this he just has a hand at all times hes presentary and then when hes  mmhmm of course its almost like hes holding a fan but theres not one there i dont know  its weird good question  audience member this is /none/ for you for later  matt oh all right  sam okay that was a good question someones getting a tshirt  travis just throw it a hard as you first row  matt youre just hitting that front row man  travis you made it to the first row  sam my arm is spaghetti im a young boy  laura you have little boy arms  travis im a little boy dont hit me  matt yes  audience member heres a question im sure the people at critrolestats would like to know about  its directed at /none/ taliesin as far as the feat you chose for percival weve seen two of the three  choices that youve made for him will we be seeing the third choice  taliesin no youve seen all three  audience member oh really  sam what are they  audience member hex  taliesin hex minor illusion and friends  laura oh thats right  taliesin friends is the third one which i have now used a couple times  sam hums friends theme  taliesin i was about to use it on you if things started getting way too bad /none/ in the shop  travis ah shit  laughter  taliesin i was going to very gently suggest that you just hand everything over to vex and enchant  you to do so i was prepared to  travis i didnt know you could do magic  taliesin thats my money  marisha instead you pulled the amazing minor illusion move  taliesin minor illusion worked out great  travis missed that too  laura i have to say this is the best thing because travis legitimately did not know that  thats what he did  taliesin oh yeah /none/  laura it wasnt a character choice he just didnt know  travis people were like oh travis with the amazing rp playing a character i didnt fucking  notice you guys  laughter  taliesin after the game hes like so what would have happened if id put my hand in the  shadow im like well you would have grabbed the skull then wouldnt you and hes like  no you were so angry  travis matt was gonna give it to me too and i’m like i dont reach in there you with  your stupid shop /none/ water  taliesin i was trying to give you the eye when that was happening like dont do it dont do it  audience member hes super dumb  travis youre all a bunch of dicks  matt good on you  audience member this is as both you as people and as characters its hard because liams not  here but do you guys think that vaxleth is a healthy relationship  laughter  sam is a healthy relationship  laura no not at all  taliesin no  sam no not at all  taliesin theyre like the /none/ two friends in high school who are dating and like this is gonna be  such an explosion  laughter  laura its gonna be so bad  marisha this is the first time im hearing any of this by the way  laughter  marisha so no tell me how bad is it guys tell me lets get it all out right now  taliesin its amazing  laura i just love no wait not everybodys caught up  taliesin do it  marisha spoiler alert if youre not caught up go la la la la la  laura /none/ kashaw showing up in the last episode made me so happy as a person  travis so happy  laura so good and so angry as vex it was wonderful  travis its pretty great  marisha yeah no im starting to get used to it  matt aww  laura im kind of going for it now as vex though  marisha yeah  laura im kind of going for it  marisha i mean we could talk about you and jarett  oohing  sam hes so hot  marisha i actually did not expect that type of /none/ reaction  travis its the crossbow  laura hes pretty wonderful hes pretty wonderful  marisha its a good question dude  taliesin all right good okay xl big xl im going over here  marisha i love our system you have a good question lets give attention to someone else is  that my too much  sam its just pointing over there lets move it up  matt technology  laura oh right because its all over to the side its sliding  audience member so ive been a dm for a little bit and i  sam /none/ quick dm off  laughter  audience member mainly a question for matt but everyone else can help answer it  travis okay well help you  audience member well thank you ive been having troubles with my players actually trying to  roleplay in the games i mean i try setting up the scenarios so its easy for them to do it but  one of them his most creative side is to kill a monster by poking it in the butt  laura laughing thats amazing  marisha thats a method yeah  audience member yes but every /town/ time its not but i  matt and then what happens if he comes back into town and someones like oh look its gerald  the butt poker  laughter  matt all hail the butt poker and he becomes known as the butt poker everywhere then you can  work it in  audience member theres another one that instead of trying to escape a dangerous encounter that i  put him in instead started to roll for a new character while we were playing the game  laughter  audience member so how do i make them  /none/ marisha it sounds like your players have more issues of optimism  audience member  get them more open to the game  matt for them to already be rolling a new character during the encounter means maybe then  want to try a different class which is fine if they want to do that as far as engaging people  to use an old adage you can lead a horse to water a person has to feel comfortable enough to  step out of their comfort zone to try it so you cant force it on them you can /tavern/ try and coax them  into it over time i also find it helps if you engage them as the npc directly if you tell them  you walk into a tavern the barkeeper tells you ah you should buy a room its  different than going he turns to you squeaks the inside of his jar and goes aye miss  what can i do for you you know and just that eye contact it becomes a conversation as opposed  to keeping them in their imagination controlled facet that feels more comfortable it might take  a while you /none/ can talk to your players and be like hey guys itd be cool if we could try and push a  little more into character rp and discussions and dont put any pressure on them for it but help  coax them out by addressing them directly and taking into account that what they say is what  their character says something like oh im not going to talk to this guy be like im sorry  youre not going to talk to who oh i mean i didnt that was him so you can  can play in elements /none/ of that and get them  comfortable with the idea of speaking as  their character not everyone will be and you cant force it  laura im seeing behind the screen right now and its kind of weird to know that thats what  youre doing to us  laughter  sam puppet master  taliesin things just work out better when we actually rp  matt well thats the thing rp circumstances can also have their own rewards too if someone talks  their way out of a good situation theyll get a more profitable circumstance based on /none/ the quest or  mission theyre on they might uncover information that is vital to their current plan and  disposition they may end up unlocking an ally that they didnt have previously these are all  different ways you can reward good rp as well as just a nice little experience bump i keep track  of good character moments and i give little bonus experience points  travis you do not  laughter  taliesin he does do you not read the emails you get like every like oh yeah  travis theres a bunch of numbers in /none/ them  laughter  marisha you realize we get different numbers right  laura we do wait so those are wait wait  marisha we dont get the same  laura do i get extra experience when i  haggle  travis no nobody cares about that  laughter  laura because you never write that in the email that i get extra experience for that  matt that was a great question thank you so much  laughter  travis no damn it oh the door is  closed he doesnt tell us crap  laura nothing  travis /none/ and we try all the time  matt its fun  laura travis texts him all the time  travis i text him when its late maybe hes had a drink maybe hes tired if i had actually  crushed his skull what would have happened and hes like you dont know son of a bitch  laughter  marisha im actually really excited because we have planned as soon as we all eventually die or  if this campaign comes to an end were going to have a party thats us at gods gate and its  just going /none/ to be us asking matt okay that one time that we did this and its just going  to be us asking matt all the questions that weve ever wanted to ask  travis maybe we should just all die now  laura tpk  travis suicide pact  sam you sir whats your question  audience member first if anyone hasnt seen thursdays episode you have to watch it its the  best in a long time  cheering  audience member my question is for matt ive been dming my own campaign for close to a year  /none/ now and my question is about roleplaying specifically roleplaying women going into it im  aware of all these tropes and pitfalls that i can fall into for roleplaying women how do you  approach designing and rping a woman  sam all women talk like this valley girl accent hi oh my god  taliesin you are a master class i swear i feel like a better actor just sitting next to you  matt i actually felt the heat from lauras stare on that one  travis you dont want those dragon eyes  matt its interesting because /dung/ it is a comfort hurdle for a lot of players and dungeon masters  alike to step into the opposite sex you know we have a lot of cultural weirdness in places about  that whole thing and you have to kind of look past that initially i was a theater kid so i  didnt have any shame  cheering  matt woo but also its just like any other person theyre just a person you think of their  wants their needs their fears their drives their goals as a female you consider their place  in the /none/ world is it like our society was fifty years ago where women were almost a secondclass  citizen and are they fighting to make themselves fighting back against the patriarchy are they  heralded as a matriarch is it like lolth spider queen style where the men are just used for  fodder and mating and are slaughtered figure out their power dynamic in society and be comfortable  that its a strong character not necessarily that its a woman that becomes a secondary and  unnecessary facet to it in my opinion  marisha and thats true for storytelling /none/ in general  laura yeah  clapping  matt as far as just distinguishing i had this question earlier how do you change your voice to  be female i dont change my voice that much really theres a difference between chest voice  and head voice you know thinking of the definition it goes up more into your upper palate  and your sinuses and for a man it just takes some of the resonation out of it to where a character  that talks normally in this way can sound a little softer a little more  travis /tavern/ light  matt gently domineering which i really enjoy as a strong female npc allura skirts that line quite  a bit and i like that a lot more than anything it shouldnt be part of a focus you always get  that dumb player who gets asked by the barmaiden can i get you guys a drink and hes like oh  shes a woman well im going to go ahead and slap her on the butt hes about to get pummeled by  the guards in the tavern remember even in these societies sexism probably is not cool /tavern/ and  whoever works at that bar has a lot of friends she works with that are watching her back just saying  audience member all right thank you  matt no worries good question  travis great question  clapping  laura we have no more tshirts  matt hello  audience member theater for life first off  matt yes  audience member i apologize if i ramble because i do that thanks to critical role and things like  wil wheatons tabletop watching people play tabletop games has become very popular more  popular than it has /none/ been previously with tons of twitch shows like critical role actual plays  which are podcasts of people playing dd and things  matt yeah  audience member with all of that are there any secondary versions of critical role actual plays  things like that that you guys enjoy if so what if not would you  sam to watch on our own you mean  audience member to watch or listen to or anything like that you can put it on your phone  as a podcast  sam well for myself i can barely even make the /none/ game that we play  laughter  sam so i dont have a lot of time to veg out and watch other people play and roll dice although i  heard laura was in you both were in titansgrave  laura titansgrave yeah  sam i mean that was cool  laura thanks  laughter  travis and marisha laughing that was cool  laura yeah titansgrave was really fun kurtis wiebe the writer and cocreator of rat queens  cheering  laura they do d20 babes and we did a star wars rpg with kurtis and it was really /none/ really fun and  theyre great people  travis yeah i played a wookie that was great wookie noise  laughter  travis couldnt talk i loved it  marisha and theres always acquisitions inc acquisitions inc has been around forever theyre great  matt yeah thats really great also theres ive enjoyed it for a long time real role play with itmejp  those guys have done phenomenal games for a very long time theres also what was that  laura muffled  matt oh i confused myself also recently the yogscast guys have done high rollers which is /dung/ dmed  by a good friend of mine mark holmes out in the uk and theyre kicking ass as well so those are  a number of the ones that i watch and keep track of both for inspiration and to meet other people  in the community so its cool  sam good question  matt well done  marisha yeah  matt your quest is fantastic  marisha next question  audience member hello  marisha hello  audience member i have a question thats a little more specific than these other ones it has to do with /none/  the very first critmas special where toward the end marisha got an incharacter letter from pike  which included a psalm that was in celestial and i was wondering if you ever got it translated  marisha to decipher the letter that i got from pike that was written in celestial  audience member yeah  marisha you know its still on my todo list  audience member i have a translation for you  marisha im sure its a wonderful lovely message  taliesin she owes me breakfast so this doesnt surprise me  marisha true  laura /none/ did you write it  marisha was that you  audience member i brought the translation with me so you dont have to do the work  applause  matt thats awesome i was surprised too because she took celestial for three years in college  laughter  matt she should have it  travis eat more chicken  sam thats a lot of cursing  taliesin dont call it a comeback ive been here for years  marisha im going to cry if i read it  travis dont read it  marisha okay keep going  audience member /dung/ so im the dungeon master for our current group and ive noticed on critical  role that whenever you guys roll a one its just an automiss and you guys dont have a  fumble chart or anything for the ones i was wondering if that was something specifically for  the show or if you as a dungeon master dont like using them or what was up with that or if there  is just enough pain in the game as it is  matt right  sam what is he saying what translate i dont play dungeons and /none/ dragons i dont know what hes  talking about  laughter  matt in older editions in some variations if you were to roll a natural one it wasnt just an auto  miss it was  travis you died  matt you had to roll on a chart to see what horrible thing happened to you for rolling so poorly  sam oh okay  matt which is really fun for my games i consider the natural one more of a narrative  failure i like to explain the visual aspect of why you failed so much and in /none/ some cases its  more of a shame than an actual more of a mechanical horrible blunder  marisha its always a shame always shame  matt and partially because ive played games where people use those charts and theyre like  all right you go to attack the orc critical fail you accidentally cut off your  own head and im like really how is that no  sam how would you ever do that  marisha yeah what was the con we were at this past weekend and the guy was telling a story  about that and /none/ he rolled to just gently kick his friend awake just kind of nudging his friend  awake and so the dm made him roll for it and he rolled a nat one  matt natural 20  marisha oh it was a natural 20  matt he was like roll a strength check and im like to kick your friend awake  laura he kicked his head off  marisha he kicked his head off  laughter  marisha youre 100 right he kicked his head off and i was like thats harsh thats like way harsh  laura thats /none/ bullshit  marisha you just got punished for a nat 20  laura thats not okay  travis thats great  laughter  matt so yeah i think its a cool system if you want to incorporate it i tried it for years for  certain things and it has its merits definitely i felt for our game i like to make the fumbles  more of a narrative failure than an actual mechanical failure because then it can get a  little too weird and really really bite you back  audience member i gave them the choice and /none/ they chose the sheet  matt well fair enough and that is entirely their call  taliesin heads will roll  matt let them burn  sam yes sir  audience member hello this question is not so much about dd as it much as it is about your  careers in general and kind of just a fun question entirely but if you could steal one role  from one of your colleagues like for example if travis wanted to steal the role of krom from matt  or if marisha wanted to steal the role of maka from /none/ laura would you do it and who would you take  laura stealing a role from somebody else  audience member yeah if you wanted to voice somebody that one of these people  sam a voice role  audience member would you do it like who would it be  laura oh man  marisha i dont know if ive thought about it  laura i mean ellie shes not here but ellie from the last of us  taliesin id steal ellie  laura thats an amazing character but the thing is i can say ellie hey  /none/ applause  marisha best con ever  laura i can say ellie from the last of us but she wouldnt be that character she wouldnt be that  amazing if ashley hadnt played her  marisha yeah i kind of agree with laura its almost hard to say because the actors bring so  much of the characters themselves that it just wouldnt be the same  travis yeah i agree  marisha but i guess if i had to pick one thor i want thor  travis you can have him  marisha tell that to marvel  taliesin /none/ ill take black widow if you take thor  laura hey i like that  marisha all right yeah  sam i mean i have a terrible nasal voice i would love to have some of travis sack  travis ill trade you my sack for your beer  sam youve got beer  travis thats not enough  laughter  sam you maam  audience member hi first of all i am dressed as vexahlia today  applause  sam oh wow  marisha oh shit i just realized it took me half a second dope  audience member /dung/ first of all matt thank you so much because i have wanted to dungeon master for  years and years and im finally doing it  applause  audience member im starting a pathfinder game next week and im just so thankful for all the tips  and tricks and stuff you put online i am so thankful  matt thank you i hope they help and theres a lot of great communities online too far before i  put anything up there that expand upon these tips as well so dont be afraid to reach out to  the /none/ reddit dd page and the rpg check out all those guys  audience member that being said last year i touched wil wheaton and my rolls have been really shitty  matt oh no im so sorry  audience member so do you have any things that i can do to cleanse the wil wheaton  matt we can try but understand its a very strong curse  taliesin the sage helped the sage helped a lot  audience member ill just get a selfie with taliesin and itll be fine im sure  taliesin i specifically had sage powdered /none/ in dragons blood it was really intense  audience member okay ill try that too  taliesin not kidding  matt step forward step forward  sam singing  taliesin singing  travis wow wow  laura youre officially the little mermaid congratulations  matt shes going get real angry when it doesnt work  marisha shes even got the vex swagger going  sam you sir man with the beer  audience member laura youre getting a beer right  sam the beers really good  travis its really hoppy and delicious  audience member my questions for you /none/ matt how the heck do you come up with all the names for the  places around the world thats the problem im having because im trying to create a game just  naming places is my problem  matt naming convention is interesting ive always liked making up weird names anyway and a  lot of times ill just start thinking of it starts with letters that havent been used very  often in other areas so ill be like all right i made a stillben so thats an s name so i dont  want to make another /town/ s named town nearby so ill go w westruun kinda came from just trying to  think of its to the west of where the main city will be expansion sent it west and then from  that point i started taking inspiration from different languages that would affiliate that area  a lot of norse language works near vasselheim looking into root words and certain spelling  techniques in other languages and jamming things together that sound interesting and roll off the  tongue well  sam what you do is you pick your middle name and the street /none/ you grew up on and your pet name  and thats the name  matt and theres also really good name generators online for fantasy locations that you can go ahead  sam smug clicking  matt worked out well for some folks but yeah just pull inspiration from books that you like  campaigns that already exist source books if you have them and take pieces from certain words that  you like and jam them together and see if it sounds nice when you say it thats all you really need  travis name all your characters percy /none/  matt all of them  sam percival de rolo de momo  marisha frederick von  taliesin singing its delightful its delectable its delovely  sam next question please  travis wait vex wants to try  laura no ive had some ale  audience member i heard that hi i have some bracelets for you guys i dont really have a  question im going to give these to you guys im representing extra life we raise money for  doernbechers and we raise money for children who are sick terminally and i just want to give you /none/  some bracelets  matt that is awesome  travis applaud this woman  applause  matt thank you so much  travis thats great  taliesin yes thank you  travis thank you  laura thank you so much  matt i want to take a minute while were talking about this actually one of the really amazing  things to come out of this community aside from the perpetual beer  travis seriously best panel ever  sam yeah this is the best panel ever  travis a bit of advice write ale into your backstory bitches because /none/ hey  sam hey also dont write poop into your backstory because people send me poop all the time  marisha i love that if we wait for like ten minutes one will just appear theyre spawning  matt thats real magic to take a minute off that topic one of the so many amazing things have  sprung out of this community more than we ever could have expected or hoped but one of the things  that perpetually humbles and blows me away is the generosity of all of you guys supporting all these  wonderful charities all /none/ these wonderful causes you guys communally have raised so much money and  so much awareness to so many amazing largely overlooked in a lot of cases charitable intents  and its incredible so give yourselves a huge round of applause  travis yeah seriously you guys are amazing  applause  marisha we are literally changing the world with dd  laura its crazy its so amazing that you guys have done so much and that critmas is  the most amazing thing and the gifts that you guys send are so wonderful but the fact that you guys /none/  are donating to other people and doing good in the name of this community is so freaking amazing  marisha ultimately the whole reason we even did this show was to share it out with other people  and to share the joy that is dd and gaming its just even more of a compliment and an honor to  hear you guys paying it forward and to continue to spread the gospel that is the players handbook  laughter  travis the gospel  matt you sir  audience member my question is for matt how do keep /none/ your homebrew classes blood hunter witch  hunter kind of stuff how do you work to keep those balanced without making them totally crap or way overpowered  matt homebrew classes and races is a new thing to me as well like i never really created the  first real homebrew thing was just the transition of your gunslinger over from pathfinder and even  that took a while just testing and figuring it out learning to balance something homebrew on  that degree especially a new class or a new archetype its something that comes with  experience and /none/ with community feedback while im happy that im somewhat decent at dd theres so  many great communities out there that are far more knowledgeable of how the games original design  construct was based on what is considered good versus bad balance when i threw my stuff out  thereit was to the wolves in a way because everyone was like this is broken this messed up  and im like cool thank you for telling me that now i can go back and fix it how about now this  is oh this is better now internet may /none/ be angry and forceful sometimes with its feedback but as  long as its still constructive and its awesome which most of the community is thats a  tremendous source for you to use theres the unearthed arcana reddit is a whole area thats all  about homebrew dd content and theyre all very knowledgeable and very willing to help you with  feedback on your own homebrew ideas  audience member awesome thank you  matt thank you  audience member howdy folks my question is actually for portland like a survey so im going  to need some /none/ help here  marisha for portland  audience member yeah  marisha all right all the way into the mic  audience member so ill need a some help here like the survey but im thinking we have scanlan shorthalt  right here can we please tell him that trinket should always go with the party  laura yes  cheering  audience member yes trinket  laura dont you shake your head you mother i saw some of you shaking your damn head  travis i heard a boo  laura i heard a boo  marisha i know /none/  laura how dare you  sam if portland thinks so who am i to argue with that trinket is just an unstoppable force of  power grace  laura he has saved he has done some serious  sam when he  taliesin i had to put my coat somewhere last episode that was very important  sam when he saves me i will respect him  laura he did save you didnt he  sam no  marisha i think so i think he did like once  matt when critrolestats shakes his head no  laughter  /none/ travis the human encyclopedia says no  laura wait okay but you know how many times has trinket killed anybody  audience member he bit a vampires head off  sam one  laura he bit a vampires freaking head off  sam three  laura three killings  travis yeah nine times  audience member inaudible  marisha hey hey hes gotten two how do you want to do this  sam and ive killed at least that many listen trinket is great  taliesin youre almost as useful as a bear  laughter and cheering  travis i /none/ think it just needs to be solved pvp scanlan versus trinket  sam yeah i would do that  laura no that would be so sad  taliesin we could make a lot of money bear wrestling  laura trinket only has 60 hit points you guys  travis yeah but what if he gets lucky  taliesin gnome versus bear  laura so thats why i dont send him in hes only got 60 hit points so if he dies then he dies  and i dont know what i would do  travis yall this is truth the /none/ one time before the stream when i smacked the bear on the ass and  sent it through this minefield i almost got divorced like legitimately  laura i dont know what i love is when we were fighting the dragon at our keep and he got frozen  this was out of character im looking at travis going youd better fucking save  travis ive got to save that fucking bear because if he dies theres no joy in the world  laughter  laura i feel like that was the one time grog really acted out of character /none/ when he saved trinket  travis she would walk home and all the flowers in the front yard would die save that bear man  rule number one  sam im just saying that a ferret or even a goldfish  travis what is this hogwarts or an owl or a cat  laura if i could take the spell polymorph if i could have that fucking spell i would be so  happy i hate that anytime i want to bring trinket and were stealthing or something like that and  im like marisha  marisha hopefully ive got /none/ it  laura can you use one of your spells that you have a limited amount of to polymorph my bear  taliesin that red panda was pretty awesome  marisha i can turn him into a red panda thats generally all i care about  sam i can always do that and i never will  laughter  marisha its true its true he always has it  matt dont be sad gnome be happy gnome  laura you motherfucker you could do it  travis okay okay okay rosie  audience member first of all thank you laura /none/ for rolling a nat one on my die earlier while i was  in beauty and the beast on the opening night gastons wig fell off and i was wondering if you  guys ever had any embarrassing moments on stage  marisha yeah every episode lets cut to the eight times between laura and i that weve been  like we just sobbing oh god oh god this is crying i mean that counts  matt do you mean during the show or do you mean legitimately on a theatrical stage  audience member on a theatrical stage  /none/ matt okay so an actual stage show  marisha oh  taliesin oh yeah  laura yes  sam i was in les miserables as a child i played gavroche  matt and where did you play it  sam you know in broadway  laughter  sam i did a national tour and i was performing in miami it was a long time ago like 89 or  something  anyway i fell onstage and i injured my knee and i was taken to the hospital long  story but i was wearing rags and dirt and stuff and /none/ i was brought to the hospital and it just so  happened that in miami that night there were riots martin luther king day riots or something  so they brought me in this little boy this little white boy and they were like why are you  here and i was like i fell off the barricade  laughter  sam and they were like theres a barricade were you protesting and i was like i mean i guess  travis viva la revolución  sam so they thought i was the youngest civil rights protester ever  travis /none/ little french boy  matt thats amazing  marisha id never heard that  matt i dont think any of us can top that  travis please tell me theres a getty images of that somewhere  sam i wish  matt good question when i knocked over an inkwell during a production of the crucible as  reverend hale i slammed the table during the trial for the latter half of the play and whoever  was being the clerk of the court had filled the inkwell with ink which he wasnt supposed to do  but he wanted /none/ to write legitimately i slammed the table and it blurp and spills out all  over my hand i look down out of the corner of my eye and its just like blue ink across my hand  and im trying to hide it so someone else starts talking and danforth whos the guy running the  whole trial starts getting really angry and i raise my finger to point ink all up his white  shirt across his face he feels it and he doesnt know what it is he just knows hes got  something on his face /none/ so he goes and tries to rub off the spittle and theres this giant ink  smear across his face none of us could tell him so he did most of the second half of the play just  with giant ink smears on his face yeah  sam thats pretty good  matt theater  laura oh man in high school i was doing this play and this guy that i had the biggest crush on  ever was sitting in the front row i had one of those hoop skirts on and i sat down on the couch /none/  and i wasnt used to them the hoop went up over my head and it was like a dress rehearsal so i  didnt have the full costume on so it was just like underwear so it was just like hoop and  panties and i was mortified  travis yes  laura to inaudible audience member no he was never my boyfriend  travis are you sure  laura i am sure  marisha its like a skin you can download in portal its great  laura i also did a production of joseph and the amazing technicolor /none/ dreamcoat and i was playing  the narrator and i was running out on stage  travis and you ate shit  laura i did i ate shit as i was running out leading the entire chorus out to do this big dance  number for go go go joseph and my foot caught in my skirt i just planted it on the stage  and slid and then had to get up and finish the dance out  taliesin i got beat up by a goat on camera once  laughter  taliesin it was some show called hell /town/ town it only went like 12 episodes and i was some  autistic kid who befriends a goat that goat was not friendly that goat just jumped me and nailed  me in the face i was cut it was just bad it was a little goat but i was a little kid and it was  like finally a human i can beat the fuck out of  travis why have we not killed a goat in the game as vengeance for your reallife  taliesin ive already taken care of that  marisha i guess the best one /none/ that i have its hard to top gavroche i was in a production of the  nutcracker and i was a soldier we had to come through the flat on the stage and we had these  hats that came down and we were soldiers and i missed the entrance and slammed into the flat  anyone who does theater you know these flats are made out of cardboard so the whole thing went  shaking noise and almost fell over  laura oh but it didnt  marisha it didnt fall over but  laura could have been worse /none/  marisha it was very obvious that i smacked into a flat the entire section  travis i burned down a theater and killed everybody inside  sam oh wow  travis but nobody knows about that so  matt we should go now you should okay next question  audience member im commander shepard and this is my favorite show on the citadel  laura nice  audience member no serious dm question here as a dm who has a party of some odd races a mouse  a fire genasi and soon to be a tiefling your game /town/ has a goliath travis you can help me with  this one as well your game has a goliath who seems to have a history as a marauder  to put it nicely  travis a what  sam a marauder  travis a marauder thats a big word  audience member so did that ever have any role play issues early on you have this big goliath  walking around town that used to be wandering around in the fields robbing people beating  people up stuff like that  matt it was interesting because his father had actually /none/ left his tribe his band theyre  basically just like wildliving savage bandits that destroyed and pillaged whatever came in their  territory his father had separated from them after his early trials and made a name of himself  in the city of westruun as a respectable individual thats how when he went and met pike  there wasnt people were not comfortable with him in the city and stayed away from him but  there was no all of a sudden immediate force of the local guard going like i dont trust you  were going to lock /none/ you up and cut your face so that wasnt a huge issue but the band is still  out there  taliesin we ran into  matt you did run into them once it was a largescale battle with all these goliaths jumping  out and the party was like we are so ruined the fight was about to go and i think it was the  first time that ive ever had grog stop fighting and socially talk the party out of battle grog  taliesin it was amazing  travis it turned out to be one of my /none/ cousins which goes into a backstory thing that will  probably come up at some point but i didnt want to fight my family because we would have probably  all died it was like seven goliaths  laura we probably yeah  travis it would have been bad  taliesin it was a while ago  travis but he gets one pass and then hes dead  audience member as it should be  sam you sir  audience member first things first scanlan as a bard you are a huge hero and inspiration to myself  cheering  /none/ sam i know  travis dont tell him that can we get a bigbys hand  sam sings bigbys hand  applause  sam its not even a bard spell  matt i know  audience member as characters vox machina do you consider yourselves to be heroes do you  actively try to be heroes  marisha youre asking us as vox machina  sam i mean  audience member youve done some pretty horrible things  laura we have done some pretty terrible things  sam collectively we are heroic  taliesin yes collectively  sam individually i /none/ dont think scanlan thinks of himself as a god that doesnt really need to prove  anything hes just in it for the lols for the most part but i think collectively weve done  some good things weve saved civilization  laura weve done some terrible things too  sam weve rescued people and weve killed old people which is always a good thing for society  laughter  taliesin percys kind of starting to figure out that hes not that great a person but  travis laughs  taliesin i knew but percy didnt know but at the /none/ same time its mostly because hes  acknowledging that were all kind of awful people but together except for pike pikes great  pikes fine but together were actually a powerful force for good individually not so much  travis grog lives moment to moment i have no idea what theyre talking about  laura i feel like vax is a really good person vax is probably outside of pike  marisha vax is probably the best person vax is probably most selfless  laura yeah because he really is in it to  taliesin percy would have words about /none/ that  laura oh really  taliesin oh yeah  laura has he done some shit i feel like im speaking for liam now  travis yeah you cant rp for vax  laura i cant speak for liam but based on conversations that weve had  travis why dont you speak for yourself  marisha yeah we dont really have these conversations we try and keep it for the game  travis is this meta right now  taliesin this is meta  matt roll initiative  laughter  marisha are we going to get shat on for metagaming /none/  laura ah  matt i dont know  travis were all going to die you killed us  laura were all going to die  taliesin way to go  sam i will tell you this though scanlan is a bit of an existentialist and for a specific  reason thinks or has thought up to now that life is sort of pointless  laura aww  taliesin i see that  laura look at this guy  marisha its interesting actually all the different ideals our characters have evolved  travis yeah ideals  laughter  laura i /none/ get sometimes people online saying ive done something thats really terrible  travis theyre right  laura but for vex the motivation makes sense it makes sense the reason she would do certain things  travis oh sure  laura and its not bad in her eyes its not  marisha everyone loves to comment on if keyleth did something right or wrong everyone seems to  have an opinion and once again people need to understand where keyleth is coming from  laura keyleth is the worst of all of us  taliesin oh yeah by far she killed /none/ a kid  marisha im the evil bastard  laura heart of ice  marisha honestly like legitimately keyleth has probably done some of the worst stuff thats also  trying the hardest so it just really messes with her psyche  travis its my favorite part  marisha its true im the worst i try so hard  taliesin its not that were not heroes its that were flawed were flawed people  marisha were extremely flawed everyones broken  travis were a bunch of idiots come on  marisha we have no fucking clue what were doing ever /none/  matt weve got about five minutes left  sam two more questions maybe  matt if there are two or three we can get through quickly  travis bless you can we name an npc after him or something  taliesin hes just going to get killed in five minutes  travis just make him the beer delivery guy  sam dean is your next npc  travis weve got to build him a room  cheering  travis excitedly beer wench  laura you guys were seriously going to be so not functional  taliesin this is going /none/ to slow down the autograph lines so much theres going to be so many  misspellings and typos  travis were going to sign one letter at a time  laura if we spell your name wrong later  travis yes go for it weve got five minutes  marisha do you want my leftover one  matt she gives me the halfdrunk one  audience member first i want to thank yall yall are the reason my wife and i play dd  together now so thank you for that secondly as a dm of seven players so i /none/ feel that pain a  little bit as players is there anything yall have ever wanted to do in game but have thought  no that would eat up too much time theres eight of us we need to get the story moving  along or do yall just nope everyone can wait and im going to have my twohour moment  taliesin i try and have my attack plan ready for when its my turn to fight  marisha yeah  taliesin i dont start looking at the board when its like all right youre up no okay im /none/ good  travis i feel like matt does a pretty good job too of being clairvoyant and sensing that if we  start to do something thats going to go way off on a tangent and take up too much time hell cut  it off the second we start it and hell bring something up that puts us back on  a more cohesive track  sam but he also allows us to go on our little individual journeys when we need to  matt its a fun little exploration element  travis thats where the black powder guy /none/ came from is some random tangent most  amazing npc ever  taliesin he put the fear into me because he said i was going to run out of bullets and powder  soon i was like oh god youre right and i didnt know what to do about that  travis and then you cast friends on me you dick  laura i always feel slightly guilty any time we have a shopping excursion  audience member because that can eat up time with even four players let alone seven or eight  laura exactly and not only because /none/ its probably boring for the other players but i feel like its  really boring for you guys to watch us go buy potions  travis shoppings awesome i love going shopping with other people  laughter  matt it can be fun its about knowing as a gm when to edit a scene you can let things happen  let it be fun let interactions occur and then once you feel like the goal of that scene has been  completed or is close to resolution you can nudge the party and be like all right so from this /none/  point where do you want to go from here or as time passes you continue the transaction you  can find a point where the fun has been had the major arc of that moment has hit and you can help  hurry and bookend and then continue the next moment  sam thats the hardest thing to do in improv is to both be in the scene and know when the scene is  over thats super hard  marisha and were also a bunch of a personalities so sometimes you have to fight if  you want /none/ to have a moment if you want to have something you have to not be afraid to jump in  and youve probably seen a hundred times where some of us have started to do something and then  it might have gotten cut off and then you have to let it go you move on just like in life  sometimes it is not the right time or the right place  sam what were saying is you should sit down now  audience member thats more deep than what i wanted  matt weve got time for probably /none/ one or two more fast questions if we dont get to your questions  here youre welcome to come and ask us at our signing later  laura and we also have a panel tomorrow  matt we also have a panel tomorrow at noon  laura not here in room c123  travis c123 tomorrow and were at our tables when were not here were at our tables  the whole time  audience member how hard was it to transition the gunslinger from pathfinder over to what you guys  do because for one of the games im /none/ a part of my girlfriend wants to be a dracomancer and i didnt  realize that was in 4e so im having trouble helping her get it up to this one  matt thats a tough one for me the archetypes especially for fighter and combatbased  archetypes its much more cut and dry as far as the transition for natural physics a gunslinger  we know how ballistics work and some of the possible tropes for gunslingers in modern media  so that was an easy inspiration to transition and change some of the things and still make it /none/  interesting when you get into stuff like that where youre dealing with more obtuse magics and  other creatures that are mythological if youre having a hard time reach out to a community of  homebrewers like the unearthed arcana guys and ask for suggestions there there may be things  that are already existing that are a good root or basis that you can then tweak more into what you  want your final homebrew to be and now theres the dms guild which allows everyone to put up  their own homebrew stuff online and theres a /none/ lot of great content there that you can find people  with and if you like it you can toss them a couple of bucks and show them how much you  appreciate it i think its really cool that theyve opened up the community to create their  own homebrew content and provide it like that  taliesin for safety how many revisions have you given me  matt the gunslinger probably close to eight at this point  taliesin about eight  travis one more question  matt thank you very much  marisha i hope its a /none/ good one  matt come by later on and well get to your guys questions later on  travis because everybody from here over has to pee so bad  marisha so bad weve drank three beers in an hour  travis we had a whole cask of ale from here over  audience member my question is a personal question for matt so im sorry its not a whole  group question im just so curious youve inspired me to start writing again and to start  playing dd im really nervous and to remember to myself to be /dung/ who i want to be and to start  writing again i bought my wristband because i watch you i see you you wear yours constantly  mine i got nauticalthemed since my husbands in the navy its got a ship wheel and a kraken i  wondered do yours have any significance you wear them constantly do they mean anything  matt thats a very interesting question they do actually each wristband i keep on me not just  from a visual standpoint but each has a very specific meaning this first wristband here was  actually gifted to /none/ me by somebody in the middle of the desert at my first burning man and its a  representation of personal responsibility and understanding where i came from and where i want  to go and make sure that i dont stray from that path and be true to myself its a long story  where it got that meaning but thats essentially what it means  this one here was actually granted to me by my best friend brittany wallach for my birthday many  years ago thats her right there  cheering  matt this represents friendship and /dung/ the people that have held me in my dark times and got me to  where i am today because honestly no individual gets there its a bunch of people that bring you  to your final fated future thank you brittany and this band here if you get a chance to look  it has a bunch of numbers printed into it this was made by marisha for our anniversary a few  years ago she dyed the leather she printed in the numbers and these numbers represent the  actual coordinates of the beach where we had our /tavern/ first kiss  audience aww  sam gross  matt i know right so yeah each of these have a very special significance to me and are constant  reminders of good moments and people in my life  audience member thank you so much  matt thank you it was a good question  travis great question  sam this was a fun panel matt you did great moderating  laura youve been awesome  sam im drunk  matt good  cheering  matt and you guys did a great job making that happen  cheering  travis /none/ we love that you guys are here so we will be at the group signing table at 400 from 400  to 500 well be there its a short run so if we dont get to everybody thats okay well be over  at our tables until the close of the day and then well be back here when the hall opens tomorrow  as well we have another panel and a group signing tomorrow as well thank you so much for coming out  matt thank you so much  marisha thank you guys we have to pee because
