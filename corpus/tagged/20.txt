none	 matt hello everyone and welcome to tonights episode of critical role where a bunch of us  nerdyass voice actors sit around and play dungeons  dragons before we dive into tonights  episode we have some announcements to get through so hang tight for just a moment we have  two fantastic sponsors for tonights episode the first of course our fantastic returning friends  and allies in this campaign two dd beyond sam  sam dd beyond everybody its almost thanksgiving time and i thought what better for  us to do than to thank our longtime sponsor 
none	 dd beyond theyve been with us all campaign we hope  into the next year so as a token of our appreciation we put together a highlight reel of  all my best moments from all the best dd beyond ads of the year so roll that clip gentlemen and  were going to hold on ive just been handed something okay im being told that we dont have  that clip which is disappointing because we had meetings about this all week i talked to editors  about this and this was important to me and to okay sorry 
none	 okay im being told that we did not  have meetings all week about this and this is a bit that i wrote about an hour ago needless to  say i feel like dd beyond is going to not like this because weve taken them on this  rollercoaster of emotions now and theyre going to be pretty pissed off they may pull their  sponsorship dollars okay now im being told that no they will not pull their sponsorship  dollars because they really just want me to read the ad copy that they provided me two days 
dung	 ago so  ill just read that now and theyll be happy as a reminder from last week dungeon of the mad mage  and the magic the gathering dd crossover guildmasters guide to ravnica are available now  in the dd beyond marketplace be sure to pick up yours at dndbeyondcommarketplace okay fine so  maybe theyre a great company but i feel like theyre going to resent me for i am being told  that no theyre not going to resent me at all and in fact they have a promo code named after me  the promo 
none	 code is samisourhero not case sensitive it can be used right now for 25 off  all digital books including those two books i just mentioned earlier so go to the store right  now and use it okay forget about dd beyond all right the fans will be pissed off at me right  they will think that im an awful human being theyll drag my name on reddit im being told  now that theres nothing written on any of these pieces of paper and this is just a thinlyveiled  attempt to get attention to myself because 
none	 i am very insecure i have these deepseated problems  and im being told now that im actually pretty happy and i dont have any deepseated depression  or anything like that and im a pretty good guy wow i really think guys that this bit has been  a journey for all of us and i feel like weve all learned something about ourselves and about  nope im being told we have not learned anything and that im to wrap it up so back to you matt  matt thank you sam  travis were going to recycle 
tavern	 all those papers right  matt yes may you enjoy your everfuture in race car beds thank you dd beyond for being our  friends and allies in this our secondary sponsor tonight is the fantastic company thinkfuns  shadows in the forest game for those who havent seen it this is the reimagining of the classic  game waldschattenspiel i know i pronounced it terribly but thinkfun licensed it maybe  shadows in the forest is the only collaborative board game that you actually play in the dark in  the game you play as shadowlings theyre these scattered 
none	 gnomishlike creatures that hide in the  shadows and live in the forest and its really cool you all have to work together to try and  meet under a singular tree on the board while one of the players plays as a lantern an actual  physical lantern that gives off light and so you can only move within the shadows and if the  player moves the light  sam that sounds awesome  matt its really cool  taliesin i brought a copy actually i forgot to bring it out onto the table but i have a 
none	 copy  that well probably play  matt its really cool because if youre playing one of the shadows and youre caught in the light  you cant move and if the person whos playing the light manages to catch all the shadowlings in  the light they win but if all the shadowlings manage to meet under there it actually uses  marisha they did a creepy animation for a promo thats during the break  taliesin its got little standup trees and the little creatures are very miyazakilooking and  the whole things got a very candyland for 
none	 goth kids vibe the dice glow which i also think is  really cool  matt its pretty fun so you can check it out on amazon and its currently at 20 off there for a  limited time so make sure to pick up your copy now if you plan to it is shadows in the forest  and it is awesome and im really excited to try it out next up lets see travis do you want to go  ahead and talk a little bit about operation supply drop  travis yes operation supply drop is my

none	 are ever creative last we left off the mighty nein  garbage wine  liam garbage wine  sam water  matt the mighty nein had made their way to the menagerie coast got swept up in a bunch of chaos  and found themselves out at sea amongst the swavain islands taken in by a pirate crew  captained by captain avantika basically at threat of death otherwise sent to an island to  investigate a temple learn about seals that possibly are keeping your patron ukotoa at bay  made your way back across the lucidian ocean towards 
none	 the city of darktow actually actively  partook in some piracy  sam yeah  travis polite piracy  matt polite piracy sure  taliesin you got a participant trophy  matt whatever it takes to help you sleep at night and found yourselves at the pirate city of  darktow surrounded by the dragshallow reef where you had just arrived with both ships the  squalleater and the mistake the crew you had hired out of nicodranas looking very confused and  concerned at their current fate given the fact they were just hired hands at sea you were 
none	  ushered up along the sheer cliffs alongside darktow isle a long stone shelf within the cavern  where the plank king himself greeted you bid you entry to the revelry this extending band of  pirates across this part of the ocean laid some ground rules and sent you on your way and that is  where we left off mighty nein as you descend the raincovered stone steps that descend down the  side of the cliffs hows that for alliteration in a phrase making your way towards the  nowdarkened evening city of darktow the distant glimmers 
town	 of interior firelight slightly emanating  from open windows you can see folks walking through town the light drizzle threatening to  stifle the low torchlight being carried from location to location you can see the outline of  dozens of ships that are locked into the shipyard that surrounds the city as well as the crooked  outline of nearby barricades set up across the reefs that surround the island avantika proceeds  before you what would you like to do  sam whispers shoot her in the back of the head  laura whispers we could totally push 
tavern	 her off the cliff right now  sam oh  marisha whispers ukotoa  travis yeah so the group is us plus avantika and  marisha her crew  matt no just avantika her crew went to the bloated cup which is a tavern  marisha and were headed there  matt correct you assume youre headed back there  liam pirate on pirate violence is verboten  laura she just slipped  liam thats true  sam i saw it  marisha she fell down the stairs you guys  travis night time right sun has gone down  
none	 matt correct  travis okay  marisha i catch up to her a little bit hey avantika  matt yes  marisha weird question  matt possibly a weird answer  marisha how much do you know how do you know how to give a certain amount to avantika sorry  the plank king freudian slip  matt well when we return into the bay we are to essentially give the materials or at least a  number of what weve managed to acquire we are supposed to essentially what is the word im  looking for what is the 
none	 word im looking for  sam tithe  matt tithe i would say youre going through customs and you have to  all declare  matt declare thank you you must declare the amount of which you have recently come upon and  from that there is a tithe offer to the plank king roughly about 2530 but we do not pay for  our ship repairs we have free asylum here within the island and we are under the strict law that  if anyone doublecrosses anyone else within the bounds of the city they will have the hammer 
none	 of  the plank king down upon them  marisha its very intense  matt that is the way of life  marisha so its less like a government and more of a union that you buy into  matt more or less yes theyre not much into governing more just  marisha like a union with a dictator  matt a union with a very hardheaded and forthright union leader  marisha hmm do you ever think you could make a good union leader  matt nah i have my own specific interests theyre much more narrow  marisha 
none	 huh  matt why do you have aspirations  marisha no  matt i didnt think so  marisha who needs aspirations  matt well some of us do there has to be more to you than just this  contradictoryforthesakeofbeingcontradictory aspect eh  marisha i would love for you to tell me about it someday  matt come lets have a drink huh first rounds on me  marisha deal  sam singing everyones fucking avantika  liam you are going to judge me for finger motions hold on everybody stop the game laura  bailey just shamed me 
none	 for a sexual finger motion at this table after three and a half  motherfucking years i have seen everything resume the game  travis avantika is the infinity gauntlet and she has one stone  laughter  travis or does she  matt well she lost a stone technically  taliesin well we should take a look around maybe get a sense of this place since were going  to be here for a while when they fix the ship i have a few things im looking for  marisha might as well go to the pub  taliesin 
none	 we could do that sure i guess  marisha first drinks on her  laura i think that guy was wearing a wig  sam oh yes he did have a weird hairline right  laura yeah it was a really badmade wig i mean the hair looked good but it was really obvious  sam maybe thats in fashion here maybe we should all go wig shopping  laura ooh  sam just saying  travis captain how did the current plank king get to the position that he holds now do you know  matt as far as 
none	 i have been told at the very least this was before my time joining the  revelry there was a disagreement and the previous plank king seemed to be in the minority  of the side of this disagreement and the current plank king was in the majority so they stormed  the caverns of the previous plank king and tossed most of his corpse to the rocks below  travis a little mutiny eh did hmm interesting no thats all  matt to his credit the current plank king has done a very fine job of maintaining organization  
none	 in the revelry  travis thats what i was going to ask if you were a fan or not  matt he doesnt bother me he leaves us well enough alone we follow the rules we maintain  all of the benefits of being under the banner and im left to my own devices  travis any foes of yours in this darktow anyone we should look out for  matt there are a number of unsavory types but ive made a bit of a reputation of being a  little eh people dont like to tangle with that too 
none	 much eh  travis yeah why would you get wrapped up in that yeah lets go grab a drink  marisha and sam mmhmm  laura how long have you been a pirate  matt lets see open on the seas about 12 13 years  laura whoa  liam how did you fall into it  matt i got sick of following somebody elses orders  liam where do you hail from  matt ill tell you over drinks this is not the best place to have these discussions eh perhaps  after a few rounds come to the 
none	 bloated cup  sam the bloated cup  travis yep we go  matt as you guys finish descending the stairs into the city itself you catch there are quite a  few patrols through the city you can see the torchlight being held by each as they make their  way just keeping an eye out you get the sense that theres probably quite a number of  volunteers or at least individuals that are intent on maintaining the semblance of civility  here within darktow itself leading close towards the bloated cup its not that far from where 
tavern	 you  had set your ship within the shipyard its a fairly large twostory tavern very wide across  its bottom and seems to be at least one of maybe two social gathering sites here within the city  once the sun goes down three blocks away you can already hear the music chatter laughter and  yelling as you approach closer begin to look from the outside in the warm light and the  movement of shadows across the open windows shows you that the place is pretty jampacked as you  begin to make your way into following 
none	 avantika to the interior you hear the shouting and  burbling and clinking of glasses as the far corner has five or six individuals youre not sure if  theyre paid musicians or just sailors who happen to have a bit of experience with a fiddle a drum  and a flute of some kind as the music begins to play you can see there is one table that has a  lot of avantikas crew theyve pushed a bunch of chairs clammed together clammed crammed  together with some bits of dried bread and somewhat soft fruit some cheeses 
none	 laid out and  two large pitchers of ale already waiting at the getgo right off from them you see a smaller  table with everyone youve hired from the mistake including orly all sitting there clutching their  glasses looking around scared shitless as soon as you enter their eyes turn to you and they go  laughter  travis they do that cafeteria thing hey hey you want to sit over here  matt at which point avantika goes come have a seat and pushes one of the other tables out of  the way of a few 
tavern	 other people that are already sitting at it she takes her hand and scoots it  across the table and they both go annoyed grunt and spit on the ground and get up and move  away immediately you get the sense that there is a power dynamic avantika seems to have at least  some modicum of respect amongst the rest of the riffraff within this tavern  taliesin shes a heather  marisha knowing laugh  matt pushing the tables together kicking a couple of the stools over it looks like theres  enough spots at the table 
none	 for most of you one or two of you might have to stand or find a place  next to the rest of your hired help  taliesin ill stand  laura ill stand too  matt as you guys all sit down drinks and rounds begin to be passed to each of you conversations  already middiscussing you hear bits and pieces about how the blessing of the serpent has been  upon us this past month being on the ship with most of the crew they havent been terribly  social with you theyve helped you and guided 
none	 you in learning a few things but theres still very  much this separation and attention that youre the newcomers and a strange new shiny thing in their  captains eye this is the first time youve seen them a little bit three sheets to the wind as a  group and theyre talking openly avantika has a definite zealotry to her but you start noticing  members of the crew and why they are with her or at least now that theyve been there theyve  also bought into these tales of ukotoa you get the sense that they 
none	 believe that this path that  shes following will lead to her success and by default probably their success  taliesin how many of them are true believers give or take  matt make an insight check for me  travis youre no good at those right  taliesin im terrible at these  travis i want to know what blood type they are  taliesin 26  matt okay thatll do thatll yeah okay you get the sense that vera whos the older human  the toughlooking woman who was her quartermaster before it was passed to fjord is 
none	 definitely the  most invested in this idea this spiritual journey theyre all embarking on with captain at the helm  you also feel that ipess whos the gnome second mate that youve encountered previously in a very  similar way is completely invested eyes wide his general banter tends to be a little crazed and  sporadic but whenever theyre talking about the great serpent now with phrasing of the leviathan  as the title has become more prominent with discovery theres a reverence to his eyes and an  attentiveness that is out of character for him so 
none	 you mark vera and ipess as two very intent  believers behind avantika  taliesin is there anybody whos awkwardly into it but definitely would probably walk away if  they could is there anybody whos a little  matt you get the sense that bouldergut the ogre halfunderstands it and is more just excited  because everyone else is excited its like a dog that gets really wound up when everyone around is  talking loud thats bouldergut a number of the deckhands appear to be invested but theyre less  intensely driven and more just excited that their 
none	 captains excited and maybe starting to consider  that there is something to this now that theyve seen the things theyve seen and the powers that  shes acquired thats a good spread of what youve managed to gather  taliesin thatll do  travis ill grab a drink and ill head over to where veras sitting  matt okay vera is sitting directly to the right of avantika and theres not much space to sit  next to her but you could grab a stool and squeeze in to her right side  travis yeah ill take a drink 
none	 and ill plop it down right in front of her and ill take a knee on  the floor so im kneeling next to her on the other side of avantika ill say hey listen no  hard feelings right  matt there is no hard feelings i understand the reasoning and the captains word is law i am  excited to see the great things you accomplish as the quartermaster of our ship  travis right whatevers best for the ship  matt precisely and for the captain  travis well i feel the presence of ukotoa smiling on 
none	 all of us and i know that our  partnership here will be a beneficial one  matt i can only agree  travis well this has been fun if you need anything as your quartermaster you just let me know  matt aye aye captain looks to avantika avantika right now is deep in the cups at this  point a figure turns around the corner you see a male gnome short maybe in his 40s or so with  spiked hair its thinning on the top but you can see hes taken thick balms of some kind to 
none	 try and  make it look intensely young and failing halfway big mutton chops that come down to a very pointed  chin and hes dressed in fairly decent clothing a nice silk vest with billowing sleeves out of his  shirt with some bangles that clink around his wrists he comes and finds you on the opposite  side and looks across to avantika grinning he goes well well well its been a while since  weve seen you round here she turns to him and goes ah sorris youre back from that fools  errand i see how 
none	 was the shattered teeth he goes eh foggy and cold as shit how goes your  cloudchasing journeys love she goes grand we might have scored a fine shipwreck and a  promise of salvage eh looks back to him you up for hire perhaps he goes eh tempting but  nah im still fresh off the water want to enjoy myself a while shes like all right very  well well be in port for a day or two while we get some repairs done if you change your mind  well just start shouting im sure well find 
none	 your annoying voice easy enough he goes  giggles sure that is eh youre all new round here  laura arr  sam yeah were new pirates are you a pirate i mean i guess were all pirates right everyones  a pirate here  matt at the moment no at the moment im a civilian and a drunkard  sam oh  taliesin shattered teeth whats the shattered teeth did your teeth shatter is that a place  matt no its a series of islands to the south of here  taliesin oh  laura we know that because 
none	 were pirates too and we know those things  taliesin i could fill a book with what i dont know  travis sorry i didnt catch your name it was  matt sorris sorris kay whats your name  travis oh im fjord nice to meet you  matt fjord all right  sam are you a captain or do you do something else thats more specialized  matt me no im a sniper  sam a sniper  liam what do you snipe with  matt things why are you so curious  liam youre an interesting fellow  
none	 matt speak for yourself sir whats your name  liam my name is phillip  matt make a deception check  sam name check  travis strong name  liam what is that i dont have my contacts in i can barely see it thats 11 right so that is 17  matt he goes okay phillip and whats your specialty what do you bring to the crew  liam oh i am a navigator newer but eager and looking forward to plying my trade  sam quick phillip which ways north  liam its right that way  sam 
none	 thats amazing  matt thats actually pretty good  sam you can spin him here im going to spin him around a couple times now which ways north  liam its still over toward the hallway over there  sam wow right  matt thats pretty good me ive got a few odds and things mainly with a longbow good shot  there but an eye that can see things on the horizon mainly live up in the crows nest you  know keep an eye out  liam you know this is our first time on these islands and 
tavern	 i dont know much about it at all is  there any legal system here do you know what i mean or is it just you know gunshots  matt hes joking right avantika goes im afraid not his bailiwick apparently is being  curious and clueless  liam i am a big reader and there is a lot i dont know like my tall friend over here i mean there  must be trouble that breaks out there must be bar fights  matt of course bar fights are fun thats part of the reason we live here  
none	 liam well i can see the appeal but what happens if theres something risky or it causes theft of  property for someone important  matt if its a member of the revelry thieving from another member of the revelry and it gets  found out its brought to plank king plank king makes a judgment based on that some sort of  reparations or thud screaming impacts  liam so plank king is the law  matt more or less  liam thats biblical  laura but you can still fight other people for fun  matt why you 
none	 looking for a fight  laura are you looking for a fight  matt always  sam dont fight each other  laura why  sam because thats crazy  matt i never throw the first punch so anytime he taps the side of one of his jowls you hear the  ruffle of his fingers through his somewhat curled muttonchop on the side  marisha do it  matt grabs a drink and without breaking eye contact  travis we just got here  sam why why would you do this  marisha im the worst influence im going 
none	 to say do it  liam we are trying to get the lay of the land here  laura tusktooth  travis gulping  laura i punch him in the chin  matt roll an attack  taliesin you didnt even ask him if theres a bookshop nearby  liam might have gotten to that perhaps  laura unarmed strike 14 no 15  matt 15 hits you do one point of damage plus your strength modifier  laura four points of damage  matt boom right across his chin he falls to the ground turns around rubs his chin 
none	 that was a  surprising bit of power there for someone your size come at me he dives at you roll initiative  marisha yes  laura 16  matt oh he beats you at a 17 15 plus two for a small size he is quick and he jukes to one side  turns around and goes for a haymaker to the side of your face thats cocked thats a 14 to hit  laura oh i turn and he hits my shield  matt ping ah  laura i swipe at him with my tail and try to 
none	 trip him  matt go for it make another attack roll  laura 19  matt are you just doing damage or are you trying to shove him and knock him prone  laura just knock him prone  matt okay thats your athletics check actually  laura oh okay so i would add 13 plus athletics  matt hes going to make his acrobatics to try and dodge  laura 16  matt natural 19 he manages to leap in the air and your tail hits the side of the table and  thudding to one side the drinks 
none	 begin to spill and one reaches out and grabs them prevents them  from being knocked over  travis were all grabbing our drinks and standing up  laura wow youre quick  matt as soon as you turn back and say that you look and hes not anywhere to be seen then you  hear this footsteps under the table you glance down as you watch him leaping up from between your  legs and the table to uppercut you right in the chin thats 18 to hit  laura im 18  matt he just manages to hit 
none	 you you take three points of damage crack right from underneath the  chin you feel your jaw clink into your teeth theres a horrible screeching sound it hurts you  can feel the numbness in your face from the impact after he hits you he darts off around  from behind and hes probably going to go in for a hold but you have your go  laura okay im going to reach out and try to punch him in the back of the head  matt go for it  sam inelegant but perfect  laura oh no 
town	 natural one  matt you go to swing for his head and he grabs your hand and goes ahahah he goes to pull  you forward to go for a headbutt  matt thats a 19 to hit  laura fuck me  matt crack right in the front of the forehead and the nose you can immediately feel the blood  beginning to pour from underneath  sam crikey  matt behind you guys watch the crowd a lot of peoples attention have turned to this bar fight  a few of them are now backing up and getting 
tavern	 their drinks ready to watch somebody else at the table  goes impacts and punches somebody else and starts another aspect and now theres another bar  fight beginning down the side corner its your go oh wait yeah because he finished the  heatbutt so you go  laura how much damage was that  matt three points of damage every time you get hit he does three points  laura okay okay okay oh no should i be mean  travis should i be mean  laura im going to grab him after he hits my head and 
none	 im going to try to knee him  matt okay go for it roll for an attack  laura thats good thats 23  matt yeah that definitely hits  laura four points of damage right between the legs  matt another four points there all right ugh his eyes squint and roll backwards a bit and he  goes down into a crouching position grunting rights himself in almost a muay thai stance  laura below the belt  matt yeah thats 11 he tries to swing and you parry it off to the side without an issue go 
none	  ahead and retort  laura im going to grab his wrist and try to spin him around  matt go for it  laura 16  matt 16 hits  laura yeah im going to grab him and try to grab both of his arms and hold him on to me  matt because youre grappling  laura yeah  matt roll again for your athletics  laura oh no that was really bad five  matt he rolled a natural one literally a natural one he tries to squeeze out but youve got a  firm grip on

none	 nature of the 20 well make it double full  damage because its fist fights thats six damage to you from that crack the leg and the  knee doesnt dislocate or pop out but you can feel it get pushed to the limit and it hurts like  a mother leaps up and like not too bad come on bring it one eyes a little bit not  swollen but its starting to squint from pain bloods leaking out of his nose and his mouth and  its smeared on one side of his cheek and hes chuckling

none	 sam yes you did good job jester  travis yeah and you kept all your teeth  laura and marisha pirates  matt he comes up and goes for a handshake grabs your hand pulls you and gives you a soft  headbutt its a little sore on both of you and both of you wince pleasure to meet you whats  your name  laura the little sapphire thats my pirate name  matt okay sorris pleasure to meet you as well as you guys are having this conversation  you hear behind you grunting crashing another table behind 
town	 is broken and you can see a person  unconscious across the shattered pieces of wood arms curled in trex style  travis nott unconscious person down  sam ooh im going to go steal from them oh wait no you cant do that on this island  marisha is that blues traveler  sam it is the traveler  matt the crowd goes cheering everyone who was mildly disappointed at the lack of finale to your  fight has now focused on the other one that has completed with the smashing of furniture the  person on there left 
none	 scrapped up and wrecked the other individual one eye swollen shut  squarejawed burlylooking guy going yeah everyone cheers  travis whats the rest of avantikas crew doing are they in the scrap as well  matt theyre just watching the scrap was only between two or three people and one of them just  went down the other one called it off after that and the declared winner everyones briefly  focusing on then as fast as everyone cared everyone sat back down and theyre back to  drinking you get the sense in that moment this is not 
tavern	 a rare occurrence around here  travis hourly flareup  taliesin its like someone ordered a special at an extremely expensive tiki bar  marisha and taliesin ukotoa ukotoa ukotoa huh  travis wow where the fuck did you guys just go i hope were going there after this show  taliesin and marisha go to trader sams  marisha where that mug came from  taliesin thats why i have my tiki mug today  liam caleb brings a big mug of ale and sits down close to avantika and says over this din this is  a big 
none	 longshot but you seem very welltraveled and wellresearched this place is crazy but any  place worth its salt has books why are you laughing at me why are you laughing at me such a  straightforward question well i can tell from your reaction that there is probably no good place  to acquire a book but you seem more educated than the normal sort or people around me so perhaps  you have a suggestion for a scholar lost at sea  matt it is a very curious question i imagine there are probably some books that wouldnt 
none	 be  what is commonly considered contraband or heavy resale value most of the time when you are  boarding a ship you leave the books behind if youre looking for books your best bet is to go  to the sundry square during the day  liam sundry square during the day  matt its about four blocks to the left after you leave the outside of here just outside of the  shipyard its where all the awnings and ships are  liam should i be checking the trash bins for these then or do you think someone 
none	 might  actually have them for sale  matt you can certainly ask around maybe both i dont know  liam im jonesing pretty badly for a good book  taliesin im looking for a blacksmith actually as well  matt that is possibly a few around if i recall  taliesin somebody worth their salt since worth your salt is a really nice term thats great  worth their salt somebody worth their salt  travis just taken with the saying  sam hes going to use that a lot that phrase  taliesin its worth my salt  
none	 marisha caduceus how much is salt worth to you like on a scale of money to nothing  liam like a persons worth  taliesin oh i dont know i havent really thought about it at all now that i think about  it thats a good question i mean theres so much salt around to be fair it would probably  take a lot of salt to be worth something  marisha sure  taliesin i mean you could get it right out of the water  travis yeah its a fairly benign saying dont get too lost in 
none	 it  taliesin everything is worth its salt at that point really its a terrible currency  sam did he drink a lot  travis i was wondering how empty that cup is  taliesin has anyone been watching me drink  travis i was going to ask  taliesin i have been nursing the same cup the entire time and have been fakesipping it the  entire night i havent actually had a drop  travis you had an ale or whatever everybody else is drinking  taliesin whatever they handed me ive been doing this to be fair 
none	 the entire time weve been together  marisha hes bruce wayne caduceus wayne  travis caduceus wayne  sam and marisha caduce wayne  marisha i elbow fjord and i sit down next to avantika  liam oh jeez take my chair fine ill go get another  marisha sorry excuse me sorry so avantika whats next for the squalleater  matt well and she sits looks around everyone at the table and gestures for everyone to lean in  a bit it looks like we are to after a couple of days of travel and supplygathering make our way 
none	  northward to a location that has been brought to my attention by our quartermaster there is a  likely chance that if there is some sort of treasure there it would be of importance to our  mission however it is a salvage mission meaning there will be some diving so i am looking for a  few things to prepare for that so a few of us can comfortably make our way beneath the waves  sam into the water  matt beneath the water my friend  sam do cannonfolk typically go on those trips or do 
none	 cannonfolk typically stay behind with the ship  travis gunner master nott gunner master  sam gunner master  matt that is up to you you are welcome to stay behind however if things go correctly i dont  think there will be any worry of drowning  sam oh how can you promise that  matt trust me i have a few connections that owe me a favor or two here on the island anyway i  need a day to acquire what is necessary nevertheless at this point she looks up at  somebody past you and goes 
none	 were having a private discussion you turn and follow her eye  line and you see a human female with curled blonde hair the curls have fallen in the moisture and  the rain from the outside dressed in a thick ragged black coat holding a cup and she goes  aye dont worry about me just didnt expect this shore to drag you in quite so soon theres  a moment of tension  laura do we recognize her  matt no you have not seen this figure before they both stare for a second and she turns and 
none	  walks off to a far table  travis was she directing that towards avantika  matt yeah  laura who was that  marisha what what did she say havent heard didnt expect this what  matt dont mind her its allison shes whats the word a right cunt  taliesin not heather make a note  sam friend of yours or former friend  matt oh best of friends no just a very nosy cothief at sea doesnt know where to stop poking  where it doesnt belong  liam former business associate  matt no former competitor 
none	 anyway  marisha i immediately grab my purse and hold onto it  sam what purse  marisha the thing i imagine most adventurers have a little coin satchel  sam oh but not like a cute little  marisha no not a dolce  gabbana no not a kate spade  travis you mean a competitor in terms of sea space or in terms of your faith  matt no weve crossed territories once or twice and she has a habit of trying to embellish  truths to the plank king anyway hand me the map if you dont 
none	 mind oh maps here actually  sam i knew someone like that once they would always go fishing and say that they caught  something but they never did  taliesin a fisherman  sam yes  matt avantika lays a map out on the table  sam ooh well put our weights down to weigh it down  marisha no there was a discussion its coming  laura oh yeah coasters are not heavy enough  taliesin heres a cube have a cube  matt a cube will do  taliesin theres a cube  sam theres a cube 
none	  matt as avantika points it out she shows the crew and says in two days travel we will make  our way outside of the dragshallow reef coasting in northward for protection to about here we  begin looking for our salvage at which point orly whos glancing over the side rubs his chin  and goes hmm i dont mean to question the captains mmmain objective however that looks  like its right around where the divers grave mmmay be  travis divers grave  matt she looks back and goes perhaps but does it spook you do 
none	 ghost stories make you shiver  turtle boy orly glances back at her with a narrowed stare and goes as long as im staying  on the ship i dont mmmind he goes and sits back down at the table  laura do divers die there  matt at this point sorris goes oh is that where youre going youre going over to the  divers grave  travis it would appear so yeah  matt well thats certainly an offlimits location for most salvaging thanks to the cursed  woman eh do you know much about your history  
none	 taliesin im hoping this is a place where somebody named rachel diver may have bought a  piece of land or something  matt close but not at all  marisha yeah or sophie its always a sophie  matt make a history check you can with disadvantage because of your lack of experience  with the naval history  laura would i have heard ghost stories  matt you can make a history check as well  travis 15  matt okay  laura 19  liam 13  matt doesnt quite catch your attention youve heard mention of 
none	 the divers grave as it was a  series of poems from a book you once read the thing that comes to mind is the name dashilla you  instinctively mouth it dashilla and he goes ah dashilla the dreadful you know about this one eh  laura i mean i read a poem about her  matt ah poem ive not known but maybe the song youve heard some of the crew around nod  remembering and he goes and grabs his cup and claps it twice to the table and the crew begins  to filter in as 
none	 the song progresses and he goes  marisha if theres not 12 people that pop out behind this curtain im going to be disappointed  matt so he finishes the song  laughter  taliesin i was waiting for him to go bill murray  matt sorris goes singing where once the waters rolled calmly by where oceans heart did  sing there stalked a lass with a hungry eye and claws that grasp and wring with lantern lure of a  glimmer pot with treasure in her eyes below they swam to the gold they thought would await them 
none	 as  their prize everyone starts clamoring together with the third verse singing yet each of them  went to surely die their graves to not be found for dashilla and her hungry eye collects the lost  and drowned theres a moment where they all begin to clamor the drinks together and clink them  and begin to drink them  applause  travis yeah thats fortuitous  laura her hungry eye  travis her claws  marisha her lantern light  laura doesnt she have a ring or something that you said in the song  marisha yeah 
none	 i heard something about a ring and treasure in her eyes  matt he looks confused so you dont know the poem or the song  laura no i know it i just didnt i mean i read it like one time a long time ago  matt do you want a reprisal  laura yeah  matt clears throat singing where once the waters rolled calmly by where oceans heart did  sing there stalked a lass with a hungry eye and claws that grasp and wring with lantern lure of a  glimmer pot with treasure in their 
none	 eyes below they swam to the gold they thought would await  them as their prize yet each of them went to surely die their graves to not be found for  dashilla and her hungry eye collects the lost and drowned  travis single eye huh  taliesin damn  travis anyone else getting a bad feeling about that  laura no why would you ever get a bad feeling about that  sam record scratching remix  travis lowpitched break it break it break it down  laura her hungry eye  matt he goes but thats just 
none	 an old wives tale you know a myth  travis sorris is that somewhere youve been to you seem like a very fortuneseeking type  matt well i sail over it we just dont really salvage that  travis you dont stop either  matt what in the middle of the ocean why thatd be daft good luck looks at avantika  singsong good luck with the missus and turns around  sam with the missus oh the lady  laura oh dashilla  matt you surmise thats who hes referring to avantika goes dont pay him any mind it 
none	 is a  myth and if its not well we just finished tangling with a hydra and an entire island of snake  people youre not seriously worried about a woman eh  laura well we didnt fight them under the water  liam yeah im more concerned about the waves you have experience with this diving  matt i should have an answer to at least most of our troubles by the morrow just be patient  liam yes or no question  travis you know most myths are based off of some sort of fact we dont happen 
none	 to know what the  song thinks this dreadful creature is do we  matt not any more than you would  laura shes an underwater banshee for sure  travis is that a thing  laura mmhmm yeah  travis you cant really sing underwater so hows that work  laura it sounds a lot like glubby glubs  underwater glubbing  travis i love that everyone did that at the same time thats all i needed well great well find  this solution to the diving in the morning and then in a day or two well make 
none	 our way  matt that is the idea  travis do you need any help securing this solution  matt no its best i do it alone its more of a older business relationship i dont want to make  him think that this is a how do you say untrustworthy trade if you will  travis well being that youll be out anything you need done for the ship or the crew while  youre away as your quartermaster  matt well oversee the repairs to the mistake i believe theyve begun before the night is over for  
none	 a bit we probably will not need it for this endeavor so it will begin and when we return from  darktow it should be complete  travis wonderful all right and your crew do i need to keep an eye on anyone  matt not in particular theyll be looking around here theyll be preparing gather their  materials anything you think you require for the trip at sea go ahead and gather it go amongst the  sundry square purchase what is required and then hopefully within the next 48 hours well be back  out on the 
none	 waves  marisha 48 hours  travis wonderful  taliesin whats allison been up to  matt drinking in the back having a conversation with somebody and keeping one eye over at the  table seems just perturbed not directly intent but occasionally narrowing her eyes in the  direction of avantika  travis being that this is our first time in darktow i would like to see the rest of the area  would anyone care to join me for a stroll  marisha ooh night walk  taliesin that sounds like a great idea  laura sure  
none	 matt it is good if you are going to do a night walk alone or together as a group is much better  than alone  taliesin what should we be looking out for is there some sort of natural dangers unnatural dangers  travis back corners alleys  matt well the laws say youre not to steal from another pirate in here but only if theyre caught  marisha oh i forgot  laura oh you totally could have gotten the stuff from that guy  sam frustrated noise  matt but there are others out there perhaps who 
none	 see fresh faces and think well easy prey best  not to cause a huge commotion immediately after arriving nobody does that right  travis no  laura definitely wouldnt  travis who would be so foolish little would they know theyd be tangling with avantikas crew and  thats something they dont want to mess with right  matt one would think yes anyway i am a bit tipsy and im going to find myself an evenings  rest the rest of the night and tomorrow is yours good eve  sam bon soir  marisha good night  
none	 laura bye  matt as she gets up some of the rest of the crew stands up you see bouldergut in the back stand up  as soon as the captain stands up and goes like we going come on this way walks by puts  her hand on your shoulder and into your ear fjord as she whispers she goes im staying  upstairs second room on the left and leaves  laura did any of us see that  matt make a perception check  laura laughter  taliesin oh thats a bad roll  travis you see 
none	 everything why are you even rolling  taliesin 11  marisha it feels pretty public  laura 15  travis youve got fucking madeye moodys eye where its on me the whole time and the other  ones doing its own thing  matt actually caduceus just from his passive perception has seen this what did you roll  laura 15  matt 15 you see theres a momentary pause as she walks by and the hand on the shoulder that  catches your attention you can see the lips move and make out the essence of the conversation  
none	 the rest of her crew slowly gets up and some of them stay to drink some of them go out to find  their way in the night  marisha i need to pee anyone know where the bathroom is  liam pretty sure its anywhere  taliesin outside  matt you do recall walking through the city a number of individuals stopping at the edge of the  docks and pissing into the ocean  sam in halfling i will say to beauregard hey dont you think we should go talk to that allison person  marisha i was 
none	 already on it i respond back in halfling  sam can i tag along  marisha mmhmm jester  laura mm  marisha do you have a pen and paper i could borrow  sam she asks in halfling  laura i dont understand what  marisha sorry got caught in a language loop do you have any pencil and paper or pen and ink  laura yeah well of course i do i always have a lot of stuff on me here you go  marisha just like a scrap thank you i scribble meet in the alley on 
town	 the piece of paper is  there an alley im assuming theres an alley behind this  matt i mean  sam theres no streets its all alleys  matt its entirely crafted of alleys no i mean its not very jampacked around this particular  taverninn but there are some nearby buildings where there are alleys this place is surrounded  by streets because its right there on the front near the shipyard  marisha meet in the back alley to be specific  sam vague directions  matt okay and what do you do  marisha will you 
none	 go with me to the ladies room so we can powder our noses together  sam sure i love a good powder  marisha lets go powder as i walk out i shake alices hand say nice to meet you and palm her  the piece of paper thats folded very tightly  matt okay as you take her hand she pulls back you get a closer look at her theres this heavy  scar over one eye that keeps the eye mostly closed you can see there looks to be a ruined eye  beneath there thats healed over 
none	 and is not functional she wears it proudly as a point of  intimidation or at least a badge of whatever gave her that scar as she pulls back a little bit her  other hand going towards the dagger on the side thats now revealed from behind her coat you palm  her the note and she looks and takes it  marisha give her a wink and walk off  matt she crumples it with a terse look and lets it fall to the ground  liam ooh cold  marisha i go and i walk out shell 
none	 read it right  sam wheres the bathroom  taliesin im going to get some air  travis ridiculous  sam we just walked across the whole place i havent seen the bathroom once  marisha lets go around to the side of the building  sam oh were just going to take a shit in the alley  marisha we are a hundred percent going to take a shit in the alley  liam here comes the fanart i hope  matt you guys walk out into the cold night air the heavy mist has fallen across darktow and 
tavern	 you  can barely see beyond the outskirts of the city where the ocean begins you can still hear the  waters coming in against the rocks on the outside of the island but you cannot actually see where  the water connects beyond that you can see the outline of the ship masts that are set at the end  of the shipyard that are vanishing into the mist that surround you what do you do  marisha i go towards the back alley  matt okay you find what would be considered an alley behind the inn and 
tavern	 tavern  marisha i show nott where to take a shit i wait either for the rest of my friends or for alice to  eventually read the damn thing  sam is it alice or allison  laura i thought it was allison  marisha allison  travis shes on a nickname basis already  sam maybe thats why she didnt listen to you because you called her the wrong name  travis shes like were not there yet were not fucking alice yet  marisha it works half of the time  laura thats so pretty  marisha 
none	 its super awesome  sam if she comes out here what are we going to say to her  marisha i just want to figure out what her beef is with avantika maybe she can be our key  sam but shes going to ask who we are what do we tell her that were disgruntled members of her crew  marisha yeah  sam but she can turn us in thats terrible we should say that were  marisha we can get information from her first we dont have to necessarily always give information  upfront to get information 
none	 and we can always lie  sam im not good at that  marisha i am  sam okay  marisha yeah  sam yeah youre right youre very charismatic were going to be fine  marisha i feel like thats slightly underhanded  sam no it seems that way because im making a face because im halfway through a dump right now  marisha i dont break eye contact  sam and marisha we got this  travis oh the hand touch no  sam im ready  marisha all right  taliesin maybe that is better  laura

none	 know if something happens in the heat of the moment or theres danger in both directions  murder is premeditated thats a very different thing i find it hard to believe that you have  killed someone with premeditation i could be wrong but  laura no i dont i havent ever done that ive done some pretty shady stuff though  liam that i believe  laura have you done some shady stuff  liam yes i have  laura have you done stuff thats piratey before you were a pirate  liam yeah sort of  laura whats 
tavern	 the shadiest thing you ever did  liam oh well nott and i have robbed people for sure people with not a lot of money so that we can eat  laura thats okay though  liam that did that we did to you when we first met you you know we turn one thing into another  and then we go stay at an inn and buy food and then it turns back into pennies and thats not so  good but when youre starving  laura but it is a really cool trick they got to see magic 
none	  liam they didnt know it though  laura thats true it all balances out youve done really good things too  liam yeah  laura do you want some of this lumpy milk  liam no do you want any ale  laura no  liam boy this is quite a predicament that weve gotten ourselves into how the hell we were  visiting your mother your mother was so lovely  laura i know shes so nice and now were pirates and im never going to see her again  liam thats not true  laura its really

none	 doesnt like the water either basically because it tried to kill him a  few times already  liam really none of us like it here but fjord kind of  laura i dont even know if he likes it a lot  liam theres parts of it that he likes  laura like avantika  liam i dont know youre sweet on him yeah  laura i dont know  liam yeah  laura it feels funny  liam how do you mean  laura well you know when you really like somebody but then you start to know 
none	 them and you  go do i like them or do i like what i thought they were and then you dont know  liam i think so  laura and then you think that they are flirting with you but then you found out that probably  werent you know  marisha or just saving your life  laura so you feel kind of sad about it and maybe a little stupid  liam thats a little out of my realm of experience im sorry  laura you had a girlfriend before though yeah whispering you said her name

tavern	 well probably going to get a room somewhere here is this place an inn or a tavern  i did not even look coming in  matt glancing now looking through the back there is this staircase that winds up to a  secondary floor and it looks like there probably is lodging  liam did avantika leave or did she go up  matt avantika left for the moment  taliesin ill have to secure the things  liam probably to shit in an alleyway  travis youre up front right  taliesin im sitting out front im doing 
none	 the door  matt what are you guys doing  laura i guess just sitting in here for a while  matt caleb  liam just drinking until  travis i put my hand on caduceus shoulder how you doing  taliesin i think im doing all right im just contemplating where were going from here  travis you seemed a little more at ease ill lean in a little bit  taliesin i am a little more at ease  travis you do much drinking in there im not really getting the fumes on your breath  taliesin ive 
tavern	 only gotten drunk once in my life  travis really  taliesin and that was because of nott  travis is there a reason for that  taliesin i thought id try it didnt agree with me  travis what happens when you drink  taliesin everything hurts and its violently offensive to the body on every level that stuffs  disgusting just awful  travis did you have stuff in your cup right you dont have to fake it you can just  taliesin well it feels polite and not everybody is as understanding as your friends you know 
none	  travis right  taliesin i just sit in the corner and i listen to everything that i can for as long as i can and it  got a little noisy in there and thought id get a little air  travis anything popping up on that special radar of yours  taliesin oh yeah this place is dangerous shes dangerous  travis yeah that she is should we grab the others and go explore for a bit  taliesin i think thats a good idea and fjord you know why everybodys doing this why were all  here 
none	 right  travis yep i mean i think  taliesin i think you know it i just want to point it because that woman she doesnt care what  any of us want im sure shed be interested but its way low on her priorities and i dont trust  anybody who puts other peoples needs that low on the list and you should keep mind of that while  youre getting in bed with them so to speak  travis is anybody out here in earshot  matt outside at the moment no  taliesin nope  travis yeah

none	 things is to  taliesin sure im so glad you put it that way youre a good man fjord so be careful because i  imagine its a little out of character being honest and truthful with somebody in a deceptive  way it can muddle a good man up whereas it doesnt muddle a bad man up  travis yeah havent been very good at it so far  taliesin thats one of the reasons why i like you  travis thank you  taliesin here for you man ive been learning to swim  travis yeah more of

none	  guys as comfortable as possible through this deeply inconvenient situation weve all found  ourselves in  matt i would be lying if it wasnt deeply inconvenient  taliesin appreciate your honesty  travis whispering ask him about the divers grave  taliesin what would not be an insult  laura i hit his hand high five  taliesin like that i know that would be an insult but what would not be an how many kids  are here  matt if were staying behind id say give me about a hundred gold to watch over the nest 
none	 around  here when you return well hopefully i understand perhaps you mmmight be coming back  for us  taliesin without question  matt then ill return whatever was not spent  taliesin thats a good idea  marisha ive got 50 gold on that  travis ill get the other 50  taliesin thank you kids we are unless something goes tragically wrong we expect to be  returning and i imagine youll hear word if things go tragically wrong  matt marius comes over and goes right now hoping no tragedy just come back and get us 
none	 off  this fucking hellhole  laura well if we dont come back cant you take the mistake and go home  matt if you dont come back i dont know  taliesin how long do we expect to be gone for  matt travel from here to there and back about four or five days round  laura two weeks if were not back in two weeks  taliesin if its two weeks the ship is yours  matt all right well i wish you all mmmuch luck  taliesin i appreciate that hopefully you will not have to 
none	 play a funeral dirge for us  matt i am hoping that is never the case guess ill just make some coin in the interim  taliesin thats fair  travis if i may orly you seem to be very familiar with the divers grave and the song do  you know anything more specific of it and creatures that might be in that area things to  look out for  matt i mean standard deepocean folk  travis deepocean folk  matt sharks  marisha whispering mermaids  matt other underwater beasts  taliesin whats a mermaid  
none	 matt perhaps mmmermaids and other such dangers  taliesin how many teeth does a mermaid have what is that  laura mermaids are part pretty people and part fish people  taliesin those are both very dangerous  laura well yeah  travis any good things about the area that you care to share  matt probably some worthwhile loot there amongst the sediment  travis right  taliesin any idea how long ships have been going down in that region  matt oh a few hundred years maybe  liam a few hundred years is there some sort of 
none	 weather pattern or natural phenomenon that is  responsible for this  matt no ships go down all over the coast  liam but there arent creepy stories about every inch of it is there  matt there are quite a number of creepy stories on every part of this here coast  liam fair point  sam do you know how deep it is to the bottom there is it deep deep ocean or just mediumocean  matt cant say i do  sam all right  matt mmmy apologies  taliesin thank you for your time and thank 
none	 you for your trust  matt come back  taliesin working on it  travis all right who are we missing  marisha night hike were all here  travis why are you guys wiping your hands on your pants  marisha dont worry about it  sam its fine  travis okay who wants to go explore  laura lets go  sam lets go explore  liam what are we looking for are we just taking it in  marisha were looking for fresh air  travis yeah i figured well use the night air to our advantage 
none	 acclimate a little bit  taliesin lets take a walk lets see what there is to see im excited about this  liam learn the city  taliesin yeah  matt yasha leans in and goes if there is any trouble should i  travis oh if there is trouble lets try and resolve it well  matt i trust you just  marisha gauge it as it comes  travis yeah  matt tell me when you want  travis the judge will do its so intimidating when she says it like that  marisha it is  laura 
tavern	 can i have taken im assuming a short rest and heal up from my fight while we were all  chilling here  matt sure  marisha we should get a wig for the judge like the plank king has  travis for the sword  marisha yeah  travis and liam a wig  marisha just throwing it out there  sam sort of like a golf club cover  taliesin like a teacozy a swordcozy  matt okay you guys leave the tavern  travis up away from the docks  matt okay as you exit caduceus you 
tavern	 notice this but jester as everyones leaving you to  the back of it you feel a hand grab your arm for a minute you look over to the side and you may  not have noticed earlier but vera had been in the inn in the tavern vicinity she pulls you back  from the rest of the group for a second and looks you in the eye with this intense stare you can  see the wrinkles on the sides of her face pushing into this tight crows nest on each side her  irises bloodshot she goes 
none	 he would not be the first shes left in ruin and he would not be the  last i will take care of him if he cannot she releases you and spins around and walks off to her room  taliesin i caught a bit of that right  matt you saw them discuss but you werent at the point of talking and looking you wouldnt  have made out the words necessarily  laura whispering whoa  matt you guys are here in the open night air youre pushing midnight here at darktow  laura it smells like poop 
none	 out here  travis checking the bottom of my shoes like what did we step in why is it  sam the sea breeze at night its a landbreeze  taliesin actually i have to stop really quickly and use the bathroom theres these little  outhouses over in the corner right here that drop straight down into the  travis outhouse campaign two here we go  taliesin yeah its like the tower bridge  sam is anyone on the streets  liam ja and how welllit is it out here  marisha yeah whos watching  matt its 
town	 pretty misty there are not heavy clouds in the sky and the moon seems to be not a  full moon but it seems to be fairly bright but because of the mist it diffuses there is this  general faint moonlight throughout the entire vicinity of the town what that does is it makes  distant visibility a little harder much like fog lights at a distance there are a number of  patrolling individuals no uniform to them but they walk around torch in hand looking through  the streets keeping an eye theyre armed armored but haphazard 
none	 and no uniform  marisha this is the revelry  matt everyone here seems to be a part of the revelry including yourselves now  laura keep your hands on your coin purses  sam okay if were going to talk about these things lets use some code words dont say her  name say a different name  travis like  laura tiffany  sam yes tiffany  marisha shes kind of like a tiffany  travis okay tiffany and  sam the name of the ship  travis which ship  sam tiffanys ship  laura thats the 
none	 name tiffanys ship  sam tiffanys ship is the name of tiffanys ship  marisha that makes it clear  travis how will they crack this if they hear us  sam thats all the code we need all right  travis how do we reference the  marisha we call it the  travis the apricot  sam the apricot  marisha the apricot  sam anything else before we get into this  marisha wait is the apricot this or is the apricot the tiny tiffany ship  travis nope its this  marisha its this okay  
none	 laura your heart the apricot is your heart  travis say that again  taliesin its the tip of the tiny tiffany ship  sam all right so how will we deal with tiffany  marisha holy shit  taliesin which ones tiffany  travis lets walkandtalk about tiffany  sam of course were walkingandtalking  marisha im keeping an eye open for every suspiciouslooking asshole  laura tiffany can be invisible though you guys  sam everyone do this  travis tiffany doesnt know that were talking about her  sam she went to bed shes fine  laura 
none	 im going to keep an eye out to see if the mist ever parts around us  matt okay both you and beau make perception checks please since youre both keeping eyes out  travis come on  sam she wont know were talking about her because were using a new name tiffany so shes  not even going to know  taliesin 26  matt okay youre keeping a gauge on any of the wandering patrolling guards to make sure as to  not to speak too loudly or in the presence of anyone conversation either shifting temporarily  
town	 or coming to a lull and walking by in silence but you manage to snake your way through a relatively  quiet town beyond the various taverns this late at night  travis a lot of store fronts and things that are closed up for the night  matt you do wander through what you assume to be the sundry square eventually through this  wandering there is a makeshift pavilion where its dotted with tables and crates under ratty  awnings and canopies but its all closed and dark theres no lights it looks like none of the  
none	 materials for sale are left behind its mainly just a structure and materials are probably  brought there in the morning and are placed out for trade sell or whatever  laura dont you think its weird that someone would be a pirate and they would come here because  they were a pirate and then they change their mind and decide to be a shopkeeper here instead  travis no maybe they were looking for a new environment and they found exactly what they were  looking for  liam maybe they thought they were tough and strong and 
none	 they were not as tough and strong as  they thought so now they sell rope  matt make a history check  marisha it feels like a farmers market it feels like certain people sell things whenever they got them  travis ooh natural 17 for 19  liam 12  matt you do know darktow before it was taken by pirates about 45 years or so beforehand it was  just another city of the clovis concord it belonged to the menagerie coast and it was one of  the central port stops for a lot of the 
none	 trade routes making their way to the coast then it was  taken by the revelry and they reinforced it and made it defensible they didnt slaughter everyone  there because they werent there to kill everyone they were there to take it over they  killed those who were in their opinion incorrectly placed in charge any dissenters and  then anybody who agreed to join the revelry join or die type circumstance everyone who had  previously been at the island were absorbed into the revelry some of them have continued their  life there some of them 
none	 their bloodline has continued to be those that maintain other forms of  business not everyone is technically a pirate there are a lot of members of the revelry that are  just civilians of darktow and maintain the island  travis there was a lot of assimilation here  taliesin like orlando  matt laughs sure  laughter  taliesin not everyones a retired person or a college student somebodys got to actually clean  that place up  laughter  sam we love you orlando  matt yes  taliesin i really do i have plans  laughter 
tavern	  matt hear that taliesin has plans for you orlando  taliesin deep plans  sam if i may  marisha okay  sam heres our options  travis here it is  marisha do you have a powerpoint  sam i dont but ive been thinking about things  travis how drunk are you  sam im lit im tight but feeling good  taliesin amigo  sam our intent is to get off this island without tiffany correct  marisha mmhmm well i think its less about getting off this island without tiffany and more  about getting 
none	 to that shipwreck first before her  travis i think thats the highest priority the only thing that we havent discerned from tiffany  is if she knows where the next  sam apricot  travis no we know where the apricot might be where the next apricot tree might be  sam fruit stand apricot tree  travis or fruit stand i like it  sam heres our options im just putting them out there i put no weight on any of them we can  follow tiffany tomorrow as she goes about her day we can get in 
none	 touch with this allison person  follow her  marisha bitch  sam i know right  laughter  travis well if you used her right name  sam we could talk to some of tiffanys crew right bouldergut seems dumb  laura you shouldnt use her real name  travis yeah wow  sam sorry franklin delano roosevelt seems dumb  laughter  sam also the former quartermaster theodore roosevelt  laughter  sam then theres this sorris fellow i dont know he didnt seem like hes be a font of any knowledge  laura i like him  
none	 sam we can sabotage tiffanys ship i dont know what that would do because we need it to get off  the island we could frame tiffany for some crime against another pirate we have a signature from  tiffany in a letter that she wrote we have that is all that we have  marisha well shes not currently at her ship im assuming a lot of her valuable information is  locked away in her captains quarters somewhere on tiffanys ship if we can get the information to  the next apricot tree then do we need tiffany 
none	 anymore  laura i just remembered  sam what  laura well i have this new spell that the traveler was telling me about it lets you pop in  somewhere you can just pop in and then you can bring somebody with you its like a doorway  sam you could pop in where to her ship to her captains quarters  laura i would pop into her office  sam on the ship on the tiffany ship  marisha how far  liam how far away can you do a popin  laura thats a really good question 
none	 let me think about it hey traveler how far away can i use  this spell 500 whole feet he says  sam thats a lot  marisha thats a lot of feet so many feet look if ive learned anything about important people  its that they cant resist putting shit down on paper i guarantee you theres something in her office  laura i dont know how we would get out of it once i was in there though because i can only use  it once but i suppose  sam you can just leave  laura 
none	 yeah but wouldnt somebody be keeping watch on the ship though  sam but its our ship we work on the ship  marisha do we have credentials do we have like badges like beepbeep  matt no  travis well i can tell you that her quarters have a balcony  marisha oh can you  liam we could also potentially send frumpkin with a note or letter  laura and do what  liam leave it  sam you mean like plant something  marisha no i want to get something  sam rifle through her stuff  
none	 travis yeah because if we are planning to leave without her that means shell give chase i  mean i hate to even suggest it but id rather not have someone hot on our tail  liam also this leads me to a question i have which is instead of discussing the short term  which we want to do i want to ask you about the long term if we ditch tiffany and we find the  apricot tree what happens then like what is your plan with this apricot i think we have ideas  about what could 
none	 come from it shes done what she did at the first tree and you got the next tree  and maybe she races to the what happens next fjord like i know you are curious but what is  the plan  laura should we be using your name or should we call you something else right now too  marisha tusktooth  liam well call him honda  marisha so many nicknames  taliesin im lost  travis well as honda i would race to the apricot and seize it so that she cant pick that  fruit keep 
none	 it for ourselves in our fruit basket and make off and decide if were going to make  marmalade later or not  taliesin i like marmalade  liam do you know how at the first tree an apricot was picked and things shook something  happened there this place was all about drei the number three so you want to go pluck another  fruit and thats two out of three and what happens once the third  travis we actually dont know where the other tree is yet thats the thing we just know where  the fruit 
none	 is  marisha personally i feel more comfortable with honda controlling the supply of apricots than tiffany  travis theyre in season right now  liam i am not telling any of you especially you what to do here but an alternative plan is to get  rid of anyone who knows about the location of the tree and bury the tree  marisha the tree we just came from or the tree that were going to  travis if we do that we might need to ask tiffany if she knows the location of the tree  because it 
none	 hasnt been brought up as of yet  marisha fuck asking tiffany any questions we break into breakfast at tiffanys and get the  information that we need  taliesin that was a long walk  travis it was a long walk but were all on the same page okay are we up for a little be  marisha eyy this is my specialty  travis in real life or the game  marisha no comment i plead the fifth  laura will we be using the fancy doorway  marisha i think to get in yeah  travis yeah 
none	 absolutely dont you have another way to make a door  taliesin thats in an emergency  laura well yes but that is  sam that would be permanent  laura thats the thing she would definitely see there was a new door  marisha also you said there was a balcony right  travis yeah  marisha was there a door to the balcony do you think that would be locked  travis i mean there was a door was it solid wood or did it have glass  matt no it had two glass doorways like windows but 
none	 they open like doors and latch shut  sam wait if you could get in to her cabin you can disguise self as well right you could change  yourself to vera or something  marisha or to avantika  sam or to avantika or vera  marisha i mean tiffany  sam oh shit shit  marisha fuck we were doing so well  matt roll initiative  marisha whos here  sam you could turn yourself into franklin delano roosevelt you could walk off the ship and no one  would think the wiser or they might say 
none	 franklin delano roosevelt why are you on  tiffanys ship youd be like bitch i work here  taliesin why are there two of you here  sam im franklin delano roosevelt  taliesin franklin and eleanor roosevelt and then youre two people on a ship and youre involved in  things and i mean its a good emergency plan but can you only go once you cant go twice  laura i cant go twice i can just do it once  liam what if some of us kept avantika busy  laura tiffany  liam this is difficult 
none	  taliesin a few of us were eating apricots at the time  liam what if fjord keeps tiff busy  sam honda  liam man oh man  laura honda keeps tiffany busy  liam what if the green guy and the gal are busy you follow  marisha do we need to have honda distract tiffany can we not do this right now while shes  theoretically sleeping  liam let me finish the thought you do that thing you take your little doorway over you do  what you want to do then poof you are tiffany 
none	 you walk off the boat because tiffany is busy  marisha thats true he could be accountable  liam 100 busy not maybe busy maybe shes sleeping maybe shes out for a walk  marisha for sure busy we could have this guy with frumpkin making sure that theyre busy if  youre comfortable with that you dont have a lot of a choice  sam can you keep tiffany busy for you know 15 or 20 minutes  travis sure  sam 25 if you really had to take a break  travis maybe with a short rest maybe 
none	  liam its real quiet at this table  laughter  sam this is a good plan and were going to go in there oh youre going to go in there do you  need some help  laura i should bring somebody with me  marisha this is my forte man  laura okay me and you beau  marisha okay  sam except beau cant make herself look like anything else  marisha but if im with the queen then what does it matter  travis whos the queen in this scenario  sam and marisha tiffany  
none	 sam fake tiffany  laura you dont want yourself connected with this at all  marisha i could take the thats a good point fuck  laura plus heres the thing caduceus is really perceptive  travis the two clerics are not going on the mission together  sam i can break into things  laura thats true  taliesin youre very sneaky  liam youre small  sam i can also talk to caleb  liam thats also true  marisha how are you going to get off the boat  sam i can make myself look like something 
none	  laura thats true you could be sorris  travis doesnt ipsis small like  matt ipess ipess is a gnome yeah  sam i could be ipess  laura ipess thats right  taliesin i can give you guys enhanced ability too for the remains of the evening you can pick  something and both of you if you want to be better at something for a little while  laura we never get into trouble together i mean this is foolproof  sam it cannot fail  laura any time weve tried to do anything together it went 
none	 off seamlessly  sam this is the best plan weve ever had  travis thats a natural one this is going to fucking suck  laughter  travis all right okay  marisha what are me and cad doing  sam we need someone just off the boat in case things go awry ill message you that we need some  help on the inside and there needs to be someone on the outside of honda and tiffany in case he  needs some help in there i dont know  travis no  marisha cad can you go with 
none	 honda  taliesin i wouldnt know how to help with that  marisha you have to be nearby  taliesin it also seems like a lot of commitment but okay i can keep an eye on that  travis also where are we staying tonight are we staying at the bloated cup or we finding  laura we could stay on the boat that would solve all of our problems  marisha can we  travis on tiffanys ship  laura i mean weve been staying on it already dont we have quarters on there  matt i mean there 
tavern	 are quarters on there you can stay in yes  sam where were we meant to stay where are the other crew staying on the ship or on land  matt youre not sure some of them you saw found rooms up top above the tavern you were in others  left for the night you dont know where they went  travis it might not be a bad idea to find a room thats not at the bloated cup and not on the ship  just so were not suspicious  taliesin have we seen anything around like another 
tavern	 tavern or something maybe a little i hate  to say more upscale but cleaner  matt not really not here  taliesin something with less piles of shit behind it  matt no you get the sense that darktow doesnt have a lot of offerings for travelers since most  of the travelers that come through here are part of the revelry only a few of them stay offshore  you passed a number of homes of people that live here or spend a lot of time here and have in a boat  travis how do you feel 
none	 about rooms at the bloated cad  taliesin yes  travis three rooms  taliesin three rooms  travis hopefully some with windows  sam sure  travis smells like shit in there  laura we all wait until fjord starts boning and then we start our action  marisha how about this caleb and caduceus and fjord youre one team you have frumpkin watch  fjord you give me the word when its good to go ill deliver that to nott and jessie they go  laura this is way more complicated than i thought it was going to 
none	 be  taliesin i dont know actually im following it actually for the first time this entire  marisha ill give you the signal you guys go ill be nearby ill distract any guards if need  be with my feminine wiles and then you let me know if theres any emergency  sam youre the runner  marisha then i will have no means to communicate with anybody else but you will  sam sure  taliesin youll be a good go between if we hear something bad we can get an owl to ship if you  hear 
none	 something then  marisha actually thats a good point how far away is the bloated cup from the boat  matt from the boat the bloated cup is right off from where all the docks join and from the  shipyard so its maybe about 300 feet away  marisha oh thats amazing cool perfect  travis famous last words  marisha good it might be our downfall but its great  matt all right  marisha okay so ill try and be within eyeshot of the bloated cup within eyeshot of you  sam honda are you going to 
none	 be able to  travis look ill be fine ill make sure shes occupied  sam im just saying theres gonna be a peeping tom in the room with you  travis now what do you mean in the room  sam i think we need frumpkin in there  taliesin no  travis what form is frumpkin an octopus  sam a peeping tomcat  travis is he there  liam hes right here  marisha oh hes been in my  matt you see this really uncomfortably frazzled owl thats been jammed in a pocket  marisha sorry 
none	 i dont  travis am i carrying him in like its no big  taliesin no i dont think we  sam no he can fly outside the window and peek in just to see if youre  laura avantika knows i mean tiffany knows that that owl is yours caleb its not like its a  secret if shes seen the owl before shes going to know youre spying on her  taliesin we dont need to actually know whats going on in there why does anybody need to know that  travis yeah i dont think so listen 
none	 lets just kick this thing off ill toss frumpkin back to  caleb look i leave this in your capable hands  liam well frumpkin has had a peek inside of her quarters after she has seen him she did not see  him the first time although to be doubly sure i could change his shape again  taliesin well i think the thing to do here i mean it just makes sense is that if you leave  the room for any reason we send frumpkin to the ship they see frumpkin they know its time to  
none	 marisha to get out  taliesin thats the signal  travis if for some reason tiffanys on the move or if something seems up listen for thunder how  about that  marisha here i slip caduceus a few of those firecrackers that i have  laura his boning makes thunder  sam whats the source of the thunder is that like  laura his weenie  travis nothing i could say would beat that so  liam but you know if were not comfortable i could change frumpkin to be say a raven or something  travis sure whatever 
none	 you feel is best  marisha how long will that take  travis all right here we go i head off towards the bloated cup  laura we head towards the ship  marisha break  laura we walk towards the ship  matt as you begin to settle towards your directions for the evening here under the shadow  of moonlit mist within the pirate city of darktow were going to go ahead and take a break  well be back here in a little bit to see how this  marisha this is either the best plan or 
none	 the worst plan  matt im excited to see what the fuck is going to happen next before we leave we do have our  wyrmwood giveaway our fantastic friends at wyrmwood have brought this fantastic oh this is  pretty wood this is a lacewood tabletop dice tray it looks like bronze dragonhide the way it  looks against the its so pretty leather inside there its awesome one lucky winner will have  this at the end of the break jump over into the critical role twitch chat thats  twitchtvcriticalrole to enter the codeword tonight is pirates 
none	 plural pirates enter the  word once to enter any more than that and unfortunately youll be disqualified only people  in the us and canada excluding quebec can enter because of stupid international gifting contest  rules anyway well be back here in a moment with the winner see you then  break  matt and welcome back everyone before we get to it we do have our winner of the fantastic  lacewood tabletop dice tray from our friends at wyrmwood it is emperorgeiserick  emperorgeiserick congratulations well get your info and get this sent out to you 
none	 asap well done  hope you enjoy bringing us into the moment as you guys scatter to your various plans  marisha its a great plan  matt we have fjord going to the upper floor of the bloated cup what are the rest of you doing at  this moment  travis real confident real strong  taliesin im staying downstairs to wait for you to either come down or for her to leave im going  to sit and probably try and find something nonalcoholic to drink so i dont have to be an idiot  liam thats 
none	 where its going to go down is in the bloated cup  taliesin upstairs  liam i thought maybe it would say like maybe you know romantic on the boat but great good so  if thats the case then im not getting into that room i think that i should tail this team  instead if youve got an eye on the exit to that building  taliesin let me see yeah  laura shouldnt you be able to message nott and say shes on the move if  liam yeah  laura so maybe stay close where you 
none	 can see it if she leaves  liam yeah  matt okay yasha is doing what as part of this  taliesin i think yasha is probably either with you shes either with you or with us i imagine  matt probably with you shes a bit conspicuous if things go really bad shell be ready to help  out on that side of things  travis if bouldergut is in the bloated cup thats where yasha is  matt there you go  marisha i turn my cloak insideout to the inconspicuous side and case towards the docks  
none	 and start casing the area for revelry that are guarding the area or potentially a good place  for them to do the thing  matt make a perception check  travis is somebody aiding you in that no  marisha 13  matt 13 okay looking out along the docks there are two particular watchouts that are assigned to  that particular part of the docks where the squalleater is currently wet anchored you also  see two individuals on the deck of the ship not holding torches but you can see them through the  fog one of 
none	 them walks and moves thats what you see  marisha do i see anything that looks like it could be a potentially good area for them to cast  a spell without being noticed  matt the docks are pretty open here there isnt much of a place to hide this isnt a major  shipping region most everything is taken off the docks and off the ships and then brought into  shore so there isnt a bunch of errant piles of boxes and barrels per se the docks are pretty  open best bet would be somehow under 
none	 the docks but most of that is in the ocean or trying your  best to wait for a moment when people arent paying attention  marisha okay i block around as to not look like its going the same way that i just came from and  catch back up with these two with the detectives  matt all right as you guys are having this conversation beauregard manages to circle back  and come back to you  marisha all right theres two guards casing the dock and two of avantikas tiffanys people on  the ship it 
none	 looks pretty open we might want to find an alternative for you guys to not be noticed  as you do the crazy magic thing  sam it looks open  marisha its super open two guards guarding the dock and two people on the deck of tiffanys ship  sam getting on is not a problem  laura yeah we can just go to our quarters or something  marisha to then bamf over our quarters in the  sam inside the ship  laura yeah what do you think  marisha okay  sam we can just be 
none	 there  marisha you guys are going to have to talk to guards and convince yourself on the way in and you  will be noticed  sam no we just are in  laura because its our ship  sam what do you mean  marisha were talking about two different things here  sam please start over again  marisha there are two guards guarding the docks there are two people on the ship of avantikas  bo of tiffanys boat on the de you get what im saying the deck of the ship of the boat  
none	 sam uhhuh  travis its real sotto so we dont have to use code words anymore  marisha if you all want to just walk on to your quarters you will have two guards and two of our  crew members who will see you walk on  liam i think what beaus implying is perhaps its better that were never seen there at all  marisha we hide somewhere and were never seen at all and youll bamf in unless you disguise  yourself as tiffany now then i would say we find a hidden place potentially in our 
tavern	 private  quarters in the bloated cup that you bamf into  laura is it within 500 feet of  marisha he said it was within 300  laura fuck yeah yeah lets go to our quarters in the bloated cup  sam were going to start the bamf there  laura start it in the tavern  marisha i will be nearby near the docks signal if you need me  sam you wont see us ever  marisha good  liam here is how i would like to contribute first im going to disguise myself when it is 
none	  time not yet but i will make myself look like voice actor charlie adler i will be  saltandpepper ill fit right in on the docks  matt oh youll fit right in in darktow  liam i wont be in a denim tuxedo but i will wear traditional pirate garb  travis hes our type man he thinks sleeves are bullshit too  liam they are bullshit there will be no sleeves on this disguise im going to hang out between  the bloated cup and the ship looking like charlie frumpkin i will just have circle a 
none	  continuous circle above the whole area so i can see the guards on the boat and we can message  each other ja ill just be eyes in the sky charlie on the ground  matt you got it all right  taliesin hows a dex bonus go for you hows an advantage on dex or do you already have  sam i mean i have very high dexterity  laura could always use advantage  sam okay  taliesin less that could possibly go wrong so before they go in im going to cast enhance  ability on 
none	 these two at a level three so i get two people  sam maybe charisma  marisha yeah for the deception  sam leaving  taliesin thats fair all right  sam i can already dex my way around  laura we could potentially jump out the window too  sam but you cant  laura what are you talking about  sam are you dextrous  laura im so dextrous  taliesin it also will give you zero damage for a 20foot fall if i give you a dex bonus but  sam i have feather fall  taliesin

town	 is the best character ever  matt glancing over you dont see any torchbearing guards but you do see a figure that  is doing a visual pass on the deck of the ship  taliesin i might see if theres a torchbearer walking around really quickly  matt you see one thats maybe 25 30 feet from you thats just walking through the street  taliesin excuse me sir  matt turns around hey  taliesin we had a little trouble on our ship earlier i was curious if everything was all  right i heard a little commotion 
none	  matt i dont know its not my jurisdiction tonight  taliesin well if i wanted to find out what went down do you know who i would talk to  matt probably one of the guys closer to the ship  taliesin ill be right back  matt okay  taliesin im going to go find a guard and ask them whats up  matt okay  sam hey just throwing it out there there seemed to be a couple of loose ends that we need to tie  up can you make us an alibi  laura what

none	  marisha jesus thats a natural one  matt you only see one figure you recognize from the crew  marisha oh sorry its a four ten  matt okay you only see one figure that you recognize from the crew and they are recovering  from a series of stab wounds and are deep in their cups  marisha oh whatshisname  matt waldok  marisha i sit down next to waldok with another drink and hand him a drink  matt he takes it and goes thanks hiccup  marisha holy shit man i am so sorry we 
none	 couldnt have been there to protect you from these attackers  matt attackers its just fucking him he points over at the other guy whos just like  stop rubbing it in im sorry you fucking jumped into the middle of my room at night while i was  sleeping what else am i supposed to do hes like not stab me asshole  marisha whos the other guys name  matt thats zoen  marisha im sorry we couldnt have been there to protect you from zoen what a dick i mean we  were here all night fucking 
tavern	 trashed so if we had only been there  sam the best  matt make a deception check  liam the slow creep on your face matt come on high  marisha 15 couldve been better  matt okay you talk to them about how youre sad you couldnt have been there you can see waldoks like  marisha we were drunk here  matt waldoks not really caring as much more just like no its fucking his fault and  zoens like oversharing caduceus  taliesin i just want to find out what was up from somebody  matt 
none	 one of the guards is keeping an eye over there with the torch hes like yeah it looks  like theres a breakin of some sort a guy was stabbed got him safe another man broke his  fucking leg and hes being taken care of  taliesin really does he need healing i can do that or otherwise  matt sure i guess this way  taliesin yeah ill take care of it real quick  matt he brings you over to the dock and you look over and theres this guy you know his name is  bart 
none	 hes one of the deckhands and hes over on the side right now just going pained groaning  and you can see its snapped like bone protruded and everything  travis oh compound  taliesin oh in that case healing word level three  matt okay you may have to set the bone first  all woo  matt make a medicine check  taliesin make a medicine check  sam dont accidentally turn it to fungus  taliesin yeah thatll do thats a 23  laura oh  taliesin i love this character so much  matt you walk 
none	 up to him and hes like no no no no  taliesin its all right  matt pained gasp relieved gasp  taliesin there you go  matt gasp he looks down and you can see theres a wave of relief on him as he doesnt have this  like protruding fracture its set still you can see the bone but its much betterlooking than it was  taliesin lets give him a cure wounds level three just to  matt go for it  taliesin or what does he look like a level two or a level three to 
none	 you  matt with that medicine check a level two should be sufficient  taliesin a level two should be sufficient all right lets just take care of this can you tell  me what happened son  matt i dont know i was up in the crows nest and suddenly it  taliesin 21  matt 21 suddenly its oh my god thank you  taliesin while you were up the crows nest what happened  matt it was catching fire i was trying to put it out but it just kept growing and growing and i  could 
none	 feel the heat and it was  taliesin it looks fine up there  matt i know i dont  taliesin what did you what was the last 24 hours for you what did you  matt what do you mean  taliesin i mean like i dont oh no  matt what  taliesin sighs i may have left some of the fruit that we picked up in our last stop in the  kitchen i dont know what youve been eating for the last thats maybe my fault i really hope it  isnt but  matt make 
none	 a deception check  taliesin seven  matt he goes like no i dont think its that it was sudden and it was intense and then it was  gone its fucking crazy  taliesin im going to be worried im going to check to make sure ive got all this just in  case because that sounds awfully familiar do you need a drink  matt yeah  taliesin come on were going to bring you back its okay  matt groans he stands up and like hes leaning on you for support but once he gets to his 
none	 foot  its fine and hes like oh man  taliesin poor guy come on  matt all right you lead him over  taliesin im bringing back im going to just sort of yeah bring him back and then tell everybody  matt some of the port guard are like going through the ship now and theyre going through  taliesin im definitely going to tell everyone my fruit theory because im down a fruit  travis well shall we you know turn in for the night seems like its been a crazy one  sam sure has  
none	 taliesin im tired  liam charlie adler concurs  laughter  taliesin hes very stern for charlie adler  liam no its caleb  travis well all pile into one room before we separate for the night  matt okay you all gather into one of the chambers  marisha we kind of stagger a bit though  laura should we look around the room and make sure nobody can spy on us look for peepholes in  the room  marisha look for invisible peoples in the room  matt make a perception check  sam ill do the 
none	 same  travis or how about  marisha fucking fuck seven  matt lucky seven  taliesin dont you have a spell you can cast that solves this problem  matt the room seems fairly secure  liam that what detects a problem  laura that keeps sound in  travis whatd you find  sam good stuff  travis oh okay  sam we got a book well i dont have it  laura we got a book nott found it  sam can any of you read this  travis well first  marisha i look over his 
none	 shoulder  matt okay it has some sketches in it the language appears to be some sort of either a  cipher or a personal shorthand what languages do you know  liam wherever they are celestial common sylvan with my experience tinkering with  comprehend languages would i believe this is something i could  matt probably yeah  liam yeah all right i begin casting the ritual spell  marisha i know deep speech  travis was it hidden where you found it should we detect to see if it has magic anyway like a  trace on 
none	 it  sam it was hidden behind a panel like a false panel in the wall  laura yeah  taliesin if you just bring everything out really quickly ill cast detect magic on there  sam oh nice  travis yeah just empty your pockets lets just make sure nobodys following this stuff  liam itll take me 11 minutes to be able to read this if i can  taliesin ill cast detect magic in the meantime  sam theres these jewels too  laura when we were looking for letters and words and stuff we ended up 
none	 breaking her desk and we  stole a bunch of jewels  travis thats not as lofi as we were discussing  laura well and then the room filled with poison and then we put a hole in the floor and we fell  marisha oh  sam then we caused another guard to stab someone and another guard to jump to his death  travis we saw them  taliesin nah hes fine  laura then we jumped in the water and we got away  marisha thats pretty awesome  laura the thing is though avantikas going to 
none	 definitely know that somebody stole her stuff  sam but we can turn this problem into a probletunity and we can take these jewels that  she will definitely know came from her and plant them on someone else to just sort of we could  plant them on this allison person who she doesnt like already  marisha she is a bitch  sam or maybe on one of her own crew and have them killed  travis yeah well isnt allison not cool with avantika and the enemy of my enemy is my friend  right so why 
none	 would we want to get allison in trouble  sam oh  travis yeah  taliesin oh wow  sam we could plant them on someone that we dont like  travis sure yeah  laura and travis but who  sam how about jamedi cosko i dont like that guy  laura i like jamedi i thought he was nice  travis maybe we just hold onto them for now they came in containers right  laura well yeah but  sam we dont want to hold on  laura if we hold on and avantikas like lets everybody 
none	 empty their pockets and we have them  sam yeah these are hot rocks here  travis are they just gems or are they specific pieces of jewelry  taliesin were literally looking at them right now and i detected magic before we opened the boxes  matt okay you open the boxes theyre a series of gems some rougher and probably been scrounged  up and found that are with some scrapes imperfect but still valuable maybe three of them that are  still well cut and have not been given any abrasions there is a dull green jade 
none	 necklace  that does emit a minor magical essence to it  taliesin that ones got a little bit of tingle to it id be worried about that one why dont you  take a look at that really quickly  liam caleb is not listening to anyone he is sprinkling pinches of salt and soot in a circle  around the book  taliesin that books not worth its circle of salt  sam we could destroy these gems and smash them up into smaller gems  travis if youre going to plant them on anybody vera would be 
none	 a good candidate  sam vera why do you think vera  travis well because shes a bitch we got to get her out of here shes you know wants my job  sam isnt that just because you stole her job that seems like a legitimate beef  laura i think shes in love with avantika too  sam how do you know that  laura because she pulled me aside and she was like i dont like fjord and ill kill him if you  want me to  sam she said shes going to kill him  
none	 taliesin perception check insight check  matt make an insight check make a deception check  taliesin im pretty low so what do you got  laura eight  taliesin 13  matt you can tell that shes lying  laura okay so maybe she didnt say that but i still dont think she likes fjord very much  sam well then we should roast her  travis yeah were definitely going to plant it on her cause some commotion at the top caleb  what do you got  liam mutters  travis oh it hasnt been time  
none	 matt well say by now youve completed it  liam well its up to you  matt i know so you can respond  liam poof all the soot and salt ignites and then suddenly whoa whats it say  matt as you go through it its hard to follow since its shorthand like its broken sentences  and its pieces they look to be notes from dreams  marisha oh shit  sam that could be good stuff  marisha gasp yes yes it could  travis ooh  marisha its got the apricot tree  travis please be 
dung	 an almanac sorry  matt it goes through discussions of mentions of vandren mentions of being given the mark the  eye on her person after a ritual that was shown to her by vandren the dreams began the dreams  involved this great eye coming to her with phrases written down provoke consume learn  reward it begins to discuss images that involve having to fight through dark waters having to  follow signs being promised power with gifts and actions that show leadership and drive towards  this entity it spoke about vandren guiding her and then spoke 
none	 about him getting cold feet spoke  on him mistrusting the dreams and his weakness it spoke on an attempt to then gift vandren as a  sacrifice but he got away  liam so caleb would seeing this play out as he reads would explain it all very carefully and  delicately because he knows how conflicted a subject how charged a subject it would be for  fjord but does tell everyone in the room everything  matt then discusses the search for vandren for months and months to no avail eventually  changing focus to instead continue 
none	 to improve the joyous boons and earn the yellow light of the  eye more dreams with patterns of figures in her way people that were close to her that she felt  were barricades chains that held her back and getting rid of them youre not entirely certain  what getting rid of them means but at least out of the path finding others that begin to also  learn of the joys and the promise of ruling the sea and how no matter how much darktow is the  center of the revelry and the power of the 
none	 plank king who can possibly not choose to bend the knee  to those who control the oceans they sail on it then goes on to talk about other notes and  scavenged bits talking about the finding of urukaxl of the difficulties in hiring people that  would go there the hiring of jamedi to search out finally over time you find some other notes  about another location from another dream she had that involves three land masses of different  shapes theres a few notes and questions around it but one of them is saying archipelago  
none	 seems to mark these as a possible  sam theres three land masses right there  marisha nah  liam shes cooked  matt then it goes into a few brief phrases about the newcomers discussing how the mist was taken  its not a lot written in this page  sam which ones her favorite  matt all it says is ive found another chosen perhaps this one will be more useful than vandren  sam and i fucked him  matt it does not say that thats where the notes finish  liam minor detail in calebs deciphering 
none	 of all the fragments was there any sense that there was  any kind of romantic relationship between avantika and vandren or its unclear  matt it is very unclear  liam okay  travis what language was that in  taliesin what was the necklace while were here  matt its a personal cipher  travis oh  liam yeah her own cipher  travis thats not great for us  liam thats not helpful at all  taliesin well really whats the necklace before we go any further to make sure its not a  comefindmyshit  liam 
none	 which necklace would that be  laura the jade necklace  liam first time im seeing it not really but just give me ten minutes  taliesin is there any part in the book that is actually a cipher for its own okay  matt glancing through it looks like you either learn it here or whatever it would be used to try  to decode it is not present in the book  sam i dont want to say that were the best detectives because thats already  laura a given  sam  established fact but could this 
none	 be that we just got promoted  laura to what  sam commissioner i dont know could be we just cracked the case again  laura cracked the case fjord are you as crazy as she is because holy shit  liam heres the question could brainiac caleb with this book which is her own coded cipher  comprehend languages with enough time try to study the recurrence of vowel sounds consonance sounds  and try to create a key to this book  matt you get the sense that this written cipher is not a verbal language it is 
none	 specifically  written for her own notes and own purpose  liam yeah  matt so you couldnt speak it but if you want to go ahead and decode it  liam but people break codes  matt yeah im saying you couldnt it wouldnt be able tosorry i misunderstood you couldnt  speak it go ahead and make an intelligence check  taliesin it would be amazing if you pulled this off  liam ive rolled shit all night every roll  travis youre due one  taliesin but not this one  liam natural 20  cheering  
none	 matt fuck dude fuck  travis rise baby rise  matt what does that put you at a total  liam oh pretty good straight intelligence right  matt correct  liam 28  matt intelligence modifier is eight  liam yeah it bumped up to 20 when i leveled up  matt it would be plus five then  laura not your saving throw  liam saving throw sorry i was looking at the wrong place thats correct 25  matt that is exactly the dc you would have needed to do this it is set at a very 
none	 hard dc you only  could have done this with a 20 you motherfucker  laura you have maxed out intelligence  matt goddamn it okay all right no here we go itll take you the better part of the night you  probably wont sleep which means you wont get your spells back  taliesin take a second to identify the necklace so we dont get  sam dont bother him  travis what if the necklace as a trace on it  taliesin yeah  matt itll take you the night to complete it you will not be 
none	 able to sleep which means you wont  get your spells back and youll suffer a point of exhaustion  liam thats fine i would like to because i was asking you a question and then suddenly it was  happening right  matt im just letting you what would take you know you can do this  liam lets say caduceus gives caleb the necklace hell take ten minutes to figure out what this  jade necklace is and spend the night decoding this book  sam wow  marisha holy shit  sam best plan ever  travis 
none	 o for six in the series and you crank one at the bottom of the ninth  marisha you got a book  liam its not a book  laura thats a necklace  liam its a necklace  travis oh wow  marisha but you still get a book  matt immediate excitement and disappointment  marisha you still get a book though thats what i was saying  taliesin heres the thing are we going to remove the mention of you from the book  laura it doesnt say the name  liam just says found someone special 
none	  taliesin theres no way of inferring within the book  matt it doesnt have the name fjord  taliesin but it doesnt connect the newcomers to the new chosen  matt hmm  taliesin one could not infer that the new chosen was part of the newcomers from the way she wrote  it or no is it separated thoughts  matt not necessarily  taliesin all right worstcase scenario is we could mend a page and it will remove the ink if we  want to delete anything  liam this is like that around your neck except 
none	 its specific to warding off poison no poison  taliesin its very helpful that might be either  liam it could help any one of us really would you like it nott  sam its pretty oh but wait its a hot rock  travis were not keeping anything on our persons we need to hide it bury it  taliesin in the best case scenario i would say if we could hide this is someone elses room  underneath their bed  sam we could put it in the bag of holding or whatever  taliesin i would love 
none	 for these to be in somebody elses room  travis uhhuh you dump that bag out or just go searching for a necklace stick your hand it it  comes right out  laura itll come right out  liam i say we tie it to a rock and drop the rock off a specific dock and maybe were lucky and  its still there later  travis or we could oldschool bury it under a tree right mark it same diff  taliesin its still going to be findable to anybody whos looking for it though i would  
none	 really recommend putting it i dont know somewhere where we dont mind it being very  specifically found especially if were trying to  travis frame somebody  taliesin well i hate to put it that way but uh i dont know this seems  travis well listen i am all for putting vera in a bad light right avantika is going to want to  know who did this yeah tiff old tiff fanny might as well put it on her right  sam do we know where shes staying which room shes in  travis no  liam 
none	 we have to be able to have someone point the finger at her though because what happens if she  finds it herself later  taliesin that doesnt matter its still in her room  liam but if she finds it she could throw it out she could sell it she could say i found this in  my room i mean thats unpredictable i mean we cant control that  travis no but maybe were thinking too smallball if you can actually make a translation  of that thing thats the frame weve been looking for we take that 
none	 to the plank king were going  to get all the head start we can get we know where the other peach tree is now so  marisha mmmhmm  laura apricots fjord  travis its apples and peaches so you know  marisha between apples and peaches  taliesin we have to make sure that you survive long enough to get it there i mean i wish youd  just grabbed the book that would make life more easy  laura if i know we shouldnt have grabbed everything  sam what the jewels we can just throw them 
none	 in the ocean  laura we could just throw them in the ocean  travis yeah  sam we could snoop we could wait until we see vera at breakfast tomorrow and just right shes  staying here  travis yeah i think its too dangerous to try and plant it on her its adding one step that we  dont need  marisha i agree with that  travis i think we take it once youre finished  liam this is the key anything else is a distraction can only cause wrinkles so we ditch  it maybe somewhere 
none	 where it can be found again but it is not as important as this book is so we  solve this and her goose is cooked  marisha yeah  travis yeah i agree  sam except if we bring this to the plank king its admitting that we broke into the ship and  stole it  marisha we dont need to take that to the plank king if caleb knows the language  taliesin yeah we do  liam we do though  sam we do  marisha why she could ford anything that we want forge she 
none	 could forge  taliesin we still need to prove the book  sam we still need proof that this came from her that she wrote this  marisha we have her signature lets forge it  sam but thats fake  taliesin thats too much i feel like we can take the book to him i think if we say that we knew  about the plot we suspected and were looking for proof  sam yeah thats good i like that  liam i have a question for the group because i dont remember did beauregard share with the 
none	  group that she got tapped by the plank king  sam she wouldve shared that right  marisha i probably would have yeah  matt well now would be the time to share it if you hadnt  marisha so by the way i got tapped on the shoulder by the plank king hes looking for dirt  on avantika  sam what  marisha i know totally mindblowing i know you had no clue  travis i dont think it does right as beau has appropriately stated many times snitches get  stitches if we walk that in 
none	 there the plank king might just be looking for disloyal motherfuckers  to hang up by their toes we need to find a way to either message that to send via messenger with  the book and a codex that youve created and let him be able to see the evidence for himself  sam we could drop it in allisons mailbox and say hey heres all the proof you need to destroy avantika  marisha i dont think we need to do that i think we just drop it in the plank kings  travis were assuming that she 
none	 wants to destroy her  sam well did you see the way they looked at each other  travis yeah maybe they need to yowl get it on you know  liam maybe we send frumpkin with this stuff in tow to his little perch with a note an anonymous note  laura yeah i like it  marisha i think we copy the contents of the book  taliesin we have a copy of the contents of the book  laura calebs brain  marisha thats what im saying we copy the contents of the book  travis a 
none	 physical copy or up in the dome  liam i have a copy in my noodle  marisha sure as long as you think itll last there  liam ja i can write it down  marisha i will say the plank king offered me some good cash to rat out avantika  sam yeah he was asking for a snitch  marisha he was literally asking for a snitch now  travis true  sam that seems legit that seems legit and honest he was making an honest right did you  get the honest vibe from plankie  
none	 marisha no nothing about any of these people is honest  taliesin i think hed kill both of them i think sending it with just sending it to him and just  giving it to him  liam well it could be an anonymous note or we could send frumpkin once we leave here and you  could sign it from beauregard  taliesin i would almost say if we could give him the whole kit and kaboodle everything that was  stolen top to bottom with a note saying this is the full  marisha i know what to 
none	 sign  liam spill it girl spill it  marisha just write it up and ill sign it  sam ooh who knows what itll be  travis what  sam shes keeping us in suspense  marisha ill simply sign it with how much  travis to go with the package  marisha to go with the package  liam to go with this once i have deciphered it for them  marisha mmhmm unless we want zero implications  travis yeah that swings back to us a little bit  taliesin i say translate the one page give 
none	 the cipher so that they can figure it out on their  own lets give the whole thing to him just all the jewels all the box the whole thing top to bottom  liam avantikas coming for your throat this is the evidence do with it what you will we go to  the pomegranate tree  travis yes yeah i dont know how we get out of here but were going to try  marisha we need the mist  taliesin well be fine  travis well we need to wait until they apprehend her  sam then 
none	 we can take her boat  taliesin then we can take our boat  travis we do something  liam we could also add to this note that frumpkin delivers that avantika here is your proof that  avantika wants your throat the whole crew is complicit  laura were part of the crew  travis oh boy you know okay just throwing it out there big picture okay because there are  two goals on that map one is the peach the other is the peach tree if we go to one and she goes to  the other 
none	 and lets say she gets deferred adjudication and gets out just a little bit after  us she might be waiting for us at one or the other im just saying  sam but then well face her head on  taliesin lets let them make any insinuations they want the crew will fall the way they will  again i think giving too much is too much the guys itching for a reason to get rid of her  lets give him what he wants no conditions no terms nothing  travis lets just do that lets let caleb 
none	 do his thing and well see what the morning does where  are we keeping the gems and everything else in the meantime  taliesin in the safe maybe  sam just one one other consideration  travis the lead safe do we still have that in the bag  matt well the safe in the bag you still have yeah  sam one other consideration just throwing it out there were all spitballing here right  laura big lead safe not in the bag  matt the big one you ordered yeah that wouldnt have gone in there  
none	 laura but the little box that we have the thing in yeah  matt yeah  sam you know that page that you were telling us about that says the three land masses might be  the grand archipelago maybe when youre translating that becomes four land masses and a  different place  taliesin were not going to translate the whole book just one page  travis no if she gets the book back  taliesin well how is she going to get the book back  travis we do have the lead safe the dodecahedrons in it  
none	 sam were going to translate one page  liam no heres the thing if we just give them a page  sam no its got to be the whole book  marisha no no no hes saying we send a cipher and a translated page with the entire book  taliesin does that make sense  marisha so that they can then take the time with their smart people to translate the rest of the book  taliesin hes making the cipher  marisha no he knows the cipher  laura oh no its getting late im getting confused  
none	 liam i am going to make a cipher that can be used to decode this book if we send a cipher and the  book they can take time to read the entire thing  marisha correct  taliesin lets rip a few pages out  liam hmm  marisha theyll be able to tell unless we do jesters hint where we mend a few pages and get  rid of some ink  sam i would mend the page that has the thing about where the peach tree is  marisha so lets just do that and the rest 
none	 of the plan stays the same  travis yeah make it so  liam ja thats good  marisha break  liam but well leave immediately  sam we are so good at this  travis well once shes apprehended  liam correct  travis yeah okay well send some food and water up your way  liam ja goodnight  matt all right so whos holding what  travis the jewels in the containers go in the lead safe  sam where does that go  travis in the bag of holding  matt okay  liam i take

none	 either  stayed somewhere else or was somewhere else when he was gathered up by the crew and the guard the  guard only none of them go on the ship but they lead you over to the edge of the dock and watch  you all go onto the deck and begin to walk away  sam wheres the book right now  liam its in calebs possession isnt it  sam yeah  marisha oh my god  matt okay you guys walk along the plank up onto the deck and there you see avantika vera the

none	 felt more in trouble  sam weve got to get this book off the fucking boat  matt well youre on the deck right now  travis thats the most sure way to get it seen  matt the deck of the squalleater avantika sees you approach and goes good morning everyone  good morning well i apologize for the problems this should only take a moment to discuss it  appears weve a bit of an incident overnight and i wanted to let everyone know there may have been  some issues rifling through over here waldok was so 
none	 unfortunately shivved by one of our  compatriots and shoots a glare over at zoen whos like im sorry im sorry but it has  come to our attention that there has also been well to be perfectly honest a breakin to my  personal chambers  marisha gasp  matt i know some of my personal belongings have gone missing and i wanted to ask if anybody has  seen anything throughout the night i already spoke with a few of the crew who were here before  i have not spoken with you waldok did you see anything 
none	 waldok goes i was sleeping and  suddenly this piece of shit fell through the ceiling and landed on top of me and i was  just it was the other way around waldok got stabbed so waldok goes i was walking and i  heard some noise inside your chambers i went to inspect it unlocked the door went in and things  seemed fine but then i fell through the fucking floor onto zoen and he was sitting in bed  sleeping and he just fucking started stabbing me zoens like you woke me up what am i 
none	  supposed to do and where the fuck are we anyway we looked at the floor and somebody had  broken the floor probably snuck in somehow the captain goes thank you for that also it  appears that bark here had strange delusions and fell or leapt apparently from the crows nest  did you see anything in particular hes like i mean it was crazy it caught fire and then i  jumped to get away from it and there was no fire she goes so it appears that there may  have been some sort of distraction 
none	 well has anybody else seen anything of particular interest  last night and by the way caduceus i heard that you were very helpful in helping our compatriots  with their wounds  taliesin yeah it was no problem  matt i appreciate you being a team player  taliesin well it looked that leg was pretty rough hmm  travis is this a frequent occurrence when youre in darktow this sort of  matt oh certainly not to be perfectly honest whoever did this does not understand the rules of  the city very well  taliesin i can 
none	 no i can find creatures i cant find objects  matt hmm vera veras sitting back there and nods you see her fingers trace this weird symbol  in the air that leaves a slight trace her eyes flare for a second and she goes but that is  okay because i can  liam i take a bit of phosphorus and squelch it through my hand and cast wall of fire across the  entire length of the boat between them and us  travis oh  marisha holy shit  matt thats where were going to pick up
