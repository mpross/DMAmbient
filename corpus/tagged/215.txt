none	 matt all righty announcements are over lets go ahead and get into the game proper  laura oh no  matt so to get us up to speed vox machina the intrepid band of adventurers who have been  enjoying being honorary members of the council of taldorei returning from a harsh adventure in  whitestone having the winters crest festival and then going in and reinspecting the death  place of a blue dragon they once fought over a year ago returned just in time for a series of  chromatic dragons white black red and green all attacking 
none	 emon at once this union of  extremely powerful dragons tore through the city with the red staying behind named thordak the  cinder king basically housing himself in emon and claiming himself essentially ruler of that area  the party fled to their keep attempted to help a bunch of refugees inside and then were immediately  attacked by vorugal the white dragon a heavy battle commenced that was ill in favor of your  victory until thordak himself knocked vorugal out of the sky claiming that there were better things  to be done so three of the 
none	 four of this chroma conclave have now gone east while thordak sits in  the middle of his new nesting place you guys decided to try and help those who were in the keep  at the time those who survived that encounter on the outside of greyskull however percy and grog  had a conversation about this magical skull artifact they had acquired this whispering in  exchange for a wish if it got freed this led to a rather intense bit of conflict  travis negotiation  matt yes laughs which thanks to the luck of the die 
none	 seemed to avoid a unique circumstance  whatever that might have been  travis bullshit  matt laughs however the party in this tense scenario were then visited by a dwarven  elementalist named drake along with your oldtime friend and guide allura vysoren who had sensed  the connection to her teleportation circles here in emon severed immediately there was discussion  about how this came about whos to blame and it appears that this dragon has a history 15 years  before of having conflict with allura and her thenparty of adventurers many of whom lost their  
none	 life in the final battle when they realized they were unable to actually defeat thordak hatched a  plan to seal him within the elemental plane of fire and had managed to keep him there for 15  years until recently we left off with allura suddenly sensing her connection to the westruun  sigil severed as well  laura god i forgot about that  travis nothing like genocide to put you in the mood  matt yeah that is where well pick up so at this point after allura senses this her eyes go  wide for a 
none	 moment and she you being there in front of her still keyleth after your guys  scrying ritual grabs your shoulder and looks around the room who is left where is the  council which allies can we draw to us in hopes of planning our next move  marisha we dont know  travis we are scattered  laura for all we know the council is lost  marisha we could be all thats left  matt sighs well we have to try and gather what information we can about who remains if  anyone out there survives any 
town	 of our allies we need to make sure that theyre brought away from  the center of this chaos and hopefully we can reconvene and figure out a path of hoping to free  our city our entire land of this scourge  laura how do we even make contact with them thordak is in the center of town  matt perhaps skirting the center and hoping others have found their way towards the outskirts  of it i dont know this is as far as ive gotten to the city is your guys keep you have the  better 
town	 position on this where would anyone in the town go are there places to hide are there  liam i think that they would leave the center of the city at least to the edges if not try to get  out though that might be foolish  taliesin check the harbor maybe  laura we know that riskel made secret passageways in different places  travis security tunnels  laura yeah did we ever find out if he put one in ours did we have one that leads into the town  taliesin we dont know  sam oh 
none	 didnt we have a tunnel made that goes under the wall  matt you did actually  marisha but does it lead out into the city  matt you havent actually utilized it yet  liam weve never used it but they described it to us when they brought us here the first day  laura maybe we can sneak in  sam to the city  laura well yeah  liam we need to see if uriel is still alive  sam by the way hi guys  laura hi hows it going  travis wait who was with 
none	 gilmore  laura gilmore disappeared i didnt see where he went  liam he was alone before it all happened  taliesin well thats another place to check  marisha what where gilmores  taliesin im thinking of where i would go if i didnt know what to do  liam thats smart  laura what places are left that have a teleportation circle  sam what about the thieves guild tunnels would anyone go there  marisha it depends on who knows its a way out of the city once again  laura the smugglers coves all of them 
tavern	  taliesin thats not a bad idea either  marisha that was all through the  sam that bar  marisha through the bar in the  sam place with the thing  laura that one  matt the connections i had to this town were within my tower your keep and the lyceum the  alabaster lyceum the lyceum has also been severed and though i know not of what may remain  there that is also a place of great power hence why it was probably a very operative target for  their attack  marisha allura  
none	 matt yes  marisha how far does your arcane connection reach can you feel when you lose connection to  other cities  matt if i have a connection to the sigil yes i dont have much beyond the boundaries of  taldorei vasselheim does not allow sigils for transportation its against their philosophy  against embedded arcane intrusion if westruun is under attack as well i will make my way there in  hopes of salvaging any lives that i can  marisha youre leaving  laura if westruun is under attack now and we know thordak is here 
none	 does that mean  travis his forces are divided  marisha this is a takeover for some reason thordak doesnt want to leave this city why  sam this is the seat of power right  laura we could potentially attack one of his subordinates though one of the other dragons in  westruun by themselves  sam but then he could just come and kill us  laura well then we teleport right back out  sam okay  laura bad idea bad idea  sam how fast is he  marisha well they just made it to westruun 
none	 several hundred miles away in all of 40 minutes  taliesin theres a lot of assumptions here  matt they move rather fast and to be honest i hate to inform you but my single teleportation  ability has been utilized for the day in getting here  laura oh  marisha im tapped out too  travis me too  liam lady allura what do you know of marquet  matt marquet  liam you said that they successfully repulsed him  matt 400 years ago yes when he was younger he was a much smaller dragon then  
none	 liam oh  travis 400 years ago  laura yeah he is ancient grog he is ancient  travis yeah slightly  matt the only thing i can think of there are two bastions of knowledge that hold inklings as to  what could be the undoing of dragonkind of powerful entities there were battles of many such  powerful entities long long ago back before the penance before the historical wiping of  civilization some of these books remain in vasselheim being the only city to have survived  those times a few have found their way in the 
none	 cobalt reserve the library of westruun if i  could go and hope that this library still stands stay out of sight help who i can along the way  and gather what bits of research i can and bring them back here perhaps we could reconvene as long  as you go and find who you can of our allies that survive within emon  laura we can do that  travis within emon  laura yes  sam going to let you go on your own  liam well she has drake with her  matt which drake 
none	 next to her says damn right she does and i dont mean any offence but the  two of us is about the same as you lot  travis say what  matt trust me and he gives you this dwarven grin as both of his eyes spark for a second with  electricity  travis quietly well fuck  matt she pushes him aside and goes its all right drake for our mission its going to  require more success is guided on being subtle some of you excel at that maybe not all and  speed i believe 
none	 we can handle this youre better suited in combing large bits of territory and  seeking the allies that may survive  laura will you be leaving in the morning then can you go tonight  matt i should leave now  marisha youre going to go on foot  matt we have other means of transportation  marisha allura if youre going to westruun and what you say is true that we have two potential  options for finding out how to defeat these dragons should we be heading to vasselheim maybe  thats best where were needed right 
none	 now  matt if vasselheim still stands i knowing its history that is one of the most fortified cities  the most fortified city in our civilization its endured two great wars and has been the starting  point of each cycle i doubt even with the might that these dragons hold they would have the gall  the foolish intent to attack such a place especially the center of an entity such as  bahamut who stands against such creatures i think vasselheim is going to definitely claim a  key role in this attempt to save ourselves  
none	 laura bahamut is a good guy  marisha yeah for the most yeah yeah  laura cool  marisha its the city that was closest to pyrah  matt yes  marisha my people my tribe we could pull double duty we could go and i can  travis heh doody  marisha grog now is not the time  taliesin what of whitestone was there any mention any  matt i have no connection to whitestone i did not have time arriving there to install a sigil  taliesin did you learn anything of the anomaly beneath the castle 
none	 that might be useful  matt she shakes herself in her current mindset and goes well me and drake here we spent the  better part of two days studying the structure underneath the city it itself appears to be at  least 600 years old predating whitestones construction unfortunately both of our magics  are thwarted in the proximity of this structure and any rituals that we attempted or would have  been able to attempt to discern its nature in the classic means would not be functional due to  its antimagical properties however weve taken a few 
none	 things of note and were taking our  observations to reach for two research facilities around the world one of which i intended to be  the cobalt reserve before this happened  taliesin interesting thank you  laura so there was no you didnt move it you didnt do anything with it its still just  sitting there  marisha its a hazard zone right now  matt essentially we have locked it off and its under intense guard we spent a little bit of  time experimenting with its properties and any object of firm matter that was 
none	 introduced to this  object was then torn from our grasp sundered into many pieces and then vanished  marisha yeah  laura maybe we can get thordak near the little orb  sam yeah yeah yeah  laura i like it  taliesin that was definitely what i was thinking  sam how do we do that  taliesin well its part of a plan  travis hey big dragon theres a snack over here take a bite  sam we could leave a trail of gold that leads to it goldilocksstyle  marisha that thing was also several 
none	 hundred feet below ground how are we going to get that dragon  down there  liam does thordak have any offspring  matt not that i know of  laura not anymore  taliesin the thought would be to actually remove it from the chamber maybe  laura that could be really really terrible  travis do dragons have families do they have like wives and loved ones  laura they have children  matt chromatics especially from what i understand in my research they do mate but there  is no family structure there is no love between 
none	 brethren other than the continued existence of  that bloodline if a child of a dragon is slaughtered and one does find out depending on if  its their only brethren it could incite a sense of vengeance depending on the color but i know  of no immediate children to thordak i have no knowledge of the other dragons which have attacked  this day  travis we should ask him  laura laughs we need to do as much research as we can  matt i have not seen thordak myself in 15 years and i know not 
none	 the state of which he is in or  what power he has now gained whatever information you can gather safely right now is going to  guide us down the rest of this path in attempting to take this terrible creature down  sam if we go back into the city to try to find council members and we succeed what does that  get us a bunch of people who also dont know how to defeat the dragon  laura right but theyre powerful people they could help us  sam politically  taliesin both actually  laura 
none	 experience and warriorwise  travis what about a spy dragons want servitude right  matt they especially the reds see themselves as superior to all beings and will bend and have  in the past bent small townships and civilizations to their whims and worship yes  which is based on what youre telling me is part of what thordak is attempting with this city now  travis so what if we send a shady piece of shit to go bend the knee and walk on the inside  sam listen jarett is good but i dont want to sacrifice 
none	 him like that  laura what about you scanlan youre so good at lying and  marisha being shady  laura and sucking up and grovelling  sam what about trinket  laura trinket cant talk  sam oh thats right  marisha thats not a bad idea  liam and i do have this pulling the brooch off this would mask your true nature somewhat  travis its true gasps  sam stuttering i am not going to go  travis ancient giant red fuckoff dragon  sam they have mind control powers they have influence they have charisma 
dung	 beyond even mine  travis youll be his bitch youll trim his toenails youll get real buddybuddy  sam im the size of his toenails  laura slave leia outfit with a chain around your neck  liam no hes the little guy next to jabba cackling laughter  marisha you might be surprised you might like it  travis yeah i mean like what dragons have to eat right dragons eat  laura dragons eat  travis yeah so you poison a cow and then youre like oh lord thioredoxin here you go  poison cow youre dead hero 
none	 of the city  sam something tells me i would end up his gimp  travis stuttering you dimension door youre super quick its a no brainer  sam all right thats the best plan ever  laura lets just think about it all right scanlan  liam we need to find uriel we need to go in all these are the next step we need to see we  have sacrificed a lot to save uriel before were not just going to leave him in the city we need to  find the tunnel under this keep go in 
none	 there see whos left and get them out  marisha you know speaking of spies does anyone else feel like this is fairly convenient timing  someone in that council had to have known this was happening wouldnt you all of the cloudtop  district was in one place  liam thats not a bad point  marisha someone knew it was the perfect opportunity to strike they took out the entire  upper echelon of the city in one strike they waited for them all to be in one place  laura general krieg was here for a while 
none	 before we discovered him he had friends  taliesin but he wouldnt have known this was coming though  laura no but he was one of them  liam its possible they might not have been working in conjunction with each other they could have been  on their own all of them or all together i dont know  taliesin it does open the door to some definite possibilities  marisha the timing was perfect thats all im saying  taliesin the timing was perfect  travis you know the best way to flush out something like that if 
none	 someone was a spy  laughter  sam all right ill do it ill go and  marisha what if we go and find a shady individual like he was saying what if we dont  send in scanlan what if we find someone  sam that person will surely die  laughter  marisha youre probably right  travis will surely die which im all right with  taliesin lets go find this tunnel that we paid for  laura we need to see get in the city and find some people allura you be safe  matt i 
none	 will  laura  and silent and swift and you get back here as quickly as possible  taliesin what time is it when was the last time we actually took a nap  matt oh its been quite a while you guys have been running since before the meeting in the  cloudtop district  marisha which happened at nighttime remember  matt it happened at dusk  laura its already morning the next day  matt no no its evening now for you guys  marisha what time approximately after midnight  matt id say its after midnight 
none	 1am  laura ah fudge  travis hot fudge  marisha i druidcraft a little tulip and hand it to allura  matt she takes it nods places it in one of the  marisha in case we need to be in contact  liam well if we go now we have the benefit of darkness in the city  sam hang on were going to go now without resting  liam im not saying that im weighing our options if we go now we can go under the cover  of night but were going to be exhausted  
none	 taliesin and dragons dont care about night they can see perfectly fine  marisha yes weve learned that much  liam well lets lie down and take a nap  laura take a nap  marisha what time wait hang on  laura sleep as little as possible that will actually get us rested  matt a short rest or a long rest  laura long rest  matt long rest is eight hours  laura should we sleep and get up in the morning and hit it  taliesin itll at least give everybody time to go to ground 
none	  laura thats true i mean can i sense thordak and figure out i mean is he just settling in  that one spot is there anything else around or is it just him in the center being a dick and no  other movement of other things  matt you took a while earlier to concentrate and you focus on that point again thordak is this  giant oppressive force of dragon kin in the center of the city seemingly not moving  liam and last week you said that vex couldnt sense the other three  matt correct 
none	  laura they went to hit the other cities obviously  marisha i still have one 5thlevel spell left i can commune with nature and try and find out if a  few people are still left in the city before we go to sleep  liam might as well  marisha if were not going out  laura what  marisha i can commune with nature and try to find certain people  laura should we yeah  marisha all right i go out to pike and the sarenrae temple  matt okay so as you go the temple 
none	 you can see the surviving 25 people that are all lumped in  theyre calmer right now but you can see a lot of them are still consoling each other and talking  and as soon as you walk in theyre like a couple of them step up immediately like whats going  on is everything all right im sorry mom im sorry they start crying and shh its okay  its okay is everything all right are we safe here is this okay  marisha you will be all right everyone calm down weve had a rough day and 
none	 its been hard on  everyone but you should be safe here for the evening hopefully everyone  travis do better  marisha look im not im trying on this whole leadership thing okay  matt make a persuasion check  marisha ugh  taliesin ouch i didnt know it went that low im sorry  marisha eight  matt surprisingly i rolled a one first roll of the night  marisha any little bit of hope works  matt yeah apparently so the one man who stood up and the younger child to him looks around and  he 
none	 tells her shh go lay down very well thank you again were sorry for everyone else in the  room nods in agreement and you see theyre dirt and tearstained and all just happy to not be on  fire right now or frozen  travis are there any injuries in the room that we havent attended to  matt there have been a few injuries however pike has already taken time with keyleth to see to  them when they first arrived  laura hey matt i was helping too mother  matt you were helping until you were 
none	 pulled away for the five minutes  travis good job pike and you too vex  ashley yeah you know got to help the group  matt all right so as you guys are having this conversation allura and drake walk their way out  to the courtyard and she looks back at the rest of you and goes stay safe and if anything happens  find a way to let me know i will return as soon as i can with what i can find possibly who i can find  laura wait  marisha secrets  travis dont 
none	 forget to visit gilmores glorious goods  sam thats not a real place travis it doesnt exist  travis whos travis i cant just hop in  and out of character  sam grog who are you talking to  travis my sword  marisha your sword youre promoting gilmores to your sword  matt so go ahead and roll for me  laura okay  travis what  laura whoa 24  matt okay all right so as you and allura embrace she steps back and gives a nod and looks  out to everybody  marisha i reach 
none	 out and i grab her hand and say thank you truly for everything  matt dont thank me yet most of all of this lies on my shoulders and you can see shes  holding it together the best she can but there is a crippling guilt in her visual presence based on  everything thats happening here you know that theres a mutual understanding that while no one  knows the true reason why all this is happening everyone seems to have a stake as to why it  happened and possibly may have been somewhat at fault and 
none	 as she nods she looks at drake and  drake gives her a nod and begins casting a spell as his fingers twirl in the air these blue sparks  trail his fingertips as it draws this large spiral of electrical energy that holds itself in place  it bursts out and encompasses both their bodies and their forms all of a sudden shrink down and  shutter into these two sparks of energy that then arc off and you can see these two bolts of  electricity now coasting through the sky bouncing off roads bouncing off rock bouncing 
none	 off a tree  they both are traveling via spark across the countryside  laura how the fuck do we get that ability  marisha i dont know but i want it  laura shes so fucking cool do you think that was her or do you think that was drake  matt drake cast it  laura oh man thats so cool  sam should we go to sleep  marisha well im doing my commune with nature spell i drop down and mediate  matt all righty  sam if only i had taken a dump in the 
town	 middle of town i could see whats going on right now  laughter  travis hindsight is ten  sam other number  laughter  matt okay three facts of your choice as you sit in the temple quietly and connect yourself with  the land and the foliage of the surrounding area of emon what are your questions  marisha do i sense gilmores presence  matt whats the radius on this three miles  marisha a few miles  matt you do sense a presence  marisha a presence  matt a very weak presence  laura gasp 
none	 oh no  sam that could mean hes far away or that hes dead  marisha can i focus in even harder and find where that presence is coming from more directly  matt the direction that best you can ascertain is its in the direction of abdars promenade  marisha his shop  matt thats where his shop is yes  sam good to know  marisha okay last question do i sense uriel  matt within your threemile range you do not  laura maybe he  travis he got to moving  sam or hes dead  
none	 laura okay when you are sensing things does that mean you would sense if they were alive or  you wouldnt sense them at all if they were dead  matt the questions were are they in the city which direction are they those are essentially  the answers that you get through the connection of nature  laura okay so they could be dead in the city and youd still sense them  matt thats possible  marisha i dont know its hard to say  liam he could have gone to the harbor he could have fled through 
none	 the tunnels we dont even know  about  laura he could have a teleportation circle  marisha we should check his shop first  travis yeah if uriels farther away its  marisha uriel i dont know  maybe hes dead maybe hes gone i dont know i dont know  travis yeah its a moo point  marisha how about this lets find gilmore if hes alive or dead then that will answer a lot of  questions hows that  liam i agree  taliesin yes  liam and if he did not make it we still 
none	 go to his shop  sam take everything  liam use whatevers left its what gilmore would want  sam its true  travis i agree  laura we go then if it hasnt been ransacked already  travis lets go find that magic fucker  marisha so were going now tonight  taliesin sleep and then go  marisha i dont know maybe we should go  laura should we stealth in and see what we can see i dont know i feel like we need to rest yall  marisha how bad are we  liam laughing i 
none	 should probably rest  ashley im at 25  travis oh shit  laura im pretty low and im almost out of dice  travis i can stay guard with the rest of everybody else because im okay  liam theyre expecting thordak is expecting to sit on us like a bunch of eggs in a basket were  fine for the night we go tomorrow  laura potentially  marisha okay  matt all right you guys take a long rest  taliesin quick question where is the skull  travis you fucking that was my question  laura 
none	 i dont know what are you talking about  matt who had the skull last  travis you expect me to remember those sort of things  marisha i remember  taliesin either you have it or i have it i dont remember  matt the last person to hold it was vex  taliesin was vex okay excellent i have a perfectly reasonable hiding place or if you like  you can take it  travis yeah your ass  laura yes i think its reasonably wellhidden at this moment  taliesin excellent  sam where is it  
none	 laura i dont know  marisha wellhidden  taliesin that will do  matt all right you guys find yourselves as best as you can resting for the evening it is an  evening of tossing and turning for a lot of you flashes of memories scanlan you are plagued by  the thought of your newly discovered daughter being not far outside the city when all this went  down percy you have flashes of the idea of whitestone recently saved and brought to freedom  being torn asunder by dragons not two weeks afterwards you are plagued by 
none	 visions of the  pyrah the moment that thordak must have torn through and the havoc that was wreaked afterward  both of you cant help but think back to when you first returned to byroden and seeing the smoldering ruin  that you now know to be the work of the cinder king 15 years before and those words about  wondering if that was the last thing your mother saw grog you want that skull  laughter  matt pike your thoughts go back to vasselheim and the people there that you out of necessity  and need 
none	 for friendship and to protect them left behind knowing that they would be safe and  now the uncertainty as to whether or not vasselheim still stands and whether or not you  left them to a fate you could have protected them that guilt rides on you as well you guys complete  your long rest you restore full hit points and you get back half of your max hit dice you can  only get back half so if you spent more than half of your hit dice youre still at just so you guys  are aware 
none	 of that  marisha wait what we only restore half each night  matt yes  taliesin not half of whats missing but  marisha just half  matt yeah so if you used eight of your hit dice you are only going to get back at level 12 six  hit dice  marisha good to know i dont think i used any  matt so it is a gradual declining resource hasnt come up too much beforehand but i want to  make sure you guys were aware of that anyway as you come to in the morning 
none	 you can smell youre  used to laina cooking a very nice breakfast you smell food being cooked but its much more basic  for the masses as you eventually groggily find your way downstairs pardon the pun you can see  there is essentially a gruel pot and there is a soup line and food is being served best to their  capabilities to the people that have taken refuge in greyskull keep you are welcome to do as you please  laura we should head out  taliesin im ready  sam were just going to march into 
none	 the city  laura were going to march under the city  travis yeah were going to check out that tunnel first  sam the tunnel just goes to the other side of the wall  liam we dont even know where the tunnel is we need to find an entrance to said tunnel  matt the tunnel actually  travis and then sorry i was going to say and then when we get to the the city then we figure  out what we do  sam grog good thinking laughs  travis leave it to me  matt 
tavern	 so the tunnel has been installed to the back of the kitchen there is a large pantry there  and the tunnel is a trap door that is currently set by the very very back of the pantry  actually not too dissimilar from the entrance to the clasp in the diamond nest inn however its  much smaller and is a small singleperson tunnel you have to go singlefile and its not very tall  grog you are going to have to almost crawl through at your height and everyone else would  have to hunch down except for 
none	 you and pike are fine you guys are tiny enough its about a  gnomesized tunnel  sam nice  matt and as you guys go into the pantry laina is like oh dont im trying wheres everyone going  and sees you all clowncar into the pantry  laura before we left i wanted to find jarett really fast  matt okay jarett is currently outside of the keep in the main courtyard area crossbow at the  ready keeping his eyes to the sky mostly looking off in the direction of emon  laura i walk up and 
none	 i hand him a bag of 300 gold and i say this is far and away so much more  than we asked you to do when we hired you and i appreciate everything youre doing take care of  the keep use this money to take care of the people here  matt he takes it and throws it in the air and catches it i appreciate that i take great pride  in my work and i assure you i would sooner die than let this place fall  laura then i give him additional 100 gold  
none	 sam what is going on  matt as you pass him the 100 gold he puts his hand up and actually pushes your hand away and  says i appreciate the sentiment but youve already done too much you hired me for a reason  im doing my job but your generosity is noted  sam ah hes so honorable  travis is his hair blowing in the wind as he rejects that amount  matt his hair is really short  laura i resist the urge to mug down with him and i walk away  matt okay  
none	 liam what are you waiting for  laughter  matt all right  travis yeah you might die he might die  liam yeah look at that big pouty bottom lip go get that  laughter  matt some of that marquet  laughter  marisha sexy sexy exotic accent  matt  and that ankharel caramel skin jaretts a hottie  liam i just saw 100 pictures drawn in a instant  laughter  taliesin with a flair  marisha wait you hear that its pens hitting the paper its fanfiction right now  matt so as you guys 
none	 make your way through the tunnel and its a long very simple tunnel the  construction is solid you dont feel as you walk through that any of it is in worry of collapse  there has been no sufficient seismic activity or impact above ground to warrant that directly above  the tunnel and you continue to trudge ahead and its pitch black those of you with darkvision  probably take the forefront  travis is there a light vision im on it  marisha i go ahead and light up a hand  matt so you guys all 
none	 of you have lowlight darkvision youre fine and percy is the only one  who needs the aid in this but as you continue forward for a good 25 30 minutes or so the  tunnel comes to a small stop and theres a very simple rope ladder that leads upward  laura i put my hood up  matt whos going up first  travis is there anything past that  matt the ladder goes up and goes into a small wooden slat its not even a door its almost  like a wood pallet  laura get up 
none	 there see what you see  travis you sneaky dick  liam okay at the bottom of the ladder because shes right behind me you know you never cease  to impress me  matt okay you go up roll a stealth check  liam 25  matt all right good to know so as you get up to the top you feel the wooden slats on top and  as you push theres not any weight to them they give way immediately and as you push it aside  you can see youre inside a small wooden structure it 
none	 is enclosed and a little bit of the  morning light is peeking through the space between the slats of wood looking about the general size  and height it appears to almost be an outhouse structure but there is no actual outhouse here  or at least where there once was has recently been converted to the exit of your tunnel  liam smells like jerky  laughter  taliesin right there with you  matt there is a door that leads out  liam okay i will crack it an inch and look through  matt okay there 
none	 is a chain on the outside of the door that keeps it shut with a big thick lock at  the bottom  liam is there enough room to get my hand through to the other side  matt id say yes with your experience and your lithe form you manage to just eke it through and  you can get your wrist past but anything beyond  liam im doublejointed matt  matt and with that double joint you get that close so yeah you can reach it  liam all right so i can feel a lock there 
none	  matt yeah  liam all right im going to onehand pick this lock  matt okay go ahead and roll this is a difficult maneuver even with your experience given that  you cant actually see the front of the lock youre having to literally feel your way through it  travis roll high you pointyeared bastard  laura natural 20  marisha its like unclasping a bra  taliesin how do you do that  liam thats 30  matt laughs 30 with a single moment you actually feeling with one thumb youre feeling  the vibration of 
none	 each tumbler on the inside of the lock and as each one progressively clicks you  eventually get to the fourth one before tink and it hangs open loosely within a matter of 40  seconds you wish other people would have seen that happen because that was pretty pretty cool  maneuver but you know at least  liam come on up it wasnt even locked  all aw  laughter  matt hes so modest oh no we lost ashley we lost an ashley  liam ive got it ive got it  marisha cleric down  matt 
none	 as you all climb back up  laura stealth stealth stealth everybody i cast pass without a trace  marisha oh shes going to call back she said we turned into robots she disconnected  matt okay gotcha  laura i cast pass without a trace on us  matt okay good so  laura wait wait hows trinket going to climb up this rope yall polymorph  marisha i do have polymorph  sam oh no  marisha we need to make him tinier anyway what do you want him to be  sam we should leave him  
none	 laura shut up  matt which for the record trinket going through this tunnel looks like the cleaner in  labyrinth it fills the entire tunnel hes like bear noises having to pull his way through  laura okay what if we polymorph him into a very small raccoon but hes got hands you know so he  can hold things  liam what about a wolverine or a badger  marisha i have a question  sam honey badger doesnt care  laura honey badger dont give a shit it just takes what it wants  marisha if i 
none	 polymorph trinket can i then use beast sense to be able to see through him would  that be able to work  matt what does beast sense do  marisha beast sense lets me see through the eyes of a beast  matt you can do that with trinket regardless  marisha but does it stack with polymorph and if he is like polymorphed into i mean i guess hes  still a beast  matt if beast sense is a concentration then no you will lose one to do the other  marisha all right  matt yeah 
none	 and beast sense is concentration  laura is polymorph a concentration  matt yes it is so one or the other  marisha its fine but if i turned him into a bird i can make him an aerial scout is what i  was thinking like the wargs in game of thrones  matt or you can become one yourself what are you doing  marisha i will make him a cute little sewer rat or like  laura no he can hang on to me  travis oh my god make him something  laura will he still 
none	 get his armor  marisha can i make him a lemur laughs  matt you can  laura but lemurs are slow dude raccoons are cool  marisha how about a red panda  laura red panda  marisha im going to make him a red panda  taliesin red panda thats cool  sam wait wait wait can a red panda climb a rope ladder any better than  matt as the rest of the party climbs their way up during vex and keyleths bickering over what  form trinket should take trinket if youve ever seen a bear 
none	 roll its eyes before this is the  moment as it fills the entire tunnel it goes bear noises with a killmenow expression  eventually you decide on a red panda  marisha yeah its a good breed  matt the mystical red panda from wildemount you extend your hand and trinkets form shrinks into  this small temporarily elevated red panda and falls to the ground  laura aww i love you hes so cute i pick him up and i tell him to hang on to me  matt he does and wraps around your neck like the 
none	 foxtail you already have there you guys climb up  and as you emerge you see now youre at the very very back of an alleyway that is buttressed  against the inside of the outer wall so youre inside the city youre in this small very very  welloutoftheway alleyway this back alley that ends at your outhouse as well as a secondary one  next to you that appears to be functional based on the smell and there is trash and junk back  here its definitely one of the forgotten corners of emon  taliesin you have 
none	 your map  sam yeah were right here wheres gilmores again  matt abdars promenade to the northeastern  laura stealth can we all stealth  sam thats up here wow we have to cross the entire city  marisha and weve got pass without a trace  sam but we could go along the wall  laura lets do it  sam all the way along the outside wall  marisha do we want to go through the city or along the outside of the city are we going to  take the long way or the direct path 
none	  liam the long way the slow way the careful way  sam take the beltway  liam stealthy  taliesin stealthy  matt all right everyone roll stealth please  laura you add ten because  sam we add ten  matt ashley stealth for you as well with disadvantage but you add ten still there  ashley  laura oh no  travis ashley  liam im hanging up on you i still love you but im going to hang up  matt all right so call back and you guys stealth checks  taliesin 39  marisha

town	 you can do that  liam ashley rolled a four she texted me  laura so 14  matt okay so you guys step out of this alleyway and the first thing that catches you is the  visual  laura chained back up the outhouse  matt okay so you chained it back and put the lock back on as you step back out into the center  of the first road you come across the crossroads to this alleyway you look up and can see there are  even through the night a good two dozen streams of 
town	 smoke billowing out from different parts of the  city where throughout the entire evening there has been buildings burning crumbling or fires of  indeterminate origin throughout the city that are still spreading theres the perpetual smell of  smoke and dust in the air and you can see every now and then the wind will blow a bit and a  little bit of ash will be thrown up in the air and come to rest much of what you see around you is  intact the buildings directly around you on this side everything seems intact though 
none	 theres very  little signs of life on this immediate corner it looks like either everyone is inside or this part  of the city has been abandoned or people are keeping out of the streets at this point so what  do you guys want to do  laura go along the wall to the other side to get to gilmores  matt okay  laura sneaky  matt all right you guys coast along the wall to the very southward side trudging up across the  main gate which as you can see now theres normally a very 
none	 heavy guard presence on the south  gate to emon the gate is currently partially opened and you can see a bunch of the guards as  well as a number of individuals in the city currently frozen in place in the midst of a sudden  bit of chaos you can see the guards with shields and pikes at the ready screaming and looking up  into the sky their final moment trapped now in that frozen horrifying visage you see people  running trying to make their way out of the gate and couldnt quite get past in 
none	 time and the  gate itself has a large sheet of ice that is frozen against it thats slowly thawing you can  see the ground around them is turning muddy with all the moisture thats slowly melting away as the  day progresses  laura and theyre like the people in our keep theyre past the point of healing  matt you can certainly check and inquire  liam theyve been here for eight hours at least theyre gone  travis yeah leave it  laura i want to see if cure wounds is im going to just try 
dung	  marisha i assist  matt okay so you go up and reach out and cast cure wounds on one of the frozen bodies and your  hands touch it and you can feel the ice because its still very cold to the touch though its  damp and the moisture is gathering and dripping down off certain elbows and portions of the body  that are the lowest you complete the spell and feel the warmth of the cure spell extend past your  fingers with no sign of reaction or life within the body this poor woman apron 
none	 on looking over  her shoulder running holding what little belongings she had is there her final moment  captured as she stares off in the direction of where you assume vorugal swooped towards the south  gate before making their way towards greyskull keep the night before  travis lets go before were discovered quickly  marisha okay  matt as you guys tread across the main thoroughfare and its the one point where you are  inescapably out in the open and as youre taking a moment touching the corpse of this woman frozen  in place vex 
town	 you catch out the corner of your eye what appears to be a figure stepping towards  you in the center of the street  sam wait you see someone  matt as you notify the rest of the group you guys look over and you can see now stepping from  one of the alleyways there is a humanoid figure walking through the road cloak draped behind in  the back hood up wide shoulders and is not seemingly making any attempt to be unseen or really  hiding their presence this is someone who is beelining for your 
none	 group in this moment  marisha hes heading towards us  matt yes  marisha yeah does he see us  matt heading right towards you  laura i take out a arrow and say stop  marisha i do flame hands  matt okay the figure stops for a moment and pulls the hood back and you can see now  revealed a looking humanoid but the features are more intense and thick a very square jaw the  skin has a slight grayishgreen tint to it what looks like one tooth underneath and this is a  halforc 
none	 individual wearing a black cloak and very simple studded leather armor if our guest would  like to step on to the stage  all ooh  liam yeah mixing it up  matt so just to let you guys know we have a guest joining us this evening the illustrious and  talented jason charles miller who is an  sam where is he going  matt between you guys right there yeah there you go  marisha come squeeze  matt jason is going to join us for this evening of gameplay  jason my first action will 
none	 require me to get up so  matt okay well get low for a moment so i can introduce you so you can say hey this is jason  jason is a voice actor actually the voice of drizzt dourden right now if you know who  marisha oh shut the fuck up i didnt know that  matt yeah so thats pretty awesome as well as the writer of our theme song our critical role  theme song which we are working on a new intro right now and in the near future we will have that for  
none	 you guys  marisha you can download it on itunes  matt yes you can we will have that coming out soon but yes so jason thanks for joining us  tonight  jason sure thanks for having me  marisha hi jason  matt well give you the full whole at end the show but nonetheless the halforc approaches  lowers his hood  jason okay so i actually start speaking in thieves cant to vex here so ive got to whisper  something  matt okay go for it so as the orc lowers his hood he begins 
none	 to  marisha why dont you make him come over here  laura who are you talking about  jason vax sorry the the person that can speak thieves cant  laura i can speak thieves cant too  jason but im talking to him  taliesin thieves cant speak ooh  matt and whispers to the two of them  marisha these are tiny tables  matt so suddenly the orc begins to utter a series of strange sounds like double talk and gibberish  laura im reading his damn lips as hes doing it  matt all right 
none	 and you knowing thieves cant pick up the details so you can let her know as  well the rest of you see this orc speaking nonsense and a very brief reaction from the twins  marisha look hes been under a lot of stress all right  liam hes trying to get us to join scientology thats all  laughter  marisha our thetan levels are off the charts right now  taliesin my thetan levels at 16 right now  laura youre a member of the clasp then  jason yes  marisha oh  jason youre the 
none	 first faces i recognize ive been hiding here since the attack  marisha you recognized us why how  jason im a member of the clasp  liam did you all make it  marisha we were there recently  liam whats left  jason i dont know i was on a mission up above ground when the attack happened im trying  desperately to get back to see who is left my name is garthok  sam garthok  jason yes  sam we are vox machina i am the de facto leader my name is scanlan shorthalt  
town	 jason i know who you are and you are the first people ive made myself visible to youre the first  people that i recognize or even know that i can trust  marisha have you been through the city how much is left  jason it is not its indescribable there is incredible destruction  marisha have you encountered any more survivors  matt which you have as you walked through the city you have noticed there are many survivors of  the town a lot of them have kept inside but there are a number that are actually 
town	 running  through and looting the town  laura ugh  liam what was your name again  jason garthok  liam garthok what of the spirelings what of the leaders of the clasp  jason all i know is what i knew before the attack  liam weve come here looking for survivors we dont intend to stay long you are welcome to come  with us  laura are you one of the people looting you said you saw other people doing the same  jason im not a looter i was on a classified mission above ground 
town	 and now thats all gone to  shit basically so im trying to get back to our headquarters  sam garthok are you familiar with tunnels or secret passageways around the city at all  jason you could say yes absolutely  sam are we near any  laura we need to get across town and not be seen  marisha we are trying to get to the abdars promenade  liam wait show me your brand  matt he reveals the back of the cloak and you do indeed see the brand of the clasp the same one  
none	 you carry between the shoulder blades  marisha do you know each other  laughter  liam its a pretty big organization  matt there are certain tunnels that traverse underneath emon specifically amongst the clasp  however two of the locations to the south of the city one in the graveyard district and one in the  temple district which you guys are adjacent to right now those are the two that immediately come  to mind the temple one that you are nearby seeking has been completely demolished and is  unusable theres one to the graveyard district 
none	 theres one north of abdars promenade that could  possibly be of use to you those are the only ones that come to mind that are nearby  taliesin well if were heading that way anyway we stop by gilmores and we do need to check in  with the clasp anyway  liam maybe  taliesin theyre going to be helpful  liam maybe  travis are we out in the open right now  matt you are out in the open right now  travis can we fucking get inside please  liam we need to get to 
none	 gilmores glorious goods do you know where that is  jason yes i can lead you there  liam underground  jason i could if the temple entrance wasnt destroyed  marisha i might be able to clear it out  travis you want to walk towards the temple  sam were near the temple district now  marisha we can take the tunnels under  sam but if the entrance to the tunnel was destroyed its best not to risk it lets keep going  laura and well make a lot of noise clearing it out  taliesin thats 
none	 true  laura best to skirt  liam building to building  sam are you okay with stealth  marisha i might be able to tunnel us to the closest tunnel system from right here  laura do it then  matt how do you intend to do this  marisha move earth sixth level  laura whoa youre using a 6thlevel spell right now  marisha do we want to do it now  sam were not near the entrance to the tunnel right now  laura no lets just stealth it yeah save that  taliesin we can 
none	 save that for an emergency  marisha ill save it  matt okay it will take you at the rate at which it moves earth it will take you probably a good  hour to two hours to  marisha to get to the tunnels  matt to get to any sort of system that he may be referring to  marisha all right lets just walk well walk faster  matt all right so garthok im going to have you roll a stealth check to move alongside the  rest of the group  jason great 25  marisha 
none	 does he benefit from pass without a trace  matt no he arrived after the spell was cast but as you guys move forward he also dives into the  shadows in a very similar way that youve seen vax do before this orc definitely understands the  resources of light and the absence of it  taliesin hes played some assassins creed  matt laughs hes hitting you all up in the shoulders for change all right so  liam is that a dice game  taliesin its a band theyre very good  matt so as you guys 
town	 push forward staying towards the outskirts of the city you do come  across on the outer area of the temple district a humble neighborhood that has been completely  reduced to cinders and ash there is probably a good eight to ten buildings that are piles of  black still burning wood dust and broken stone you can see on the outskirts of some of these  piles of rubble bodies lying in the street the skin charred black and cracked as the face and  arms are curled up in the final moments of agony you avert your 
town	 gaze and continue pressing  onward and you can see now many of these large temples in the center of the city you can see  folks gathered to them and clustered on the inside you can hear people shouting and folks  trying to deal with this current circumstance befalling the town you continue to move out of  the sight of those clusters of survivors that are going to their various deities for aid and  comfort you push further towards the center of the temple district you do catch out of the left  the sound of 
none	 breaking glass specifically to you vex in the distance as you glance over and look  you can see four individuals climb out of a window with sacks over their shoulders they all gesture  to each other and go running off northward deeper into the city carrying whatever goods they  managed to acquire from the interior and as you progress you do notice a lot of windows have been  broken you dont know if from the inside or outside some may have been from the impact of the  attack some may have been from individuals that 
none	 have been moving from building to building its  hard to say at this point theres such disarray around you as you skirt along the very far end of  the temple district you see a portion of the neighborhood now is in itself encased in ice like  the individuals you saw at the south gate this is another area where vorugal made its way through  and you can see another array of icy coffins of other individuals who were trying to escape but  were locked in place you can see a small group of living emon 
none	 residents that are currently gathering  the dead and trying to take them out of the open and possibly give them a proper burial whether it be  people they know or not but there is a look on each of their faces of desolate acceptance of what  is happening and trying to process this  travis can i slink back to vax and i say you still think that what was inside that skull is worse  than all of this  liam i think it is probably equal to this weve been burned before grog this was 
town	 going to happen  whether we wanted it to or not  travis yeah but we could have done something about it i walk on  matt okay  liam big if big man  matt the clouds are beginning to gather up over the sky as you continue forward and the little bit  of sunshine that came through this morning is now covered in coming rain clouds which may be a boon  to those buildings that still burn and possibly an annoyance to a giant firebased red dragon in the  center of the city but nevertheless 
none	 the weather is quickly shifting as you begin pushing into abdars  promenade you can see the central bazaar before you the memory of it this sprawling landscape of  multicolored tents and carts and what was this bustling marketplace is all closed down and a  portion of it appears to have been torn through you can see broken bits of wood and wagon wheels  tossed asunder like apparently one of these dragons may have smashed into the center and let  loose its fury you can see spatters of blood across elements of the ground but no 
none	 sign of a  body as there are a few groups going around trying to gather what they can but the place is  also picked clean you notice a lot of these tents and carts are empty of any real valuables you are  uncertain whether or not the proprietors took it themselves or they have been picked clean by looters  laura scavengers  matt you begin to approach with a very very nervous heart the corner of the bazaar that leads  to gilmores place as you approach the nervousness is met with the visual of a 
town	 large  stack of black smoke that rises from that direction as you push through with increased  haste towards that area of the bazaar you see gilmores glorious goods as well as two other  adjacent buildings completely destroyed piles of rubble and what looks to be a group of about ten  individuals that are currently picking through the rubble and gathering what they can moving over  wood and brick  liam i stop stealthing and walk right into it and start shouting shouting get the fuck out of  here get out  matt as you 
none	 do that all of them turn over looks and one says hey get your own shit all right  liam move on now now now  matt he stops and looks about the other one the other guys looking over their shoulders and  look were all just trying to stay alive here okay  taliesin i pull out my gun you heard the man  travis yeah big sword comes out too  marisha fire hands  laura dont test us  marisha weve had a really shitty day  matt youve had a shitty day  marisha weve 
none	 all had a shitty day  matt well lets make it all sorts more shitty and he pulls a shortsword from his side and all  the rest of them pull their blades out and they say look we saw this first were going to  bring it to him and save ourselves  liam ill fucking gut you like a fish  laura stop  liam and take your innards  laura stop  liam  out your mouth i will not  laura stop you will take it to him  marisha whos him  laura thordak  
town	 matt they all with their weapons out tense their shoulders and say theres only one way we  are going to survive this  laura listen theres so much more available to you buildings up that way not worth your time  right here  matt laughs honey weve already picked plenty clean from this pile this is our third time back  travis itll be your last time back if youre not careful  laura is it worth your death bringing this to him is it worth your death because you will die here  matt you know what 
none	 i think i stand a better chance against the lot of you than with that thing  marisha you just thought wrong  laura step on and go find loot somewhere else at least then you can present it to him and not die  here dont be stupid  matt make a persuasion check  travis vex please let me off the chain  laura ugh i rolled so poorly anybody want to assist me  matt its a little late for that  laura sings how about ten  matt okay you can see as hes holding his 
town	 shortsword to the side goes you know you may  be stupid but there are other stupid things in this town like walking in the middle of an  ambush dear  at which point a dagger comes past  laura ive got passive perception  matt i know  laura motherfuck  matt you instinctually move your head out the way as it whoosh past you as you see another  individual that was keeping low to the rubble flung a dagger at you and the rest of them pull  their weapons ready and are about to enter 
none	 a fray i need everyone to roll initiative  marisha fuck these assholes  taliesin this is everything i wanted  laura natural fucking 20  marisha therapeutic asskicking thats pretty good  sam they may win  marisha nah fuck that were way more pissed off  sam they work for a dragon  laura do they theyre just looters  taliesin this is going to feel really good  marisha yeah  sam but theyre innocent  marisha yeah were not going to kill them well just beat their faces in  laura garthok did you lead us

none	 to it youre up what are you doing  laura okay im going to cast hunters mark on that motherfucker in front of me and then im  going to cast conjure barrage at all of them in front of me like a big cone effect  matt okay okay so conjure barrage is your action so thats your full thing so at which  direction are you doing it  laura just towards all the guys in front of me i want to get as many in the cone as i can  matt okay you probably need to

none	 its fine  matt all right cool all right so as you release this spraying torrent of arrows down the  way it fires outward all of them all of a sudden have to put their arms up to instinctually defend  themselves with arrows piercing bits of their armor and ricochet off its not horribly  damaging but enough to sweep into all of them and they all immediately look up angrily at each other  weapons at the ready to go ahead and get vengeance  laura i take the rest of my moment to back up against 
none	 a wall  matt okay right there all righty percy youre up next  taliesin all right im going to hex the one that she hunters marked  matt oh man  laura fuck that guy  matt all righty  marisha laughs fuck that one guy in particular  taliesin and im going to where am i oh there i am im going to run towards that other wall to  the left  matt this way  taliesin yep all the while taking a few shots at that bastard who i just hexed  matt as you are

none	 smoke that blasts off each impact until it leaves a hole off  this shoulder this actually blows this arm off from the impact and the third one just destroys  the upper part of his head and he slinks back onto the rubble  taliesin i move my hex to the next guy and point at him as im running  laura i move my hunters mark to the next guy because the other one went to zero  travis thats some hateful eight shit right there  matt laughs all right you have to use a bonus action

none	  you heavy breathing brings up a shortsword and is about to go in for the pierce at which point  you kick her away from you about a foot and draw the blade around and this time you run the blade  right into her torso piercing her through as she looks up at you you can see her skin go pale as  her strength is drawn into the blade you get to add a point to your strength  laura what how long does that last  matt that lasts until your next short rest  laura 
none	 dont rest ever  laughter  matt so yeah your strengths now 18 so add plus one to your attack damage going forward  travis plus one to damage  matt yeah to hit and damage with your attacks but you pull the blade out and she crumples to the ground  laura so for every person you hit it makes it better and better and better  travis can i look over my shoulder to the guy on the left and like youre next  matt you very much can you can see the visual of this presentation seems

none	 me they look down at this tiny armored gnome that knocked half their life  out of their body with a bit of confusion worry and respect in a weird way well done gnome  ashley yeah  matt okay does that end your turn  ashley can i try to intimidate him to tell him to drop his bow  matt uh as a bonus action ill let you do that sure  ashley all right drop your bow  laughter  matt all right go ahead and roll an intimidate check  ashley which i dont think i

none	 unsuspecting thugs  laura thats 14  matt 14 hits  laura and then 2d4 plus seven  matt correct you get two attacks with trinket by the way  laura oh sweet  matt because trinket attacks twice when he does bestial  laura thats 11 on the first  matt 11 damage  laura and 13 on the second  matt okay so trinket runs forward and one claw tears the face off jaw unhinged the friend at  the side looks horrified as trinket then bears down with the secondary claw and takes the  remainder of 
none	 the head off the shoulders  laura very nice very nice  sam go trinket  matt power in those claws all right that ends your turn  laura yeah  matt percy youre up  taliesin is that crossbow asshole still standing  matt the crossbow  taliesin the guy who just laughed at our little gnome  matt yeah  taliesin okay ive just noticed that my guy was going to hit me and then started acting weird so  taking a second to look around im going to see that little laugh with the crossbow coming up

none	 unfortunately  taliesin all right im taking another  matt oh theres the guiding bolt right its all right yeah missed the guiding bolt so you  have advantage on that attack im pretty sure  taliesin oh so im going to roll it again  liam thank you pike  ashley youre welcome  marisha same fucking roll  taliesin i dont know what happened okay ten so that  matt so that one fires and now youre out of bullets  taliesin i know so now im going to reload and fire again  matt okay so your

dung	 sees you  about to take the shot and concentrates for a moment and the front of your barrel begins to glow  with divine light as you fire the bullet itself actually is whitehot as it leaves the barrel  taliesin this is such a confused gun  matt i know  taliesin okay thats not bad thats 20 plus five necrotic  matt okay the impact of the divine enchanted bullet hits the current darkenergyhexed  individual and in the blast of light versus dark the upper torso of the thug is incinerated it is  ash the 
none	 waist below visible as it slumps over no longer visible  marisha that was awesome  taliesin and im going to start walking my way towards keyleths special friend yeah about there  matt there okay  taliesin im not running im walking  matt all right its now their turn the dwarf now moves over goes of course and begins  taking all of its weapons and throws its mace down and puts its crossbow at your feet spends its  entire turn emptying its pouch and handing you what gold and gems and things it gathered  laura 
none	 this is the best thing ever  matt and giving you everything with a big dwarvish smile underneath its crusty beard  sam thank you youre doing a good service  taliesin make him shave  laura that is mean  taliesin i know  matt this ones going to attack keyleth so the one attacking keyleth this is the one attacking  you keyleth  marisha oh yeah  matt it saw you transform into minxie thats going to be whats your ac  marisha as a tiger or no i keep my ac right or no i take 
none	 the tigers ac  matt it should be in your ability your wild shape ability im pretty sure you take it as the  creature  marisha then 11  matt 11 that hits just making sure thats the case right now real fast as we go over to this point  marisha i know i keep all of my brain stats but i lose all my physical stats  matt correct yeah you gain the ac of the creature as well  marisha okay so 11  matt all right so  marisha oh no wait wait wait wait 
none	 12  matt 12 is the ac first one misses second one hits  marisha oh cool okay cool  matt it rolled 11 on the first attack so you do take 11 points of bludgeoning damage as the mace  swings out and smacks into the side of your shoulder you feel the impact but its nothing  too harsh there are two of them now that are trying to go against grog being the angry one  that just bisected their ally they have advantage on you because they are both pack tactics the  first attack is 
none	 a 23  travis that hits  matt second one is a natural 20 third attack with advantage is 15  travis misses  matt misses and the fourth and final one is a 17  travis misses  matt so a hit and a natural 20 okay so that is nine reduced to five against you and then 12  reduced to six so you take 11 points of bludgeoning damage between the two of them trying  to beat on this furious angry goliath individual and then theres one over here thats attacking  trinket now thats right 
none	 in front  laura he just saw trinket rip somebody elses face off  matt yeah and in doing so swings out with a 13 im pretty sure misses trinkets ac  laura oh yeah it does hes got a better armor class than me  matt he swings out shaken by what it just saw happen to its friend and then takes that anger and  turns around rolling a 23 which im pretty sure hits the mace slams into the side of trinkets  armor with a resounding loud impact the actual echo of the metal impact audible 
none	 in the immediate  vicinity dealing a total of seven points of bludgeoning damage to trinket  laura hes resistant to bludgeoning damage because of his armor  matt yep so that would make it four all right that ends their turn keyleth youre up  marisha okay really pissed off at this guy still im going to concentrate and bring down a  bolt of lightning in front of him or behind  matt right there  marisha yeah  sam dragons can see bolts of lightning  marisha its also a cloudy day  sam all right all 
none	 right that makes sense  matt second bolt of lightning strikes the ground behind the guy in front of you he rolled a 20 so  he did make his save im pretty sure against you roll 4d10 he takes halfdamage  marisha so okay six ten 21 points so ten  matt ten points of damage  marisha and then im going to do an attack on him grr  matt uh you have to use your action to pull the bolt down though  marisha i thought it was bonus  matt it should say on the spell 
none	 ill doublecheck  marisha i thought you could do that with call lightning  matt call lightning uh on each of your turns you can use your action to call it down so yeah  a bolt is what you got  marisha okay thats fine  matt okay however the individual now is twice hit by lightning and is looking extremely rough  and barely standing on his two feet is that your turn  marisha i cant do anything else can i  matt okay garthok youre up  jason garthok attacks the one attacking trinket  matt 
none	 okay  jason and i can sneak attack right  matt yeah hes currently distracted between you and trinket  sam what are you going to do what are you going to do  matt roll to hit first  jason oh yeah i was so excited  sam what if you miss  laura he wont miss  jason 13  matt 13 does hit  cheering  travis skewer that piece of shit  marisha nice thats hot  travis let the dice hit the floor  jason 20  matt 20 points all right so you take 
none	 the spear and jam it into the abdomen of this looter here  who the sheer force of it from the strength as your muscles push in lifts him and slams him  against the wall youve partially pinned him against the stonework there he reaches over and  slams down on your hand repeatedly until eventually you withdraw and leave him back on his  feet hes looking rough but hes definitely still holding his own is that  jason can i use my cunning action with my hand crossbow or  matt well you can use a bonus 
none	 action to fire with your hand crossbow at him if you want to  jason yeah  matt all right its at disadvantage because you are in melee with him so go ahead and roll twice  and take the lower of the two  laura this will be sick though if he hit it  sam those are stinky dice  jason 11 11  matt 11 just hits  cheering  matt thats his ac all right so go ahead and roll damage with the hand crossbow 1d6 plus  whatever  laura right in the face  
none	 jason six  matt six points of damage as you pull the spear out you reach to your side and overthearm pull  the hand crossbow out and fire it goes right into his left eye socket  cheering  matt with that you set the spear to the side and lock in the next bolt for your hand crossbow are  you staying there  jason yeah  matt all right that ends your turn grog youre up  travis the poor bastard thats closest to you to my upper right yeah that little fucks going to  get

none	  weapons to the ground as the other remaining thug looks around and sees the mess that youve made of  all of his various compadres and immediately drops to the ground hand over his head going  im sorry im sorry im sorry  laura we shouldnt have taken him hostage i wanted to just kill him  travis oh dont worry  jason we can still kill him  sam and as my bonus action i tell the dwarf to start collecting all the stuff from all the other  people as well  matt certainly right away 
dung	 see if he makes his save he does not so he then walks over and  starts looting the corpses of his friends for you laughs  taliesin thats dark thats dark  matt all right so theres the one guy whos on the ground now hands over his head  travis is he the only one left  matt hes the only one left  laura and the dwarf who is looting things now  marisha i stay in minxie form and stay on him growling at him  matt okay  laura i actually you know what instead 
none	 of looting im going to  matt slowly the rain begins to hit as the storm finally starts coming down elevated by the druid  spells that brought the moisture to gather over this section you walk over to him  laura im actually going to start using perception to look for any sign of gilmore in the  rubble or  sam gilmore use your dragon perception lady  matt this would be more of an investigation check as you begin to pore over the rubble  yourself to gather it  laura okay i leave him to you 
none	 all  travis wheres the meat  liam it was my turn in initiative so i want to walk over to him  matt okay  laura natural 20 on investigation  marisha oh thats going to be good thats good  matt all righty so you walk over so as shes investigating it you go ahead and you walk over  to him  liam youre coming with me i lift him up and im leading him off around the corner of a building  marisha i pace along as minxie  matt okay garthok you doing anything

none	 a pile there in the alley  liam pick up some shit from the ground and prop it up against him a couple of pieces not bury  him just hide him a bit  matt okay  liam and then i walk back to the group and i start picking shit up around where my  sister is  marisha i go back i guess i was useful  jason i thought we were going to interrogate him  marisha me too laughs i came along as intimidation  liam looters  marisha but he was bringing stuff back 
none	 and forth to  laura well hes still there and we do have a dwarf thats mindcontrolled right now that is  probably the best  matt who is currently looting the bodies  laura dont touch anything im investigating  matt as you are going through the rubble you can see a lot of the rubble has been moved over and  you see remnants of shattered glass cases and shelves and a lot of the things that you had  previously seen within gilmores glorious goods largely picked over and left behind many books  lie tattered and 
none	 burned and destroyed as part of the attack you get the sense here that most  anything that was of use or worth has been taken already and what the people here were gathering  they mentioned this was their third time back they were basically picking up what remnants they  could which were pieces of broken objects elements of gold that were left behind but most  of the contents of the store have been ransacked and taken  sam can i specifically look for the beaded curtain he emerges from  matt yes actually and as you 
none	 guys go toward the beaded curtain its torn apart and under a big  piece of rock you push aside and with the help of grog and a few other individuals you guys move  some of the rocks out of the way to where the bedroom is and its completely destroyed theres  no sign of gilmore or anybody else here and as the rains starting to come down a little heavier  you all get that sense of horror washing over you vex you notice looking underneath where the  shattered remains of the foot of his bed 
none	 are there is a smooth piece of stone with a handle  sam and a barrel of lube  laura i rush over to it  matt okay  laura can i detect traps now  matt i mean you could technically detect traps whenever you wanted to try  laura oh  matt you have to have sight for it if you want to go ahead and make a perception check  laura 26  matt 26 you take a moment to inspect it you follow the edge and yes it is indeed a false  door made of 
none	 this stone tile that comprises the floor of the room and it is a hatch it is not trapped  laura i start pushing on the bed and call for grog and say help me with this  travis what oh run over i help  laura theres a door  liam i hear her yelling and wander up as well  matt okay  marisha still in minxie pace over  matt the dwarf comes running up with you guys as well still  laura did he get everything i mean did he loot everything are we  matt 
none	 he comes up with all the various coin purses which interestingly enough are mostly empty  other than a few copper it seems like whatever theyve stolen is not on them currently  sam they gave it to the dragon  laura assholes  travis they gave it to him  laura the dragon  sam him whatever that is  travis did we ask  sam no  liam youve got a happy dwarf standing  sam oi dwarf  matt aye  sam who have you been collecting swag for  matt the dragon  sam okay

town	  matt and he explains about a 15minute walk from here there is a well that is in between four  buildings in an alley crosssection all of its been actually put into the well which has been  hollowed out or all the waters been repressed with dirt and its been filled with everything  theyve gathered  laura hes going to save eventually hes going to break your mind control maybe we should knock  him out right now  travis knock him out or  matt at which point he turns around going ugh  laura knock 
none	 him out  matt you know what go ahead and roll an attack its going to be surprise because he currently is  not aware of the situation so its autocrit  liam oh advantage all right well thats better 22  matt yeah that hits go ahead and roll  liam okay yeah okay okay thats a 13 16 thats still spinning counting 26 26 total  matt did you double that from the surprise because he wasnt even prepared  liam no so uh okay so  matt its enough if you double it as long as youre

town	 a moment to go ahead and  taliesin bow tie him in a little bow  matt little bow little dwarven bow okay you find a large piece of broken stone that was part  of the buildings base floor structure and you tie it around in multiple ways where hes going to  have a hard time getting out especially in his current mindspace when he comes to consciousness  the rains still pouring down hes soaked  laura now  matt all right you guys gather around the hidden hatch in the floor of gilmores room and were 
none	  going to go ahead and take a quick bathroom break  all oh  matt laughs a quick one well take a few minutes get right back into this because we do  have critmas tonight we want to make sure we get as much done before we have to leave so lets do  this see you guys in a minute  break  matt welcome back everyone so as liam here brings up our wondrous pike well go ahead and  hop back into the game in just a minute but i did want to say two

dung	 been a really awesome supporter of the show go check her out give her a follow if you have  the opportunity thank you very much by the way for helping support us so yay all right so  getting back in here as the rain now continues to pour down from above the open clouded sky of  emon you reach down and pull open the false latch on top of this open hidden compartment beneath  the remnants of gilmores room you look down into a dark lowlit interior and what appears to be a  figure who 
none	 rushes up very very quickly and stops and you hear a voice from within the darkness  just out of view from your position that says whoever you are leave run away or i swear ill  kill you  marisha sherri  laura sherri  matt you look down and it doesnt appear to be sherri its a woman frazzled hair you cant  make out the details of her expression but shes holding this blade in front  laura dont attack  sam sherri its us  laura did you work here were looking for gilmore  matt 
none	 looks past her shoulder sherri  matt and you see sherri now approaches her hair frazzled she looks like shes covered in soot  and actually has suffered some minor burns on part of her arm and the side of her face a little bit  and she steps into the little bit of light at the bottom of the shaft and looks up and goes my  god come in quick please and she ushers you down into this area  marisha i drop minxie form  matt okay as you guys all head down inside this is a 
none	 relatively small chamber maybe 20 feet by 20  feet theres a couple of small chairs and there are a few metal rods that are bolted into the  stonework leading down as a ladder that you can climb down this is obviously a hidden compartment  that gilmore uses to go up and down you get a better view now it is sherri there trinket  unfortunately at this moment cannot make his way down into this so looks at you bear grunts  looks around  laura stay and guard the unconscious fucks  matt bear grunts and 
none	 sets into a defensive position now looking out at the rest  laura if they start to wake up sit on them or kill them if necessary  matt gives a nod and stands there in the pouring rain soaking through trinket the armor  tingtingtingtingting tinging off the armor staying there keeping guard as you all climb  down you notice next to sherri a very frazzled and harrowedlooking the woman who was holding  the dagger in front her clothing is very very nice though currently torn and filthy this is  empress salda taldorei  travis oh 
none	 shit  sam wait what who  matt empress salda taldorei the wife of uriel  laura empress is uriel down here did you make it out the children  matt she puts her blade away she looks over her shoulder the children she puts her hand to  the side and you can see in the back room which now you can see there is a teleportation circle  that is slowly lit on the bottom of the floor within this room  marisha what was her first name again empress what  matt salda  marisha esalda with 
none	 an e  matt salda salda she looks over and you can see her three kids odessa illya and gren two  daughters and son are all sitting in the corner talking to each other they look like how children  deal in these type of situations theyre talking and playing games and trying to distract  themselves but as soon as you guys all walk in they look over quietly and their faces brighten  up at the arrival of somebody new and they recognize you as you begin to step into the low  light of the chamber 
dung	 salda then puts her hand down and says i dont believe my husband made  it but were alive  liam did you see him fall  matt no and she looks over into the far corner you can see amongst the pile of rags and  stuff there is one long pile of dark crushed velvet blue in the corner with a small puddle of  crimson under it he saved us and glancing over in the corner you can now see the shape of  gilmore slumped in the corner arm draped over his midsection head down to 
none	 the side in the  center of that pool  liam i run over i run over is he awake is he alive ive got my hand under his chin is he alive  matt you reach over and touch gilmores face and it is cold with sweat but its feverish sweat  there is a very very strong fever in his body and theres beads of sweat down the face and as  you look down you can see where the arm is holding there is blood soaked into the robe you can see  parts of the robe 
none	 right now are currently elements of it are burned and charred you can see  parts of it scraped away gilmores looking pretty rough  liam i pull him in pike pike pike keyleth come over here  matt pike what are you doing  ashley okay im going to cure wounds  liam its going to be all right pike is here its going to be all right its going to be all  right gil is there any consciousness  marisha i mean i can try and assist you pike with cure wounds thats all i have right 
none	 now  ashley okay yeah is he conscious  matt no unconscious unconscious and looking  marisha fading fast  laura can you like greater restoration i mean whats the best cure you can do pike  ashley okay okay okay  matt you guys can both make medicine checks to try and put him in a position where he would be  more susceptible to healing  laura 22  ashley i can use a sixth level and heal  matt use the spell heal  ashley yeah  marisha and i did a 16 on my medicine check 
none	 with her 22  matt okay so you guys take a moment you dress the wounds best you can and put him in a position  where pike as you bring forward you grab your holy symbol and clutching it between both your  hands very tightly you kneel down in front of the slowly fading body of gilmore you can see the  shiver occasionally instinctually in his unconsciousness and you reach out and touch him  and as you do the warm light of sarenrae fills your torso travels through your arms and into  the body of 
none	 gilmore his arms fall to his side limp as the warmth swells up into the torso and  for a second as the outside of the robe that you saw torn open opens up you can see now the  hideous gash that has currently torn through his abdomen as the warmth spreads through the body  and the light visually shows the horrible jagged nature of this wound the wound stitches itself up  and you can see it close leaving but the tiniest of scar across the blood itself all still caked  into the material but the 
none	 wound is now closed as you pull your hands back you can see gilmores  body which has from the sheer power of the heal spell has actually been elevated a few inches off  the ground and then clatters to the ground as the spell finishes and you can see he shivers for a  second he curls over pained grunt  liam i pull him into my lap and hold onto him  matt at this point sherri instinctively goes is he all right is he all right she pulls out  her glasses puts them on  
none	 liam i think so i think so  matt whos this one what is he doing here  sam hes a friend he fought with us hes not corrupted by the dragons influence  matt id like to know your name orcish sir  sam its really cool  jason im garthok i bow i bow  matt she gives you a sideways glance keep your distance i dont trust you yet  and she turns back around towards gilmore as youre holding him there the children at this  point are very quiet and sitting at his foot as 
none	 you all gather around this corner a minute passes  in silence another minute passes  liam smoothing his hair out hey hey  matt his body is the stillness is maintained but you can still feel the heartbeat and you can  feel the pulse of blood through the body from holding the shoulders and then from that  silence you hear weak coughing and the mouth opens and the eyes begin to loll open and the  irises begin to try and find some point of focus and gilmore slowly lolls the head back up and  looks 
none	 into your face and smiles instinctually little blood at the corner of his mouth and he  looks up at you well thats always what i assumed id see in my last moments chuckles  liam bad day huh  matt ah strangely enough im pretty sure ive had worse  laura no offense darling but you look like shit  matt laughs we cant have that can we coughs lifts his hand and begins to try and cast  a spell you can see a bit of arcane prestidigitation begin to try and muster and he  coughs and 
none	 the magic sputters and fades  liam give it time  matt so either were all dead or were all alive id like an answer  laura alive  matt good i was hoping youd say that relieved chuckle i was so worried about you all  i went back for you  marisha what we were so worried about you  taliesin were glad you came here  matt im sorry when they attacked my instinct was to grab the children i got who i could but  uriel pushed me away he was trying to get others out 
none	 of the fray  laura did you see him fall  matt i didnt see him fall but i went back and i found him fallen  sam his body  matt what was left of it i brought back salda and the children i brought back asum and that  abrasive dragon girl i dont know where they are right now  and salda chimes in and goes they both actually they left they went topsoil to try and find other  survivors i told them not to i told them to stay but theyre assumedly off in the 
none	 city  somewhere trying to make sense of all this  taliesin were trying to collect people at our keep  marisha weve turned it into a safe haven  matt well thats kind of you thats good of you thats probably one of the only safe places  in the city right now coughs  liam can you do anything  laura i mean i can cast cure wounds on him to try to help out at all will it help i mean you  know more than i would  matt whatever your fine angel of sarenrae did 
none	 i think will hold me fine for now and he smiles  and gives a very very halfhearted wink towards pike thank you  ashley welcome  matt thank you dearly  liam youve certainly earned your name today  matt i could have saved more i couldnt find you i couldnt i looked  marisha were so sorry  matt oh no i you   taliesin we were hard to find  matt i figured you would be taking care of yourself i went chuckles i went to the dragon  then just in case you had decided 
none	 to be your usual foolish selves and run into hell itself  laura perhaps sent a spy and try to trick him chuckles that would have been stupid huh  sam yes very  laura gilmore we called for you im sorry we didnt wait  matt no im glad you didnt you may not be here  liam did you see any others from the council anyone else  matt well and he leans forward and sits up out of your lap for a second to look at the rest  of you there are quite a few dead 
none	 unfortunately brom goldhand didnt make it most  of the guards are gone half if not more of the cloudtop district killed by the poisonous fume  that took the entire area so suddenly  laura poisonous fume  matt from the initial dragon attack weve been staying here for safetys sake i dont know how  long ive been out could we perhaps make our way towards your place as well  laura it would be smart  sam is there any point to searching for more council members or allies before we go  laura anyone that was 
none	 alive that you saw  matt i mean there were many that were alive by the time i returned they were all kneeling before  the beast its very interesting that when given the face of death before you how quickly folks are  willing to stay alive at whatever cost of morality and sense of society i dont blame them i mean  what other alternative is there but to stay alive and hope that others come and save them from this  burden coughs and he coughs up a little blood and wipes it from his chin  
none	 laura does the cinder king have mind control abilities or is he just super impressive  matt i think its more that hes very persuasive with his threat of how many did not fare this  attack i did get a good look at him before he well  liam hes ripped the heart out of this city lets go  marisha everythings gone  sam when you saw him did you see anything important  matt i did notice in his chest where the scales of a dragon usually are uniform there was an  obfuscation of sorts there 
none	 was something different about his armor it was hard to make out  the details in how fast we had a duel ive never dueled a dragon before ive dueled a dragon now  laughs  laura and fared quite well  matt no i did not i survived longer than i hoped and got out when i could  jason a weak spot  sam yeah did it look like scarring from a previous fight  matt i didnt get a very good look but it looked like there was a different material  something smooth and jagged something 
none	 that pulsed with power  liam doesnt sound like a weak spot  laura that doesnt sound super good  matt i didnt get a terribly good look nor do i understand the nature of whatever it was but  taliesin its the beginning of something something to start thinking about  marisha what do you mean  matt does anyone have any water im a bit parched  travis we got better than that we got a potion and honestly if were going to be moving about on  the streets id like you to not fall open like 
none	 a can of baked beans if you dont mind  matt chuckles im not going to lie im quite touched by your concern grog its flattering  grunts and he starts trying to stand up and as he does sherri rushes forward and grabs him  liam im under too im helping him up  matt you get him up and hes propping himself up what little strength he has hes keeping  himself up and keeping a smile through it all even in this weakened state still trying to  present the best of himself that he can all 
none	 right  sam gilmore before we go one more crazy question youre not a dragon are you  matt laughs oh i wish i was that would have made this whole endeavor a little easier on my part  sam all right  matt but if you find a way for me to become a dragon that would be sexy  laughter  ashley oh gilmore  sam should we teleport or is there tunnels or how do we go  laura could i have just a little bit of time before we  sam oh with garthok or with 
none	 gilmore  laura oh up top you know ill be right back  sam youre going to go up there  laura just for a second  travis all by yourself  laura i mean if you guys want to join if anybody wants to come with me but im going to  stealth like a motherfucker  marisha i mean it seemed like we were heading out are we heading out  taliesin i propose a plan lets get them back to the secret passage i think we should  no audio  taliesin one of the reasons why 
none	 a government allows something like the clasp to exist in a city  like this is because it is a shadow infrastructure that will survive an attack like this it is an  infrastructure designed grog its a bunch of people who are really good at making money when  everythings working and when everything stops working they get very angry and want to make  everything work again  travis yeah i understand that  taliesin so we have a group of people who are wellorganized with everything to gain by this  dragon leaving theyre ready theyre prepared 
none	 theyre probably more prepared than anybody else  would be and they might be willing to help us they have tunnels they have men they have spies  they have everything we need please tell me if im wrong here  jason you couldnt be more right  taliesin they might be the friends that we need at this moment  matt i take it youre one of these underlings  jason i cant speak for the group but i am a member yes  laura would they listen to you  jason im sure they would  laura they 
none	 dont like us very much  jason a lot of us didnt like mordeth either so more people like you than you may know  laura all right  travis where do you want to go  laura i want to go get that fucking well full of fucking loot magical items gold who knows what  could be in there that could help us  marisha wait wait wait you want to go steal from thordak  laura no no no they never gave it to him they gathered a bunch of shit and they hid it in a 
none	 well  sam because he told them to  laura no they were going to get it all together and give it to him but they never gave it to him  travis they were keeping it they were hiding it away in one place  taliesin so a small group goes and gets the gold and the rest of us get gilmore and the family to  the secret passage  sam last time we took a dragons gold five of them showed up  laura the dragon doesnt know about the gold  sam dont you think the 
none	 dragon knows everything thats going on right now im the spy here  laura if youre scared then go with gilmore im going to go get the gold  taliesin i would agree with getting the gold  laura grog  travis ill go with the family  laura gimme the bag of holding then where am i going to put all the gold  taliesin shes got a point  marisha do you all remember the last time i told you something was a terrible idea  laura ive got the bag of holding  marisha it was a 
none	 few days ago  sam it was every time  travis yeah its all the time really  marisha right right this is probably another one of those times  laura i cast pass without a trace on myself and anybody else joining me  sam im coming too  laura scanlan  travis vax  taliesin ill come wait no i should probably go  liam i dont want to go but im not leaving you and i hoist gilmore onto keyleth  matt ah  taliesin weve got you  matt hello chuckles  marisha vax  liam 
none	 im not happy  laura well then dont be pissy about it  liam im not leaving you  laura well be right back i mean its magic shit gilmore im going to get your shit back for you  marisha remember the last time we went somewhere to go get a big pile of shit  matt good thing because well im going to need it to renovate this place a little laughs coughs  laura right  travis hes a fan of it  laura pass without a trace on the three of us stealth like a motherfucker 
none	  sam whos three us three  laura yeah us three stealth out its like a 15minute walk  marisha we were flanked here at gilmores goods what makes you think that theyre not going to  have a ton of people sitting there watching that well  laura im going to look out for that shit this time  marisha yeah that right thats worked well in the past  jason the area where theyre going where the well is is that closer to one of the entrances to  the clasp  matt the one youre going towards 
none	 in the direction its a little bit past where youre  going so youd have to double back to the entrance but it is totally a way to do it  laura look see  sam then were all going to the same place  laura see look at this  im going to stay separate from the group so i can stealth a little bit better  travis twins out in front  laura im stealthing pass without a trace on all of us then  matt stealth checks from all those that are heading towards the well  
none	 laura are we all heading towards the well to jump down to the clasp or is anybody going back  towards the keep right now  jason the wells farther or the clasp entrance is farther  matt the clasp entrance is closer the well is further so you actually go past it  marisha hang on hang on hang on were all going to the clasp entrance  matt thats up to you guys  marisha which is in the same direction as our keep because we have a crippled guy on our  shoulder  taliesin yeah we 
none	 wanted to get the family and gilmore back to the keep first  laura and the kids get them back to the keep  sam cant you treeshoot us treeshoot them there  marisha i dont want to use that in case we need to treeshoot us to vasselheim or somewhere  taliesin lets hold that off  travis were going to the clasp entrance right to go to the tunnels and all the network of shit  that we dont understand because theyll be allies and the people that are going to stealth ahead are  going to go 
none	 to the well  laura i dont think we should bring three children into the clasp  taliesin this was my thought is we take everybody whos down here we get them back to the  castle in the meantime  sam which castle the keep  taliesin keep in the meantime you get the treasure once the treasure is gotten and theyre  back in the keep we get together and find the clasp  laura perfect plan lets go  marisha i grab vaxs hand and pull him back as they pace away  matt okay so as 
none	 you guys all find your way outside of the remnants of gilmores facility the  three children and salda staying very close she keeps the children like right at her sides with her  arms around them protectively sherris at her side as well with her blade out just in case and  theyre forming this circle around the remnants of the taldorei family as those of you continue to  push forward before you disappear keyleth grabs and pulls you  liam splitting off  matt yeah  liam i have to go  marisha what dont wait vax 
none	 vax listen to me  liam i pull away and go  marisha no vax god fuckin you  matt as vax quite literally disappears from your sight after a few steps vanishing into the shadow  of the rubble  marisha i go through to my earring vax talk her out of it this is not the time to be looting for  treasure thats only ever brought us grief talk her out of it  laura 29 39 on stealth for me  matt laughs okay  sam 28  laura plus ten  marisha whos taking the

none	 is trying to  sam garthoks dilemma is a great book  laughter  laura do what you got to do garthok  jason garthoks dilemma is his  travis dont tell us just do it  jason hes got to go towards the clasp because hes trying to make sure theyre still alive  matt as you guys divide garthok still stands there for a second looking back and forth  conflicted by this vex you pick up on this as youre walking away  laura whatre you doing  jason i have to go i have to find 
none	 the clasp its my number one priority its why i sought you guys  out in the first place  marisha we understand weve got the kids  jason ill meet you at the clasp entrance  laura where do you want us to meet you  sam can you tell us where the entrance is do we know where the entrance is  laura which entrance  jason the entrance that i know exists is in the same direction as the treasure so i will travel  with you until we get to the entrance which hopefully is there 
none	 and not destroyed  laura better fucking stealth like a motherfucker  jason ready 14  matt plus ten 24 for stealth  marisha are we all rolling stealth  matt yeah everyone is plus ten  travis 27  sam pike  ashley yup i rolled a 16  laura yeah 26 stealth pike  ashley that was at disadvantage too  matt nice wellplayed  marisha 25  taliesin 31  matt all right so as you guys split off in the rain occasionally you hear the slam of something  heavy echoing in the distance from the 
none	 cloudtop and a guttural yell of frustration  laura im keeping my eye out for any kind of anything in front of us  matt right youre not sure what or why anythings happening but twice during your  journey northward for this you hear a low growl or roar and theres a flash of fire from over the  wall you dont know what happened as you guys push darting through the alleys for the team  thats going for the entrance to the clasp you lead them into  jason a trap booyah  laughter  laura you 
none	 motherfucker  matt that wouldve been amazing  jason ive been waiting to trap you for three hours  matt you lead them into a wine cellar that is locked over with a series of chains you go  forward and you know where there are two triggers for two traps that are part of that entrance you  go ahead and deftly disable both traps through hidden mechanisms you go ahead and pull on one of  the chains and it extends magically as you pull on it almost infinite or at least for a period of  time 
dung	 you find the right link you activate it keeping this all hidden to yourself because this  is what youre trained to do and the chain disables itself or breaks into three different  pieces you then open up the two parts of this cellar lead them down into a regular wine cellar  its very dark theres almost no light down there other than whats pouring in through this  entrance it looks like most of the wine bottles here have been taken out its empty other than a  few small bottles that are set up in this 
none	 vast crisscross of wooden racks and you go ahead and  walk over to one of the barrels and lift up the top of a heavy heavy whiskey barrel pulling off  the top of the barrel the barrel itself does not move as hes wrestling with it as he does he  climbs into and stops for a second looks around and shows you guys that this barrel itself is  actually a chute ladder that leads downward into a subterranean base  laura got it now is all that shit up top going to be open for us 
none	 when we come back  jason i could wait for you here or maybe come with you and get some of that treasure  laura its going to be a while you know weve got to get the treasure and go back to the keep  and come back  sam you can come with us you can come with us  laura i mean its up to you i know you need to talk to the clasp so if you need to talk to them  and let them know were on our way  sam enough treasure to 
none	 go around  jason i could definitely let them know  laura its up to you  jason im relieved that its there and not destroyed so  matt okay so you guys now knowing where the entrance is you make your way back out you close  the cellar and make your way towards where this dwarfs general description of the well is i want  you to make an investigation check  sam all of us  matt all of you  sam 27  travis natural 20  laura youre not with us  travis oh i 
none	 thought he said everybody  matt sorry everybody in that group but congratulations  marisha oh no  travis i escort the kids expertly im a champ at babysitting  matt youve had a percy game today youve had a lot of twenties  laura 19  ashley 20  jason 14  liam 11  matt 11 so you guys take about 20 minutes wandering the area unable to find really which  destination this is partially because a lot of the sections here are partially destroyed or at  least are unfamiliar to you youve not spent a 
none	 lot of time in this northern area of emon  scanlan you dart off for a second seeing a similar crossroads between alleys and you find a  well that very much appears to be and you know its yours because theres a number of copper and  gold coins that are scattered around the base of the well  sam this is it traps  laura i look around can i perceive anything or any people around anything  matt make a perception check  laura natural 20  matt all right you damn guys you glance about and 
none	 nobody is here other than the sound of  the rain that is still smashing down from outside there doesnt appear to be any individual within  visual range right now  sam vex can you scan for dragons please  liam i rolled a 22 for traps  matt okay no traps from what you can tell as you look over the edge of the well you can see  where the dirt has been packed in and given a false or a somewhat muddy bottom to the well  which once held water and around the edges you 
none	 can see where there are a couple of discarded  shovels thrown to the side and chunks of the earth that have been shoved in there to give it  some sort of bottom you also see theres maybe about 20 30 or so haphazard coins in the bottom  empty  sam he got it already  laura dicks dicks  sam talking about dragons  laura no whoever the fuck came and took all the fucking gold  sam the dragons came and got it  marisha yeah thats what i think  laura can i take one 
none	 of the shovels and move some of the dirt to see if maybe its deeper than it looks  matt okay you go ahead and move some of the dirt and you find a couple more coins a total of  35 gold it would be really that you get from it  laura what a waste  sam can we see can i see any signs of dragon claws or dragon slobber or anything  matt laughs there are none around you and you gather from the sheer immensity that is the cinder  king that if he were 
town	 to come down here and retrieve this gold himself most of the adjacent  buildings and the well would be ruined  sam so people put a bunch of gold there then someone else came and took it  jason well allegedly a bunch of gold maybe thats all they found  sam its your fucking people from the clasp isnt it  jason no  laura can i use tracking to see if it looks like anybodys been here  matt sure make a wisdom survival check  laura 19  matt 19 there are a number of footprints 
none	 actually relatively recent that all  laura is that 17 or 11 thats 11 okay yeah  matt yeah okay so looking about you see the tracks pushing northward theres about four fresh  sets of prints fresher than the others you see around it the trail of coins that follow that for  about ten 15 feet you can tell that they were taken in haste you gather by the way its set up  that perhaps somebody else had found this cache before you did  laura i never thought when we came back up out of the 
none	 fucking trap door were the people still  unconscious  matt yeah they were still unconscious  laura oh okay  sam lets follow the tracks theyre fresh  liam are we really going to scrabble about in the mud for coin today  sam well weve come this far  liam scanlan  sam im very easily swayed  laughter  jason what a great leader  liam we should go back to the keep  sam youre right youre right  liam this is a waste of our time  sam but if vex could somehow convince us 
none	  laughter  sam id be open to it  laura look the reason i wanted to come get all of this gold is because i thought there could be a  lot of gilmores magical items that were probably put in here people dont realize what they have  i thought it could help us a lot  liam i understand and it was not a bad idea but this place has been cleared out lets  laura but what if its just one or two people that came and stole everything and we could  totally take them 
town	  sam and theyre like 100 yards away  laura and theyre like right up the alley like right there can i stealth ahead a little bit and see  matt okay you stealth ahead and at this point you follow the tracks that go to the road and  theyre following the alleys as well you can see from the way theyre  liam wait wait wait im sorry one second you know youre very charming but youre a fucking  weirdo and i climb up after my sister stealthily and follow  matt okay all right  sam 
none	 i just shrug i think he was talking to you  laughter  matt okay and what do you two do  jason im going back to my trap door  matt okay so garthok you step away from the group and head back to the clasp  jason thank you for  sam its been a great day killing with you i hope our paths cross again perhaps in the  catacombs  jason i will let the clasp know that youre coming  sam tell them whenever they see scanlan shorthalt to open the door  they stealthed 
none	 so i dont know where they went do i  matt roll a perception check  liam i got a natural 20 on my stealth  sam got a nine on perception  matt you have no clue  sam can i look at the tracks i cant read tracks  matt go ahead and make a wisdom survival check just for the hell of it  sam three  matt three okay you begin following a set of tracks that you think is pretty close to theirs  pike youre with everyone else bringing the rest of them back 
none	 to the keep youre with the other  half of the group  travis youre with me pike  marisha were babysitting  matt you guys are babysitting the family and gilmore getting him back to the keep  ashley oh wait why did i stealth check  matt to stealth with them to get out of the city and well get to you guys in just a minute  ashley oh i thought i was going with them  sam do i even know how to get home from here  matt based on that check you get really 
none	 discombobulated in the center of the rainy midday  of emon  laura i said i was going to be right back scanlan  liam a hand shoots out of the darkness and grabs scanlan by the nose and tugs him off  matt okay all right you guys continue on and following the tracks a little bit they lead  westward and curve down a few more alleys heading towards the north entrance to the cloudtop  laura ah shit fuck it theyre taking it to the fucking dragon dicks  matt do you continue to follow or do 
none	 you head back  laura no well fucking go back  matt okay  sam will you tell me how to get back  laura hey  liam could you say that again with your nose pinched  sam will you tell me how to get back  laughter  laura well get back what happened to wheres gorthok  sam garthok  laura garthok where is he  sam garthok told me he was going back to his clasp entrance our paths will cross again he  also said that you were kind of weird  laura oh well 
none	 i am i start walking back to the keep  matt okay you guys make your way back the rest of you make your way further south retracing the  path you took here since you already know whats there you do reach a certain point where as you  push down one of the alleys a few individuals come out blades at the ready and hey drop your  stuff give us what youve go and then at which  marisha boof  matt laughs at which point keyleth socks one in the jaw as sherri pulls out a 
none	 wand and blasts  one of the nearby pieces of stone off the wall with a bolt of lightning  marisha not today  matt gilmore who steps onto his feet and carries his weight for a second raises his hands up and  as he does you can see arcane bolts whipping around him in this almost moleculelike electron  pattern as he goes do you gentlemen seriously wish to start this ruckus  sam yeah  matt they all go no and they slowly back away and then dart around the corner as fast as they  can 
none	 you hear their feet spattering against the mud  marisha keyleth goes yeah you better run  travis way to tell them kiki  matt as gilmore lowers his hands he begins to fall forward  taliesin and we grab him  matt grab him catch him and hes like breathing hard thats thats the last of me  thats all ive got take me home please  marisha were almost home almost home  matt pinches your cheek grog  travis oh shit  laughter  matt you guys continue to the path as you make your way through 
town	 the groups of the dead that you  passed before a lot of them have since been taken off the street and you can see now graves are  being dug right outside of the gate as you find the south gate do you want to walk through the  fields or do you want to use the same path you took into the secret path into the keep  travis i think the fields would be my vote  laura what  matt youre not there  taliesin no ones noticing us at this point theres too much going 
none	 on  travis oh out of the city is i think the safest way  marisha why wouldnt we take the secret passage its here right no  matt as soon as you say secret passage gren the little boy is like did you say secret passage  marisha i did i did  matt comes up and like ive never seen a secret passage before  marisha do you want to go see it  matt can we see the secret passage the kids seem really excited and you can see salda for the  first time since youve 
none	 seen her smiles a little bit  marisha we cant disappoint the children  travis sighs fine secret passage it is  laura trinkets with you guys dont forget  matt trinkets been keeping guard through the mud behind you  taliesin let the kids ride trinket  matt as a relatively stealthy bear would try as you make your way through the secret passage  successfully finding your way back to greyskull keep you climb up back into the kitchen and there  you can see laina and erwen who are both sweaty their stains are soaking through their 
none	 outfits  theyve been working around the clock to make sure that everyone whos currently held within the keep  is being cared for and fed and their faces immediately light up as you all start pouring out  of the pantry im so glad to see all of you i wasnt sure if youd come back  sam are we there now  matt theyre getting there first before the rest of you and she runs up and embraces each of you  wipes her brow ill have food soon  marisha its okay its okay  matt and

tavern	 the nearest bed would be one of the beds that you guys moved into sarenraes temple  marisha is there someone on it  matt theres someone sitting on it but as soon as you bring someone who looks as wrecked as he is  marisha i say hey beat it  matt yeah they get up and leave and you lay gilmore down  liam but my elbow really hurts  laughter  matt after a short time of getting them established with greyskull keep the rest of vox  machina arrives the rain now pouring heavily outside looking
