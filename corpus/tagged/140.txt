none	 show so welcome to critical  role to give you guys a little backstory as to where we are for those who are tuning in for the  first time oh you are tuning in to an interesting time this party of adventurers were  tasked to locate an individual a famed folk hero a paladin of bahamut named lady kima of vord who  on a vision quest went to search out and destroy a great evil that was germinating beneath the  dwarven city of kraghammer in the cliffkeep mountains the party upon delving beneath the  city 
none	 discovered it breached into the underdark and following her trail fought past duergar  ashyskinned evil dwarves past mind flayers and various other terrifying denizens of the  underdark eventually saving lady kima after weeks of her own torture and discovering that some  great evil named kvarn had unified these normal enemy races the duergar and the mind flayers the  illithid also finding that apparently this individual yes sir  zac we should probably just go ahead and do the giveaway cause we already got to six  matt oh well snap let me finish explaining this and 
dung	 well do the giveaway they discovered  this entity called kvarn this great and powerful entity which apparently had acquired an  artifact known as the horn of orcus that adorns its head that gives it some sort of power imbued  by the dark god of undeath orcus himself the party then managed to find its way into a cavern  where the illithid city yugvoril exists and after a scry spell via keyleth last episode  unveiled this entity kvarn to be a dastardly beholder an extremely dangerous aberration that  currently holds at the top of the 
none	 temple in the city a stranglehold on the mind flayer  civilization so that was where we left off the party slowly encroaching the edge of this island  and well start in a moment once you give the giveaway  zac all you gotta do is let them know to be active in the chatroom and that makes them a part  of the giveaway  matt all right guys so be active in the chatroom that will enter you as part of the  giveaway weve already hit that so the giveaway should be happening very soon so 
none	 say hello  say your opinion be around and have fun  laura say vex is awesome  matt thats right  laura say you love trinket  matt well so its a shame scanlan is not here at the moment since  liam hes stuck hes really stuck  marisha hes stuck on the 5  travis whats the fleshy thing in front of you  laura thats ears  liam these are dried apricots  travis those are huge  matt im just saying its a shame because hes right in the thick of this sequence here so 
none	 as  the party was making their way up the shore they found bits of the ruins that coat the entirety of  the subterranean city they found what looked like some sort of a large stone partially crumbled  fighting pit and what looked as vex vax and scanlan were stealthing over scanlan himself  invisible had stealthed over to scout ahead managed to find what looked like an encampment of  some kind a series of rags and furs a very large living space for some sort of creature scanlan  failing his stealth roll seemed to draw 
none	 the attention of whatever entity lived there which  was an extremely tall large giantlike creature malformed kind of pale purplishgray skin one  squinty eye and one bulging yellowish one that was dragging something fleshy and bloody behind  it it turned towards the rest of the party going to inspect what seemingly created the sound near  its homestead and that is where we left off  liam whats the landscape topography everything  matt right now youre on the outskirts of the fungal forest that covers large portions of this  island where you are right now 
none	 is on the edge of this stony pit thats dug into the ground its  about a 15foot drop down into this pit where the remnants of this encampment was and the leftover  large fire pit thats just slowly burning ember coals  laura and scanlan is still invisible  matt scanlan is still invisible next to you guys  taliesin scanlan also just texted to say dont kill the giant dont kill the giant  laura right okay  taliesin texted while driving i might add dont do that  matt dont do that  travis he wants 
town	 a sex puppet  laura maybe scanlan can just stay perfectly still and you and i can just hide  so that scanlan can  liam thats true were there you said there were buildings around  matt there are chunks of ruined buildings in the vicinity probably a good 30 40 feet from where  you are you guys are right along the edge  laura i think we should duck and hide under his covers his big nasty fur bed  liam all right  matt booming footsteps  laura i go  liam okay stealthing away  
none	 matt okay so the two of you leap off the edge of this down into his living bedding area  laura should i grab scanlan and pull him in  liam no  matt the two of you leap off down both make an acrobatics check  laura ugh  travis come on guys  laura oh god oh its the underdark ugh im switching dice okay thats much better  matt favored terrain makes a ranger very happy  laura that was horrifying  travis she has so many dice now its ridiculous  laura thats a 22  
none	 marisha underdark  matt 22  liam 20  matt 20 and 22 all right the two of you leap off the 15foot fall is easy to tumble through  and both of you land right next to this large pile of rags and furs you both quickly dive inside  laura this is stupid  matt which the instinct of survival prevents you from immediately realizing the terrible terrible  scent of longfestering body odor what smells like a combination of dried blood and some sort of  excrement as well as whatever entities once wore these furs or 
none	 adorned them on their fleshy self  there are still chunks and pieces of them dried andor still rotting within this pile  liam retches  matt so both of you sit there for a second diving underneath keeping as quiet as possible  scanlan is going to attempt to make a stealth check  travis come on buddy  matt all right  laura oh no  matt and ashley all right  matt as this giant humanoid beast starts lumbering forward and you can just barely catch a  glimpse at him because you guys are hiding from 
none	 behind you can see giant saggy fleshy ears  this kind of bulbous nose it looks almost like tumors all across his shoulders and back and his  teeth are kind of broken and nasty theres this black in the gums it just kind of steps and looks  over the edge sniffs and grunts licks his teeth for a moment looks over takes a couple steps  around the edge glances over towards the edge of the forest both of you make a  constitution saving throw  travis constitution  laura against his nastyass scent  matt as 
none	 the smell itself it is a terrifying awful smell  travis or amazing depending on who you are  matt a natural one top of the game  laura oh no  taliesin get it out now  matt natural one gets no bonus that is an automatic fail  liam i should have rolled the one made out of meteorite but i used the jade one  laura why  liam and it all went wrong  matt what kind of a choice is that  travis fucked up yeah meteorite wins everything  orion different energies man  
none	 matt true  taliesin if scanlan were here hed say we need to capture the giant by the way  ashley he would he would  laura okay 18  liam and im saying retches  laura shh shh shut up  matt so vex as you reach over you notice you put your hand up to shut him up but an  unfamiliar liquidy warm sensation hits your hand as you catch him midvomit stream  laughter  ashley oh what  matt you manage to muffle some of the sound  travis you chunked  ashley thats disgusting 
none	  matt this is really disgusting im sorry guys  liam good plan vomiting noise  matt all right the creature suddenly whips its head over towards the pile of rags and goes  grunts and sniffs whats that smell grabs the edge and leaps off the impact of its weight  no more than ten feet from you you feel even through the softness it is still soft through the  nastiness you feel the impact of both of its giant thick treelike legs slam into the stone  right around you  laura make some noise  orion 
none	 what do you mean what do you want me to do  matt scanlan sees this  marisha michael jackson voice thats ignorant  laughter  matt hears this and instinctively without much recourse his invisibility fades as he begins to  form an incantation  laura oh god  matt thankfully hes distracted at the moment but the large entity is going to attempt  liam so helpful if he was here  laura i know i just wish  liam i know hes got a great plan on the 5  matt im sure he does  taliesin 
none	 not texting it to us  matt see if he sent something to me yeah he texted me the same stuff all right  orion guys im just gonna sing a song right now  matt so no what hes actually going to do is hes going to cast domination  marisha thats cool  liam that is what he would want to do  taliesin thats what he would want if he were here  matt so as he finishes the spell the giant creature as he starts reaching and pulling the  sheets back it pulls back right 
none	 as you guys see its horrible gnarled face right in front of you  its nose you can see dripping with liquid from somewhere inside as you pull back your blade all  of a sudden it stops and looks up turns around looking over at scanlan on the edge and scanlan  goes hey go for a walk and the giant okay climbs up to where scanlan is and just starts  walking towards the fungal forest at the edge of the area  travis what  laura maybe call him back here and we can tie him up 
none	 is that dumb  matt i dont know come back scanlan says come back the giant turns around  laura make him sit down  matt sit down it sits down still hasnt made its saving throw  laura oh okay  matt even sitting scanlan is up to its knee  laura wow  matt youve seen giants to an extent at some point or larger creatures an ogre would be about  waisthigh to this  laura can he talk  matt for just reference there thats about the size youre looking at  laura oh so hes 
none	 really small  matt hes a tiny guy tiny guy  travis yeah hes like rudy  laura should we capture him or should we just  matt scanlan goes you wha  taliesin capture him capture him  matt you told me to do something you guys arent there  laura i dont think you know how big he is  taliesin scanlan would say capture him  matt i know thats what were working through  liam vax just backs back into the shadows hoping the giant forgets about him  laura thanks vomity brother  matt stealth 
none	 check  ashley but what if we have him help us fight  liam 27  laura can i bust out my rope of infinite twine and start tying it around him just a lot a lot  just a whole bunch as much as possible because its infinite this twine  matt all right you get about a third of the way through wrapping the rope around his body he kind  of just sits there looking confused at you his jaw looks slack you continue to wrap and as you  are pulling on the second round all 
none	 of a sudden his expression goes from dull slack to angry  travis and laura oh shit  matt he looks down at you scanlan goes oops i think its worn off at which point he makes a  tense physical action against the rope that youve bound him with and before you have a  moment to react with a powerful surge of energy breaks through all the rope that you  had tied him on  laura great  matt you are now standing at the base of him at which  ashley where go for it  
none	 matt you guys are on the shore  liam yeah you guys are way far behind  laura oh should we just run  travis hes outside  laura scanlan is outside  matt go go someone let sam in all right so as this giant entity reaches over and is going to  attempt to try and slam his fist down on top of you  laura ah  matt that is going to be a 21  laura against my ac  matt against your armor class yes  laura oh no that hits me  matt all 
none	 right  laura that doesnt count  matt you take 14 points of bludgeoning damage as the hand just slams down onto your sister  liam i just run up the things back i rolled 27 for that stealth so presumably im  matt presumably he doesnt seem to notice you there  liam  disappearedededed yeah so id like to stab him in the back  matt okay go ahead and make an attack roll on that  liam okay  orion hey youre wearing a cool shirt  travis hey buddy  liam i miss horribly  matt

none	 in a coma  liam nice  ashley hes not just sleeping  matt all right so as its still standing up and you see as hes standing up now hes reaching off  to the side and hes pulling a giant club up that was kind of leaning against the side of the inner  portion of this giant fighters ring  travis good choice  matt as he pulls the club up you pierce him in the arm with the first arrow and he looks down at  you angrily with his one giant eye glaring and the 
none	 smaller one the second arrow pierces the  smaller eye and he pulls the arrow out with his fingers like a little tweezers angrily i will  say because it was a critical hit on a sleep arrow normally what you would roll is 5d8 to see  how many hit points it can affect go ahead and roll 10d8  all whoa  matt its not damage this is just to see whether or not you can put it to sleep  laura oh really  marisha oh hes got to have a  laura thats 12 okay 16 
none	 28 and then i get another  travis four more  marisha ive got access to this thing let me show you  liam youre at 39  sam math is happening here action math  laura wait one more  matt and orion action math  liam aw 47  laura 47  matt 47  orion nice  sam thats some hot math  matt so the arrow pierces him and he pulls it out and you can see for a second  the eye gets a little  laura oh come on come on  matt he 
none	 flicks the arrow off and it snaps as it leaves his fingers and he glares down at you with  his other eye angrily shrugs off the effect  ashley no  laura man that would have been thats impossible  matt that would have been really cool unfortunately he still has a lot of hit points  left sleep arrow is something to glide into later in the battle  travis oh that makes sense  laura oh that does make sense  travis how many wouldve done it  laura he cant tell us that  matt you 
none	 dont know that no fucking youre still on the beach  laura did i still do 47 damage on that sleep arrow or that was just  matt oh no you still did the 30 damage from the sleep arrow  laura okay okay  matt that was just to see how much hit points it would affect if it was going to put him to sleep  but a nice try  laura all right  matt all right so that ends your turn that brings us back to the top of the round between you  guys so 
none	 well wait for the rest to arrive before we do full initiative were just running off of  the sequence of events here did you want to move at all or are you going to stay right here  laura i want to run as far away as possible from him  matt okay so as you start running backward well say to about there he has a very long reach  with a club and he gets to swing at you as a reaction so as you go bolting he just takes the  giant club around whoosh  
none	 laura youre not groggy at all you little  matt streaks it across the ground  sam youre grappled  matt yep which means hes in a bad situation and he because he is grappled it means he cant move  from his current spot hes being held in place his speed is zero  liam checking the stats  matt but he still manages to roll a 14 to hit  laura and he doesnt hit me  matt all right so you jump over the club  laura sweet  matt roll off the ground turn around get 
none	 your bow back in ready position untouched thats the  end of your turn now its his turn  laura oh god  matt he is going to did you throw the daggers or did you leap up to try and backstab him there  liam i tried to backstab him so im right behind  matt right so youre right there he  liam hes gonna shit on me isnt he  matt  spins around bends down just glares at you with his one giant yellowish eye with almost a  slit pupil in it  liam hello

none	 child  liam retches sorry  matt it looks like its yeah the smell is still present in your face pulls its club up to  prepare itself for its next round thats its turn oh no sorry it also makes one attack it  gets to use the evil eye and one attack so angrily its gonna lift up its club and slam down  towards you  liam yes  matt that is going to be a 15 versus ac  liam no sorry  matt cant roll worth crap today club comes down impact sound actually breaks

none	 air like he can somehow fight off the lightning bolt  as the bolt passes through him it leaves this burn mark on his chest and the side of his face  smoke is sizzle up off his torso he looks very pissed  sam do i get my bonus  matt you do  sam can i give inspiration to mister vax over there  matt you may  sam bad flute playing  travis i dont know can you  sam slightly less bad flute playing  travis there you go  marisha yeah some jethro tull up

none	 in the air daggers drawn  slow motion towards its face go ahead and make your first attack since you are going directly  for the eye  liam yes  matt i will say that it is at a disadvantage on the attack but if it hits it will be considered  as a sneak attack  liam say that again  matt i will say its a disadvantage on the attack but if it hits him in his eye you will do  sneak attack damage  travis roll well  liam all right meteorite die  no 
none	 good first ones no good second dagger thats good and thats also good identical so  that is a 26  matt 26 all right that one will hit  liam thank you meteorite die okay so this is 1d durdee durdeedoo  ashley hurkee durkee durkee  liam okay thats a two plus six is eight  matt eight plus your 5d6  liam oh this is a sneak attack  laura because you hit him in the eye  matt oh this is the second attack that you did right  liam yeah  matt technically you were

none	 pop its still a hearty material you actually have to push into it its almost like its full  of hot muscle on the inside of its eye the dagger still drives in and using your weight you drag  down and cut it open on the bottom it screams out in pain and pushes you off you barely manage to  catch yourself on the ground  ashley oh come on  matt you havent seemingly blinded him but youve definitely left a serious  mark on his eyeball  laura ugh hes huge  matt do you want 
none	 to use your movement at all you can or do you wanna stay where you are  liam i will disengage and move back which means that he cant take a swing  matt right you can use your bonus action oh you used your bonus action  to do your secondary attack  liam im pretty sure i get that on top of that as a rogue hoohah but ill stay there if you  want im in no mood to argue with you tonight  matt i know i know  travis yeah right  matt im pretty 
none	 sure as a rogue you can use your bonus action to do disengage thats one of the  benefits but you used it as a secondary attack to get sneak attack so you could move out of the  way but youll take a swing from him  liam okay yeah ill move back  matt all right  liam sure  matt so youd say youd move back to about there  liam yeah  matt as you do he reaches up and grabs his eye with the other hand picks up the club and  backhand swings at 
none	 you thatll be a 19  liam that hits  travis couldnt just let him go in the trees  matt you take 19 points of bludgeoning damage but as the hit slams into your back you manage to  just catch your feet underneath you so you dont topple off the top of this edge  liam okay  matt ends your turn what you got vex  laura hi im going to do hail of thorns on him  matt all right so you pull back  laura yeah  matt same wooden shaft all of a sudden

none	 of his elbow causing him to drop the club on this hand he looks extremely  frustrated at the process now hes got blood streaking down both arms  travis yes  matt he reaches down to grab the club again to try and prepare himself for  another round of attacks  marisha are we there yet  matt you guys are just now arriving  laura oh  matt the fomorian is going to finish its turn and then the rest of you guys can go  taliesin yeah  matt hes going to take two swings first

none	 around you ill assume that youre no longer a naga as you cast a spell eventually he  gets to his full height and stands there looking down at all of you kind of glancing around grabs  the large hardened piece of wood and stone that hes fashioned this club out of and glances and  says to you you translate for her where  sam where  travis a man of few words  laura he wants to know where  orion i saunter up hello  travis christ  orion im really impressed are you our friend 
none	 now  laura tiberius do you speak underdark  marisha i dont think he can understand you theres a translation barrier going on  orion oh well wonderful tell him to follow our orders thats all he needs to know for now  marisha i already told him that  orion oh good  marisha hes in our posse  sam hes asking where we should tell him  travis temple  laura but tell him to stay for now  marisha well you here for now  sam shes going to translate  marisha you we roll together

none	 you all feel the actual  impact on his body just the nearby presence the air around him being pushed looks at you for a  second looks back to keyleth and gives a solid nod and just stands there  marisha i take that as a good nod  laura will this keep up while youre sleeping just curious  marisha it keeps up for 30 days  orion 30 days  laura oh were set  travis awesome  orion i walk up to the giant and i take out my jerky  laura can we heal him 
none	 if we heal him will it cancel it  liam vexahlia  laura what  liam ask him what his name is  matt his hand reaches down and completely envelops your fist and just pulls away jerky is  gone from your hand and you feel probably a few scales went with  laura i grunt at him and ask what his name is vexahlia  orion do we all have to say it that way vexahlia  matt just glares at you  laura oh come on  ashley im going to tell him hes handsome speaks undercommon 
none	  laughter  matt the big eye squints in confusion at the tiny thing and just keeps licking the remnants of beef  jerky off his fingers that it just robbed tiberius of  orion he likes the jerky  ashley i thought id try  marisha what should we call him  laura i think we should name him  orion we should ask his name and be polite  sam we did he didnt give it  laura we should name him tiny  marisha tiny  sam tiny thats clever  taliesin vax and i are still 
none	 getting something out of there  matt all right so the two of you guys move towards the pit youre what now you are  taliesin im lowering him down on a rope  matt okay you hold on you get down the spikes now that you are up close you can see are about  five and a half feet in length  liam yes  matt at the base about that wide and pretty nasty jagged covered in whatever rust soot ash  found its way there  liam tetanus yeah  matt its nasty times its going 
none	 to be a little careful to get in there without hurting yourself  liam all right  matt go ahead and make just a straight dexterity check  liam thats a 25  matt 25 you manage to mission impossiblestyle swing underneath grab the rope you manage to  keep yourself at a lithe side angle where you reach between two of the jagged spikes reach down  and grab this metal pole that was shining pull it out and its an intricate  gold and bronze javelin  sam you found booty  liam pull me up well i 
none	 cant use this  laura what is it  liam its a javelin its beautiful  travis will you inspect it  sam beautiful things should go to pike i think  ashley oh scanlan but she has really good aim  liam she doesnt really throw sharp pointy things this would be good for you big guy  sam i just feel that the gold of the javelin would match the gold of your heart  ashley oh scanlan  orion im going to inspect it arcana check 23  matt 23 okay  liam im still holding it 
none	 tell me about it  orion oh this is of course the javelin of lightning this javelin is a magic weapon when  you hurl it and speak its command word it transforms into a bolt of lightning  sam sounds a little ready  orion yeah  laughter  orion you know what im not on the clock you read it  laughter  sam bolt of lightning five feet wide basically its just lightning but in a javelin  matt pass it on to grog  liam i spin it rotate it in my hand handle towards grog 
none	  travis singsong i have something thats magic  matt all right so  taliesin oh boy  ashley what are you going to name it  travis penelope  matt you guys now stand on the outskirts of yugvoril were a little ways from yugvoril and  the fungal forests in the distance you can barely see the dull greenish glow of what  encompasses the top of the temple what is your plan of action as youve now bound a fomorian to  your will  laura i feel like we should hop down into the pit  
none	 sam fomorian  liam of spikes  laura no no no not that pit in the big pit and rest and that way were blocked from view  taliesin heal our what are we calling him  laura tiny  taliesin tiny heal tiny  marisha hes a fomorian  sam just before we rest does anyone have knowledge of his race and his species any of his  weaknesses or strengths can i do a history check  orion ill do a history check  matt well this will be more of a  sam thats a one  
none	 orion nature check what kind of check  matt yeah this would be a this will be just a nature check  marisha what are we checking  sam nature check just to see what are his strengths and weakness what about his race  marisha ooh the fromorians well the fromorians  matt fohmorians  marisha formorians  matt fohmorians  marisha fohmorians  sam fohmohreeans  marisha fohmohreeans  taliesin accent is just terrible  matt whatd you roll  marisha an 18 plus ten so 28 fomo  matt all right between you and your understanding of 
none	 the underdark as well you  manage to suss out a fomorian is a longcursed species of giant that lives in the underdark  specifically thats why its form is so malformed and physically messed up they are inherently very  evil very selfish creatures and the fact that you even have it in your presence says well of your  magic but also means its probably very very very minimal in its control or ability to really  help you unless it absolutely has to  orion the giant guy  matt so  marisha yeah well i mean 
none	 it sort of has to  laura right  sam it doesnt have to do it with all its heart  marisha it starts to fry his brain if he doesnt  matt sometimes things might want to take damage depending on what you tell it to do  laura oh  orion it depends on what we say  laura well can we ask him  matt just saying youre riding a very fine line keeping this thing not thrashing and smashing your  head right now  laura can we ask him i mean if kvarn is annoying 
none	 to him or if he likes him  matt you ask in undercommon  laura yeah  matt the best you can get out of his response is the equivalent of i dont really know or care i  hunt i find things that wander too far from this city and occasionally squash a dwarf or two  sam do we know what sorts of things he either hates or likes  taliesin weve got a distraction  travis and laura yeah  taliesin forget the fight we can just send him off into the city and that should be 
none	 enough for us  to sneak in  sam thats pretty good too  laura yeah thats true  orion i am not setting foot in that temple quite yet  laura no no no well come up with an idea but i mean its something keyleth is it safe to  sleep next to him or is he going to attack us when we sleep  marisha we might be able to box him up or maybe we should chain him up while we sleep or  something i dont know i mean he should be okay  liam 
none	 take the watch like we normally do  matt kima looking at him says im not sleeping next to him  sam ill sleep near you kima  matt her eyes for a moment seem to dart to your shoulder where you had previously shown her your  awkward purple third nipple im fine scanlan but i i appreciate the offer  sam suit yourself  taliesin thats just a sentence you dont hear very often  ashley i have a question you said hes a cursed giant  matt meaning not him individually his actual species long ago it 
none	 was a line of giants that was  cursed by the fae to be this horrible form  sam well lets rest  laura yeah  sam in shifts  laura maybe we can chain him up to something while we sleep  sam no we dont want to seem aggressive towards him  laura oh fine  orion hes fine for 30 days  laura whos taking the first watch all right  taliesin ill take the first watch  laura i gotta heal up  liam ill sit up with percy  marisha well hang on what are 
none	 we doing from here because its going to dictate what i pick  sam thats a good question were not going to mount our full attack are we  laura are we  taliesin why not  orion no we are not  taliesin and laura why not  sam we could  orion i am telling you right now i am not setting foot in that things lair  laura okay tell us why  sam until when  orion until we figure out a damn way to get it out of that lair  sam you want it 
none	 out of the temple  orion absolutely  taliesin were not going to be able to do that  orion percy im saying this right now im not stepping foot in that lair  taliesin thats fine were not going to be able to get him out i dont think  orion i think we can actually  taliesin well  orion my idea is this  laura okay yes please tell us  orion with the new addition of our giant friend we do have a great advantage we can definitely  make the distraction as you say i 
none	 propose keyleth and another stealth member somehow see a  way if there is some kind of ventilation that leads into the major buttholes chamber  laura the temple that you wont set foot in  orion yes  laura you want somebody else to go into  orion absolutely  laura all right  orion and when finding this craft some type of piping system where we could smoke him out if he  has to breathe which i believe aberrations need to breathe and eat  laura do i know that do aberrations need to breathe  matt 
none	 best that you understand not a lot of study has gone into the breathing apparatuses of certain  aberrations and the few that have been close enough to a beholder  havent really tested that theory  laura all right  orion if we smoke him out and he cannot breathe he must leave the facility and if we go in there  we would be at an extreme disadvantage in many ways than we realize  taliesin how are we going to smoke him out  orion i just proposed the idea i dont know but thats what we 
none	 all need to figure out  laura okay ive also got an idea i mean what about that whole plan to break apart the apparatus  that was holding the elder brain together  taliesin thats my thought  laura i think we need to go over the top once the distraction is in the city blah blah blah go  over the top acid that metal break it apart  sam or giant that metal  laura i think itd be hard to get the giant up to the top of the temple  marisha but we can send 
none	 the giant beating on the front temple door  laura but this is a brainstorming session everythings positive  sam well not everything  laura acid whatever break it apart release the illithids from his control and then well have  them on our side at least not our side but against him  orion thats what im talking about  taliesin absolutely  orion oh so there are prisoners right  laura all of the illithid in the city are his prisoners hes controlling everyone  orion oh so im sorry i was misled earlier so this is the 
none	 good part of the plan we do exactly  what youre saying first  laura oh okay thats good i like your plan so far  orion clarota here will rally the illithid to fight for us thats when we  smoke out the beholder  taliesin except of course by doing that weve destroyed the roof of the chamber so there will  actually just be nothing but ventilation  laura yes  marisha no it was already open remember  orion we do it a different way we dont go near him  ashley do we know that 
none	 its enclosed  marisha no its open  taliesin its open  sam i can get the giant inside the temple  matt the top has the brass crossbar  laura ooh i like that  travis but what if he just controls the giant  laura you know what though the beholder will just take control of the giant  taliesin that were talking about destroying  marisha some sort of glass  matt some sort of translucent material that fills in the parts that arent the brass  taliesin that were talking about destroying  orion the room 
none	 that hes in is sealed up  matt it appears to be  laura i think we should keep the giant as a distraction  travis i also have an idea  laura yes grog  travis ice cream and peanut butter mixed on a cold stone  sam it will never work itll never work  orion oh my god  ashley oh yum  orion that is incredible  travis ive been thinking about it for days  sam how would you get the stone cold enough you would need all sorts of sides to add to it 
none	 to  fold into it its a terrible idea  travis i told you i dont like thinking  laura and then also another idea what if you used your pillars right against the beholder and  trapped him in can you do that  orion i am not going anywhere near that temple  sam all right  laura all right all right what if youre outside the temple and you cast pillars and then  we go in and you stand outside tiberius  orion i mean i suppose that could work possibly  laura what if youre 
none	 on top  orion just has to be line of sight right  matt to where you want the pillar to come out of yeah  orion mmhm right yeah actually that could work i could do it from afar  maybe on the carpet  laura that gives us something to hide behind right at least with his eyeballs  orion yes  ashley we still have to go through the fungal forest right  laura yes  sam how far is the forest before the city  matt all right so to bring the map on top here 
none	 where you guys currently reside which is  this portion here you imagine based on the distance you traveled you have about a mile or so  before you get to the city  laura a mile  matt maybe a little over a mile  ashley man i wish we had some cold stone right now  matt actually probably a mile and half before you get into the city which is about two miles from  the temple  travis right doesnt that sound amazing  liam we need to find a frost giant first  travis im 
none	 just saying we could leave this fucker here go mix some peanut butter and ice  cream everybodys happy  sam that plan is growing on me  ashley well sleep should we nap  sam lets take a rest  laura what are we going to do were just going to go in without a plan what are we going to do  ashley hows vaxs foot  sam tomorrow we can stealth in and get some intel  matt its already been attempted to be healed this day  laura oh we can do it in the morning 
none	  matt yeah its like a once a day kind of thing  travis liam we need you to stealth in and get some awesome recon but that means  youll be at risk  taliesin were going to need to destroy the mechanism  sam a suicide mission he was born for this  laura the big one is releasing the elder brain we need to do that before we teleport  marisha yeah okay heres my thing why do we need to do reconnaissance we already know what we  need to do  taliesin weve already done 
none	 reconnaissance  liam well we saw through keyleths scrying  laura right so we know whats going on  liam somewhat  taliesin we know that theres a mechanism inside that room we know that thats probably whats  keeping the brain  ashley we should just go knock on the door  laughter  ashley hello  travis i think pikes onto something  sam we should do some recon there might be beings or creatures around there that we can  distract use to our advantage something  laura i feel like we should get up close release 
none	 the giant fly up over do our shit and then take him  sam all right but we dont know how were going to break that thing  laura acid  sam we dont have acid  laura we have acid  sam how much  orion i bring out the yellow vial  laura and weve got a bunch of acid in grogs bag  sam we do have that yellow vial  travis we have four acid vials plus that  orion this is the thing thats going to hurt the most  sam we dont know it 
none	 could make it stronger  marisha well i mean i could do some heat metal and weaken it  ashley i feel like we should save that acid for the beholder  travis remember the argument was also that it will be magically treated to withstand simple acid  marisha the elder brain casing was not necessarily the cross  taliesin i want to experiment on the i want to do a couple things i want to first take using my  little kit i want to just beaker off a tiny bit of it and expose it to some 
none	 organic matter to see  how it reacts  matt okay  taliesin and expose it to a little bit of inorganic matter to see how it reacts  matt so you take a bit of the swirling yellow orangeish viscous fluid out of you place it  against some organic matter which you find somewhere in the vicinity partially rotted chunks of  taliesin flesh  matt  flesh from the pile the fomorian was sleeping on as you place it on it blackens the  flesh around it there is a sizzling sound  taliesin interesting now i 
none	 want to try it on some inorganic matter  matt which organic matter which inorganic matter  laura do we have any metal  sam i have a dagger that i never use  ashley i have some rusty instruments  sam great rusty instruments  ashley from the torture room  orion do you have a rusty trombone  groaning and laughter  orion sorry what i dont understand  sam i use my minor illusion to create a failure horn sound  laughter  taliesin i would like a couple things i would like one of the rusty 
none	 instruments and i would like  one of the diamonds please  travis yeah here you can have it here  laura no oh percy why  taliesin so that we find out if its going to be useful if its just acid it wont do a thing to  the diamond  travis how about a sapphire  taliesin or a sapphire fine  travis my fine blue sapphire thats been in here for a year and a half you can have it  liam care for some cold stone  taliesin and some cold stone i want to 
none	 try it on some ice cream with peanut butter  laughter  taliesin i want to mix the acid in add some raspberries  matt so youre putting it on  taliesin on one of the rusty instruments and on a sapphire  ashley whats a rusty trombone  laughter  sam oh pike  taliesin shutting it down  matt shouts google will answer that at the break  marisha dont google it  sam chatroom please help out ashley  laura no no no dont  matt so as you take a dab of it and you place 
none	 it on the rusty instrument which actually looks like  some weird hooked crowbartype implement the rust immediately cleans off and the metal underneath  begins to slowly warp and bend and then dissolve at the place where you dripped it  sam good thats good  matt placing it on the sapphire it kind of coats it slips off and begins to burn the ground around  the sapphire  taliesin interesting all right  sam good on metal  taliesin good on metal not so good necessarily on  laura on jewels thats okay  taliesin if the 
none	 glass is glass the glass will break if the glass is something else we may have  to burrow through it  laura sapphires okay then is it clean does it have any acid still on it  travis its coming back to me dont reach for it  taliesin im going to clean off the sapphire  matt clean it off it looks like there are very very minor pockmarks across the surface but yeah  taliesin were good were very very good  travis ill take the sapphire back  marisha i can possibly ill make sure i 
none	 learn heat metal and i can heat the edges of the  crossbeam and then if we can have grog bring something heavy after weve weakened it  laura i know i think a big weight once its been acided  sam how about a giant  travis i could just jump on it  laura well its on the top of the temple thats what i mean if you can jump on it then well be  going down with it  travis highpitched yeah thats all right  orion it will simply just heat it  marisha hot 
none	 metal bends  liam weve had a lot of success flying around right what if and i dont know who does what  but what if one small group flew in with tiny in the form of a mouse and then  sam dropped him  liam with instructions and drop him and in midfall a cursed giant lands at the front door  and if youre on the flying carpet dropping him you get out of there  laura what if cursed giant lands on the metal beam after weve already weakened it  travis yeah i like that 
none	 more  liam thats good too  laura yeah that is good  liam but he could go apeshit on us  laura no no no not if hes alone up there what if we do it do it do it  sam i think what vax is proposing is to create a diversion down there while we work on the metal  try to weaken it  liam half the team gets into position on the top of that thing the other half splits off drops  the giant the giant goes apeshit for like a minute right drawing 
none	 help away from the  beholder drawing attention down there we wait for a minute then start pouring acid and grog  smashes it with his fucking forehead  laura and travis yes  marisha can you levitate or do something to move a giant boulder that we can drop on top of it  orion of course i can  liam can we recap on your you looked in using your magics and you saw tell us what she told us  laura can we remember i have advantage to recall information  matt essentially what you had seen 
none	 in the vision was within this room there is that giant brass  gold bronzelooking structure that almost like an upsidedown christmas tree it comes to a  spiraling point above the elder brain pool which is in a raised platform in the center of the room  to one side there are two large cages that contain what look like some sort of skinless  creatures that are currently being experimented on on the far end of that room there is a table  that was set up with implements this is probably in the process of what kvarn 
none	 has been just  having fun toying with flesh on the opposite side of the room it was shrouded in darkness and that  was where you saw kvarn reveal itself out of the shadow  travis one question if we break the thing at the top and the upsidedown christmas tree falls into  the elder brain pool thing are we going to kill all of the illithids in the city in one fell  swoop  marisha well according to clarota it was pretty heavily  matt which at this point as you say that clarota goes that 
none	 is not an option  orion not saying it is clarota  ashley no were just trying to see if maybe we could  laura we didnt want it to happen we just were making sure it wouldnt  marisha you mentioned that the elder brain was pretty protected from physical damage that there  was lots of magical enchantments and stuff  orion ooh thats right  matt it is a powerful entity but it has its limits in its currently weakened form  laura okay what if you cast featherfall on it as right when we did it 
none	 and then we can move it  out of the way  orion doesnt quite work that way it works on creatures im not sure i could do this  taliesin i have a terrible idea  sam great lets hear it  travis im full of those but lets hear yours  taliesin what if we break the fall of the device with clarota  laura clarota what about why clarota  taliesin oh so sorry  laura the giant tiny  liam kima he means kima  taliesin no im saying what if we lure it into the 
none	 center of the room and then drop the ceiling  on top of it  marisha oh you mean  laura kvarn  all kvarn  matt clarota is currently stepping back with a look of confusion  taliesin im a bit tired im so sorry  sam your name is confusing to us this is why we wanted to call you clarence sorry sorry  matt at the term clarence you see the tentacles go  laura oh hes warming up to it i think hes liking it  orion clarota how much does the crystal weigh  matt 
none	 i do not know i was not around when it was created i didnt know it existed until you saw  it i have not been in the city in months nearly a year  taliesin i think it is definitely an option though if we can lure it out of hiding and get it  into the center of the room  laura i thought the elder brain was directly below it so it would have to step on the elder  brain in order to  taliesin is the elder brain directly below it  sam seems too 
none	 complicated  liam its not one large mind right  matt its a series of the way you saw it it is a cluster of brains that are kind of merged  together into one large hivemind mound  liam and laura okay  travis who wants to go up on top  laura me  travis who would want to go down  matt yeah less a crystal and more a metallic structure  marisha what if instead of letting it fall before we fully break it we take the rope and  rope it  laura or chain 
none	  marisha and chain and then lift it and then take it away  taliesin and laura or just swing it  laura so it doesnt fall all the way and it goes at a pendulum  sam complicated engineering  orion keyleth what did the structure look like again  marisha it looks like a beehive  travis like phantom of the opera  sam and its made of metal and glass  matt its a slowly like a spiraling mass of metallic pipes tubes metal bands that just  slowly twists and comes to a gradual point like 
none	 an upsidedown christmas tree  sam so if it falls it would be bad on the brain  laura right yes we can swing it  orion many structures like this we wont have to maybe do any of that if we could just  merely bend the structure i believe that would compromise the magical integrity usually  structures like this are designed for a particular arcane reason if we were to merely damage it  grog you could just as you do to most things  travis are you looking to me to bend it i was like 
none	 can you metalbend this is awesome but you  want me to get my sweet hands on it  orion i mean i could probably help as well along with clarota but thats an option  travis how do i get to it though i mean if we break  laura flying carpet  travis no i cant it doesnt carry me  orion it would only carry you  matt it could carry a grog and thats about it  orion right  travis i could be like that pilot at the end of independence day thats just flying 
none	 up into the  laughter  travis im back  liam so you are randy quaid  travis randy quaid which ive always aspired to be im in ill do it  liam are we 100 certain theres no nooks or crannies or holes or anything we dont want to  go have a look  sam yeah we should go have a look tomorrow morning  marisha go have a look why youre just going to get caught  sam why because no were not going to get caught  liam youre assuming we know everything there is to 
none	 know about this structure about the city  around it  travis were talking about a chance to gamble with his life lets let him do it  sam yeah we should go we should know all we can know  marisha im just wondering what more youre going to find out from a flyby that i couldnt find out  from my vision  liam well i dont know how to tell you the things that you dont know yet because you dont  know them  orion hold on vax are you planning on going alone thats silly 
none	  liam take this guy  orion thats even more silly  laura because all his stealth checks lately have been perfect  liam he can go invisible well just take a peek  ashley should we do it should we nap and then you guys go  laura lets do it lets nap  travis lets do it nap we nap and rest  matt all right so you guys take an evening of rest well take this as our break our little  quick tenminute break guys well make it quick so we can get back to this 
none	 because we have a lot  to try and cram into this evening  liam united as one  matt so well see you guys shortly wait do we have a  zac i have a quick announcement  matt yes  zac so malcadale malhadale was the one that sent you guys  cheering  matt thank you so much  ashley huzzah  laura i love him  orion he sent me this  travis grand merci  matt yeah  zac that was actually for matt and i wasnt going to call it out on screen  
none	 orion well im keeping it  matt i think you should keep it it has a dragon  zac i got in trouble for saying it was yours  orion yeah thats fine  matt i think the mouse is actually keyleth so the staff  zac im not sure those were sent from the mouse and the bear were sent by somebody else so  just yell at me in the chatroom and tell me whose that is ben funkinator won the first giveaway  taliesin yay  zac and we are only like 23 away from another giveaway 
none	 and heres the thing guys since that  next giveaway is at 3000 which is a huge huge goal of ours ill give away three signed photos  and three signed books instead of one giveaway well do three giveaways to celebrate 3k and i have  notified some of the troops that we could possibly hit 3k subs so they are on their way back to  dance with us tonight some of our people you guys dont have to stay but youre more than  welcome to except i was told by erika that if we hit 3k 
none	 subs you have to dance careless whisper  with her thats what erika told me she was like  travis without your shirt on  zac that has to happen if we hit 3k  orion all right how many are we away from that  zac were only like 23 away  ashley thats fair  matt i will say if were pushing to go to a dance party after this since this is maybe a climatic  slightly overtime game then we got to take a very short break  travis yeah yeah like five minutes max  
none	 matt and zac fiveminute break  matt see you guys here in a second  orion lets go  dramatic music  travis right listen up if you have ale then you have a friend in grog strongjaw a goliath of  towering height and size this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life  combat women and ale chuckle  record scratch wait  easily the brains of the group grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes  colors and chuckle shiny things  also ale  in his early years 
none	 armed with his twohanded great axe grog often enjoyed proving his might  amongst the ranks of his familys wandering herd but after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly  gnome in the woods he objected to the killing of such an innocent life a creature of impulse grog  felt only pity for this well this terrified little thing and his disobedience cost him  dearly  beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader his uncle kevdak grog was abandoned and left to die  exiled from his herd it was then that the relative of the very gnome 
none	 he fought to save  saved him it was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike that healed grog bringing him back  from deaths edge and they have remained close friends ever since  most nights grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches ha or accompanying  scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors  also ale  marisha a first impression of keyleth would leave you with little information on the halfelven  druid you might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is  kind 
none	 of sweet chuckle  of course it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions thunder under that  unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose natural powers have  made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants literally soft chuckle  born to the air tribe of the ashari people keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and  the elemental magics it is her peoples inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in taldorei  where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm  since 
none	 she was a little girl she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities  well if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts which i do clears throat  anyways it wasnt long before the headmaster of the tribe her father korren realized her true  prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster  just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization  teachings from ancient traditions and exceedingly high expectations every druid leader to be must  embark on a 
none	 journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect  amongst the fellow headmasters they call this the aramente or noble odyssey when her father felt  she was ready he set her on the path to truly discovering herself not knowing when or if she  will ever return  as she hiked down the mountain towards stillben she meditated on the task ahead part of the  aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior a valiant protector and a wise and compassionate  leader with this knowledge one thought plays on repeat in 
none	 her mind is she even worthy  taliesin percy was the third of seven children born to a noble family who lived far to the north  in the ancient castle of whitestone with so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship percy  turned his attentions to the sciences engineering and naturalism  one day a mysterious couple named lord and lady briarwood came to court during a feast held in  their honor the briarwoods violently took control of the castle killing or imprisoning everyone who  would stand in their way  percy awoke chained in 
dung	 the dungeon only to be freed by his younger sister together they fled  chased by the briarwoods men as they ran percys sister took several arrows to the chest  and fell percy kept running eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to  freedom he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat he barely remembered the next two  years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible  then one night percy had a dream a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who  destroyed his family 
town	 when he awoke percy began to design his first gun gunshot  ashley pike grew up on the outskirts of town near the bramblewood her ancestors were a family  of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation thievery destruction and trickery  left them with the curse of the last name trickfoot sarenrae the goddess of healing and  redemption had other plans for pikes greatgreatgrandfather wilhand who left his  family at a young age after a dream a dream that changed the course of the trickfoot family  wilhand devoted his life to sarenrae and pledged from 
none	 then on that him and his family would live a  life of service and devotion  as a child pike seemed to have an affinity to heal whether it was animals people or even  flowers she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken she  studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic  she lived a peaceful life quiet and simple until one day wilhand was captured and almost killed by  a group of goliath barbarians one of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of 
none	 the innocent  gnome and he himself was beaten bloodied and left for dead abandoned by his herd wilhand went  to pike for help she prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could bringing him back to life  when he awoke  dramatic music  matt welcome back  zac cool good game good game bro  matt yeah we hit 3000 on the break  cheering  zac yeah thats impressive you guys are awesome so to enter in the giveaway you just have  to be active in the chatroom it could be as simple

none	 you  can nothing catches your eye although occasionally you see a little bit of movement  very slow movement just outside of your main light radius along the edge of the top of the pit you  guys slept in just kind of fade in and out something just drifted away eventually you all  come to your fomorian friend is just sitting there in a very unfriendly aggressively passive  manner just staring at the rest of the group expectantly  travis i offer him a sip from the cask of ale  matt he takes it in 
none	 his hand which to him looks like a small mug  travis right just a sip  laura oh hes going to drink the whole cask down  ashley hes going to drink the whole cask  matt he peels the top of it off breaking the wood  travis dont do this to me dont do it  matt gulps  travis i will fucking kill you  matt shattering noise  laura oh  travis i would like  all grog no no no  ashley grog well give you a whole thing of it  laura hes

none	 in your mouth  laura oh tiberius some farts look at those farts  orion i figured hed like that  travis i run up his fat chest and i headbutt him in the face  sam oh shit  matt okay  travis its my cask of ale  matt as grog rushes up in a blur of angry motion you see a trail of froth in the corners of his  mouth as his head comes colliding into the giant im going to say for this go ahead and make an  athletics check  liam tune in 
none	 for the beholder fight three weeks from today  travis natural 20  ashley oh shit  matt can you check for me  ashley that is a natural 20  travis you dont fuck with grogs cask of ale  ashley clerics dont lie  sam oh god thats our giant  liam hes being true to himself  ashley and hes dead  travis hey it might be like a fomorian thing he might like it  marisha oh god can i do something  matt so as grog runs up fullforce angrily slams his goliathskull into this 
none	 large fomorian  underdark giant you hear what sounds like a clap of thunder nearby and you swear for a second one  of the two heads are about to crack or explode from the sheer force of the impact you see grog  whose head is approximately a fifth the size of this entity has hit it with force so strong that  in that breathless moment youre waiting for grog to scream out in pain with blood pouring down his  face however it is the fomorian who reels back from the force of the blow his giant 
none	 eye closing  in severe pain before he falls onto his back stunned groans  travis you owe me a cask of ale  matt as grog stands over staring down at it its only partially reminiscent and in your fury you  didnt realize that you shouted at it in giant it looks up at you and gives you a nod of momentary  submission as you step off of its body onto the ground walking away extremely furious  travis im grieving now leave me be  laura oh my god  matt well that happened  ashley 
none	 amazing  liam crisis averted  ashley i go over and pat him on the shoulder  travis tearfully my cask of ale  ashley its okay grog ill get you ten casks of ale  travis all right  ashley once we if we live  travis i have allergies down here  orion i pick up a piece of the cask i take my wheel out whizzing noises  laura what are you doing  liam hes mending the cask  matt the mending wheel continues its process  travis ive had that cask for two years man 
none	  matt the mending wheel completely forms it into a pure untouched perfect empty cask  travis thank you tiberius  sam we will fill that cask with ale  liam theres your woobie you can sleep again  sam this is a promise cask  travis thank you woobie it is henceforth it shall be called woobie  laura good job tiberius  orion i was trying to tell you that before you hit the creature but it worked out  sam all right shall some of us stealth ahead to the temple to see what we can see 
none	 or should we set  out on foot as well  laura wait do you want to do his foot first  liam i was just about to say does this look normal to you  laura groans oh come on  laughter  liam you know ive got a lot of flexibility back and it feels stronger but it doesnt look quite right  laura it looks disgusting  ashley all right all right lets do it so i have to roll medicine  matt you roll medicine and what level healing you want to use  ashley were 
none	 going to rest  matt you guys just rested everyones spells are back at full  ashley oh we just rested shit  matt just keep in mind what spells you want to have prepared and keep in mind what may be ahead  of you so be sparing i recommend  laura ugh get it out of my face  sam yeah its just a foot dont go crazy with it pike  liam i just want to be able to sneak better  ashley how do we know how much is left on we dont  matt it 
none	 looks like its had advancement  liam this is like the fourth time weve done this  ashley so 20 for medicine  matt rolled 20 for medicine  ashley yeah  matt all right and what level healing spell are you going to use just keep in mind the battle you  may have ahead of you  ashley i know shit i dont know what level to do it at since were going to the whole thing  laura do it level one  ashley level one  laura sorry brother  matt so 1d8 plus five  
none	 ashley all right  matt mark off a level one spell casting  laura its almost healed  ashley im sorry  laura we got a big battle brother shouldnt have fallen asleep in that  ashley ten  matt okay so that and the medicine check part of the scarring from the lava burns that still  remains begin to heal over most of the scars are gone youre on the cusp of getting past your  disadvantage but not quite yet  liam its not nothing  laura sorry your nubbin lives  matt all right whats the 
none	 plan  sam yes what is the plan are some of us setting out on foot or are we just sending  travis yes the stealthiest of the stealthy go  sam on foot  laura no no no on the carpet  sam on the carpet okay  travis yeah a little recon and then we  sam just recon  travis yeah  sam all right im with you  marisha i go ahead and cast enhance ability for dexterity on scanlan over here  sam what does it do  matt gives you advantage on your dexterity 
none	 checks  travis is it just dexterity you can enhance or anything  matt no and skills that are dexteritybased so stealth would have an advantage which is nice  all right so we have scanlan there we go look at these guys here on the new carpet  laura thats adorable  marisha new carpet  ashley thats awesome  marisha its advantage you get to roll twice  matt so as you guys hold place the two of you drift into the air  laura be careful  sam its just us two  matt just the two 
none	 of you  sam farewell pike ill miss you  ashley sings goodbye my love  sam what my love  ashley no no i well its from a movie that i saw  orion pike what is a movie  liam like a puppet show  ashley oh its just like flashing pictures that all move together  orion oh like light like that  travis it flashes  ashley it flashes  sam all right off we go  matt the two of you hop onto the carpet and begin to slowly ride up past the treetops of 
town	 the nearby  fungal forest as you curve upward into the air  sam sings i can show you the world  matt  you get a very fine view of the city proper you can see a lot of these buildings in  the outskirts of the city are rubble they have fallen in on themselves they have collapsed you  can see pieces of foundation and ceilings and rooftops that have caved in and right in the  center of the city is a very easytosee temple which in itself is essentially a pyramid with a  flattened 
none	 top there is that dull greenish glow that seems to just slowly trickle around the very  top of the temple as you are just starting to crest over the top of the outskirts of the city  proper id say about here are you guys going over the city are you following the outskirts  whats your plan of recon you guys are currently now moving this way  laura plan whats that  sam i leave it to you  liam well were moving pretty fast i say we go all around the rim of the city  
dung	 matt all right both of you roll stealth with advantage  liam advantage you said  matt he has advantage  liam i got a 14  sam 18  matt 14 18 okay so you guys begin to crest around and you look down and its very very  dark there are what looks like these greenish spores that found pockets in the city that give  off light this very very faint luminescence within the city and they get thicker and thicker  and cluster and make the center of the city more bright and easier to make 
none	 out the details of you  dont know if these were placed there or if they naturally grew there and just add the ambiance to  it but what you see in that little bit of light as you glance down are many figures walking and  moving through the city  liam what figures  matt and sam many figures  matt you can see humanoidsized individuals gliding through the city 20 30 50 illithid  visible in one section of the city each carrying two to three slaves each some trolls ogres  other dwarves other creatures of 
town	 the underdark that at this distance you cannot make out their  form but there is essentially a thriving community down here of mind flayers some of them  its hard to tell where theyre going but there are some going to and from the temple carrying  small satchels or boxes as they glide or actually they wouldnt be carrying it their  slaves would be carrying for them and theyre keeping alongside them as you continue around the  side here you start getting more into the ruined area and this part of the town itself on this 
none	  side is mostly nonfunctional its abandoned and you can see the repurposed city construction by  this colony has started in the center and over the past few hundred years or as long as its been  here its slowly building and repairing outward as you crest around this side you can see a far  ruin about another half mile to a mile off from where you are too far away to catch any details  of it you cruise around this side and you hear this squeaking sound this squeaks and you  glance up and you 
none	 see what looks like a cluster of bats moving to the top of the cavern theyre  almost buzzing you guys in the head up above ten 20 feet ahead of you theyre just coming  back and forth over you  travis sentries  ashley yeah sentry bats  matt you guys take it a little lower to kind of get away from that eventually the bats stop  harrowing you you find your way back around come to rest back at the camp  laura well  liam and just to clarify the part where we saw all 
none	 the illithid figures was  on the opposite side right  matt it was around this section here you saw in this portion of the city which is the only one  example the best you can see around this this whole intersection right around the temple is  pretty fairly populated with mind flayers and their slaves  liam voice breaks so the  travis pubertys a bitch  liam voice breaks yes well im only 62  sam we need that big brain on our side  liam yeah the city is crawling with illithid but more on 
none	 the northern edge not so much here on  the side and its a lot its not a few its a lot  laura its a city we need the elder brain  liam we need a distraction though thats the only thing i took away from what we saw  sam unless we all go in from the top  travis tiny and i had a meeting of the minds we could provide a distraction  laura you wanna go against illithid  travis i dont give a shit  taliesin he does not want to go against illithid 
none	  travis chaotic neutral baby  liam yeah but theyre going to take you over big guy  laura theyll take you over and then well fight you  liam heres what i think is better we take tiny transform him into a mouse we fly over just when  were over the right part of the city flick him in the mouse nuts and toss him off and then let  him turn him back into tiny as he falls into a pile of illithid and keeps them busy we need to  draw as much attention away from 
none	 the beholder as possible  laura i like it  taliesin and marisha i like it  sam what will we be doing in the meantime  laura well be going in over the top trying to get rid of the thing controlling the elder brain  orion we do not want that  travis yeah theres going to be collateral damage  orion no i like the first half of that idea vax  liam the nutflicking part  orion no that idea will work as well too i think what we should do is do the mouse thing 
none	  whoever i guess we make the effort to go in however we can manage to get into the top of  wherever we are going to attack those beams as it were to do damage to the thing controlling  whatever  laura yes  orion thats when we should lightly drop him in as a mouse because when this takes enough damage  which he should as a mouse the spell will wear off and he would poof back into whatever we  should do it right on the beholder  laura actually i agree with that  
none	 orion because that i think would be more a distraction for the creature a beast against a  nasty beast is always a good fight  laura if hes being controlled by you can he not be controlled by another being  marisha it probably would be a contest of wills  liam and he could turn the thing on us pretty easily im willing to believe  marisha well what if we how about this why dont we turn him into a mouse and we can just  keep him as our you know emergency pocket mouse and whenever 
town	 if we need a quick distraction then  we flick him in his mouse nuts and drop him over and  taliesin his poor mouse nuts  laura i like it  orion we need all the people in the town alive clarota will be upset if we hurt anybody and we  need their aid i suggest because i have a feeling that because this is his lair he will  have and im talking about kvarn he will have advantages that we do not understand if we go in  and we will have disadvantages  travis we 
town	 dont want to go in  orion exactly  liam were all open to an idea to get him out have you got one  orion im saying that is why so if we threw our rather large friend here in and do the thing  that will get us control and clarota can help us manage everyone in the town  even the slaves will rally  laura they dont like clarota they arent going to listen to clarota especially if theyre  controlled by another being  travis yeah they did exile him  matt clarota puts the 
town	 thought in your mind immediately basically this very strong  realization that without the town freed i have no leverage with my people  orion thats what im saying after weve destroyed the mechanism  taliesin yes thats the plan  marisha after weve destroyed the mechanism yeah  orion right thats why we cannot attack the town  travis so are we saying we want to go up to the top we want to try and weaken the cross with the  yellow and the acid we want to drop titmouse the giant on the thing hopefully if it 
none	 breaks if  it doesnt break then what do we do  sam we rage  laughter  liam and also i dont understand were talking about crashing the thing but arent we risking  at least risking dropping the upsidedown pyramid onto the elder brain  marisha thats why i was saying if we can  laura were going to tie a chain to it  marisha i think if we tie a chain to it i think we break the beams and then airevac it out  personally  taliesin i think it might be too heavy  
none	 sam evacuate it via air  laura i feel like that uses way more time because whats going to happen is once it happens its  all going to go to shit so once we drop it we should probably just fucking go  marisha well then how about this why dont we concentrate instead of because okay its a  middle cross beam thing right why dont instead of focusing on the middle section we focus just  on two sides so it goes  taliesin thats a good idea  sam may i throw a wrinkle into things 
none	 those bats didnt look good those are eyes that hes using  to watch things above so we gotta get through the bats first or distract the bats or get rid of  the bats  orion bats will be a problem bats catch fire rather quickly if i recall  laura maybe keyleth you could turn into a bat and tell them all to go a different direction  marisha i can talk to the bats or i can dominate a bat i could talk to the bats  taliesin this is assuming the bats are going to be 
none	 a problem  laura if it comes up well deal with it how about that  marisha ill make sure i can talk to the bats  taliesin im not afraid of bats  sam no no no the bats will ruin our element of surprise  laura none of this is a surprise  taliesin do we have really an element of surprise at this point  laura none of its a surprise he knows were here  ashley onward ho  taliesin onward ho  travis lets do it  sam we dont even know what were doing 
none	  travis quit tiptoeing into the ocean lets run into this  matt kima has finished wrapping the leather on the handle of the great maul that shes holding  grasps it in her hands her armor freshly polished after waking up this morning looks at the rest of  you and says are you ready to walk into the great halls of the warrior minds before us  orion and marisha no  ashley do you have any ideas real quick or were you hearing anything we were saying kima i just  mean theres a lot of ideas 
none	 thrown out but do you have any idea specifically  taliesin do you have anything to contribute  matt kima looks at you for a second and pulls her own holy symbol out and says the guidance of  bahamut has not steered me astray as of yet and your deity also has brought you down here for a  great cause i think as long as theyre both looking over us and we are straight and true with  our intent we shall be fine as far as the tactics they seem sound as long as we can  
none	 maintain the element of surprise i feel that if that is given up we may have to improvise  improvisation scares me  laura okay okay  matt so everything we can possibly do to maintain a very quiet arrival is going to be the  key to success in this  sam so thats either a distraction or taking care of bats  marisha i mean i could fog cloud us we could look like a big floating cloud  sam yeah but if we float then were going to float right through the fog  laura what if 
none	 we use a giant net and two of us get up on the carpet and we use a big net and  catch as many bats as we can  matt does anyone have a net  laura do we have a net  taliesin we do have a giant piece of leather that makes us look like rock  sam grog had annette back in emon she was great  liam i still think we should drop tiny on top of the or at least near the main illithid  encampment to keep them busy kvarns eye will turn 
none	 there for a moment  taliesin we can and we can attach the camouflage back onto the flying carpet  sam we have camouflage  taliesin we do  matt clarota motions for a second and says we also have to consider this temple has doorways in  and out this chamber that kvarn has taken has ways to be opened and outside forces in do we  have a way to seal these entrances if we are to do this fight so we dont have any additional  visitors  laura oh good call great do you know where 
none	 those entrances are  matt kvarn thinks for a second and says  laura your names clarota im sorry  matt there are if i recall two doors to the room not large  travis he doesnt need doors right he can make portals and shit  sam no no hell need a door to let in other people  marisha well heres the thing are we trying to actually were not trying to get inside the  temple  sam yeah we are  travis no were trying to keep him from calling in a fucking dragon or something 
none	 he cant  dimension door in a dragon and be like just kidding  taliesin he can call every single creature in the city to come to his aid  travis but he cant  taliesin more than enough to deal with us  matt not if you damage the device  laura we can just drop things in from above on the temple and stay out of the temple  matt if the device is damaged he no longer has sway over the illithid  taliesin so then we want people to come into the temple at that point 
none	  matt perhaps  orion no thats when we get out and smoke him out  taliesin were not going to set him on fire  laura maybe just give up on the smoking out  travis i think hotboxing is now no  liam yeah  ashley if i were to use divination soon how long does that last  matt divination  laura is that the one where you call your deity  matt oh you mean divine inspiration  ashley divine inspiration im sorry  matt that happens the moment you use it  ashley it happens 
none	 the moment you use it  matt yes  ashley okay  laura so we would know if shes going to help us or would she help us that moment  matt its not so much hey god come with me its more like please help me right now  something may happen that turns the tide  ashley so is that something just a question that i would do now or maybe in the battle  matt maybe in the battle  ashley okay  matt like the moment you need the help is the moment it will happen 
none	 most likely  ashley lets do that all right just was having a moment with god for a minute guys  sorry im back  sam can we before we make this journey can we sound off whos on what duty  laura right  sam whos on damagingthedevice duty whos on  travis i could give the four acid vials to whoever has the yellow liquid who wants that  responsibility  taliesin ill take  ashley i feel like we should use some of that though for the beholder  taliesin i want to save as much of 
none	 it for the beholder as possible  ashley okay  travis the yellow liquid  taliesin yes  travis so who wants to pour the acid on the cross i could do that but its  laura percy well are you going up top  travis im at everybodys disposal  taliesin im going to head up top also in the fight ill be more use from a distance anyway  sam whos on the shuttingoffthosedoors duty is that a thing that we need to assign to  someone  marisha could you fashion  laura that could be keyleth 
none	  marihsha  like a paintball  sam that could be you but youre not going to be there youll still stay behind  laura yeah you guys could you guys be in charge of closing up the entrances  taliesin do we have any spare glass vials  travis we do  taliesin can i have one  travis yeah i give him a glass vial  marisha well im flying people overtop im assuming  taliesin can i have a spare arrow vex  marisha i think we should all be on top together i dont think we 
none	 should try and separate  taliesin can i borrow a spare arrow  laura sure  marisha a sparrow  taliesin a sparrow  laura here you are  taliesin i have a second i want to see if i can make a crude acid arrow out of a glass vial  laura take it give it to me after its done  taliesin its a shatter a straight up shatter arrow  matt because of the rushed nature of this go ahead and make a roll  taliesin its a proficiency bonus plus  sam i will inspire him 
none	  taliesin thank you please  sam sings everything is awesome  sam and taliesin sings everything is cool when youre making an arrow  matt roll a d10 add it to the roll  taliesin ah thank you oh my god  marisha aw  taliesin yeah nine  matt nine as youre attempting to fashion it to the arrow unfortunately the vial shatters in  your hand you take three points of acid damage  taliesin ow i wasnt aw i wouldnt have put the acid in yet okay fine  matt it happens at the process of 
none	 you setting it up  taliesin damn it all right  matt based on the roll you made  taliesin im having bad rolls for this stuff man  matt better to get them out of the way now then  taliesin so that didnt work  laura damn it good try good try percy  marisha im trying to figure out a way we could just conserve the acid like if i could  taliesin im just going to pour very gingerly  marisha okay yeah  taliesin im going to just pay attention  marisha okay try it 
none	 gingerly  sam and when he attacks us what do we do  laura okay yes good good thinking  marisha are we going to fight him now or are we going to try and run are we going to try and lure  our way  laura stay up top as long as possible  orion if youre talking about fighting kvarn in his lair when he attacks you  laura were not going into what if we can just attack from the roof  from the opening in the roof  liam your plan is to lead the 
none	 charge into kvarns lair thats what youre saying do i  have that correctly  laughter  orion absolutely not vax  laura is that possible can we attack from the roof from the opening in the ceiling can we  attack him from up there we dont have to go in  orion possibly yes  matt kima gives a nod to that and is like im useless at that range but we have a few members  of the party that excel at that  laura maybe we drop the thing attack from above as long as possible 
none	 and hope the illithid attack him  travis sorry one last question so his eye cancels out magic right  taliesin yeah  travis so the more places we make him look the more of a chance we have to get it away from the  magic users right  laura and taliesin yes  travis so instead of just two people why dont we do all three if there are two doors and the  skylight why dont we have three teams so he has to pick which one he looks at  laura nobody go in the temple 
none	 everybody attack from outside  travis i mean i can take one of the doors at the bottom and try and keep people from coming in  taliesin thats a really thats a really good idea actually  matt clarota pipes up and says the two other doors are accessible from only within the temple  if you had two parties to enter the two other doors they would have to go through the entire  subfloor find a way up which youre welcome to try but who knows  laura oh i was thinking it was just like a 
none	 giant pyramid with one roof  laughter  orion that would be the bestcase scenario  laura that makes so much sense though that its not  laughter  taliesin to be fair traditionally thats very similar to how pyramids are built  travis okay what else were you going to say  matt that was all clarota had to add to that  taliesin it was a good thought  marisha we could still take a similar approach and just have weve already decided were going  to have two teams to be on two separate ends to do 
none	 the slidey the hingey maneuver and then have a  third team thats kvarn distraction duty  laura yeah oh god  ashley do we do distraction duty maybe people who have really high  laura so this is the beam and were going to attack this one and this one yeah  marisha right so if  sam were effed  marisha so weve got this pyramid and theres this cross beam you said right matt  matt yep  laura oh is it like that oh god im picturing it so fucking different  marisha and theres this 
none	 top of it which is open  laura okay  marisha so this is the pyramid  laura yeah yeah yeah  marisha you can see and then the thing is if you can see through it  the thing is hanging down  laura like that  marisha and it looks its all spirally  laura okay  marisha and then here is  laura the elder brain  marisha the elder brain  orion and wheres beholderface  marisha somewhere in here  laura so were going for one side of it  marisha so if we go 
none	 for  laura and it hopefully goes  taliesin im just going to keep breaking im just going to keep  breaking hinges until it swings  laura okay  travis is anybody interested in going underneath the pyramid with me  taliesin you technically you could really go underneath it  laura i feel like youll be fighting a lot more things i think its better to just go from the  top and drop in if we have to  travis okay  marisha drop in if we have to and yeah  travis and just scatter to 
none	 different areas so he has to look around  taliesin keep him looking around  travis we cant stay together  taliesin and remember that if you dont use magic and especially you have one magic attack  dont try and use magic when the main eye is on you  travis no no yeah butthole only  ashley all right are we going up  taliesin lets i think we should try this  marisha so okay okay hang on what happens if this starts going poorly  laura then we run  travis which its bound to do

none	 occurred to me  laura okay  sam it could get us into the temple a different way but not into the chamber  travis okay  sam i could make us all look like illithids  taliesin theyre psychic  travis hell read our minds hes already in our heads  sam he could read our minds but well be outside  matt clarota turns to you slowly and says piercing in your mind with a force of honesty and  almost condescending essence you will make it ten feet before the  brain is pulled from your skull

none	 when its dropped there  marisha well right now you are going to be mouse  travis good good  marisha and then wait for me to finish my thought stay with me and then you fight kvarn  you kill beholder  laura eat food big eyeball  marisha eat food yes delicacy  matt licks the side of his giant club which you can see is covered in this horrible mixture of  moss and rotting entrails from whatever he smashed the other evening licks it off and goes eat  all right grunts like slams his chest 
none	  sam i make him a mouse  laughter  orion there he is  laura oh my gosh tiny youre tiny  matt most confusedlooking mouse youve ever seen if there could be an expression of what  the fuck on a mouse its on that one  laura he still smells really really bad  liam whos throwing whos throwing him  laura oh ill just keep him with me  ashley i scratch him behind his ears  sam all right lets go  matt whos on the carpet  liam the way we always do it

none	 on the carpet  sam us too  matt trinket cant be on the carpet trinkets too heavy for the carpet  laura can anybody shrink trinket too  sam is trinket worth it  laughter  laura scanlan scanlan  sam theres just a limited number of spells  orion oh no he didnt  taliesin wow  sam of course trinket is worth it i was saying i was being bizarro scanlan  laura yeah who can shrink my bear  matt keyleth are you hawk carrying the gnomes  marisha no were all magic carpeting  liam 
none	 no we cant all fit  matt you can fit six people on the carpet  liam this is what we always do you carry the gnomes  laura can you cast fly on trinket and ride him ill ride him if somebody casts fly on him  marisha can we heres the thing if i turn into a hawk i wont be able to turn into an earth  elemental  travis we dont want to sacrifice that  laura no  taliesin why dont we is it possible to drop off a group and then go back and 
none	 get the rest  a taxi  travis yeah why not can we make two trips  ashley we have two carpets now matt  laughter  ashley we have two carpets now  matt no  laughter  matt it doesnt work that way  ashley i tried  taliesin it was such a good try  travis we have we have two carpets two carpets  ashley we have two carpets  matt boulder falls smashes party  laughter  matt all right so  travis were going to make two trips and come back for seconds okay 
none	  orion two trips wait what why  matt so first shift is  marisha the stealthiest  sam dont take offense but we can leave kima she cant do anything for us up here she has no  ranged attacks shes useless in a sexy way  laura thats not a compliment scanlan  matt kima looks you dead in the face and says regardless of what your plans are im bringing  this hammer onto the head of that foul abomination  travis yeah she means it  orion yes of course but outside here with me  
none	 matt i know i will not survive this but i will be damned if i dont dent its face before i go  taliesin which is why were picking you up in the second group  orion and lady kima you must survive because you must tell allura of my deeds for no  particular reason  travis yeah its not like youll be there to collect  matt noted  travis on the you know props if you die  matt second trip first be quiet  taliesin yes stealth stealth  marisha stealth people first  ashley stealthy 
none	 should go first and thats not me  travis and well fly the carpet back  laura you promise youll take care of trinket if i go  travis right so well fly and then well fly the carpet back  laura can trinket go in a smaller group hell fit on the carpet if theres a smaller group  matt too heavy unfortunately its a big bear  liam hows he going to get from the top of the pyramid down in maybe he should hide here and  live to tell our story  travis hes going to 
none	 drop me off on the first trip take fly off of me hell get on the carpet  come back for the second group and fly trinket  orion no youll keep fly up because i can just hop on the carpet  travis thats what i mean once im up on the temple you take it off of me and then you can  put it on trinket because ill be chilling on the top  laura but thats casting it twice  orion im casting it twice  travis which you cant do  orion but trinket can 
none	 get on the carpet  laura no he cant ride the carpet we just said that  taliesin trinket should stay with the boat as opposed to fighting the beholder  orion he needs a diet  taliesin those are your options is trinket fights a beholder or trinket stays  matt as youre having this discussion trinket comes over  laura trinket  matt rubs his nose along you and gives you a look of like a very stern stance of essentially the  feeling is trinket wants to be by your side for this  laura yeah trinket 
none	 wants to be by my side you guys  travis how the fuck do we get him up there  ashley all right whos on the first carpet  marisha someones burning a spell or were going in shifts one of the two  travis we are doing shifts right  taliesin yeah  laura we dont need to if we burn a spell because trinkets the one that cant fit on the  carpet in the first place everybody else can fit on right  matt mmhm  marisha so were picking one rather polymorphing trinket  orion wait 
none	 a minute hold on  marisha or were casting fly on him  orion hold on a tick how much can you lift grog  travis i mean i weight 645 pounds so a lot  orion so a shitton  matt grog is not strong enough to carry a bear and you on a fly spell  marisha what if we cast fly on the bear  orion no no no i mean one at a time  ashley its a good idea though  sam were still doing shifts then  matt you can try theres a good 
none	 chance he might drop trinket on the way over from that height  which would be a splatter bear  marisha can you cast fly on trinket and then have grog ride trinket  sam its the same issue  marisha is that the same problem  ashley what if one of us ride trinket  laura well but grog wont fit on the flying carpet this is a really  this is like a mind puzzle  matt kind of yeah  ashley how long does it take to make the trip  matt from flying over there on 
none	 the carpet at its full speed  liam scanlan and i flew over there  matt id say itd take about 20 minutes or so  laura 20 minutes  sam to fly a mile  matt 15 minutes  orion i cast fly on trinket  matt the carpet isnt extremely fast  orion oh wait and ill do that ill wait because i can only do it one at a time so ill  burn it for him  travis okay  orion lets go  travis lets do it  sam wait what did you do  
none	 orion ill burn it for trinket the fly  laura so we can both fly  marisha so we can all fly  orion not right now no  matt all right so  orion well go up first then ill come back down with the carpet ill cast fly on him and whoever is  matt so first batch vex vax percy scanlan grog is flying all right grogs there  sam youre staying  orion ill stay down with trinket  marisha who else can go is there room for one more  orion because i dont need 
none	 to go up  sam oh what are kima and clarota  ashley theyre hanging out with pike  matt and well say clarota will go with you guys because clarota can stealth kima will stay back  laura i cast pass without a trace on the entire party before we all take off  matt good all right as you guys all continue forward lets see keyleth  are you going with them  marisha no i stay behind  matt all right  sam im going to in front of us using minor illusion im just going to 
none	 create a floating bald  eagle thing to distract the bats with  matt okay  sam its just flying around  matt everyone on the carpet make a stealth check clarota goes invisible  taliesin whats the bonus for pass without a trace  orion plus ten  travis 21  sam stealth isnt dexterity is it  matt hmm yes it is  orion 23  laura and you add ten  sam 23  matt you add ten to it  liam 36  travis oh plus ten  orion yeah  travis 31  matt there 
none	 you go  taliesin 30  laura 18  matt 18 total all right  travis still alive  matt okay you guys make your way  travis he rolled three times  matt  over to the temple  sam the bats  matt the bats dont seem to take any notice of your passage you find your way slowly coming  towards the temple that dull eerie green glow towards the top the carpet finds its way just  along the edge to the point where you can safely step off on that little fivefootwide section of  
none	 walkway that surrounds the glass top and you do see it it is a relatively large seethrough  almost glasslike substance its hard to say it looks like glass its about a good three inches  thick and the metal beams themselves are bolted into the stone itself  taliesin theyre bolted into the stone itself  matt yep  taliesin i would love to while were here very quietly examine  sam wait when weve arrived is anyone going back no  marisha yeah people were dropping people off  taliesin someones going back  sam whos going back 
none	  orion im staying on the carpet  taliesin so hes going back  sam and youre going back to pick up the others  matt and grog slowly flies over and meets up with you guys  liam i thought you stayed back  orion no i had to go with you so i could take the carpet back  ashley theres enough room now for the carpet to go back and take all of us  orion so i can come back with the carpet  matt yeah  orion because theyre dropped off  laura okay so 
none	 you dropped us off  matt did you roll a stealth check  orion shit  laura oh no  orion thats 19  laura plus ten  orion yeah  matt yeah okay  orion thank you  matt so you guys are left at that point now  taliesin i want to examine the structure to see if i could find the optimal place and the  weaknesses in the structure whether or not its more appropriate to pour the acid on the stone  whether its better to pour the acid on the metal just to see 
none	 where it would be weakest  mathematically  matt go ahead and make a perception check actually no this would be investigate  taliesin investigate  matt yeah  orion before i leave to go back down vex  laura yes  orion when you see it be sure to mark the beast  taliesin 19  matt all right you gather best that you can that the metal itself is essentially bolted  overtop onto the stone if you were to run the acid along where the metal is overlapping and  bolted down on the top that would 
none	 weaken it significantly the stone itself is not going to  help much but where that boundary is where its essentially clamped that area right there is  going to be where you want it to put a bleed through and coat  marisha awesome  matt all right are you going back for the others all right are you guys just standing  carefully on the edge  laura are we waiting  travis we are definitely staying out of any kind of visible sight of the giant meatball  matt okay all right tiberius you head back  
none	 orion yep  matt all right eventually grabbing the rest of the group here  marisha can i go ahead and cast pass without a trace on the rest of us  matt all righty pass without a trace second time thank god  laughter  matt you cast fly on trinket which is a hilarious sight as this large brown armored  bear all of a sudden is like confused bear noise it takes a good  orion trinket trinket think of vex go to vex go to vex shes up there  matt as you say that trinket 
none	 suddenly straightens trajectory a little bit and starts  finding this awkward zigzag  laura thats so cute  matt but nevertheless is finding some sort of purchase in this strange flying environment you  can see if a bear could have an expression itd be bewilderment confusion and slowly trickling  into joy  orion its very cool  marisha its so cute  sam im flying  matt as you all begin to drift back over towards the center of the city if i can get a stealth  check from everybody including trinket  ashley and we 
none	 get a plus ten  matt plus ten everybody on the second trip  orion 23  matt all right  marisha 34  matt all right  ashley 39  matt all right and for trinket  laura oh um yeah thats  ashley plus ten 16  laura no plus ten would be 11 because he rolled a one  liam i saw it  sam im flying  orion its your first time its going to be a little rough  matt as trinket continues floating behind the carpet you hear this familiar bat squeaks  sam 
none	 bats  matt  sound as a cluster of bats begin to descend from a darkened portion over the cavern  theyre about 60 feet back  orion how far away is it from me  matt about 60 feet  travis dont do it  marisha i turn and i seeing the bats come in in bat language in like you know echo bat noises  taliesin the bats say what are you clicking at us  marisha echolocation i tell the bats dont worry about it go home  ashley nothing to see here  orion forget about 
none	 it  laura forget about it  marisha were running an errand for kvarn dont worry about it  matt go make a persuasion check  sam persuade those bats  laura inspiration inspiration  sam im not with her i dont even know this is going on  matt it doesnt matter what you roll you cant persuade bats theyre bats  marisha oh but i had a good roll  matt i know but you cant persuade bats  marisha but i had a good roll  matt but you cant persuade bats  orion i thought you 
none	 said roll  matt i was just fucking with her  orion oh  marisha i cast speak with animals thats what i cast it was a spell  matt oh i did not hear that i thought you were just trying to do that  laughter  marisha no i said i do this i cast speak with animals  matt i somehow missed that phrase or that never came up in the conversation anybody else hear  speak with animals as a spell  laura i heard her say i cast  taliesin i was looking at the 
none	 page  matt okay i missed that okay so  orion i think you said i cast talk to bats  matt so what was your persuasion roll then  marisha 18  matt 18 okay okay now this comes into play good i somehow missed the spell this was a  really funny moment of keyleth in my head i was like what is okay  liam go home bats  laughter  liam go home  travis we all start going go home bats  matt okay the cluster of bats you can see there is this odd 
none	 green glow around them that is  slightly reminiscent of the top of the temple they seem to shudder in place as youre giving off  this strange series of squeaks and echobased sounds and they seem briefly rattled as opposed  to going away they just stay in place as you guys drift further and further away  orion hmm good  matt you dont know what that means but  sam it could be anything  travis lets do this  matt youre not getting chased eventually you guys come down youre now landing around the  outskirts 
none	 of this  liam he could be watching us for all we know  orion i stay on the carpet  matt you stay on the carpet all right so  travis oh were so finished  matt what are you doing while they were off what were you doing there percy  taliesin i was examining and ive got four vials of acid  matt okay  taliesin ive got the three that we had and then ive got the fourth super thats a  marisha its really distracting  taliesin thats an omen of things to come  
none	 marisha i hope so  matt who has the mouse by the way  laura i have the mouse  matt okay  taliesin so im going to start by taking our normal vials of acid and im going to pour very  gingerly right at the sections i want to crack and start letting it burn  laura while were standing there i pull out an arrow and im tying the little  tiny mouse onto an arrow  travis and i also pull out my climbing equipment and my 200 feet of rope out of the  bag 
none	 of holding  matt all right  travis and start putting the climbing gear on  matt all right make a stealth check  laura pass without a trace  travis 23  matt 23 okay  marisha does he get double pass without a trace  matt you take no  orion are there any jutting stone things anywhere around its just flat  matt no its smooth stone surface surrounding this glass top percy as youve placed the acid  around the two sides you kind of slowly move around and trickled along where the metal beams  
none	 reach the stone the acid is having an effect but its a very slow  taliesin okay im going to take the major bottle of acid and im just going to  sam before he does can i im going to just see if theres any magic protecting these the metal  or the joints  matt arcana check  orion i should do it too  sam 23  matt i mean there is a magical aura to the metal itself it does not seem to be protective in  nature it is more of a best you can 
none	 tell a transmutationbased magic probably something that  is directly affiliated with how the effect its having on the elder brain  marisha well do you want to work on one beam and i can maybe do a focused soldering on the other  laura can anybody cast dispel magic  sam yeah of course  sam but it doesnt seem like the magic is protecting the metal  taliesin im going to just im going to get the more intense acid im going to just im just  going to use the tiniest bit i want to maintain as 
none	 much as i can i want to start working on it  matt you use a tiny bit and it does hit the metal with a sizzle and begins to dissolve the metal  but the actual metal material also balances the acid with a little bit so essentially you begin  carving into it but the little bit you use doesnt keep burning through it burns to a  certain point and then just loses its acidity  taliesin okay im going to keep gingerly slicing it through until its just being held the minute  it starts to 
none	 give im going to shift to the next one  matt you make your way about halfway through the vial before that one platform you feel is about  halfway or more dissolved through  taliesin all right im going to take the other half and im going to work on the other  matt stealth check  sam is there any purchase like can a hand grip the metal pole  matt its built in a way thats almost smooth entirely of the top like the construction  taliesin 29  matt 29 okay so you empty the rest 
dung	 of the yellow vial on the other side you can see the  actual metal the area where you dip it the kind of yellowish liquid hits this kind of smooth  shiny bronze color and the leftover material is this like thick horrible dark green color the  way the two mix and dissolve you empty the last of the vial and the other beam gets about halfway  dissolved through before eventually the last of its used up  orion as i do this i go to the bag of holding and i go to the endless rope 
none	  travis she has that actually  laura i have that  orion oh  sam youre not with us you stayed on the carpet  orion yeah i know  laura hes right there though flying next to us  orion and the endless rope as im asking for that i take out my immovable rod and im going to  place it kind of in an exit position and clicks make it stay right above there  matt all right as he releases it this rod is now stuck in midair anchored permanently until  removed by a 
none	 click in that position  orion and i start flipping through the rope so it goes the whole time im just doing that so it  goes all the way down  matt okay make a stealth check  taliesin whispers grog grog were going to need a lever were going to need wrench get a  blade into the metal into the iron  orion 25  taliesin and wrench and youre going to get the second one  marisha okay okay  taliesin but it should give  matt all right so youve dissolved a portion of the 
none	 two metal beams on each side you guys have a  mouse kind of tied to an arrow  laura hes secure  matt whats the plan  travis okay  marisha ill take one side and grogs going to take the other beam  sam and do what  marisha im going to start im going to take my staff and i do a concentrated heat metal spell  and im just going to kind of solder right along the inside where its already weakened  matt okay you understand the spell heat metal is less of a localized 
none	 damaging the metal what it  does is just causes a metal structure to in itself become hot  marisha right  matt you would not be able to necessarily damage the metal with it what you would do is youd be  able to weaken it universally possibly with enough heat  its not like a blowtorch or anything  marisha well then why dont ill heat the metal while grog is prying it to help  laura it could also hurt grog if hes touching it if its that hot  travis ive got a wooden handle  
none	 laura okay  marisha hes using like a crowbar right  taliesin using an axe id imagine  travis yeah  marisha well well tag team it then  matt so youre attempting to pop  taliesin yeah were going to stick down and just pull  sam loud  laura what if we just give old mousey here turn him into a giant again and drop him right on it  travis its not weakened enough yet is it  taliesin its not weakened were going to  we have to crack it  matt kima looks there and 
none	 says at a certain height i imagine it would work  marisha yeah but we want to save him lets see if we can do this first  taliesin well yeah lets this is not going to be loud well it will be loud once it breaks  travis we get him in place and then try it and if it makes a noise we just drop him  laura ive got him notched on the arrow  travis shoot him up and have him come down  marisha well we can have tiberius hit him with like a quick 
none	 damaging spell and make him  sam we can fly up and just drop him down like a big giant bomb  travis we need him to fall like king kong from the empire state building  sam we can take him up up up and just drop him  taliesin yeah we do have a flying carpet  sam how much does he weigh  matt the fomorian you imagine probably weighs oof  sam a ton  matt id say three to five tons  sam thatll break it laughs  marisha well why dont we weaken the 
none	 beams first  matt id say about three tons  travis what if we if we give ourselves away what do we lose a lot i dont think its worth it  sam lets drop a lets drop a giant bomb on him  marisha what do you mean  travis well well give away so if like we try and weaken and the metal makes any noise  anything right jigs up  marisha well its good jigs going to be up as soon as a giant  travis yeah at least its going through like we wont have 
none	 even gotten through  marisha but what if it doesnt bust all the way through until we start popping some of the beams  sam i dont i think dropping three tons on him is going have much more  travis and even if it doesnt it might be better than trying to crank it  marisha its a threeinchthick piece of pane and steel  taliesin im going to do would i have gotten enough engineering information about it to  actually have a good sense on whether or not three to five tons would actually  do anything 
none	 at this point  matt investigation check  taliesin another investigation 15  matt looking at the sections of the beams that youve damaged the thickness of the plane and the  metal bars the part where they attached youre not getting a full view cause youre not  actually looking in the room yet everyones avoided looking in the room at this point but you  gather with enough speed and enough weight this thing would break and hinge pretty easily  taliesin all right lets go for it im going to im just going to show where  
none	 i want him to drop  laura okay we bring him up  taliesin this is the point take him all the way up  marisha should i go ahead and heat the metal just in case for added stuff  i mean thats quiet  travis yeah why not wouldnt hurt  liam can i just say i have no idea whats about to happen but its been a great pleasure to walk  beside each and every one of you  travis are you doing the its been an honor to serve with you sir  marisha why 
none	 would you say that  taliesin screw you i want my final words with you to be indignant and irritated  orion i agree i think thats poppycock well be fine  taliesin well apologize later  sam all right whos flying the mouse up  laura tiberius me and you  orion yes come up  laura but were going to drop him as a full threeton weight  sam im polymorphing him ill make him drop  marisha we weakened only one side so hopefully itll only smash one side  travis itll just fall in it wont 
none	 go straight down  marisha maybe we can even try and aim him leaning towards our side more  laura well aim him towards the part that will break  orion just shoot him wherever we need him to drop and pfft  liam no we want him to be weight  laura and the three tons so we want him to be a giant when he falls  orion oh cause hes fat  laura exactly  travis shall we execute manhattan project  sam come on lets do this  laura fly it up  liam highpitched its 
none	 been an honor  sam on the carpet go do  we die with honor  matt so tiberius on the carpet  ashley i feel like im already just going to start crying  orion yes ill take the mouse  matt tiberius you take the mouse in your hand and for a second its adorable until the smell  hits you you all sit around the edge like keeping out of view you can see a little bit of  faint light coming through the glass  orion throw me the mouse  matt as the general green 
none	 glow that permeates the circumstance tiberius slowly lifts up  marisha i start heating the metal beams concentrating from both sides  matt okay as you get overhead tiberius you get the first look into this room  sam cages of bad guys  travis no experimentees  liam this is the suck  travis i think i just caked my pants a little bit  sam i think matt had things printed in a 3d printer for this so its pretty pretty cool  ashley we gotta get the prisoners to try and help us  taliesin theyre the 
none	 things weve been fighting  ashley theyre stitch monsters okay  liam well theyre a question mark  laura they might be controlledbykvarn stitch monsters  matt as you glance down inside you see immediately in the center of the room the giant  brass structure coming to a point above the elder brain in the center of the room on the elevated  platforms you see there are two caged sections of the room that contain two kind of flesh  skinless altered creatures that have been subjected to serious tortures by kvarn kvarn  floats off in the 
none	 distance by what looks like some sort of experimentation table containing glass  vials and strange metallic structures  orion dm which side has the crew worked on relative to where i am looking at  matt right here but first we are gonna go ahead and find  orion did they damage this side or this side  laura laughs we are so high up  ashley i dont i dont want to i just dont want to do it i am so scared  matt all right so everyone  ashley i have already died i know how 
none	 it feels  travis youre good  orion use the boots  sam i wont let you die pike  ashley and i wont let you guys die i am on it i am on it  liam i am going to try very hard not to die  taliesin die with hilarity or die not at all  matt well say the group is for the most part up here  orion not me i am chilling  matt there is a flying bear up here  sam thats a crazy roof party  orion so then theyve been 
none	 working on this side right  matt they are working on this side it would essentially hinge this way  orion this way wonderful  sam okay drop it drop it like its hot  matt as you glide up tiberius far above looking down into this  travis before it falls i would like to rage  matt all right is there any other preparatory spells that want to be cast at this moment you  wanna give inspiration to people do you wanna cast any spells  laura can i see him can i go ahead and cast

none	 you step back its a fivefoot space youre having to like lean and as you look back  like its a long slope  laura i crouch down  matt okay all right so kvarn starts kvarns turn kvarn now with like the poison coursing  through its body kind of just looks about and kind of shakes for a second the eye stalks kind  of looking in different directions and just goes laughs i want to play and begins to drift up  into the air  laura oh good he can fly  ashley i didnt know 
none	 that thats cool maybe we can get him out  matt kvarn moves up at which point you guys who were ducking down off to the side kvarn  comes into sight as he drifts up towards the top  travis sings shit shit shit  laura wheres like the thing that fell is it blocking any sort of  matt no its at this angle right here its basically kind of  following the temple ceiling there  sam we might have to get grog out of there somehow  matt so first things first its going to fire 
none	 its first ray  travis and it gets three eyes every turn  sam we need to run  matt all right so one of the eyes whips around it aims at lets see this would be at percy  percy go ahead and make a wisdom no this would be a dexterity saving throw  taliesin 24  matt 24 you manage to just duck out of the way as this kind of whitishgray beam of energy goes  tsch and shoots out from the top of the temple a secondary ray all right secondary ray is  going 
none	 to go ahead and fire at sighs pike  ashley me already i was at seven  laura its aiming at you  ashley youre aiming at sorry i just got so scared i heard my name  matt another beam of another beam shoots out go ahead and make a strength saving throw  ashley a strength saving throw  okay what would that what is that oh no okay i see 12  matt 12  sam you have inspiration should you need it  ashley oh okay  matt yeah you can add your inspiration dice to

none	 and  carried down into the chamber floating restrained unable to move and youre just kind  of floating in midair right there right now  ashley okay  matt and then the beam releases you go ahead and make an athletics check  marisha come on pike  matt with disadvantage cause youre in heavy mail  ashley okay nervous laugh what was it athletics a five  matt acrobatics technically sorry my fault  ashley oh four laughs  matt four all right  sam thanks for the clarification  matt all right you take 23 points of

none	 turn to stone  liam fuck  matt you manage to just pull out of the way of the blast thats going to end kvarns turn that  brings us to clarota  laura come on clarota  orion no clarota  matt lifts off to hover down into the other gets to about  liam what youve been waiting for clarota  matt well say for the purposes of this just for cause i dont have enough things to put up  here well say clarota eventually at his turn float from the bottom well say well say nearby 
none	  over here the face hes going to go into the mind blast okay as clarota lands next to it  grabs the side of its head and attempts to mind blast as a cone in front kvarn just turns and  laughs in clarotas face laughs your kind has tried so many times big old toothy grin pulls  across the front of the beholder that ends clarotas turn percy youre up  taliesin okay theres still a two questions theres still a stick floating in midair with a  rope tied to it correct  matt correct  
none	 taliesin thats fantastic i have a plan also ive been curious about targeting shot if i use  a drop targeting shot that wont work on him will it  matt oh the one that knocks him prone  taliesin the one that knocks flying targets down to the ground and then they fall  matt the wing shot i would say that would cause him to plummet a little bit  taliesin but it wouldnt do what it says i can do here where hes going to hit the ground  matt not necessarily due to the nature you 
none	 could lower his current position in the room but  his floating nature wouldnt allow him to necessarily take a lot of damage from that  taliesin i will hold off on that okay so i will just im going to do a targeted head shot  im going to grab the rope with my bonus action  matt all right  taliesin im pulling out  orion shoot the damn eye  taliesin oh yes im pulling out the bad news  matt okay  taliesin im going to take a shot basically take a targeted head shot at 
none	 him  matt okay  taliesin in the eye  matt okay  taliesin 29 i think that hits  matt will hit  taliesin all right so this does a couple things wheres my i know  where the hell are my  sam guys come on this is like piece of cake theres one guy theres like eight of us  matt the poison has worn off kvarn is still bleeding currently  so how many damage for that  taliesin its only ten points of damage but the nice thing that that does which is that for 
none	 the  rest of his turn up until the end of his turn he has disadvantage on all attacks  matt since the rays automatically hit ill consider that those who get hit by the rays will  have advantage on their saving throw  taliesin excellent im then going to take the rope holding on and im basically going to do a  swing so that im out of range for any of his attacks until my next attack  matt okay  taliesin im not swinging down into the temple im swinging around the outside of it so 
none	 that its  matt the outside over here okay well say youre over there  taliesin yeah  matt all right that ends your turn percy keyleth youre up  marisha oh its me this may okay how big of a jump is it from me to kvarn  matt id say at this distance its about a good 50 feet at an angle  marisha laughs im gonna do it fuck it  matt what are you doing  taliesin yolo  marisha yolo im going to run off the carpet and im going to do a swan dive

none	 clarota  comes to the ground and lands looks up the tentacles pull back brings one hand down and the  arcane sigils youve seen appear on the hands both light up and then releases a bolt of lightning  energy up into the air towards kvarn okay kvarn does make his dexterity saving throw takes  halfdamage on that that is 18 points of lightning damage and hes going to move back to  there at the end of clarotas turn legendary action hes going to use the secondary ray the  ray is going to be all right

none	 hit  liam okay thats a dagger into its butt three and theres no nonmagical effect on me at the  moment right cause im out of his vision so thats a nine  matt correct yep  liam just for damage okay  matt dagger slams into the bottom because youre out of the eye range returns to your side end of  your turn its going to use legendary action final ray  liam come sit on me dude come on down  matt all right this stalk now gives off this weird yellowish like a very faint 
none	 yellowish  seethrough color kind of scoops across the ground right past you after you throw the  dagger go ahead and roll a constitution saving throw  liam its able to i just dont know im not challenging it  matt it has stalks everywhere  liam even under on its tushie  matt these stalks aim down  liam oh i was going off that okay all right so what am i making at the  matt constitution saving throw  you have advantage because percy  liam advantage 18  matt 18 all right you manage to

none	 17 19  matt 19 damage all right it looks a little goopy the purpose of the tanglefoot bag usually  is to stick something to something like a creature on the ground  laura oh okay i didnt know that  matt so hes got goop on him doesnt seem to be affecting him much you wanna fire another arrow  laura oh i thought it was like a sort of wraparoundy arrow it wasnt like a i thought  it was like a  marisha like a bolo  laura yeah  taliesin it was a boloy thing 
none	  matt oh i thought this was the tanglefoot arrow  taliesin the tanglefoot was basically like a wire thing yeah it was a bolo arrow thats how it  that was how i originally pitched it was a bolo arrow  laura thats what he told me it was a long time ago  matt okay then given that circumstance the bolo wraps around him bolos  laura hopefully taking some of the stalks pinning it to his body  matt bolos are used to trap creatures legs when theyre running wrap around it  they kind of fall 
none	 over  laura right  matt it wraps around some of the eyestalks or parts and doesnt seem to have an additional  effect than the damage unfortunately its just bolo against beholder its kind of a square peg in  a hole  laura i know i was just hoping i could pin a stalk or two all right the second one with the  burning bow  matt all right  laura wasnt that the same thing as the first one oh no  liam i didnt see the second one 17  laura 15 24 okay so 
none	 ten 11 12 16 plus ten for the burning  matt okay  laura 19  matt all right gotcha cool as the arrow streaks and then slams into his side you see the  burst of flame begin to burn up its side and you can see now the armored plates on the side of  kvarn some are starting to like creak off and kind of peel off at the side the damage is  starting to have a visual impact on kvarn you can see theres bits of beholder blood  beginning to pour down the side 
none	 of its meatballlike torso  is that the end of your turn  laura and i duck down again and try to drop out of his view  matt that brings it to kvarns turn kvarn is going to attempt to shrug you off the horn grog  marisha hold on  matt first its going to fly up  travis oh great yeah thats good  marisha its going to fly up  travis i had to grab that thing  marisha can i move underneath so i can maybe catch grog from where i cheerleader  matt unfortunately

none	 the part of stone that raises up over the platform you unfortunately  you reduce the damage somewhat but you still end up taking 14 points of damage from the impact  taliesin okay  matt and you are prone that was kvarns movement now kvarn is going to go ahead and  fire three additional rays all right the kind of pinkishred ray streaks across and is going to  slam into you go ahead and make your saving throw  ashley shes all the way up there  matt its going to be a wisdom saving throw with 
none	 advantage  laura 21  matt 21 the beam comes across hits you in the shoulder kind of goes across the front of your  chest for a moment you feel this kind of bloodthirsty urge fill you and you just wince and  feel it wash over your body  travis oh thank god  matt all right the second ray reroll that all right the second one is going to go ahead and  streak down towards grog grog i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity check with ill say  disadvantage cause youre on

none	 next percy youre up  taliesin okay weird question laughs all right weve got a giant spiral machine hanging by  two chains right now  matt yes  taliesin im going to peek over the edge and is there a way that if i happen to snap one of those  chains that that thing would go slamming into him  matt very possible  taliesin im going to pull over and make that shot im going to steady myself sit down and  im going to make that shot  matt okay bad news aimed up youre aiming 
none	 youre probably going to have to move around to  this side  taliesin fine  matt which is very careful around the two of them oh actually  youd probably go around this side  taliesin i go around the other way  matt yeah so you make your way to here you kneel down with the bad news you aim for one of  the weak points of the metal bent and ruined from the swinging of the platform you grabbed that  horn grog  taliesin 17  matt 17 does not hit  taliesin does not 
none	 hit a notmoving target  matt oh no no i was thinking of his ac that hits the platform im so dumb  taliesin so thank you  matt yes that does hit go ahead and roll damage  taliesin seven eight nine ten 15 points of damage  matt 15 points of damage go ahead and make a constitution save as the blast of the bad news  threatens to push you back  taliesin 20  matt keeping your low stance you keep yourself with strain on the top the blast hits the side  of the metal 
none	 the metal streaks and breaks and snaps the single bit of the contraption swings  widely slamming into the side of kvarn kvarn does not make his dexterity saving throw  taliesin yes  orion very good  matt kvarn takes 36 points of damage the blast of the arcane nature of the contraption and the  impact from it slams into him pushing him all the way to the side over here so leaving you  right where you were there and you can see now part of the metal armor has completely been  destroyed by the impact 
none	 so the ac actually lowers for kvarn and hes looking pretty rough  taliesin cool bonus action im shooting him again  matt oh you mean the action surge  taliesin action surge  matt okay cause you used your second attack to reload  taliesin yeah well i used my second attack to reload now im on my yeah  matt you unfortunately from your position since it slammed in this direction you dont have  eyesight on him unless hes considered having cover right now  taliesin have i actually moved all six of my all six of

none	 marisha vox machina  matt another ray of energy it glances up at you just in time for you to release that final arrow  it strikes down going right into the pupil the light blue color immediately bursts into an angry  red as the eye closes over trying to contain the impact the blood begins to pour out of the front  of the eye as the arrow you can see pierce out the back side and is jutting about six inches out  the back of the beholder and kvarn slowly sinks a few feet and just 
none	 slams onto the ground  travis fuck you meatball  cheering  travis vex  taliesin that is how its done  matt that ends your turn vex  laura and i hug trinket so tight  matt okay so on kvarns turn black energy begins to pull into the horn and the beholder  opens the eye again now the light blue color is just a pale white and you can see the jaws a  little slack but the horn is now glowing this intense black color and the beholder gets back up  from his position  
none	 laura ugh hes zombie beholder now  matt at which kimas on the ground says shit orcus god of undeath of course and shes going  to start getting ready on her end  liam evil god  laura oh my god is this like another boss  marisha the horn was from orcus hes not a demigod  liam just two more hours we got this  matt kvarns going to take another ray attack at lets see so a dexterity save against this  would be kima on the ground kima fails kimas form begins to slowly turn

dung	 and as it streaks to the inside it bursts from the  interior you see ice shards piercing it from the inside out as the form kind of lands on the  ground there as ice begins to slowly form and crackle around its outside you can still see dark  energy pulling into the horn  orion wonderful while i no i spend five sorcerer points and i do telekinesis and rip the  horn off his fucking  matt how many sorcery points do you have  orion thats it after that  marisha why not i can
