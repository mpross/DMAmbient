none	 tonights episode of critical role  dramatic music  matt and welcome back so picking up where we left off vox machina in their journey to destroy  the chroma conclave a gathering of chromatic dragons that have torn through the taldorei  countryside and taken up residence and calling it their domain theyve defeated umbrasyl they have  their sights set on the next series of dragons in the process of setting up a timeline in which they  had to bait the white dragon vorugal in the ravine outside of the ruins of draconia hopefully to  jump 
none	 on and destroy the dragon  they were approached in whitestone by an individual that apparently was not seeker assum  an ally of theirs from long ago instead it was one of the dragons of the conclave raishan the  green dragon who had come to parley and actually offer an alliance seemingly unhappy with the  current set of rules and lack of interest from thordak in making up his side of the bargain which  was struck raishan has asked for your aid in destroying the swollen dangerous red dragon you  guys asked as a showing 
none	 of faith to have raishan come with you to the ruins of draconia gather the  ravenites and destroy vorugal alongside you as such you gathered lady kima as an ally in this  endeavor you transported yourselves to the snow and icecovered ravine just now have taken up in  scanlans magnificent mansion and are laying down for an evenings rest so as you guys wake up the  next morning or before you do  laura no  sam and marisha we dont sleep  laura no  sam whyre you waking me up  laura because i 
none	 was thinking maybe its a bad idea to go jumping into this tomorrow dont you  think maybe we should wait a day  sam sure  laura i mean we could watch vorugal see whats going on see what his behavior is and also  prepare a little bit more with the ravenites but that happening you might have to inform them that  hes not actually going to have a  sam an attack  laura tomorrow  sam but we literally just got back from telling them to be ready to move tomorrow morning  laura i 
none	 know  marisha percy how are you feeling you know he seems all right  laura no he would have extra day to recover percys not himself yet  taliesin i am sleeping in the corner i would assume  travis he does look a little weak even for his standards  marisha a little pale  laura i just dont think its the best idea to jump into this  travis burps loudly  sam so we have to go back and tell them  liam literally just got back  sam and they were pissed they were super 
none	 pissed that we were there we could go back  laura do you go back in the morning or do you go back now  marisha i feel like time is of the essence here probably not best to wait until morning  sam tooma is not going to be pleased  marisha look she already hates us  sam thats true  travis yeah cant get any worse  liam it could  travis what were freeing them from a dragon we are bearers of good tidings  marisha are we  travis yeah  marisha groans  travis 
none	 now do we totally trust tooma and the ravenites do we want to give her all the details  or just that were going to be checking it out for one day more before we ring the dinner bell  sam what are the details  travis well if we have an extra day what does that get us  marisha we can maybe try and get pike  travis ooh  marisha gives us an extra day for pike  travis how do we do that  sam i dont know  marisha i can go get her theoretically 
none	 if we have an extra day  travis which i think we do but i think we need you here right  marisha she does have the stone right she does have the stone i think she has the stone  laura yeah she has the stone  marisha okay  travis were going to be setting a trap right  laura yes  travis so maybe we make that trap more better  laura what exactly did you tell tooma was going to happen  sam be ready to attack tomorrow morning were going to deliver a giant beast 
none	 for the dragon to  hunt and that her people should be ready to strike thats it  laura did you tell her to tell vorugal anything in particular  liam no but we dont know if she has or not theyve got their necks on the line i know  theyre not to be trusted but theyre in a precarious position as well  marisha well we dont want to necessarily have them jump in right away we want them to set  vorugal on yenk correct  laura yes shouldnt she inform vorugal that the monster is coming 
none	  marisha glorified messengers at this point  travis whos yenk  laura the big monster that were setting for him  marisha the goristro  travis whats that hes like a ram  laura yeah a giant ram havent you seen the picture did you see the picture  travis no im the only one that really appreciates pictures and i havent seen it  marisha oh thats unfortunate  laura ill go grab the book from percy as hes sleeping  taliesin roll for it  sam you dont get to say roll  laura you dont get

none	 and scanlan when youre within did you see vorugal in your travels  sam no we kept out of sight in the caverns and vorugal we dont think saw us but we also didnt  see vorugal either  travis do you think you could replicate your path in the daylight  laura i think he would see them what if you became a fly or something and flew down would he  notice you  sam wouldnt see me i dont want to speak for vax but if were going back tonight you no  longer have the ability 
none	 to fly is that true but you do vexy  laura i do and i can speak draconic  sam oh yeah well that wouldve been helpful last time actually  laura sorry i didnt think about that last time  sam but yes if i were a fly i assume any of us can avoid his detection if we stay low and  invisible well yes  laura all right  sam right  laura can you make me invisible  marisha i cant he can  sam i can make you invisible  travis are we going to

none	 you scanlan  sam i feel nothing sometimes i have to hold it with my left hand so it feels different  marisha i switch hands  laughter  marisha still nothing  travis when you call it the stranger  matt so as you cast pass without a trace on yourself and scanlan the shadows of the mansion  cling to you a little darker a little more crushed you wish to cast invisibility on vex you said  sam yes i will use yet another 3rdlevel invisibility spell to make us both invisible  matt all right you 
none	 both jump onto the back of her broom  laura okay  matt and just to double check here  travis the way he said that  laura no he said it really terribly  matt what do you mean i didnt say anything  travis you sure did  laura sure did  matt ill say technically youre carrying the broom so the broom will also be invisible okay  so as youre holding the broom you both leap onto it the two of you and the broom vanish and you  guys are free to exit the mansion 
none	 at your disposal  sam yeah so we made a right here and left here and right at the big rock  laura is anybody going to keep track of us like you kept track of vex vax i just called my  brother me i just did that  sam vex is the girl one vax is the boy  laura is somebody going to be around in case something goes horribly wrong  liam ill go with you if kiki wants to turn me into a crow or a fly or something ill stay back  and watch 
none	  laura stay up like kiki did before  marisha i mean i could do what i did before and follow you as minxie worked last time i still  have my one last shape as well  sam isnt minxie big and spottable  marisha its a mountainbased tiger im a white snow tiger  sam thats so hot  marisha its actually very cold in the mountains thats why they have thick coats  travis you dont think vorugal is going to think thats a midnight snack  marisha who me  travis yeah you big white tiger 
none	  marisha he didnt see me before  travis oh okay  marisha let me see something hang on because thisll tell me because polymorph you might go  out of my range is the only problem  sam polymorph just lasts wait no  matt nope concentration  sam so he has to stay within range  marisha range is 60 feet  matt no thats just to cast it im pretty sure he can go off on his own as long as you maintain  concentration  marisha okay can i he can go do you want to 
none	 go all right what do you want to be  liam something white  laura something very small like a moth a white moth  sam its got to be something that can go as fast as were going  laura he can sit on my shoulder no  liam yeah but then if you guys get fucked im dead as well  laura ill just smack you and then youll become you again  liam so itll just be like every day all right yeah  marisha its true  laura right if i smack him its not going 
none	 to kill him he just turns back into  sam if he were a black crow or something he could fly back on its own a moth cant travel a mile  laura make him a white crow  liam yeah can you make me an albino crow  marisha sure i dont see why not  sam with one yellow eye and one black eye  travis oh get on with it fuckers  laughter  marisha i do that with one yellow eye and one black eye  matt all right and as your form shifts to the 
none	 first probably albino crow to wander the landscape  here in wildemount you are able to follow them should you so chose  marisha to match vex i give him one little blue feather just off the side little blue streak  liam a little bit this isnt percys but caws  laughter  taliesin caws  laura come on lets go come on  sam all right lets go  matt you guys make your way outside into the heavy snowfall across the top of the ravine you  go ahead and make a survival check to try and 
none	 follow the tracks of minxie to the outskirts of  where you guys were last time  sam do i also get to give her any assistance like we went this way go that way  matt yeah you know what giving you the assist go ahead and roll with advantage on that  travis oh thats lucky  sam dice jail already  laura yeah definitely already 17  matt okay takes you a little bit of time but you manage to find your way back through the heavy  snowfall its freezing cold and your teeth are starting 
dung	 to chatter a little bit but you manage  to make your way to the top of the ravine dipping down where you find the cavern entrance at the  bottom leading into where tooma and rest of the ravenites at least seem to have the central  portion of their society within the mountain itself you guys come down its a little warmer  the further into the rock you travel the snow turns to slush then to damp ground to dry rock  and stone  laura i get off the broom and put it behind me  
none	 matt okay both still walking invisibly with you now whoosh walking behind them hopping as the  white crow  sam we should do the same thing we did last time i know you werent here we turned visible asked  to guards to go its going to be really shitty when we get in there because shes going to hate us  laura all right ow fuck you stop it  sam i will drop invisibility are the guards around  matt you guys are just on the outskirts of the entranceway  sam oh well stay invisible until 
town	 we get to the guards  matt to the center of the town or outside of toomas  laura oh i thought we were already in the cave  matt youre inside the cave theres a path in there and it opens up into the actual subterranean  village and then in there across from this fountain area is where toomas tent is  sam where did we meet the guards last time  matt as soon as you entered the main village area  sam thats where we want to meet them again  matt so as you both 
none	 drop your invisibility guise with your white crow friend hopping behind you  the same two guards are still patrolling only one of them notices you turns around and gives an odd  look his head cocked to the side as he grabs his spear and puts it towards you again  sam yep same routine well leave our weapons here this is my friend vex wed like to see  tooma again i know its very upsetting that we have to make these night calls like this but its  very important  laura i speak in draconic i 
none	 say sorry my friend rambles  liam hacking spit  laura my broom takes off behind me  matt yeah exactly vanishes forever keeping the spear there yells out foreign word and the  other soldier whos wandering turns around looks and sees steps over puts his spear down and they  both have a conversation briefly you can as i recall speak draconic and can read lips is that  what it was yeah theyre both discussing why these stupid people keep coming back and bothering  tooma as well as the coming tension of tomorrows activities and how 
town	 they cant keep interrupting  tooma if shes going to be keeping her mind straight but one of them leaves the other one  steps circles around and begins nudging you both forward telling you in draconic  then go make it quick  laura we will  matt as you guys stay at the outskirts of toomas tent the interior light has been sufficiently  dimmed as it was before with a little bit of the embers that are still there in the fire pit in the  center now barely cracking ember tooma is passed out and curled 
none	 up inside her thronelike  chair as one of the other dragonborn soldiers comes over and nudges her gently tooma they  return she rakes towards his face he barely ducks out of the way unnatural speed for a  creature as old as she is per se but then the hand recoils back with a snapping sound and she  wakes up you come again  sam yes we offer profound apologies for waking you from your slumber again  matt snaps her arm back into place cracking  laura in draconic we apologize for waking you up unfortunately 
town	 i sent my brother here before  with our compatriot and he spoke out of turn were actually planning the attack the day after  tomorrow  matt sigh foreign words which you recognize as tell the others wait a day and one of her  servants wanders off behind you guys and exits the tent she turns back to you  then what is to be done  laura well be releasing a very large fiend  sam at the spot where you told us  matt at the stones yes  laura the stones we hope that you 
none	 will inform vorugal that its going to happen hell head over  fightfightfight he becomes much weaker we jump in fightfightfight  matt itll be done do not mess this up  sam question before we go typically when youve done this in the past you inform vorugal and he  heads on over right away does he need to see evidence of a hunt how does it work do you  typically inform him  matt i do not inform skork does the informing  sam skork  laura yes skork i remember him  sam and is there 
none	 some sort of hunt horn or anything that signals the beginning of this or  does it just happen  matt depending on where the prey is whether it be nearby forests or presented in chains to the cinder  stones of which ive sent you vorugal begins the chase  laura he wont be in chains exactly is that all right  matt just keep it there  laura oh okay  sam i dont want to mess this up if vorugal were to see anyone near this summoning circle would he  be suspicious or would he be 
none	 okay with it  matt if it is not a ravenite it would probably make them part of the hunt  sam okay good to know  laura good news good great  matt is that all  laura thats all be pleased we will see you in a couple of days  sam theres like a 5050 chance well come back again tonight  laura no its not were not  sam no 6040  laura lets just go  sam were out of here  matt leave me  sam sorry  laura again i apologize for my 
none	 brother hes an idiot  matt she doesnt even pay you guys any mind just curls over takes her heavy robes and like wraps  them around her and curls up into a small little bundle of old dragonborn woman the rest of the  soldiers close in cutting you off from her and they all give you the very stern look that you  have seen many times that tells you get the fuck out  laura okay you make us invisible  sam oh yeah invisibility yet again im out of 3rdlevel spells  laura is pass without 
none	 a trace still active on us its up to an hour  matt yeah itd still be active  liam as theyre leaving not wanting to get left out i fly down from the air and land in my sisters  hair and like a cat growls into the top of her head five or seven or 12 times  laura thank you  liam caws  marisha so tangled  matt instantaneous bedhead you cant even see it but you can feel it and it bothers you all  right you guys both are invisible the bird clutching to 
none	 your side you take the broom back up  into the snowy storm i need you both to make stealth checks with advantage  laura i thought we were invisible were invisible  sam yes ive made us invisible again  liam big bonus  laura okay stealth checks  sam with advantage  laura plus ten to whatever you roll  sam oh snap 12 22  laura 36  sam 24  matt all right you guys make your way up out of the ravine up onto the top of the snowy banks at  the top of 
none	 where the cliffsides are eventually over the next 20 or so minutes finding the  shimmering outskirts of scanlans doorway joining the rest of the party  laura get the fuck off my head you piece of shit  matt polymorph lasts for how long  marisha an hour  matt as soon as you get to the top of ravine the white crow impact facedown in the snow  marisha i think its an hour  liam speaking of which hold still theres a little bit of bird shit right there  laura aw i thought you were serious 
none	  liam sorry  matt thankfully that doesnt transform either  laughter  matt you make your way back into scanlans mansion  marisha while they were gone i with fenthras and whisper was playing makebelieve archer vex like  a 12yearold in the bedroom with a nerf bow  matt as you enter the front of scanlans mansion you see keyleth in the corner whos pulled  whisper back in fenthras and it goes dagger impact into the wall  marisha it worked how did it go guys  laura give me the bow right now  travis oh 
dung	 busted  marisha it might be like a cool combo move  laura ill think about it thank you  travis she take it well  laura she did she said shed wait  sam shes a night person shes okay  travis great  laura yeah  matt you did catch on the way up vex that even through the dark sleetcovered snow blaring night  there is the faint hint of light blue sunrise in the distance  laura oh shit days coming we didnt sleep we need to sleep  travis wait should we see if we 
none	 can get pike first  sam first do we have any spells to do that  marisha i can try and scry  laura what if you take the stone pop over to her then use tree stride and come back  marisha that i can do yeah  sam you have another tree stride in you didnt we get here today  marisha we did but if i burn a higherlevel spell then yeah what does it matter  at this point  travis yeah lets get all our ducks in a row  marisha all right ill be 
none	 right back see you guys in a minute  liam bye a minute passes  marisha a minute passes this is like when you walk the same direction you say bye and then you  walk the same direction to the car  matt awkward quiet you hear kima snoring with her back against the foyer wall just snoring  until eventually the stone begins to glow and pulse like a dull frozen heartbeat pulsing keyleth  your eyes open and you see it flashing in your hands again and you look up real fast and before  you can 
none	 say anything your mouth opens to say goodbye before she vanishes in a swirl of glitter  and blue light  laura oh shit  matt now pike come sit down  cheering  ashley hello  marisha i like your jacket its really great  ashley oh hi okay  matt just flew in  ashley yeah here we go  laughter  matt so as the day has gone by and through the chaos of getting whitestone ready trying to  assemble the followers of sarenrae that youve gathered and protecting the remnants of the city  as 
dung	 vox machina went off a moment hits you and you close your eyes and pray to sarenrae and hope that  all shall be well with your friends and you wish that you could be there to help them and theres a  sudden warmth in your proximity and then a sudden flash of blue light and then nearby you see a  somewhat cold damp keyleth just appear in the space next to you as youre preparing to lay  yourself down for an evenings rest it being later at night now clutching the stone  ashley hey i 
none	 was just about to go to bed  marisha were you sleeping this is so awkward  ashley i was just saying my prayers  marisha oh my gosh  ashley i do it as much as i can  marisha you know i never thought about having poor timing with these gate stones im so sorry  ashley stammers  marisha i thought you were on the toilet  ashley i know im so glad i wasnt  marisha yeah me too  ashley im so glad youre here  marisha i missed you  ashley i missed you 
none	  sam we saw her literally today  marisha yeah but it seems like i went around the world and back  ashley i was thinking today and i was like oh man i shouldve just gone with them  marisha yeah we got all the way there and we were like oh we forgot pike  ashley i know its okay  marisha do you want to go  ashley or i will be there now lets go  marisha we can go now  ashley lets do it  marisha all right  sam is that a new

none	 the sun tree  marisha right so yeah so the leader of ravenites her name is tooma and we went there  and we were talking to her and i think we have a plan but not really a plan so were going to  figure it out as we go all right lets go thats the plan youre caught up  ashley okay great hey guys  laughter  matt so as the spell finishes the sun tree opens you step through the portal into the slow  crawling sunrise the sun hasnt quite crested but you can see 
none	 through the snowfall which is  lessening at the moment the distant light blue is getting lighter and lighter you probably have  another 30 minutes before the sun hits the actual horizon line but as you step out of one of the  trees that you created previous when you had journeyed to the ruins of draconia you do see  about 150 feet off the shimmer of the outside of scanlans mansion door  marisha whispers lets be quiet okay lets do this  sam oh great pikes good at quiet  marisha we stealth there  matt 
none	 both you guys roll stealth checks  sam oh jesus  liam this is so great now we can all die together  matt you have disadvantage pike  marisha oh thats a natural one  sam wait what  ashley i dont think i can get worse than that that is a one  sam and matt two natural ones  marisha no  sam oh my god the dragons going to fucking kill us right now  marisha oh my god pike the plan hasnt even started  laura dice jail  liam were all about to lie 
none	 down for a threehour nap what are you talking about  ashley off to a great start  matt as you guys begin stepping through the snow pike you take a step and you hear this strange  cracking sound and you feel this slight shift beneath your feet and you watch as some snow  begins to trickle off the side of the cliffside  marisha pike  ashley im going to not move  marisha i dont move either do we not move or do we run  ashley we should run we should run because its probably 
none	 coming down  marisha run  laughter  matt as soon as you both push off running whoosh a portion of the cliff actually shears  off and begins to slide down the side pike if you could go ahead and roll a dexterity saving  throw real fast  laura oh my god matt why are you trying to kill her right when she gets here  sam yeah matt why did you roll two natural ones  ashley wait what did you say it is  travis and matt a dexterity saving throw  ashley wait i get 
none	 nothing okay a four  matt a four you begin to see pike slide down off the edge  marisha i cast grasping vine to grab onto her  matt with that some of the reeds some of the nearby frozen plants on the edge that were largely  covered with snow that were revealed as the rest of the snow began to crumble off a large vine  shoots out wraps around you and pulls you back up onto the side of the cliff fine the rest of  the rock and snow and ice you hear crashing clattering 
none	 into the ravine below  ashley and marisha go  matt all right you guys run you see the doorway shimmering before you you get closer and you  hear in the distance this strangely familiar distant echoing growls  ashley aw come on what is that noise  marisha go run  matt you both just get to the doorway in time the snowfalls still there though gentler than it  was in the night you both dart inside slamming the mansion door behind you into a warmer  comfortable quieter atmosphere panting  ashley hey  laura what 
none	 just happened  liam jeepers  travis hey  ashley hey  travis hey buddy why are you out of breath  liam you all right you look white as a ghost  taliesin have i had a full nights sleep at this point  matt no not yet  taliesin goddamn it  marisha dragon might know were here  travis what why  marisha well there mightve been a rockslide and it mightve been our fault im not sure  travis you just walked through a tree why was there a rockslide  marisha i dont know grog 
none	  liam the door is easy to see  sam the door is shimmery and shiny  matt no nobody can see through it  marisha they can see a shimmering door  matt only if you let them only individuals that you choose can see the entrance  laura thats great  ashley so whatever that was just saw us disappear  laura oh shit grog open the door dust of tracelessness out the door right now  travis oh yeah i open the front door and i take big handful of the dust of tracelessness and i  
none	 whack  matt okay make a strength check theres a mild wind here youre fighting against with dust so  well see  travis 14  matt 14 okay you take a big old heaping handful and whoosh another one as you send it out  there all the snow crusts over and any signs of footprints both halfelf or gnomish turn into a  gentle untouched solid surface of snow as you begin to hear in the distance another echoing  growl  travis and ashley what is that  laura and sam close the door  laura close 
none	 the door grog  travis i just want to see what it is  ashley i slam it shut with my gauntlets  travis hey pushy  ashley we dont know what that was well maybe you do but i dont know  marisha im assuming that was vorugal  sam the dragon  travis its a dragon  ashley its a dragon  travis yeah a big white dragon  marisha big white big dummy dragon  travis and you let it know were here chuckles  ashley well that was an accident i was going to surprise you 
none	 guys and we almost died  travis but hey were not so we need to get some sleep right  sam yes everyone sleep now  travis we sleep  matt okay you guys all go to rest  travis yes  matt all right a full rest is taken for all of you everyones healed back to full spells are  recovered percy you are now down to a minus two i believe penalty to your rolls  liam wake up and its two in the afternoon  matt technically yeah its midafternoon by the time you guys finish 
dung	 your full rest except for  percy percy is up before everybody else and is pacing about the mansion by himself probably  sam the mansion will last 24 hours so itll be dark again by the time it wears off so we can  stay in here as long as we need to  liam all right  sam but do we have things we need to accomplish today  taliesin how about making a quiet cavern not too far away from the summoning circle where we can hide  laura that might be smart actually  marisha at 
none	 the pace in which that cliff fell apart last night i dont know about the structure  of the topography here  taliesin thats fair  laura but were also up high and the ravine is down low that could make a difference  liam yeah we could get piled on  laura oh i understand  sam but with percivals engineering skills he could maybe find a good little spot of granite for  you to dig into or something  marisha i can try and do a commune with nature and see  travis these islands float right 
none	  matt oh they once did all the islands of draconia were disabled the arcane essence that  let them stay up and they all crashed into the ravine  liam also when shit goes down we dont want to repeat the mistakes of the past a we dont want  to teleport inside the dragons belly  sam im keeping all options on the table  travis only stupid people do that  liam clearly b we dont all want to be all grouped together  laura we dont want that  liam im eating one of these magic 
none	 candies  laura those chicken candies  liam yes theres chicken we want to spread out so were not all blasted at the same time  taliesin vex and i at a distance  liam separately though so you can hit from different angles  travis so two caves four caves  marisha ill have to think on the caves  sam they dont have to be giant caverns its just a little nook a little foxhole  liam cubbyholes up high for anyone who can take to the air down low for anyone who cant  marisha honestly im 
none	 not going to know a whole lot until we scout out the location  taliesin lets go scout out the location  sam okay how do we do that in broad daylight  marisha ive got something ive never done before  laura what is this  sam its called invisible reconnaissance  marisha almost its called animal shapes and its basically polymorph but for all of us i can  turn us all into whatever we want  laura so we dont just look like cows  laura and marisha we are cows  travis quick question in all 
none	 of our time here when we were scouting before and when you two  jokers were going to go see tooma did we see a bunch of animals around  laura i have not seen very many animals i dont think  matt within the ravine theres been very few what animals you have seen have been a few flying  owls other carnivorous birds that are generally scavengers youve seen maybe a few small wolves  that are picking through the ruins and eventually scattered off white snow wolves  travis as long as being animals isnt going to 
none	 make us a midday snack versus being ravenites  sam i will say this i love the sound of this spell but wouldnt travelling mist be really  undetectable could we mist around  marisha its almost debatable because we look like an unnatural mist  sam theres a snowstorm out there were just going to be one with the clouds  laura is there a snowstorm  matt if you guys glance outside of the mansion and look it is not a snowstorm but there are  heavy winds wind blowing you can hear multitudes a cacophony of offharmonies 
dung	 of winds  of different portions of the distant ravine that are all howling together there is a faint  snowfall but the clouds are dark and heavy and more of a storm coming your way  laura does snow get thrown up to the wind  matt a little further down in the ravine it does  liam and as long as were not synchronized swimming in mist form and spread out then it  should be fine  laura behave like wind you guys  travis can we do both animals and the mist  matt no they 
none	 both require concentration  sam my worry about animals is dont we also have the intellect of the animals that we become  matt actually wind walk is not concentration in theory you could do both wind walk is not  concentration  marisha we can be misty animals  matt you can be misty animals  marisha thats dumb  laughter  marisha thats a lot  sam so we keep our own intellect  marisha we always keep our intellect animal shapes last for 24 hours  taliesin can you go back and forth  marisha im going 
none	 to find that out right now  taliesin thats a question  marisha because if we were a flock of birds vorugals not going to give a shit about birds  sam a flock of hawks they dont go together but a flock of pigeons do or a flock of geese  taliesin i dont want to be food i want to be something that eats  liam while theyre debating i pull whisper out and i chuck it into a wall and teleport to it i  pulled it out of the blinkback belt  matt yeah so you 
dung	 chuck the dagger as youre talking you watch as vax takes the blade flings  it across the room it slams into the side of the foyer you look back to where he was and hes not  there anymore theres a flash of dark shadow energy where the blade is and vaxs form appears  right there holding the blade where it landed in the wall  laura that is so cool  liam it didnt go into my belt i went into the wall and im holding it still i was a shadow  for half a second 
dung	 and i traveled with the blade i am fucking nightcrawler holy shit and i throw  it again across the other side  matt okay this time make an attack roll because youre excited not concentrating  liam okay sure thats 27  matt yeah it goes a little more elevated lands about ten feet up as it impacts you guys watch  as he releases the blade his form almost is pulled along almost like its caught on a tether  and then just turns into dark smoke and vanishes with the blade as the blade sticks into the 
none	 wall  he reappears at the side clutching the edge and you drop a few feet and land onto your feet  liam aw suck it haters this is the coolest dagger ive ever had  sam tell me this can you not do that if you throw it and dont want to travel where it is  liam i throw it right next to his head and i dont go anywhere  matt roll an attack roll  sam go right in my neck  liam 24  matt 24 dagger impact right next to him  liam does 
none	 it go to my belt  matt it returns to your belt  sam oh you get to choose  marisha that is awesome  sam maybe dont ever do that again please  laura sure youre okay grog that you dont have the dagger i know you wanted it  travis i just want to be able to move faster but its all right  liam we cant all be all things grog you are the strongest thing on the planet you are going  to take vorugal all by yourself  travis yeah if i can get next 
none	 to him  laura which he probably cant  liam you shut the fuck up you troublemaker you bust my balls on a daily basis what is that  about what is that about what have i ever done but support you  travis pipe down calm down listen how are we getting down there can we hurry this up please  liam throw my dagger at the ceiling travel with it  matt all right so you watch his form vanish again about 40 feet up impact  liam can i land on my sister  laura on me 
none	  matt make a dexterity saving throw this would be acrobatics right  laura what about me  matt make a perception check  laura i was looking straight at him  liam i rolled a 27  laura perception 20  matt you make a dexterity saving throw  laura sighs you piece of shit  liam quit starting with me  laura dexterity 28 30  liam 30 she beat me  matt she dodges right out of the way and you slam onto the ground you feel your ankles and  knees ping a little bit that 
none	 sharp pain hits you in both joints and youre like moans  liam worth it groans  marisha so anyway back to the plan  laughter  marisha so with animal shapes i can actually decide what animals each of you can be so we can  all be different animals furthermore on my action i can use it to transform you guys into a  different creature  laura thats pretty cool  liam i like how excited you are about this  marisha im so excited  laura im wondering if the mist form would not be better 
none	 but the animals are really cool  taliesin can we go in and out of mist form thats a thing we can do  sam it takes a while but yes  liam but were not in the middle of a fight hopefully the animals kiki save it for a rainy day  marisha all right  laura if were not all dead come tomorrow  liam yeah we probably all will be dead tomorrow but its a really cool idea  marisha thank you for your validation  sam two questions are we all going and question two when 
none	 we get there and find a suitable  location for carving caves are you going to do this right now or are we just scouting  taliesin were going to do this as well  sam were going to do this right now  marisha i imagine it depends on how scouting goes  sam well we cant communicate when were in mist form so you just have to go do if you feel it  laura maybe scout and then go back because mist form stays for eight hours so at least that way  we can communicate not 
none	 next to vorugal  taliesin if we scout and its clear and then we come back and then go back it might not be clear  again if we scout and its clear then we do it its done  matt you guys hear this faint gargling sound as grog is currently gargling his own spit and  staring at the ceiling  liam i didnt follow that either we should do something  marisha all right lets go scout i cast wind walk on everybody  matt okay all of you begin to feel your form buzz a little 
none	 bit with the instilled power of  wind as you all each step out onto the snow on the outside of the mansion you can concentrate  for a moment as your form then meshes into a mistlike billowing cloud  laura do we look natural  sam yeah what do we look like  laura do we look pretty obvious  sam are we a yellow cloud a white cloud  matt id say its more of a whitish cloud i wouldnt say its supremely obvious right now but  the wind is pushing you about a little bit 
none	 if you try and focus direction of move you can get a  better idea how well your movement is  taliesin im trying to move in a very windy way yeah  travis and kima is with us  matt kima is with you yeah  liam and taliesin i am the fart  matt kima as you guys are doing this and it gets cast kima goes so what am i doing  marisha do you want to come scout were going to scout or you can just stay  matt you know im going to stay youve 
none	 got a big kitchen here  marisha its mainly filled with chicken  matt i love chicken  laughter  travis theres also a training room several levels down if you want to go smash some shit  matt im going to get some chicken and im going to go smash some shit  marisha and theres the spa under that  matt i dont think ive been to a spa does that also have chicken  laura it could if you wanted it to  ashley you could bring it down there  matt this is the best place 
none	 ever  sam it is it really is  matt come back when you need me she goes and runs off to the kitchen area all right you guys  stepping out keeping the focus on the spell you move halfspeed through this weather in mist form  so your 300 feet per round speed whatever it is is reduced to a mere 150 feet  marisha its okay its more for appearance  matt what are you guys doing are you coasting through the ravine are you heading directly or  trying to go overhead  marisha i want 
town	 to go to the summoning stone im going towards there  sam but we discussed before we left that we would mainly stick to the lowlands and the ravine to get  there yeah  laura yes we did  taliesin hugging the walls looking normal  marisha sure i follow the crowd  matt okay whos leading  ashley i am  laughter  laura ill lead the way  liam this is the quietest youve ever been  taliesin i volunteer as tribute  sam shouldnt laura lead  taliesin let laura lead  matt okay so vex 
none	 and pike are leading the way  ashley no i was kidding  taliesin too late no takebacks  travis we all die together  matt as you guys slowly drift down into the bottom of the ravine on the outside of where the  mansion doorway is you crest down to where a large portion of the rubble is currently buried by  snow and ice the wind is whipping snow up into the air and youre finding little spirals and  little snow devils that are making their way through as different clusters of wind tend to  
none	 swell and subside you make your way over to the opposite side of the ravine and start heading to  the north way crawling around  laura im going to keep an eye out to make sure nobody seems like theyre especially towards  vorugals plateau to make sure hes not there  matt need you to go ahead and make a perception check if you could and i need everybody to make a  stealth check please  marisha do we get some sort of bonus because were mist  laura perception is 30  marisha jesus  ashley 
none	 how can you be loud as mist  liam natural 20  marisha stealth and what  taliesin just stealth for us  sam do i get to add jack of all  matt you can as long as youre not trained in it you can add it to it  sam im not okay 18  taliesin 16  marisha 14  matt 20  laura 15  ashley eight  travis four  matt okay its fine its a group check so successes outweigh the failures you guys as a  group begin to move forward its fine 
none	 as you guys are slowly moving your way you keep an eye  out you can see there are some ravenites in clusters that are out currently poring through  the rubble there are crews that are basically excavating trying to pull out whats worth  anything from the remnants of draconia  you make your way around this large familiar curvature from before that leads towards the  center area of vorugals nowclaimed lair at the bottom of the ravine as you turn the corner and  you guys keep watch you can see on the icy platform with 
none	 these spikes that jut out at  various places throughout this larger central area here on top you can see perched and curled up  the massive form of the white dragon itself claws curled up under its chin its chin slightly turned  askew to the left eyes closed wings wrapped up around and gently flapping over the sides of the  top of this icy platform it sits there quietly breathing in and you can hear the breath itself  deep and guttural just echoing snoring the wind occasionally sneaks in and seems to almost  carry the 
none	 echo farther than it should be audible and you can see there are two packs of about five  ravenites that are armed and are sitting at the base of the platform that are looking out some  of them are sitting some of them are eating some small rations some are just keeping an eye out  these appear to be essentially assigned guards to vorugal here at his lair so you guys continue past  taliesin oh yes  matt heading which direction  laura towards the summoning circle  matt you recall which direction that was  
none	 liam its east  matt all right so you head a little northward following the curvature of this part of the ravine  in an eastward direction eventually you all move past an uncomfortable proximity of about 200 to  300 feet of vorugal seemingly not catching anyones attention as you slowly move following  the pattern of winds it takes you a little longer to get through but you figure its best to look  as natural as possible with the moving terrain and weather  eventually you turn around and begin making your way eastward away following where 
none	 two more  portions of the ravine clump together anywhere between 80 to 100 feet in width it expands a bit  shrinks in a bit but it seems to be pushing into a very slight grade upward like this portion of  the ravine is making its way over probably the next mile or so to breach and hit surface  liam so from vorugal  matt from vorugal heading eastward it is slowly heading up you get about a quartermile in  before you begin to see the very thick ice being broken by occasional snowcovered dead trees 
none	 that  are breaking through as you saw before there are not a lot of trees in this central area of the  ravine but theyre becoming a little more common as you progress forward though many of them dead  thin and broken in places make another perception check laura  laura okay 16  matt okay its fine pushing forward in your mist form you do see that certain portions of the  upper ravine have an element of erosion to them that have broken down and there are some large  stones that have dropped and are 
none	 jutting out of the ice formation on the snowy platform floor you  glance around and you can see that there are a loose circle of maybe five six stones forming an  oval shape in the center and even looking about you can see this area seems to have seen some  scuffles it looks like portions of the walls have been scraped and clawed apart it looks like some  heavy impacts have hit the side if there was a place for there to be a setting ground for some  sort of a conflict of previous hunts 
none	 for vorugal this is probably what tooma was referring to  laura i look down towards it does it look like anything is around it  matt currently no it looks pretty  laura and sam ooh  laura oh no trees down  liam its an earthquake the trees fell down keyleth your spells are too powerful  marisha laughs i can save them i can save them all  sam wow matt  ashley its so pretty  laura it is so pretty  matt this circle of stones here  ashley did you make the  sam 
none	 its arendelle  liam hes been carving it this week  matt so this circle of stones the clusters of rock that have broken down and are sticking out  you dont know what the cultural significance of them are they appear to have been there for a  long time these were not a recent series of landmarks that were presented here these have  been here for a while but you do see a series of claw marks and damaged bits throughout the space  in the area that is uncharacteristic of the rest of the ravine floor 
none	 that youve been traversing  sam can vorugal see this spot  liam curved away  matt you make a perception check scanlan  sam oh im great at those  liam we just traveled about a halfmile  sam six  matt about a quarter mile you dont see vorugal from here so probably not  laura i would be looking for vorugal too though  matt perception check  laura natural 20  matt from this perspective its a little ways in the way the ravine has crawled in this  northeastern direction from where the lair center 
none	 was this area is not directly visible from  vorugal you cannot see for quite a bit that area  liam wind fingers for vorugal  laura all right can i float down and get a closer look at the weird marks you were talking about  matt yeah make an investigation check  sam while shes doing that im going to fly through pike a few times  laura 13  matt it tickles but not in a good way glancing about you can see there is some snowfall here and  some ice that has sealed off this 
none	 area a lot of the snow thats hit here gets blown away by the  wind thats coming through so there hasnt been a lot of snow packed in this vicinity a lot of  these large claw marks are indicative of dragon claws especially those of an ancient size you do  see bones scattered about many of them have been picked clean of varying sizes there appears to  be a halfeaten large insectlike carapace thats shoved off to the side a number of creatures  have fallen here and have been mostly eaten devoured or left to 
none	 be picked apart by the other  birds of prey that exist in this area  taliesin we have cover from either side of the top thats right im going to fly over to the  top of the far right of the ravine  laura behind those rocks right there  taliesin above them all the way up here and im going to take a look around and see if anybody  anythings around anything living that looks suspicious  matt perception check  taliesin youd think id be able to do this 18  matt okay glancing about 
none	 you can see every now and then a few birds fly overhead appear to be  hawks light gray in color theyre just looking around circling and vanishing in the distance you  do see a few small furred critters looks almost squirrellike but its too far away to make out  the details and youre not very specifically detailed make a nature check actually  liam check for critters  taliesin nine  matt you have no idea its furred its small it probably creeps you out a little  marisha giggles my friends  taliesin yeah im going 
none	 to survey would i think its safer above the ravine or within  matt id say within here its probably safer within the ravine up at the top this is not  indicative of the true height well say this is more of an example the ravine height is probably  closer to maybe 80 to 100 feet up  travis yeah got it  matt i just didnt want to build styrofoam that high  taliesin actually that works out perfectly for me then ill jump down to behind that rock and i  will demist behind that rock 
dung	  matt okay  sam ill see him doing that and join him  marisha yeah ill watch as they do that  taliesin i think a cave entrance right here to somewhere where you can hide after you do the  summoning and dive in and get about 25 to 30 feet away  sam question percy theres this annoying wind  laughter  liam vax flies around them  taliesin im not responsible for what you ate for breakfast  sam heres a question rather than scouting here digging a hole and going back to our mansion  
none	 should we just have a new mansion here  taliesin yes thats actually well kima  sam kima  taliesin thats all right somebody can mist back and bring her  sam i could technically drop that mansion and shed be on her ass laughs  taliesin i think shes already so delighted with you that might be a terrible idea  sam well someone could go back and get her we dont have to do this right now but when were  done here maybe we want to camp here so we have a place to hide inside a 
none	 mansion  taliesin thats a very good idea actually  sam and we dont even really need to make tunnels do we  taliesin we do we want to have places to hide  sam yeah thats true we want to spread out  marisha im going to mist down next to them  taliesin we want to have a place to hide and place to shoot from that has cover  marisha hey guys what are we talking about  taliesin digging a hole and moving the mansion here  marisha laughs god so windy tonight  sam i 
none	 know its so annoying  taliesin it also means that if something goes horribly wrong you can run downstairs and hide  marisha all right well heres the problem i need to figure out what all of this is made out  of i cant work with it if its just ice it has to be natural stone so cover for me im going to drop  down and start meditating  sam im going to scan the sky  marisha im going to do a commune with nature spell do we have any other questions before i do  
none	 this that we want to ask the land  travis were wind youre good  matt everything seems fine  laura were still wind  marisha in general i guess  taliesin how strong are the ravine walls and can we dig into them as well not just the ground  but the walls themselves small tunnels just big enough for one person  sam and theres these rocks here we know theres some rocks we knows that theres tons of ice  marisha do i need to figure out how far exactly vorugal is from us  sam we 
none	 saw him on the way over we know exactly where he is  marisha i have three good questions  liam weather forecast is not a bad idea  marisha no its not the weather forecast  taliesin yeah for tomorrow  sam what sorts of things can you ask nature  marisha naturey things i can ask it about  liam wheres the closest erewhon  marisha yeah is there a starbucks nearby  matt three questions what you got  marisha oh i was asking yeah i can ask it about topography i can ask about locations  
none	 of people nearby things like that  laura ask about what the rock is so you can find where to dig  taliesin and wheres the green dragon  marisha oh thats a good idea where the fuck is raishan okay  laura she might be with us right now  marisha she might be okay now i do this  matt okay  marisha first and foremost what is the geological makeup of this land around me this  ravine cliffside  matt what is the geological makeup  marisha what is it made out of yeah  matt 
none	 stone  marisha and all of this stuff on the edges  matt all of this is stone with about a foot layer of ice on the outside of it portions of it that  have been broken or struck you can see some exposure to it this ravine is not normally  covered in snow and ice vorugals presence has brought a persistent blizzard and icy atmosphere  to it so all the ice and snow you see here is technically not natural to the terrain and most  of this ravine has a very strong foundation of solid 
none	 stone natural rock and other various  geological layers beneath  marisha so it is fairly sturdy and not apparently going to collapse at any moment  matt correct it appears like what happened with you and pike earlier was an anomaly that only happens  when you roll two natural ones  marisha sure okay can i get a sense on what the weather is going to be like for the next 24 hours  matt reaching out to the vicinity and picking up what you can its hard to get specifics but it  looks to be at 
none	 least a coming sleet storm not hail nothing too heavy but it looks like its  going to have some times of limited visibility and very cold  marisha bummer okay good to know and do i sense raishan  matt within three miles you get the essence of the surrounding terrain that there is another  large dragon presence nearby though you dont get a specific location  marisha bummer  taliesin it was a good thought  sam no thats good to know  marisha shes within three miles  laura shes here or its thordak  marisha 
none	 well no hes said another aside from thordak  liam aside from vorugal  matt no you asked for raishan raishan was confirmed to be within the vicinity  marisha okay thats it those are my three questions  matt as that question fades you do get a little better bit of location of raishans current  presence raishan is currently on the very south end of the ravine on the outskirts of the  threemile radius of near where you are right now close to where you guys first came to the ruins of  draconia where you were 
none	 first discovered by the ravenites thats all you know about her just  that location  marisha close to the ruins of draconia  matt where you guys first arrived when you first came here  liam not near us right now  marisha and not where the library and the ruins of draconia were  matt yeah south of all that  taliesin all right i like the idea of someone going back to get kima i think one tunnel on this  side one tunnel on the other side and one tunnel on the top of the ravine 
none	 on either side if you  can do that  marisha and do we want them to connect so we can get through little half loops semicircles  sam does this make noise will it vibrate the ground  marisha im pushing out earth yeah  taliesin not a ton of noise  marisha vex and i mentioned that  taliesin how loud will this be do you think  marisha how loud will this be  matt as loud as moving large pieces of stone and earth would  travis loud  matt not stealthy work  sam we 
none	 saw a storm coming has it hit yet  matt no youve got a few more hours  sam we can wait until the storm comes itll be super windy and loud  travis not nearly enough to move tunnels of earth and rock  sam can you do something to ice melt it thats silent  marisha yeah but its only a foot of ice  sam yeah but we could carve out ice tunnels  liam no the ice is only a foot thick coating what is normally a temperate region  travis we got the house we 
none	 got the mansion thats it  liam but its one spot  sam we can hide behind rocks  marisha we could do a test  sam can you make new rocks that are hollow i guess itll still make noise  marisha i could make walls of stone i can make little but also keep in mind anything that  i do hell notice and the whole point to this is to not make our presence known at all  laura and ice dragons burrow i remember that much  marisha so we could pop in our tunnels and 
none	 they could be like whats up  sam how important are these tunnels because if we want while youre doing this i can go distract  the dragon  marisha on the other end of the ravine  sam sure why not  taliesin and liam no  travis why would you do that  sam to distract the dragon so you can dig  liam because we can use your mansion and when the time is right we can all scatter in different  directions quickly many of us can fly i would rather have these cubbyholes as well 
none	 but its  too risky and its too risky to let you go running your little ass off around and get that  dragon to eat you in one bite youre overruled  travis how do we go get kima  laura somebody that can turn invisible has to go get her  marisha well youre still mistform that lasts for eight hours you can mist back  laura yeah but she cant turn into mist so you can go get her and turn her into mist  sam we have the stones what about the stones stones someone can 
none	 mist back with the stone then  mist back to us and give her the stone  liam yeah  taliesin thatll work  ashley ill do it  sam ooh  travis wait does the stone make any sound or light  taliesin no just goes poof  travis really then sure  taliesin little bit of a poof  laura its a little bit of light but we can hide behind something when she does it she can poof  from within the mansion before you make the mansion  travis she can poof from within the mansion 
none	  taliesin you cant poof within the mansion  matt you cant poof within the mansion it has to be on the same plane of existence  laura but its daylight so it should be fine  marisha the mansions considered a pocket plane  sam if pike is going back as mist no offense pike can you find the mansion  laura why dont you go with her  sam okay gladly  ashley oh okay youll know your mansion better  travis send the two bitties and were going to hide out im still in my mist form 
none	  sam did you guys demistify  laura well weve been talking so im going to say yes  sam hey clever elves can you scout around make sure were not being watched  liam there are no elves here my mother was a human do you want to go right now  laura ive been keeping an eye out but yes i will keep watch  sam were not being watched you sure those hawks are hawks  laura is anything watching us  matt make a perception check  laura 28  matt 28 looking about there are 
none	 a number of birds in the distance theres some that have flown  overhead since youve been here nothing that seems to be acting erratically or out of the  ordinary theres a couple that have come in a little close to watch and then went off their own  way curious as to whats going down in the ravine  liam those are some birds  laura i think we should all be mist though while we wait for them to get back just in case  taliesin im going to spend some time in this form just studying 
none	 to see if theres anything odd  about this circle at all studying the stones  matt okay  travis where is the circle oh thank you  matt right so pike and scanlan you guys go mist form make your way over back towards where the mansion  was placed takes you a while are you going through the ravine or are you going over the ravine  ashely over  matt okay so the two of you guys coast up to the side and over the top of the wall there is some  heavy dead forest area

none	 of the ice i can try and make sheets of ice  marisha but how long does stone shape last i thought it was just for a little bit  matt stone shape is instantaneous it just affects something  marisha i know but how much its only like a five foot cube right so i cant make a tunnel  matt not a heavy tunnel no  marisha right so no  taliesin we can alter the topography just a bit by taking out some of the ice and then opening it  up to make hiding places  
none	 marisha i can make a little trench like a trench wallline for you guys at the top of the ravine  for the shooters  liam yeah halfbubbles almost  marisha yes exactly  travis 80 to 100 feet up right  taliesin thatll do  laura yeah i can shoot from that height  marisha right along the ledge  laura actually after you do it i can try to disguise it so its not seeable from the air  matt okay so what are you doing youre making a small ledge  marisha so yeah im going to 
none	 do wall of stone fuck  taliesin we dont need a ton of space because were never going to move more than six  marisha yeah i basically want a little almost half wall for cover here and here just extending  the stonework  matt just out this way  marisha upwards  so that they can  matt oh okay i see  taliesin give us cover  marisha do the gears of war  travis can i raise a point taliesin do you have anything to keep you from falling if he attacks  you on that 
none	 ravine  taliesin it would be hard to fall if he attacks us the best thing actually if he attacks us up  there would be to jump  matt so youre using it twice then over here you said  marisha you know what let me flank it let me do one on that side and one over here yeah you think  sam why a hundred feet up  travis thats how tall the ravine is  sam can we just do 20 feet up  taliesin you have a broom i have a rope  marisha is 
none	 this excessive  sam yeah why a hundred feet why not 20 feet why not 30 feet  laura we cant do it in the middle of the stone we have to do it at the top  sam why  matt you could technically  marisha i guess i could actually because i can do a flat one okay all right you know what i  could make little pod bubbles for you guys on the half edge of the cliffs  taliesin make some pod bubbles  marisha ill do that  travis arent those going to be 
none	 obvious  taliesin im going to start pouring water on this stuff and its going to be ice again so quickly  marisha yeah if we try and camouflage it spend the rest of the day camouflaging it  taliesin ive already started working on camouflage  marisha the dm keeps looking at us like were crazy  matt im trying to figure this out guys  marisha all right heres what im going to do im going to make stammers little balconies  liam spit some lyrics girl  marisha giggles so smooth yeah little balcony ledges that they 
none	 can go on  matt okay well say  laura hes like i spent a really long time carving this shit you guys and youre going to  be altering it  matt its all good  liam is there any point to having you sharpshoot from behind that wall down below  matt so right there is what youre saying a little shelf  marisha yeah little ledge yeah a balcony i want to make a cliff balcony  matt how far up  taliesin i would take it to the far edge even further  liam if were

none	 little create water spells over top of it to start covering them with ice  matt okay  taliesin im creating a breakable ice shield for when its time but im just giving the nice cover  marisha yeah cover it with ice to make it look like the rest  matt okay go ahead and just roll a wisdom check roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier  marisha he normally only asks me that when were making a terrible plan  taliesin i know ooh check out the big brain  marisha check out the big brains 
none	 on brad 23  matt okay as an air ashari you have a very firm understanding of airflow temperature of air and  how best it can quickly freeze water over time utilizing the spells at your disposal over the  next 30 minutes or so you do manage to coat the visible recently created stone with a layer of ice  that in some regard would help hopefully camouflage it  marisha oh he let us do it  taliesin im just going to spend all my time also trying to keep hiding it keep reinforcing it  once 
none	 the mansions available im going to take water and slowly add layers  matt okay scanlan and pike you guys do manage to return as you watch the party preparing these  small little ledges outside of the ravine interior  sam hey guys did you see the dragon leave  laura i saw him fly away yeah  sam should we be concerned at all  laura that what hes going to get help  liam well maybe  sam that hes going to meet up with raishan and fuck us  marisha he was heading west right

none	 understand it its impolite  marisha shes good  laura it is quite impolite  matt watch as larkins expression gets very dire for a second like what are you doing  laura i whisper to pike  travis larkin are you ready to help us kill a dragon  matt thats what you hired me for isnt it  travis aye dont you think dragons are just the biggest dickfucks ever  matt to be honest yes  travis yeah  sam oh oh larkin  laura just fucking got it  sam oh yes i totally remember you

none	 afar  matt ill be providing support from a comfortable space  sam what kind of support longdistance attacks or healing  liam whats your style  matt oh lets just say in the beginning ill go ahead and bring some pain from a distance and  only close that distance when things get real nasty and hot  sam and larkin the reason we hired you now that i remember was for your extreme knowledge of  dragons and their behaviors tell me this should we be concerned when this one leaves his lair  about hobbling its lair 
none	 or somehow preventing it from returning  matt do you know when its returning  travis no  sam well we know that itll be coming here for a fight  matt if you dont know when its returning dont step into its lair  sam is there a way to prevent it from getting back to its lair  matt killing it  travis real simple answer i think  taliesin its not like a vampire  matt kima leans into you scanlan whos this  sam mercenary  marisha larkin  laura we hired him  travis yeah 
none	 hes a real deadeye  taliesin theres also going to be a field of  sam ravenites  laura potentially  liam yeah told you it was complicated yeah  matt kima crosses her arms for a second you also told me you had another ally coming  sam and taliesin we did  taliesin i wasnt there  sam who  travis we have a hard time keeping track of everyone that we hire and fire  taliesin thats why its going to be a great plan  sam you know why we have pike thats our other ally 
none	 shes here now  ashley here i am  matt im so confused right now  travis yeah its all right listen all youve got to do is smash dragon with us tomorrow yeah  matt which dragon  travis the white one  laura the white one thats here that will be here  liam the only one thats here  taliesin lets make the mansion right now please make the mansion  sam ill make the mansion behind a rock outcropping kima i need your help to make sure  im not spotted while i do this ritual 
none	  matt all right  laura so this is great tomorrow you pop in you summon we all pop back into the mansion were  hiding in the mansion while the fights going on  sam well someone has to be on the outside watching to find out whats happening  laura right  marisha should we have someone near where the dragon is so we can get eyes  sam someone who can be invisible someone who can be a hawk or ravenite  liam scanlan what are you going to do you going to pop this thing out 
none	 and then  hop in the mansion  sam tomorrow were talking about yes absolutely  laura so keyleth could be a hawk over by vorugal  marisha watching  laura is there any way to let us know though  taliesin not if were in the mansion  marisha yeah because the earrings dont work through the mansion right  matt from the inside to out no they have to be in the same plane  sam well someone would have to be next to the doorway pop their head in and say oi its on  but we 
none	 also have these bubbles of watching around dont we  taliesin which would be you and i before the fight  sam or i can just drop the mansion  marisha well the mansion could be good if things go terribly wrong  liam thats true if the mansion door is open and hidden behind that outcropping of rock there you  leave the door open but behind it keyleth could take to the sky i could find somewhere low and be  hidden i can dart inside i can be inside in a second  sam and at the 
none	 very least kima can be waiting inside the mansion as can our lesser stealthy  friend pike at least keep them in there  laura yeah sounds great  sam all right  taliesin its a plan  sam its something  taliesin its a plan anything more complicated would immediately fall apart when anything shifts  which will inevitably happen  laura actually can i do primeval awareness and search for dragons to see if vorugals even in the  area at all  matt sure as you concentrate you get a very strong nearby presence  marisha she 
none	 came in the mansion with us  taliesin no  sam there is no mansion yet i havent done it yet  marisha oh you havent done it yet never mind  matt and you sense a closing dragon presence at which point you hear in the distance  wingbeats  taliesin mansion  laura mansion right now  sam all right i will cast the mansion behind a rock  laura and run into it  taliesin we will see you in the morning  matt to  travis larkin  matt to larkin all right he goes right 
none	  taliesin thank you truly  laura seriously get in the mansion right now  matt you glance off the side and you can see larkin looking off into the distance and the  white dragon vorugal is curling in the air currently wrestling with something and then  shoots down back into the ravine to the lair  marisha can i get like a glimpse of it before i run in on what it is 27  matt 27  sam its yenk  laughter  marisha damn it  matt what brief view you have it appears to 
none	 be by its size comparison smalllooking but  glancing at it it looks to be some sort of a dire bear or dire wolf some sort of large furred  entity that is currently being torn apart midair  marisha so it went hunting  matt apparently may have been hungry  liam snack  matt you guys make your way into the mansion for a bit of a respite kima carries out the end of  it steps inside i dont trust that dwarf  taliesin excellent thats why youre here thats why hes not in here  laura 
none	 he cant know that you know  matt good to know  sam kima if it would help i can erase your memory of this whole thing  matt you finish that sentence and i will destroy you where you stand scanlan shorthalt  sam ill let it alone for now  marisha good idea  matt come near me  taliesin we wake up early before the sun rises those of us who have to hide hide once we see  them bringing him to the summoning circle we call the beast and we wait we are going to 
none	 be in the  most danger because were going to be right in the thick of it  laura what if he sees you percy im better at hiding myself  taliesin were both going to be hiding in an icecovered cubbyhole  laura a lot of white  taliesin its not possible to get to those cubbyholes without a difficult climb is it  laura i could always bring you up on the broom  matt if you get dropped off by broom its easy where is the mansion door again  sam behind the bigger rock where percys 
none	 stationed right now  liam yeah we should wake up before sunlight  matt guess well say as you guys all vanish from there the entrance is right there to the  mansion  marisha whos going to keep an eye on larkin  taliesin i think its hilarious that we can think we can  sam larkin can take care of  liam also weve no fucking idea where raishan is or what shes going to do if anything  taliesin we know that the one place she isnt is in here  laura larkin is raishan really  
none	 travis holy shit i even got that  laughter  laura youre the last one to realize that  travis youre the last person in this room and on the internet  laura no  liam its me im the last one i had no idea  sam hey it took me five minutes  taliesin wow oh my god were going to die  marisha i knew the second she walked up  sam ashley figured it out before us  ashley no she told me  matt as you guys rest to prepare for your next days excursion 
none	 were going to take a restroom  break here  liam its half of us laura jeez  matt well see you guys back here in a few minutes  break  matt welcome back so after that brief break you guys have taken your time in the evening to  rest up and get your spells back prepared for the coming confrontation your now oneday delayed  confrontation with vorugal as your evening comes to a close the next morning is now before you  marisha hang on we werent done we werent done we have to do things 
none	  laura yeah one last thing  marisha we have to eat we have to do the heroes feast for sure  sam whos going to do it  ashley i am  matt all right pike drops down a heroes feast 1000 gold out of your queue  laura thats okay  marisha and taliesin worth it man  matt all of you enjoy your first nonchicken related meal within scanlans mansion  laura feels good  matt first in a while at least so as part of the heroes feast guys if you recall the details  of 
none	 that circumstance  sam immune to fear  matt immune to fear definitely  marisha saves on wisdom throws  matt wisdom saving throws have advantage  marisha also plus 2d10  matt 2d10 to your maximum hit points  marisha and i think thats it  matt and youre immune to diseases immune to poison  laura gasps youre immune to poison on this  marisha thats right fuck you raishan  sam advantage on wisdom saves immune to poison  matt all right so marking hit points let me know what your maximum hit point totals increases

none	 and are we sure we dont want eyes on her im not concerned about her wellbeing  clearly im concerned on whatever her name shes saying she is right now  taliesin my theory on that subject is that shes clever enough that eyes on her would not be  helpful in the first place its best to assume that even if we could see her that she would be  tricking us over what shes doing  sam okay and if she starts killing us what do we do hide in the mansion regroup  taliesin hide in the 
none	 mansion and worstcase scenario scream that she betrayed us and that she  promised that she would help kill the white dragon and see if theyll fight it out  liam worstcase scenario well pull back towards the mansion if she starts whaling on us  taliesin yes and definitely inspire some conflict  laura and marisha okay  sam lets go fight  laura now we sleep  sam oh sleep  matt your evening meal complete you all find yourself back to full rest preparing yourselves  for tomorrows grand showdown  taliesin im at negative one  
none	 matt youre now negative one to all of your rolls ability checks and saving throws  taliesin not to damage though  matt no just your d20 rolls  liam you can get all 19s  laura as i am going to sleep i want to inscribe sinaeth on fenthras  matt okay  sam what  matt you dont know evenings rest complete spells chosen for those who need to choose spells  prepare yourselves for this confrontation the morning comes that early tension of imminent  chaos fills the air conversation is short what preparations do you wish

none	 taliesin to the wall so i have something to climb down with if i need to its not going to be  hanging out its all in  matt okay the stone is like a smooth wall that comes out and then upward for the protective point  laura i have climbing gear you can use it as a grappling hook maybe does that work at all  matt you can fashion something make an intelligence check  laura ten  taliesin six  matt it seems like itll hold you have a metal piece wedged into a part of 
none	 the stone that seems  pretty taut with the rope attached  marisha can i ask a logistical question how wide and alive are those trees  matt they are maybe a foot wide each and currently it looks like a lot of them are dying  or dead from the perpetual snowfall and coverage that they are unused to  marisha so tree stride probably wouldnt work on these guys im wondering if i should waste my time  matt tree stride same size as you some of them maybe  marisha all right  sam am i making 
none	 us all ravenites or does that not even matter anymore  laura i dont think that matters  sam okay  laura have we left are me and percy outside already  matt you guys have gone outside if youre going to place him up in his perch there and help cover  the area  liam you have to do it right because youre the one releasing this thing  sam i guess if im going to be out in the open i probably should  liam and if youre doing it does it take any more mojo to 
none	 do it to all of us or just yourself  it cant hurt to do it to all of us  sam sure  laura make us all white ravenites  sam you mean wearing white clothes  laura sorry i meant so we blend into the ice not so that were white that sounded so  terrible i meant so that were the same color as the ice and were camouflaged like chameleons  taliesin are there actually enough albino ravenites that we would stick out or is that a  common color  matt you havent really encountered 
none	 any  taliesin oh then i would recommend not i would recommend white clothing  matt youve seen varying shades of chromatic and metallic  taliesin all right  marisha snow camouflage  taliesin snowy  matt okay what are you doing  sam i guess ill make us all white ravenites normal ravenites with lightercolored clothing  that can maybe blend in but also we cant dance very well and we clap on the two and the four so  yes ill make us all ravenites  matt okay so does that include kima  sam i can do 
none	 eight people so thats everyone including kima  matt all right so you are all currently for the purposes of this visually ravenites of varying  sizes and bulkiness okay is everyone currently out and about right now outside of the house  sam im going out  laura who all is leaving  sam oh wait before i leave doesnt someone have to buff me up for this spell  marisha i do yep i do im going to cast enhance ability on your charisma  laura how long does that last  marisha an hour so if were 
none	 ready to go  sam yeah what time is it is it dawn  matt youre not entirely certain make a survival check  laura 18  sam eight  matt you have no idea scanlan its about noon from where you gather where the sun would be  around that time based on what bits of shadows you can see however the sleet storm is starting to  kick in and you can see now the sheets of really cold rain with a slush to them are beginning to  pound across the bottom of the ravine the wind 
none	 is picking up a bit and the temperature is dropping  significantly  laura bundle  marisha yep  sam okay how will we know when its time for me to release we have to wait for tooma to go report  laura is vorugal back hes back  sam i assume  laura do we see larkin around  matt no you do not see larkin around  sam vax do you want to go look  liam for larkin  sam no fuck larkin to see when toomas coming i dont want to release this thing before tooma 
none	 is  there reporting to vorugal  laura well maybe if we cause enough of a ruckus as soon as we release him  liam i mean if we trust tooma to hold up her part of the bargain that dragon is coming here  laura we need to make a lot of noise and then release it attract attention release it hide  sam but when  laura whenever we want to  sam no when is vorugal coming we cant sit out here all day waiting  laura vorugal will come when we make a noise hell come 
none	 over here  sam the ravenites have to tell him to come here first  laura no she told him that its coming i dont think shes telling him a specific time  sam no shes telling him now today we told her to wait  matt as you guys are having this conversation vax and keyleth you guys notice down off the  southern edge of the ravine you see three humanoid figures walking up to your direction  coasting along the side of the mountain range  marisha do they appear to be ravenites  matt after a 
none	 short time inspecting them they appear to be ravenite in structure yeah they are  dragonborn they are heavily robed and they are coasting up along the side  marisha vex you want to talk to them they might have told him might have been the ones that just  told him  laura i walk over  matt as you acknowledge them and begin to approach one of them breaks from the two and they  stay back as it approaches you can see the tall burly dragonborn form this is skork you met when  you first came 
none	 to the ruins of draconia he approaches tooma sends me when are we to tell  the dragon the hunt is on  marisha were ready whenever you are  laura give us 30 minutes and then do it  matt 30 minutes it will be done he returns to the other two and they begin to make their way  rather briskly back towards the direction of vorugals lair  taliesin when you see the dragon pop up into the sky and head this direction start summoning  laura percy up  taliesin yes please  laura all right 
none	 i take percy up top  matt you bring percy up onto the top the rain is starting to come down hard now and youre  instinctively getting chills and shivering a little bit you get up into your little parapet  area place him there  laura i try to move some snow around and try to block it  matt percy i need you to make a stealth check just in general  sam who me  matt no just percy  taliesin thats 16  matt 16 good to know okay so you place him up there

none	 matt okay as you pull the scroll out and begin reading it the sigils and arcane glyphs are  ancient and convoluted and youre trying to trace them with your eyes and you begin speaking  letting the ancient knowledge that youve gained through your existence of wandering exandria begin  to pour out on its own you feel the magic take hold and your grip tightens as the script  begins to light up with a slight bluishpurple tint as it begins to light up around i need you  to check to see if you succeed in reading

none	 the glyphs begin to shake and part of the scroll begins to burn at the edges  you maintain concentration staring at it the rains hammering down on the scroll its growing  slick and pouring off into the center of your sleeve youre soaked to the bone now and  shivering as youre reading out these various language bits that are flowing through youre now  an instrument for the spell that is beyond your capability and as suddenly the spell finishes  your fingers tighten and the scroll bursts into flame and turns to dust around you and 
dung	 for a  split second you think you may have failed  spell noises this giant bluish doorway erupts across the way  sam facing away from me  matt facing away from you you see all of you that the somewhat dark and shadowed ravine is now  suddenly aglow with bright vibrant bluish light the blue light turns to crimson to a deep burning  red and you hear this horrible deep sucking sound and you watch as yenk the goristro is  thrown from it landing in the center of the ravine fist to the ground  
none	 laura and ashley were going to die  matt are you leaving the gate open  sam no i close it instantly  matt okay the gate slams shut behind the reddish light then now being consumed with a final  blip of blue before it disappears  sam im going to tiptoe backwards into the mansion  matt well the goristro swoops the head over in your direction i need you to make a stealth check  sam thats a seven  liam oh sam groans  travis whispers roll a little better  matt you watch as the 
none	 hulking behemoth its extremely muscular body covered in fur and bony  protrusions like spikes that jut out of its form horrible hooked teeth and giant curled horns that  push forward with brass jewelry emblazoned across the bone whips around its red eyes beaming  straight on you in a deep guttural voice it foreign words and begins to just lumber in your  direction  marisha oh god  matt for right now i need you just for right now scanlan roll initiative  laura oh my god  sam 21  cheering  matt all right youre 
none	 going before it does what are you doing  liam bamf to the door and go in  travis focus your chi  sam i sing at it  laura oh my god  taliesin no hes got a movement and an action  sam i sing at it i will sing singing yenk you will be our friend travel through the portal  and back again your heart is true youre a fiend and a confidant boom boom boom speaking all  right so i will dominate monster with the hand cone  matt right all right puts you 
none	 at a full dc of what  sam 21  matt 21 that is a 13 those who are watching yenk comes barreling and then comes to a stop and  stands there looking down at this tiny gnome about 40 feet away and nods  sam i say you will stay here and you will kill a white dragon  matt you see steam shoot out from the nose as now you notice the sound of the wings whooshing  sam and i will tiptoe back into the mansion  marisha that was the coolest thing youve ever done 
none	  matt at which point  taliesin no  yelling  sam its huge  laura oh no hes so big  travis holy shit  liam make all the action figure sounds matt  ashley thats a biggie  matt at this point in time vorugal lands snorting and unleashes a torrent of frozen ice  in this direction  marisha ive been waiting for this all week  laura i hope we can take it and it actually does damage  matt that is going to be  marisha just dies instantly oh fuck apparently white dragons are 
none	 its weakness  laura i know  sam were in a lobby eating chicken  travis a little elevator music playing  matt as the blast hits you can see coats of ice across the floor so you guys are aware the ice  and sleet and everything here is making the entire terrain rough terrain so everyone is at half  speed on foot in this entire battlefield you can see the actual air around vorugal itself is  crystallizing into thick mist that surrounds his form sightly yenk is blasted with all this frozen  frostbreath and you 
none	 can see the icicles crystallizing against his form roars goes  running forward and slams goring with its horns into vorugals chest  laura this feels like more like playtime than anything all the action figures bam bam bam  matt watch me play with my toys guys all right you watch as the horns slam into vorugals chest  not really expecting the ferocity and the sheer force of this entity its unfamiliar with the  horns spark with flames strangely it also tears this giant gash in two points across vorugals  chest you can see white scales 
dung	 fly from the impact and also okay it is not pushed vorugal  stands its ground as yenk pulls back you see dark purple blood from the edge of the horns of the  goristro end of his turn all right does not save against the dominate monster  sam yeah that means hes still dominated okay  taliesin he has not realized this is possibly a poor idea  travis yenks going to go come on chum lets be friends  matt it did take damage from the ice breath so it would have been trying to make its 
none	 save did  not make it at the end of yenks turn vorugal is going to use two of its legendary actions to do a  wing attack with a three yenk is knocked prone and he suffers 15 points of bludgeoning damage at  which point vorugals moving  takes up into the air right above now coming to vorugals turn vorugal gets cold breath back and  while yenk is on the ground looking upward and trying to get back up from the slick snow  releases another blast of cold breath down onto yenk once more constitution 
none	 save plus 14 does  make its save again its a hardy individual constitution saves are high it causes this  cluster of ice to gather around his form and he breaks free vorugal is then also going to use its  flight to move over this way and spin around  liam natural 20 on my stealth  matt yenk is going to use its turn to stand up it looks around it does make its save breaking  dominate monster so that is gone  sam okay would i feel that no im on another plane of existence 
none	  matt youre on another plane of existence you guys are all in this quiet space fingers crossed  hoping right now yenk looks frustrated at this point in time not a whole lot i can do right now  at the moment so its going to run beneath and attempt to leap to grab it unfortunately it  does not make the full height leaps up in the air with all its strength its thick muscular hoofed  hind legs crouch down and leaps in the air its giant claws reaching forth but vorugal keeps just out  of 
none	 reach and kicks out with its claws and tail knocking it back onto the ground  it lands no effect  vorugals turn now actually at the end of yenks turn no its not close enough come back to  vorugals turn vorugal does not get the ice breath back its going to swoop down eager to  finish this hunt and is going to unleash a series of attacks  yeah this is an interesting dynamic right now because it looks like yenk is resisting a lot of  the cold impact from this vorugals going to do a 
none	 full range of attacks hits with the bite hits  with the claw hits with the tail lands and bites into him you see ice shards go shooting off from  the impact with the teeth both claws tear into the chest but you can see the flesh itself is  hardy and resistant to the dragons attacks its damaging it but yenk is definitely made of  sturdier stuff  laura while this is going on percival  taliesin yes  laura if yenk dies really fast what do we do  taliesin im going to signal them to 
none	 come out  laura oh fuck  matt okay it comes to yenks turn now as you guys are having this conversation he is going to  make two of its fist attacks and one with its hoof  sam yes yenk yes  matt a hit a miss and a hit  taliesin hes expending power as well  marisha yeah hes burned two of his legendary actions already yeah were watching the dragon  burn through his legendary actions  taliesin thats the other thing  laura oh thats great  matt legendary actions it gets every turn 
none	  laura he hasnt burned through any resistances though  matt you watch as after the clawing goes through yenks chest yenk reaches up and grabs the edge  of vorugals scaly back of its head and uppercuts right into the jaw and then brings up one of its  hooves and straightup chest kicks with the sharpened hoof into the center of vorugals chest  it leaves vorugal stumbling back for a second at the end of that turn its going to use two of its  legendary actions to once again beat its wings yenk not being a 
none	 very dexterous individual fails  and gets knocked prone once again sending vorugal once again up to there back to vorugals turn he  does not get the ice breath but it looks like vorugal actually is moving further and further  away and is biding his time  sam im going to cast invisibility on myself and poke my head out the door yeah thatll work  matt yeah you look out make a perception check the sleet is coming down pretty hard so youre  having to glean what you can  sam fucking eight  matt you 
none	 can see some movement of dragon stuff in the air and you hear various pitches of growling  horrible angry yelling in the center of the battlefield  marisha so we know theyre here  matt you know theyre there  sam battle is still going on ill check again in 12 seconds  matt yenks turn very frustrated cant seem to figure out what to do is going to attempt to leap  once more nope he runs leaps tries to grab at the foot vorugal steps out of the way yenk  finishes landing on the opposite side 
none	 no effect turns around all right vorugal gets the cold  breath back he is going to fly backwards and as it does sprays an unholy mess of frozen breath  energy down towards yenk who does not make the save but still takes resistant damage thanks to  cold resistance you watch with each impact yenks open wounds are getting frost shards jammed into  them right now it looks like yenk doesnt have much of a recourse until vorugal is on the ground  and vorugal seems to have noticed this and is starting to keep a distance 
none	 and is waiting  marisha i can ground him  sam and expose yourself  marisha im just throwing it out there i can ground him  matt back to yenks turn at the end of vorugals turn vorugal is going to take up about ten more  feet to get completely out of his leaping range there  liam how high is he  matt right now 60 feet up yenk leaps and cant quite get that height and angrily begins to reach  over and climb up the side of the mountain there  liam can i attack 
none	 him right now  matt whats up  liam can i attack him right now  matt which one  liam vorugal 60 feet im sharpshooter hes 60 feet away from me  matt 60 feet is your range hes a little higher than 60 feet from the angle  sam are you on the ground  laura hes on the ground  liam pop out the wings  matt or the wings you could do that  liam fly within 40 feet of him throw whisper at his ass thats what im doing assassin  sam are you going 
none	 to go up his ass into his stomach  laura in the dragon again  sam in the dragon  matt all right as you step over the wings unleash and you fly up right underneath vorugal  right there  liam do i need to roll for stealth though  matt no youre still stealthed you were holding that yeah you dont seem to be noticed right  now vorugals attention is faced over as its floating staring at yenk whos now starting to  climb up the side of the mountain  liam so finally this is advantage 
none	 and an automatic critical hit assassin trait  matt well lets see id say given the circumstances it is unaware that you are part of  the battlefield even though there is a current threat in its circumstance so in this situation let  me doublecheck real fast  sam its not even a dungeons and dragons book  taliesin its a cookbook  sam theyre all people  sam and taliesin its a cookbook  matt i would say given the fact that its completely unaware there was any other combatants  in the vicinity aside from yenk i 
none	 will allow this to be a surprise attack from you though he  is not considered surprised to anybody else there isnt a surprise round  liam all right i rolled a 28  matt oh that hits  liam this is whisper im using whisper im going to cast divine smite on the attack as well  matt all right roll damage on that  ashley kill him one turn  liam here we go two  laura laughing four  liam hold on no so all the dice first two plus the psychic damage which is 1d8 nine 
none	 plus the  divine smite which is 15 yeah here comes the sneak attack damage counting 38 plus my modifier  which is 46 no we double the dice first so 38 times two 76 plus eight is 84  matt 84 points of damage against vorugal are you going with the blade or you letting it sit  liam oh i went with the blade  laura so youre on vorugal right now  matt so as you throw the blade up it strikes into one of the wounds that yenk had already  clawed under its chest and 
none	 the blade sinks up to the hilt and further in and as you appear youre  actually wristdeep in the wound right now  travis back in the dragon again  matt you are right up with vorugal right now  liam im hasted thats action number one action number two is to throw whisper down toward the  trees closest to you dm and bamf there and use my bonus action to hide ill hit the ground right  matt the blade loses its luster and stumbles into the snow clinking hits the ground its out of  range 
none	 it doesnt hit anything solid you dont go with the blade  liam im going to push off him then  laura you have wings  liam yeah i know that what did i use i used 40 feet of movement  matt correct  liam okay i dont know how much i have left if im hasted i would have 120 total but thats  halved so 20 feet because you said rough terrain but im in the air  matt youre in the air but theres a lot of sleet and rain hitting  liam so ten feet 
none	 thats all right im going to keep moving away im going to use all my movement  to get away from him and go away from his butt i should have a bonus action that i can use the  rest of my movement plus dash  matt all right before you get there hes now roars the angry scream vorugals head swoops  around underneath and directly into your eyes as you dart away with the blade he spins in place  and bites at you as youre trying to pull away  liam i have advantage on dexterity 
none	 saving throws  matt okay this is a bite attack so it doesnt matter so that is a 26  liam that hits  matt all right so you take 22 points of piercing damage  liam okay can i uncanny dodge this is this melee  matt yeah its a melee attack so you can do that plus 14 points of cold damage  liam which is halved because of my armor so 26 down to 13 and seven 20 total  matt yeah 20 total reduced by half because of uncanny dodge you said  liam okay so

none	 percy  taliesin im holding  matt going to use the rest of his action to climb up gets all the way to the top of the ravine  which is about at the same height that vorugal is based on your help i need you to roll another  stealth check because you helped him for the last half hour you have advantage because she was  helping you  taliesin oh 13 13 because im at a negative one  laura 13 thats worse than it was before  matt yenk gets to the top and turns around 
none	 and sees vorugal off to the side glances down and  goes foreign words and is going to make a giant bowling underhand fist punch  right towards you percy  taliesin i was holding ready can i try and beat his initiative and get a shot off first  matt as a reaction right now you can go ahead and take a shot  marisha its time to go  sam has it been two rounds  taliesin jenga  matt its been more than two rounds since this started  sam how about since i looked last

none	 seems to sparkle  with electrical energy as it goes to impact you  taliesin thats magic  matt it is not a magic spell no you take six points of lightning damage  marisha yenk is on top  matt yenk is at the top of the ravine  marisha isnt percy halfway down  matt yenk got up to where he would see him and then saw him as he was passing by  stopped to slam him  taliesin so 23 plus six thats fine the lightning damage the cloak doesnt absorb that  matt no  
none	 taliesin okay then im going to do my damage on him which is new to me thats terrible thats  11 points of damage plus two points of psychic damage  matt 13 points of damage gets pushed back because hes still holding onto the edge he has  to see if he can no it does not yenk loses grip from the blast of the gun after  punching you stumbles back claw hits the edge and falls down prone to the ground at the base of  the ravine 40 feet  taliesin 50 feet  matt 50 
none	 feet taking an additional 16 points of bludgeoning damage which is halved  taliesin do i join the initiative order  matt you do go ahead and roll initiative  taliesin 21  matt 21 all right that ends yenks turn vorugal does not get the ice breath back however  does see both of you in the vicinity  laura me  matt does not see you no but it sees vax and percy  taliesin it sees me all right  matt the blast of the gun and the impact and the whole encounter with yenk exposed you 
none	 its going  to use its action to use frightful presence so i need both percy and vax and vex actually  because youre still within the range to make a wisdom saving throw you have advantage you guys  are immune to frightening so it doesnt actually affect you regardless so dont worry about it  liam dont roll  matt dont have to roll youre immune to fear yenk makes his saving throw so yenk is not  afraid either  marisha thanks pike should we pop out should we do this  laura no not yet  
none	 sam after 12 seconds i will look i will stick my head out and look again  matt vorugal is now watching the battlefield and seeing the people that have been revealed  vorugals going to go up a little higher  sam hes a total notagoodhunter i thought he enjoyed the hunt  matt he doesnt enjoy being ambushed or in a fight that he cant win  sam ive poked my head out to look  matt okay you look out and you see vorugal way high in the air you see yenk on the ground and

none	 he wants to kill us  taliesin except that he also has a dragon to contend with so as long as we keep it a bigger  threat than us i think hell keep his concentration where it is  marisha we should still try to stay out of all this  matt everyone who has rolled initiative will be on the next initiative order vax youre  finishing up this round  liam oh i am i would like to throw whisper to the rock i was initially hiding behind  and bamf there  matt roll an attack 
none	 roll  liam yeah sure thats 25 i would like to use my bonus action to hide behind that rock  matt okay go ahead and roll a stealth check  liam that is a 25 can i hold my last action  matt you could hold an action to do one thing with a trigger sure  you can use your hasted action  liam im going to stay put stay hidden  matt all right that brings us to the top of the round percy youre at the top  taliesin oh boy okay im going to take

none	 to flap vorugal tumbles out of the air for a second  and just manages to catch himself and the final shot impacts right in the back of the skull spines  and shatters part of the bone and ice off of it leaving a nice fresh wound in the  back of the head  taliesin now im going to take cover in my little cove  liam id like to think of you driving and cutting someone off on the 101 and going  plus five necro  taliesin plus five necro motherfucker  matt all right  
none	 taliesin hes checking the sheet oh no  laura oh no what are you looking at  taliesin it means theres a very angry dragon now thats looking at me  matt okay so kima whos now eager to get out there goes okay all right lets do this  shes going to cast aura of vitality on herself as her action then she goes running through the  center of the portal leaps out turns the corner to there and stops and goes oh shit  thats her turn  marisha thats her turn  matt shes just entering 
none	 the fray and did a preparation spell as part of that ending kimas  turn lets see here from out of seemingly nowhere in particular you see a flash of  electrical energy arcing from one of the nearby sections of the crevasse alcove the bolt of  energy arcs out and slams into vorugal who does not make the save not seeing it there  taliesin all right weve got a game  sam five points of damage  marisha what are you good for  matt thatll be 41 points of lightning damage  sam okay  marisha 
none	 remember she learned from the druids a bunch of fucking nature shit  matt one of the arcs tries to reach for yenk and manages to disperse before it can get to it its  not quite within range but that finishes wherever that lightning source was yenk angrily is going  to stand up and turn it is going to attempt to run and grab up at vorugal again  marisha and sam come on yenk  matt leaps and misses impact landing right next to the rock thats a natural 20 on a  perception check as it 
none	 lands impact and looks over right into your face  liam hi  matt yenk is now aware of you  taliesin hes just noticing everybody  matt at the end of yenks turn thats not going to help him right now thats going to end that  vorugals turn breath does return this time vorugal from up here is going to send ice breath  across the entire ground sweeping up across both yenk and vax i need you to make a constitution  saving throw  liam could i use evasion for this  matt no its constitution 
none	  liam all right im going to use luck first luck of the day all right 13  matt 13 no you suffer 72 points of cold damage halved because of your resistance  ashley how much again  matt 72 but halved because of your cold resistance 36 points of cold damage to you  travis um what  matt vorugals then going to take higher up into the air  taliesin can he do that already even recovering from the prone  matt yeah the idea with prone is that unless theres something that maintains or it cant 
none	  improve its movement past its next turn it continues to fall thats going to finish  vorugals turn grog youre up  travis im up  matt yep youre still inside the mansion  sam do not draw attention to yourself friend  travis fuck that were all going down i take the titanstone knuckles and i smash them together  and i use the enlarge and i will burst out of the mansion in a rage  liam big grog  matt so thats 30 feet of movement you have 20 more feet if you want  travis

none	 you move behind the rock you have to break  eye contact to stealth  travis ill use that dash to keep moving towards the ice wall towards you maybe two or three  squares that will be my turn  matt you can get there hulking axe gripped giant grog is leaping through the snow impacts  youre twothirds the size of yenk right now which is crazy all right that ends grogs turn  scanlan youre up  sam me im still invisible im going to leave the mansion  matt youre not still invisible because you cast

none	 after vax  ashley im going to pop out maybe i can stay in there and do this in the door and try to cast  divine intervention  matt divine intervention all right so you step out and you see this chaos happen the dragon in  the air the fiend on the side swinging and barely missing a flying vax who swoops past in  the middle of this sleet storm you close your eyes and concentrate holding your holy symbol  praying that sarenrae has the ability to reach beyond the divine gate and lend you her 
none	 strength  temporarily i need you to roll a d10  marisha man how awesome would this be  laura it would be insane  matt what did you roll  ashley a ten  matt a zero  laura yeah a zero  marisha excited gasping shut the fuck up she has to roll under her level which she did  matt so this succeeded  marisha shut the fuck up ashley  matt so as you clutch your holy symbol concentrating hoping that shes there feeling  the division between the gods and their followers since the divergence 
none	 occurred youve reached out  to her a number of times you look up through the darkness of your closed eyes and you see a light  a beacon open the clouds part and suddenly the sound of rain goes away the sound of all the  chaos goes away and its just warmth and quiet and you watch as sarenraes hand comes down and  touches your forehead and with your closed eyes and says ill do what i can as she drifts away  and smiles you watch as her hand turns into a fist and she looks 
dung	 up and disappears into the  light as you open your eyes you now see up in the sky above vorugal the clouds that are dark  a sparkle of divine energy begins to swirl as it grows stronger and stronger the clouds suddenly  part and a giant column of divine energy boom slams down right on top of vorugal vorugal looks  up just in time to try to move out of the way before it slams him back does not make his dex  save with a roll of five vorugal suffers 50 points of divine damage 
none	  and is slammed onto the ground  cheering  taliesin stay down  marisha yes  holy fuck pike that was amazing  ashley oh boy  liam action figure is down  matt additional 26 points of bludgeoning damage as the light column slams vorugal to the ground  you can see some of the ice and snow underneath melts immediately and what was once a column you  can see now looks like a giant fist made of spiritual energy that then withdraws slowly off  the back of vorugal and then dissipates before the clouds close 
none	 up once more  ashley yes it worked  matt thats your movement and your action  ashley for a bonus action i would like to place a spiritual weapon at the back of his neck since  hes on the ground and i would like it to be a very large flaming sword  matt okay you watch as the hand of sarenrae dissipates some of the energy thats residual  there lingers and then forms into a flaming sword of pure goldenwhite energy it is now hovering  over the currently slammeddown brokenlooking body of vorugal  sam

none	 going to use  the rest of her action to dash and get right up next to vorugal and is going to use her bonus  action to use vow of enmity against it she goes you are going to see bahamut in pieces as she  brings the thumb across the holy symbol glows for a second you see a mark emblazon and burn itself  into the side of vorugals body thats going to end kimas turn  taliesin thats a sick tattoo yall  laura maybe its like hex and hunters mark  travis we dont know 
none	 what that does  matt whats the range on that actually thats going to be a rough call okay you watch as  emerging from the treeline here you see a little dwarf step forward unaffected by the ice and  reach out a hand as a cluster of necrotic energy sparkles in the center leaps forward toward  vorugal that is a success on the save so its half damage but keyleth you recognize at a  glance of your eye this necromantic leap this is a blight spell  sam blight spell  laura whos doing a blight

none	 so thats going to be 48 points of damage from yenk slams a fist  once and glides off the scales second one goes and slams into the side of vorugals neck and  then picks up the hoof and jams it into the side of the skull cracking into the side of vorugals  head you can see some teeth break and get thrown off and scatter into the ice and snow nearby at  the end of yenks turn vorugal is going to go ahead and use two actions to wing attack once  more getting up lets 
none	 see yenks going to have to make a strength save fails kima fails as  well they are both knocked prone and suffer bludgeoning damage  travis only if youre right on him im only two squares away i think  matt you are also within 15 feet grog technically so i need you to make a strength  saving throw  travis 17  matt 17 does not cut it you take 15 points of bludgeoning damage and you are knocked prone  liam all the trees are down  matt its rough and vorugal gets half its speed

none	 embracing the ageold tradition of the air ashari keyleth vanishes into a form of swirling  wind picking up the various bits of sleet and snow around you  youre almost like a slushy tornado  marisha thats cool can i then take whatever movement i have left to try and drag  matt youve already used your action to cast the spell unfortunately  marisha i cant use my movement to try and move someone  matt you can use your movement to move to pull somebody with you  marisha thats an action  liam its all right 
none	 im fine  marisha then im going to use my movement to go airborne i think i can go 60 feet let me see my  fly speed i have 90 feet  matt 90 feet so it would be 45 feet up if you want to  marisha yeah  laura kick him on the way up and then hell follow you  marisha i give him a little air poof kick in the face just for flavor  matt sure why not  marisha hes getting slushied in the face  matt you rush up into the air 
none	 vorugal does not get an attack of opportunity because he already  used his reaction against you so you whoosh without an issue  marisha i hope that was right  matt all right that ends your turn percy  taliesin okay im going to take my three shots  matt right above you you see raishan wings beating looking over and assessing the  battlefield you see vorugal down there bloody you see yenk bloodied both engaged and  distracted you are currently not in either of their attentive sphere  taliesin oh yeah so the first thing im 
none	 going to do is im going to use my bonus action to reload  im going to take my three shots at the white dragon with what i have left i can do nothing  thats 30  matt 30 hits  taliesin one necrotic 12 points with one necrotic shot number one next shot same thing  standard shot that ran but 22 oh sorry its not 22 im so tired 17 that misses  matt 17 misses unfortunately it hits the side but the shot shatters across the dragonhide  ashley can i do war gods blessing from 
none	 where im at  matt you know what hold on percy you are conscious on the ground barely paying attention  and all of a sudden you hear the shot go off and you see it about to blast against the hide as a  war cleric ill see if he has to be within range or if its one of the things that you can do if he  attacks an enemy the creature has to be within 30 feet of you so no hes way too far  taliesin 24 for the next shot  matt third one 
none	 does hit  taliesin thats 12 points with two points of necrotic and im going to grab my rope and im  going to wave at the green dragon and start dropping down  matt okay  taliesin i have a rope  matt i know you do as you leap off the side the clench in the stone tink comes loose and you  impacts tumble down the hill i need you to make an acrobatics check  taliesin yeah i can do that even at negative one i can do that no i cant that was a one 
none	  matt natural one you tumble homer simpsonstyle repeated impacts down the icy rocky side  landing prone and suffering 18 points of bludgeoning damage on the way landing prone on  the ground impact groan  taliesin fine  matt kimas turn kimas going to go and flank yenk against grog giving her advantage on her  first attack yeah thats a 25 to hit and her second attack is yeah both hit the first  strike with her holy thunder maul 19 points of damage against the goristro and shes going to  burn another 3rdlevel spell to 
none	 do a holy smite at third level all righty 23 additional radiant  damage on top of that and then her second strike shes going to burn her last 3rdlevel spell to do  another smite that is 16 counting 31 nice yeah she did a lot of damage on that round  slamming twice with the maul into the backside of yenk the first one slams into the shoulder  sending him to the ground with his fist grunts he starts getting back up she spins using the  inertia and slams the maul into the side of his 
none	 knee which pops out and sends him down onto one  knee now and yenk is basically halfprostrate in front of you grog preparing for your next round  of combat growls ending kimas turn it is now raishans turn  travis she made him bend the knee  matt raishan does not get the breath back however is going to fly not used to the ice and  cant quite get to full speed there but can get close enough to attempt a blight spell at the  very least vorugal fails thats an 18 yeah fails the save 
none	  laura blight spell  marisha a lot of damage come on  sam hes going to resist it  taliesin he might have burned it  matt yeah burning a legendary resistance to make it happen so it still makes the save so its  still half but it has one left okay so it takes 18 points of necrotic damage thats the end of  that turn it is now yenks turn yenk is going to do a fullon multiattack against you grog that  is a 24 to hit  travis thatll hit  matt actually it 
none	 has advantage on you because you used reckless attack that hits second one is  26 to hit  travis hits  matt and natural 20 all right  travis im going to use my stones endurance on the natural 20 and ill do retaliation on one of  those three hits  sam retaliation thats new  matt so the first fist is 29 points of piercing damage so reduce that to 14 plus three points of  fire damage as the fist suddenly bursts into flame as it slams into you the secondary fist comes  swinging around 
none	 the other way dealing 20 points of piercing damage reduced to ten plus you take  eight points of lightning damage as suddenly an arc of energy streaks from the fist slamming into  the other side of your face as youre taking it on each side as you grin he leaps up into the  air his strong thick legs getting almost up above you then kicks down with its hooves towards  you like a very angry goat this is the critical  laura what does stones endurance do  travis d12 plus my constitution modifier  matt 
town	 reduce the damage yeah  taliesin ive been hit by a goat in the face before no really i got nailed by a goat  liam at the zoo  taliesin no we were filming this ridiculous television series called hell town when i was a  kid it was awful  liam you werent trying to call satan  taliesin not in the show either  matt 46 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to 23 plus ten points of ice damage as the hooves  slam into you leaving these frozen cracks where the blood should be emanating from 
none	 it seals the  wound almost  travis 14 so i reduce that by 14  matt correct reduce that by 14 and then make your retaliatory strike  travis great weapon master reckless  matt go for it  travis 26  matt that hits  travis 22  laura plus ten  travis 32  matt 32 points of damage how do you want to do this  cheering  marisha yeah grog get me that staff  travis when he jumped up and did the hoof kick down im going to take it and then grab his 
none	  hooves and wishbone him  cheering  matt as you grab him you try to begin to pull and he slams onto the ground and you see him grab  his arms back to try and pull himself back up you kick him straight down again and as you laugh  you push your foot into his crotch area as you pull yenk in half with a sheer show of strength  smearing you with black burning blood it does burn you you do suffer five points of fire damage  as the blood thats spurting on you is 
none	 burning into the skin you tear him mostly in half you  can see the innards spilling into the snow and melting the snow within a fivefoot radius of you  as he death rattle is still surviving as you pull him apart as you get closer he reaches  forward and grabs you and palms your head with his last bit of strength and begins to squeeze and  then the fingers eventually go lax before the hand impact onto the ground  travis i look at both of the legs in my hands and i look at kima 
none	 and go which ones lucky  matt she goes you are  laughter  matt that ends yenks turn  sam hey matt can i rewind  matt no sorry yenk is done and torn open on the ground  marisha now we have to deal with the two dragons  laura well one hopefully  taliesin yeah were going to let one leave ones going to walk  matt vorugal is going to go ahead and whoosh come up and then  sam does pike get an attack of opportunity  matt pike is not currently threatening him yeah

none	 we do a lot of rolls in these big fights  travis we do but a straight 20 to one flipflop only happens one time  sam 29  marisha thats pretty good thats okay  matt explosion the explosion hits you see it sends ice shards shooting everywhere leaving a  big crater on the ground where the snow once was and part of the stonework is barely scratched the  blast hits vorugal and vorugal grunts looks down at the two unconscious bodies on the ground  looks up at raishan huffs does that end your turn  
none	 sam yes  matt end of your turn its going to use two actions to do a wing attack beating its wings  hitting every creature within 15 feet youre out of range actually marisha grog i need you to  make a dexterity saving throw  travis i think i have advantage on this because of rage i do 21  matt 21 that unfortunately fails you take 15 points of bludgeoning damage and youre knocked  prone also pike and vax you both fail a death saving throw from the bludgeoning winds of the ice  dragons wings 
none	 beating downward  marisha you guys are at two failed  laura hes at two failed pikes at one  matt vorugal is going to head upward and begin flying this direction to turn tail and flee  sam do you get an attack because hes flying by you  marisha yeah do i get an attack of opportunity here  sam you are right over him  matt you were right over him as he gets up ill give you one i dont have any more of these  things here  liam blow everything youve got blow it

none	 for now vex youre up  laura okay im going to hit him twice  marisha fucking burn this guy down  taliesin hit him with everything weve got  laura 27  matt 27 hits  laura 25 on the first  matt 25 damage all right and the second hit  laura the second is also 27  matt how do you want to do this  cheering  marisha were going to live  laura oh my god  matt hes taking away and you have a shot as its arcing to the right of you bleeding 
none	 and  limping in the air but managing to pick up speed the sleet and snow is strong and firing around you  laura i want to see a cut on his stomach where yenk left a hole and i want to go straight into  his heart  matt the first arrow you aim for it it streaks off and hits another wound and gets jammed in you  pull back with the second arrow and right as you see the snow beginning to blind the one moment of  clarity that hits you arrow firing you release the 
none	 arrow piercing inside where the wound was  where one of yenks horns had gashed into the front of his chest vorugal roars and spins into  a corkscrew plummets and crashes into the side of the ravine tumbles backward rocks come tumbling  onto it vorugal hits the ground smacked open as it begins to get back up impacts a bunch of  rocks slam down and one big shard of ice impacts slams into it panting still writhing  in place as hes bleeding out  laura and a tree grows out of his guts  matt hes 
none	 still currently holding on as hes jammed to the ground you see the bluishpurple  blood leaking out the side of the mouth panting it cant move and you can see the strength  leaving vorugals body raishan swoops up next to vorugals corpse leaning over cackles tell  your master on the other side when you see him that it was worth it and raishan sinks her teeth  into his throat and tears it out you see the spray of blood across raishans mouth and across  the front of the ravine as vorugals body falls limp onto 
none	 the ground spits the chunk of white  dragon flesh onto the bottom of the ravine the green dragon spins around facing you all well  done and backs into a sitting position the wings furl down and fold into her side take your  spoils it seems the war is nigh  taliesin there will be a conversation  travis i run as fast as i can over to pike and vax  taliesin i run to the body of the big demonic thing and start going through it  matt okay roll an investigation check  travis i 
none	 have two basic potions i decork both of them and shove them in their gullets  matt while thats happening in the time it takes you guys to rush over i need you both to make one  more death saving throw  marisha oh fuck come on you guys  liam a ten and a three  laughter  taliesin not funny  ashley 11  matt grog comes by scoops you both up and forcefeeds you two basic healing potions you  both come to consciousness bruised beaten but apparently the current struggle is done though  youre 
none	 now shivering cold soaked through all of you the elements have really sunk in once the  adrenaline begins to wear off  laura i fly down and cast cure wounds on vax  travis the two of you inside the mansion now  matt how much do your potions heal for them its 1d4 plus four sorry 2d4 plus two  marisha yes we do  taliesin vex we have a dragon to disassemble  marisha you go im the one whos good at harvesting  travis six  matt plus two eight you heal eight vax  travis

none	 swollen and looks to have this weird black pulsing mass that surrounds it  like its infected perpetually  taliesin i pull out my sword and cut it out  matt as you pull it back you can see there are actual vines and ivy that have begun to grow  inside its abdomen you tear back and pull it and as soon as you cut back the rest of the muscle  thats currently tensing it in the muscle almost instinctually pulls back all the tension lost  and it almost fires this stafflike entity out it shoots outward 
none	 and you have to dodge to the side  immediately you see that its strangely pristine amongst all the crimson and gore the blood of  this creature does not even touch its surface a twisted series of clumpedtogether thorny vines  that form this curvature at the top a singular yellowishgreen gem in the center that hovers  locked in place by no noticeable force its there jutting out of the body of the creature  marisha i run to percy  taliesin i walk to you were walking to the dragon anyway i hand it to you your 
none	 majesty  laura i land next to them oh my god lets get inside  offscreen clatter  marisha thats right  taliesin karmas a bitch  liam vorugal aint shit  matt you all rush into the inside of the mansion  marisha i dont immediately  taliesin were finishing up the harvesting and i go to talk to raishan really quickly  laura i stay out and i search more around yenk  taliesin im sending you to work on the dragon  marisha im coming with you to have that conversation  taliesin okay  marisha im

none	 see a sudden glyph appear beneath and vanishes  taliesin that was not a fight we were about to have  marisha sighs heavily i silently go and start harvesting the white dragon  laura did you see how weak she was compared to vorugal  marisha lets just hope she stays that way i start harvesting the white dragon as much as i can  liam im going to find larkin  sam send up a signal flare  laura i take an empty potion bottle out and get some of yenks blood and put it in the cold 
none	  matt okay as youre doing that too youre noticing that yenks body is rapidly decomposing  its form is dissolving from the inside  marisha i try as fast as i can wait from who  taliesin im going to run over and try and pull anything from yenk  matt i figure for the fact that its near midnight we can begin next game working out the  logistics of what youve managed to harvest with the rolls and such well pick up from here next time that  was intense guys well done  marisha oh my
