none	 a couple  of years and that has nothing to do with us other than the fact that im probably going to be  at full mast for the next week thinking of that possibility  travis said so casually  laura yeah  matt im so excited please dont fuck it up  travis they will itll be mark wahlberg  matt no no no  marisha channing tatum  liam will ferrell  matt i will i would not  marisha channing tatum is geralt of rivia  laura done lets make this happen  matt dont guys 
town	 i will stop this show your dm is out if channing tatum becomes geralt i will  be so furious hes great at certain roles i loved him in i absolutely adored him in the 21  jump street movies  sam i guess hes not coming on our show jeez  matt thats enough of our silly talk lets go ahead and dive into the chaos that is the current  circumstance keep in mind the culmination of leading into halloween with this story arc and now  going and starting a rebellion in whitestone on the fifth of 
none	 november has been a very delightful  unintentional coordination here  taliesin i almost wore my special spider belt too but it felt too weird  matt so thats pretty cool so to get you guys up to speed with the circumstance that has  happened those especially that are tuning in for the first time a couple known as the briarwoods  that took over the city of whitestone five years before murdering most of the ruling family of percy  other than himself escaping have recently been doing political discussions with the home city of  emon vox 
town	 machina our troop of intrepid adventurers upon discovering this battled them  at emon they fled to whitestone and the party has then gone after to seek to destroy them and  free the town the oncehome to percival  in the process it appears that there have been a number of warnings set and the entire town has been long  held under this dark ominous rule that they have kept at bay apparently they have found notes of  previous failed rebellions and things that die here dont seem to stay dead a number of  zombified giants 
town	 are wandering the city as these giant lurching sentinels and apparently a number  of the cutthroats that helped the briarwoods come to power in this town have now been given titles  and land here and are now called the new nobles by the locals  during this process you guys managed to sneak into the town began setting out word of coming  rebellion and that percival de rolo has returned and the briarwoods time is numbered upon meeting  the previous chancellor to your father of the town archibald you guys came to an  understanding and 
town	 he was going to reach out to all of his contacts and let them know that the  rebellion is happening you guys then set out to set a twopronged attack against two of the  remaining new nobles in the town most of the party going to seek the outside of count whats  his name  travis and laura count dooku  marisha count duke  matt duke vedmeyer was the one that scanlan went to and then tylieri is the one that the rest of  you wandered outside now as the rain pours down into the 
none	 city midday scanlan decided to open  from a polymorph spell as a fly to the top of the front doorstep of vedmeyers home then  proceeding to unpolymorph and repolymorph into a triceratops of which i have your statistics here  for your triceratops form if you want to come get that  marisha go get them stats boy  taliesin and marisha chanting stats stats stats  matt so thats your triceratops form after becoming a triceratops you squashed the front  guard that was there you slammed through the front of the building destroying the front door 
none	  and we cut to the other group who is stealthing through the rain at which point the okay was  given to grog whether intentionally or not grog then charged to the front door of tylieris  estate and the rest of you prepared for impact and that was where we left off in the center of  this chaos  liam lets do this  laura oh god  matt so without further ado sam  sam but i was just handed this  matt i know take a look  travis sucks to be first  liam 
none	 hes got the maps out already get your shit together man  sam ive never been a triceratops before  liam thats not what i heard  sam all right youre right think like a triceratops so i need shelter i dont know how do  triceratopses think  taliesin probably like punk rock hippopotamuses  sam hiphopipotimi  matt say for the sake of this for now well go through your circumstance as they are separate  so scanlan you are i did not have a triceratops but i did have a stegosaurus its  the same size im 
none	 sorry bloodspike behemoth  taliesin thats kind of racist  matt im sorry you know what theyre not around to argue  travis that you know of  taliesin we are going to get a bunch of angry tweets from stegosauruses and triceratops  matt im sure please bring them my way as you slam your way into the front of duke vedmeyers  estate pieces of wood blasting outward scattering among the center of the foyer you see  before you a rising staircase that divides into two separate staircases that curl around to the  second level  
none	 sam lovely decor  matt you also notice that the entire interior is currently filled with guards all  seemingly prepared and almost expecting your arrival  sam i think i can take them guys i think i can take them  matt you also see at the top duke vedmeyer himself a large hairless greyskinned goliath  wielding a giant twohanded sword armored with a breastplate  marisha vecmeyer  matt vedmeyer  laura hes a goliath  matt hes a goliath yeah  marisha vedmeyer is a goliath  sam wow thats going to be fun later but 
none	 not right now okay do i know so lets assess my  knowledge real quick i know about him a little bit he is one of the thugs that came into the city  matt correct  sam he is not a magicwielder as far as i know  matt as far as you know no and at first glance based on the fact that he is wearing heavy  breastplate and is wielding a giant twohanded sword you get the feeling he is probably not as  heavily inclined towards the arcane arts as others you have encountered  
none	 sam as i quickly survey the room do i see anyone else who is a threat greater than a heavily armed  guard anything that is a creepy wizard or a weird old mage  matt currently no currently all you see are a series of whitestone guards in uniform armor all  with heavy crossbows currently nocked and as you come blasting through the door they are already  arranged in what appears to be a waiting pattern should anything try and charge its way into the house  sam so theyll probably all shoot me wont they  
none	 matt in fact roll initiative  sam so directly in front of me theres a staircase going up  matt yep  sam any other doors or exits  matt there are doors on each side that are currently locked and other than that no  sam those are locked doors  matt they are closed currently and they appear to be theres a giant wooden beam crossed over  the front of each then theres the outside which leads to the exterior to the raining outside of  the household and the stairs that go up  sam oh 
none	 man  matt roll initiative  sam initiative dont i get a surprise round doesnt matter 21  matt okay  sam i dont get a surprise round because i sprung in there  matt apparently not  sam damn it  matt you made a very loud noise when you turned into a triceratops and tore through the front of  the household all right so scanlan is up first  sam so heres the thing heres the thing i should probably leave  travis yeah come on  sam but come on im a triceratops ive got to 
none	 have some fun first right  travis you can take a couple of hit points right  sam right  taliesin i think you revert back to normal  marisha does polymorph carry over  matt if you go to zero hit points in animal form you go back to your regular full health and any  damage that carries over just goes to your regular health at that point  laura thats a lot of people  marisha you have 115 hit points  matt you guys arent there scanlan what are you doing  travis sings jurassic park 
none	 theme  others join in  matt what are you doing  sam wait its my turn first  matt yeah you have initiative man  sam i beat them with initiative  matt you did  sam they are more than my charging distance as a triceratops right  matt hes the only one thats within technically whats your speed  sam 40  matt 40 you would get right up to vedmeyer if you were to charge  sam i would be dead  travis no you wouldnt you got it go stick him  matt what do 
none	 you want to do  sam im going to go how far away are the doors on the sides  matt over here its about 35 feet  sam im going to turn right and blast through that door  laughter  matt okay  sam oh shit it could be trapped well well find out  liam expect the unexpected with scanlan shorthalt  matt he goes blasting through the doors  sam do i have to roll to blast through the doors  matt we are going to find out yeah go ahead and roll a strength check 
none	 roll a d20 and add your  strength modifier of the triceratops form  sam okay strength modifier says plus five so thats only a 17  laura for a door  sam me and doors dont get along too well  matt you running slam your head in through the horns protruding and tearing through  the wood the doors break inward but the doors dont fully blast inward  sam the door beat me  matt the door is in bad shape it wont take much more power to blast through  sam these fucking doors  matt 
none	 its now your worst nemesis  sam so now i am stuck in a door  matt you could try and pull back out you manage to pull out without an issue the doors are mostly  beaten inward it will take but a small impact to blast through next turn if you wanted to  sam next turn do i still have an action after this  matt that would have been your action  travis youre great youre money youre good  laura every single one of those guys can attack you now  sam yeah but it 
none	 probably wont happen  travis maybe they didnt see you  laura run away  sam its not my turn anymore right thats it  matt thats your turn  laura no  sam my triceratops ass is sticking out  matt just right there  travis look theyre all dummies theyre just mannequins  matt this guy moves up over the railing with his heavy crossbow and aims this way these guys all  shift to this side with their crossbows  sam im going to die  matt over here this guys going to move to this point 
none	 so he can get a view of you and vedmeyer is  going to move down here and get his sword ready grinning as he holds his sword up he puts his  hand up and goes aim fire a bunch of crossbow bolts get loosed at once shh shh through the  middle of the room whats your armor class as the triceratops  sam i have no idea 14  matt 11 that misses thats a 13 misses  sam wow these guys suck  taliesin they are like stormtroopers  matt natural one  taliesin they are 
none	 you are being attacked by stormtroopers  matt thats going to be a 14 hits 18 hits 24 hits that was six  sam that was six  travis three hits  matt one more thats a 22 so i have four that actually hit you with the crossbow bolts  taliesin youre fine  sam yeah  travis youre now a porcupine triceratops  laura you have 115 hit points  sam i have 115 hit points  taliesin and when those go out you are back to human hit points  matt thats eight piercing damage 13 piercing 
none	 damage 21  laura are you immune to any kind of damage  matt 25 34 points of piercing damage from this  volley  liam is there resistance to anything on there  matt nope  sam what does that take me down to 81 is that right 115 minus 34 81  taliesin sounds about right  sam okay  matt all right that brings us back to the top of the initiative round and youre up  sam well shit then ive got to get some retribution  travis totally turn around and give it to them 
tavern	  sam am i considered flanked  matt you are not  sam damn it  travis you do have a tail  sam i do have a tail  marisha you are like a drunk guy at a craps table  sam i dont know how to hit things ive never hit things before  liam theres the door you mangled in front of you  sam okay im going to gore that guy to my left  matt he is above you on the railing  sam oh thats a balcony i thought that was a stairway down 
none	  matt im sorry this is a balcony up top so hes actually aiming down and firing at you  laura then just go through the door  sam im going through the door  matt all right then roll another strength check  sam yeah because im not tangling with duke vedmeyer or whatever 23  matt 23 not a problem you burst through  taliesin were going off the map  liam hey you guys  marisha hes taking them off the grid  taliesin and marisha he doesnt have a social security number  matt so what 
none	 you see in here as you blast through its a dining room with a central dining  room table two small tables in the far corners there is a tenfoot window across the way it  appears to be a normal dining room set  sam is that my action  matt that is your movement  sam thats my movement  matt yeah id say at this point it is so damaged that it doesnt take much effort to push through  so you can manage to push through as part of your movement  sam okay  taliesin 
none	 you could pick em off as they run through im not helping im sorry  matt nope you guys arent there  taliesin not there shutting up  sam whispers i should get out of there but its so fun  matt what do you want to do scanlan  sam so i am in the room no one is in there with me  matt correct  sam so wheres this laser pointer  taliesin you can also hold your action just as an option not to help but you can hold your action  sam so yeah ill 
none	 just position myself right next to the the door there and i will hold my  attack until anyone runs through the door they get an instagore  matt okay good to know holding an action the next turn will be vedmeyer  sam oh shit here he comes here he comes its me and the big guy  matt holds up there he is going to wait there hes actually going to dash and just get up right  next to where the doors are burst open he can hear you right around the corner the rest of  
none	 these guys are going to dash in  sam oh god i think i can take them guys  matt there there there this guy is going to just try and jump down lets see if he makes his  acrobatics he does not with his armor he leaps off the edge and manages to damage his ankle and  is currently prone on the ground that ends their turn back at the top are you still holding your  action on your turn now its back to you  sam okay tell me this did i hear a bunch 
none	 of footsteps can i hear  matt you heard a bunch of footsteps coming in yeah  sam sighs all right im not good at fighting i will  laura can you set a blaze  sam i dont have any fire i dont know why i was sent into this mission i dont do fire things i  will drop my form is that an action  laura you have a lantern  matt you can drop it in a moment  marisha dont you have a torch  matt the triceratops shrinks down to gnomish form now in 
none	 this partially destroyed dining room area  what are you doing  sam im going to hold on  marisha how did this plan happen then  travis because were a bunch of slapdicks thats why  marisha why didnt you say i dont have fire i said hey scanlan i should come with you and  you said i can take care of myself how many times do i have to tell you guys i dont need  your help  matt the echoing voice you hear in the back of your mind as you imagine this is what 
none	 keyleth  would be saying right now  marisha doritos a failure you guys  sam yeah okay i peek around the corner a little bit just make sure theyre all there and i will  stinking cloud all of them  matt okay  liam why are you not dimension dooring out of there  sam ive got to have some fun first how often am i going to take on a whole house by myself  travis i like it im so in love with you right now  taliesin i approve of this plan  matt all 
none	 right 20foot radius sphere id say you could affect all of them yeah all of them in  this big ol stinking cloud radius not a worry this whole area fills up with gas all right all  of a sudden the entire foyer just fills up with this greenish noxious cloud of poisonous gas  lets see they have to make a constitution save  liam get the goliath get that goliath  matt whats the dc is this through your hand cone  sam oh for sure it is so 19  matt laughing 19 jesus christ okay 
none	 nope nope nope nope natural 20 hes fine 19 hes  fine 18 nope nope double nope because hes on the ground fuck that guy vedmeyer rolls a one  cheering  matt all right so these two guys immediately cover their mouths and pull up this little bit of  material they have around their chest plate armor to cover their mouth the rest of them start  coughs hacking up one of them starts vomiting all over the ground and he has a helmet on so its  straining through its awful  groaning  matt vedmeyer himself 
none	 kind of backs against the wall and groans just tries to get it to leave  the area but its just this thick cloud its slowly moving away yeah they are in a bad  place right now okay and you still have movement you have only moved five feet so far  travis is stinking cloud methanebased  sam laughs it is the way i do it i can still move  matt yeah you only moved five feet so far so you still have 20 feet of movement  sam okay ill do a dukes of hazzard over

none	 none of your allies were around to actually  witness it but you heard the theme music  sam okay yes so im near the window now right  matt yeah youre right by the window  sam okay and thats i guess everything right  matt yeah  sam okay  matt okay your turn ends vedmeyer is just you can see his eyes are filling up with liquid he  does make his saving throw he coughs coughs manages to clear the air around him you can see  the cloud slowly moving back this way away from 
none	 where it was cast that finishes his turn  however he is no longer affected by the stinking cloud you can see as the cloud slowly moves past  him and his face comes through his pupilless angry goliath eyes are staring at you from across  the room to where the doors are open you see him grit his teeth and growls you can hear his  teeth scratching across themselves in anger and fury  sam im shaking  matt the rest of them are going to go these two guys are going to move forward they both 
none	 come  running in putting another bolt into their crossbows clicking pulling it back real fast  pulling up their heavy crossbows and firing at you that is going to be a 24  sam well that hits of course it does  matt and an 18  sam against what  laura your ac  sam oh yeah that hits  matt so you take 12 points of piercing damage from the first bolt and five points of piercing  damage from the second as both zoomf zoomf bolts one hits you in the shoulder and ricochets  off 
none	 not doing much damage the other one slams and actually embeds itself into your thigh about  an inch into it its piercing and sticking out the other side mostly caught armor  but you can feel it definitely got a chunk of flesh in the process  laura oh no  sam okay  matt that ends their turn the rest of these guys now are going to try and make their saving  throw fail fail fail no success on him actually he rolled a 19 a success on a natural  19 fail fail well no actually 
none	 these three succeed the rest of them are still down so ill  say that these guys here are all down and hes still up these two are still down okay that  ends their turn youre up  sam i so want to get some payback but i shouldnt right  liam gtfo  sam i think i can take these guys  matt that is a hell of a lightning bolt line right there  sam how big is that diameter  matt its about six feet across  sam oh i cant lift that thing  matt 
none	 no its a big long table you have a very wide line of individuals right there all ready  to snatch you  sam all right one more round what do you say guys  travis and liam were not here  sam one more round i am going to fuck do i have lineofsight on the door  matt the door is right here so youre by the window so if you wanted to move over here then  you would have line of sight on pretty much everybody  sam yeah that would be so fun  taliesin 
none	 you could move and then move back im only helping with gameplay strategy  sam he could brain me  travis he could  sam he could brain me in one shot okay i will duck under the table so they think thats where i  went and then dimension door to the roof  matt okay you duck under the table im going to say make a deception roll to try and successfully  feint them  sam oh okay  liam can they see the top of his head behind the table  matt from their direction its 
none	 kind of hard especially because theres a table and chairs up  against it and part of it has been crushed by a triceratops that was previously here  liam oh im going under the table  taliesin sentences you never expect to hear in your dd game  sam 31  matt so you grab your head oh no do a very elaborate dive under the table  sam here i go under the table  matt a little strange dull thud of arcane energy as you bamf up to the ceiling  sam okay great  taliesin he 
none	 is reaching under the table ladies and gentlemen  laura i know what does this mean oh okay  matt all right is that your turn you are now up on the rooftop theres rain pouring down you  are immediately soaked from the heavy storm thats now coming into whitestone  sam yeah its just me up here  matt just you up there yeah  sam okay i will go invisible and just hang and just see what happens  matt okay easy enough to do because it will take a round for anyone to recover from that 
none	  anyway because you have to use your action both turns so as you are waiting up there you cast  invisibility on yourself and wait  sam and then i start digging through my pockets  if i have any flint or firemaking apparatus at all  matt check your equipment  sam i will i will look  marisha do you have an adventurers kit  sam nope i have some poison  matt poison the house there you go thatll work  travis we are the best planners ever  matt i know you guys are rocking 
dung	 it  sam oh wait i do have something  laura yeah you do  sam i have a potion of fire breath  matt you do  marisha okay  laura its raining up there  sam well but its a potion i dont know how it works  matt youre checking your pockets you find the potion you look down and you notice even through  the storm you can see in the distance theres the dark shape of a giant lumbering zombie guard  making its way down to this part of the town what are you 
none	 doing  sam so im on a roof thats all soaking wet right  matt yeah  sam theres no crawl space access no attic i can get to  matt make a perception check  sam okay whoa nothing two  matt two this is a pretty solid roof with apparently no entry point at any points the  craftsmanship is flawless  sam okay you know what ill just try it i will fire breath potion myself  matt okay you pull up boink pull the cork off glug glug  sam i dont know what this thing 
none	 does ive just got this  matt as you feel the fluid find its way down your esophagus it warms it like a fine whiskey would  but the warmth just grows and grows to the point where its almost too hot but it never quite  reaches a point where its painful but you feel as if this need to belch is burbling within your  stomach and at any given point in time you could let that belch fly forward  sam okay and am i close to the entry point roof the roof of the entry point 
town	  matt where you came in  sam can i get over there  matt yeah you just come running across the rooftop its a little bit of up and down as the  topography happens and as youre running you start hearing voices shouting out in the street  you make your way over to the top of the roof above  sam okay so im just going to lean over the side and scorch the whole front entrance as much as i  can from where i am  matt okay as you grunts let the belch out 
none	 it comes out in a large spray of orange yellow and  red flames that immediately burst beneath the overhang which  sam by the way im also invisible right  matt you are no longer unfortunately when you do an attack of some kind the invisibility is  released so this gnome appears soaking wet over the edge of the roof and then releases this gout of  fire that blankets the front of the building catching flames on all the portions of the front  part of the second and parts of the first story including the top 
town	 of the entryway that you had  already smashed through as a triceratops which exposed a lot of dried wood it immediately bursts  into flame as you complete that breath and you inhale for a second you hear voices now starting  to shout from the inside of the house muffled shouting you cant really make out the noises  but it sounds like theres panic now starting to hit from the inside and you see a few guards  start rushing out into the street to try and look at where the source of the flames came from 
none	 they  both look up and see you  sam oh great wait these are guards who are outside yeah  matt these are guards who were inside the house that as soon as the fire came shooting down and  burned the house they rush out look up grab their crossbows and aim them up towards you  travis just your hands and head are sticking over  matt thats a 17  sam that hits  matt and a 13  taliesin doesnt he have at least halfcover from the roof  matt he does actually  sam

none	 getting a little bit of water but there is  still a number of dry wood exposed by the immediate overhang that it does manage to catch  and the flames are beginning to burn up and collect on the sides because it is superheated  flame both sides of the house now appear to be on fire looking over your shoulder you can see now  there is a pillar of black smoke rising up from the front of the building you do see on the  opposite side a hatch click bam slam open and you see a

none	 plummets backward off the side of the roof and  you wait a second to hear a boof across the way thats full damage there mutters okay he  takes 34 points of falling damage and is knocked prone  liam you cant get this on network television ladies and gentlemen  matt so youre now standing alone on the rooftop your bigby hand there next to you a little  trickle of fire curling at the corner of your mouth from your final dragons breath when you  decide to use it what are you going to do

town	 right near where the street is and you  can see to your right its open towards the direction of where the rest of the party is to  the left you can see now coming through the rain about a hundred feet from you a giant hulking  zombie giant thats stomping towards you as you notice that you see a number of figures come  swarming out of the two buildings to the side of it and immediately start attacking the zombie giant  travis and liam go go get out  marisha theyre attacking the  laura

none	 now fire is licking out of every single window and glass is steadily breaking over  time crash crash the guards have all escaped out and you can see the guards and vedmeyer are  now storming across the entire grounds hes giving orders left and right and theyre all out  searching for you in the nearby vicinity of the home  looking across the way you can see the zombie giant is now currently reaching down and swapping  down you can get a closer view they look like some of the normal inhabitants here are wearing  
none	 makeshift armor weapons that they have and they are now rising up and attempting to take down this  zombie giant you watch as it reaches out it slams and smashes one to the ground leaving him  lifeless while another two leap up on the back of the zombie giant and are stabbing it with spears  and you see it moaning it gives out this roar its hard to tell from this distance which side is  getting any ground but it is currently held up by this group of about ten individuals that are  attacking it 
none	 at once  sam its cool  marisha thats so cool  matt you just going to stay there and wait it out  sam i think ill wait it out if im in a relatively safe place because i cant really do  anything for you guys anyway youre on your own  matt okay well use that to hop over to the other party  sam oh im taking a short rest  laura oh thats good yes  matt a short rest is about half an hour to 40 minutes of waiting so you might want to

none	  travis and theyre all up on the second floor right  matt right thats your go so bringing us to count tylieris turn count tylieri who is  currently looking over the banister he kind of steps forward here for a second grog this works  for you because you look up and see all the guards there tylieri walks up this rotundlooking  slimy individual thinning hair very pale skin a little bit of facial hair that has never really  seemed to grow fully in but he tries to groom the best he can  laura grogs 
none	 beard is better than that  matt oh much better hes wearing fine clothing hes got rings encrusting his fingers but he  walks with a deftness to the edge of this stairway and looks over and says interesting i figured  thered be more of you  travis interesting theres a lot of dead men up there  matt laughs of which you see him leap up onto the ceiling pshh stick to it and begin to  skittering noise scatter across  laura the one with the shitty beard  matt yep  marisha tylieri  matt yep 
none	  sam hes spiderman  matt he jumps up and spidercrawls across the ceiling and then drops down yeah with deft  acrobatic feats he leaps across drops and lands right in front of you you can see now in his  face as slovenly as it is there is a look of deathly hunger in his eyes and fangs bared from  under his lips  travis thats a neat trick  matt he is now going to make two melee attacks against you thats a natural 20 with the claw  and the other ones going to be 
none	 a 15 i dont think its going to hit  travis no  matt so he now has these long claws in his hand the first one whoosh it catches you off guard  from the sheer weird assault that hes brought to you  travis whats wrong with you  matt laughs you take 16 points of slashing damage whoosh from the first arc and he goes up  with the second hand and this time you grunt pull out of the way his hand manages to knock  some of the bolts free that were jammed in your 
none	 chest  travis half the 16 right  matt half of 16 correct  travis so eight  matt because youre raging so eight on that one thats his go and he just grins at you with this  hissing sound licking his fanged lips that ends his turn that brings us to grog youre up  travis growls i go into a frenzied rage and i use reckless attack along with my great weapon  master and i turn that thing into a piece of goo with my war hammer  laughter  matt okay war hammer fwoosh bursts 
none	 into flames your eyes all of a sudden go into an  intense glare as you rear up and go into your frenzied rage make your attacks do it  travis advantage on them thats much better thats 24  matt 24 hits on the first strike you only have advantage on the first attack  travis oh gotcha okay just the first one  matt yeah the first ones a reckless strike  travis okay 21  matt hits as well  travis and 20  matt all three hit  travis yes okay  matt thats with the 
none	 minus five right  marisha great weapon master  matt because of great weapon master it would be minus five to each attack  travis no  matt all right so the last one was 15  travis yes  matt last one misses  travis okay  matt but the first two do hit  travis okay i forgot that part know your rules kids  laura then you add a ten to all of them  travis 21 for the first one  matt 21 points of damage  travis and 20 for the second one and the 
none	 third one misses right  matt thats with the fire right  travis thats with the fire  matt yeah third one misses so 41 points of damage to him with the first two whack whack  the impacts slamming into him you can see his body get pushed back with each impact hes still  taking it and grinning at you but hes also seemingly surprised by the ferocity of the  strikes is that your turn are you going to move  travis thats it no im not going to move  matt okay hes going to use 
none	 one of his legendary actions to at the end of your turn reach out and  attack you again thats going to be a 23 to hit  travis yep  matt instead of attacking hes going to grapple you  travis okay  matt so his claw goes up and actually fwoosh reaches into your throat and you can feel the  claws digging into the flesh its a very very firm grip and he has you right where he wants you  travis work that hand out a lot do you  matt thats that action there all 
none	 right that brings us to the guards the guards all reload  their crossbow bolts move in these three now see the bear in the back and theyre going to fire on  trinket these seven are all going to fire on grog now that hes held there so the three  against trinket thats going to be a 16  laura doesnt hit  matt thats going to be a 20  laura hits  matt and a 22  laura yeah  matt so trinket takes six points of piercing damage and 11 points of piercing damage total 
none	 of  17 points of damage to trinket as two bolts shink shink one of them bounces off the armor  one actually sticks and trinket growls but its not enough to really cause much of a worry  laura yeah he doesnt care  matt the other seven against you grog natural 20 natural one thats not going to hit thats a  natural five 18  travis misses  matt natural one thats a 19 that hits a 19 naturally so its 27 one more thats 18 to hit  travis misses  matt oh these all have 
dung	 advantage on you because you did a reckless attack  travis thats right i did  matt so the one that would have missed is a natural 20  travis nay  matt that does hit natural 20 again  marisha what  matt im rolling for all the ones that would have missed  sam why do they have advantage on you  travis because i had advantage on mine  matt yeah reckless attack  sam thats reckless  travis laughs it is very reckless  matt they all hit you three of which are crits  travis 
none	 sarcastically yay  marisha son of a bitch  matt first crit is 19 points of piercing damage  liam flatly merry critmas  laura were all going to die  matt the second crit is going to be nine points of piercing damage  travis okay  matt last one is going to be another nine points of piercing damage  travis okay 37 halved  matt actually that would be 15 total because that was a crit so the three crits are out of the way  travis okay 37 so 15 total  matt 15 on the 
none	 last one yeah  travis okay  matt and so those are the three crits  travis 33 whats half of 33  laura 16  liam 16 or 17 16  matt there you go so thats that and the next ones are 11 another 11  taliesin were going to have to thin these ranks out quickly  matt ten and seven so you take another 39 points of piercing damage after that  travis okay im going to use my stones endurance to get rid of that stank  matt one of them yeah  travis roll 
none	 plus my constitution 16  matt okay so well say you reduce one of the crits from 16 the first one take 15 points off  that because i think one of the crits was 15 well say you used it on that one thats 39  points of piercing damage reduced by half that will put you at 18  travis 18 okay  matt well say you take 18 points of piercing damage from those four noncrits  travis okay  matt so yeah that ends the guards volley that brings us to vex youre up  laura 
none	 me and trinket  matt yes and trinket both  laura okay so i run in after percy and my brother  matt okay  laura and trinket  matt are you going to dash because you can move you can double move using your action to move if  you want  laura oh i can  matt yeah unless you want to use your action to yell out for trinket to attack in which case you  can give trinket a round of combat  laura oh i do want to give trinket a round of combat so

none	  taliesin trying everything i can to save this bear  matt i know you man its okay  laughter  laura trinket then comes out of cannonball and tries to bite the back of the vampires neck  matt okay ill let you do that because this is your full round to do that usually you would  choose to cannonball  laura or i do my two attacks  matt but because you arent part of this combat fray and youre giving all of your round to him  ill let you do it sure  laura okay

none	 up your eyes begin to go black again the smoke pouring out from the  corner of it smoke begins to pour out of the midsection of the guard who looks confused for a  second and it swirls around him as part of the hex that has him marked as you release your next  three blasts  taliesin okay this is with sharpshooter  matt okay  taliesin that sucks ten  matt ten misses first shot just ricochet noise goes wide blasting a chunk out of the upstairs  hallway  taliesin 11  matt 11 also

none	 jowls shake from the impact of the dagger blow and he looks down angrily at you fangs  bared as the two other attacks hit his side  liam yeah im looking him right in the eye as i do that too  matt at the end of your turn he uses two of his legendary actions  liam im wearing my helmet my shiny helmet  matt i know to look at you reach up with the throat that hes grasped and sink his fangs  directly into your throat grog  travis angry noise i have a little 
none	 collar does that help at all  matt not in this moment you have a big neck very big neck and a very tiny collar laughs  that will be a 20 to hit  travis yep  matt all righty so you take nine points of piercing damage  travis is that halved  matt that is halved yeah so say five round up  travis sure  matt however you do take 14 points of necrotic damage that is not reduced but your maximum hit  points are now reduced by 14  travis got it  matt 
none	 as you feel that same similar cold feeling as the life bloods being drained out of your body  and you see his eyes cresting at you with this wild glare that ends your turn vax  liam yeah thats it  matt it is now his turn  sam spiderman  matt yeah now hes taking his turn hes now going to go ahead and make another bite attack on  you again as he pulls back and reaches his forearm and grabs the other side of your throat  going for the other side of the jugular  
none	 travis isnt this a grog buffet  matt thats a natural one though  cheering  sam oh because youve got your necklace on  matt however he does have advantage on you because you used your reckless strike  sam never use reckless strike again  liam doesnt it cancel out after one roll advantage versus disadvantage is one roll right  travis it ended on the first attack right  matt it was a one on the first attack yeah its until your next turn attacks against you get  advantage  travis oh i thought his first 
none	 bite was the first one  sam wait so all attacks even followup attacks get advantage even though he only gets advantage  on the first one  matt ill read it for you right now its a cool ability when youre not the only tank in the room  sam no it is not its the worst ability ever  laura its a good ability if youre only fighting one person  matt yeah but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn  liam because hes out of it hes going cuckoo  sam wait did 
none	 you not have jesus never use that thing again  travis im using it every time  laughter  matt doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using strength during this turn so  yes i apologize it does give you advantage on all of your attacks i misread that  travis quietly oh shitfuck louder thats okay thats okay  liam stuff happens give him a bonus 15 hp or something  matt thats okay yeah its fine but going forward good to know so it does give you  advantage on all of your attacks 
none	  travis copy that  matt its the first attack is the one that confused me on the way it was worded sorry  folks i know better now but for that i say the one stands as retribution for me forgetting the rule  cheering  matt so he goes in to strike for the bite this time however he does manage to catch the  chainmail coif that scanlan had made you his fangs get caught on the chain grunts  travis like making out with braces  matt he pulls away releases you no doesnt release you 
none	 as hes holding you there hes going  to go ahead and make a claw strike across your face two and oh thatll be a 19  travis that does hit  matt he does hit okay you take eight points of slashing damage reduced to four because of your  rage that ends his turn grog youre up now  travis am i still grappled  matt youre still grappled yeah  travis id like to try and break the grapple  matt okay so you use your action to try and break the grapple so athletics roll of 
none	  travis 22  matt yeah you boof just shove him off without a problem  travis awesome  matt you still have your bonus action to strike if you like  travis can i use my bonus action to try and grapple him back  matt not as a bonus action unfortunately its an action to do that  travis i will attack yeah just one right whoosh  matt one strike yeah  travis okay fuck yes 21  matt 21 does hit yeah  travis awesome and that is badass nine 17 22 22 with the fire 
none	 damage  matt 22 damage all right whack and youre watching as he does all these actions you see  his body begin to reform and the wounds beginning to heal themselves in the vampiric manner but as  soon as that wound begins to sew up you take your hammer and boof slam it into him again  reopening and you can see now parts of his muscles are exposed a deep purplish color this  very unnatural interior to his flesh you can see it burn as the flames cauterize the edges of the  wound awesome does 
none	 that finish your turn do you want to move at all  travis im staying is trinket still behind me  matt trinket is currently flanking the guy  travis yeah no ill stay  matt okay that brings us to the guards turn they all reload their crossbows these four are  now going to make shots at you percy these three are going to take shots all five of these guys  are going to take shots at grog now theyre trying to take you down so they can move onto the  next target so four shots 
none	 on you percy that is 20  taliesin that hits  matt 18  taliesin that hits  matt 20  taliesin that hits  matt and 11  taliesin that does not hit  matt okay so you take from three heavy crossbow bolts at you seven 19 32 points of piercing  damage all three bolts stick into your chest theyre big long thick heavy  crossbow bolts one of them gleans off your shoulder and catches the edge of the wall but the  other two have actually sunk into your torso and are sticking out of 
none	 you the other five against  you grog  travis yep  matt since you did not do reckless strike last time they are not with advantage that is 19  travis hits  matt 12  travis misses  matt oh thats a 25  travis hits  matt that is a 19  travis hits  matt last one is a 24  travis yep so four out of the five  matt yep thats 11 plus seven 18  travis 18  matt plus eight 25  travis 26  matt plus 13 so 39  travis 
none	 39 half  matt 18  travis okay  matt 18 points of piercing damage again bolts are sticking out of your body all over you almost  have additional armor from the number of bolts that are on your body but youre still standing  there frothing at the mouth angry just like come at me that ends the guards turn they all  reload their bolts and pull their crossbows up vex youre up  laura yay can i get up to the doorway tell me that i can  matt with a dash you can yeah  
none	 laura but i dont get any action then  matt unfortunately no  laura damn it  travis janet  laura damn it janet all right trinkets just going to try to claw him  matt okay go ahead two attacks from trinket  laura yep  liam make it good  sam come on youre my favorite bear trinkie  laura that hits him that definitely hits him  liam 16 plus a lot  laura yeah  matt oh yeah that hits him  laura and liam a natural 20  cheering  travis laughs trinket got a 
none	 natural 20  matt all right so damage on the first strike  sam that was a critical rawrl  laura 11 for the first and then  travis so sour it was sweet  liam three plus seven is ten 20 which part doubles  laura just the dice doubles  matt the dice doubles yeah  laura 13 for the second attack  matt so a total of 23 damage all right  laura 24 damage  matt 24 damage how does trinket want to do this  cheering  laura he really just killed a vampire  
none	 liam is this a first  taliesin this is a first  travis i think its trinkets first kill  marisha trinket  laura trinket claws crosswise and takes off his head with a bite  matt okay so as trinket reaches down whoosh arcing both claws across his back tylieri is  dropped to his hands and knees looks up as trinket then puts his jaws down over the head and  lifts up as you see the flesh begin to tear on his body he screams out in pain as the body  fluttering sound turns to mist 
none	  laura damn it hes a vampire  liam wait is the mist there  matt the mist is there yeah theres a clump of mist where he once was  liam somebody light a match  marisha im coming  laura so the head disappears from his mouth or did he still get a big taste  matt theres still some thick purplish congealed blood in his mouth but the vampires  form has been forced to mist at zero hit points all right that brings us to keyleth  marisha okay so seeing vax go over the table 
none	 and being like that was cool im also going to  be like grunts over the table im going to join the dukes of hazzard train  matt acrobatics check  marisha damn it thats not bad  matt its not a huge difficulty  marisha acrobatics 17  matt 17 yeah you jump up shh slide across land across the bonus there is that it takes only  one block of movement to get across thats five foot there  marisha so im going to come in and i see a headless dude with mist swirling around him  
none	 matt no you just see grog vax and trinket in the center of this foyer with a big cloud of mist  near trinket and grog and an entire array of guards with heavy crossbows trained down on the  three of them in this ambush pit  sam would she know what it was  laura yeah you would weve learned about vampires we know they turn into mist  liam yeah the vampires down by the tree did this they misted in  travis sunlight that shit  laura sunbeam  marisha someone could yell at me to 
none	 do it  taliesin shouts sunlight  matt i would say make an intelligence check  marisha okay this one  sam ooh thats the intelligent dice  taliesin yes it is  marisha yes it is just with my modifier  matt yeah  marisha wait is this a saving throw just my modifier so 17  matt 17 okay id say given the circumstance right now just rushing in and seeing mist there  and people with things you have no idea thats a vampire you have no reason to believe thats a  vampire you just know 
none	 that right now there is im just being honest here you walk in the room  and theres a little bit of mist on the ground and theres a bunch of guards up there it looks like  theres a threat of a bunch of guards in the room  travis identify it its a vampire  laura you know it now  matt laughs grog in the middle of a frenzied rage would not have that  taliesin i would have enough to point and say oh for the love of god okay fine  matt keyleth take your 
none	 turn  laura oh man  matt no more metagaming take your turn what do you want to do  travis what are you doing  marisha well i know what i want to do but i cant do it without feeling guilty i was going to  sunbeam this bitch  matt it only makes sense im just saying  marisha what makes sense that i wouldnt know  matt that you wouldnt know that that little bit of mist on the ground there is a vampire theres  no way that keyleth would know that based on the 
none	 way you  liam just missed it  matt yeah you just missed it  marisha i would just see a black mist  matt its just a mist  travis weve got a ton of other people in the room though  matt and theres black smoke around one of the guards up there  marisha well if i saw a black mist what i would probably do realistically is think it was some  sort of poison shit and i would wind wall it so im going to goosh wind wall that mist  matt okay all righty 
none	 lets see laughs this should actually be pretty interesting  marisha weakly its what i would assume it was but i might be aiding it in getting away  matt all right  marisha this is bullshit  matt all right so you put a wind wall up fwoosh in this area you can see the mist  dissipates for a second and holds its place however this wind wall is now currently held up  in this area thats your action  marisha i wind wall it to keep essentially do the wind wall  matt here  marisha 
none	 yeah around grog  matt right at this area  marisha yeah id want to protect him from the crossbows  matt okay so theres just wind rushing up around you can see the tapestries on the walls  are flickering around  marisha and then i once again go scanlan scanlan  matt theres a little bit of crackling through youre right at the cusp of the distance on these  communicators scanlan you hear bits and pieces at this point in time right now youre  sam im on the roof  matt youre hearing crackling in your 
none	 ear but youre still on the roof doing the chaos so you  havent heard anything really coming through at this point  laura doing the chaos  matt youre going to stay right there  sam im doing this thing  matt yeah youre trustfalling off the roof  marisha yeah im going to back into the corner and keep this wind wall up  matt okay just concentrating on the wind wall that brings us up to percy  taliesin i take my next shot at the next crossbow bugger  matt go for it  taliesin thats 
none	 15  matt 15 just misses  taliesin god damn it  matt it hits the armor and it ricochet noise ricochets off  marisha so am i encapsulating the mist in my wind wall im kind of trapping the mist in  matt the wind wall itself is not a full circle its just a semicircle  marisha a halfcircle yeah but is it stuck in the wall  matt its currently overlapped with it yeah  marisha okay  taliesin thats 22  matt 22 to hit  taliesin yeah  matt hits  taliesin it hit thats 
none	 18 points of damage  matt all righty and you have your third attack  taliesin my third attack also on him is also 22  matt that hits as well  taliesin and thats ooh that sucks two points of ice damage plus 11 points of normal damage  matt 13 total okay so doosh the last two blasts hit him and you can see he almost gets  thrown off his feet from the impact theres now blood trickling out from under his helmet from  where one of the blasts got his chin one into his chest 
none	 hes still standing up barely and hes  still confused by this smoke thats swirling around him are you going to stay where you are  taliesin im going to take a step forward  matt right there  taliesin up the stairs  matt up the stairs okay  taliesin yeah  matt just ominously stepping up the stairway i like it that brings us to vax  liam right so im going to start rushing up the stairs before i do im going to spank grog as  hard as i can on the ass and say kill 
none	 and run up the stairs at the first guy whos enveloped in  percys smoke and start stabbing him  matt okay hes up above the banister so you probably have to  liam theres no balcony  matt no the idea is the banister rides up and theres a wall along it and then theyre all up  on the second floor here looking down at this  liam so theres no way up there  matt you could leap up make an acrobatics check to leap up and over the banister  liam thats what ill do yeah 
none	 thats good thats 30  matt yeah you jump grab it flip over land on the balcony next to the guy enveloped in smoke  liam and i stab him  matt go for it  liam okay did the leaping take any of my actions its movement  matt no its part of your movement  liam okay so thats 22  matt 22 hits  liam and a 16 and a one  matt first two hit  liam yeah okay the first one is the flametongue dagger that is four plus six is ten and the  
none	 second one is the keen dagger and that is two plus seven is nine  matt all right as you rush up the guard looking at you confused the smoke swirling around him  stabbing sounds as the first two daggers stab in the second one actually finds between his ribs  up to where his heart is and you see him gasp for a second as he crumples beneath your grip and you  slide the blade out as he crumples to the ground  liam thats the button  matt laughs that is the dead button all right 
none	 that ends your turn tylieri  sam wait hes still alive  laura hes a mist  matt all right the mist pushes past hes going to use some action to move  laura he pushes past the wind wall but it says that figures caught in a gaseous form cant pass  through the wind wall in the spell  marisha that it does  laura i just read it  marisha thats my motherfucking wind wall  laura so its going to screw up my arrows so i was checking in but yeah it also says  creatures 
none	 in gaseous form cant pass through it  sam why would they even have a hypothetical for that  liam marisha and taliesin because of this  taliesin because of the things right here  marisha its coming in handy  liam thanks mike mearls  matt however as part of that then trinket is also in the wind wall as well just as a note so  trinket will be taking bludgeoning damage for being within it so just as a headsup in fact  right now have trinket make a strength saving throw  marisha sorry  laura 
none	 its okay  sam is it like a hurricane or something  marisha its a wall of wind  laura eight  matt okay trinket takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage  marisha how much  matt go ahead and roll 3d8  liam 3d8 up to 24  sam whoa  matt yeah i thought you were capturing him inside i didnt realize you had it actually on  him and so having the wind wall on him to prevent him from moving would also have trinket in it yeah  marisha it could be worse thats six plus four so 
none	 ten  liam hes had worse hell be fine  laura yeah okay  matt all right so that will make it actually more here so tylieri cannot break through  tylieri stays there in mist form being caught in the whirlwind grog youre up  travis im up  matt yep  travis well i cant get through the i mean i dont know what the fuck  marisha you can get through the wind wall  travis what am i going to do to gas hit it can i start running up the motherfucking stairs and  jump 
none	 up like vax did he said to kill  matt all right yeah you can get up to there and youre just within reach to get one guy over  the banister probably  travis yeah id like to do that thats a 23  matt that hits more attacks  travis yes oh how many attacks do i get  matt all of them that was just your movement  travis yay i get all of them thats amazing  matt your barbarian 40 feet of crazy movement  travis yay 22  matt yep  travis shit 12 
none	  matt 12 does not hit  travis laughing okay  matt laughs the first two hit  travis 13 17 for the first one  matt all right 17 damage  travis 15 and 17 again two plus two  matt nice all right so whack the hammer comes streaking down slamming into the guard there his  crossbow shatters from the impact and the flames begin to lick up the front of his body the second  slam smacks him again this time you hear the armor ring out from the metalonmetal impact he  kind of shakes 
none	 from it the third time youre just in the middle of this series of swinging and he  backs up and you end up smashing the banister instead of him the hammer cracking part of the  ground on the second floor he looks pretty messed up from that series of attacks all right that  ends your turn grog its now the guards turn  travis come at me bro  matt this guards going to move over here theyre all like oh god these three here are  going to attempt to fire on trinket through the wind 
none	 wall these two are going to fire at you  grog and these two are going to longsword you they pull out their longswords this ones going  to turn with his crossbow and fire at you vax so first is the attack at you with the crossbow that  is a 20  liam oh yeah that hits  matt you take ooh thats a ten 13 points of piercing damage as the bolt strikes you right in  the chest cracking your sternum a little bit youre like groans thats going to suck you  feel the scraping 
none	 of the bone as it impacts the two with the longswords against you grog  travis yep  matt that is 18  travis misses  matt that is a 12  travis misses  matt both of the blades come at you one of them actually hits your shoulder but it just sticks an  inch into the flesh and you just flex and the blade pops out the second one swings out and you  duck your head out of the way and it whoosh goes long and you just grin through the anger thats  awesome then 
none	 these two are going to fire crossbows at you grog that is going to be a 15  travis misses  matt and a 23  travis damn i was almost neo just dodging all sorts of shit  matt another ten 13 points of piercing damage  travis halved to seven  matt half that to seven yeah and then now the three aiming at trinket they all have  disadvantage i believe  laura nothing can shoot through the wind wall  matt nothing can shoot through it at all  laura arrows cant go through it it

none	 a certain height  marisha 15 foot high  matt 50 feet long 15 feet high so it doesnt go all the way to the ceiling in fact it gets just  a little bit past the second floor so its about the height of the guys on the second platform  that ends their turn vex youre up  laura okay im going to tell trinket to get out of the wind wall  matt okay  sam the wind wall gets an attack of opportunity  laughter  laura well hes going to move  matt he goes 
none	 to the front door  laura and hes going to be very happy to see me come around the corner of that door  matt all right  laura where i will see a bunch of dudes up high and i want to try to do conjure barrage up and  over the wind wall and in an arc downward on everybody on the other side of it  matt interesting okay  laura its like a whoo boom  travis a halfpull  matt yeah which at this short distance is not a lot of strength to get the 
none	 lob  laura im a really skilled archer im kind of like legolas  matt but if youre shooting up this way the wind wall itself only really encompasses the bottom of  the foyer so if you go up the stairs a little bit you will be able to get these guys here  laura can i get up there  matt yeah  laura oh yeah fuck yeah ill do it and try to get everybody in that cone sorry guys  travis nope make it rain  matt yeah youre going to hit all of them  
none	 travis just go for it im a fan of onedollar bills  liam i can take it  laura okay wait ive got to see how this works i just throw it in the air and it turns into a cone  matt yep  laura so i dont have to attack  matt they should have a saving throw i believe right  laura yeah they have a dexterity saving throw  matt everyone make a dexterity saving throw or at least you two  liam yeah  travis do i have advantage i dont know  laura im 
none	 casting this as a 3rdlevel  matt one guy makes the saving throw  liam 25  travis 20  matt you all succeed one of the villains makes it and they both make it is it halfdamage  right  laura what about all those guys up at the top  matt thats what im saying this guy made it these two didnt  laura what about the other ones  matt are you doing it from this perspective these will go through the wind wall so the wind  wall itself will prevent it from getting to either 
none	 this guy will probably be hit actually  laura okay  matt he fails so yeah these guys are unaffected because the wind wall prevents the barrage from  that point so just go ahead and roll damage  laura so i cant get a critical hit on this because i dont have to roll  matt correct  travis thats good  laura 16 am i right 16 okay  matt 16 damage  laura yeah  matt all right so its half that for saves right  laura yeah  matt all right so eight damage four damage

none	 you release your hand forward a blast of pure sun energy shoots forth from your hands you  see it burning the back wall like a big thick laser and as the mist tries to escape you catch  up to it and you hear this faint echoing screeching cry as the mist immediately is  evaporated on impact explosion noise  laura can we loot the mist  travis laughs can we loot the mist  matt you can fill a pocket with ash if you like  travis come on at least some coins falling  laura ding

none	 in the rain outside melt with  prejudice okay  travis got one guy left  matt now as you guys are all gathering around well say from a roleplaying standpoint as there  is no real immediate threat to you there is one guard left who has currently one broken ankle and  one missing lower half of his left leg on the ground looking at you all hyperventilating and  trying to back away like panting  travis time to call the sandman  marisha since im outside on the threshold of the house can i see where 
dung	 scanlan might have lit up  the other house yet  matt make a perception check  marisha 17  matt 17 you can see a little bit of a dark stream in the distance you cant tell if its a  nearby chimney or if it is the symbol of scanlan the rainstorm does make it a little hard to see  at this point and through the adrenaline pumping in your system and the fact that you just  disintegrated two individuals in a short period of time youre also wrestling with the morality of  that and 
none	 dealing with what you just did so your concentration doesnt enable you to notice  anything yet  marisha okay  travis whos got questions for pegleg over here  liam i do i hop down off the balcony and walk up by grog  taliesin im going to start exploring the upstairs  marisha i stay standing outside just staring out into the distance waiting for scanlans cue  matt okay  sam when you see my cue attack  laughter  marisha yeah i know which is what we were technically supposed to do  laura no we

none	 take that as a means that  you werent supposed to be here but then we all saw what happened what happened to sir kerrion  and his house and that meant that you were here and that you meant business so tylieri and  vedmeyer we waited for a signal and we heard that you were planning an attack so we set up  guards here and prepared and sure enough you showed up which let us know that our contacts are  good and we thought that would be enough we didnt realize youd be walking in with 
none	 whatever  the fuck this thing is i dont even know what you are and he looks genuinely frightened at the  fact that you with all of these bolts sticking out of your body are still grinning above him  nothing should have survived that ambush  liam lets back this up a little bit you hung people from the sun tree  matt yeah as a warning  liam where i saw that child i slit his throat  matt extended choking sounds with a wet gurgle the life expires from his body a pool beginning  to
