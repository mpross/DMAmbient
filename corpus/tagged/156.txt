moving on no were going to go over a few things really fast while we wait for sam to get  here im just kidding im just kidding thank you guys for waiting so long out there in line  and for coming to see /dung/ us some of you as far away as finland where are my finland dudes at  audience member here  brian yes woo the tall guys in the front this panel will air 700 tuesday night in our  normal timed slot on geek  sundrys twitch and alpha 700 pm pacific if you guys want to watch  this if youre watching it right now its tuesday hello i have the night off im at home  drinking in the dark did you guys get pins when you came in everybody get pins we made those  specially for /none/ you guys so hope you like them if we see you out and about today theres also  people giving out some pin that says something about free denise or whatever so those are  some special edition ones my grandfather used to tell me brian a lot of things in this world are  free and denise is not one of them were going to try our best today to keep things as general as  possible but as always there may be some spoilers if you are not all the way caught up on  critical role sorry /none/ blamebrian and finally we like on talks machina for most of the questions to  come from you guys so halfway through the panel im going to let you know to line up at the mics  and well spend the second half of the panel you guys asking questions do me a huge favor do  everyone else a huge favor please just one question dont think were going to have time for  individual questions for each of the cast theres still a lot of them for now try to limit it to  one or two questions /none/ one question for one or two cast members if you will and now without  further ado i would like to introduce the cast of critical role  dramatic music  brian please welcome travis willingham  marisha ray  taliesin jaffe  sam riegel  liam obrien  woo laura motherfucking bailey  and our fearless leader give it up mr  matthew mercer give it up my goodness  matt thats a lot of people hi  sam brian hows it feel this is the most people that have or ever will see your show  brian i /none/ would have thought itd be a quarter of this at least after the first week speaking of  all these beautiful people out here lets start by talking about the community im not going to  ask many individual questions so you guys fight over who wants to answer what sam make sure  everyone gets a turn please  sam i can sing  brian lets hear it give us some britney yeah give us a little britney  sam britney singing you mightve been hurt babe normal i dont know is that britney  brian thats perfect no /dung/ thats good i think thats a great place to stop so between the  different portals where critical role is available every week a pretty insane amount of  people watch the show unlike mine im joking i said that because sam said that youre watching  mom and thats all that matters whats been the coolest or most surprising part about the  community surrounding this show for you guys  matt ill jump in here and say that an internet space that can be a very volatile and opinionated  place for people who are passionate im perpetually /none/ and continually proud that this  community has been so open so accepting and so supportive of each other that its kind of allowed  critical role to become so much more than just a show the community itself has become really the  driving and most important and magical thing about it to me so thats you guys were talking about you  laura oh there i am ive been most surprised by all of the sexytime art  brian all of the sexytime art  laura thats really not surprising  sam if i may ive been recently /none/ most impressed and surprised by the babies that have been named  after liam several new babies are out there in the world named liam im just throwing it out  there sams a nice name for a boy or a girl  matt so is travis boy or girl  liam i like seeing the hundreds of pictures weve seen of new games that you guys are playing a lot  of people who watch the show have never played dd didnt know what it was when they started  weve seen hundreds of photos of people around card /none/  tables and dining room tables its amazing to see this  game that we quietly loved on our own at home spreading the way it is i mean its been around  for ages but i feel like its really kind of setting on fire  brian heck yeah so yeah hmm  sam the golf clap  brian a lot of people were like i agree with what he said but id like to be gentle about it  so as were approaching nearly a hundred episodes of critical role and lets see almost probably  five years /none/ of playing some of these characters  matt yeah  brian what are the joys and challenges of a game versus a show and how do you not lose one or the  other  matt oh man thats a good question  brian hes confused by the question immediately  matt as far as like challenges of both ways when you have a show especially when its  something that you do privately thats put on display theres a difficulty of one waiting for  an audience to set it on fire and watch the thing you love be /none/ burned to the ground thankfully that  didnt happen  brian thats my job matt  matt not yet but i think at least between the two what makes shows like this and other tabletop  shows and kind of what internet media is pushing for now is people that are open about their  passion and are creating it for themselves as well as the audience and not just as content to be  consumed its an invitation to be part of it as opposed to hope you like this thing i made as  long as we maintain /none/ that i think were doing okay  travis i think we had two solid years of playing so we knew what our game was we knew who our  characters were we knew how much we hate each others guts and how irreverent we are we dont  give a shit what anybody thinks  marisha definitely not friends  travis right thats true  marisha not based on friends  travis once we got used to the randomass cameras being in the room we keep doing our thing live  shows are totally thats another thing  taliesin thats /none/ a whole different thing  travis theres a lot of people out there  marisha i know yeah i will say doing the live show when i got the how do you want to do this  and the entire audience exploding at gen con definitely one of the top three maybe four  moments of my life its insane  matt that is one of the weirdest things having this little phrase that organically started in our  game rooms at home not just on merch but other people in thousands of games use it now im like  /none/ its exciting i would never have thought that  marisha people have it tattooed on their bodies  matt i know im sorry this was not expected  laura i have it tattooed across my lower back  matt you too  travis you do  liam sam in a random game at laura and travis dining room table putting his finger here is now  the stuff of legend  sam yeah but we always did blame keyleth even at the home game  matt thanks keyleth  sam we kept that consistent  brian before this goes completely /none/ off the rails in about four minutes hey my dads here guys a  lot of people recently have been talking about the connection between tabletop rpgs and social  therapy has the show been therapeutic for you guys in any way and if so you know in what ways  travis i mean we drink a lot  liam youre going to put it right out there huh  travis water we drink water a lot  brian theyre too far away to see all the liver stains on your face from all of the goldschl√§ger  taliesin ill /none/ say the game is therapeutic i dont necessarily know if broadcasting it on the  internet is therapeutic but the game is i work things out  marisha yeah we work things out from the response on the internet from the week before on  the game its like an ouroboros  taliesin it was a few weeks ago i was with you and i was like man im in a mood percys going  to do something messed up man argh i need to put it somewhere im going to kill a guy somebody  yelled at my mom /none/ three states away grr true story  marisha that is true yeah  laura i think more than anything its the getting to hang out with our family every single  week you know because getting to hang out with you guys always puts me in such a good mood any  time im depressed or anything like that the minute we all get together its so uplifting  yeah wahwah cheesy whatever but its true  taliesin its true though because weve all done theater theres that family thing that happens in  theater but then theres that preshow /none/ jitter that happens with theater i dont get the  preshow jitter i just get the family vibe its really nice  laura i fully get a preshow jitter every time im on my way to the show im like i feel like  im about to do a play that i know none of the lines to  brian thats why you do a bunch of shots first  matt dont even talk about preshow jitters to me guys im a madman for an hour before every  cast you guys see me i dont even talk to them /none/ they come by like hey matt im like go away  im setting things up  laura and then when sam wasnt there just recently we reminded you right before the show  we were like oh yeah sams not here this week you were like oh thats right and you had to  completely play tary out of the blue  matt i was like okay cool thats happening give me more of that water travis  travis yeah we have rituals for that all the profanities that we throw to you right before we  go live its /none/ our way of going welcome matt  matt yeah thats a great little dodge and weave every week now  liam born out of love  marisha some people walk out to the ring with hardcore metal music we shout profanities at our  dm thats what we do to hype ourselves up  matt i dont recommend it unless be really good friends with your dm before you do that please  thats when the boulder appears and crushes your character so be careful  marisha on this entire question about therapy weve only talked about things that people /none/ go to  therapy about  matt but thats also part of therapy but no to try and tie it back to the question  brian please  travis no leave the question alone its done  matt well no i mean tabletop gaming theres been a lot of studies that speak on the  therapeutic benefits of the ability to create a persona that is outside of yourself live in those  shoes and build empathy through that experience i know i owe a lot of who i am today to playing  tabletop gaming not only this experience /none/ forged our friendships to be as strong as they are but  its now gone out and forged all these friendships through this community and beyond you  know there are people i used to game with that i still keep in contact to this day from a long time  ago so its a weird shared bond like going through a very intense experience together with  people except its all up here because were crazy in my eyebrows everyone has to go into my  eyebrows for the adventure  brian he stores all the next campaign in /none/ those eyebrows  matt thats what wildemount is translated to in dwarvish  liam ill also say i have one last thing to add before this show was a show when it was just a  game oh boy  matt let it happen  liam i in a very real way hit rock bottom when this was just our game at home then i did it  again during this show the people youre seeing up here are the closest outside of my own family  are my family were not faking it we werent cast these are the /none/ closest people in my life  they helped me work through some shit on stage its one of the greatest gifts in my life  brian hell yeah  cheering  laura that got more than golf claps liam congratulations  sam hes sensitive  brian even at wondercon something for tumblr okay that is all for tumblr hey where do you  guys feel vox machina stands in their everevolving ability to plan and seek varying  options how do you think its going  liam we are role models  laura were the worst just the worst at /none/ planning  travis man were seal team six shut up  laura honestly thats one of the hardest things about knowing that its being broadcast because  if we were at home and we were going through this planning stage itd be okay well were taking  our time planning no big deal lets go get some snacks while were doing it  liam who wants another mimosa  laura exactly wed be drinking mimosas whatever but on the show i know that people are  probably like oh my god just do something already  matt by people you /none/ mean travis  laura yeah pretty much yeah i do have that smoke rising next to me i can feel it  matt i will say you guys have gotten better recently i mean moderately incrementally there  has been more planning there has been more seeing alternate options before making a choice this  happened in a recent episode so you guys are stepping baby steps in a good direction travis  is already out all right next question  taliesin no but theres a fair point also to say and i feel like this is true even of /none/ my home  games that we played before stream i think of and i know im going to get a list of movie  titles you think of your favorite movies and so many of them are about making a plan and executing  it perfectly and then everything going fine and like thats not fun chaos is fun complete lack  of control is fun  travis you sounded like the joker just then that was amazing  liam we all cant wait till travis has to play a 19intelligence general or wizard next campaign  marisha yeah if /none/ youre not some type of war general planning sun tzu type of shit next  campaign  laura itll be great then well all know what to do  travis i plan to play a pigeon next im going down im not going up intelligence of six im  coming to three  laura he does nothing but drool the whole game  brian to go with matts point about being moderately better at it the reason the panel  started late is we were in the back and then the security guy said the panels right through that  /none/ door and everybody stopped and went  travis our old nemesis  brian weve seen one of these before matt tell us a little bit mild teeny baby mildsauce  spoilers tell us a little bit about devil contracts and the dangers of the hells where vox  machina currently find themselves  matt well for those who arent familiar with the difference between devils and demons in a  nutshell demons are an ancient chaotic force of destruction and mayhem devils are very organized  tyrannical structure of chaos and mayhem recent adventures bring them to a very dangerous /none/ place  with a lot of largescale dangers than theyre used to theyre used to singletarget localized  enemies theyve stepped into a territory where everything around you for forever is bad its  been fun to watch them squirm im not going to lie as far as contracts go thats the bread and  butter of the devils work thats how they gain their influence and power i was very eager to see  what the reaction was when such a contract was presented so without spoiling anything i am  very proud of my group from a dm /none/ standpoint not for you guys i absolutely love anything you do  that is a poor choice it fills me with such joy and inspiration but to be fair in the nine  hells there is no real great choice everything is going to probably end up poorly so good  luck  brian somebodys asking for some lord have mercer in the near future  laura i have a question though if you were good in the nine hells if you did something nice  thats actually the equivalent of doing something bad  matt i mean its not /none/ that black and white if you did something good people would be like  whyd you do that depending on who it was well find out huh  travis we dont plan on doing anything good  matt i didnt think so  brian or anything well  marisha is it kind of like a vegas situation like what happens in the nine hells stays in the  nine hells if so spring break 94 cancun  travis are there brothels in hell  laura are there brothels in hell are there brothels in hell  matt you know what /none/ incubi and succubi are guys grogll maybe find out tune in next week  brian dont taunt the dm  laura you have to sign a contract in order to walk into the brothel  matt what could possibly go wrong  brian guys in an orderly fashion please line up for questions if you have them we will get to  them shortly  matt where do they line up  brian theres a mic in the center here i see i am blinded singing blinded by the light  normal oh theres a spotlight right there in the /none/ center okay up next sam how much fun are  you having with everything going on right now because it looks like the answer is a lot  sam with my current state of characterization i dont want to spoil am i not supposed to spoil  things  brian i dont know what do you guys think is everyone caught up  audience members yes  brian hit them with it sam  sam yeah man so i get to play unlike everyone else on stage a new character right now its so  exciting and its so fun /none/ it was terrifying for the first two or three times as it will be for  you all when you all die but because like these guys said weve been doing these characters for  so long we know them backwards and forwards but to play a new guy is super weird it feels like  well i was going to say something really dirty and im not going to theres a little placard  right here that says please be aware that members of your audience are underage  brian i said the fword in the intro  sam /tavern/ anyway i feel hamhanded and weird and awesome what am i doing i dont know i dont  know what im doing oh god oh god its happening no stop it no its very  exhilarating brian and im having a lot of fun with it i dont know how long itll last but im  riding it  taliesin youve definitely inspired a lot of vaguely drunk conversations about what were going  to do next between a bunch of us weve started talking  liam lot of ideas when you made your entrance and saw all of our /tavern/ faces did you feel like you  had walked into a seedy tavern on the wrong side of town like some guy breaking a bottle and  sizing you up  sam you guys all had such scorn such hatred on your faces i was genuinely scared you would fire  me or something i dont know no it was great it made me work harder to try to convince you to  let me stick around and you did for now  laura and then everything you did i was like i dont believe it  marisha laura and /none/ i were genuinely pissed at you for a good 24 hours not cool  sam sorry i trolled you guys  marisha you totally did  brian doesnt that character seem like the kind of guy who would have a chumbawamba tattoo  sam for sure for sure he was into them long before tubthumping though  brian yeah thats true  taliesin britney you dont know but that you know okay glad thats making a map right there  brian so this questions from me  sam its for you  brian no from me man watch my lips /none/ when i speak read my lips noelle stevenson was on the  show this week special guest star and will be back this week now in almost 100 episodes of  critical role there have been many many guest stars would you guys say this is the first  noelle  groaning  travis oh my god boo this man  brian im not apologizing im not taking it back throw your fruit america lauras face is  the reason that joke made the cut i want to hear everyones favorite oneliners from the past 92  episodes  laura /none/ our favorite what  brian like pick out your favorite oneliner rapidfire them at me  taliesin people legitimately tweet quotes at me and my only reaction is i said that when did i  say that  marisha sometimes matt will read one back and ill be like thats funny who said that and  hell be like you did and im like oh  taliesin i dont even know the context anymore  marisha yeah what was i talking about  travis your secret is safe with my indifference is one  taliesin thank you im very proud /none/ of that one  marisha trust me i have an intelligence of six i know what im doing  taliesin im going to be a jerk i can only think of one of my own life needs things to live im  so glad that has weirdly i was so tired im so pleased thank you sam that has become a thing i  can never escape it ever again  sam its profound  taliesin oh i was so tired  laura oh man i liked oh i cant say it because under 18 in the darkness i say /none/  fuck i liked that one  matt i mean technically it was written but it had a lot of impact i think by a good writer  when patrick rothfuss wrote the letter to keyleth the you passed through fire i think was such a  wonderful encapsulation of her character arc at that time  liam that guy can write  matt yeah he should do a book at least a third one sorry pat  brian there was one episode maybe 20 episodes ago where matt was describing something and hes  like theres this giant cylinder /none/ its almost wheelshaped and sam goes wheel thats like  yes a wheelshaped wheel why wouldnt i have just said a wheel okay last question from me  and then well go to the audience whats something about your characters you think will  never change despite what vox machina ends up going through oh god this guy  travis ale  brian yeah good answer  marisha i mean shes always going to put her foot in her mouth at least once a week  travis get arrested once a year  marisha yeah hopefully i dont think i /none/ ever want keyleth to lose her wonderlust her  excitement for the world and her love for the world  taliesin i think the air of superiority may go it may not but the anger issues i dont think  are ever going away hell never stop pretending he doesnt have them  liam is that in character  taliesin percy voice no yes of course  sam poop andor puke  liam vax will probably always step in front of trains if he thinks it will keep the family safe  laura aww urgh vex will probably always hold /none/ grudges shell always want to get naked in random  situations and shell always love trinket  sam and victor will have less and less digits  matt i will always have multiple personality disorder there we go thank you  brian who is up first at the mic with the spotlight on it  laura in the pikelight  brian hello  sam hey loot crate shirt  audience member so my question is for marisha taliesin and sam simple what would you  multiclass your character into if you had whatever option  taliesin oh current character  /none/ audience member yes current character  brian no the one im writing for you for the next campaign im writing all your new  characters  marisha barbarian  taliesin whoa  marisha yeah but im going for that archdruid bitches i want that level 20  taliesin god probably sorcerer at this point which i know would be a little weird but id make  it work im not going to multiclass but if he did thats where it would end up  sam i mean i just asked matt what multiclassing is so i dont really know how /none/ to play dungeons  and dragons i dont know wizard is that a thing is wizard a thing okay great  matt wizard is actually artificeradjacent so yeah  sam okay good  liam yeah you never play youve only played 500 hours  sam as one guy well two  matt youre a busy man making duck tales and shit its fine  brian thank you hey whats your name  jared hi im jared hi this question is actually for matt you are awesome and i aspire  to be a dm like you someday  matt you /dung/ are awesome and i aspire to be you  jared thank you so i have watched your whole series on tips for dungeons masters i was  wondering if there was anything else that you had to tell any dungeon masters who are up and coming  also if maybe youre going to be on the floor to sign my dungeon masters guide and bless it so  that my campaign goes well  brian does that work matt do you hear from people that if youve blessed a players  handbook that they rule  matt yeah dice and /none/ books before and you know what i feel guilty if they dont work and if  they work im happy to take credit but thank you as far as advice goes my first point of  advice would be watch matt colvilles youtube channel theres a lot i would like to say but i  dont have the time to get into the nittygritty and he has such an incredible way of communicating  very elaborate detailed and informative conversations and discussions on this topic if  you havent seen his work check out his videos theyre incredible hes a /none/ dear friend and an  amazing writer so check it out as far as blessing your book i can bless it from here and  if you can hunt me down at some point today we couldnt get a spot to do a signing at this  convention unfortunately wondercon was a little slammed but i will send my juju from here  sam ill grab a piece of his hair for you later  brian yeah we can get that cleared with the con staff whos up next step into the light whats  up  marcus hello  /none/ taliesin white phoenix shirt very solid feeling it  marcus im marcus and my question is to matt ive noticed a lot of 18s and 19s failing recently  while in where they are im trying to keep spoilers out is that due to levels scaling or is  it due to where they are  matt its due to the scaling of the entities that theyre working with and the situation involved  a dc can be set based on how difficult the challenge is you know if a persons like im  trying to stealth in a shadowy /none/ alleyway thats going to be a pretty low dc but if im going to  try and stealth while standing on top of this lighthouse in broad daylight itll probably have  a higher dc to roll a proper stealth check  liam i can do it  matt he could probably pull it off so yeah i adjust the dc if a persons trying to convince  somebody and they make a really convincing argument ill lower the dc for a persuasion roll  if they really bungle it up then ill raise it a little higher so yeah /none/ itll adjust depending a  lot of creatures that work in the place where they currently are you know the hells they thrive on  deception and being paranoid especially in dis dispater the archdevil of where they are right  now is a very paranoid son of a bitch that nature of always looking to see if your underlings  are trying to undermine you means that if youre trying to lie theyre going to definitely have a  high sense for that and be looking for that as well so yeah to answer your question yes thank  /none/ you  brian whos up next i dont know why i said that so creepy  eddie youve seen me before i was at gen con i have a question for you guys oh eddie freeman  by the way freeman free man eddie freeman my question for you is you guys just entered hell  as your characters what were your first impressions and your second impressions of hell  travis everythings hot and it burns  marisha kind of reminds us of the city of brass  taliesin this is fine  travis the food is not that /none/ bad  matt im going to call this to the art community can somebody please do an art piece of vox machina  sitting in the city of dis saying communally this is fine please sam  sam my guys been so petrified terrified for the last all of their travels together that this  is nothing new i mean hes at a baseline of abject terror all the time  liam temporarily thinking one last job just one last job until it all fucks up again oops  sorry  sam children its a dungeons and dragons term  /none/ laura i think vex quickly realized that her normal tricks arent working down there and now  shes at a loss i dont know what the eff im supposed to say i dont know because none of her  persuasion was working it sucks  matt roll higher  laura oh its the dice its totally just the dice its not my bumbling over words  matt no not at all  brian okay its not the dice because if two thousand people believe one thing and one guy  believes another and he goes all of you were wrong /none/ i think it might be its probably the  dice whos up next thank you eddie freeman good to see you man i love that thing  laura we still have it yeah we have at our house you gave one to travis before right  brian oh thats cool whos up next  brendan hey guys my name is brendan im flexing because travis youre yoked as hell  laura oh youre wearing your strongjaw shirt  brendan so thanks for the flex travis this is for you youre not ashamed of being a fan of  hamilton recently /none/ lin manuel tweeted that he played his first game of dd sorry who would you  rather have a song of inspiration from scanlan or lin manuel  travis ooh i would require a rap battle between one scanlan shorthalt and one lin manuel miranda  to drop some lyrical rhymes the winner could be my inspiration maker  matt i will say now that lin manuel has gotten himself a little warmed up i think its time for  him to take another crack at a different dd game  laura that would be amazing  matt no seriously /none/ lin please come play with us  brian get on it denise whos up next hey  audience member hello so laura you specifically this last episode came in with a  slightly different accent so not to call you on it but how do you guys in total keep your voices  in check how do you keep your voices in your head in check  laura normally its not that hard i came off of an eighthour session of recording as a south  african so it was in my brain is all  sam i dont know /none/ how matt does it i mean he changes accents within sentences sometimes  matt i had a lot of time alone as a kid i make notes i have general notes next to certain npcs  of their vocal texture their age different things to get me cliffs notes i try and ballpark  it whenever they show up or i make something up  sam so is it like age and a descriptor or is it like this one sounds like lucky the leprechaun  matt i mean if there is a celebrity i can attribute it to ill /none/ put that down like an alan  rickman type or an orson welles type usually its like you know gravelly low basically what  youd see in any voiceover side where its super vague but just enough to get an idea  liam oh it must be a weird setlist like godfried chocolate rain  matt kind of yeah like most of my notes its all sanskrit at this point its only for me to  read  brian who is up next  jared 2 hi  brian whats your name  jared 2 my name is jared as /none/ well hi this is a question for matt whats been one of your  favorite experiences as a dm in the past couple of years doing critical role  matt oh man i mean some of my favorite experiences as a dm involve having an opportunity  to share what little knowledge i have with people and learn things from other dms you know as a  community dd for a long time was whatever you could learn from your local comic shop and maybe  a forum board in the mid2000s when that became more of a thing so /none/ now theres this breadth of  information out there from all these different schools of running a game for me its been  really cool to learn from other people and try and impart what i do know thats hopefully helpful to  other people thats been a big thing as far as actually playing a game with these guys id say  probably the attack on emon having a twoandahalfyearlong plot hook thats been  brewing and brewing and get them into this place of comfort and finality and then smash it all to  pieces and watch their /none/ faces as everything they know crumples around them that was pretty fun  brian whos next step on up to the mic  marisha each person that walks up its like a reveal step into the spotlight  brian hi hey whats your name  anthony anthony lopez so my question is not really specific to anyone but who would your  greatest dream celebrity guest be  marisha stephen colbert  laura oh my god yes  brian scanlan shorthalt  sam hes a fun guy  matt what about you guys anyone else  taliesin i feel like /none/ weve talked about this before and now im drawing a blank other than  lin manuel  sam it would be nice to have like the entire cast of cats i dont know like in costume i  dont know might be fun  matt as one cumulative guest they switch out roleplaying the character  brian and then sam could come in dressed as hotis from the halloween episode and totally steal the  show obviously  marisha we have tossed into the universe that we would love to try and play with the stranger  things kids  /none/ matt and since we already got vin diesel the next step obviously is madame judi dench i think  shed have fun since he did teach her how to play yeah  brian yeah ive often heard if you can get diesel you can get dame judi whos up next  thank you  travis they package them together a lot  sam one of our guests is here by the way jason miller  brian jason charles miller raise your hand also did the theme song for critical role and talks  machina ladies and gentlemen royalty  laura /none/ you know hes the one that wrote our opening theme song right  sam also dame judi dench is right over there  matt hello  audience member hi i mainly had a question about when you converted from your preshow game to your  live did anything change because you converted from pathfinder to 5th edition character or  storywise  matt storywise no i mean some of the character abilities changed based on the system  but not a whole lot thankfully  sam some of the mechanics of how it works change we had to relearn we /none/ did a couple of practice  sessions with matt  matt ill tell you scanlan became a lot more helpful  sam yeah for sure  taliesin we had like three iterations of me before i was really functional i think  matt yeah and then i had to completely create the 5thedition transition for your gunslinger  but other than that  laura i almost switched when we switched over to 5th edition there was that alternate path for  ranger that i feel is actually way cooler than the beastmaster yeah thats why you homebrewed so  much /none/ of it and it was awesome but it was like trinket what am i going to do i have to have  trinket hes trinket so i stuck with it  sam you could leave the bear leave the bear behind  laura leave doty how about you just leave doty  sam doty works  laura doty stands around and hes heavy and hes slow  sam and he writes my every word wouldnt you want that in real life wouldnt you want a guy  right behind you all the time  taliesin i will admit i really /none/ like matts dotyface  laura yeah it is really great  taliesin its like a cartoon bird  matt thank you very much  brian whos next  travis step into the light  laura gasps fun buns  brian hey whats your name  diane im diane  laura oh wait those are ears they look like fun buns from up here  diane no theyre ears my question is to the panel has matt always been this sadistic or is  he really working at it  matt and laura always  brian that is a great question /none/  sam hes been really bad lately but at the beginning of the game he was very supportive and  he wanted us to enjoy hes like a dealer right he hooks you with some easy kills and then slips  you the hard stuff then hes got you  matt there has to be you know ebb and flow there has to be some encounters that are  relatively not as challenging so you can really enjoy the power that youve acquired as a  character then there have to be challenges along the way to make you feel /none/ like its a terrible  difficult circumstance yeah  liam matt is generally one of the kindest people ive ever met but those quiet waters run deep  man you dont know whats under the surface hums jaws theme  marisha having the entire party strung up on a tree in whitestone thats when i was like who  are you who am i sleeping next to every night oh god  matt hi i have a love for gothic horror im sorry  marisha what do you dream  matt i dream of trees  brian we should move /none/ on before this engagement falls apart thank you very much before our very  eyes how was wondercon well we saw the breakup of an engagement whos next  liam i had it too though when gilmore shanked vax in my mind i was like how dare you how  dare you  matt there was a reason  marisha and this past game you punished travis for using big words  matt because it was funny and travis agrees  travis yeah i caught that i did it right at the same time i was like agh it hurts /none/  brian hey whats your name  kyrie im kyrie hi my question was for matt whats your favorite mini that youve used in the  game so far marisha does he sit on the floor at home going grr argh with them  marisha sometimes not lying every time he gets a new dwarven forge set he plays house  brian periscope periscope  matt its practicing and rehearsing and learning techniques for the show guys thats totally it  no to be fair for a good ten years since they first announced it and i couldnt afford it /none/ ive  always looked at a distance from the colossal red dragon mini the colossal mini just could never  get it when you guys as a community sent two of them it was like a longtime christmas coming  that finally arrived those are centerpieces that im still proud of to this day then somebody sent  me a painted tarrasque thats just waiting for the day that it gets to be unleashed thats pretty  fun too thats going to be good  travis no no  brian hard pass from travis on that  matt so yeah /none/ definitely probably those two thank you  brian who is up next yeah hey whats your name  sean sean hi i wanted to start with a little matt and liam you inspired me to be a dm laura  marisha and ashley you are three of my greatest female role models even though ashleys not here  sam and taliesin you significantly improved my wit and travis ive started working out i  swear my question is when tarys book is finally released like volo and elminster did will vox  machina release an annotated copy  sam did /none/ he say when tary dies oh will i write one in real life is that the question  laura no the question is will vox machina release a second one with the truth  sam sorry i was really not listening at all i actually sat down the other night to maybe write a  little bit of a book  matt do it thatd be awesome  sam yeah i really did i dont know whats going to happen  matt thatd be a lot of fun would you guys like to see that  cheering  sam i /none/ dont know i will see how far i get well

costume  brian whats your name  joel im joel favorite magical item  matt favorite magical item  travis deck of many things  laura broom of flying  marisha im a little partial to the dust of tracelessness just because then i get to hear /none/  travis say i do the dust of tracelessness with my flower girl routine  taliesin i like the milkwatermayonnaise jar  matt the alchemical jug  liam grog with the bag of holding has brought us so much joy  marisha basically all the things grog has all of grogs stuff  laura the amount of dried poo thats probably floating around in the bag of holding  liam the worst dimension ever  matt the grog dimension  travis what you fools havent realized is that i have amassed all the magical power in the  universe im /none/ going to kill all of you  brian hes turned into thanos  travis im going to hotglue it all to an oven mitt and be like i am now the strongest in the  world  laura the greatest part is how detailed traviss list is for the bag of holding i mean it is  like from the beginning of our game every single thing written down in there  taliesin that asmodeus ring that was a deep cut man  travis we got dried poo in that bag  laura thats what im saying i know there /none/ is dried poo in there  travis yeah theres like three pieces in there you know some people collect sand from different  beaches i got to take poop  brian some people collect poop from different bitches whos up next  matt my answer real fast to that because i feel it needs a mention is craven edge just  because the grog interactions were so much fun  brian yes look at this whats your name  laura oh my god you look beautiful  christina hi guys my names christina so i have a question for taliesin /none/ and matt actually  with percivals love of these demon deals and matts newfound love of demon litigation with that  contract in the hells can we expect a sort of version of soul claims court at this point over  percys soul  sam the peoples court  taliesin some sort of soul litigation  matt i guess well have to find out i mean it depends on whether or not the first person the  deal was made with still exists and if it does and there is actually a place in the hells for  people that /none/ are contesting contracts there is a pit fiend baatezu who is there as the judge that  is part of the process of you trying to appeal your contract when your soul arrives usually goes  poorly anyway but there are a few that get off its kind of fun  liam sounds like hell within a hell  taliesin do a little faust play mephistopheles  matt i guess well see if you take the other pacts or break this one  taliesin im a little worried i dont know hell makes me very nervous right now ive got /none/ to  admit im a little nervous  travis nah youre fine  marisha remember this is fine  brian great question even better costume and it lights up the bow lights up hell yeah somebody  get you a prize weve got time for two more lets move quick so we can get
