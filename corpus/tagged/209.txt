/none/ dramatic music  brian to the lord of the underworld taliesin jaffe  cheering  brian yeah yeah up next steer clear of lava sharp dropoffs shes the most fun in the world  marisha ray  cheering  brian and finally the man whose brain spawned all of this weirdness matthew mercer  cheering  brian yeah  matt oh hai adjusting our chairs the whole  brian yeah were going to be doing a lot of  marisha these are awkward chairs  brian get their moneys worth well we decided that were just going to do a /none/ qa for the hour so  line up in an orderly fashion and  matt orderly calmly respectfully  marisha lifeguard rules no running concrete is slippery  brian a couple of guidelines really fast if we can want to try to just do one question so we can  get through as many as possible then were not able to do selfies or anything like that because  of the rules  laughter  brian and the distance the sheer distance but yeah were going to try to get through as many as  we can so lets do /none/ it please tell us your name before your question too so we can know who you  are and put a name with that beautiful beautiful face  alex hello is this on  matt oh can we get some audio on that mic if you dont mind  brian then well probably need that up here in this speaker  taliesin just keep saying random things until it makes noise  alex ooh there we go hello  marisha little bit little bit more little bit louder  brian can we get that in the weg so we can /none/ hear the question  matt could you count down for us ten to one  alex me okay  matt okay count down in the microphone for us  alex ten nine eight seven  matt we got it all right thank you  alex awesome there we go hello im alex  marisha willing to walk the line for us i love it  alex thank you so my question is for the three players and matt so when youre planning more  story arcs and sort of character directions for all the different characters like the de rolo /none/ arc  that percy had to go to do you discuss that with them beforehand to make sure its okay with them  as their player or do you surprise them with it  matt i mean when the characters create their backstories and such i let themâ€“ theyll ask me  some semblance of the world and you know locations and stuff and ill give them some  places they can pull from and they create from there background elements thats mainly their  creation and then i incorporate and tweak things as it goes but as far as /none/ things that are coming  up in the story no i want to surprise them as the character would know i mean if its  something that i feel needs to be a discussion i dont want to if i feel that itll deter or  alter heavily a direction they want to go with the character then maybe ill be like hey how do  you feel about me tweaking with something that you had already established but generally i want  the character to experience it with the player and viceversa so that really came to fruition with /none/  the briarwood arc  taliesin yeah i gave you about a page everything on whitestone and everything with percy  fits on about a page of relatively small type it was nothing that he wouldnt have already known  there was no information on that page that percy didnt know like nothing he didnt witness  himself he didnt know who the briarwoods were he didnt know what was happening he didnt know  even i left it pretty open whether or not the dream was a real dream or a demon or a whatever  there was none /dung/ of that information at one point im like i have a couple notes of things i want  to add and your response was well i would get your shit together pretty quick that was all i  was really given im like uh okay why oh no  matt yeah the whole orthax the whole smoke demon that was not converted it was just a dream  of some dark entity that inspired him and everything else extrapolated from there  taliesin it could have been just a dream it wouldve been that wouldve been interesting if  it /none/ had just been a dream and not really a thing and it was just him being a terrible person  thats great  alex all right thank you so much oh  brian thanks alex  matt good question which by the way just out of curiosity raise your hand if youve not seen  any critical role or have any idea what it is i am so excited for you youre going to be so  confused this entire panel its going to be great  brian this is not about scientology just to let you guys know  /none/ matt but so youre aware critical role is a twitch stream where a bunch of nerdyass voice  actors present company included play dungeons and dragons once a week so this is our dd game  where we roll dice and get really geeky  cheering  matt sponsored by the red bull in my stomach hello whats your name  quinn hi im quinn and bidet  all bidet  quinn my question is has there ever been a moment where the players went completely off the rails  taliesin yelling lets go on a pub crawl woo  /none/ marisha i was about to say every thursday  matt part of your role as a dm or gm is youre trying to ascertain the probable direction theyll  take and prepare for that and then try and prepare for a couple of alternate scenarios  sometimes theyll shoot close to one of those and you can tailor some ideas to make it work  sometimes they end up going directly where you thought they were going and youre like yes then  sometimes theyll go a complete 180 and youre having to fly by the seat of your pants /none/ there are  a number of times that happened lets see  taliesin fire plane was a big one i remember you were almost irritated at the fire plane you  were borderline irritated  matt well i wasnt irritated i was like all right this is where were im never irritated  by it  taliesin we spent weeks telling you we werent going  matt yeah you were like well were not going there were not going there were going there  im like oh okay guess were going there the whole intro sequence of them arriving at /none/ the city  of brass the meeting of senokir as an npc that was all improvised that whole sequence i had  nothing prepared because i didnt think they were going to go there i had a semblance of some  things they might encounter in that area but i hadnt fleshed it out fully yet so yeah it  happens often more often than youd think  brian thank you hey whats your name  gillie hi my name is gillie welcome to momocon i have a question for our voice actors of all the  characters you have /none/ voiced major minor side characters is there any one of those you would  play in a campaign and why  matt huh thats an interesting thought  taliesin my answer is cheap im such a superhero nerd and im such a flash nerd and i would love to  do a superhero i used to play champions i built speedsters in champions all the time i loved  playing speedsters  marisha margaret from persona would be cool because she uses the tarot cards and is pretty  badass and powerful yeah shed be awesome she can fly  /none/ matt id say probably kiritsugu emiya from fatezero because hes a combination of a really  awesome and powerful rifleman and assassintype character but has some powerful selfaltering  magics and just has an interesting disposition and moral quandary about his character so hed be a  fun one to roleplay definitely  gillie thank you so much  panel thank you it was a great question  william hey guys its william its been a while since ive seen you  matt good to see you man  william start off with a fun question from the last episode /none/ there were a lot of people in chat  debating how that fight was going to go and who was going to come out on top going into it who  did you guys think was going to win and what were some abilities or items that you were thinking  might come up that didnt  matt okay and lets preface this because some people may not have seen the battle royale on  thursday lets try not to spoil things necessarily well try  marisha eh its hard not to spoil things  matt okay then do what /none/ you will  marisha they knew what they were getting into when they showed up at this panel  william talks machina is usually about the last episode  marisha right i think everyone thought i was going to win  taliesin yeah my money was on you  marisha i think grog and i are actually going to have a rematch because there were a few technical  errors that we both made in an alternate reality grog is at the bottom of the water plane drowning  right now furiously pulling out cards  brian why dont we /none/ just tell them what were going to do tell them what were going to do matt  marisha you want to tell them i think on an episode of talks machina probably pretty soon  were going to do a wwestyle oneonone  cheering  marisha i want to make wrestling closet cosplay versions of our characters outfits find some  green unitard to come out in  brian ill probably wear a tuxedo and be like are you ready well thats copyrighted  matt ill come dressed as paul bearer and be like one of yous going to die /none/  marisha yeah ive already talked to sean becker were going to do some wwestyle promos leading up  to it  brian yeah its going to be fun  matt grog versus keyleth one night only  marisha i feel like we knew that grog and keyleth were going to be the two heavy people  going head to head  taliesin throw down in taldorei  brian we could put it on payperview well thats kind of what alpha is i guess  laughter  william and the second half of that were there any abilities or items /none/ that you were thinking  might come up that didnt in the fight  marisha percy just all of percy  taliesin i rolled so badly i was just staring i rolled three ones two twos and only two rolls  over ten the entire game i was like everythings broken nothings working im paste thats just  what happens  matt the thing is with you as well you and grog both have the highest probability of taking down a  single person in one round of combat you from anywhere on the map and between bad news and /none/ a  wellrolled violent shot you could probably kill any member of the party except for grog in one hit  taliesin ill actually say and also for people who are asking percy doesnt carry the contract  with him i know about the contract and a lot of people were like why didnt you pull it out  that would have not felt percy would not have done that and he doesnt carry it because he  doesnt even want the temptation that thing is locked away i think its locked far away  matt thats fine you dont /none/ have to have it on you to invoke the pact  laughter  matt no you actually do its in the paper  william thank you matt you have a perpetual standing offer  brian hey thats three questions now bro no im kidding  william you have a perpetual standing offer anytime im at a panel if you want to use  frostmourne as a prop or to kill brian foster youre welcome to ask  matt i appreciate the offer however i have played frozen throne and i know better ive seen  what that sword  william /none/ frostmourne is always waiting  matt no man i spent way too long getting shadowmourne okay im having flashbacks  terrible flashbacks  brian hey dude i forgot your name but for sassing me come get a thanks keyleth pin  cheering  matt brian rewards sass  taliesin thank you for encouraging sass  ryan hey guys  matt hey whats your name  ryan my names ryan i didnt say it yesterday but im saying it today so first off spice  brian youve got to eat the mic man we can barely sorry the speaker is not /none/ very loud  there you go thats perfect its perfect  ryan first off spice  matt spice spice  ryan for matt what is your favorite npc to play as for the rest of you what is your favorite npc  to interact with  matt oh man i have a few answers here because its hard to put one in there allura is the most  selfinsertion character i have in the campaign that to me is the most true to myself gilmore is  such a delightful character i love playing as him interacting as him raishan /none/ is such a  delicious villain to play as yeah im not going to say much more than that raishan was an amazing  villain to play so those are my answers  marisha selfishly were going to pick characters that we interact with more sun tree man  laughter  marisha hey sun tree  matt as sun tree thanks kiki  taliesin if im feeling awake and alert which is not every game sometimes im tired victors  always fun but ive got to be prepared  cheering  taliesin i dont want to be tired and dealing /none/ with that because its going to make my head hurt  matt your head hurt  brian thats a good question  ryan taliesin thank you thats my choice too  matt as victor learn from my mistakes  brian hey whats your name  justin my name is justin how are you  matt doing well justin how about yourself  justin i had a quick question for matt i was wondering if you could tell us what your most  memorable moment as a player of dd would be  matt oh man thats a great question id /none/ have to say i was playing a dwarven fighter my first time  playing a combat class because i was always casters named kradin grimthorne who i named the brawlers  league dwarf who ended up representing you guys after i kind of used that character in this one  but it was just playing a really angry tough little son of a bitch at one point we were  climbing down this big ravine where this magical tower was at the bottom that was in the recess to  stay hidden there was somebody in there we had to /none/ talk to so we were climbing down this hundreds  and hundreds of feet with our climbing gear and at that moment we started being assaulted by  wyverns that had nested into the side of this hill as they start running out and swiping down  and attacking the rest of the party is like oh my god we got to go and theyre all climbing  down quickly and trying to get down as fast as they can i was like no i think one of these  can hold my weight im going to wait until one /none/ of them comes for me the dm was like okay you  realize youre still 600 feet up from the bottom of the ravine and im like oh i know so im  just holding my action and holding my action with my hand on the rope and one wyvern swipes in  to strike i take the hits and im like i grapple him all right roll for it i grab on  and i manage to get up onto the wyvern and onto its back and clutch it by the back of the neck and  start trying /none/ to coast it into the side of the ravine to try and control it and knock it a little  dizzy i proceed to roll really well then really poorly then really well and in the process both  of us get bludgeoned by the side of the ravine within an inch of our life eventually getting it  down to the bottom before the rest of the party i actually swoop past them and theyre all  screaming what are you doing im like doing what a dwarf does win i slam it into the bottom  of the /none/ ravine and we both go tumbling over i have three hit points left its on the ground going  snarling its trying to get itself back up and i walk up pull out my ax and im like i win  shwoop and i took its head off as a trophy wore it on my belt for a while it got really stinky i  didnt care i wanted people to see what i did that was grimthorne  justin thank you very much  cheering  brian thats the coolest story ive ever heard in my entire life hey /none/ whats your name  damien im damien or as i introduced myself to you guys yesterday the even more shitty brian  wayne foster  brian thats right all right youre getting a free denise pin when youre done so come up and  grab it after  damien this is my question for matt from one dm to another one of my favorite characters youve  ever introduced was kynan how do you create such realistic and good npcs in your campaign  matt part of what helps with the training of an actor is really what we do /none/ as actors is the study  of human beings and the study of the human condition the complexities of a person so coming  to it from that standpoint when you create an npc you think okay what abilities they have  what classes they are what their background is what faction they work for are they good are  they bad what loot do they have thats the core skeleton but then you consider what are their  passions what are their goals what is it theyre ultimately trying to achieve and how far are they  willing to /none/ go to achieve that then you consider what are their deepest fears what are the things  that drive them to desperation what are the things that drive them to flee what are the  things that drive them to discard allies then you begin to break down subtleties of their history  and their personality really one of the keys you come to is even villains have a reason to how they  got there really good villains are those that you can understand why they became villains it  doesnt mean you have to necessarily feel bad for /none/ them but there is a throughline of going okay i  understand why this individual became who they are many villains dont see themselves as  villains they see themselves as doing whats necessary for the greater good and not realize  the ramifications of their actions so honestly studying characters studying people and a lot of  the basics of creating a character from a performers standpoint can work really well with  the creation of characters for your game that will feel more breathing and living and intricate  in my opinion  brian thats a great answer /none/ thank you very much go ahead whats your name  nick my names nick  brian damien get over here  laughter  taliesin i was going to say  nick so my question is for all of you a little bit of context my character just finished a major  quest and it ended with them at a trial  matt you need to talk a little closer to the mic sir  nick hello  matt there we go  nick so my players just finished a big quest where they were accused of a crime and they /none/ were  trying to prove their innocence well they figured it out and they accused the right person  and at the end of it she was supposed to freak out and scream at the party and go nuts as she was  about to be put to death but when the moment came i flopped i got too nervous to scream at my  players and get in character my question to you guys is as performers and especially as voice  actors how do you guys get into a character and just scream at them and kind of /none/ forget your  nervousness your stage fright especially as voice actors because i mean when you were  symphior you were screaming your head off i dont know how i could have done that how did you  guys get over that  brian did you catch that  matt yeah  taliesin practice  marisha you kind of lose yourself i think a little bit is my mic on  brian can we get the is there someone at the sound booth denise is there someone back there  could we get our microphones in the wedges and then /none/ also the microphone that the people are  asking the questions from isnt really coming out of here very loud so its a little if we can  just get all those up all the way i think cause whenever marisha and taliesin are talking  all i hear is gibberish  marisha im just going to project really loud you kind of i think lose yourself in it a little bit  taliesin one of the things that acting training does one of the first things they do is they sit  down and go all right were going /none/ to work very very hard on removing all of your shame because  youre not going to be able to do your job if you have any of that  audio tech ladies and gentlemen we ask that you please speak up when you ask the questions youre  out in front of the speakers we have to pick it up to send it back to the stage if you talk soft  they cant hear you and i am going to roll your vocal mics into the monitors  all thank you very much  taliesin but yeah removing /none/ that shame is not easy and is a long and arduous process that oh  hello yes thats lovely i wish i had a really good cheat for it other than i started by  performing and getting weird in the car thats a great place to be weird because no one can see  you and then sometimes you notice people see you and then you get okay with that of just singing  something ridiculous kesha is good im trying to think who else theres some good stuff sing to  feel really ridiculous  matt you now /none/ all have the image of taliesin singing kesha to himself in his car  cheering  marisha i mean thats not a bad point though like karaoke going out and dancing in public  thats all little things that can help you get more comfortable with making youre going to  look ridiculous every once in a while and we all will and just embrace that  taliesin and weirdly other peoples reactions to you being ridiculous will slowly make you feel  better because its never going to be the reactions youre afraid of its actually  strangely positive /none/ to be like crazy voice i dont care woo because people go  matt in the same way that youre saying i wish i could let go like we do other people will see  you and go i wish i could let go like you do its a good feedback loop and that just gets you  a little more comfortable with the idea that sometimes that fear you have of people judging  you one doesnt matter two isnt what you think it is and three its a very freeing  experience to just express yourself for the /none/ pure joy of what you want to express  taliesin it takes a while to beat that out of your system though its tough  marisha and weve also been playing these characters for five years now we know them inside  and out we can just drop into them so easily which is why taliesin can improv insane  monologues or why i can scream at raishan and try and just plant myself in keyleths head it  definitely takes time and reckless abandon  matt and at the game table remind yourself that the players that are there /none/ for you are there for  you theyre supportive of you and theyre engaging in the same way you are if youre afraid  about getting that intense about it just remind yourself that they one they will be blown away  when you do manage to cross that threshold and two theyre there to support you and want to see  you get into it as much as you want to as well so you have to remind yourself as best you can that  theyre not going to judge you for it by any means theyre there cheering /none/ you on  marisha and if they do shame on them and find another game group  brian shame  cheering  taliesin thanks mom thats the most mom advice  brian whats your name  elijah is it okay if i take the mic out  brian yeah yeah  matt as long as you put it back  elijah its not moving so im just gonna crouch im sorry because my friends are making me be  this guy but can you say its high noon  groaning  brian oh that is do you have ten thousand /none/ dollars  laughter  elijah if i say yes will you still do it  matt mccree voice oh you know what time it is  cheering  elijah okay thank you  matt mccree voice its high noon  cheering  matt there you go  taliesin i think i just won money on that one  marisha its actually 125  matt mccree voice its 126  elijah so my actual question is recently i got done doing a campaign with one of my friends and  i was playing as a voidling whoever he consumes he takes /none/ on part of their attributes when it  comes to characters like that where they adapt to whoever they kill or consume what type of  hindrances or recoils or feedbacks do you suggest that i implement so hes not just like gilgamesh  from fatestay oh shit lets just throw infinite weapons yay  matt well i mean things that you can consider for balance are if youre gaining attributes of  whatever youve eaten does it replace the attributes that youve previously devoured so the  adaptation could be you only consume and take on the attributes of /none/ what youve currently taken in  thats a balance so its more of an adaptation that switches as opposed to just a constant  building effect or they could be temporary whatever you consume it affects your attributes  for a short period of time and then eventually fades away so you could bulk up and get pretty  powerful for a short time but you can say that if you consume more than three or four entities  within a short period of time it could be damaging or dangerous to your health  taliesin maybe you also get /none/ their lowest attribute as well like no matter what for  whatever bonus you get you get pulled down as well  matt so considering those are possibilities as opposed to just being a character that oh hope  you guys enjoy your longswords im just going to eat the world and become a god  laughter  elijah my character in the beginning everybody just kind of escapes from prison so he  accidentally consumed the heart of a dragon god and its the only attribute that stayed with him  the entire time so is that kind of /none/ fair or am i being kind of being godish  matt i mean its up to you working with the gm on what is fair and what isnt just because you  devour the heart of a dragon god doesnt mean you now have the powers of a dragon god it means you  have the potential to eventually unlock the powers of a dragon god so your journey could be learning  slowly over time how to unlock those abilities so you grow with the rest of the party  taliesin youd just be very insufferable for a while /none/ i imagine that would be fun  matt so yeah there are ways to balance it but the gm has to work with you on that and make sure  that its in line so that it doesnt feel unfair for the rest of the players but you still get to  play through those narrative elements in a way thats fun for you and your character to  progress  elijah all right thank you i didnt get to say my name my name is elijah  matt thank you buddy  brian hey whats your name  joe /none/ hey my name is joe  all hey joe  joe my question is partially twofold for matt the character taryon darrington how far in  advance did you know that he was going to pop up and for everyone else how long did it take you to  get accustomed to him instead of the person that he kind of replaced i dont want to give spoilers  for somebody who hasnt seen it yet  matt yeah well sam and i had discussed taryon for about three weeks about two or three weeks  in advance since the /none/ end of the conclave arc and the scenarios that his character had gone  through that had led him to feel it might be necessary depending on how the conversation goes  with the rest of the party of him to either stay or leave we had made this character as a backup  just in case he decided to leave so we had met and we had designed he told me the theory behind  the character of taryon and what he wanted to him to be and i told him well that kind of fits in  with /none/ these classes and the one he liked best was the artificer he was like oh that sounds  exactly what were trying to do and so hes like i want to be a character that has very  little reallife experience but has enough money to make himself powerful so he became the trust  fund baby of dd characters from a mechanical standpoint taryon without any of his equipment  is like level two but put all of his equipment on and hes level 14 15 was our thought process  behind it he made the character and had /none/ him in the wings and then based on whatever happened  that episode it seemed that sam decided to leave and as such that very same episode we brought  taryon in which i think was a little sooner than sam was anticipating  taliesin he was not prepared he was like oh okay this is apparently happening  marisha you went up to him during the break and you were like all right tary youre up and  he was like what no next week and you were like now  matt you guys went there immediately and it /none/ was a good button for the episode  brian he was looking at his halffilledout papers like what do i do  matt and brian he did great  taliesin it took about three episodes to get really used to i feel like three episodes in i  was like i thought it was good for us because wed been worried about a lot of our players i  think were the only us and liam are the only ones whove actually played any other character  and so i think theres been a little bit of nervousness about whats /none/ going to happen when that  happens and i feel a lot better  marisha yeah people embraced it the first two three games we were rejecting him like a noob  taliesin you are not my father you dont get to tell me what to do  matt good question thank you  brian great question thanks joe hey whats your name  laura hi im laura  all hi laura  laura before i ask my question i just wanted to say thank you to all of you up there except for  brian  laughter  taliesin /none/ its everything i could have hoped for and more  laura i work as a night shift security guard and you guys fill my nights because im way behind  taliesin we are there for you  laura i am way behind on critical role but im working on it ive been sitting at the edge of my  seat waiting for grog to beat that halforc and crying my eyes out during the briarwood arcs  getting super excited with keyleth going through the fire rift it was just so amazing and i just  wanted to thank you /none/ so much for that because it makes my life better  matt thank you for coming along with us  marisha and sticking around for 100 episodes  laura for my question its kind of for all of you but its a twosided question im been dming  my own campaign and i feel like its stagnating a little bit because ive gotten a little frustrated  with my characters with my players matt what do you do when everybody just either gets wonderful  rolls and is just blowing through everything or makes all the right turns over and /none/ over again  even when you want them to go into the wrong way because you want to torture them taliesin and  marisha how do you guys know when youre doing that to matt  matt to answer your question what happens if there is no right way what happens if every path  is the really wrong horrible torturing way  taliesin kobayashi that stuff blow it up  laura and your dragonborn jumps down a pool thats 600 feet and drowns on the way back up  thats what happens  matt exactly and let that be /none/ a lesson to him its a delicate balance being a gm or a dm its  creating challenge without feeling like its unfair and not challenging them all the time  because you want the players to also have time where they feel like theyre having a good time  or theyre kicking ass and enjoying the battle as opposed to always being under the threat of  constant bludgeoning death you have to find that balance  brian like taliesin just said about consequence versus punishment too tell these people that  because we were in a room with /none/ different people  taliesin we were in a press room a good dm in my opinion knows the difference between  consequence and punishment you dont punish your players for making the wrong decision you dont  punish them for going off the rails you dont punish them for staying on the rails you create  consequence there was a guy up a second ago who was talking about that all his players got accused  falsely of a crime and then they found the real guilty person and dealt with it he was talking  about that what if /none/ most of the world still doesnt know they found the right person and just  all assumes that theyre guilty and still got off and just treats them like dirt for months that  would be amazing and now theyre just ostracized and everybody hates them  matt i was about to say what if they get to the guilty person and the guilty person kills  themself and theyre found with the dead body of the guilty party with no way of proving innocence  and they have another body on their hands to now have to flee the /town/ town  brian youve thought about this  taliesin make life be unfair like just be unfair dont be mean but you can stack the odds  against them i love no right answer kobayashi that terrible situations where something awful is  going to happen no matter what  matt and remember if theyre always rolling well and theyre always just blowing through every  encounter throw a couple tarrasques at them  laughter  marisha what are you two talking about  matt its called teaching humility  brian wow wow all right laura come up here cause /none/ you got the how do you want to do this pin  signed by  cheering  matt you look awesome by the way  rob hello  matt hello whats your name sir  rob my names rob  matt rob hello  rob matt thank you so much for bringing all of your friends here glad you came last year glad  you brought more of the crew and brian i dont know what problem laura had with you im so glad  that you and your hair are here you put on your beard today  brian /none/ thank you yes its velcroed on thank you thats really sweet  rob you pull it off every night before you go to sleep  laughter  taliesin theyre learning im so proud theyre learning  brian let me see what this guys gets hold on let me get my wallet out there all right youll  get a free denise pin too after  rob my question is to golden gods and life needs things to live i know you guys started this game  back in pathfinder and transitioned to fifth edition where it rewards you for coming /none/ up with  every little thing about your character personality traits flaws bonds ideals and  such but over the course of the game you tend to discover more things about your character than  were there in the beginning so what is something that while playing under matt has surprised you  about the character that you created  matt thats a cool question  brian thats a fantastic question  marisha especially kind of like we were saying weve been playing these characters for so long  that theyre having the life of people i know ive probably /none/ changed a lot in five years and  these people are put in very extreme circumstances so i think you just have to be open  to that we all have our core values that we stick to and then you have to let the world still  affect you  taliesin your reality with kerrek i remember changed your whole plotting quite a bit you were  getting kind of aggro  marisha yeah there was a time where because when i started keyleth she was naive and juvenile  and just thought that the whole world was like /none/ a magical disney forest filled with animals and  things that loved me and then the reality is thats not the case at all and there for a while  she was getting very angry because that was just the way the world was beating down upon us for a  while getting angry at the fact that why did no one tell her about this and it wasnt until kerr  stepped in as that substitute father figure to and at the time vox machina you guys were being  total dicks to keyleth you were like deal with /none/ it druid you were  taliesin oh no i remember  marisha and he was the first one who because thats when she was having panics about were  not heroes look at the trail of destruction weve left behind us and he was the first one to  relate to keyleth on that level so there were several things there was dealing with the fact  that i felt like my party wasnt really supporting keyleth at the time that my people who were  supposed to be my closest friends and then there was this guy who was /none/ just a guest who came in for  an episode who totally changed everything because i was getting really heavy into almost dropping  points of barbarian into keyleth and having her be like screw it im done im done with all of  this why do we need to do any and just get angry but then he put her back on that track  which was good  taliesin i call your current track in my head its the be the lisa frank you want to see in the world  laughter  taliesin come on guys its /none/ pretty good  marisha lets make a more rainbow tomorrow  taliesin hey sun tree yeah one of my core principles i like that dd has those little  fifth edition boxes but i always see that as either and theres nothing wrong with training  wheels we all need them as a good way of helping you be  brian theres nothing wrong with training wheels  taliesin theres nothing wrong with training wheels sometimes if you havent been acting for  30 years its nice to have a box that teaches you some basics or if youre playing /none/ a oneshot its  a good way of remembering who you are and what youre doing which is important for anybody but  ive never filled those boxes out for percy at all i dont think any of us filled any of those  boxes out  matt by the time wed gotten over the edition transition you knew the characters so well and  what those were you didnt need to  taliesin unless im playing a oneshot i never fill those out anyway  marisha one of the best times ive seen those boxes utilized though those background /none/ boxes  was with dan casey on the oneshot that you did i think it was episode 12 i think thats still out  there we watched dan casey roll because theyre all numbered to where you can roll a d8 so if  youre really confused and you dont know you can roll a d8 and be like four okay im paranoid  of water so he rolled found the things and then came up with a backstory and that was how he  got salty pete who was a dualwielding pirate sellsword  taliesin its a great episode /none/  marisha it was a great character with a background that he didnt get so stuck and caught  on what it was going to be that it didnt allow him to still have fun  rob that was the first episode with the snugglelord right  all yes it was  marisha when you were walking people through  taliesin yeah percy was supposed to never be happy that was one of his core character traits  is somebody who will never be happy with himself or the world around him and will always be on a  core /none/ level irritated at himself and others mostly himself and not anymore i was like what  happens if he just lets that go finally and is like fine forget it i deserve a little  happiness hes getting dangerous im enjoying it somethings going to snap terribly im really excited  matt happy percy is a bad idea  marisha its true your sorrow contained you  taliesin yeah all it took was a bad relationship a really inappropriate relationship  to ruin everything im so excited  matt thats usually how it works though in real life  taliesin /none/ oh no it really is its such a flashback to 22 23 its great  brian thats a great question come collect your pin please  matt hello again  lee hello my names lee  matt hi lee  lee last night i told you guys about my drow sorcerer who is currently a potted plant  marisha oh thats right speak with plants  lee yeah so thats fine i have a question for matt how long have you sat on the major events  for vox machina the briarwoods the chroma conclave whatever were going to get /none/ with the orb  of doom how long have you been sitting on these and waiting  matt the briarwoods ive been sitting on since percy gave me his character backstory the minute  he turned that page in and i read it i was like oh this is going to be so sweet when we get to  it its going to be so good the conclave ive been sitting on for about two years before i  dropped on that because when i began to develop them my main reason for doing the conclave was  id been /none/ dming for so many years and i just didnt use dragons this game is called dungeons   dragons and i never got around to really using big ancient dragons ive always wanted to do that  brian why because you never played long enough for the campaigns to  matt because some campaigns ended before i could get to that power level i didnt want it being  like oh youre fighting a baby dragon ooh i wanted big scary classic dragons but the  campaigns didnt go on long enough or thematically the dragons didnt fit for it /none/ the  villains and the world where they were it would have felt shoehorned if i put them in there so i  was like im not just going to bring a dragon im going to bring all of them in bring one of  each chromatic dragon i decided that would be a conclave but they would never work together what  would bring them together it would be the one the dominant the alpha essentially which is the  thordak character and raishan being the sly manipulator and the combination of those two  would make it a /none/ tenuous agreement between this conclave i developed this and realized in order  for this to be impactful it has to be at a time when theyre at the height of their success when  it feels like everything is fine and good so i sat on it and i set the scene i began to plant  the seeds of its eventual release and then waited for them to complete a series of arcs  taliesin waiting for liam to make that speech that was amazing  matt that was amazing im sitting here like theyre back in emon /none/ they had their celebration  they were all lauded before the people of emon they were having a crisis an existential crisis  of what do we do now what holds us together what are we what purpose do we have are we still  adventurers have we done any good in the world i dont know whats going on  marisha because arguably if theres no adventuring for vox machina were just a group of  shitty people  brian who eat douchebags for breakfast  taliesin thats the next tshirt just a group of shitty people  marisha /none/ the adventuring has to be happening or were just awful  matt to be fair so is most any adventuring party and i think you can all attest to that  taliesin oh yeah tary points it out a lot which i really enjoy of like youre terrible people  yes we are woo  matt so yeah it takes a lot of patience to sit on a story that long i remember that episode when  liam said that when hes like what are we going to do whats next i feel like theres no  purpose im like /none/ ooh man give me like 40 minutes  laughter  matt so yeah that was amazing  brian great question  matt the sphere thing is coming to fruition slowly now and ive been sitting on that since i  was designing the briarwood arc  taliesin long time  matt that one ive probably been sitting on the longest  taliesin i was about to say maybe the sphere is not going to come up until the next campaign for  all we know i have no idea  matt yeah well see where it comes up  lee /none/ all right thanks  brian such a tease hello whats your name  christen my names christen  matt hi christen  christen hello  taliesin bend it to your will there you go  matt you look awesome by the way  christen thank you the question is technically for all of yall if you could choose another  class besides the one that your character is what would it have done and how do you think it would  have affected their progression  marisha oh interesting same characters different class  matt player thats my class  /none/ laughter  taliesin oh just a player nice i think maybe if percy had never become an engineer i would  have loved to have stayed in fighter class but maybe a fighter class and become like a really  poncy fencer which would have been in the errol flynn style ha ha just cant build anything i  dont know because he thinks magics weird the rules are all mishmosh  marisha i dont know i was mentioning earlier if i wouldve dropped points of barbarian in keyleth  and gone a halfandhalf route then gone more of a /none/ melee brawler because i could rage and go into  my beast shaping forms and then get all the bonus that grog gets when he rages so it would be nasty  and awesome but she would have gone off the rails i think it would have caused a lot of her  i dont think it would have been attractive on her it would be keyleth as a nihilist i dont know  taliesin you would be an angry nineyear old  marisha yeah she would have been like whats it all matter meh  taliesin and marisha somewhere /none/ in the darkest timeline  laughter  matt thank you  christen thank yall thank you  brian hey whats your name  stephanie hello my name is stephanie  cast hi stephanie  taliesin nice chunli  marisha aww youre so cute  stephanie dont make me blush come on  laughter  stephanie all right my question is for brian but it could also be answered for all of you guys too  matt only for brian  brian are you in law enforcement  stephanie spoilers this is spoilers its from thursdays episode when grog pulled out /none/ the deck  of many things what was your reaction since we clearly saw matt marisha and taliesins reactions  on twitch  brian so ive known travis for almost ten years and i know him so well well hang out not doing  anything related to critical role and the deck comes up i would say every 20 minutes  laughter  brian ill be talking to travis about football or a movie or something and then youll start to see  this drifting happen sometimes if lauras there shell say are you thinking about the deck  hes /none/ obsessed with this deck thing the battle royale is one thing i am really interested to see  what happens in the real game  taliesin its not that were nervous about grog having the deck if anything its that were  nervous about travis having the deck  brian thats exactly right thats what terrifies me if you tell travis theres a poisonous snake  inside this thing of red bull he will bite it in half drink all of the red bull and not touch the  snake and go well if i dont get poisoned its 5050 /none/ i could win i could lose he always  plays the odds and thats why the deck hes so obsessed with it because he goes it could  either go perfectly something could be great we could have a great weapon or something come out  or everybody dies if everyone dies right in the middle of keyleths were gods were dead  because of the stupid deck i cant wait to see what happens i hope its a tpk  matt when i rolled the decks i was like im never putting any of this in a campaign it /none/ ruins  the narrative then i rolled it on a random treasure table when they defeated thordak i was  like sighs well its the smaller version of the deck so it doesnt have the super worldending  cards still pretty awful usually its laura or percy that investigates the treasure hoard first  so at least i know a player with some intelligence is going to find it so that went well he rushed  there first and rolled so high i was like well okay here we go  brian ill tell you a funny behindthescenes story that /none/ night with the deck all of us near the  control center where all the smart people sit they let me sit by them when the deck thing  happened one of the producers eddie who wears headphones and is deep into the computer but he  knows everything there is to know about dd a lot of us didnt know the deck was a lot of us  backstage were why is everyone freaking out because liam was going and then everyone else  was just whatever i was just sitting there and then they were like oh is /none/ there a deck is  there a whatever you know then everybodys telling me it looks like its actually going to  come into the game eddie threw his headphones off and was like  laughter  taliesin i can see that so clearly in my head  brian i googled so fast then they have the list of what each of the and i was like okay oh my  god my first thought was travis  taliesin i think the deck in the battle royale was my fault because every game i distribute  we get a lot /none/ of mail its mostly in my room i live in it now theres more mail in my room than  furniture its one of the reasons i dont livestream very often anymore i look like a hobo  brian hes like scrooge mcduck except with envelopes  taliesin yeah except its just paper im like ah papercuts god i distribute a little of it  every week and that deck that he had that is what i had given him i was like here youre  going to dig this and i gave him the deck with the letter it /none/ might not have been in his  consciousness if i hadnt handed him a physical deck  matt well its fine because his use of the deck in the battle royale was a safe place to use it  and to learn that there are a lot of consequences or not he pulled the cards with no consequences  marisha you sound like a begrudging father trying his best to give a sex ed talk like it was a  safe place to learn the consequences  taliesin so you lock the kid in his room with a crate of /none/ scotch and open it an hour later the  scotch is gone and hes like i feel great youre like that did not work  marisha well and the other crazy thing is because he was like i pull five cards and i  was like what matt and i were looking at the rules and in the book they dont state that there  is a limit to how many cards you can draw in a turn so now i have this nightmarish image in my  head of grog doing like a card flourish and 52 card pickup /none/ of the deck of many things  matt exandria goes poof gone  taliesin if you cant tell we talk about this a lot this is a subject of conversation i feel  bad weve actually held the line now sorry  stephanie thank you so much  brian thank you for addressing it to me and making me feel like i have a purpose in this world  stephanie but youre awesome  brian im just kidding i know  taliesin dont encourage him  brian look at this beard im just kidding  taliesin i meant to wake /none/ up and shave it this morning i feel really bad about it  brian you tried but i had the deadbolt locked go ahead  melissa hello  brian hey whats your name  melissa hi im melissa  brian hey melissa  melissa hi im a firsttime gm for a pathfinder game  matt awesome  melissa ive noticed how hard that was when i first started as my very first game to gm but im  also taking improv classes to get better at gming i have a question for all you guys as professional  actors theres /dung/ a longform improv format created by mark meer its like a longform improvised dd  format have you guys been interested in actually doing something similar like putting dungeons   dragons on a stage rather than through a stream  matt well its funny that you mention that not in a stream per se but years ago  theres a  longrunning show in los angeles called dungeon master that was just that still going a lot of  our friends ran it and so a few of us would be guests on it occasionally  taliesin i guested /dung/ a couple times on dungeon master then there was a scifi spin off that we  did for several years  matt called adventure the three of us were all cast members wed all every week was a  different storyline a continuation of last weeks storyline we all the cast played different npcs  with costumes and set pieces and then five people from the audience would be pulled up as player characters  taliesin they would be in costume with character sheets that theyd filled out and they would play  through the game and we would be /none/ the npcs  marisha yeah and we would generally like get them killed or something horrible  matt the characters not the people none  of this is legally binding you heard nothing  marisha no one was harmed during the making of adventure  matt erase the tape  taliesin it was a pretty solid there was some great stuff you in the evil disney world was one  of my favorites she played a psychotic murderous tinkerbell with a baby in a bag that she would  beat on the ground to get peoples attention it was amazing /dung/ it was one of the best things ive  ever seen in my it was so hard to keep my shit together with you with a shank and the baby in a  bag the makeup smeared  marisha out of context this sounds awful  taliesin everybody smile oh it was so good  brian id pay five dollars extra a month to watch that show  laughter  taliesin it was an amazing show  marisha it was good it was good fun  matt it was a lot of fun stuff  taliesin is dungeon master still /dung/ running  matt yeah dungeon master is still running  marisha yeah so if youre ever in la you can check out a dungeon master show  taliesin they put stuff on youtube every now and then too  melissa very cool thank you guys  brian okay i think this is our last question  groaning  brian well i dont know normally theres people that hold up a sign and then they give you  an angry look  taliesin they havent done that yet  brian maybe we just keep going all right this guys waiting sorry /none/ guys we tried go ahead  brendan hi im brendan  matt whats your question  brendan i was going to ask what your favorite character arcs are besides your own so not the  briarwoods the aramente or the chroma conclave for brian your favorite character arc  taliesin fire plane fire plane for me  marisha yeah all the raven queen stuff it was cool  matt i was actually going to say that because he was planning to go paladin of sarenrae through a  chance resurrection ritual the death of his sister and a spontaneous pledge /none/ he made as that  process led his path entirely different to instead pursue the path of the raven queen this is the  reason i love dd you cant plan for that a couple of die rolls and a spontaneous character  choices and an entire characters planned destiny that you thought they had goes in another  direction and now youre following that element i thought was a really cool switch  brian the end of scanlans arc before he left i think it made sam and i closer as friends because  of my past we got /none/ to have a lot of conversations about something that he didnt really have any  experience in because hes a green baby with no he doesnt live on the edge like me i would say  that arc really was powerful and that speech he made at the end i still think about that as  character work and as a piece of acting that was insane in my opinion  taliesin yeah definitely we were not prepared  brian thank you very much all right one more  marisha make it good  audience member this is somewhat for /none/ matt and also for marisha and taliesin matt as a dm whose  characters went 180 degrees i had to create a combat encounter map off the top of my head what  is your favorite dm recovery moment of going like oh shit i had not planned for this what can i  do for you guys what is your favorite moment of you knowing you screwed up plans somewhat and  watching him stumble  taliesin we cant tell he doesnt flinch hes like that guy who can hold his hand over a candle  and maintain eye /none/ contact  marisha yeah we never see him stumble we never know if were doing something off the rails where  were just going and shit  taliesin it didnt even occur to me that that pub crawl was going to be out of his like he was  going to have to pull that out of nowhere until like an hour and a half into it im like oh god  marisha im still pretty partial to vex and keyleth and laura and marisha being like screw  you guys when you guys didnt want us to go off /none/ in the underdark in the very beginning  taliesin oh that was great on the carpet  marisha then we went and found clarota which i dont think we were supposed to find him that  soon or ever potentially finding clarota that was cool  matt yeah that was fun that was definitely one of the big offthrows like okay well this is  an npc that they probably werent going to meet or if they were going to meet it was going to be  much later and it was probably just going to be a battle but /none/ they convinced to join them they now  have an actual arcane magicusing mindflayer in their party sure actually ive thought about  this recently i forgot about it but when they were in the moonbrush in the feywild i was not  expecting you guys to side with the werewolves  marisha oh yeah  matt you guys came in and fought and slaughtered the pixies that was fully improvised that was  fully like okay lets do this you guys are going to kill a bunch of pixies against the trees  marisha they were mean pixies  /none/ matt oh yeah well pixies are generally not you hear pixies like aww thats so cute theyre beautiful  taliesin no  matt theyre also kind of dicks most things that are fey are they are selfish little entities that  expect things to work however they want  marisha and vox machina is also a selfish entity that gets very defensive and takes things personally  matt when an unstoppable force meets an immovable wall those are a few examples there definitely  good question  audience member i just want to give you this  all okay  /none/ taliesin hand it to brian because its always funnier  brian this is a subpoena yeah we have a signing so bring everything to the signing or  give it to ginny if youre not coming to the signing  marisha thats ginny youll see her shell know  taliesin she knows where we are at all times  audience member marisha before you go please cast regenerate on tyriok give him his arm back please  marisha oh hes fine  audience member come on hes right there  marisha hes fine it gives him character  taliesin he /none/ wears it well  matt it wasnt his drawing arm  taliesin if anything i think it makes his maps a little better hes trying harder oh god im so  mean i know i feel bad about that arm i do  marisha i do feel a little bad i should probably fix that  taliesin i could build him something  marisha you could make him a mechanical arm  taliesin ill make him a robot arm  marisha thats way cooler than a real arm  matt this is your other legacy firearms and prosthetics thats what /none/ percy has done in exandria  taliesin ive made really nice roads its true the roads in whitestone are great now  marisha oh yeah i cant believe you made heated roads  matt well theyre starting to its going to take a while  taliesin its going to take a while but weve already got several of the main throughways its great  matt thank you guys so much for coming  brian thank you guys
