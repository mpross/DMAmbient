none	 maybe pending  taliesin could be  marisha we got really close  matt i go by recklessrobbie on most things internet and artthroughflame on etsy travis  seemed to enjoy the last one of these i made this is the guy that made the last one with him  screaming vax so i figured id make another one thats continuing thank you for this  amazingness that is critical role i didnt make one for any particular member of the group so if  there isnt a spot for it in the studio then the cast will simply have 
none	 to fight over it oh no  well find a place for it  taliesin that will hit talks  matt that is so cool  taliesin this is why i love the talks set because we can  matt quite literally if you have another battle royale in the horizon have the winner choose who  gets it i do kind of like that  brian thats a good idea  matt well see if theres a place on the set and if not well do just that  marisha i think were going to be getting an upgrade 
none	 soon  taliesin yeah the set will be upgraded hopefully  brian matt before i forget the person who sent the mugs over said to find the big ones so to  find yours because its different its special its different dont let me forget that  marisha its like a shield  taliesin you got it or should i get it  matt yeah it is straightup a shield  brian oh god everythings fine it is a shield thorin oakenshield  marisha shouting this is vox machina  taliesin thats such an adventure show flashback i dont know 
dung	 if that made me happy or sad matt  marisha and i used to do improv together  marisha thats true  matt i wasnt sure if i was going to get a box thats awesome it says vox machina it has the  symbol on the other side it says dungeon master of a thousand voices and it has a skull and crossbones  marisha motherfuck thats awesome  taliesin holy cow  marisha wow  matt man this is going to come out so it can stay in the kitchen  marisha all right so  taliesin two 
none	 more to go this insane saving that for last okay  matt wait you know what lets do that one now to preface this  taliesin is this the one that got left forever  matt no this is the one that was at the post box  taliesin oh yeah no one had a car big enough to pick up  matt yeah and we had to particularly get it in our vehicle  brian oh my gosh  matt it is labeled with many fragile stickers  taliesin well see if that actually  matt as soon as 
none	 you picked it up today it was like parts moving it has many small pieces  moving inside so theres a little part of me thats feeling really anxious about this  brian hopefully were good  matt hopefully were good  marisha maybe its  matt whatever it is ill fix it if its not there but hold that for a second  taliesin i got it  matt i literally went to pick up today and i was like oh no please no  brian i hope its a painting of sam laying down in the naked burt 
none	 reynolds pose  marisha that would be amazing  brian marisha oakenshield they say  taliesin i think it may be fine it may have just been glass  brian matts mug comes with the players tears  matt i get the sense based on the audio that perhaps fedex did not treat the box as kindly as you  would have hoped  marisha wow thats really big  matt its huge  taliesin i would say be careful because theres probably going to be a bag of glass i get that feeling  matt theres a letter in 
none	 here that says  taliesin that might be the thing it might have just been a big sound bag going crinkle crinkle  matt to matt and marisha  brian oh  marisha this is to us oh jesus  taliesin its a painting of a horse head because they figured you didnt have room  matt hey sun tree hey kiki dear matt and marisha id like to donate a framed poster of vox  machina to you i ordered it and it was a bit damaged on the edges so geek and sundry sent me a  replacement 
none	 i had them both framed hung one on my wall and decided to send the other back to you  and perhaps auction it for charity whatever you like especially yours jason morrison is it  thursday yet jasonofarabia  marisha oh jason  brian thank you jason jasonofarabia  taliesin all right lets we can definitely leave this  matt yeah we can leave it out  taliesin yeah well keep cutting  matt its thick plastic  marisha whoa that scared the shit out of me  brian tukroll in the house  taliesin i should probably get 
none	 out of the way here there are layers  marisha therere several layers  taliesin surprised laughter oh yeah the glass did not do well  matt but thats okay  all the poster survived  matt i feel like we shouldnt open it entirely because the more we dont open the higher the  chance we can we will get this reframed  taliesin were going to have to very gently get this out of here  marisha this is amazing aw thank you thanks for sending it for our wedding especially since  we didnt get one of 
none	 those we didnt get one so thats awesome  matt we didnt get one the framed one  brian whats the poster of  matt its our actual poster  brian oh its the big one  marisha the big joe mad one  taliesin the signed edition we didnt think through enough to get one for ourselves  matt i actually want to make a really good charity gift or something  marisha that might also be a great talks machina or yeah  matt yeah well get that fixed  brian obviously glenn works for fedex  marisha 
none	 oh god damn it glenn fucking glenn  matt i wouldnt trust glenn with anything fuck that guy  brian fedex rolled a natural one  taliesin yeah thats theres a couple of little ones left in there i think but theyre  mostly letters and we tend not to do although theres anything thats packagesized  marisha a few letters we got letters from  matt say who theyre from so that we dont have to take too much longer  marisha from john cox seth taylor lee teetsle i heard that  brian i love names you know

none	 we did the oldschool hollywood theyre killing them by the  thousands out there  matt but no this is great which by the way guys ive actually downloaded this already  jamie in preparation for these types of things not with these specific creations of course  here but this is awesome if you guys havent seen it on the dms guild this is a really good  way to help or break the largescale armyversusarmy combat dd without being a  billion dice rolls and bog down the actual narrative so thank you so much its awesome
