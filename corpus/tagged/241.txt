none	 and make friends with a very young kenku named kiri  who has been accompanying you through your journey thus far you managed to find an individual who  could guide you through the swamp who was summarily taken and probably eaten by a troll that  was stalking you through the swamp you found an ally named cali calianna who was a  dragonblooded sorcerer who seemed to have aligned interests towards the direction you were traveling  to find the safe house that belonged to the gentleman that had gone quiet upon hearing that  there had been 
none	 some sort of attack on it all of you went through the swamp forded the dangers  made your way to the base of the tree where it was discovered to be within and below the base of  this large banyan tree on the northern side of the labenda swamp  laura is it called a bangin tree  matt banyan its a bangin tree just want you to know of all the trees ive seen its pretty  bangin after investigating the scene and trying to pick up details about what had transpired you  found a number 
none	 of bodies that had been put up left to bloat and die as a warning for those who  had made their way in on the inside it looks like the interior of the safe house had been  cleaned out and summarily dragged through a subterranean tunnel following this tunnel down  below you found strange twistedlooking merfolk called merrow that seemed to have been living in  these partially submerged tunnels this system beneath the swamp you engaged in battle killed a  number of them and upon sifting through some of the remnants of what was dragged 
none	 out of the safe  house you discovered calis quarry which was a bowl that could speak to the scaled tyrant  tiamat you decided what to do and after a brief confrontation the bowl was handed over to yasha  who attempted to sunder it using her magician’s judge which succeeded the item was left  shattered into pieces cali with her quest complete and not wishing to put herself into any  further danger decided to leave bidding you all adieu and clambered back up through the strange  dug tunnel that leads to the surface you guys 
none	 were left to think about what the next course of  action was before fjord made a brief swimming excursion into one of the faroff tunnels that led  to a larger chamber and a base of operations where more of these merrow live from the outskirts of  what you could see more remnants of what was taken from the safe house existed further in  mighty nein youve seen cali clamber off you guys have taken down from the heat of the moment  what do you wish to do  travis we got to rest up right 
none	  marisha yeah im a little tired  laura we should probably sleep  sam but theres fish men and possibly fish women right down there that could come out and kill us  in our sleep  travis i think caleb has a little booby trap for that dont you  liam caleb starts silver threading the entrance that fjord swam through  taliesin i say we sleep upstairs  laura upstairs  taliesin pull the rope up that way well have plenty of time if we hear them coming back up  travis add some distance yeah  
none	 laura and travis okay okay okay  sam what if theres unlimited numbers of them what if theres a whole  travis i only saw like five  sam you only saw like five did you keep going down into the tunnels  travis no but i got pretty fucking sharp eyes all right they call me eagleeye fjord where i  come from  laura did they really  travis cawing crow fjord or maybe raven you dont know  marisha thats a lot of nicknames  travis it is  taliesin with the warning system well have plenty 
none	 of time to get away if theres too many of  them and theyll have no way up if we pull the rope up  laura well what will we put in the doorway of the tree though  travis i dont know if we leave the tree  laura no are we sleeping in the tree  travis yeah  taliesin people will keep watch  laura oh okay  taliesin that way well have an early warning before they even manage to crawl their way up  travis and we know where the entrance is  liam the 
none	 moment that they exit the pool well know and it would wake me up or you up or  anybody up  sam were just going to gloss over the fact that fjord has three bird nicknames  laura birdeye fjord i think is what he was getting at you know  travis also very popular  matt kiri pipes up like jester birdeye fjord  travis thats right kiri birdeye fjord  matt like jester birdeye fjord  travis its sticking  matt like fjord sticking  sam that does not sound good  marisha can we call you 
none	 bef for short birdeye fjord  travis no we make our way up the rope into the bottom of the tree but the entrance is still open  matt okay as you guys are making your way up and climbing using the roots and the rope and the  interior you begin to now that youre not focused on what’s below notice that a lot of the  earth in this particular tunnel that isnt too wide necessarily its about three feet wide in  most places you can see the claw marks where its been dug out the softer 
none	 portion of the  ground where you landed upon emerging from making your way down you can see a lot of the earth and chunks of  root that have been carved out it wasnt a natural tunnel or something they discovered they dug up  into the safe house to retrieve whatever was inside nevertheless you all make your way up  into the hollow base of the safe house tree you guys can set up camp if youd like to  travis ill take first watch if you want i can post up outside and do a little 
none	 illusion work  marisha ill join you  laura im going to spend a little time with kiri i want to teach you some sayings how long can you  keep mimicking things  matt like jester mimicking things  laura im going to take that as a long time  matt like jester long time  laura okay good im going to tell you if someone asks what your name is you say i am kiri  matt like jester i am kiri  laura see look at this this is great okay and then if they go are 
none	 you nice you say yes  im very sweet  matt like jester yes im very sweet  laura if they say something you dont like you say go fuck yourself  matt like jester go fuck yourself  laura yes  travis oh my god i cant believe you said it  sam its like a sound board  travis go fuck yourself  laura you say fuck yourself  matt like jester go fuck yourself  laura yes thats good okay thats a good start  sam wait if you get really excited you should go air horn 
none	 blaring  matt air horn blaring  laura oh no dont do that kiri dont  liam frumpkins hair gets poofed out and his tail floofs out and he starts growling at the sound  marisha hey fjord  travis yeah  sam are we going to sleep  laura i think so  travis about what time is it anyway light still coming in from the outside of the tree  matt at this point its probably just past dusk theres a little bit of blue cresting into night  time lights coming through the trees but it looks 
none	 like youre about half an hour out from a  pitch black sky  travis all right  liam is it my turn with the dodecahedron  laura oh yes do you want it  liam i do  sam for today  laura but wait for the morning unless you want to use it today and then somebody else will get  it in the morning because it only lasts for 24 hours  liam did you use it  sam i did not oh i did we have to save it for tomorrow  liam i more want 
none	 to examine it  laura oh yes here do you want to take it out of the bag  liam no can i borrow the bag  laura heres the bag  liam im going to spend maybe a halfhour before bed not trying to use it but just examine it  matt okay make an arcana check  liam 15  matt okay assessing its design paying attention to its construct and the handles and the edging  of where the different facets of it are affixed to this cagelike exterior to it you really have no  idea 
none	 what material its made from the faint magical essence that comes off of it and with the  training you have had across the various schools of magic this seems hard to pin down youre not  sure the source of its magic but it does seem very old it seems like its been shaped or its  been polished from whatever its raw form was at one point in time  liam well this evening im going to use it for the grand purpose of being my pillow in the bag  so im going to sleep  matt 
none	 okay  liam it’s in the bag  laura whispers i’m putting it back on my body  liam does my head do this  laura oh you were sleeping on it  matt yeah using it as a pillow  laura just kidding  marisha hey fjord  travis yep  marisha let me ask you something  travis shoot  marisha i think i messed up i think maybe i should apologize to caleb im not very good at  apologizing though i was wondering if maybe you could give me some pointers for apologizing  travis youre 
none	 not good at apologizing  marisha youre being facetious arent you  travis yeah im fucking with you you reckon you need to apologize  marisha i probably got a little too aggressive probably shouldnt have grabbed him like that got  a little too angry thats not necessarily my good side you know dont like people seeing that  travis you know a great place to start with apologies is to mention the stuff you just said  marisha that im not good at apologies  travis no after that right  marisha i got a little too aggressive 
none	  travis one  marisha and i have a bad side  travis dos  marisha and i shouldnt have done it  travis yeah thats a really good apology  marisha is that pretty good  travis yeah however right be genuine dont be embarrassed to apologize it takes a big person to  apologize for something little people are the ones that make mistakes and just let them go  marisha oh like nott a little person  travis no like small on the inside  marisha right like in your soul  travis thats big of you 
none	  marisha its you know i want to try i guess  travis yeah i think he deserves that hes been good to us  marisha yeah i think so  travis all right  marisha hopefully it goes well  travis i think it will you can actually leave the smile out of it this time just to be clear  marisha oh okay not like im sorry  travis no thats going to set the tone in a real weird way theres a thing called sarcasm that you  ride a line with sometimes  marisha okay thats 
none	 good to know  matt all right the rest of you find yourselves to sleep or is there anything else you wish to do  before the night’s done any order of taking watch or are you all just resting under the  protection of calebs silver thread  travis no beau and i are up first  laura ill do second  matt okay  sam second as well  matt well say that was for your first watch while you guys are having that conversation one  of you roll with advantage on your perception check or you 
none	 can both roll separately your call  marisha lets roll separately oof terrible  travis yep five  marisha five  matt oh leave him hanging  laura her perception is low you wouldnt see the high five  matt thats true  marisha five oh five  matt good incharacter moment there  as you guys are finishing your conversation your watch comes to an end without incident  travis with an arrow in our throat i didn’t see choking  matt you rest so easily with the blood leaking out you finish your watch you wake up nott 
dung	 and  jester and you guys take on your second watch do you want to both make a roll for perception or  laura lets roll separately  matt okay worked out great last time  laura yeah  sam thats a four  laura oh no i think its 12 for me  matt okay  sam high roll  matt while you guys are taking some time concentrating on listening out for anything and feeling pretty  solid in your ability to maintain vigil across this dark eerie night in the center of this  hollow tree you 
none	 dont hear or see a goddamned thing but a little twinkle hits your ears caleb  sam oh shit  matt as suddenly something down below by the pool on the opposite end of that kidneyshaped  interior cavern seems to go off  liam im awake  matt yes you come to consciousness  liam theyre awake  matt they are awake  liam ah fish nott  sam no were on watch we havent seen anything its just a dream  liam no down below in my  laura in the cavern in the tunnel  liam yeah 
none	  laura what should we do should we wake everyone up  sam we should wake everyone up  liam wake up  marisha ow  laura wake up  sam fjord cawing  travis what what  sam dont wake up kiri though she deserves a really nice nights sleep  laura she really does let her sleep  matt shes all curled up in the corner like trilling with her feathers all poofed up  sam im going to give her my blanket  liam im going to send frumpkin to crawl down and get a look  
none	 matt okay roll a stealth check for frumpkin  laura does frumpkin fall down the tunnel then  matt cats can do some pretty crazy shit  liam it’s fine good four  matt okay frumpkin drops down onto the soft and makes it around focusing on it you can see that  another merrow has emerged into that chamber and nope  laura we didnt hide the bodies  matt goes around and sees the bodies there lying in the middle of the space he growls  liam oh we left the corpses out  laura oops  matt 
none	 he goes and drags him back a little bit begins rifling through whatever it might have had  and looks over right at frumpkin grabs the trident spear and throws it  laura did you snap him out  liam i dont know  matt you werent close enough to do that i dont think  liam no 100 feet  matt 100 feet to snap him back or is it shorter than that doublecheck on that real fast  laura oh again again  taliesin kitten kebab  sam i remember saying that we should hide the corpses and 
none	 cali actually said dont do it  theres no point to it so we should blame cali  laura i dont remember cali saying that  sam thats what cali said  liam i actually have no memory of anything on range for bamfing in and out but i will defer to  you because youre my dm  matt as an action you can temporarily dismiss your familiar it doesnt say range you can  cause it to reappear within 30 feet of you thats what i forgot so you can do that the last  thing you see 
none	 briefly before frumpkin vanishes is this threepronged trident rocking through the  darkness with what faint little bit of visibility that frumpkin has not even being able to see much  down there in the darkness before disappearing  liam ja there is one down there right now and he tried to kill my cat  laura should we go down there or should we stay up here  travis hit the wall against the hole right well take either side of it either flank  sam why dont we just blow up the hole  travis no because we 
none	 still want to go down there  sam why do we want to go down there theres crazy people down there  laura nott shut up because theres treasure and stuff  sam you could just say be quiet  laura nott please be quiet  sam thank you  travis molly i want you to get right on the edge of the hole and keep an eye down the shaft  matt chirping like jester go fuck yourself  laura oh i love her  sam we woke her up though but it was cute  laura kiri shushing 
none	  liam am i able to prepare magic missile like a held spell for a fish head popping out of the hole  matt holding your action if it comes back around the spell is either fizzled or released  so you can wait for something and then cast the spell as an action  liam but i’d lose the slot if i held the  matt if you ended up holding it for a few minutes yes because the idea is that youre casting the  spell and then holding onto that last piece of the incantation  liam 
none	 i wont do that then but i will watch the hole  sam is our rope still dangling down the hole  matt no you pulled the rope up  laura im going to hold sacred flame because its a cantrip  taliesin im going to activate one sword hold it behind my back sit at the edge and wait to give  a swing see if anything is going to pop up  travis let it come all the way up if it does  sam if it comes up should we grab it  travis grapple it fall 
none	 flat kill it quietly  matt you guys take a moment in silence  laura it might be going back and telling its friends though and they’re all going to come back  marisha you think those guys have strong family bonds  laura probably  matt two minutes pass three minutes pass  laura oh no what if it digs up a hole in another area you guys  matt then you hear this eversofaint grinding of root on scale this merrow sentinel slides  slithering like a snake out of the curtain of roots that currently cover that 
none	 one portion of the  wall that leads further beneath the safe house all of you guys take a surprise round as soon as  it emerges to go ahead and inspect its like huh  travis it came up the tunnel that was already there  matt yeah it emerged and jackintheboxed out towards you  laura dex save of 15  matt that is a four nope  laura ten radiant damage  matt ten radiant damage good to know  sam i fired and missed with a natural one  matt oh buddy whoosh nothing  taliesin 
none	 just a standard attack or standard and bonus  matt for the purpose of it all happening at once just one attack  taliesin two strikes or one strike  matt two strikes its whatever your attack action is  taliesin thats awful 11  matt misses  taliesin and an eight  matt both miss unfortunately because you guys dont have any light in here when it emerges  youre all swinging in the darkness hoping to hit it in the direction of where it is  liam i have no lights up so i should be at disadvantage 
none	 right  matt you would be yes  liam im going to roll again what does that say  matt is this magic missile  liam no i had to fire bolt so it wouldnt matter how long i held it my lower is a 12  matt that misses  marisha i rolled a 20 total thats 11 damage my second attack missed  matt all right  travis i did eldritch blast and a 20 and a 24  matt both hit roll damage  travis ten and a nine 19 points of eldritch blast  matt all 
none	 righty  ashley i rolled a ten total  matt on your first attack  ashley second attack there we go thats a 21  taliesin someone hit something yay  laura you should really separate out your dice ashley  ashley i know its making you crazy  travis monstrous or  matt they are considered monstrosities so consider that for any damage you deal to them with  your sword  travis i will  matt youre not raging so you dont have the plus two nor do you have your  ashley path of divine  matt 
none	 correct because youre not raging  ashley its ten  matt thats enough even with all of your misses you watch as it emerges and then multiple impacts  and slumps yeah as you grab it it starts sliding back into the tunnel you grab and  lift him hes heavy as shit and you all together manage to slip it into and onto the floor  liam i just watched all that  taliesin im staying on guard in case anything else comes through  matt fair enough  travis yeah same  matt what little bit of light 
none	 you have in the chamber right now is a little faint radiant glow  from the sword that molly currently has that is like candlelight if anything  liam im going to pull out a rag and do my veiled lantern thing with dancing lights  laura you should probably put another one of those things up caleb  liam put one of what things up  laura another alarm  liam down there you want me to go down there  ashley do you want me to go with you  travis yeah you and yasha go  ashley 
none	 okay lets go  sam and laura no  liam im going to send frumpkin down again  matt frumpkin emerges you send frumpkin back down make a stealth check for frumpkin  liam come on frumpy nine  travis nein  matt the loudest cat youve ever heard frumpkin is the neighborhood cat in heat at this point he  makes his way down through the tunnel make a perception check with disadvantage for frumpkin  because he’s now coming around the edge  liam someone told me that cats have advantage on perception are they full of shit 
none	 you’re my dm  would it cancel out is why im asking  matt would it cancel out i would ask you to keep the stats of your cat on you for future reference  liam i will  matt they have advantage on wisdom perception checks that rely on smell id say sure  liam so cancel  matt yeah itll cancel out so a straight roll  laura and its a fish cats are really perceptive when it comes to fish  liam thats pretty good perception 19  matt okay frumpkin heads on down keeps an eye 
none	 out on that space does a little pass no sign of  any other emerging or present merrow  taliesin instead of putting another wire down there you could leave frumpkin down there and he  can alert us if theres any problem  travis but hes got to stay awake for it  liam he could watch but the alarm is just as good its automatic gets me up frumpkin can  sleep after you  sam youre going down there  liam ja  sam by yourselves  laura with yasha  ashley with me  sam take 
none	 good care of him  ashley i will  taliesin if we hear anything were going to charge down there theyll be fine  sam he cant make it without you  ashley i know  sam he will not come back alive  ashley i know i will take care of him as best as i can even better than that i will take care of  him i promise you he will not die  sam he will have no chance of survival okay  matt slowly lowering the rope back down the tunnel which one of you 
none	 is taking point on  climbing down  ashley i will go first  matt you make your way down the rope aiding you in the process you get to the bottom you as  well id like you both to roll stealth checks please as you emerge in the lower cavern  liam 12  ashley 13  matt you two gingerly step your way around the edge back to the site you can see of the three  corpses of the merrow there in the center of the opposite side of the cavern  liam i have my 
dung	 hand on yashas enormous rippling shoulder  matt as you make your way around to the other pool you can see the water disturbed relatively  recently isnt perfectly still but its nearing there its coming to rest no sign of anything  down there  ashley okay do your shit  liam i need about ten minutes in the dark i pull out the thread and i start doing the thing  ashley make it a little faster than ten if you can  liam i cant do that but i will do that  matt five minutes go 
none	 by  sam im going to cast message are you still alive you can reply to this message  taliesin mention that they should clean up the bodies  sam oh yeah while yashas waiting she can clean up the bodies you can reply to this message  ashley i will start to move the bodies  laura and ashley stealthily  liam well say that i said that out loud to her  ashley yes what did you say  liam nott had a wonderful idea for you to pick up all of the dead things  matt yasha 
none	 you begin to drag the bodies back into the central pool they sink  ashley flow in  matt all right you complete the latter half of it okay you finish the spell you sense the arcane  unseen net of the alarm click in and its prepared and set to keep watch  liam lets get the shit out of here  laura whispering run away  ashley lets go  matt you guys make your way back climb back up the rope and make your way into the interior of  the tree seemingly without incident  ashley 
none	 seemingly  laura im going back to sleep you guys i need to get my spells back  ashley ill take the next watch since im awake  matt yasha takes final watch go ahead and roll a perception check for me  liam im freaked out so im going to stay up with yasha  matt both of you guys make perception checks for me please  liam perception 11  sam singing run away run away  ashley 15  matt as you guys complete the third watch for the evening you sense the morning come as the 
none	  temperature which previously had gotten quite chilled is beginning to rise a bit though now  you can still see your breath in the air a faint bit of bluish light begins to appear at the outer  edges of the driftwood piece that is wedged in the doorway to make it look flush with the rest of the  exterior bark you all complete a long rest you have your abilities back your hit points full  and you are ready to continue  liam could i back up one hour and ask yasha a quick question  
none	 matt sure  liam this is a small group for you you traveled with the circus  ashley yeah  liam this is a big group for me  ashley it is  liam do you have any advice  ashley well i mean  liam you seem awkward like me  ashley yeah  liam but you made it work with a lot of people  ashley well if someone has a conversation with me i will talk to them  liam ive tried that too and it goes horribly  ashley no i dont think it goes as 
none	 bad as you think  liam i think it goes pretty bad  ashley i mean yes sometimes i think its been pretty bad even for me sometimes watching you  but that doesnt mean theres always room for improvement  liam im confused did you have advice  ashley i dont think im good at giving advice but just talk to people if they talk to you and  be nice you know eat with your mouth closed wash your hands  liam i start writing these things down  travis oh my god  ashley wash your hair

none	 as a giant barn you are hard to miss  ashley yeah well i  liam do you know what i miss  ashley what  liam shaving  ashley i could shave you right now with my sword  travis quietly yes  ashley ive done it before i like to not have hair on my arms this is what i do i really think  that cleanliness and hygiene is very important  liam one thing that i have realized today is that i need to work on my interpersonal skills and  friendship making so try not 
none	 to cut up my face okay  ashley okay do you just want a trim is there a certain look you want  liam no leave my hair on my head but i have not had a cleanshaven face in a long time  ashley do you want it all gone or you just want  liam no you can take it all  ashley its easier to do that  liam you can crush a person but im not quite sure how dexterous you are so i dont want any  fancy tricks  ashley i wont im going

none	 moving  liam four globules of light rise up around you as you begin to shave  ashley 16  matt maybe its the tensile strength of her arm muscles but such a large instrument seems  unexpectedly delicate across the features of your face its not a complete shave there are areas  that get missed because its not a very fine implement but for the most part the stubble gets  closer to your face there are a few sections that are unevenly smooth but its an improvement from  where it was before its as good a 
none	 shave you can get with a greatsword manages to avoid nicking  any major arteries and as you complete your work youre proud of it the sweat on your brow caleb  has no idea of how it looks other than you reaching up and touching your chin as it finishes  the rest of you come to consciousness  laura are you killing caleb  ashley no i was giving him a shave  laura oh whoa  marisha wow  sam its much better  laura you have a little thing you have a little dimple on your

none	 ed wynn getting tickled  matt its true  taliesin oh my  matt pass without a trace whats the range on that  laura 30 feet so it’s not going to to be for a very long time but  travis what do you mean  laura well it’s only 30 feet in front of around me  matt so you may want to go next  laura youll go away huh  matt you may want to go next then if you want that to affect other people  laura yeah  travis dont worry about me im 
none	 just swimming over there and coming back and then we can cast it  matt okay  travis its a guideline  matt you for the moment wade into it and burbling you guys watch as fjord once again  disappears beneath the surface of the water now with the confidence of knowing that there is a  breaking point and air ahead that fear doesnt creep up into your brain and you rush for it  making your way through make an athletics check  travis 12  matt 12 okay you manage to find it through and then 
none	 come up quietly just  travis apocalypse now  matt yeah apocalypse now andor the descent you slowly emerge from the water  laura ugh the descent now it makes me want to swim through that little tunnel even less  matt yeah  marisha so descenty you guys  matt glancing up your range of darkvision is 30 feet or 60 feet  travis 60 feet  matt 60 feet okay  travis where is that class features  matt racial features it should say  travis racial traits darkvision 60 feet  matt 60 feet great that gives 
none	 you enough perspective for now as you come up and look you  can see this chamber and you got a brief glance at it before most of it is natural rock but  there are elements of it that look like it was once an old bit of mason architecture you can see  edges where there are actual stones stacked and placed walls that have seemingly been partially  reclaimed through the ages you can see two large central pillars where stalagmite and stalactite  met eventually and created a structure in the center a large portion of 
none	 the floor is submerged  in water and you see different paths and avenues of it that curve off and vanish probably openings  to other tunnels beneath the pool youre in right there looking up you can see theres that weird  set of natural stairs that step up in front you can see four of these merrow creatures two of  which are in a conversation off to the left two that are currently rummaging through what looks to  be piles of things that have been pulled up and placed toward the top of the stair you 
none	 can hear the  clinking of metal and things falling and tumbling down the stairs you see a fifth figure thats at  the outskirts of your visual range thats currently faced away and looking at whatevers on  the other side of that upward pillar but nobody else seems to have noticed you emerging at this  point you havent made any shifting or movement  travis do they have an eyeline on me if they were to look over this way could they see my head  above the water  matt its possible if they were looking 
none	 carefully for you you dont know how far their darkvision  extends  travis can i wade forward and look for any stones or pillars that i might be able to throw the rope  around and tie a knot on  matt looking around you can see there are small mounds of various minerals that have long dripped  from the ceiling from condensation and various water flows that have come through this interior  cavern and built this hard rocky platform thats emerging just outside of where the pool ends so  you can bring the rope around 
none	 and affix it to that make a stealth check as you do so please  travis thats a two  sam pass without a trace  laura well no he didnt take it more than 30 feet away from me right hes more than 30 feet  away from me  matt he is yes  laura i should have given him blessing of the trickster oh no  travis yep thats amazing  matt thats a natural one you lucky son of a bitch through whatever grace your patron has  granted upon you  travis im in the 
none	 water man  matt the merrow are too distracted with whatever they are in the process of doing to notice you  slip and hit an elbow send a pebble falling you get low and finish tying it off they dont notice  travis okay great ill give it a gentle tug does it seem like the structure moves at all  matt no it seems pretty solid  travis ill take a deep breath and ill use it to pull myself chest up towards the surface  matt easy enough so after a few moments fjord emerges back where 
none	 you guys are waiting  laura hey you made it  travis yeah still five of them i tied it off everybody should be able to pull their way across  no problem but we got to be ready to rock when we get in there theyre a little distracted  marisha are we going to try and wait in the water and ambush as we go  travis yeah  marisha okay  travis or distract away from us and then go  marisha okay  travis or if we want we could cause a commotion and have them 
none	 come through the water at us and use  the hole as a funnel  marisha as a funnel might not be a bad idea  travis thoughts  laura that might be smarter and then you could fight with us nott for a while at least  sam i mean i dont like fighting but sure  laura youre so good at it nott  ashley someone’s going to have to go make a distraction and then make it back  marisha and i bet those things are pretty good swimmers  taliesin super fast in the water i 
none	 bet theyre really fast in the water  sam we could tie the rope oh we cant tie the rope to you because now its tied on the other side  travis im a very fast swimmer  marisha but faster than fish  travis i think its 60 feet actually is my swimming speed with this damn mariner’s armor  ignore what i said  laura your regular swimming speed  travis regular speed yeah  laughter  matt your swim speed is half your movement  travis well then yeah it’s 30 feet  matt 15 feet  
none	 travis well with it it’s my normal walking speed  matt oh right with that it is yes  sam so youre a fast swimmer  laura so yeah thats pretty good  taliesin but probably not as fast as they are  travis nah could i guesstimate how far it was from entrance to portal where the rope is  matt from where you are to the make a survival check  travis 13  matt 13 best you could estimate its close to 40 or so feet  liam how long has he been gone for  travis 
none	 im back  matt hes back  liam oh youre in here talking about what was there  laura what if we just made a lot of noise in here  taliesin im of the opinion that the problem with this bottleneck is we dont know what they are  doing on the other side it would be easier to assess whats coming and make sure that they  cant if we take care of everything there then we can assess whats there and they cant prepare  or get more together have time to  travis so you want 
none	 to head over there  taliesin i feel like over there is the way to go  travis okay i see the validity in that argument  laura ill get in the water  travis pass without a trace first  laura well yeah  travis okay  taliesin well stay together in a group  laura how long did you have to hold your breath for fjord  travis i dont know about 45 50 seconds  laura easy peasy lemon squeezy pass without a trace  matt coming back on the rope its a lot easier your first 
none	 dive down took a while to feel your way through  liam i was distracted i was thinking about my books i dont want them to get harmed your bag  is probably water resistant yeah  laura i dont know but we can try it give me your books caleb give me the books  ashley do you want to leave them with nott  liam i do want to leave them with nott im going to unharness the  sam can you still cast spells  liam yeah  sam oh okay  taliesin ill leave my coat

none	 laura lasts for an hour though so it’s okay  matt kiri leans into you this means we are friends  laura she heard  matt she woke up early  sam sounds like caleb wow  ashley wait that was okay  marisha shes going to rattle off some secrets  travis kiris got to die thousands of artists are like gasping  laura whos first are you going back through first  travis yeah ill go first  laura okay ill go second people should follow quickly behind me because you’ve got to stay  within 30 feet 
none	 of me  taliesin one quick attack or do we try and take them out quietly i assume well well take a  look at what it is  travis distract and attack  laura so were doing the distract but then they know somebodys there if we just come out of the  water and attack we get a sneak attack  travis if they dont see us  taliesin if they dont see us then we get the sneak attack and if they do  laura just go for it  taliesin well see what we see  
dung	 travis as i go in the water im going to go about halfway and then stop and tread and make sure that  everybody gets along the rope fine  matt okay all right youre casting pass without a trace first all right you finish casting the  spell the shadows already super dark in here with almost no light source beyond what calebs  providing they coalesce around you and the rest of the members of the team as you all dive into  the pool of water its black  laura caleb blessing of the trickster on the 
none	 way through  matt to caleb okay blessing of the trickster on you thats advantage on your stealth checks  i need everybody including fjord to roll a stealth check please plus ten to your stealth score  marisha natural 20  matt they rolled really high  taliesin 16  travis thank god for that pass without a trace 19  marisha 37  sam jesus  liam yeah girl yeah  matt thats some vax numbers right there  liam zweiundzwanzig 22  laura oh 16 oh no 18  taliesin and ashley 16  liam yeah thats

none	 the cube  liam 40foot cube excuse me sorry thats probably not big enough thats too big right  its too far  marisha 40 feets huge  matt wait you mean from you  liam if i were to hit the fish guy at the top and make that the corner of a cube and go this way it  would probably only get two of them right  matt possibly  liam forget it im going to cast haste on mollymauk  laura would i have had enough movement to get behind the big poo pile  matt 
dung	 you would  liam i cant see its dark im blind its the safer bet to aid my friend on the next turn  matt for you molly thats to signify your haste keep that in mind  liam you have just been hasted and i am going to move along the wall this way away from the enemies  that i think i can detect  matt youre still in the water thrashing trying to make your way to the edge molly youre up  but you lose this round because you were not part of the surprise you 
none	 were lagging a little behind  as yasha best way i can do this quickly because theyre losing their turn as well that brings us  to nott isnt even paying attention fjord  travis yep ill make my way towards the two on the left side as far as my  matt on the edge there  travis yeah oh damn thats as far as i can get huh  matt no you can go into the water if you want to go further you want to get up to him  travis yeah melee range  matt you 
none	 can get melee range youre in the water and youre swimming in the water but  because of your armor it doesnt reduce your attacks so youre not taking disadvantage on your  attack rolls  travis nice i will use booming blade in a melee strike with the wastehunter falchion against that  fishy fuck  matt fjord take your one attack  travis 14  matt 14 hits  travis it does oh my god thank you 1d8 because i didnt say twohanded thats 12 points  of damage plus because its a monstrosity  matt it is 
none	  travis 12 points of damage plus four that is a four 18 points of damage  matt 18 points of damage on that guy  travis with booming blade  matt if he moves at all on his next turn he takes an additional 2d8 good to know  travis yes sir with my bonus action i will hex this guy over here  matt this guy there  travis yes sir  matt hes been hexed does that finish your turn  travis yes it does  matt as you pull back the energy sparks around and theres 
none	 this weird movement in the water like  its thrashing the booming energy keeping that one merrow locked in place as the other one the  hex coalesces around its chest and holds it  travis ill give him disadvantage on wisdom  matt wisdom checks got it that ends top of the round now yasha you can take your turn the  ambush round is over  ashley im going to mosey on up over next to beau and i would like to rage  travis yeah  liam and ashley air horn blaring  liam from the cavern

none	 lower in the water to make itself harder to hit  what are you going to do you have a second attack right  ashley yeah i have a second attack  matt go for it  ashley thats not going to hit eight  matt eight misses unfortunately next one swings and a miss now the merrow all go  together because you guys left a big old gap of initiative there  laura oh no  travis its after yasha right  matt correct first part im going to say lets make it fun  sam yes lets 
none	  matt this guy here is going to take his trident and chuck it right towards beau  travis are these free tridents or do they also have that cord thats attached to them  marisha like the harpoons  matt they have the cords still attached thats a 17 to hit  marisha 17 is my armor class  matt there you go with that to there first off beau as it strikes you in the chest you take ten  points of piercing damage and i need you to make a strength check for me please  marisha 
none	 so good at this just a straight check or a saving throw  matt a strength check  marisha 19 sorry ten it looked like a 19 upside down  matt it was a 14 you get pulled through right next to it there in the middle of the water as  you fall to the ground its going to attempt to bite at you since youre in the water outside of  your terrain i will give it advantage on the strike because youre now thrashing water and  swimming and its in its own terrain thatll be 18 
none	 to hit with the bite on you there you take an  additional eight points of piercing damage at that moment this one here is going to turn around  onto fjord and is going to shift this way and unleash both bite and claw attack against you  fjord 17 to hit  travis that hits its my armor class  matt for that claw attack its going to be 2d4 seven points of piercing damage against you fjord  travis okay  sam did you guys scan the area for despacito beasts  travis seven points of damage 
none	  matt its going to pull back after it finishes clawing into you its going to try and bite down  with its jaws thats a 19 to hit  travis that hits  matt you take another seven points of piercing damage the one behind there who sees its friend  digging into fjords torso and body watches as it finishes its round of strikes and then  underhanded throws its harpoon towards him thats another 18 to hit  travis that hits  matt with that you take ten points of piercing damage i need you to make 
none	 a strength check as it  pierces you grab it and it manages to careen into the side of your hip and it hits bone you  feel it grind against the inside with the pain  travis thats a 17  matt you beat it rolled a 15 so you do not get pulled it does not give him his followup attack  however hes going to move forward to get his followup attack anyway with the rest of his  movement and is going to attempt to bite you and is going to miss thats a nine  
none	 travis nein  matt he goes to bite and as you pull the harpoon out and turn back your shield you bash the side  of its face and it manages to pull back it scrapes across its fishlike face but no impact or  damage all right thats going to finish his go the one that is right next to you yasha is going  to shift around not leaving combat with you but going behind the pillar to give itself some cover  from anybody whos out in the vicinity its going to attempt to make two strikes 
none	 against you  travis i didnt i need to make hex checks  matt yes you do  travis oh shit how many of them three  matt three  sam ooh  travis at advantage because war caster right  matt yep  travis okay  matt roll higher than a ten  travis what is that constitution  matt constitution saving throw  travis okay thats a 15 did 15 work  matt 15 works  travis nice higher than a ten sorry thats a natural 19 thatll do it and 13 thats an 18  all three 
none	 save  matt all righty thats good on your end for you yasha you didnt use reckless last turn right  ashley no  matt thats a natural 20 on that first strike with the claws at you that is going to be 14  points of piercing damage reduced to half so you only take seven because youre raging and the  bite attack against you is a natural two plus six no that misses you with an eight however that  finishes their round and this guy up here who now spins around and sees the rest of 
none	 you come inside  begins shouting out in a language you dont understand snarling as its holding up this  staff that has this almost crystal spike of natural crystal at the end of it it begins to  chant something under its breath and as it spins its hand in the air you watch as the ceiling  above you in this chamber begins to grow into this low cloud that spirals out encompassing the  entirety of the interior of the chamber  laura run away  matt you see little sparks of lightning arcing through the cloud 
none	 as it spools above  marisha motherfucking druid fish  matt beau i need you to make a dexterity saving throw since youre the one closest to it  marisha saving throw  matt correct  marisha thats a natural one  matt you suffer 16 points of lightning damage as you get struck by lightning in the water which  you watch as technically now yeah if any of you are in the water when the lightning hits you you  have disadvantage on your saving throw because you are in the water didnt matter this time because  
none	 you failed anyway but you watch as the bolt strikes beau and she starts thrashing in the water  as the muscles tense theres a giant burn mark on the side of your head  travis oh shit you guys oh fuck  matt looking pretty rough on that one  marisha i just got fucked up  matt and its going to go ahead and spin itself over to the edge this way using the one below  getting itself between the rest of its merrow compatriots and you guys that finishes their  turn beau youre up  
none	 marisha ah okay im going to take the one whos got a trident jabbed into my shoulder im going  to grab the chain and im going to yank it towards me as i deck him in the face twice  matt go for it  marisha the first attack  matt if you want to move around to get onto land otherwise youre going to be having a hard time in  the water here attacking them because youre constantly swimming  marisha can i do that  matt you still have movement yeah so you can move five 
none	 ten 15 20 25 there so you manage to  whip around get out up onto land and not end up with a disadvantage on your attacks  marisha okay the first one is 15  matt 15 does hit yes  marisha woohoo okay second attack not as good 12  matt 12 does not hit unfortunately but the first strike as you pull up cracks it right in  the jaw the next one it manages to bash your arm out of the way and it deflects off the side no impact  marisha okay thats seven damage 
none	  matt all righty the first strike  marisha and then i am going to take my bonus and spend a ki point to do patient defense  matt okay so as you get up on land you focus and looking around sidetoside make sure that  youre aware of everything around you and get ready to defend and deflect  marisha a little in shock pants ah  matt okay that finishes beaus turn jester youre up  laura okay im going to use spiritual weapon that i have up and try to hit that thing  matt go 
none	 ahead and roll the attack for that guy  laura ooh that hits thats a good one  matt okay all right what was the number  laura 15 plus my attack  matt 15 is its armor class so yeah thats fine well 13 actually so that definitely hits  laura and then 2d8 seven points of force damage to him  matt seven points plus your wisdom modifier  laura oh plus four so 11  matt there you go 11 points of damage to him all right how do you want to do this  cheering  
none	 laura oh man that feels good i havent got that in a long time im going to use the giant  lollipop and its going to raise really high up on the roof and then slam down onto it as hard as it can  matt yasha as youre engaged with it both growling at each other you watch as suddenly its  body crumples into the stonework  ashley i scream out yeah jester  matt it slips into the water and vanishes beneath the waves  ashley i flip it off  matt so thats your bonus action 
none	 you still have your movement and action  laura im also going to move it closer to the one next to beau  matt right there  laura yeah  matt all righty  laura and then im going to cast cure wounds at should i do that or should i do toll the dead on him  matt cure wounds is touch so you have to be right next to him  laura just kidding im going to toll the dead on the one that beaus fighting  matt okay whats the range on that  laura okay hold

none	 of the round yasha youre up  ashley okay  matt fjord vanished you see two now turning their eyes towards mollymauk whos right there  theres one across the way thats currently barrelling on beau and theres the one at the top  of the stairs right now that looks like its commanding a giant storm  ashley im going to go over to the one by beau  matt over here  ashley yeah  matt so thats five ten 15 20 25 35 youre in the water swimming so your attacks are at  disadvantage right now 
none	  ashley okay all right  matt if you wanted to do reckless you could counteract that but youll be taking  ashley well i had one natural 20 and then 18 was my lowest  matt wait so that was disadvantage  taliesin she rolled a natural 20 for her other roll  matt got you so the first attack was what  ashley 12 plus six  matt that hits so your first attack hits go ahead and roll damage on that  ashley okay same as last time 19 points of damage  matt 19 points of 
none	 damage nice all right and you have your second attack with disadvantage  ashley 15  matt 15 hits go ahead and roll damage on that  taliesin murder it  ashley 15 points of damage  matt this is you only do five additional damage on this one right so 15  ashley yeah  matt damn nice roll as you in the water cleave out once with the blade in this giant  splash arc of water from the middle of the pool in the center it carves across the side of its back  snarling it turns 
none	 around towards you right as you bring the second strike up into its abdomen  it pushes off the blade and it looks pretty hurt its bleeding out of its wounds in the middle of  its stomach and its back that finishes your turn  ashley do i have a no never mind thats not a bonus action never mind sorry was going to try  healing hands  matt that ends your turn its their turn so i will need you first off to make a dexterity  saving throw as you come up and carve into the 
none	 back of it the one on top hisses and directs its  finger down towards you as a bolt of lightning arcs out of the  ashley ten  taliesin wait no its a saving throw right  matt yeah saving throw plus  taliesin oh its a dex saving throw never mind sorry  matt that does not succeed youre in the water so it would be disadvantage anyway  taliesin that makes me sad  matt that is 25 points of lightning damage which is not halved on you because the rage doesnt  affect it it only 
none	 affects slashing piercing and bludgeoning so youre blasted in the middle of  the water you sink for a moment as your muscles give out your sword almost falls out of your grasp  and you manage to right yourself as youre treading water here your feet cant touch the  bottom of this pool and your eyes go flashing white for a second and for an instant you see  the face of kord the stormlord there from the vision your recently had then clarify and shake  it out of your head and carry yourself back into place 
none	 thats going to finish this guy whos going  to move around he can only move ten feet so he goes five ten hes going to stop right there  sam she got shocked so hard we saw parts of her dream  laughter  matt this guy right here is going to go ahead towards you beau as youre right there he has  disadvantage on the attacks against you though he’s going to go ahead and make its claw attack  against you with disadvantage thats cocked you saved yourself from a natural 20 with that one  
none	 its a 16 which i believe misses right  marisha misses just misses  matt so as it claws toward you you being prepared for it dart off to the side its going  to go ahead and take a bite at you  marisha you have such big hands  matt with disadvantage another natural 20 averted however that does come to a 19 so i  believe that does hit you  marisha ah  travis whoosh worcestershire sauce  matt that is 11 points of piercing damage as it bites down onto the front of your clavicle 
none	 and face  marisha im unconscious again  matt beau falls to the ground as she sinks from its jaw under the rock there it spins around  towards you right in your face its gills flaring up thats going to end its turn the two over  here this ones going to move there and theyre both going to flank molly they are both going to  harpoon you jam melee at the one on this side first attack is going to be an 18 to hit  taliesin that hits  matt whats your armor class  taliesin 
none	 17  matt plus two because of the haste  taliesin that is with the plus two im an ac of 15 i am easy target  matt oh buddy that does hit you so the first harpoon strike against you thats eight plus  four 12 points of piercing damage it jams you into the abdomen from that side the other strike  taliesin the other person im casting curse of the eyeless on the second  matt this guys finishing his round hes attempting to bite you thats going to be a 15  taliesin that does not 
none	 hit  matt as he bites down towards you this time as you pull the trident out you jam it up and it  throws him off and clips him in the side of the chin breaking off one of his teeth at that  moment the guy behind you is going to swing in with his harpoon as well  taliesin curse of the eyeless  matt okay reaction to that  taliesin and i take my three points of damage  matt thats cocked so he has a regular strike on this one so the attack with the 
dung	 harpoon is going  to be a 21 to hit unfortunately  taliesin with disadvantage  matt well he had advantage because he had you flanked so it just made it a general roll  taliesin okay that hits  matt so that is going to be ten points of piercing damage as the other harpoon jams you in  the back as youre arcing upward its going to attempt to bite down at you but its eyes have  gone dark and its just biting wild in front using the thrashing of your body to guide itself  that 
none	 is going to be a natural seven plus six 13 misses so it bites down you manage to duck out  of the way and slam the hilt of your scimitar up into its face and knock it off to the side thats  going to end their go that brings us to beau i need you to make a death saving throw please  sam were you saying the curse of the islands  taliesin the eyeless  marisha lets go cobalt blue 17  matt thats one success mark it on your tattoo jester youre up  laura

none	 this one has higher armor than the rest as you release both bolts its flailing around hurt  after taking the impact from the bolts you can see the burst of flame on its back from the shot it  took from nott and as it lurches forward it manages to arc out of the way of your bolt no  impact  travis oh roll to see  matt roll to see if you stick around  travis i disappear bamfing noise  marisha oh god youre cutting out fjord i cant  travis you guys are doing good 
none	 bamfing noise  taliesin take ten feet to the right i cant  matt lag spikes are rough when youre on a raid guys  liam this is like those tatasciore spells like mimics cutting out  matt top of the round yasha youre up  ashley im going to go around to can i flank him behind or somewheres  liam front of molly  matt right now no the space right there where technically it is ill say you can get up on  there sure using all your movement you can get on there its a little 
none	 wobbly  ashley then you know attack  matt no hold on beau was in the water this technically is not a space you can get on you  would not be able to flank with it you can get there if you want to because this is in the space  ashley its not considered flanking  matt no because you have to be on the exact opposite that space is currently occupied by the  stalagmite  ashley thats fine okay  matt youre in the water so disadvantage on your attacks  ashley disadvantage okay  laura 
dung	 i didnt even realize i was sitting here like  ashley 18  matt 18 hits  marisha its like this little dark cloud right over you  travis come on yasha  laura kill it yasha  ashley im going to try  liam thats what you do  ashley nine  liam yasha  travis nein  ashley 12 for the first hit  matt nice  liam come on buddy  ashley okay 20  matt 20 hits roll damage for your second strike  ashley 12  matt 12 points of damage it is so close 
dung	 it is hurt so bad as you slash twice in the water you  see these large arcs of stale stagnant cave water splashing in the air with this gleaming blade as  yashas tearing into it the pool around it is turning dark purple as its blood is seeping in and  its looking desperately around for some means of escape that end your turn yasha  ashley yeah i dont think i cant do anything else  matt its now the shallow priests turn  laura oh no thunderwave  sam oh no youre all grouped together  
none	 matt yeah thats what its going to do level two thunderwave  liam would caleb have flown backwards when he was struck before  matt hmm  liam when caleb was knocked down by thunderwave the first time would he have been thrown  backwards  matt it would have thrown you back into the wall theres nowhere more for you to push this way  liam oh i thought  sam oh no is he within the cube  taliesin well it depends where the cube goes  marisha yeah its a direction its not a cube around you 
none	 its a you have to shoot it  travis its shallow priest discretion what will he do look as the dm muddles his choices  considers consequences plans his retribution  sam decides to kill liam forever  taliesin if he wants to escape hes got to knock us all back  travis as his hair dangles beautifully in front of his face thinks singing im in another  dimension  marisha doing the charleston  matt the placement here makes it a little hairy its going to go ahead and  sam thats only three squares right  matt 
none	 its a fifteenfoot cube in front of you and its trying to yeah you guys are positioned  in such a way where it  sam it doesnt have to be in front of you  it says in any direction  matt well yeah but you cant be part of a cube and im trying to figure out what would be the  most optimal way for it to use it im going to say  taliesin its going to be the two of us i think yeah thats my money  matt no the ones who are hurt 
none	 the most are beau and yasha and theyve been the biggest problem for  these guys its not too worried about the other two 15foot cube okay all right you know what  its going to go ahead and attempt to shift this way one square into the space with the spiritual  weapon  taliesin so it gets an attack of opportunity from  matt from yasha  laura and from jester  matt and from jester both of you guys make an attack with disadvantage for you yasha its  risky on its endeavor but its whats going 
none	 to give it an opportunity to try and get out of this  lockdown  ashley it hits  matt whatd you roll  ashley i rolled a 16 and a 21  matt okay 16 hits  ashley thats just a regular attack  matt yeah regular attack  laura i rolled a 15  matt 15 just hits  travis so if you hit with your sentinel does that mean its speed is reduced to zero  matt yep it cant move so with sentinel it does not get a chance to move as you arc towards  
none	 it how much damage did you do  ashley nine  matt nine  laura five  matt five how do you two want to do this  cheering  laura i go low you go high  ashley yeah  laura all right i go low with the handaxe  matt okay so as you swing with the handaxe and you swing with the sword as it backs away  charging the energy of the thunderwave in its hands it tries to slink through the water the  blade of your handaxe carves into its throat from this side 
none	 painful grunt at which point the  blade hits from this side slurp and like a terrible scene out of rikioh because i have not  used that reference in this campaign the body gets split in two sides and you watch as it falls  to the ground in three separate pieces thuds all sinking beneath the water below  ashley see ya  travis wouldnt want to be ya  ashley oh my god can we grab some of the stuff before he goes into the water  sam youre looting him before he  ashley yeah before 
none	 he sinks down  liam should i make another death save  matt yes you do caleb thats cocked  liam thats an 11  matt okay  laura i go are we still in initiative order  matt right now at this point there is no threat  travis can i blink back in and go stop  matt yes you drop the spell  travis panting  laura im going to cure wounds caleb  matt okay go ahead and heal up for that  laura im going to be so pissed off though about nothing working im 
none	 just going to touch him with  my toes  laughter  matt the last slab of its flesh that you had carved from its head and shoulder area you push  into the water kicking it forward  laura oh thats good 12 points of healing  matt so caleb you heal 12 hit points  liam thank you groans ow  sam not attractive  travis can i make my way over and up the steps  taliesin ill join you  matt well say as you guys gather to go ahead and deal with the aftermath of

tavern	  marisha caleb do you yeah all right  laura check for traps you guys  sam oh okay i can do that are there any boxes or treasure chests  matt you see remnants of crates and broken goods littered across the rough staircase now that you  take a moment to inspect it make an investigation check if you want to glance about the space  sam with disadvantage  matt yes because you are drunk  sam thats an eight  matt you find some broken pieces of pottery it seems like nice polished on one side 
none	 with a  nice glaze  sam ill take those  matt you can write down in your inventory broken pieces of shiny pottery fjord  travis can i pick up his big trident that has the cord attached to it is it wrapped around his  wrist or anything is that how he was pulling people  matt if you look at the trident it looks like its a very tightly woven rope but the individual  threads of rope are treated like a leathertype stat so its a really tight leather cord  travis is it attached to 
none	 his person in some way  matt from what you can see where it was dangling from there they’re wrapped in a loose loop around  the side of their armor and when they throw it they catch the end of it and pull it back  travis ill take the trident and unhook it from his armor  matt okay its about 60 feet of leather cord if you want to call it that sturdy leather cord  its heavy so its about twice the weight of hemp rope its stronger but its heavier  travis these guys were 
none	 big  matt yeah theyre pretty strong  marisha can i take a short rest while everyones doing this  matt if you guys want to take a short rest if you guys are inspecting the rest of the area  travis yeah yall look for shit im going to meditate for a hot second  sam if youre going to meditate maybe go back and check on the little bird  travis where did you leave her  sam i think shes okay i left her in an invisible i made a false rock  laura i go into 
none	 the water to look for her  matt jester as you come back into the next chamber youre looking around and theres no sign  of kiri you see natural stone the pool a piece of wall to the side and theres no sign  laura oh no shes been taken kiri kiri  matt like jester im kiri you look around and you dont see anything  laura kiri where are you are you invisible  matt like jester yes im very sweet  laura oh kiri im going to find you say warmer or colder and i start 
none	 walking around  the room warmer  matt like jester warmer you slowly start making your way towards this weird cylindrical  stone wall that you now realize wasnt there before  laura this is a weirdlooking wall  matt you reach through and your hand goes right into a tuft of feathers startled chirping  laura kiri  matt kiri reaches up and grabs your hand and you pull her through the illusion she steps out and  goes like cali i killed people  laura good for you i did too just barely it was a bad day 
none	 for me kiri  matt kiri points to one of the bodies of the merrow that you had killed the night before thats  barely visible out of the water there it looks like it has a couple stab wounds to it and kiris like  laura did you go stab a dead person  matt chirping  laura we should probably teach you thats not the coolest thing to do i dont think but its fine  that you did it this time im sure he didnt feel it but probably if were in a place where other  
none	 people are around we probably shouldnt stab people that are already hurt  matt like jester okay okay okay  laura i mean no thats a lie unless they are attacking you dont stab people that are  deaddead  matt like jester “okay okay okay”  laura okay okay okay  liam i realize something in a panic and i trudge through the water back towards the entrance and i  pull out the wire and i put it in my hands and i cast message and say to jester please please  please get my books and put 
none	 them in your bag please  laura okay  matt make an investigation check jester  laura watch me roll a fucking 20 on this  taliesin oh god no  laura oh god no that was cocked and i just moved it oh good that’s worse four  matt as you spend a moment searching around in the middle of the dirt with no luck theres a  little knock on your shoulder with a pointed finger you glance over and kiri has the book  bundle the leather strap  laura were you holding those the whole time 
none	  matt chirping points to the side corner  laura put those books in this pink bag okay all right  travis are there any stairways or doors or gates or anything that would lead upwards from  this cavern  matt if you want to start inspecting the area up the stairs theres a platform above where theres  more of the boxes and crates and theres piles of things gathered around some sort of rock  formation where that mist seems to be emanating from which is still loosely drifting off of the  surface of the water 
none	  travis yeah ill take a closer look  matt okay make an investigation check  travis 14  matt 14 okay you can see scattered bits of gold and silver and copper that have been lost amongst  the steps here some of them covered in dirt or mud and can be cleaned and pulled out of there as  you ascend the steps if anybody wants to join fjord as well you go with him as well you also  see theres a bunch of silverware thrown around very nice fine silverware that is in many cases  
none	 partially packed with more mud sand and whatever grime is here it looks like everything was  brought here and largely a number of it has been discarded or left with no particular purpose as  you begin to pore through some of it you see theres a crate thats partially open theres a  cache of weapons in there that are bound in clusters with leather straps around them looking  there there are four wellmade longswords four wellmade shortswords two battleaxes and two  halberds that are part of this cache theyre resting open on the inside of 
dung	 this open crate  theres a locked dark wood case about four feet across and a foot wide that is currently closed  and latched theres also a locked iron box thats flat a foot and a half by a foot and a half its  simple steel iron look to it then theres the stone formation thats about six to ten foot at  different places its a bit oblong and strange its not a perfect oval but its made to be this  pool of water where the mist is rising and sifting out of it around the 
none	 edges of it there  are dozens and dozens of metallic objects of different shapes and configurations and designs  make a religion check  travis natural 19 for 21  matt you recognize a majority of the iconography here it looks like one of these bundles one of  these boxes that was gathered here was filled with holy symbols and religious iconography most  of which appear to be deities that are outlawed by the empire you see symbols and worship idols for  the archeart you see some for avandra the changebringer you see a number of 
dung	 moonweaver holy  symbols with the two crescent moons across the silver cross you see the hook and the wreath of  the wildmother melora a number of those scattered about some in disrepair with actual  pieces of dried barley and other grains around it you see a number of symbols of kord the  stormlord you see a handful for the everlight there are a few more dubious symbols as well  theres one that looks like a dark horned crown that you recognize that is used to invoke  asmodeus the lord of the hells you see 
none	 one that looks like you only see a few of these but it  looks like a series of chains and shackles that are across a coffinlike box and you know that  because you rolled super high to represent bane the strife emperor who is a deity of conquest  sam lets hear it liam  liam bane voice your punishment will be more severe  matt there it is  marisha you were waiting for it  matt as well as the clawed hand on a number of items that resemble tiamat the scaled tyrant  travis you 
none	 guys come up here theres a ton of arms up here theres battleaxes and swords but  theres all these trinkets and holy symbols  liam are you being careful up there  travis careful  liam yeah you know nott could have a look around i could have a look around once jester  returns with my books  travis yeah i actually wouldnt mind if you check for magic and nott actually theres this  fourfoot long box if you want to try and open her up for me  matt jester you return did you take kiri 
none	 with you  laura ill have her hold on to my belt as we swim  sam is it locked  travis i think so it looks to be latched shut in some way  matt at this point you hear a distant sound that echoes through the wall fluttering you spin and  look over and you can see jester emerging from the water and a little black bird that is currently  fluttering to try to get the water off the feathers  liam i start speed wading back stuttering are my books dry  laura oh yeah 
none	 i put them in my coat dont worry theyre fine  liam but can i see them  laura yeah just kidding theyre in the bag dont worry  liam are they dry  matt theyre dry  liam theyre dry okay  matt nott what were you looking at  sam theres a locked box  travis the fourfoot long one  matt yeah theres two boxes  sam two boxes  travis the iron one and the wooden one  liam i recommend that you allow me to check for magical problems then once we know whats what 
none	  then you go in but that takes about ten minutes  sam okay yes sounds good to me  travis yeah sure were kind of in the middle of a short rest anyways  liam so i will pull out my spellbook and i will use ritual casting to cast detect magic  matt okay as you focus there is a as you look over there is a faint magical aura from inside  the pool where the mist is emanating and the long wooden box emanates a magical source from the  inside  taliesin is the staff 
none	 that the  matt youd have to try and retrieve the body it sunk into the water  taliesin we grabbed it before it sank  matt the staffed one okay as you pull the staff over the staff does not have any magical  properties it looked like it was just a focus for whatever spellcasting it was doing make an  investigation check as you were going back to the body  liam theres a glow in the water as well  matt if you want  liam well im not doing anything im just saying  matt 
none	 you feel a magical presence within the pool not the pool itself but within and the mist is  still pouring over the edges of it  ashley the pool thats up at the  matt yeah the upper platform  marisha i like having codenames  laura are you looking whos looking  sam ill try should i try to open the box  travis hes still doing his magic circle or whatever  liam we know that there is something magical in the pool itself and then you said the long wooden  box is glowing  matt 
none	 yes  liam what kind of magic is coming off of the wooden box  matt enchantment  liam enchantment  laura exaggerated cockney accent enchantment  matt exaggerated cockney accent enchantment hi yuri  taliesin ill take a look in there ill walk towards the pool at the very least im going to  pick up any of the moonweaver pieces  matt make an investigation check as you pore through and find as many as you want to  liam i dont believe that there is any kind of protection or magical lock on that so yeah try 
none	  to pick the lock from a distance  laura ooh what are all these things molly  taliesin im not entirely sure but theyre very very nice  matt are you glancing through as well  laura yeah i want to find something for the traveler  matt okay make an investigation check  travis is this on the priest the shallow priest  matt this is the pile of religious iconography  laura 11  matt 11 okay because  taliesin also 11  matt all right you find and theres a number of these you see probably 
none	 in total well over  100 to 120 various holy symbols idols small representations pressed into metal or clay these  are all means of worship from a grand scale to a pauper scale that seem to have been part of what  was moving through this smuggling path  laura im looking for the travelers symbol  matt which you find two  gasps  matt you who have never met anybody else who has ever met the traveler you look down and find  amongst this pile two holy symbols of different make one appears to be almost 
town	 pure silver one  looks like its a little more of a burnished bronze or a dull iron thats very very heavily  tarnished but they both have the same door arch with the road expanding from the center  laura whoa look  sam what is it what are they  laura oh i wasnt talking to you  sam oh okay  laura look  travis who are you talking to jester  laura the traveler lookit you have symbols here  taliesin it looks like a door  laura it is a door hes a traveler he 
none	 travels  taliesin his symbol is a door  laura yeah  travis do you feel the traveler in here  laura well if he is he was fucking with me earlier are you in here  matt no response  laura i dont think so  marisha do i see anything from ioun i hobble up crack my rib back in place  matt make an investigation check  marisha okay  travis its actually a little discomforting these symbols  taliesin i would say so  marisha you said investigation  matt yep  marisha ten  matt 
dung	 you give a solid glance through and it looks like no ioun the knowing mistress is one of  the approved religions and you get the sense that all the symbols that are here are religions that  are unapproved by the empire or considered betrayer gods and are not approved anywhere  taliesin what do i find for the moonweaver  matt oh plenty of moonweaver symbols theres probably a good 12 or 13  travis theres also some very dark deities here asmodeus  laura which ones are the bad ones  travis asmodeus  matt asmodeus  
tavern	 travis asmodeus bane the strife emperor tiamat  laura and matt singing asmodeus asmodeus  sam ill cast mage hand from afar and try to unlock the big box  matt go ahead and make your with disadvantage  sam oh an 18 and a 19  matt oh look at that even while drunk little notts able to  liam singsong dodedodedo  sam singsong whoopiedoopiedoopiedoopiedoop click  taliesin you did check for traps right  laura doesnt matter  sam no im opening it fuck off grandpa  taliesin im going to sit back and watch  liam 
none	 shes doing it from 30 feet away hopefully thats enough  matt the latch spins off and a blade fires out from where the lock was shoots across the room  and vanishes into the darkness before it scrapes off some stone in the distance  laura good job nott  taliesin again  matt it appears to be open theres a slight gap now where the lid is now open you lift it up  looking inside you see this beautiful jewelinlaid curved golden blade of some kind  with what little bit of light that you guys have 
none	 at your disposal now you can see it shining and its  this pure gold color as you swing it for a moment it seems to bend with the movement before  flicking back into place  laura it’s made of rubber  marisha it’s the rubber pencil trick  sam is it a super long blade or is it like a rapiertype thing  matt it would constitute in the vein of a scimitar  taliesin that looks very exciting im going to run over  sam no i dont think  taliesin yeah nope no im pushing aside 
none	 im going to try the weight  matt its pretty wellbalanced lighter than youd expect and gold is not a good metal for any sort  of combat its a soft metal and you see the flexibility seems such but yet itd probably hit  pretty hard but youre a little worried about using gold for any sort of combat scenario  laura maybe its ceremonial  taliesin perhaps  ashley swing it around  taliesin i give it a swing  matt swings pretty solid  ashley want to hit me with it  laura no wait let caleb 
none	 look at it what if its superduper cursed yasha  sam well melt it down and sell it for raw gold  taliesin its worth more as it is  liam that looks heavy so first you hold that have we found everything also while all that was  going on i was looking for a jagged cross with two crescent moons in it  matt yes and you managed to find it you find probably about 6 or 7 different variations to the  archearts iconography  marisha and taliesin archeart  liam of those 6 or 7 that 
none	 i saw i will take the one that looks the most familiar to me from my  memory  matt you find one thats pretty similar to the one that you saw  liam i’m going to keep that  matt you pocket it  ashley i rolled a 13  matt a 13 to  ashley to look for a symbol of the stormlord  matt you find about four of them two of them are medallions and one of them looks like a ceramic  marker that would be hung on a wall one of them looks like 
none	 it was part of a latch on a small chest  and was torn from it you see bits of rotted wood on the back of it where it may have been  previously pressed in and bolted against the outside of a chest  marisha can i look around on the walls and on the doors and using my criminal background see if i  see anything that’s thieves’ cant or smuggling operation things  matt sure make an investigation check  marisha 23  matt okay while you guys are having this conversation beau is casing the joint 
none	 here there  are no hidden exits in fact you get the sense that all the entrances and exits here are through  the various pools of water you begin to think based on placement that theres probably a  network of caverns here and possibly more merrow that exist in the vicinity of the lake of the  ounterloch beyond here  travis can you describe what the bane the strife emperor symbol looks like  matt yes actually i can show you an image of it  laura you know there are a lot of shackles around everywhere 
none	 right  travis here  taliesin in general  laura didnt we find like four manacles and there were four dead bodies too right in the  other room  marisha we keep finding dead skeletons  ashley and also steal 185 gold which we did not disburse  matt that is what you see its like an upsidedown coffinlike design with these chains  that cross over  travis its just this little handheld thing  matt yes its roughly a little larger than your palm  travis can i toss it into the well  matt sure it 
none	 sinks down and for a moment it obscures but you see this very faint yellowish  color on the bottom it disappears into the pool  laura why would you do that are you trying to bring about this really weird god can i reach  in and try to get it out  matt sure you reach in and you scour around and your hand touches and finds the symbol next to  it theres a polished stone about that big thats resting in the silt at the bottom  laura ooh i reach in and grab that  
none	 matt okay you pull out the stone and as soon as the water emerges from it its smooth it looks  like a cats eye it has a yellowish color to it and there are striations that refract light around  it at one end it looks like there was an impact carved a line about three inches across on one side  liam clearly thats whats glowing at the bottom to my eyes  matt it has a very faint yellowish glow  liam what kind of magic school of magic is it  matt its not a school 
none	 of arcane magic  laura what is this i still grab the other little symbol  matt okay symbol there  liam i dont know i think you should put it  laura want to look at it  liam yeah lets put it down with that sword that we found mollymauk  marisha does the groove in it look like it matches the size of the blade of the sword  matt she sets it down and rests it there next to the other symbol at an angle it doesnt look  like it matches the sword the groove 
none	 thats hewn into it what at first looked like it was impacted or  wounded by some sort of damage upon closer look it looks intentionally placed or carved in so you  have this cats eye yellowish sphere with this three inchwide pointed oval line in the front  laura looks like its an eyeball  marisha yeah  sam could be the end of a sending stone or something  travis did any of the shortswords longswords battleaxes any of those register under calebs  magic sweep or theyre just nicely made  matt theyre just wellmade like 
none	 freshly made and were being sent somewhere  sam should we take them all  liam do you want to see something  laura i hold it up in front of my face  sam ah youre a cyclops kill her  laura can i see through it  matt you cannot  liam come with me okay  laura all right  liam im going to lead jester up to the top where fish guy was at the beginning with his staff set  it down and  matt thats where you guys are standing right now  liam 
none	 we’re already up there  matt thats where youve removed from the pool  liam yeah i want to go up where all the little thingies are  matt yes  liam lets set it down just in case okay then i pull out my spell book again and will you hold  this for me  laura of course i will thank you very much  liam sit down with me i rifle through the pages to the right one for identify and the sword is  down okay im going to use this one you can see and 
none	 i start showing the different glyphs and  i start the ritual  matt fjord something about that orb is very familiar  sam hes teaching you magic listen carefully  laura i am  sam youll learn new spells this way  laura im listening  sam what did he just say  laura hes not talking right now  sam oh yes okay  laura hes muttering  liam so it takes ten minutes to make the spell  matt okay so while youre doing that  taliesin is there one more box we havent opened  matt 
tavern	 there is one more metal box thats not been opened  sam should i open it  taliesin you should check for traps and open it  sam all right ill finger it from afar  matt make an investigation check  laura are we far enough away from it  matt with disadvantage because you are drunk  sam its a one  matt okay seems fine  sam ill open it  taliesin in theory weve moved it aside  matt all right disadvantage to try and open the lock  sam what is this thieves tools  
none	 matt thieves tools so its dexterity plus your proficiency bonus  sam ill never figure this out dexterity plus  laura proficiency  sam i rolled a ten  laura so 17  matt 17 thatll do it you needed a 16 the iron box opens nothing goes off no blades no traps  on the inside you see a beautifully smithed sword handle and hilt made from silver with an  acornsized emerald set on each side of the hilt right in the center  taliesin oh lets put that in the pile  sam theres no blade  
none	 matt the blade extends for an inch before its broken off at a jagged angle  taliesin lets put that in the pile too  marisha an inch  matt theres an inch of the blade it seems to have broken off at some point  laura is it magic  liam i thought it was just the long box that we already opened  sam well this was a metal box  matt right you did not sense any magic from this  laura gasps can i use mending on it  liam if the box was solid enough 
none	 thats true  matt you attempt to cast mending on this  laura on the sword  matt strangely it resists it  travis oh put that shit in the pile  laura yeah okay  matt theres something about it even though it didnt emanate a magical essence from what he was  requesting the mending spell for some reason is unable to grasp the nature of this object to  complete it  liam i would think there would be enough time overlap though for detect magic to still have  one or two minutes left before we 
none	 get to the end of identify so if that is brought over do i  notice any sort of glow from  matt no magical essence from it but as youre looking over it beyond just the beautiful make of  it you do see runes carved across the hilt and at the pommel it looks like at one point it was an  enchanted blade but was sundered and is missing the rest  liam okay so i mutter i pause my chanting and say i will take a look at that in a moment hold  on and 
none	 finish my 11 minutes of ritual casting  travis im not going to interrupt but that sphere looks very  laura like an eyeball  travis yeah famili do you mind if i is it wet  liam wait is anyone going to interrupt me before i get to the end of identify  sam no lets wait in real time 11 minutes  liam yeah  laughter  taliesin roll initiative  marisha it doesnt look like the gash in the orb is deeper than the length of the blade thats left  correct  matt im sorry what 
none	 was that  liam just a bunch of sexual innuendo matt  ashley but what about the other sword  matt what was your question  marisha the god damn it  sam no he said before that it didnt look like the blade made the gash in the eye  marisha but this was a different blade  ashley that was a different blade though  marisha there are two blades  liam yes theres a complete blade thats magic  marisha but im just wondering if it fits never mind  matt oh fits the  marisha let 
none	 him finish the damn spell  travis if it fits the gash in the side of the sphere  marisha the sphere the broken hilt  matt no the carve in the sphere is about three inches long the blade looks like it wouldve been  about two inches wide and its broken off at a jagged side angle  liam caleb is furrowing his brow at everybody arguing about this as hes 30 seconds away from  ending  marisha stop concentrate concentrate  liam lost gone  marisha yeah ill help jester look around maybe we see a 
none	 broken blade somewhere while he finishes that  liam jesters holding my spell book  laura i know i pass it over to nott here im not learning anything  marisha jester and i do a quick scan to see if we can find the broken blade  matt okay investigation check either both of you roll or one of you roll with advantage up to you  laura take advantage  marisha do you see anything take advantage a nine and a ten its okay 15  matt 15 looking around you see no sign of any other half 
none	 of the blade broken or not  taliesin it was in a case so i suppose it would be unlikely or if it was on its way somewhere  it was probably on the way to the other end of it  laura i walk back over to caleb  matt okay anybody else okay  marisha what do you find out  matt so you finish casting identify on  liam on sword and cats eye its whatevers sitting in my little  matt all right the sword is not magical and so it does not give you any 
none	 essence as to what  enchantment it is looking at the runes you could see that there was once held magic  liam the complete sword  matt oh the finished one sorry i misunderstood that yes  liam all this shit doesnt exist so sometimes its hard to tell what were talking about  matt im sorry  laura it exists liam  matt that you do have immediate grasp of what it is capable of  liam this blade is called summers dance  marisha singing ooh i want to dance with somebody  marisha sam and laura 
none	 singing i want to feel the heat with somebody  liam mr mollymauk  taliesin mr caleb  liam i feel like this might be good for you there is a kind of magic that i do not even  possess that allows you to vanish from one point and reappear in another and this blade will allow  you to do it  taliesin maniacal laughter youre going to get yours oh yes  liam it is a very fine blade it is more lethal than a regular blade and will allow you to poof  poof poof  
none	 taliesin ill be living the dream  liam you can all argue over it but i hand it to mollymauk as well as the cats eye  matt okay so you begin concentrating another ten minutes on the cats eye  liam is it one spell one item  matt you choose one object to cast on  liam okay next  matt so wait another ten minutes  travis while hes concentrating on it can i sit down next to him and touch it  matt sure  sam touch it meaning his penis  travis yeah  liam 
none	 youre welcome internet  matt as calebs concentrating on it you reach out and touch the stone your body immediately  goes cold  sam oh hes dead he died  liam could have waited 11 minutes but no  matt your vision vanishes from your eyes as darkness fills your world your lids itch like  some sand or dirt now scrapes the inside of the skin and you rub them with your wrist your eyes  open to find yourself somewhere else the sky is moonlit and cloudless the starry night looking  down at you your clothes 
dung	 are not your own nor is your body a thick brown leather overcoat lined  in buckles wraps around your torso while sunweathered human skin marks your flesh you  notice your hands are dirty and thick with calluses as you clutch the very same yellow  polished stone in your left hand looking down you see the body of the individual who was its  previous owner now still in a pool of crimson dark you glance around the place some  junglegrown natural landmass by a pond the smell of seawater is strong on the wind in the 
none	 middle of  the night flash in your right hand grasps the familiar falchion water dripping from the blade  a voice booms into your mind potential a sudden uncontrollable hunger overcomes you as you  instinctually jam the stone into your gut it slowly sinks into your human flesh painlessly as  its being pushed into your torso consume as it quickly vanishes within your belly the hunger  subsides as exhaustion takes over you fall to your knees and look within the water your  reflection familiar but not your own vandrin reward just as quickly as the 
none	 vision came in  the blink of an eye its gone your reflection now that of the familiar halforc looking into  the pool where the stone was found but the stone is gone the rest of you guys watched in the  middle of this concentration while fjord touched the stone grabbed it and jammed it into his  chest before all of you could even react and push forward it had already been thrust through his  armor and into his body you reach over and try and grab him and with a strength youve never  felt 
none	 in his body he lurches towards the pond and thrusts it fully in seemingly under some sort of  uncontrolled force his eyes glazed over and staring forward suddenly he comes back and as  you glance around you feel tension on your body as all your friends are grabbing onto your body  and pull you away from the pool  marisha wheres the orb  matt its gone  sam what the fuck was that what just happened  travis how do i feel  matt exhausted  marisha are you clammy a little warm  matt you 
none	 actually take a point of exhaustion  laura can i touch his chest and his stomach  taliesin yeah check to see if theres a scar or anything  matt theres no damage to the armor and as you pull back some of the leather plates theres no  sign of a wound  travis i feel funny what happened  laura caleb did you identify it before it went into him what was it  travis into me  laura you have the thing in you  ashley its now in your chest  liam you grabbed the stone 
none	 before i had a chance to finish what i was doing why did you do that  travis i felt like id seen it before i just wanted to touch it  liam why  travis i dont know you ever see something you felt like youd seen in a dream before but you  dont know why or how  liam no  taliesin and laura yes  travis im sorry i felt compelled to i felt like there was half a chance id touch it and it  wouldnt be there i saw things  marisha like what 
none	  travis people i knew a man hes very dear to me i dont understand it but he was i was him  and he was holding the sphere the eye  liam i was him what does that mean  ashley who was he  travis again you ever have that dream where you look in the water and you see another face looking  back at you like youre someone else  sam and taliesin yes  laura and liam no  travis 5050 you said i put the sphere in my  laura yeah you stuck it 
dung	 into your chest  travis i saw him do i saw me as him doing the same thing he was standing over someone covered  in blood and he put the sphere inside of him  laura who was he  travis he was my mentor a captain of mine a man named vandrin  laura ive heard you say his name before  travis yes i havent seen him in quite some time i dont know what any of this means but im  not a fan of losing track of time like that  laura well what if 
none	 youre cursed now how do we know youre going to be okay you have a weird  thing inside of you  marisha yeah do you feel any heartburn or any constipation because that thing was big and its  travis i bend over and put my hands on my knees and  matt you dont feel any strange spheres in the inside of your abdomen  travis i dont feel anything i do feel pretty tired though  ashley what happened to vandrin  travis im not exactly sure he may be dead he captained a ship that i 
none	 worked on for many years  and there was an incident  sam did the ship sink  travis i believe so there was an explosion and we were in terrible weather there were waves we  were being thrown about and i was knocked overboard i never saw what happened to vandrin  but when i woke up i was back on shore and i didnt see anything of the ship or him or any of  the other crewmates  laura maybe hes alive and you were seeing through his eyes right now  travis i would like 
none	 that i would like that very much he was very good to me when a lot of people  in my life havent been but he was holding the sphere how could he be holding it if i was  laura maybe theres more than one  marisha maybe if you concentrate on his idea maybe you can feel him some way or maybe this  thing is like a beacon to him  sam or maybe hes cursed and hes going to turn evil and kill us all in our sleep  marisha maybe youre cursed  liam are 
none	 you skipping any details  ashley yeah how did you survive  battle music  laura gasps i feel like somethings going to attack us  taliesin roll for initiative  travis demonic voice ill tell you how i survived  matt dont spoil the surprise travis  marisha its a trauma film no  liam are you skipping any details  travis did i recognize the body that was lying in blood  matt no nobody youd seen before all you recall is seeing the orb and the same sword that you have  in his hand  travis 
none	 no no details i knew this man very well he was almost like a father to me and i never saw  him holding anything like this not that i remember do i ever remember seeing anything like  that in his quarters in his offices anything  matt no weirdly  travis its unique id remember  matt theres a strange aspect as you focus really hard to remember but the face that you saw in the  water was definitely vandrin maybe a little younger than you remember him faintly less gray  to his hair and facial 
dung	 hair  travis im not leaving anything out  ashley but how did you survive that  travis im not entirely sure i remember getting thrown overboard the waves overtaking me it was  a hell of a fight and im a real good swimmer but you’d come up for air one second and your  mouth would be full of salt water the next i remember losing track of which way was up its  funny when youre underwater and its dark the only way to tell which way is towards the surface  is by blowing bubbles i 
none	 did that as hard as i could with all the air that was in my lungs and  those bubbles disappeared i remember it stinging filling my chest and the next thing i knew i was  facedown on the shore  marisha sounds a lot like dying  travis yeah ive heard a lot of tales of men drowning being brought back they say that same  thing but no one was with me on that shore i was alone  laura maybe mermaids rescued you  sam or maybe your father is a sperm whale and thats how 
none	 you survived because youre half whale  or fish  laura maybe youre a mermaid and you dont know  sam i think that thats likely  ashley what kind of ship was it  travis just a merchant ship he had many  laura what was the explosion you talked about  travis there was a bit of sabotage on the ship  marisha a coup  travis i wish i knew if im lucky one of these days ill find out  marisha well might be sooner rather than later now  laura oh man thats totally weird 
none	  taliesin im going to walk up and take a look at this pool one more time i want to taste the  water is it fresh or salt  matt the water is salt water  travis the pool water  matt the pool water is salt water all the rest of the water in this cavern is fresh  marisha the pool water is salt water  matt yes  taliesin its sea water  ashley fjord what if you try jumping in this water  marisha i kind of agree with that  taliesin why were they 
none	 bringing religious iconography to this thing what were they trying  to do with it  marisha well this is all from what i can recognize deities that are not sanctioned by the  empire  travis but good and evil deities  marisha i mean things that are wanted that are illegal are going to be wanted it seems like  there was clearly a high demand for some people to worship who they want to  travis on the edge or around it right not in  matt yeah and you get make an intelligence check for me 
none	  liam i feel like were missing something  travis 16  matt looking at this and looking at the way things are spread about you get the sense that  something drew the merrow to the safe house they took whatever they found in the safe house below  tore through it and placed whatever was important to them in this area  sam they wanted this eye thing  laura that was the whole reason they attacked was what if they attack you now  travis for what  laura and sam for having the thing inside of 
none	 you  travis but you cant see it i dont have it  laura and sam maybe they can sense it  laura yeah  sam we solved it  laura we solved the mystery  liam im going to cast dancing lights and scour the room is there anything were missing  matt make an investigation check  travis how big is the well  matt its roughly five to eight feet in diameter  ashley what happens if you look over do you see yourself  travis oh shit thats not a bad call ill check my reflection 
none	 in the well  matt okay you look in the well the water is moving in there its you  taliesin im going to push his head underneath the water  matt splashing water sputtering salt water you start coughing for a minute and come up  taliesin anything  travis coughs once  laura hes coughing up salt water again  sam just like his dreams  travis try again  taliesin tap three times when youre done push him under  sam can you breathe can you breathe underwater  travis inhales  matt you are drowning  
none	 travis im tapping like a motherfucker  matt you pull him out of the pool he starts coughing up the water  travis coughing  taliesin were even for the teleport now  laura i dont think hes a mermaid anymore  taliesin of course its possible it hasnt actually had an effect on you yet either  sam or it can only be on the full moon or something  taliesin that doesnt make any sense  sam i know mythology  laura caleb can you detect magic on fjord can you sense anything  liam if you have 
none	 11 minutes to spare yes i can  sam can i just point out not to be a jerk  taliesin is this about whales  liam i begin ritual casting detect magic  matt as youre doing that you do get the sense that the longer youre here in a nexus between  these numerous merrow tunnels the higher your chance gets of having more arriving  liam oh man ritual casting  laura no let’s get out of here  taliesin this place is definitely making me nervous we should do our best to cut off this  
none	 particular flowthrough  marisha maybe they were gathering a bunch of these items because they were looking for the  exact one for this one  taliesin i think they were trying to activate it they were trying to please it  laura should we gather up all of the things and put them back up in the tree  sam can we put them all in the bag  travis anybody want any of the weapons shortswords longswords battleaxes  taliesin lets leave it exactly where theyre supposed to be so we did our job  sam what do 
none	 you mean where theyre supposed to be they stole it from the smugglers  taliesin were working for the smugglers well put it back in the safe house  laura okay well take it all back upstairs  matt you guys gather up as much as you can take your way via the rope through the water kiri in  tow you make your way back up handing things off up into the tunnel eventually over the next hour  or so get most of what was down there that you could back up into the safe house  laura 
none	 are any of the weapons that we found better than my handaxe  matt i mean theyre all what they are  marisha any dope bos  liam just one  laura youre beau youre looking for a staff  marisha bo staff  matt no quarterstaffs they all appear to be steel weapons that are part of this cache there  is a long polearm a halberd there’s two of them that does have a shaft of wood but its  designed for the weight of the bladed edge you could break it off and make it a quarterstaff 
dung	 if  you really wanted to but it would be comparable to what you already have  marisha no i have a staff  sam any shortswords better than my shortsword  matt theyre wellmade and fresh  sam i like mine do they seem sharper or deadlier  matt theyre less worn but theyre not deadlier per se  travis whos holding onto the brokenoff hilt  laura i put it in the bag  travis do you mind if i carry that  taliesin you know yeah  liam can i take 30 seconds to see if it 
none	 jogs my memory since im such a history buff  matt yeah make a history check  marisha can i assist him on that  matt sure  marisha you have assistance roll with advantage  liam nope big 13  matt doesnt jog your memory it looks old looks like its been around a while  marisha can i try and do it myself and do a ki point thing  matt unfortunately you already aided somebody with it  taliesin he wants to do this see if it does anything thats fair  laura dont try to stick 
dung	 this inside of you too though okay  travis no im not  sam were back up on the upper level  matt you guys are back in the safe house now yes  sam should we blow up the tunnel  taliesin if its possible i would love to cave this thing in  marisha do you have boom sticks still  sam i dont but two of us do wait do i  travis we have four sticks  laura wont the sound attract all of the things i feel like the sound will attract all of the 
none	  merrow people  marisha as long as were not here  taliesin i dont think theyre going to come up once were out of here theyd have to dig through  sam we have two of them among us  taliesin mind like a steel trap  liam i do not have any  travis i just said we have two sticks  liam i heard that but who’s got them  marisha whos got the sticks weve got sticks  liam i also have a propeller beanie and a bag of chips and i heard you say that

dung	  sam they were probably smugglers that were keeping the safe house for the gentleman  taliesin we did check them  laura they had manacles on them though didnt they that means they were slaves or something  sam or taken prisoner  taliesin theres lots you can do with manacles  travis okay all right  matt what are you guys doing  laura blowing up a cave i guess  travis climbing the rope back up top to the base of the tree  matt you guys get up you all get ready to go you gather 
none	 your things lighting dynamite watch  it sparking it disappears you begin to leave as you guys are all walking out of the storehouse  from behind you off to the left theres a dull sound and some dirt and water from the left side  of the tree in the middle of the hot afternoon muffled impact the still water that currently  exists around begins to slowly drain as a part of the swamp off to the side sinks down about ten  feet or so the water level drops a solid foot but it comes to rest 
none	 youre sure that whatever  structure that remained down there before is now filled with dirt sludge swamp water and rock  liam i hope we brought kiri with us  matt kiri is with you  sam oh my god  travis why would they do that  ashley can i take down the bodies that are on the trees  matt okay is anybody helping you with that  laura yeah ill help  liam nope  ashley leave them to rest in peace  matt jester and yasha start taking down the bloated bodies  laura why 
none	 are we doing this  ashley so that people know that we took care of it so its not a danger anymore  taliesin and to rifle through their pockets i imagine  matt sam and laura we already did  sam were the worst people ever  matt what are you doing with the bodies are you leaving them in the swamp to fester  laura should we put them in the water or something  ashley yeah food its the circle of life  matt singing circle of you take them and pull them offsite and leave them
