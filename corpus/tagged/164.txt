welcome back everyone last we left off the mighty nein after being in proximity to some  sort of an assault from xhorhasian operatives in the city of zadash here in the center of the  empire they found themselves also caught up in a murder of the highrichter in the city they  pulled away and realized there was a manhunt for individuals that were seemingly seen in connection  to this murder as this was transpiring they had to smuggle out some allies /none/ they had found and had  been working with dolan and horris dolan part of this whole deal was to get him involved in the  local politics horris needed to be smuggled out for safety in case they got caught you made your  way to the evening nip met up with yasha down there you had a conversation with this individual  called the gentleman you made a deal youve decided to trust each other on this endeavor and  basically do a quid pro quo a little favor to one favor for the other and see if /none/ this is a  business relationship you would want to develop in doing so horris was smuggled out of the city  safely seemingly  laura he keeps saying seemingly he keeps saying that  matt i keep saying that because you werent there to confirm i dont want to say that it happened  because the mysterys fun you were brought down through the tunnels to the underworks towards an  underground dock where the river that exited to the northeast towards berleben was you loaded up  on boats to make your way towards a recently uncovered but /none/ barely explored underground research  facility long buried the gentleman asked you to enter it see what you found clear it out if  possible and return as you made your way down there assailed by a few of the creatures that  existed in that tunnel you found the exterior of this research facility broke your way in began  to meander around and discover strange mysteries afoot in its construction the urns throughout the  vicinity the strange wisps of spiritual energy came to assault you in the process bypassing  traps mostly kind of  travis or /none/ not at all  matt completing the mystery of the strange arcane runes in the ceiling and the schools of magic that  they seemed connected to found your way into some sort of a secret study or den where there were  research tables set up and a mostly empty bookshelf braziers filled with ash to the side  between pillars two small chambers where these cages with tight knit bars remained containing  urns and empty nooses hanging above these urns filled with ash  you began to look throughout the room you found a sword across the /dung/ upper ceiling an ornamental  blade of some kind you recovered a book of notes and began to read through to get a feel for the  person the entity that seemed to have written what remained of these pages around this time  the wind began to pick up in the center of the chamber as this darkened figure began to rise out  of the stonework this large tattered cloak of a figure spreading whipping around like this  sudden wind is tossing aside sails of a dark ship this semiskeletal ghostly face of material began  to /none/ emerge from it its voice slowly hissing out my secrets are yours you saw small glows begin  to emerge from the ash and to the urns nearest the two of you that my friends is where we last  left off  laura thats right we marked our places on the map where we left last time  sam we did i was very intoxicated  matt as this thing emerges here it doesnt seem to at the moment make any sort of aggressive  maneuver what do you do  liam does it have any legs  matt /none/ imagine a figure that is wrapped in four or five layers of robes and the robes have been  shredded out all these moving tendrils of cloth and black shadow energy that are spinning around  in places its center chin and body are stationary the bottom half of its body seems to  taper into nothingness disappearing into cloth and evershifting and whipping material at the base  laura are you siff  matt the head turns over and locks onto jester doesnt answer  marisha he said he wants to tell us secrets or something i like secrets /none/  laura secrets are fun  marisha yeah secrets make friends  matt moaning glides slowly in your direction  sam give him something information news something  laura i have a secret for you did you know that in nicodranas the pastries are made with cinnamon  and here theyre not  laughter  matt theres a brief moment where the entitys head much like a young puppy confused by a  rattling sound in the distance snapping in jesters direction a secret for trade  marisha for trade what does that mean  matt you know what im /none/ going to pull the battle map  laura oh no  sam cinnamon was his most hated spice  laura i gave him a secret  sam he fucking hates cinnamon  laura oh no i thought i was helping  ashley you were you did great  matt hes drifted up to that point there  laura hes in the teleportation circle  sam ashley even you dont believe that  matt as you guys are preparing here the whispers begin to slowly spill out of its face voices  spreading out i need jester yasha and beau to /none/ all make a wisdom saving throw please  taliesin my clay pot is glowing  matt yes  marisha nine  laura 15  ashley 14  matt both of you succeed actually  marisha tell me something cool  matt the secrets begin to penetrate your ears you close off your consciousness and put your  hands up to close the space they dont seem to penetrate your mind beau however these words  start shooting into your brain you feel for a moment your grasp on reality begin to slip  suddenly the world begins to spin you /none/ feel yourself assaulted from all angles you see  flashes of ancient warfare of giant columns of fire crashing from the cosmos you spin your staff  around retroactively i need you to make an attack against yasha please  marisha im sorry boo its not good an 11  matt whats your armor class  marisha no sorry ten  matt im pretty sure that doesnt hit you  ashley 14  matt you see beau suddenly her eyes go wide swing the staff wide in your direction you  deflect it with your blade  marisha fuck you /none/ genghis khan  matt now i need you all to roll

travis natural one  laura that was the weirdest cutest hiccup ive ever heard  taliesin thank you  matt at this moment nott you see this entity as it suddenly begins to emanate these whispers into  the air your friends start all of a sudden grasping their faces you see beau /none/ try and swing  at yasha chaos is breaking loose what are you doing  sam i run i run as fast as i can screaming  matt where are you going  sam i make a beeline for the opposite corner bonus action dash keep going  matt over here  sam yeah behind that cage  laura theres going to be a thing that comes out there i think  sam oh well ill be first to kill it then then action i will hand crossbow up and hold until i  see it make an aggressive action /none/ towards one of my acquaintances were not quite friends yet  matt good to know yasha your turn  ashley are we attacking him  travis what do you want to do  matt what does yasha want to do what is yashas instinct  ashley i feel like we got off on the wrong foot i dont know if he has feet  laughter  matt you do not see a foot on his body no  ashley shit already off to a bad start you said my secrets are yours did you want to give  us a /none/ secret  matt ive

hit  ashley whats going on at the bottom of his  travis whats all this action down here  matt thats a dormant runic circle that has been lying there doesnt seem to be reacting to his  presence at all  laura maybe we can activate it  /none/ ashley shit i dont like going first okay im going to attack with my sword  matt okay youre holding off on rage  ashley no  matt youre raging  ashley im raging i would like to rage  matt you bonus action rage you angrily grit your teeth and rush up swinging your sword in the air  make your attack  ashley 18  matt 18 hits roll damage  laura kill that floating dude maybe he just flies maybe hes got feet and his robes cover  them up  taliesin hes tucking  laura yeah /none/  taliesin he could tuck  ashley eight plus  matt plus rage damage ten right ten total you rolled five plus three for your strength plus  two for your rage that would be a total of ten  ashley yeah ten  matt with which weapon is this  ashley my moontouched sword  matt which is technically baseline magical so okay  sam baseline magical  matt meaning its a very minor magical effect as you strike your blade carves through part of its  body some of the cloth tears apart and he tries to grasp /none/ around the blade as you pull it free from  nearby its face its eyes click back towards you when i say eyes you now get a look and its  these vacant holes and this tightly pulled skin against this skeletal face black energy is  billowing out of it like smoke is slowly pouring out of the sockets thats your turn  ashley yes thats my turn  matt now out of the side cages these glows all begin to emerge as four more of these wisp  entities you had previously encountered in the chamber begin to /none/ shift through the cages towards  the nearest source of life this ones going to go towards nott this ones going to stay right there  with molly this ones going to go after fjord as well as this one there on that note against nott  the attack is a seven that is a low roll i do not think that hits you as you see it emerge you  freak out as it swings by and ducks into the wall briefly before reemerging shifting through the  actual stone against molly another seven  taliesin ha ha  /none/ matt two threes in a row two against you fjord thats better thats a 20  travis that hits  matt the two of them begin to hit you from both sides youre not quite sure how to defend one of  them seems like its about to sweep at you you go to deflect it as the other one slaps into the back  of your head as you feel this shock energy hit you in the base of the skull your eyes go white for a  second you take 11 oh no sorry i rolled the wrong /none/ dice for that one you take five points of  lightning damage  travis excellent he takes ten points of ice damage or frozen damage or whatever  laura and travis froyo damage  matt you see the ice crystals coalesce around the outside not doing quite as much damage as you  would have expected  travis oh from hitting my frozen porcupine armor thats not great  matt the other ones going to try and use that moment to swing at you and rob you of a little  more life force that is going to be a /none/ 12 what is your armor class  travis oh that misses 15  matt miss then just swings past you the orbs now are glowing and sparking preparing for the  next round of assault  marisha this is all the notes from what we learned about siff duthar  matt the next is going to be the entity in the center  marisha i think he is a being of fire and ice so i bet hes immune to fire and ice  matt the entity is going to use its howling babble ability every creature within 30 feet /none/ of  it that can hear it has to make a wisdom saving throw so thats all of you guys  sam me too  laura can you hear it  matt counting youre just 30 feet outside of it  sam when it does this do i release my arrow  matt you would yes  sam okay i will release my arrow bolt thats not good 14  matt 14 hits roll damage  taliesin natural 20  sam what do i get 3d6 right one for the hit and then thats 18 points of damage but it /none/ is not a  magical weapon  matt it is not so it is less affected by the wound as it strikes through its body you see it  tear through some of the material and part of the matter the energy disperses the moment of impact  it damaged it but something about it being between the planes and its essence is making it  not as effectively damageable with regular weaponry  sam hoo boy what save were we making  matt that would be the wisdom save  travis 17  marisha natural one  liam 14 /none/  sam natural one  cheering  travis really  laura 12  taliesin 25  ashley eight  travis and laura were in so much trouble  ashley guys were doing fine  matt beau jester yasha and nott as this faint energy begins to disperse throughout the chamber  you hear thousands of voices trying to whisper into your ears simultaneously theyre not making  sense and as they weave your whole body begins to go catatonic your muscles tense and you fall  to your knees youre all paralyzed until the end of your next turn  /none/ travis oh no were in big trouble you guys  matt its going to fly up and back  laura wait i have a question when were paralyzed does that mean every attack against us  is a critical  matt every melee is if it hits that ends its turn that brings us to beau youre paralyzed so  at the end of your turn it fades sorry not paralyzed stunned its not paralyzed its stunned  marisha stunned  matt correct it is not i had to read  marisha what can i do  matt stunned means /none/ you cant really do anything this turn but half make a sentence youre aware  of your surroundings but you cant take actions or move at the end of your turn it wears off  marisha im going to be like the fire and ice from the book and the lost sword and all that  shit remember  matt that ends beaus turn  marisha yeah  matt caleb youre up  liam seeing how terrible everything is around me i stick a quivering hand into my pocket and pull  out a little copper wire i learned how /none/ to do this from nott i cup it in my hands and i cast  message to the thing im going to text you what im only it can hear me and im sending it to you  sam digital whispers  liam while backing against the wall behind me  matt you back up against the wall there that ends your turn caleb  liam i will send frumpkin skittering down by yashas feet  matt jester and molly jester you are no longer stunned that is your turn  laura okay im done  matt molly  taliesin /none/ im going to try and break the pot in through the cage im going to take a swipe at the  pot through the cage with my sword  matt okay the cage because the slits are very small you cannot get your full hand in there so  with the blade there you might be able to get it so make an attack roll with disadvantage  taliesin nine  matt just misses you strike the outside of it but the blow you watch as the urn rocking in place  taliesin im going to swing around and try /tavern/ to get another shot  matt you pull it out and jab once more towards it  taliesin stop doing that youll get everyone drunk even worse thats actually a natural one  laura theyre making so much money tonight  matt apparently  ashley thats already 500  matt as your blades are getting caught in the cage and try to pull it out the large wisp is  slowly pushing towards your body  taliesin im going to run towards im in combat with it it gets an attack of opportunity if i  run doesnt it im /none/ going to steady myself and prepare for another attack  matt fjord  taliesin nott deal with this  travis im going to cast eldritch blast into the pot in the bottom of the cage  matt okay with disadvantage because youre aiming through the smaller space it actually has  cover its largely just a small space youre shooting through  travis thats not going to hit thats a three plus 11  matt 11 does hit  travis oh does it wait i added that wrong hold on stuttering im pretty sure i added that wrong  liam /tavern/ porky pig stuttering  matt your spell attack modifier  travis yeah no thats only a nine  matt yeah that doesnt hit unfortunately youre trying to shoot the remainder and manage to hit  the bar and the bar bends back a little bit from the impact of the blast however its not  actually hitting the urn on the inside  travis great cool awesome can i run can i use my speed are they both in melee range  matt yes they are  travis high pitched laugh okay  ill stay right where i am then /none/  matt all right fjord top of the round again nott you manage to grunt shrug off the stun  but thats the end of your turn  sam oh great im sorry i couldnt help  matt yasha you shrug off the stun thats the end of your turn all right  ashley okay ah fuck  matt with that all the wisps begin to close in once more on their targets molly thats a 23  taliesin thats a number yeah that hits  matt you take six points of lightning damage as it shocks you from the /none/ side again the other one  striking against you nott that is going to be a 15 to hit  sam 16  matt 16 armor class you manage to duck out of the way of this one as well this one is beginning  to flicker angrily as it cant seem to grasp and tear any sort of life force from you with shock  sam no get away  matt two against you fjord that is a ten six plus four  travis misses  matt misses the other one is a 16  travis stuttering that hits /none/  matt thats five points of lightning damage  travis ten points of cold damage to that particular wispy bastard  matt which it takes a reduced amount that ends their turn now well see if the howling babble  it does not regenerate that ability it does not recharge it now as the spectral entity begins to  fly back towards this side its going to shift over in this direction were going to say that  its gliding up near this pillar here its about 20 feet up right by where the ceiling is and  its glaring /none/ down at everybody  sam he doesnt make an attack or anything  laura hes about to  sam oh shit oh man  matt its going to go ahead and use actually its not because youre all too far away  instead its going to coast down towards the one that struck at it last turn rush right there  laura are his robes floating around him all cool like a nazgûl  matt between that and a deathly hallow look but even more intense like an epic deathly hallow  its going to go ahead and attempt a /none/ maddening touch against you yasha  sam shes already raging shes mad  matt that is a 16 to hit  ashley yeah  matt all right you suffer thats actually a really shitty roll for him nine points of psychic damage  taliesin hmm thats a shitty roll  matt plus three sorry 12 points of psychic damage  laura thats a less shitty roll  matt then its going to go ahead and attempt to fly back up into where it was in the ceiling  after it makes its strike  laura all im hearing in my /none/ head is careless whisper now  taliesin do you get an attack of opportunity  travis doesnt she have sentinel  matt oh you would get an attack of opportunity against it  marisha yes sentinel  matt thats right sentinel feat oh this might fuck it up as it comes down and strikes at you  you feel this burst of maddening intent shower into your head it sparks your brain with this  horrible searing pain you guys watch as yasha screams out and begins to withdraw with that she  all of a sudden clicks back into /none/ reality and swings wide with the sword what did you roll  ashley 18  matt 18 hits go ahead and roll damage  cheering  matt which means he cant move the sentinel feat prevents him from moving  travis boom speed is zero  ashley can i also add divine fury on  matt yes you may could have done that last round too but forgot  ashley i know  sam shut up matt  laughter  travis plus five for your strength and rage  ashley counting plus what  travis plus five  matt yeah /none/ with your rage its whatever you rolled plus five and then plus half your level  plus seven technically  travis oh wow  ashley 11  travis is that a divine thing  ashley whoa whats happening in my brain 13 plus seven you said 20  matt 20 points of oh man thats nasty as it tries to pull away you click back into reality  and swing wide with your sword as you do you cut right through the center of its body out the  other end you watch as the robe splinters open you see /dung/ this glowing pulse of dark energy in the  center as it guttural wail it has to fight to reform its semicorporeal form it looks like  its hurt pretty bad  sam oh man nice  matt yasha that ends your turn  ashley that was my attack of opportunity  matt oh thats right it was an attack of opportunity sorry that was the creatures turn  beau youre up  marisha okay im going to im good right im going to run up and pull out that holy water that  i didnt use before im going /none/ to parkour off of yashas shoulder and spike it right at his feet  matt all righty go ahead and roll your ranged attack d20 plus your proficiency  marisha okay i dont know if thats good 16  matt that hits roll 2d6  ashley ill make my body all strong  marisha eight  matt it takes eight points of radiant damage as it splashes on its form the flames suddenly begin  to ignite across the front of its cloaked exterior because holy flames are licking up the  side of it and burning and its rasping /none/ cry  marisha okay i still have my opportunity attack i mean my sorry my secondary attack  matt its a ranged attack roll ill say sure usually you get the bonus on a punch you have to  move up to do it though  marisha i did move up i said i ran up next to yasha and spiked it i parkoured off her  shoulders spiked it  matt sure good call  marisha i want to do flurry of blows  matt two more punch attacks or unarmed  marisha 19 and 15 to hit  /none/ matt both of those hit  marisha that is an additional six sorry 12 damage  matt 12 damage you rush up off the shoulder after slamming it against the ground you come up  with a punch and an uppercut from underneath as your fists impact its like punching through  heavy cold cloth you feel like almost youre punching nothing as you do while youre  impacting youre not sure how much damage its doing whoosh  marisha okay thats fair  matt that ends your turn beau caleb youre up  liam i didnt see any difference /none/ in it when i did what i did ja  matt you didnt seem to notice anything  liam how close could i get to it if i wanted to walk straight at it  matt you could get right up to it  liam right up to it could i get right behind no ill get right up to it ja  matt all right you can get right there  liam yeah okay im going to cast burning hands veered away so that it does not touch yasha it  has to make a dexterity saving throw  /none/ matt its a 15 foot cone correct  liam ja  matt you can from the edge of where youd be would be there you can technically no it would  not quite hit that but you can hit the creature  liam ja the creature is fine  matt it makes its save that is a seven  liam its 3d6 halved  matt whats up  liam did it make it  matt it rolled a seven on its dc so no  liam oh no it did not make it it takes 11 points  matt 11 /none/ okay half of that the fire doesnt seem to have as much impact largely because of  its ghostly form most things it seems to be resistant towards but its still taking damage as  youre doing this now its being flanked from all of you guys that ends calebs turn jester  molly youre up  taliesin pots people pots  laura i mean we should take those out too  taliesin im useless on the pots im actually going to try and make a book for the cloaked guy  im going to yelling at everyone hit the /none/ pots hit the bloody pots  matt counting you have to get over here to  taliesin thats fine  travis who has that sword we pulled off  liam jester  matt first off the willowisp makes a strike at you attack of opportunity  marisha i bet he wants his sword back  matt 18  taliesin that hits  matt as you rush past 16 points of lightning damage  taliesin oh my god really  matt i rolled double eights on d8s the willowisp suddenly as you try to rush it  actually darts in front /none/ of you you run towards it and it actually passes through your entire  torso as it does shocking your lungs and heart and for a second your heart doesnt beat then  kicks back in your whole body feels cold but you keep running you push past caleb and get right up  next to the creature  travis need a defib  taliesin yeah pots people im going to take two strikes with the radiant swords thats a 15  to hit  matt 15 hits  taliesin an eight to hit  matt eight does not hit /none/ unfortunately  taliesin okay thats all right  matt the pain is too strong on one strike and you go wide but you turn around and all of a sudden  theres a moment of clarity as the pain clicks in you clench your jaw and swing back striking true  taliesin does it do extra radiant damage i mean because i do an extra bonus radiant damage if it  takes it  matt you do the extra three anyway because its undead  taliesin oh so yeah thats counting 11 points of radiant damage  matt how much /none/ is the sword how much is the radiant  taliesin six is radiant and the rest is the sword  matt five all right cool it takes less damage from the swords but the radiant does go through  its looking pretty beat up at this point now between the different attacks youve done its  starting to freak out now its trying to figure out how best to deal with its situation that ends  your turn molly jester what are you doing  laura im going to pull out my symbol of the traveler and im going to /none/ say okay i hope  youre with me right now because i really need your help im going to try to turn undead  matt from where youre standing  laura no im going to jump up behind frumpkin  matt you dart over this direction whats the radius on that 30 feet  laura 30 feet  matt thatll catch all three of those and the guy was it wisdom saves against your spell dc  laura wisdom save yes  travis i dont really like my position right now  matt no youre in a bad place  /none/ laura it has to make a wisdom saving throw yes  matt far end willowisp right there that would be a six no that one nope that one over there  is going to attempt as well thats a nine no so that one is also turned the one over there is  fleeing that is going to be a 16 that does succeed  laura 16 succeeds  matt the main guy natural 20 these two wisps now are slightly you rush up and you pray for a  second and hope you know this inspiration hits you as /none/ you clasp the symbol suddenly the strange  little archway on the top of the symbol begins to glow theres this large burst of deep blue energy  that radiates outward as it strikes it washes over the main creature with no effect as it hits  the two other side willowisps both of them shiver and begin to shift away looking like  theyre actually running in fear as fast as they can from jester in the center thats your action  laura thats my action and for my bonus action im

and its body is flickering having a hard time keeping itself together on this  side of reality does this end your turn yasha  ashley yeah the little interior bit what is it again  matt you see this dull blue glow thats now visible from where you struck through it it looks  like its falling apart  laura shouting steal his heart take his heart  matt yasha /none/ that ends your turn  ashley can i

travis disadvantage or regular  matt regular  travis 14  matt 14 does not hit you go to strike and unfortunately it just makes it into the pillar and  you hit stone and sparks off of it it does take one point of force damage from spending its turn  inside the wall now it is the entitys turn it /none/ is going to attempt well see if its howling  babble returns it gets its howling babble back  taliesin were all right here  matt oh man i forgot that i need all of you to roll a wisdom saving throw please  travis does that affect his wisdom ability checks the hex  matt nope  liam natural 20

throw against my sanctuary because you did  a harmful spell against me right  matt let me look at the  sam any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack must first make a wisdom saving throw  matt its not technically targeting the creature youre just in the radius of whats happening  sam the spell doesnt protect the warded creature from area effects  matt unfortunately whatd you roll  laura i didnt roll anything yet  matt well now you get to roll  laura ten  matt no  /none/ taliesin 18  ashley i rolled a four  matt no  ashley i was trying to see it as a positive thing  matt

floor  taliesin i get an attack of opportunity  matt you and caleb both get an attack of opportunity physically  ashley do i  matt youre stunned  ashley fuck  matt as it begins to shift into the ground  taliesin that hits thats 20 thats five points of normal damage and five points of radiant damage  matt how do you want to do this  cheering  taliesin i want to swing and pin the heart to the ground and leave the blade there  matt as it tries /none/ to shift downward molly pulling back from the screams and strange howling  babble emanating from its body you swing wide spinning the blade in the air and jam down on top  of its form as you do it disperses like an explosion of wind from the center you watch the  cloth of its body suddenly scatter like someone had blown a heavy wind into a stack of loose cloth  that all eventually turns into ash and vanishes there you see a dull blue glow where the sword is  grinding against the stone before that eventually /none/ dissipates into nothingness  marisha yeah ghostslayer  taliesin last pot  ashley good job molly  matt beau your stun wears off  marisha that guy knew way too much about everything  matt caleb  liam can i see that last pot from where i am  matt make a perception check  liam okay that is a 13  matt 13 glancing about in the area with torchlight from yasha you can see one visible pot  that has not been shattered in that cage  liam okay i will send a little firebolt off and try /none/ to strike it its at disadvantage correct  okay thats very bad also very bad thats a ten  matt a ten just barely misses you attempt to strike through and it smashes against the wrought  iron gate on the outside and disperses against it  liam ja i will walk toward it to get closer as much as i can  matt you can get right up to it if you want to  liam i should have done that first ja  matt that brings us to jester and molly  laura im unconscious  taliesin im /none/ going to run over to you and put a healing  laura dont

dont think i have anything that will fit through that little hole i could try  picking up a rock on the ground and throwing it at it  matt you can make /none/ an investigation check to try and find a rock on the ground  laura i probably dont see one if i did it would take a whole lot of time  matt well you took your action searching the ground  laura three  matt you do not find a rock you spend the better part of six seconds going wait ah no its a  piece of black cloth shit no actual stone unfortunately sorry jester  laura no its fine  matt fjord youre up  travis ill spin around and try and eldritch blast that last pot /none/ in the other cage at  disadvantage thats a 19  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  laura i just woke up you guys  travis thats 11 points of damage  matt 11 points of damage nice with that that pot shatters and you see this flicker in the  stone column behind as the energy of the wisp flares out from the side  travis got him  laura good job  matt nott yasha you guys doing anything  ashley im still stunned  matt no actually your stun has worn off nott you /none/ doing anything oh youre stunned as well  your stun now wears off as you guys finish shaking off the energy this cold energy begins to  emerge from the far wall through the bookcase  laura oh no hes back okay we run away  matt the same entity comes through the bookcase like its emerging from something behind  laura grab his heart and run from the ground  taliesin there was no heart on the ground  matt as you struck it the energy dispersed  laura lets run away  ashley what if we have to /none/ get it with the sword  laura its a twohanded weapon i cant do it  marisha yasha can though  travis why youre strong you can do it  laura i cant use twohanded weapons  matt as you guys watch it push out of the wall gasping sound making its way there  marisha wait maybe if we show it the sword hell chill out  matt caleb make an intelligence check you make a religion check with advantage because you have undead  liam just a straight intelligence  matt straight intelligence modifier  liam 15  /none/ taliesin 12  matt after reading through the notes and going through the book you recall that a lot of the  magic in here entails binding the soul to the remains of the physical form as youve seen with  all of the wisps it is a similar return of the entity you just fought  laura oh his bodys somewhere  marisha wheres that corkscrew thing  matt on its turn its going to attempt first lets see if it gets its howling babble back it  does not its a one so its going to try whispers /none/ of madness again i need only yasha and  beau actually everyone else is spread out yasha and beau i need you both to make a wisdom saving  throw as the whispers now begin to emanate from its mouth  taliesin its coming from the bookcase  marisha thats better 16  matt you watched it emerge through the bookcase 16 okay yasha  ashley seven  matt seven so beau  marisha wait we have the book that we found in the research center  matt beau you resist the whispers and close your eyes and as you /dung/ come up to try to make this  point next thing you see is yasha looking at you and swoosh down with your sword make an attack  against beau  ashley oh shit  taliesin do i see this  matt you do  taliesin im going to quickly cast before this goes i dont know  matt well no you got it  taliesin im going to cast one level  matt your vision as this happens all of a sudden goes black you watch as this dark blood  pools at the corners of yashas face as /none/ you go blind from his blood maledict so roll with  disadvantage on the attack  ashley yeah disadvantage would mean it was  matt lowest one  ashley the lowest number okay i didnt know if it okay three oh sorry five six  matt you see it just in time and bat it out of the way it hits the stone next to you you do  suffer 11 points of psychic damage however  ashley okay im unconscious  matt you watch as she swings at you and the impact as you parry it yasha goes down /none/ with the  blade swing onto the ground  sam did you just kill her  taliesin nope  ashley i do have hold on i thought i had something  matt theres an ability you get at later levels that does something in this scenario  ashley its not now  matt dont think you have something for that right now i could be wrong  ashley im unconscious  matt ill double check just to be safe  liam the book said the soul is bound to the flesh be it in any form ice or ash but /none/ the ash in the  pots was the willowisp  marisha it says from ashes i shall rise again  laura maybe theres something behind the bookcase  sam lets go look  matt that ends the creatures turn as that happens its going to lift up and vanish into the  ceiling you watch it disappear out of place it does take force damage for being in the wall  thats actually a good roll six force damage to it you have the divine energy path zealot and  your soul is marked for battle the only ability you /none/ have now is the warrior of the gods you dont  have the other one yet  ashley right okay  matt that finishes its turn beau youre up you watch yasha slam on the ground unconscious next  to you the blade clattering to the ground and coming to rest the creature lifts up wheezing  and vanishes into the stone above you  marisha i cant get a reaction from it as it goes  matt it was not close enough to you unfortunately  marisha fuck im going to run over to this bookcase and put my /none/ staff behind it to see if i  can knock it over  matt you get the staff on the fulcrum go ahead and make an athletics check to force it  travis come on singing get it girl get it get it girl  marisha fuck that keeps happening six  matt you try and grunt and its starting to rock but its heavy you start pushing you cant  quite get the bookcase to come over unfortunately that ends your turn  marisha i guess so  matt that brings us to caleb  liam i am going /none/ to start moving towards the middle towards yasha i dont have any healers  kit or anything i dont know how to do anything like that  ashley its okay get the bookcase  sam youre going to die  liam im going to hold my attack a fire bolt can i do that i am a wizard for the first time  can i hold a fire bolt  matt you can hold it as an action youre casting the spell then whenever something triggers it  you release it  liam yeah when it appears  laura its /none/ immune to fire  liam we dont know that  matt it seemed to take damage though lesser when you hit it  liam resistant to fire theres nothing else i can do from where i am  laura can you catch fire to the bookcase  liam i dont want to burn the room around us  matt jester molly  laura should i try to heal yasha or move the bookcase im the strong one  taliesin move the bookcase  liam if i set it on fire someone will still have to pull it anyway its not /none/ like its going to disintegrate  laura i can use my last spell i have a 2ndlevel spell im going to bonus action use healing  word at 2ndlevel on yasha to bring her back and then im going to run over and try to crash the  bookcase down  matt you go ahead and expend your bonus action roll for that 2d4 plus your wisdom modifier  laura six plus four ten  matt you heal ten hit points yasha you come to consciousness on the ground your weapon is about  two feet from your grasp the /none/ first thing you do your eyes shoot open and then shoot to your  weapon natural instinct to defend yourself its easily within your grasp you just have to get up  to grab it  laura can i get all the way over to the bookcase  matt counting 30 you get right to the bookcase  laura i try to yank it over  matt make an athletics check  marisha can i give her some assistance  matt that would be your action to do so youve already tried the dc is going down as you both /dung/  are working on it  laura 16  matt as you grab and reach around the side with beau you pull on the bookcase creaking you  step back quickly as it slams onto the ground  laura is there anything behind it  matt right behind it theres a small pocket where the stone seems to have crumbled a bit it looks  like a dark space on the inside  sam how small  matt its about that wide on the wall  sam whats in there  laura i bet its remains are in there kill /none/ it  matt all right does that end your turn jester  laura i dont think i can do anything else  matt thats all youve got molly  taliesin im going to run over to it and start taking slices at it im going to stab it with my sword  matt you have darkvision so as both you and jester glance inside you can see there is a small  five foot by five foot chamber inside where there are a number of pots and small cases it was a  small burial chamber of some kind there /none/ in the center you see this large urn about a foot and a  half wide squat a dull gray color you have no color depth in this darkness unfortunately with  your darkvision but its this very squat wellmade vase or urn of some kind  taliesin mmhmm two shots  matt youre having to put your arm through and swing towards it so disadvantage on each strike  taliesin all right first one is 13 to hit  matt 13 just barely hits but its a hardy urn well see how much damage you deal  taliesin thats /none/ eight points of damage  matt eight points of damage you make impact and you see a part of it crack from the blow but its  not enough to shatter it  taliesin im taking another swing  matt as you pull it out and jam the other arm in to go for a straight strike with your scimitar  taliesin thats 17 to hit  matt 17 hits roll damage  taliesin thats five points of damage  matt as you reach through you feel the urn break beneath the blow theres this moment of silence  as /none/ you hear this low gasp dully filter out the entity slowly shifts from the ceiling as you watch  it disintegrate not vanishing like it did before but slowly dissipating its form suddenly goes  from extremely menacing to almost sad as you watch it turn to nothingness  liam poofs out into a doughnut as a fire bolt goes fwoosh  laughter  marisha smoke grenade thats awesome  liam i got it  marisha mushroom cloud that was great  travis like rick moranis in ghostbusters 2  taliesin is there any way to get in there  /none/ matt it looks like its holed up the small hole looks like somebody tried to push through or  previously emerged and bricked what they could you cant fit through the hole unfortunately  taliesin im going to start trying to open it up i want to go in there look for things and break  every damn  laura wait we should heal you guys should we take a short rest and heal up a little bit  travis we should take a short rest a breather yeah  ashley jester thank you for healing me i feel like /none/ i did not deserve that but thank you very much  laura oh youre welcome you deserved it so much you did so good  sam oh boy ive already used most of my hit dice thats crazy  matt you guys take a short rest of about an hour or so as you sit down and recover your breath  take a moment to center yourself tend to your wounds  sam after weve rested for a while can i walk over to the little hole and peek in i cant fit  through that little hole can i /none/  matt youre pretty tiny make an acrobatics check this is one of the benefits of being  something so small  sam all right ten  matt ten you just manage to pull through it wasnt a hard  sam ill take off my stuff give it to caleb for safekeeping and do you have any butter or anything  laura lets see let me look in my possessions i dont think i have any butter  sam i dont want to get wet  marisha ive got a little bit of oil  sam oh yeah oil ill /none/ take some oil  taliesin i use all my hit dice when i heal because of tough right there was something i got  sam matt im asking beau to slather me in oil  matt grease the goblin action is what youre taking  sam get it in there work it in mmhmm  matt no not for tough it gives you additional hit points theres another feat that does that  taliesin i feel like i got that though  matt you got tough for the additional hit points  taliesin was there something else that does that /none/  matt durable is the one feat that gives you 1 constitution when you roll hit dice  taliesin i feel like there was a thing ill have to keep reading  marisha ill give you a little bit of a therapeutic temple rub while im at it  sam im going to slip n slide my way into the hole  matt you take a moment back and run and dive in the greased goblin squeezes through the small gap  it scrapes your shoulders and hurts a bit you tumble in which is great because you land in /none/ the  remains of the ash you are covered in grease which all sticks to you  screaming  travis the worst its the worst  matt you got ashed and feathered tarred and what do you call it oiled and ashed  sam its cool guys its fun  travis suddenly im scared of falling on the beach  liam i send in two globules after her to see the antiqued goblin  matt its a small chamber its five foot by five foot anyone else is going to be pretty down in  there but you fit in /none/ fairly comfortably theres the shattered urn and a few small pieces of  pottery with intricate gold scrolling theyre probably very nice pieces of art or decor  sam im going to check for traps  matt go ahead and make an investigation check  sam one  travis natural  sam uhhuh  marisha what is that 600 700  ashley six  marisha are you counting ash  ashley i am but i might have lost count  liam it takes the edge off  ashley yeah it does  marisha ive never seen so many people happy /none/ for a natural one  matt as best you can tell the room seems safe  sam all right you said theres a few urns that are fancier than the others  matt there are two large ones nowhere near as big as the central urn thats been shattered but  theres two in the corner and a few small boxes off to the side  sam whats in the urns  matt you glance over the inside and they are empty they look to be pieces of art that may have  meant something to the person who previously /none/  sam will they fit through the hole  matt you may have to dig the hole open a little bit  ashley i can dig it open a little bit  travis yeah you can  ashley and travis slamming  matt given a little time yasha begins to peel the stones from the wall around it  sam those boxes can i check in those  matt yeah which one theres one on each side  sam ill take the right one  matt okay so you take the right one you lift the lid and as you /none/ do you pull it open and  powder emerges into your face make a constitution saving throw  sam constitution save that would be a four  matt four okay you take nine points of poison damage and youre poisoned for the next hour  sam oh god  matt this cloud enters your lungs and you begin coughing it burns the inside of your throat  liam hey nott hows it going in there  sam great its fine im going to cast mage hand and open the other one  matt there we go laughter  liam its /none/ a five feet by five  matt its five by five  liam youre in a tiny why dont you bring that thing out of there  sam no ive got this im fine ill find the treasure theres nothing else in there  matt no theres nothing else you look down into the box there are sets of gold and silver rings  and jewelry it looks like whatever jewelry once may have been dressed upon the individual who was  interred in that urn that was scattered this is where their jewelry was placed  sam im going /none/ to take all of those things  marisha bring the art out too  sam sure as soon as the hole gets bigger ill open the other box with my magey handy  matt okay that box opens up and theres another splash of that same poisonous powder but youre  off to the side it only gets anyone whos immediately in front of the box  sam i did it guys  liam i feel like notts head comes out of the hole going rapid gasping for fresh air  sam whats in that box  matt that box /dung/ contains a folded raiment of some kind like a ceremonial mantle made of dark black  and gray cloth with red embroidered designs on it  sam do i recognize any symbols or anything  matt make an arcana check  sam natural one  travis yay thats seven  matt you are knocking it out of the park for charity  marisha theyre like we didnt anticipate this  sam everyone i found a piece of clothing an article of hacking cough clothing here ill  pass it out to you  laura is it pretty  sam its /none/ very pretty some art pieces some objets dart  marisha rich people love fancy art  laura can i look at the art do i know the artists  matt from the giant boxes you mean  laura i dont know whats going on  matt the art are two large wellmade vases that you eventually pull through the space here  laura well thats not as cool  matt you dont recognize it these were made a long time ago  laura ooh theyre antique  ashley could be worth a pretty penny  marisha yeah  travis what /dung/ about that cloak  laura i put them in the bag how about that  matt okay you have the folded mantle  taliesin what does the mantle look like  matt the mantle is a dark black a front chest mantle area with gray stripes coming along the  sides and this red embroidered design that emerges from around the neck all across the front and  back of the mantle  taliesin does it look familiar  matt no  taliesin i was hoping  travis can i come up and see if it has any magic feel /none/ to it  matt i mean you can make an arcana check to see if you recognize any elements of it  liam i am stowing away the journal in there  travis 17  matt you get a closer look and you can see parts of the edges are burned the very bottom parts of  it seem to have been committed to some sort of flame the edges of it are singed a bit the black  collar causes it to be lost at a distant view but close up you can see where its been damaged  /none/ theres a fold at the front of it a small pocket right there  travis weird looks like its been burned a bit its got a little compartment in the front  liam like a kangaroo pouch  travis i dont know  matt kind of its on the side because a mantle would go down to about there for someone wearing  it you put your hand in there and its a heavy material  travis you want to try it on  liam i would prefer to inspect it are we going to stay here for a little /none/ while  marisha while all of this is going on beau wants to be going through some of these books that were  on the shelf that we knocked over  matt the shelf is mostly empty  travis there was that one book on the desk  liam we could sit down on the floor together and have a look  taliesin what else did you get out of there  matt you have the urns in the cages you have the tables over there you have the two braziers  filled with ash on the sides you have /none/ the broken cages back there everything that you see there is  whats in the chamber  marisha im going to do a tour of the urns and see if theres anything jewelry or something  hidden in there  matt make an investigation check  liam also what i would recommend if we feel comfortable sitting down for a moment is to put  all of our findings in the middle of the room and i can ritually see which of these things are  magic most of these things we suspect but maybe there are some other things /none/ then i can tell what  exactly they are i need some time  taliesin that is a good idea  liam also before nott even got out im stowing the journal away for a closer read  matt okay totally fine  marisha 21  matt 21 okay you go through from cage to cage the urns are scattered ash nothing catches your  eye from those two the nooses you pull through and tug on and the rope rots and breaks in your  grasp you go past the brazier on that side with the ashes and you /none/ poke around with your staff  and something catches your staff underneath the ash you prod in there and as you push it aside  theres an object in the ash that is partially burned as you pull it free and dust it off its  another book a large portion of the back of it is burned off and most of the pages are destroyed on  the back end but a good half of the book is mostly still intact like when it got thrown in  there to be destroyed the flame wasnt quite strong enough to /none/ consume the entire book  marisha can i do a little flip through of it  matt yeah as you go through its filled with strange script and scrolling make an arcana check  marisha can i use a ki point to get advantage  matt you can  marisha ill mark that down really quick ill take that 11 over that two 13  matt 13 you dont understand the nature of any of this but it seems magical in nature the  script and elements of design remind you of the things you saw on the ceiling in /none/ the previous  room though not exact there are similarities to the way the script is drawn  travis this is one of the ones in the cages right  matt it was in the brazier right there in the center  marisha they tried to burn it  travis hey yasha you feel like knocking the shit out of some of those cages opening them up  ashley i walk over and just start hitting  matt you start bashing and shaking it you bend and eventually tear through some of the cage and  glance through you guys /none/ together begin to inspect the other cages and honestly in there  what you find is ash most everything in this chamber has been destroyed intentionally it  seems either by the previous denizen who lived here that you destroyed or somebody else that  had been here in here before the only things that you find are what was in that burial chamber in  the back and that mostly burned tome in your hand  marisha i walk over to caleb hey caleb found this  liam oh would you like to add it to the pile  /none/ marisha sure i think its got stuff for you in it  liam im not really into smut thats a bit of a ruse  marisha thats unfortunate actually  liam i mean more than normal  marisha sure  liam within reason  travis can i walk to the entrance to the tunnel just to keep an eye out while he does his thing  matt sure make a perception check  taliesin everythings in the pile including the stuff in the second chest  travis 13  sam what stuff in the second chest huh what who huh /dung/  taliesin the stuff in the second chest  liam well she was in a dark hole  taliesin i heard two traps go off  sam of course i was just about to get it out here its for the whole group were a team now right  travis thats very considerate of you nott  taliesin anything you take on your own time is yours were on the clock  sam of course i would never try to steal from the group i just  laura what is it  sam its a bunch of gold and jewels /none/  liam hey you know this is going to take a while so why dont we put it all down and i will  get to work okay  sam im poisoned  laughter  liam how much you care to drink is on you  laura ive got an herbalism kit  matt theres like a purple froth at the corner of her mouth its spitting out  liam shes antiqued too shes covered in ash  marisha covered in oil and ash  laura can i use my herbalism kit to get rid of the poison  matt /none/ go ahead and make a medicine check  liam spitting pah pah  taliesin were not stealthy doing this  laura thats 21  matt okay ill say yes you reduce the duration of the poison from an hour to about ten minutes  in the time it takes for guys to finish up most of the poison eventually begins to wear off you  still look at bit worse for wear  taliesin greener than normal  sam how much money did we get  matt no coins its just jewelry  laura are there any rings  matt /none/ yeah theres probably a good 12 or so rings in there  laura caleb you should see if the rings are magic  liam i am well on my way i hope i have been doing this for a while so step one is detect  magic on the pile to see whats what  matt detect magic on the pile  laura it also includes the sword and the vases  matt correct the only magical essence you get from that pile is the large sword that was taken  off the wall its not a magical aura from /none/ the book you just pulled from there but even your  quick glance at the way that its bound and the construct of it is familiar to you  liam does it also help that im also within the oh no we took a short rest which is an hour  okay good the sword is the one thing  matt the sword is the one thing thats giving off a magical aura  liam okay can i pick up this new book and leaf through it and try to see  matt it is a partially damaged but in /none/ some ways intact spell book  laura can i try doing the mending cantrip on it would that help  liam would you be ever so kind i would be very grateful  laura singing le le le le le  matt holding your symbol and concentrating on it and whispering beneath your breath with a big  smile the pages begin to shift out and form into a full book the half section thats burned is  restored to its previous  exclamations of surprise  matt however the script isnt there it doesnt restore any of the writing /none/ on the inside of the  book unfortunately  laura thats still cool  matt where you get to the pages where it was burned the ink ends at that edge  liam i put my hand on top of yours thank you very much  marisha youve got like a section to take notes now  laura hey thats good  taliesin or fill in the blanks  liam i begin the process of casting identify on the sword oh and the mantle what about the  mantle was that in the pile  matt the mantle is not /none/ magical it looks like it was an ornamental  sam burial shroud  matt more like a ceremonial shroud on the inside of the pocket there is a lot of dried blood on  the inside of it it looks like something was kept in there that at one point was very viscous and  covered in crimson  marisha necromancers  liam the original goth  matt of the book that you find these are the remnants of the interior of it and this is the  sword identified for you  liam okay this sword because i know /none/ youre all dying to know is very old it is a greatsword  would i know the name of it by casting this  matt as part of the identify spell you would know what its called  liam this sword is called the magicians judge  laura whoa  liam excuse me heavy accent the magicians chudge  sam thats his zemnian accent  laura what else does it  liam oh no im absorbing and i will tell you in a moment i need to make sense of it first  laura its a twohanded then because its /none/ a great  liam its a great sword and what this  travis not a good sword  marisha but a great sword  liam as jester its pretty great when someone like yasha hits a baddie with this you  can dispel any magical property that is present yeah or without attacking you can hold the sword  up and do the same  travis oh shit if theyre casting something it breaks it  matt its not a counterspell its a dispel magic you still have to roll to see if it  happens but essentially you  /none/ travis if they had like a hold person up it could dispel it  laura we could use it on notpeople as well maybe on objects  sam magical traps  matt anything within the realm of dispel magic the spell itself  liam big woman this has your name all over it i think  ashley let me try and see if  liam yeah youll have to pick it up i cant even lift this thing  ashley okay  laura laughter thats how you hold a greatsword  ashley whoa  matt the hilt curves at the /none/ tip and comes up at an angle like this like a very subtle v shape  with the scrolling and runes on the edge the blade itself is this wide thick gradually coming  to a point greatsword about five feet long from hilt to edge of blade its practically an anime  sword looking at it and based on what he discovered of the sword itself it was used in the  age of arcanum as an executioners blade to kill mages that were caught by the law and went against  the law of the land it was /dung/ used and probably had been used to execute a number of mages in the past  laura oh its dark is it cursed does it feel cursed  ashley hello  travis laughter  ashley i dont think so  matt caleb as youre recalling the information from the identify sword you recall the notes that  you picked from the book when you entered the chamber that spoke of a bounty hunter that had  come for siff the trophy that was taken  marisha took his legs yeah  sam with the sword  marisha thats why he /none/ had no feetsies  laura so siff didnt have any feet  marisha he actually didnt have feet he lost his legs  taliesin he did have feet they were just somewhere else  matt you get the sense the sword that was in the wall was the trophy taken from that bounty hunter  liam yeah i assumed that immediately before the thing attacked probably siffs legs are all over  you right now  sam oh no ugh gross  laura do you think taking the sword off the wall was what made siff be able to come /none/ back  liam i dont know but it was worth it  laura hmm  marisha hmm i dont know  laura at least were not dead you guys  marisha yeah yeah  sam we have some rings  laura oh we can put them on now theyre not magic  sam well i know we share everything but i feel like the ladies of the group would enjoy them  more maybe we just take them the ladies of the group  travis i dont mind  taliesin im taking a ring how many are there  matt /none/ 12 rings  liam caleb is chewing on his finger and looking through the book  sam we all get one i should get one for finding them  taliesin thats fair  sam i should get one for sharing them that was a good deed  taliesin that was not a good deed that is literally baseline of whats expected  laura i should get an extra one for healing you for poison so thats two for me  sam fjord gave up his ill take his share thats four for me  laura i get calebs because hes /none/ not saying anything thats three for me  sam beau youre naturally beautiful so ill take yours  marisha give me a damn ring  sam damn it  laura how many is that seven eight  taliesin im taking an extra one for helping you remember that youre supposed to share  laura yasha thats two rings left for you  taliesin you can put it in your ear  laura or in your nose  sam oh i have a nose ring im going to swap one out dont look  laura there has to be a hole /none/ in it for you to be able to do that  sam oh fuck i got snot and ash all over it  matt yeah you are a mess right now  marisha beau leans over calebs shoulder what are you reading  liam im thinking of all the good things that i can do for our new collective  marisha yeah thats cool whos the publisher is that first print first edition  liam it is the random old house first edition let me tell you this was a good find everyone  marisha i recognize a few of /none/ those symbols  liam yeah what do they mean  marisha you know magic shit  liam you are correct  travis hes redacting his own card  laura what is he writing  sam oh by the way sidenote everyone out of game laura has been taking our inventory and  keeping it lost the page with all of the  laura no i didnt lose the page i lost the whole spiral  sam we have no idea what we have as a party anymore  travis the idiot goliath kept it for five years  laura yes /none/ well things moved for some reason  liam terrible roleplay  travis are you sure its not on the table  laura does anybody see a little  sam youre looking for it now  laura yeah because i need it  matt while shes looking for that what are you guys doing  travis anything else in the hallway moving  matt you dont see anything else moving no  marisha the gentleman just wanted us to kill shit right  travis yeah just to clear it out  marisha he wanted us to did you find it  /none/ matt she found it  marisha did he want us to bring back something or just clear it out  sam there was something  matt he said clear it out  laura get evidence of something  sam evidence of magic  matt pretty much find out the nature of the place clear it out bring back what you find and  he may let you keep some of the spoils  laura he may let us keep some of the spoils  marisha i thought he said he wanted us to bring the expensive good shit but we /none/ can keep whatever else  matt essentially  liam you know we could give him some of those rings  marisha maybe some of the art  liam ja definitely the art  sam the art yeah the vases  laura i bet theyre worth a lot of money though rich people love old things  marisha they love old things if we say it belonged to a dead person they love it even more  travis plus if you give them all the rings they might give us a job with more fancy stuff next time  sam is /dung/ it just rings matt or were there other things in there  matt there were rings a couple of loose bracelets it was basically a collection of  ornamental jewelry  liam if we skimp hes going to think were bigger assholes than we actually are  taliesin lets keep it all together then for now except for the books  marisha well each take a ring  laura one ring  marisha well each take one ring  laura mine rules them all though  taliesin got to do business  liam you take my ring  sam no /none/ you dont have to all right  laura i already took his ring so technically here  sam you can have fjords ring fjord doesnt want one right  liam give her a ring  laura singing i have two rings now still  marisha maybe we can give him that research notebook we found you keep the spellbook we give  him the research notebook we already know what was in it  liam i gave it a cursory glance i skimmed it  sam well if you read it on the way back youll remember it forever  /none/ liam thats a good point  laura what about the sword  marisha i say we keep the sword  liam no we keep that sword this one with that sword  ashley i like it you know we can i dont know  laura i mean he probably cant even hold a greatsword  travis its pretty obvious youre going to have to hide it if we walk back in there  liam we can put it in the haversack cant we  ashley do you see it  laura its a little big for the haversack  liam /none/ i thought that thing was mary poppins satchel it doesnt go all funny  laura not quite so much its only eight cubic feet  liam while we talk to the gentleman while we navigate that i could carry the thingy to make  room for it  ashley do we all have to go inside to talk to him  travis no i dont think we do  marisha do we have to go back out through the river to get out of here  travis yeah we didnt see any other exits right  matt no the only /none/ way out that you know of is the same way you came in  travis which is weird because it was all caved in  marisha which means were going to have to pass right back through the gentlemans place its not  like were going to be able to lie  travis can you mend the transportation circle  laura i dont think it works quite like that it has to be a broken thing  liam yes and this sort of thing takes a lot of work from very specialized people  marisha i wonder where it goes /none/  sam you could mend the big urn that held the ashes of the lichy thing then we can take that  urn back and give it to  laura as long as there were no ashes in it  sam theyre all on me  matt i will say unfortunately the urn that was destroyed that contained siffs remains is a bit  large for the mend spell you can only mend a footbyfoot space the urn was a big old thing  liam clarification when caleb did detect magic did the circle in the center of the room /none/ glow at  all or is it its dead  matt nope you see its been scarred intentionally from the inside possibly whatever  flurry of intent that siff had to burn the book destroy everything burn everything from the  inside also was to destroy the circle and allow nothing else to come through you get the sense  that the final moments in this chamber were probably very paranoid  marisha what do we remember about the crawling king do you know anything  matt that would be a religion check  liam i will make a religion /none/ check  travis i will make one too but im not going to count it  taliesin advantage or no  matt for you no  liam 15 for caleb  taliesin no thats a one  laura oh it wasnt an herbalism kit im stupid it wasnt an herbalism kit that could heal the  poison it was medicinal herbs thats what i had in my inventory that i remembered  matt oh you rolled pretty well same difference well say it would have lasted a little longer  but you still managed to outlast the poison there was /none/ no threat at that moment whatd you roll  liam 15  matt 15 religion anybody else no  travis i rolled it but  matt what did you roll  travis a 20  marisha did you say you rolled a one  taliesin a one  marisha you rolled a one another one  matt there you go the crawling king is known as what you can recall with a 20 strangely and  the information comes to you esoterically youre not entirely certain where the inspiration for  this knowledge comes from but you have these images /none/ of one of the betrayer gods in history  youve heard stories or something that inspires you to remember something inhuman and larvalike  a monstrous terrible worm crawling through the deepest tunnels of the world now locked away  postcalamity with all the rest of the betrayer gods  liam why do you have such a queer look on your face  travis i feel like i remember something about a real larvalooking worm huge fucking thing  matt and travis screaming human face at the front  liam for the crawling king you are talking about  laura /none/ i definitely start drawing that in my notebook  travis yeah locked away after the calamity but real nasty  liam do you have a lot of knowledge for the gods and religions of the world  travis not really its more like i remember from a dream or something kind of hard to remember if  it happened to me or not  liam the aweinspiring one with the face is from a dream you had  sam was it the saltwater dream  travis no i dont think so could be  sam you need to work on /none/ vivid dreams you can control yourself lucid dreaming yeah  travis how do you do that  sam i dont know i think its crystals or something  laura you can keep a dream journal thats a good way to do it  sam when you wake up you just write  laura write it down immediately what you remember it really helps  liam i would like to do an insight check on fjord while he tells us that story pretty good 20  matt best you can tell hes telling the truth  travis as per usual  /none/ liam whack  marisha well i think this information about the teleportationy circle situation could be useful  leverage if he wants to try and take that sword off of your back  ashley i feel like rich people like candlesticks so i could take the candlesticks with us  travis yeah what are they made of can we tell what kind of metal those candlesticks are made of  liam well nott and i could tell you  matt they look like theyre made out of nice metal theyre not made out platinum or anything  but theyre fine /none/ candle lamps could be a silverlike material  ashley theyre antique you know for decoration  travis fuck yeah man melt that down  ashley theyll probably want those instead of the sword  matt make an intelligence check  marisha i say we keep this teleportation a secret unless he tries to start bargaining for shit  travis natural one  matt another natural one you have a hard time telling what kind of metal this is  laura are we going to tell him about the sword  marisha not unless he asks  travis pretty sure its /none/ aluminum  laura only if he notices the sword  liam you know i think we give him the things of monetary value we are thinking longterm for this  group working together this book and that blade are going to ensure a greater success and cohesion  in the future  marisha thats what were saying  liam then we are as one  laura i can try to fit it in the bag  sam what if it rips i dont think its a good idea  laura if it pierces its bad  liam can we try /none/ to do it but go with the hilt downward see what happens  sam why dont we try to camouflage it we could wrap it in reeds  laura rub some of the ash on it  ashley what if i have you on my shoulders like a kid  sam sure yeah of course thats normally how i like to travel  ashley we put behind us  laura like it can be up your butt  sam how would that work in front of me  ashley its connected to thats not going to work  sam no /none/ i like this i could drape myself over it  liam what all is in that haversack that you have  laura i have some crossbow bolts and this crowbar and the sledgehammer  liam can we take out everything except for  laura i have this longsword i have these old vases that were going to give him i have this  old dodecahedron and i open up the lead box this is really taking up a lot of space  liam caleb starts looking at the do  laura i start shoving it all back in  travis /none/ i forgot we got that  marisha how did you forget we got that  sam oh wait wheres our dynamite didnt we have dynamite i mean boom sticks  laura we have boom sticks  sam yeah dont we have two boom sticks  matt you have two you never used from the fight  sam who has them  marisha i have one i think  sam dont we have drugs  marisha we have mushrooms  liam shouting jester  laura im listening what  liam i know you are but i am cutting through the noise /none/ can we not take everything out of that bag  except for this new blade and the dodecahedron everything else comes out because the rest is  pretty utility is it not  marisha well its eight cubic square feet  laura it might work we can try to fit it  liam yeah we can tie a rag around the end of the blade to keep it from piercing anything  laura yeah does it have a scabbard  matt no it does not it was ornamentally placed on the wall  laura we should probably get one of /none/ those made  sam i dont know about this  liam i pull off the new cloak that i got a handful of days ago we can wrap this around the  blade so it will not pierce  taliesin tie it up and bundle it  liam of course that will work  laura it works it doesnt get pierced from the inside it can only be pierced from the outside right  marisha yeah its magical  matt are you trying to place the blade inside  laura yeah  matt you place it into there it gets /none/ to the hilt and it wont go all the way in  laura its too big  matt you have too much stuff in it  laura what if i take the sledgehammer out ill take the sledgehammer out  liam the sledgehammer we leave its a sledgehammer  laura will it fit once i take the sledgehammer out  liam everything but the dodecahedron  matt the unfortunate thing is its a very long blade in comparison to other points the space  itself is somewhat amorphous but you consider it still a central space  liam what if /none/ roll the sword up like a fruit rollup  laura i dont think the sword is going to fucking fit here  marisha i still like yashas idea  sam lets try yashas idea  marisha just slip it up your back robe  ashley i can slip it up my back and then you can be on my shoulders like youre tired or something  liam wear my cloak if you want to cover it  ashley nott can put her legs out  travis we should probably get back weve been here awhile  laura he probably thinks /none/ were dead you guys  travis well we almost were  marisha all right lets go  travis we head out  liam i hang out at the back of the group for a split second and hold out that wire that i used  to cast that cantrip and look at the room and i look at the wire then i follow everybody  matt okay you guys make your way back up through the chamber where you had the encounter with the  gelatinous cube and solved the riddle of the hidden interior of this research facility you /dung/  make your way through the no longer trapped chambers still tenuously held on the various  pressure plates  laura oh man we should have tried to go through that teleportation circle  liam it was broken  laura yeah we should have tried harder  marisha they worship some weird shit who knows what dark corners of the world it goes to  taliesin i wonder if youll come out in one of the nine hells but only a third of you  liam what we would have done is faceplanted on the stone floor  marisha were /none/ going to start with just trying to give him the rings and the art right rings art  shit keep everything else  laura and marisha and the candlesticks  sam i think the god of gods wants to say something  matt as you guys are having this conversation you continue up the spiral staircase coming to  where the wall had been blown down and then cleared out for you guys to enter there as you  hear the familiar sound of rushing water you climb out back into the much cooler air flow  thats blowing through /none/ the subterranean tunnel there your two boats are still affixed pulled up  onto the edge of the river  liam can i say that as soon as i left this chamber i tagged along behind my new monk best  friend and sent the globules in the air around us even though she has the goggles and im while  walking trying to read every page of that journal and will continue to do so on the boats  laura thank you for saving me molly  taliesin youre welcome  laura thank you for saving me fjord  /none/ travis no problem  matt so whos taking which boat  ashley i would like to get in a boat with caleb  matt yasha and caleb on one side  sam and me  ashley and nott  matt the rest in the other  laura i have to go in the other boat  sam youre the motor  matt are you guys going up back where you came  sam does the river keep going  matt the river continues going yeah it forked ahead where you were  travis current goes away from the direction we /none/ came from  matt correct but its not a strong current its a lazygoing current but you could row up its a  little harder to do  travis we could see whats down the river a bit  liam if we want to go back our two muscle sisters could get us up this current for sure  matt you could it would be tiring  travis were already out this far might as well see where it goes for a little bit  sam it could be scary there could be more rock monsters and things  taliesin /none/ there are literally going to be rock monsters if we go back the other way  liam yeah if we are doing that then i suggest camping in this chamber before going forward  because we are all bloodied and battered you know  travis sure we could do that  laura it has been a really long day so far  sam what time is it  matt make a survival check nott  liam i would know what time of day it is  matt you would because of your feat  sam and so would i because /none/ i rolled an 18  matt the two of you know that in the time you spent traveling down here in the subterranean  area resting and going through these battles and you left midday its when you had arrived to  begin your journey here its getting pretty close to dusk not quite yet the sun hasnt set  sam we could go a little ways and then come back if we dont find anything  liam i dont think we should go we either go back the way we came or we camp before going forward  marisha /none/ we could do a scout boat  laura or we go check out whats farther along  marisha maybe one boat stays behind the other scouts it out  liam im going to stay behind i am out  laura and marisha separate the party  taliesin and travis ill go forward  marisha ill check it out  liam terrible idea  marisha its our boat our boat scouts  laura just a little bit  taliesin not far  marisha i use my staff to help navigate jester  taliesin and sam this is a terrible idea  /none/ matt yasha nott and caleb are staying behind  ashley ill watch over these guys  matt you keep watch the four of you guys  sam ill watch over these guys  ashley okay nott  matt the rest of you get into one of the boats push off catch up onto the current and begin to  lazily drift further down the cavern  laura i feel like this is stupid  sam bye guys  laura see you never  travis well be back were just taking a little look  taliesin were only going an hour /none/ down tops  marisha i light a torch  matt the light picks up and spells out the interior of this chamber  travis keep an eye on the roof remember  laura if the current starts to pick up were going to fight it and try to go back yes  liam as they float away out of earshot i say to my two friends here you know if need be the  mighty drei also sounds very cool  taliesin are we taking a cat  laura yeah oh i dont think it works that far away from /none/ him  liam no frumpkin is scarfing around my neck right now  matt you guys travel for about ten or 15 minutes down before another cavern merges with the one  youre in it looks like another side of the river seems to merge with yours  laura oh thats where the fork was it comes back together  marisha were back to the fork  matt well youre back where the fork seems to remerge with the path youve been taking as you  turn back onto where that happens what do you do  marisha were going /none/ down that other path right  laura yeah keep going straight ahead  matt are you guys continuing to go downriver or are you going  laura were turning back and going the other way  travis we could check out the other cavern and save the deeper part of the river for when were together  taliesin thats fair lets just  travis yeah were fighting up  matt jester turns it around and begins going against the current and pulling you guys up  travis i get behind jester and start massaging her traps  matt there you /none/ go switchback towards the other avenue of the fork and you guys continue up  there it takes a little while longer and its a little tiring for the heck of it make a  constitution check please  laura constitution check thats pretty good 16  matt no sweat youre making it up the river without an issue your muscles are holding its  fine you are a beast  sam you have some sweat right here  matt eventually the sound of rushing water gets louder and louder you glance up in the direction  where youre coming /none/ from and theres a fine mist in the air a spray  laura oh no theres a waterfall  matt it looks like there is a waterfall that you guys are at the bottom of its about a 15foot  drop from above to the bottom of where you are youd have to climb to get to the top and you  have no idea how to get a boat up there you get the sense that if you had gone the other way down  here you wouldve suddenly had a waterfall drop  travis is there land off /none/ to the sides of the bottom of the waterfall  matt very thin a half a foot to a foot but there are a lot of stones and rocks that have  tumbled through the river over time and set at the bottom that wouldve destroyed a boat that had  fallen off the edge of that waterfall  taliesin good to know  laura does it seem like there are any boats that are broken at the bottom of it  matt you can make an investigation check as youre rowing up to the edge glancing over the side /none/  laura is there anywhere to stop the boat  matt this would be more of a perception check because you cant really investigate youre not  poring through it  taliesin ill join this  matt theres no place to pull the boat off to the side  taliesin is there a place to tie it off  matt there are only really the stones here and theyre pretty slick  laura i only rolled a ten  matt you dont see any remnants of broken ship or boat  taliesin perception that would have been ten again  /none/ matt yeah its hard to tell in this vicinity you do see the water crashing down a little so  there are a couple of small platforms on the way that its hitting and splashing off again the  spray is causing all this  laura is the waterfall really hardcore could we see if theres anything behind the waterfall  matt well at the moment no from what you can see in the vicinity you see the water rushing down  marisha can i get a little bit closer i can poke  liam find clarota again  laura /none/ i try to get closer so that she can poke through the waterfall  marisha im going to take my staff and jab it behind there see if theres anything  matt on one end it hits rock does not  gasping  matt theres a little space behind the water  laura should we go  marisha theres always shit behind waterfalls i think we should  laura do you think its going to bludgeon us  taliesin im already taking off my jacket im taking off everything that i dont want to get  wet keeping just one /none/ sword and im going to go for it  liam nipple rings in or out  taliesin weirdly there are no nipple rings those things are dangerous they catch on shit  liam insight check  matt theyre not there  taliesin 16  matt molly jumps off the boat  laura oh youre going youre jumping now  taliesin im going in  laura youre not going to try to get the boat through  travis im not letting him go by himself i do the same thing  laura i try to get the boat through  matt /none/ you row the boat you pull through the waterfall and the boat cracks the opening is  not wide enough for the boat and it jams up into the space and gets lodged and the waterfall is on  you guys and in the boat its filling up the boat  laura i save the boat okay i try to push off and not sink the boat  matt make a strength check  marisha can i help her push off  matt yeah so you have advantage because shes aiding you with this  laura jeez oh much better /none/  matt what did you roll  laura 21  matt 21 yeah thatll do it you push away from the waterfall actually im going to pull up some  audio for this because i have it  laura i really want to go see whats behind the waterfall but i dont want to lose the boat  taliesin im crawling up into it man  laura well lose the boat if i jump out of the boat  marisha will it go anywhere though this is the end of it its stuck in the chamber  taliesin no because /none/ its going to have a flow because the water is coming down we have to tie  it off on something  laura is there anything to tie the boat on  matt there is nothing here unfortunately its slick rocks  laura do you see anything on the other side  taliesin ill let you know when i get there  matt hes swimming making his way through at the moment  taliesin yeah where is it im so excited i want to hear your white noise  sam in cold water  laura itll be like a cold /none/ peppermint drink itll be good  sam i dont think it works like that  laura it does because ive been doing it at home  matt you make your way through  ashley much better  matt there you go keep it thematic you come up from underneath and you can see as soon as you  come up and reach out your feet and your hands both of you guys begin to catch soft river floor  and eventually it comes up to a plateau and this is a small enclosed chamber in the inside  taliesin laughter /none/ ive always wanted to do this  travis darkvision do i see anything  matt it only goes back about ten or so feet  sam clarota voice welcome to my home  matt clarota voice its been a while  liam clarota voice time is a circle  matt hes folding beer cans into little shapes whats an alhoon to do anyway you guys come out  of the water and quickly glance as your hairs drenched on the sides of your face except for  you its short enough hair on the inside its fairly empty except for /none/ a skeleton a humanoid  skeleton against a back wall that is laying there it has manacles or chains attached to its wrists  neck and feet and theyre all connected by a singular chain in the center and its resting  there and its probably been here for a while  travis thats bad luck  taliesin we seem to keep finding these i am going to examine this thing  matt make an investigation check  taliesin seven  matt i mean the bodys pretty rotted it looks like whatever clothing theyre wearing is very  basic material /none/ that is it would be more disintegrated if there wasnt so much moisture in  the area and it looks like bits of it have been eaten away with fungus and mold over time the  manacles are very well made and looking at the edges where they connect theres a small rune at  that point  travis no scratches in the walls or any pouches or compartments on the floor around this little space  matt make an investigation check  travis natural 19  matt glancing around the interior of the chamber unfortunately there are no secret /none/ compartments or  any alcoves it looks like whoever was in here may have been an individual who escaped from a boat  that was unprepared for the fall and whoever was rowing them down this chamber either didnt  survive or didnt know about this hidden alcove and this individual was in here until they passed away  travis what do those manacles look like  taliesin magic  travis oh we could use those ill walk over and i step on the elbow joint and snap it  matt as you do the whole skeleton implodes entirely and /none/ the manacles slip off as the  different joints pull apart and alleviate the manacles now youre holding the center chain so  you have the neck ring the wrist and the ankle rings all dangling from this cluster of chain  youre holding  taliesin i will pick up the skull and take a look at it it is human  matt it appears to be human make a medicine check  taliesin all these checks wheres my medicine there 12  matt looking at the features of the skull theyre a little bit more delicate than an average /none/  humans skull you get the sense they may be of partial elven blood not full elf but partial elf  sam never go full elf  taliesin very true well on your way yorick i set it adrift  travis yep put the manacles over and ill jump back in  taliesin im going to also keep my eyes open im going to try to get a little bit down into this to  see if theres any bits and pieces underwater  travis yeah thats what i was going to say  matt make an investigation check when /none/ you came back in the water  taliesin do a little pat down  travis can i aid him or help him do something  matt sure you guys both go down there you roll twice with advantage then the help action  allows you to  taliesin 18  matt looking down below there you do see at the bottom mostly covered in masses of soft dirt and  silt pieces of broken ship and amongst the jagged rocks it looks like more than one a few  ships have met their end at the base of this waterfall /none/ definitely beyond that you dont  notice anything of use you do find a rusted shortsword and a couple of broken pieces of boxes  but anything that was left at the bottom of the waterfall seems like would have been recovered  anything of worth someone must have come back for and sifted through because everything down there  is rotted wood and things that werent useful  taliesin all right im going to kick my way back up to the boat  matt okay you guys break the surface and climb back into the boat  marisha ugh /none/ gross molly  laura did you find anything

point and you guys begin your evenings long rest could i  have everybody at the table except for fjord /none/ please leave and go take your break a little early  marisha singing more bad dreams  laura

liam its the same show  marisha crack into a kraken  travis take your time its all good  laura sorry i want to bring this with me thats all  travis oh no oh god  matt the sleep takes /dung/ you and the darkness of your dream state alleviates you of the stress of the  day your aching muscles turning numb your physical form and consciousness now removed and  aimless in this dark space you look down at your hands and there you see clasped in your grip the  hooked and curved blade that you had recently bound with in your grasp you swing it and slowly  inspect as you do as you swirl the blade around in your hand it almost has a trail around it as  you hold it coldly in you grasp /none/ this yellow light suddenly emerges in front of you as a familiar  large yellow eye now looks upon you a voice fills you directionless consume you glance at  the blade and back at the eye and the voice again says consume what do you do  travis consume oh god am i going to try to swallow the sword  matt what do you do fjord  travis its a large blade right  matt its about this wide in places it comes out and it arcs and curves and has jagged edges on it  travis i /none/ dont know what you mean consume fuck it ill turn the blade over and keeping my eyes  on the big eye ill bring it up to my mouth and open it  matt its cold to the touch of your tongue the blade completely absent of any temperature  travis ill  matt as you begin to force it down your gullet you feel the edge of the blade hit the back of  your throat and a moment of pain hits you as it begins to cut through your flesh at that point  this ravenous hunger begins /none/ to build on the inside of your stomach though the pain tells you to pull  away you continue to force the blade down as you pull it down from the hilt you feel the blood  burble up in the back of your throat and spill out of your chin but you continue to push it until the  entirety of the blade is consumed within your throat you close your eyes for a moment and look  up at the eye once more the voice returns to fill reverberating around you the pain subsides  and it says /none/ good the eye closes the lid completely cutting of the source the cold the  liquid the water around you the sense of being under the ocean again begins to whisk you away a  heavy current begins to pull from behind and you reach out trying to grasp for any hand or foot  hold yet you have nothing to hold on to as you feel yourself being dragged into this endless  abyss the dream comes to an end you wake up panting everyone else is asleep in the area no  one seems to have woken up /none/ from your presence  travis anything in my hands  matt nothing in your hands no  travis i wipe my mouth  matt wipe your mouth theres a little bit of blood right there across your hand  travis can i try and summon the sword  matt you do and as you summon it there before you is not the wastehunter blade but the falchion  now returned to grasp with a strange more hooked and jagged appearance to it it seems the essence  of this pact has consumed the weapon you had bound with and made /dung/ it one with the falchion you made  this pact with oh so long ago  travis i try and keep my clears throat fu make it disappear again has anybody woken up are  any eyes open at all  matt at the moment no  travis ill lay back down and go to sleep  matt thats where well take our break

 laura sympathetic just on the tusks  sam you had said that you did your own dental work at one point did you do that on purpose  travis yeah i did  sam why  marisha couldnt afford a root canal  /none/ travis that would have been a better excuse when i was younger they used to make fun of my teeth  laura who  travis kids can be cruel so i decided to take away the target that was most easily available for them  liam did you grow up with people who did not have tusks like you so you were different  travis yeah at the time there werent any others like me i feel like i was especially picked on  for my teeth  liam insight check  laughter  sam jesus  marisha my childhood /none/ damage insight check  liam just a ten not great  matt as a note generally you can say do i believe him and ill tell you to make an insight  check its not im going to use an insight check action  sam but insight check is so much dickisher  laura it really is do you still feel the same way about your teeth  travis not necessarily it became a habit  laura you have to continue to do it  travis im sure i dont have to its like people who chew their nails i /none/ guess  ashley they will always grow back even if you  travis they are persistent  liam how quickly do they come back  travis not super fast  laura is that why you have blood on your mouth were you filing your teeth last night  travis no i think i bit my lip  marisha i hate it when that happens  travis yeah right and then you bite it again the next day  taliesin do i believe him  matt you can make an insight check  taliesin one  marisha 800  laura is /none/ that nine  marisha its nine its 1000  laura no way  taliesin im rolling so well  sam did you do any other bod mod to yourself growing up  travis bod mod no i did not  ashley did you kill any of the children that made fun of you  marisha children are assholes  travis no i didnt have that sort of a streak in me then  sam yasha did you kill any of your fellow children growing up  ashley if you have to go to battle if you have a challenge you /none/ kill somebody  taliesin if you kill them then theyre not really your friends are they  sam no  taliesin exactly  travis i was a bit tougher than most of the other kids i felt like i could take the physical  poking but the jeering i  laura the emotional poking was too much  liam this is many years later though i cant imagine that any of us would even blink at tusks  travis you know its not even really that intentional ill find myself picking at them  every once in a while  /none/ ashley do you ever want them to stay there  travis like to grow back  liam and ashley yeah  travis yeah there are times ive seen them other half orcs with the teeth  laura the guy in tusk love had them  travis he did yeah i feel like its a trait that exemplifies the rougher side of my race so  sometimes i wish i had them and sometimes im glad i dont  liam yeah well you know for many of us our early days are always with us i understand  sam this is /none/ how you see yourself right  travis i think its how id like to see myself  marisha i mean its how we see you  laura i think you would look fine either way fjord  marisha yeah i mean were too distracted with our own personal damage  travis you saying i should let them grow out  laura im saying if you want to you would look good that way as well you look good this way you  would look good that way  liam cosigned  travis all right fair how about you see me /none/ picking at them or chipping at them or any of  that shit you just say the word and ill stop  laura and travis okay  matt the wind blows through the distant tunnels above and for a minute you all shiver as the cold  wind finds its way down below except for you youre fine  laura im good warm blooded  sam should we go back to the gentleman  taliesin its probably time  liam so cloak on your back sword on the cloak  laura nott on the sword  sam yeah but we /none/ dont have to do that now we have a whole boat trip to go  laura singing sword up the butt  sam no  laura singing yep straight up  sam absolutely not  laura singing just like a puppet  sam no  ashley is this a bad should i stay outside or something  liam there is no we are going on we are going right through their territory  laura if he notices it then he notices it if he doesnt then he doesnt  marisha then we bribe him with the information on the teleportation /none/ circle  ashley or he can challenge me and i can you know  liam we are a very convincing group i think we can talk our way through that  laura im really good at lying  liam you have your ways well the morning is getting on shall we  laura lets get in the boats  liam hans and franz will you please muscle us up this stream  matt are you guys taking the same boat arrangements  marisha sure  ashley hans and franz  matt the two of you are helming it you know /none/ the time of day even though you are below the  surface keeping tracking of this because of your feat its roughly six in the morning its very  early because you guys went to bed fairly early you guys begin to make your way up the river now  going against the current muscling your way up and up further and further still you come across  the area where you had the initial confrontation with the darkmantles and begin to push and push  laura harder because therere things there  matt make a strength check both of /none/ you guys  travis yeah eyes on the ceiling as well because thats where danger came from  laura yeah eyes on the side where the rock guys were  marisha yeah  laura oh no  marisha oh shit  ashley i got 20 not a natural  laura she rolled well this a strength check  matt yes  laura five  matt all right as you guys continue to go forward yasha pushes on manages to gain ground  jester while doing fine yesterday trying to do the advanced pushes youre still making it up the  /none/ stream but youre still a little sore from the night before  marisha she did rowing yesterday  matt yeah however youre not making any loud noises at the moment as you glance up none of  the darkmantles you look up and you can see now there are a few that are adhered to the ceiling  but they dont seem to have noticed your presence yet as youre rowing through youre falling  behind you manage to get through unnoticed and actually way above the one boat i need all the  rest of you to make stealth /none/ checks shes not on your boat which would be jester beau molly  laura oh blessing of the trickster sure on you  liam it feels so weird still with stealth checks to only be able to add a one when i used  to add 9000  matt i know  liam still feels weird  laura you get advantage  travis hey thats way better thank you a 17  marisha 24  laura 12  taliesin 21  laura to be fair i am rowing  matt as you begin to row past to continue quiet as /none/ you can and with sound of the oars it matches  the slow its a little bit of volume based on the river flow but it doesnt seem to cause  enough of a ruckus to draw the attention of the darkmantles above and the two earthenbased stone  and vine creatures that you had originally seen emerge dont seem to notice your presence as you  slowly make your way past this part of the tunnel eventually catching up or at least a little bit  behind yasha and their group as you continue forward i need both of /none/ the boat rowers to make a  constitution check please  travis boat rowers  liam are we past those statues  laura exaggerated southern accent im rowing a boat  liam slowly by  laura exaggerated southern accent thats a 13  matt yasha constitution check please  ashley uh oh  liam dont you have the heart of an ox  ashley a seven  matt a seven you gain a point of exhaustion going against the stream in itself and pushing up  and with the extended push of your muscles to get through that last bit /none/ its beginning to take its  toll on you and your muscles being to seize up  laura its because you went so fast through the other area you have to pace yourself  matt you gain a point of exhaustion with that last bit you guys manage to make your way up the  rest of this underground river it takes a little while but eventually you see ahead the dull green  glow of the various small lanterns that were affixed to the interior of the river cavern  entrance and there you can see the docks on /none/ the side as you approach waiting for you sitting in  the same position up there that older crustylooking fella named rodel who you had met  on the way out and kara leaning against the back wall  marisha oh shit  matt looks like shes asleep in the corner sitting in a small chair and not  travis whistles  matt oh oh youve returned rodel he wakes up grunts they eventually get over there and  help you get the boats over there they tie off the ropes and you guys make your way up out of /none/ the  water out of the boats and onto the dockside she goes youve returned i see that you arent  any worse for wear how did it go  laura we killed stuff we are really badass  travis yeah it was not really much of a test for us  taliesin there was a lot in there though  travis thats true  marisha so many undead blobs lot of undead blobs  matt fair enough well lets get you back there and talk to the boss if hes awake he should  be she pulls out the /none/ blindfolds again passes them out  travis can we just forego those i feel like this is going to be the beginning of a very  fruitful relationship surely  matt i understand that but this is the bosss orders im sorry  marisha the boss is still asleep you said  laura no she said he was probably awake  matt i dont think you understand its the bosss orders i cant just go against them  marisha all right lets go be blindfolded  liam we dont want to rock the boat here by all means  matt /none/ thank you please she passes out blindfolds to you guys you figure out an order of  making your way down and as you made your way to this portion of the cavern you walk back being  lead by kara through the underworks  liam do i see anything of note through frumpkins eyes as we walk  matt same path as you went last time not as busy nobody else is walking through the halls  its early enough where there isnt much you do come past that chamber before where you saw the  cages in there /dung/ and theres two more cages set inside even larger one of them is a heavy meshed  series of metal you dont hear anything in there  liam can i tell whats inside there  matt make a perception check for frumpkin  liam come on frumpkin  matt with disadvantage  liam doesnt matter  marisha thats pretty bad  liam pretty bad yeah both bad real low five  matt you do not unfortunately its too dark in the distance at this point its too late  eventually making your way up through a series of steps to /none/ a ladder and then you all can take your  blindfolds off you recall being led down to this chamber at this point kara says were almost  there she climbs up the ladder and opens a trap door that leads into a small chamber you guys  follow her up inside a storage room where there are sacks of food and barrels of all sorts of  alcohol ale water and whatever else materials are being kept down here going through a door not  but two feet from that open hatch into the familiar interior of the true /tavern/ evening nip tavern  sam before we go in im going to try to tug on yashas leg dont you want to carry me my legs  are a little achy  ashley oh yes  marisha by the scruff  travis right up the butt  sam ah i try to find a position  ashley try to settle the cloak to  matt did you leave your moon sword behind or do you still have it with you  ashley i still have it with me was i supposed to leave it behind  matt no its up /none/ to you meaning if you have the sword that you had in the sheath that the moon  sword was in right now or at least tucked in there briefly because its a little wider than the  sword you had previously had so its going to carve through itll hold it but the scabbards probably  ashley i want to keep it so maybe we can sell the moontouched sword could we have put it in the  taliesin we could have strapped them both to your back  laura well the moontouched sword is it small enough to /tavern/ fit in the bag or is it  matt barely just barely id say you can probably get that in there  ashley sorry i totally forgot about that  matt just making sure we knew about that as you enter the chamber the light is lower it looks  like only three of the interior torches are currently glowing there is no barkeep at the bar  and there are no patrons in there the ogre guard is there in the corner looks a little  groggy and recently come to consciousness and is feasting on a whole side /none/ of pig that has been  cured and salted it hasnt been butchered literally tearing off the bone of the half of the  pig and sees you enter and grunts and continues eating on the balcony across the way as soon as  you enter you can see at the top there is the female goliath sorah who is standing there and  looking down at you as you enter and gives a head nod of acknowledgement kara goes sorry sorah  is the gentleman awake theyve returned like to talk to him please sorah turns around and pulls /none/  open you can look behind now what little bit of light there is a drawn heavy curtain that blocks  the interior behind and goes boss the nein have returned some voices on the inside and a  voice goes ah just a moment im sorry got some business then coming out from behind the  curtain you see the gentleman in this long deep purple silk robe that is tied around the waist and  goes laughter well youve returned  laura fake wolf whistles  matt indeed well have a seat please  claps loudly some food /none/ please  sam well stand  ashley just lean up against the wall while  marisha bacon i want bacon  matt bacon please get these friends some bacon my god ill be right down he goes back  into the chamber you hear some other voices and a slight giggle and then sorah enters the chamber  after him a few moments pass and then one of the doors on the bottom area opens up and sorah steps  out holds the door aside and the gentleman whos still in his robe but now has pants and boots on /none/  enters the chamber and goes laughter well early risers im not going to lie we were sad to  see you not return sooner and had assumed that perhaps you had not survived so this is a great  gracious celebration of your return he goes and sits down behind his usual chair  travis apologies for our poor timing hopefully we werent interrupting  laura early in the morning  matt what was having breakfast anyway youre alive a little worse for wear i see some scuffs  around the edges tell me all about it what did /none/ you do  travis really not that big of a deal there were some willowisps some floating spirits  taliesin quite a few willowisps  laura yeah so many willowisps did you know you just have to break a vase and you kill a willowisp  matt i did not but good to know  marisha theres like ash all over the place now sorry about that  taliesin quite a few traps  matt right  taliesin was there a gelatinous cube at one point  travis there was actually yes  laura yeah this big cube came down /none/ from the ceiling and it tried to eat us  matt thats terrifying  travis indeed  laura its pretty scary  travis good thing you sent the pros amateurs probably would have had a worse time  marisha found lots of skeletons along the way  travis and marisha yeah  sam and exactly six rings for you  matt make a deception check  laughter  travis you are not scanlan anymore  laughter  sam nine  matt chuckles really  taliesin i smack her on the back of the head  sam you cant reach  /none/ taliesin thats right youre up i swat  travis there was a fair amount of jewelry there was  marisha we also found a decent amount of fine art for you  laura oh yes i pull out the vases look at these antiques  matt he pulls one out inspects it  laura careful theyre very old  matt of course im a collector myself its fine this is beautiful make this is  predivergence as well chuckles  laura i bet theyre worth a whole of money then huh  matt oh most certainly to the right people /dung/ they can be worth quite a bit  laura we found some candlesticks too  ashley also some candlesticks  matt all right you produce the candelabra these six rings you say  laura it was seven i give one of the extra rings  matt make a deception check  marisha come on jester  ashley i didnt keep mine  laura yeah i know  travis look we know who has them we know  laura 16  matt he goes well thank you for your honesty anything else he gives a very intense look  across each /none/ of your faces you would like to inform me that you found encountered any  warnings were going back in after there to clear out whatever remains behind so we want to make  sure were prepared  laura i think we killed everything  liam no you dont want to get pantsed we did not kill everything entirely there are some  critters on the roof of the river passage nothing major you just want to have your eyes on the  ceiling as you go through  matt of course we know of that  laura we see /none/ two rock creatures that were really big but theyre really slow so bolt on past them  and they wont be able to catch you  matt right but within this facility itself  travis there was a destroyed looks like a transportation circle inside  liam yes to be honest it looks like it was possibly looted some time long ago  marisha there wasnt a lot left  liam whatever has inhabited the place in recent years or in recent centuries has been removed  laura there were a lot of burned books  travis bodies lots of /none/ bodies  sam traps which i deftly dismantled  laura mostly be careful walking on them youll see them  sam pressure plates in the lower floor  laura theyre pretty obvious now  matt at this point food begins to be brought from the far kitchen you can see the person who  had just woken up has been rushing to make whatever meats are available and has been cooking  the smell begins to permeate and its coming out piecemeal as theyre ready  taliesin once weve figured out that the willowisps were coming from pots we just /none/ broke  anything that looked like it might contain one  matt all right is that all i would like to specify that i despise falsehood and our  relationship is based on honesty and trust  laura well there were two paths in the river and the second path lead to a waterfall i dont  know what was at the top of the waterfall there could be a chamber up there i dont know the  other side lead to the thing  taliesin a lot of images on the wall weird magic stuff  marisha oh there /none/ was this floor with this relief in it of these two faces and fjord put some coins  in it it opened up and he collapsed and fell in a pit it was super fun  matt what was in the pit  travis a lot of bodies  matt anything else  ashley probably the two leftover coins that he put in the eyeballs are still there  travis four because there were two pairs  laura is there anything else  sam nope  laura were the worst  taliesin possibly a probing question would remind some things /none/ im trying to remember it was a bit daunting  travis yeah so tired  matt so there was nothing else  marisha no we stayed up all night trying to get back here  laura we almost died  matt is that all you found and recovered  laura mumbling i could look in my bag  matt hes done business before and is looking very intently across all of your faces  travis i start eating  matt youre dodging my question that doesnt make me comfortable that doesnt make me trust you  marisha theres just no /none/ answer further  matt youre telling me thats all you found  ashley what were you looking for anyway  matt nothing i wish to be informed that that is the end of your recovery  marisha you knew going in here it was heavily looted and raided we brought you several pieces  matt im going to go out on a limb

goes go on  and they both get up and leave up the stairs he goes ive now initiated my means of getting you  folks and most likely dolan off the hook for the murder of the highrichter it may take some time  a day or two maybe more but have some faith in my abilities just lay low for a few days if /none/ you  dont mind  laura were really good at that  taliesin well do our humble best  marisha will

my bacon to caleb here you go  liam but less you need the protein  ashley do you still keep the blood vials that you  matt oh yes of course we keep those for anyone we do business with sure standard procedure im sorry  ashley yeah okay  sam its fine /tavern/ yasha after all i have an empty vial with his saliva in it so we have that too  matt he just stares  travis thank you for your consideration and time well be in touch shall we  matt of course be safe finishes his meal glaring at nott on your way out as you guys exit  the bottom of the evening nip up into the proper top of the tavern you step out looking out you  can see the morning sun has risen its still early morning at this point in time its probably  eight /none/ oclock in the morning at this point  sam and laura what a day  marisha that was awesome  laura we have stuff to sell  taliesin lets go pawn some things  laura should we go do that now or should we lay low for a little bit and make sure that he doesnt  have anyone following us  travis he can follow us thats fine  laura lets go back to the leaky tap  liam help me remember dm did we have a way to get in contact with dolan  matt dolan was left /none/ at his home thats the last you saw just him at his home  travis thats right you sure you dont want to sell off any of your extra wares  taliesin lets clear some things out  laura we do have some rings to sell i guess if we wanted to  marisha we have those chains we could  laura did you ever look at those chains did you look at the mantacles  liam what mantacles  laura the mantacles to see if they were magical  liam this is the first i am hearing of the /town/ manacles  taliesin we didnt actually tell him about the manacles  marisha we found a dead guy in chains  taliesin a very dead guy  marisha do you think that people are going to start being suspicious of us if we keep selling  magical manacles  laura we should probably stop going to  marisha the same blacksmith  laura maybe not to pumat sol for a little bit  liam maybe pumat has a competitor in a town this big  laura im sure  liam why dont we wait until were back at the leaky /town/ tap before i look at these manacles you  have i would if possible like to swing past dolans house if thats okay  travis sure  taliesin i dont see why not  travis put him at ease  marisha let him know that horris is out of town  liam yeah and before he died he gave me something that i think dolan would want to have  ulog before ulog died  travis oh yeah of course head back that way  sam as we get clear of the bar popping im going to get down off /dung/ of yasha  laughter  taliesin youve been waiting for that for too long  ashley its very strange how youre very dense  sam its all muscle  ashley i feel its a lot heavier than you look  sam im a cool 45 pounds yo  laura you should probably take a bath  sam yes i guess so  laura nott i know you dont like water but this is an extreme version  sam maybe i could wipe myself clean with a dry towel  laura i think probably at least a damp towel  liam /town/ this is surprising coming from me but i agree with that sentiment you are covered in dead person  taliesin several  marisha several dead people  taliesin specifically their feet  sam okay ill think about it  matt as you guys begin to walk along the streets of zadash here in the morning air the cloud cover  in the sky still gray sunless cool you can see the mist of the town is now finally burning off  but the gray day is still cool and welcoming youre going to dolans house you make your way  /none/ towards dolans trying to still dodge too much attention from the crownsguard which  thankfully  marisha especially molly and i  matt not too strong at this point they still are trying to prevent people from entering and  exiting but there are still patrols that go through you make your way carefully through this  point in the morning towards the exterior of dolans hut  marisha as were walking i lean over to fjord and i go somethings been bothering me the  gentleman said that it was ulog that arranged and leaked the information to the /none/ xhorhasian  assassins what would be his motive for doing that if he only really cared about getting his  wife free or at least revenge for his wife  travis i think he was trying to upset the government right create fractures hope pressure  would make things snap in the end  marisha i hope so feels like a big task for one person how would he have those connections  travis maybe hes been hedging his bets for a while good to keep in mind  marisha yeah  matt you guys come up to the exterior /dung/ of dolans home its dark on the inside  travis id normally but i feel like he knows you  liam you come with me because youve spoken to him more than i have  travis walk up double tap followed by a single  matt a moment passes and the door lock clicks creak dolans head peeks out gentlemen its  good to see you what news have you  liam only a moment of your time im a little embarrassed that i did not remember this the other  day but it was quite an evening that night /none/  matt of course  liam when ulog was in that house he found something that i think you should have shortly  before he expired he shoved it into my hand i pull out those papers that he found about the  wife its a little frayed he shoved it into my hand we are lucky that it did not burn up but  take this please  matt of course ill see what i can do things are a bit tense right now of course  liam when it makes sense  matt of course how is horris /none/  travis safe  liam on his way  matt oh thank god  travis to berleben  matt to berleben thats far enough away i think from any influence here thank you thank  you so much  travis of course it was the least we can do we trust with this information and the right things  occurring in the next few days you can find your way to some prosperous moves for this city  matt i hope so  laim a lot of bad things are happening now it would be nice if one good thing /none/ could come of it all  matt that would be id like to see a turn for the right in this city or another at least  there is right in this city there are good people as terrible as the death of the  highrichter may be in essence i think much good may come out of it in the long run  liam its entirely up to you now isnt it  matt we shall see anyway you musnt be seen dilly dallying along at this home just in case  thank you for the update thank you /town/ for horris and good luck friends i do hope we meet again  soon in better times  liam tschüß  matt closes the door locks it behind  travis nice  liam broken clock twice a day come on  matt are you guys heading back to the leaky tap  liam yeah  matt okay as you head back to the leaky tap people are starting to come to consciousness and  exit the building the street becomes a little more bustling one of the barkers one of the town  criers that you had seen before when /town/ you arrived begins coming down the street and begins doing  his shouts harvest close comes on the third of fessuran harvest close comes on the third of  fessuran and continues walking past  marisha we could enter in a contest and fight for the harvest festival right  laura oh yeah there was something about that  travis really just for sport  marisha yeah maybe theres prize money or something  travis that could be a nice change of pace  marisha i like fighting people for fun  matt you get closer to the leaky tap /town/ and see another female  laura yeah in the victory pit  marisha yeah thats it  matt another town crier comes by younger female with the big tabard and the scroll as she walks by  says conflict at the xhorhasian border grows violent watch your children at night  marisha singing hide your kids hide your wife  matt conflict at the xhorhasian border grows violent watch your children at night she  continues walking  laura what happened to the children  matt she looks back at you im just reading the paper  ashley may i /none/ have one of those  matt its for me to read from i have one no  ashley im going to look at it and then im going to give it back to you does it say any more  matt on this it has the xhorhasian note and it has the harvest close coming the third of  fessuran those are the two notes of the day  ashley you literally just thats all thats on there  matt thats my job  marisha hey  matt

night  matt with advantage  marisha with advantage  liam marisha your theme with children continues  marisha and travis she is not a child  marisha what am i doing intimidation 14 she is not a child  matt stammering  marisha theres a rec center community service  matt no at the victory pit its in the pentamarket probably i dont know  marisha thanks its /town/ all you had to tell me  marisha she takes the paper from yasha and darts off down the street  taliesin shes not a verbal learner  marisha i liked her  taliesin i could tell  laura i start yelling out the third of the fessuran is the end of the harvest  sam do we know what day it is today  laura hide your kids hide your wife  matt the third of fessuran is about five days away  laura theres a victory pit  liam passion pit on the third of fessuran  matt /none/ you guys return to the leaky tap and well say for the time being were going to have a few  days of downtime if theres anything specifically you want to do thats not storycentric  liam i need money he said out of character  marisha sell shit sign up for the victory pit  matt all right what are you selling  laura i have a lot of rings i should see if i can get any good money for some of them  marisha pawn the rings that we have  taliesin unless theres an opal in /none/ there im getting rid of the ring  matt none of the rings have gems theyre all base metals like gold and silver  laura i have some fancier rings though from before  matt if you want to try and hock some sure  laura that were stolen from your boss  taliesin oh thats fine theyre probably fake then  matt they are  taliesin anything you took from the circus was not real  ashley wasnt the gentleman supposed to reward us  taliesin it was trade  marisha us not getting charged for murder was the /none/ reward  travis while theyre figuring it out on one of the days can i make my way by ren sutans  physicians office  matt you can do that what do you want to do at rens  travis i want to casually look on the outside see if its still in business see if its still  bustling or if anything has come their way  matt okay you spend a little bit of time watching its still a functional physicians  practice people still need a physician you cant tell from a distance if its darkened by /dung/ the  arrest of lord sutan but you cant imagine its gone well within the family house its still a  functional facility its still one of the finer places to go for medical purposes  travis can i use my mask of many faces and ill adopt an older face with a gray beard and a dark  hood and can i walk into the physicians office  matt yeah easily enough you walk into the main area and one of the clerks there with the same  white robes approaches can i help you sir  travis as /none/ sean connery yes hello  laughter  taliesin commit to it  travis as sean connery is ren sutan there  laughter  matt what do you require of the doctor  travis as sean connery just get him  matt make a deception check  travis nine  matt he goes im sorry to bother you there sir but hes not in at the moment but we have a  few of the clerks that could help you  travis sean connery voice peters out you dont want his trouble with the myriad to spill over to  you /town/ do you  matt his eyes go wide we have no business  travis fetch him now  laura what happened to sean connery  travis i fucking lost it  sam as sean connery fetch him now im a russian sub commander  matt very well ill go fetch him he walks past you out of the  travis as sean connery do your best losers always whine about their best  matt he walks around you and exits the front of the facility and begins walking down the road out  of sight  travis ill turn and /none/ follow him  matt make a perception check  liam as sean connery i cast hexblade  travis 17  matt okay beelining straight to the nearest crownsguard  travis i will turn on my heel and use my mask of many faces to turn into a lovely woman  matt a moment later two crownsguard come rushing blades drawn behind the clerk whos  pointing towards the front of the building and they rush past you in the interior and begin to  look around they both split on the inside and begin going through the different rooms it /none/ seems  not only did he not believe you but dropping the name of the myriad in a public space like that  thats immediate call to the guard for these guys  travis i make my way back to the leaky tap  marisha wow thats good to know  laura i want to scout out the hearth of the allhammer the ravens den in the graveyard and  the platinum house and see if theres a lot of guards or if theres any of those that dont have  a lot of guards  matt for the most /none/ part the places of worship theyre not very prominent theyre not huge  temples theyre kept here out of law that was decided upon but theyre nice they usually have  a handful of crownsguard stationed to each but its not like theyre under intense watch there  arent a lot of worshipers during certain times of the day  laura is there any one that seems emptier than other ones  matt of all of them i would say it would be the ravens den which is at the ossuary gates which  is the large vast graveyard of /none/ most of the higherranked families of this city the matron of  ravens temple is the one thats least attended largely because dealing with death its not as  bright and welcoming to the common folk  laura could i try to get in there when nobodys in there  matt okay you wait for a while and see a moment where it is relatively calm the outside of the  shrine is this iron obsidian archway that stretches up about 20 feet to frame a small  shrine topped with a statue of the matron and her ravens about /none/ her this circle of ravens that  curves around you see the female figure standing in stone the sculpture of the porcelain face  the only material thats not the same as the darkened stone around her its a white porcelain  mask that is affixed to the front of the statue at the base of it you can see a number of bowls  and offerings that have been left around from people that have come and passed through beyond  that there is a door to the small shrine behind it its this small structure maybe 20 feet /dung/ by  ten feet its not a very large shrine youve seen groups of people that function as morticians  in long dark robes and dark clothing that have entered and exited this facility you wait for a  while as there is one body thats being interred at a family plot and then as they all begin to  scatter you see a few other leave and at that moment the interior from what you can tell is  empty or at least youve watched three individuals leave  laura can i get in my disguise kit and affix /none/ a mustache onto her porcelain mask and put a wig on  her and then write across the bottom of it the traveler was here and leave a pamphlet  matt you can certainly try  laura i want to see as much as i can do in that amount of time before anybody comes back  matt sleight of hand for the mustache  laura oh no off to a good start nine  matt as you leap up onto the statue and go to affix the mustache to it a voice over by the  shrine says excuse /dung/ me excuse me  laura oh hello yes  matt you see a pale young man short blonde hair emerge with a similar dark robe that you didnt  see in the inside of the shrine he goes could you please youre not allowed to climb the statue  laura there was a smudge on her face and i know that the people get really pissed when theres  stuff on their statues i was trying to clean it off for you  matt i appreciate that well thank you its just considered  laura i rub my arm across /none/ it to try and clean it off  matt thank you so much  laura i think i got it though dont worry  matt i appreciate that  laura im going to sit here and worship her now thats all  matt please do please i can pray with you if youd like  laura oh thatd be great  matt he sits down next to you and you both silently sit there on your knees and begin to  pray quietly up to the queen you watch as one raven looks down over you both soon as he /none/ looks  up and finishes his prayer he extends his hand for a moment and it takes off  laura does that always happen when you pray to this lady  matt not often but perhaps she smiles upon you  laura she does i know she does because she likes me so much because i worship her real good  matt all right well have a good day he gets up  laura you too  matt at this point the rest of the funeral procession is now returning to the shrine  laura shit damn it is there /none/ anything to tuck a pamphlet into  matt oh yeah you can tuck it under any of the various offering bowls  laura yeah ill do that at least  taliesin theres literally a cadaver that just went into the building not to give you ideas  matt now you know perhaps another time you can come by and try it again  laura yes im going to try some other time  matt anything else you wish to do over the next few days  taliesin i would like to try some chemical altered states  sam oh god /none/  taliesin its time to have a good night  marisha wait is this with the shrooms  taliesin yeah  sam just you alone  marisha wait what night are you doing this  taliesin probably the celebratory first night  travis what time are you starting  taliesin oh just before dusk  marisha ill join you  liam what is the nature of the goods that you have  taliesin i have no idea  matt sam and laura skein  marisha no we bought those magic mushrooms  matt no its a fungal powder  travis /none/ hey caleb you want to take a look at the pouch  matt skein ive heard many arguments over the pronunciation  sam its a real thing you didnt make it up  matt no the word is a real thing its a weaving term  liam if i take a look at this skein can i take a guess at what kind of illicit material im looking at  matt its a fungus make a medicine check  liam yeah i have bad experience with fungus  laura i can do a medicine check do you want me to /dung/ look at it  liam medicine you say that is a 13  matt it looks to be a fungus of some sort with a property to it  liam yeah i dont have good association with that you take that back  taliesin theres only enough for two other people to take it  marisha well i have mine then you bought some too right  travis im holding it in my fucking hand dont you see it  marisha wait how much is that  ashley no you guys go  travis im not going to take it /dung/ i was letting you know im bought it  ashley oh well here i always partake what  laura i mean we could poison somebody later that would be

keep us out of trouble  marisha yasha  ashley well theres something i need to go do you guys get started and ill  marisha shouting oh no yasha you /none/ always do this no  laughter  taliesin somehow she knows you you always do this  marisha bullshit  ashley i know but you know i always take it and i never feel anything  laughter  marisha shouting where do you go yasha  taliesin im excited  matt the two of you that have ingested the skein ten minutes pass and the edges of your  vision begin to cloud and as you sit for a moment your body begins to feel a bit weird nausea  creeps in a bit then a very faint snow of /none/ dust in your vicinity begins to coat you know the  upside down where theres that weird material floating around  laura like legend  matt a little bit only for about ten feet out to you its a ten foot area around you and the  coloration of your vision in this area becomes a gray colorless black white and gray tone i  need you both to make a wisdom saving throw  taliesin oh yeah  marisha shouting this sucks  laura can i look at the stuff  travis yeah here  taliesin a wisdom saving /none/ throw 15  matt 15 okay  marisha im going to say dont fuck me gil oh okay just a wisdom saving throw 17  matt the effects of it you resist the hour long stun it would have held you in as it is not a  healthy thing to ingest under any circumstances it is a very dangerous substance for the  duration the two of you can see into the ethereal plane out to ten feet  taliesin im going walking  laura wait what  taliesin who wants to go to a cemetery right now  /none/ sam wait it takes them to the ethereal plane  matt they can see into the ethereal plane out to a range of ten feet  taliesin im going to put on my least interesting cloak and im going to go find myself a cemetery  marisha i flip my blue cloak inside out to the brown side  travis i dont know where theyre going but i think we got to babysit them  liam distorted how do you guys feel  ashley how do you feel do you see anything is it interesting  marisha i think it /none/ sucks  taliesin were going to work on it though  travis are you guys going on a walk  matt its not quite like that  marisha you can see really cool things  matt as this happens this translucent piranhafaced serpent scoots by this ghastly  looking angler fish creature like gasping breathing  liam hey steve  taliesin im going for a walk  marisha molly how long does this last  taliesin i have no idea  marisha fuck this is it this is the rest of our lives  liam are we saying this is /none/ night one of a couple of days of piddling around  marisha i thought that this was the first night and this was our celebratory night  matt yeah this is more of a downtime period so im trying to get through events  talisen im grabbing a little drink downstairs and then im going to go walk in whatever  direction seems the most interesting shit outside is in  marisha i join molly  travis im babysitting them  laura im going to follow behind and throw pebbles at them from behind  matt in the best interest /none/ of keeping a low profile for the next few days you both wander out  into the city streets altered on  marisha in our hoods and our boring cloaks  matt as you guys begin to wander through the interstead sprawl once again the strange shapes  pass through your peripheral you occasionally hear this chattering and distant chuckling this  weird alien laughter there seems like drifting spiritual energy that freezes your blood as you  pass by its a really uncomfortable sensation for about an hour or so you wander in this space  at the end /none/ of the hour i need both of you to make a constitution saving throw  laura oh no  travis glad i got another pouch of this stuff could come in handy  taliesin this could come in handy  marisha just a saving throw  taliesin 18  liam yeah  marisha 20  matt you feel your body begin to grow woozy and for a second you feel like youre about to  black out and pass out but you catch yourself and the sensation passes your vision returns to  normal and it has run its course /none/ you didnt discern or learn much and you feel exhausted  your body is pretty strained by the process  taliesin drink and a bathhouse  marisha ive got such cottonmouth  taliesin you know what just occurred to me i didnt have a childhood ive never said that out  loud to someone before  marisha mmm what happens if you have a childhood but its barely a childhood because it  was supposed to be someone elses childhood but it was you instead is that a childhood  taliesin what happened to you  laura were following behind /none/ you guys right here  travis lets get you to a bathhouse you were eating dirt about ten minutes ago said it was snow  marisha is that why i have cotton mouth ah goddamn it  travis yeah you got a big mud goatee  taliesin im so proud of you you did so well  marisha well i saw this goatman and he told me just dont eat the yellow snow and youd be okay  matt you get the essence being one whos in tune with your body and you as well that this is  definitely /none/ not a safe substance  marisha this is definitely not a safe substance  matt it may have with the right scenario some situationally beneficial properties  marisha i still have half a dose i think it would be real funny to plant it on somebody and  get them busted later  travis was it a powder or was it like crumbles  matt its like a crumbled dry almost a spongy  laura you guys looked like idiots just so you know  travis shall we get you cleaned up  laura we need to get nott cleaned /none/ up

gathering information maybe its the  ashley its how i talk to people  /town/ matt shouting tell me what you know  ashley deep voice hey conflict xhorhas tell me  matt you dont glean a lot of details most folks tend to steer clear and walk to the other side of  the road when they see you coming what you do get to hear is that amongst the ashkeeper peaks the  mountains that largely border the south and eastern side of the empire to the north there is  that break thats where the ashguard garrison is and the rockguard garrison thats where most of  the battle takes place thats /none/ the protection border that the empire holds to keep the  xhorhasian hordes and creatures from the waste to wander in although many still filter through the  mountains and such apparently theres been rising conflict out there  ashley to the north  matt assaults on the garrisons yeah northeast of where you are further east more east little  bit north you have a map you can look you guys bought a map  laura hey you want to see this map youre not with me  liam this is an entire three day weekend  matt yeah /none/ this is throughout a week so if you wanted to pull the map out  liam pull it out  matt i dont know

 liam no not as fun  marisha blood flow shes fine  liam yeah shes got to walk  marisha shes pregnant shes not dead  matt correct the conflict has /town/ been more common theres been assaults on the garrison it seems  similar to what you heard wandering through the street before there have been more whispers of  children being stolen in the night from homesteads close to the border  laura whispering hide yo kids  marisha whispering hide yo wives  laura i found the map you guys i had it somewhere safe  matt to the east you can see the garrisons and the gap that leads to the xhorhasian side  laura this is the xhorhas side  taliesin oh yeah look at that i /none/ dont think ive ever been there before  ashley theres the ashkeep  laura ooh the brokenveil bluffs look scary  matt anything

give you money but first im going to cast disguise self and turn myself into  looking just like a normal halfling little girl and spend an hour at a /none/ cafe just having lunch and  being a normal person  laura and liam aww  sam then after that im going to go and is there any place if i investigate for a while is  there any place or service or person or anything that can send a package long distance  safely money being no object  matt there are a few facilities in which there is a parcel system that travels between the larger  cities and can go to outskirt cities but those are a little more expensive yeah that does exist  sam how /none/ much to get a package to felderwin  matt to felderwin how big a package for a weeks worth of travel itll cost you about five  gold not too much  sam five gold  matt its a fairly upper end system to send a package  sam pretty good actually thats cheap  matt for you guys yeah for the average person its not cheap  liam ten games ago though  sam ill pay for rush delivery  matt there is no rush delivery they can only go by the speed of horse  sam ill get /none/ insurance  travis and sam certified  matt tracking number included  sam yes thank you

quite a headache  marisha quite a headache coffee the bacon that i had in my pocket from yesterday  matt pocket bacon its the best kind  marisha /none/ i head to the cobalt reserve  matt cobalt soul cobalt reserve is on taldorei  marisha sorry the cobalt soul branch in zadash  matt all righty you head to the archive what would you like to do  marisha ill see if i can find dairon  matt all right you ask around for a bit some of the various monks recognize you on entry and they  greet you with an acknowledging nod you didnt make a lot of friends while you were here of course  marisha sup  matt however you do come across archivist /none/ xenoth who as youre asking the question one of the  monks sends you over to xenoth he goes oh beauregard its good to see you  marisha hey  matt how may we help you  marisha is dairon in  matt i can go and inquire are you here for more training  marisha just find dairon thank you  matt he looks genuinely spooked by the smile and is like thats something manners thats new  im proud of   marisha just go find dairon  matt right all right he turns around and ascends up /dung/ one of the slowly curving staircases  that is carved through one of the bookshelves you see a bookshelf that ends and then a further depth  in and theres a staircase that rides up to the top theres a second level above hes gone for  about 15 or so minutes and then eventually descends the stairs from behind you can see  dairon her dark skin over the shoulders draped in this long cloakvest similar to the arraignments  you wear but with a deep gray her athome wear as she steps down her elvish features smiling  /none/ her eyes taking acknowledgement of your presence approaches you you have called for me  marisha talk in private  matt of course this way and dairon walks past xenoth goes it was good to see you beauregard  marisha bye xenoth  matt dairon leads you to one of the meeting chambers which is usually used for research and  individuals that want to quietly read through books or take notes dairon closes the door  behind and its just the two of you so what are the honors  marisha just want to let you know im in /town/ town and busy  matt good ive heard you are making a small name for yourself with your friends  marisha is that good or bad  matt i dont know is it  marisha i dont know its hard to read you  matt good ive worked hard to not be easy to read ill tell you one thing being invisible can  get you in some doors that otherwise you could not but notoriety can get you in doors that you  couldnt otherwise as well either path has its benefits the choice is yours which to take /town/  marisha you dont think the two could be mutually exclusive or best of both worlds  matt chuckles with enough training and discipline maybe two things unfortunately you lack  marisha hey  matt in time perhaps so why are you here just to tell me youre in town  marisha no that im back and im dedicated i figured showing up would be good you know  matt that is good im proud of you do you wish to train  marisha do you have time  matt i always have time  marisha my kind of woman /none/ lets go  matt all right dairon leads you out of the chamber and down below the archive where as you  recall is the subterranean training boxes for the monks in which you have sand pits you have all  sorts of assembled essentially the word escapes me a series of things you have to climb  marisha obstacle course  matt thank you an obstacle course my brain is not working right now at the moment obstacle  courses and places that are designed to help you gain more skill in advancing through urban and  exterior vicinities /none/ it looks like a parkour park a little bit but not there in that space you  and dairon spend the better part of the afternoon her essentially beating the shit out  of you via these courses showing you some better placement of your applications of extract aspects  hearing tales about the things youve encountered and teaching you the importance of the specific  bits of information that is most useful in the heat of battle advancing this training and  giving you a little more focused idea of the path that you have been taking and the /none/ path that you  are going  marisha i tell her about the xhorhasian spies and the terrorist that we encountered does she seem  like she knew that knowledge or not  matt she knew that they had come through she is caught off guard that you had actually encountered  them directly dairon says interesting i will take this into my studies  marisha they said they were looking for an artifact something that the wizards here had  stolen something that they said furthered their bloodline and made sure that they furthered their  population i dont /none/ know do you know anything about it  matt dairon goes from this very cold exterior for the first moment you see a brief crack of  emotion and she leans in whatever those things told you do not trust it do not take it as  anything but desire to conquer and kill  marisha why else would they attack the tower if they werent looking for something specific  matt oh im sure they were looking for something do not show pity for these things  marisha i never said i show pity i wanted to know what /none/ the hell this artifact was that they  were after figured you here at the cobalt soul would know  matt unfortunately the detailed business of the cerberus assembly is very carefully guarded and  outside of our jurisdiction but were doing our best to keep an eye in case anything slips through  the cracks they do a lot of good but i dont trust a mage that powerful  marisha we wouldnt have any records on some xhorhasian artifact that apparently keeps them alive  matt none that ive come across  marisha all right  matt keep /none/ your ear out if you encounter another one of these things these objects or at worse  another one of these cricks bring what it has bring it to us  marisha all right thank you dairon  matt of course i may not be here in a month or so  marisha what  matt im going to travel to bladegarden see what i can gather on the front lines with these  conflicts escalating i wish to be informed as to whos in charge there and perhaps what dangers  might be creeping further into the empire  /none/ marisha this bloodgarden in the northeast side  matt bladegarden is outside of where the garrisons are yes its where most of the main  military is held  marisha well i still have a lot of training so come back alive i guess  matt chuckles ive survived long enough anyway one more round of sparring  marisha sure  matt with that you and dairon continue to trade blows and continue the lessons throughout the day  travis thats awesome i want to do that obstacle course  marisha i go back and join the rest  matt /none/ anything else anyone wants to do  travis whispering dodecahedron next night  laura yeah i go knocking on his door the next night  liam i buy all that ink and paper and i spend the rest of that day learning a small handful of new  spells which are in the rolodex now and then the next night  laura rapidly knocking  liam ja hallo  laura still knocking hello  liam are you coming in come in its open  sam this is night time  matt at this point sure  sam i am definitely /none/ in the room  laura seductively hello caleb hello nott  sam suspiciously hi  laughter  laura caleb and i have a date to talk about his special package  sam do you need some privacy  laura no were good i open up the haversack and pull out the box  liam we are going to attempt to examine the football as it were you can remain if you like  are you curious yourself  sam sure you might need me to heal you  liam to the best ooh thats a good idea you know to /none/ the best of my knowledge this is and  its limited this is a very powerful thing and we are taking a risk  laura okay  liam but one that i think is worthwhile  laura okay  liam are you still game  laura clenching yes  liam all right we put the lead box on the floor lets leave it in the lead box but well lift the lid  laura thats probably good because people are still looking for it probably so its probably  stupid that were fucking with it right now  liam it /none/ is a calculated risk and we are going to do this we are not going to take a lot of time  sam its nice that you guys are talking about your limitations and setting your expectations  before you go into this together theres some word that you need like a safething  liam yes the safe word is fjord so if shit goes pearshaped and one of us says fjord get fjord  sam sure  laura yes are you going to go all like tonal sound while you look at it or are you going to  /none/ be normal  liam truthfully i have no idea  laura okay cool  liam you game  laura totally game  liam okay i am not coming on to you but will you hold my hand while we do this that way if  we laughter i cannot even look at you i cannot believe i am doing this experiment with  you lets not cover the camera and lets examine it together and if we go to the nine hells or  something at least well be there together in theory  laura okay  liam we are /none/ going to look at this thing  matt both of you or just you  liam i dont know i am looking at it  laura im looking at caleb  laughter  matt all right as you focus on the strange artifact concentrating on it you feel your  vision drawn towards it part of you feels like your bodys leaning forward like youre about to  hit your forehead but caleb hasnt moved at all  laura oh okay  matt caleb hasnt moved but from your perspective you feel like and then suddenly  you feel like /none/ youre within the dodecahedron and like previously suddenly theres this loss of  light and stars begin to peek out around you  matt you see shapes and forms of purples and blues these amorphous clouds that drift by on a  scale that you cannot comprehend you see darkened spheres and objects passing you as you drift into  nothing into this void with distant dots of light and sparkle you get to that point you were  before where you feel like theres a threshold and your heart begins to race do you continue  liam whispers yeah /none/  laura ive got his hand  matt as you continue past that threshold the speed begins to increase  laura excitedly oh no  matt you feel the back of your neck begin to grow warm and the hair begin to stand up while you  cannot see you can still sense your bodys presence unmoving but moving so quickly this  duel sensation is conflicting and causing your heart rate to jump your breathing begins to speed  up you guys watch as his breathing begins to increase there you see this faint gray glow  approach and /none/ stop your speed comes to a slow crawl and then halts there before you you see  this tiny little mote of gray pulsing light a similar undulating pulse as the dodecahedron  itself heartbeat before you what do you do  laura growling what do you do  sam grumbling noises  liam long pause do you know if its achievable  matt no response it looks like its right there but a foot in front of you  liam theres nothing about it that is sensible or familiar its totally alien to me  matt it is immediacy /none/ and forever it is an ancient concept of possibility as you ask these  questions and begin to contemplate the loop of your thought process begins to cycle on itself  and you have to shake your head not to be lost in this infinity that threatens to suddenly disperse  you still it is this tiny gray thing before you and it seems to want your contact  laura whispering lick it  matt you look down and you can see your hand in front of you  liam father and mother i hope i do not let you /none/ down  matt as you reach out and touch you guys watch as this  laura did we hear him talking  matt you hear him talking you see a faint mote of gray begin to drift out of the dodecahedron  and then it floats and enters and vanishes into the chest of caleb  travis and laura oh shit  matt caleb you feel this tiny mote come into your hand and then you pull it to your chest and  you feel this warmth and for a second probability becomes slightly malleable this object is still  /none/ so much more than what you understand its power is indecipherable on the scale of your puny  mortal knowledge but you do know that somehow by reaching out to this device youve managed to  pull within yourself a fragment of possibility  sam what does that mean fragment of possibility  laura it means hes lucky again  marisha yeah its the luck feat all over again  matt just so you guys know well hell tell you when he gets around to it  sam no he wont he will never tell us  travis come on /none/ dish  matt thats up to him to tell in the story  liam its a big paper let me read it  laura did we get it too because we were holding his hand  matt no the moment that that enters his chest caleb pulls his hand from you caleb your eyes  adjust and youre back in the room with your friends  laura whispering damn it  sam caleb are you okay you went skinkydoodle for a second are you all right hello hello  wildemount to caleb  liam im wideeyed and not responding  /none/ sam he cant speak anymore hes forgotten  laura caleb we heard you talking though are you okay caleb  sam eins zwei drei hes forgotten all language  laura uno dos tres quatro  liam im literally trying to read this and failing because of my friends  sam quick make out with him true loves kiss is the only thing that will bring him back  laura i think he seems like hes pretty okay though  sam just make out with him  ashley laughter true loves kiss  laura i dont know  marisha focus past /none/ the distractions  travis or you could just tell us  laura you could read it out loud you know  taliesin whats it say  marisha never hes never going to tell us  matt player privilege unfortunately hes the one who that looked into it if he doesnt tell  you soon ill tell you but  liam thats your right i literally still dont know what it does because everyone is talking constantly  laura if you read it out loud then well shut up  travis yeah well share in this adventure with you  laura /none/ thats right then we can all be a team  liam the dodecahedron of gray faintly glowing crystal is heavier than it appears this is peer  pressure a set of handles are affixed to the sides and it undulates to the touch thats all  you get if a hand is placed on the artifact and is concentrated on for one minute the bearer is  granted a fragment of possibility a fragment lasts for eight hours or until used a fragment  cannot be granted again until the next dawn after a creature with a fragment of possibility /none/ makes an  attack roll ability check or saving throw they can expend their fragment to roll an additional  d20 and choose which of the rolls is used for the attack roll  matt once per day it can grant one person a luck point  laura we can pass it around  liam ultimately after an attack roll is made against a creature they can expend their fragment  of possibility to roll and additional d20 to see if the attacker hits  marisha youre like chipping away at it like an ice sculpture  liam it is /none/ like one luck that lasts for eight hours  matt it grants you this mote of energy  laura we could literally we could each of us every day pass it to a different person and then  we could concentrate on it and we could have the fragment  liam am i able to tell if that is correct  matt it gives you the fragment only lasts for eight hours you can only give out one fragment  per day so  liam any one of us one time it can only grant this gift once a day /none/ to one of us  matt correct yes it could be the same person every day or it could be a different person it  gives you the chance that this could be used by anybody in your group  liam i absentmindedly babble about what i think this thing can do its very incoherent  laura why were you talking about your mom and your dad though  silence  laura was that a weird question should i have not asked that  sam i mean it was on my mind but i wasnt going to bring it up /none/  laughter  liam what did i say what do you mean  laura you said mom and dad i hope that i make you proud  sam or dont disappoint you  laura and i dont disappoint you and stuff and also gee whiz i should probably take baths  more often  sam thats not not that part  laura well you were going to say that and then the gray thing went into you  liam okay  sam you said oh i wish i could share my problems with my friends  laura yeah thats what /none/ youre saying i remember hearing that part  laughter  liam what that is a very common sentiment isnt it  sam it is  laura if you ever want to talk about it you can just come to us  liam good to know  laura were super good at talking both of us  liam that is true for both of you  laura tomorrow i want the thingy okay  liam well you are in possession of it for the most part i said i wanted to have a look at it  laura youre right i /town/ am  liam we can take turns with it we will decide  sam we dont have to tell the others about this do we i mean were supposed to be a team  liam by the way i shut the lead cover on the box lets put it back in  laura gasping oh my gods what if now that the gray thing is in you the wizards in town will  be able to sense you  sam what why would that no  laura maybe you should be in the lead case now  liam thats not /none/ how that works  laura are you sure though  liam i am sure yeah also with the knowledge that i have and everything that just happened am  i aware the gray more that went inside me would i know does that limit this things ability to me  or no  matt what do you mean  liam well in the description dm you said this gray mote went into caleb not into them can  anyone use this thing  matt anyone can use it  liam good all right just checking  laura the next day /none/ the gray thing will go in someone else  liam right its like the little you know when youre learning lyrics for karaoke and the little  thing bounces along  sam we all know what that experience is like  liam yeah i think this is a very potent thing and we can use it to do a lot of good you know  not in the heat of the moment to try to hit a gnoll in the face with something but when we are  really trying to figure something out or do the unachievable  laura /none/ or if like you really want to put a mustache on a fucking statue  sam you need extra luck for that  liam thats a good hypothetical  laura yeah just in case you ever wanted to do that  sam can i just say real quick before we adjourn there was something that you were  reluctant to do because of your own personal fears and you entrusted jester to inspire you to  do something that was possibly uncomfortable for you and it worked out great i think that moving  forward if you want to just /none/ go for it as long as you have trusted friends with you then that would  be a good option to do  liam that was a lot of advice i mean it is no secret that i like these people so we are in good company  this is working out you are you know you are capable oh dear im going to go to bed now  laura your son is just the cutest  sam hes not my son  liam definitely heard that awkward and weird and makes no sense but i will oh this is /town/ my room  you have to go to your room  laura singsong okay well goodnight then  liam goodnight  laura goodnight caleb if you need anything ill just be in another room  sam get out just go just leave  matt the following day through your various lowkey journeys you catch another town crier  wandering through the town shouting murderers of the highrichter brought to justice by the  crowns protective eye zadash is free from these treacherous cutthroats  laura who was it  sam who was it who killed

morning  ashley how do they give you more information just a headline theres nothing else  matt over the next few days the crownsguard and the righteous brand which is the name of the  military of the empire the presence at the gates of zadash has dwindled to normal the backed up  caravans and travellers begin to wash /town/ into the city once more in preparation for the harvest  close festival now
