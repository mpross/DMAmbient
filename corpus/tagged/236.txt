exactly to get you guys up to speed the party vox machina after having a relatively  violent encounter with /town/ a couple known as the briarwoods lady delilah briarwood and lord sylas  briarwood two individuals who were responsible for essentially torturing and murdering percys  family and taking over his town of whitestone and for the past five years have ruled it guiding it  into some dark direction theyve begun to recently unravel the party traveled to whitestone to clear  their name as they were essentially put in a bad political position with their home town of emon  and to possibly bring vengeance for what percys family had undergone five years before  upon arriving they /town/ found the town in a very dark emotional place zombie giants roving the streets  as these controlled centurions a number of individuals in the town feeling the general  unrest and they decided to build a revolt percy helming the de rolo crest vox machina went around  inciting the thoughts of rebellion in the city not the first but apparently the one with the most  chance of succeeding theyve had to this date after some infiltrations and sizable victories  cutting down some of the underlings of the briarwoods within the city the people began to  /none/ arm themselves rise up and fire blade and screaming took the city as the denizens began to  fight back in this chaos vox machina made their way underneath the castle whitestone where the  lord and lady briarwood currently reside seeking some sort of a project called the ziggurat theyve  been working on for a while  while they were down there they found a woman apparently imprisoned under an illusion that they  revealed to be anna ripley dr anna ripley one of the torturers of percy five years before and  currently seemingly interested in the /none/ black powder based gun tech he had been developing however  they took her captive went upstairs and discovered that percys sister cassandra is  indeed still alive and being held captive within the castle in the process of trying to save her  anna ripley got away cassandra got her throat cut but thankfully was saved by the quick actions of  vox machina and the near deaths door stepping of vax once again but nevertheless saved her  prevented her disastrous fate  liam before anyone entered the room  matt thats true  laughter  matt so /none/ having cassandra saved some intense conversations began some discussions of some  elements of the briarwoods real intentions they found notes within professor anderss room one of  the other individuals responsible for rising up against percys family back in the day found  materials that could clear their name back in emon and cassandra armed up they made their way down  to the basement of the city into the undercroft and through the mausoleum that contained the  descendants of the de rolo family  after which a series of ghosts seemingly haunting that vicinity since the darkness /none/ that  took this kingdom took hold began to possess the party into a rough battle in which they were  forced to fight themselves the ghosts were ousted destroyed and the party regathering what  powers they still have at their disposal to begin to delve into the seemingly recently dug tunnel  beneath the city of whitestone towards whatever this ziggurat project is and that is where we  left off last time  as you guys have taken a moment to gather your breath after the undercroft infiltration of  these spirits one of the last of /none/ which scanlan shamed into a redeath  laughter  matt youve all gathered yourself taken a short rest to heal up whatever else you want to do to  prepare at this time you know discussion items preparation trading anything you want to do  before you delve any further into this tunnel underneath the city of whitestone now is the time  to do so  sam were in the crypt the sarcophagus sort of thing  matt thats the actual official name yes  liam percival do you know anything do you know whats just ahead of us /town/  taliesin i dont think so  matt no the back wall of this mausoleum was originally just a wall there was a large  20foot wide cavern that is chiseled through the stonework and appears to delve deeper into the  ground behind them  all whoa  matt we got a laura bailey  laura whats up buddies  liam award show variant costume  laughter  matt the comiccon night on the town  laura thats right gasps hey ashley  ashley oh hello laura you look so pretty  laura oh my gosh thats so cool /none/  liam she cant see you there  matt congratulations

well ive got to go and i got up  and ran and i feel like an idiot  travis we got briarwoods to kill  taliesin briorities  matt well im glad you could join us thank you for that  sam did /none/ you say briorities  taliesin briorities  laura briorities  matt taliesin  travis we dont know if we have any further to go from this crypt uncharted  laura thats my thing oh theres no drink in my  liam well go quick  marisha do it its fine were just starting  liam i didnt want to touch it  taliesin weve literally not had a conversation  marisha we havent done anything  sam all right im going to charge in  laughter  travis i would like to take a vial of holy oil that i /none/ have out of the bag of holding and keep it  in my hand just out so i dont have to get it out  marisha grog speaking of how many health potions do you have i feel like we might need to  redistribute  travis i have a shitload i never really use them  marisha you should do that  travis i have two level awesome what are the biggest ones  sam greater  matt theres greater or superior  travis i have two superior one the top one and five of the low ones  /none/ taliesin can i take two of the low ones possibly  matt superior would be the highest youve received so far  travis okay then i have one of those  liam i am all out of tricks just about so may i please have a superior grog  travis oh boy does everybody want a piece of this pie  laughter  travis well what are you offering  liam im offering safety for your facial hair for perpetuity  travis nope give me something else  liam now its in danger  marisha how about safety for your /none/ life because well be having your back and whatnot  travis how could you have my back if its on me  marisha im going to let that one go  liam i will let you flick me hard hard in the nads should we survive  travis how about you let me flick you hard in the nads now and ill give you a healing potion  liam can we take a short rest after that  laughter  laura what is happening laughs  travis just a little one i wont even rage or nothing itll just be /none/ a quick little tap on your  walnut  liam i will do this trade  travis yes i kneel down and i get right up to his bits  liam wait i pull a stick out of my bag and i put it in my mouth and i bite down very hard on it  sam im going to use minor illusion to create a bulls eye right around his crotch concentric  circles glowing  travis and like the second grader i am trying to write in cursive i have my tongue sticking out  like and i /none/ shift from using the middle finger down to the ring finger because were being nice  and i go for are you righthanded  liam yeah  travis i go for the left nut whack  liam groans  travis does he throw up  matt no but you do take one point of damage  travis yes  laura just one its just a ring finger but its still a goliath  travis is there a little cough  matt yeah theres definitely enough of a reaction to be worth your  liam hoarse theres no sound at all /none/  travis all right i will give you one of the theres three different levels or just the two  matt well you have you have common sorry the healing potion the greater healing and the  superior  liam hoarse the good one fucker  travis ill give you the greater i give him a greater and percy i like it when you turn into  the giant cloud thing so you dont have to take a nutshot would you like a common or a greater  taliesin actually if i could steal two commons just to be on /none/ the safe side  travis yeah okay i give him two common  taliesin i offer the satisfaction of vax knowing that i got them for free  matt cassandra also steps forward and says i myself do not have any sort of potion of  protection does anyone have anything which they could offer  sam yes hello hi i look like your brother but im shorter  matt yes thats right by the way everyone is currently  taliesin currently everybody looks  matt like either percy or cassandra thanks to scanlans seeming which is really awkward  /none/ liam hoarse are we going to hold this up for when we go against the briarwoods i think itll  be confusing  sam yeah for them you can have one of my greater healing potions will that suffice  matt certainly thank you and she comes forward and reaches out towards you and you have  to reach up and put it in her hand because shes reaching out towards a much taller figure  sam oh i look like a fullsize percy  matt a little larger in between  sam oh cool  taliesin i throw her /none/ one of my commons as well  travis i have three commons two greaters and one superior im a walking medicine cabinet  matt you are  sam speaking of looking like percy and cassandra vex  laura huh  sam that is you right  laura thats me yes what  sam vex if you if you look like cassandra you could conceivably get in front of the briarwoods  without them knowing that its an enemy for a moment maybe long enough to fire off one of  your dont you have some sort of sunbeam arrow or /none/ something  laura i have no sunbeam arrow but i would like to dip some arrows in some holy oil at this moment  in time  matt all right  laura i do have potentially an exploding holy arrow  sam that would be pretty baller  matt is this the one with the question mark  laura no this is a normal one and then i have a question mark as well  matt do you want to dip them both  laura fuck yes i do  matt laughs okay you have two more uses of your /none/ holy oil i believe right  laura yes well no each thing takes three arrows so i can do six arrows altogether  matt youre using it all right now  travis will it wear off  matt it lasts for an hour  laura are we going to get there  sam i dont know we could fight them in five minutes  laura i want to do it right before we walk in the room matt  matt its up to you you can hold off  liam we dont see a ziggurat yet  taliesin lets start /none/ making our way down there and i cant believe im going to say this but  well have vax scout ahead  sam dont do anything  laura dont do anything look dont touch  taliesin vax weve discussed our new password do you remember the new password  sam which is  laura is there something different  liam is it candyland no i dont remember  taliesin its now jenga one onethousand two onethousand three onethousand four  onethousand five onethousand six onethousand seven onethousand eight onethousand nine  onethousand ten  liam i just got flicked in /none/ the nuts im not doing that ill say jenga  laura and then wait  liam yeah ill wait so long as no more of your siblings are in danger i did do it for reasons  taliesin we know  liam you know because i told you  taliesin yes i consider the matter settled  liam i dont know exactly what was going to happen but i saw a blade against your sisters  throat i would hope you would do the same for my sister if you were to see the same thing  taliesin yes  /none/ laura of course he would  taliesin but mostly because i fear her  liam scanlan back me up if you were to turn into some sort of threehorned beast and go  running into a house full of enemies we would give him a similar talkingto correct  sam that would never happen im more measured than all of you  taliesin we dont actually believe that he will listen to sense  sam im percy  laughter  taliesin we just cant waste our breath really  liam scanlan shut up  travis attunement how long does that /none/ take  matt a short rest  taliesin this is going to be a very complicated evening  travis should we take a short rest  taliesin we just did  travis we did  laura oh we did  matt if you wanted to attune to something during that short rest you can  travis can i attune to boots of levitation  matt if youd like to yeah  travis i would like to  matt okay  liam we just rested for 30 minutes  matt roughly 30 minutes yeah  liam how would everyone feel about /none/ another seven and a half hours  laura we cant sleep in this  sam our meal is still active as well we need the benefits of that plus there is a rebellion  going on its been what an hour two hours theyre probably mostly dead by now  marisha thats possibly very true actually  taliesin cassandra  matt yes  taliesin in your opinion whos the more dangerous target  matt she gets distant for a second thinking and haphazardly pulls the hair over her ear and rubs  her armor in a nervous way looks over /dung/ out of the side of her eyes to you and says theyre both  dangerous for different reasons separately sylas is dangerous because of his unnatural nature ive  seen him turn arguments and opposing sides into friendships in but an instant he has some sort of  power over the mind of those he looks to that in itself is a danger not to mention his other  capabilities ive only seen him use it twice but that blade he carries is as dark as he is  that being said lady briarwood delilah she carries magic far more /none/ powerful than ive seen  she on her own was able to create run and rule each of these sentries that run about the entire  city she had half of the entire castle staffed with longdead individuals none questioned her  ive never seen her in battle but i sense there is far more to her abilities than ive seen  the two of them together are driven more so than the affiliation to this whispered one they  talk of theyre driven by one thing and thats their affection for each other as long as they  are /none/ together who knows what theyre capable of  laura so we split them up  travis yeah weve got to divide and conquer this shit  taliesin if we can  travis if we can  marisha cassandra  matt yes  marisha has there been any instance where the two have separated in the recent months that you can  imagine or remember  matt most of the ziggurat construction happens during the evening when sylas is not resting and  for the most part they journey together for the past month at least no i havent seen them /none/  apart really  marisha can you think of any reason why they would separate  matt not unless something in the sun required their attention  marisha something sudden that required their attention  matt in the sun  marisha in the sun  matt sylas does not appear to like being outside  travis yeah one thing do we want to take the battle to them down here or do we want to try and  lure them outside  liam i think we would definitely prefer them outside but what would draw them out  i do /none/ not know  laura what if we used seeming and made one of us seem like lady briarwood  taliesin i think they would see through that  laura yes  travis they saw through the disguise at the table back in emon  sam just to point this out before we go in and kill ourselves we have evidence now we could  abandon this whole thing go back and fight our day in court  taliesin i want to see what theyre building down there and i worry that it would be dangerous  marisha plus wed just /none/ abandon this entire revolution that we caused  liam people are putting their lives on the line plus uriel is suspect now hes been corrupted  he is not trustworthy theres no point going back to him  taliesin i cant leave again until this is taken care of  sam right that was a stupid suggestion keyleth  travis keyleth come on weve got to stay  sam were all seemed differently its very strange  travis im really disappointed keyleth  liam cassandra i want to say something a little frank im very happy that weve found you /none/ im  very happy that percival and you have been reunited we have been burned very badly in the  past by seeming allies and i am sure you are in your right mind but past experience has taught us  to be very careful and we are all watching you for signs of corruption or control i want to  believe you are in control of your faculties i do not fully trust you are and i think just letting  you know that a knife could hit your back as soon as the slightest misstep happened is maybe /none/ enough  to ensure some safety for this group  matt of course it is true i have been living here at least in this castle with them for the  past three years not not of choice of course and were i in your position  would think the same  liam according to percival they filled you with arrows what happened  matt well i was near death i was recovered by the father that runs the temple of pelor and a few  other individuals who had fled the city at the time i was as far /none/ as i was concerned i was gone  but they nursed me back to health slowly over time i was for the better part useless as an  individual for about six months and even to this day i have a bit of a wheeze when i expend  myself but father reynal made sure that i was in good health and that was when i learned truly  what had become of the city in my restoration and it was there that we began to speak of the early  talks of rebellion here in whitestone me being still /town/ alive was enough of a beacon for those who  knew for us to put together our first attempt to fight out from under their rule and it was  marked they knew every step we took many lives were lost but in that fray they recognized me  they didnt know i was alive either i guess they saw the importance of keeping me under their lock  and key as a way of crushing whatever hope those who still lived here had  liam why not hang you from that tree in the center of town like they /none/ did so many others  matt that would have certainly made a statement there were many days when they first took me  captive i would have welcomed that but in that time we planned that first rebellion i saw fire  in the eyes of my people brighter than any i had witnessed in my youth i saw their love for my  family i saw the intent of these people to take back what was theirs from this corrupt force and  i knew that i had a part to play if they choose to leave me alive /none/ as much as they try and sway my  interests it also brought me close to them i watched them i could see what they were planning  try and gather details of this construct theyre working on beneath the city and feed this  information to those who i knew were still true and behind the de rolo family name i dont know  what i can say to offer you more than that  liam i dont think theres anything you can say  laura whispers can i insight check her  liam i want you back in /none/ my friends life but im sorry i do not trust you and i and the others  will be watching  laura whispers 21  matt 21 okay looking every word that comes out of her mouth comes with conviction comes from a  look of a person whos recalling a painful memory there is nothing that belies any deceit  sam onward  travis yeah  laura and upward  marisha are we going to try and separate these two is that the plan  taliesin i think were going to take the lay of the land first see /none/ what were up against  travis not a bad idea with cass but well see  taliesin vax  liam all right so im going to go ahead through the hole  laura should i stealth with you  liam sure youre very good at that now because of my gift to you  laura hey  matt hey there you go you guys are both going to stealth ahead twins side by side all right  go ahead and roll stealth checks you get advantage laura  laura i get advantage because of the gold dress  marisha the /none/ sparkles are magical  taliesin magic sparkles  liam 32  taliesin it does look like mithril doesnt it  laura 23  matt all right the two of you go ahead can i have a marching order here  laura him first  liam me first yeah her dress sparkles too much  matt trinket stays with the rest of the party i assume  laura yes trinket stays  matt all right whos going to be towards the front of this traveling pack  liam were going way ahead  matt right but everyone else is following behind /none/ though  travis ill be in the front meat shield  matt all righty  sam i will be right behind the meat shield  taliesin i will be right behind the  liam percy number four  laura trinket follows percy hes following percy  matt okay trinkets following percy  marisha following up the ranks with trinket i guess  matt all right and as soon as you enter the cavern and begin stepping forward into the tunnel  theres a flash of light right before you for a second blinding you and you instinctively step  back /none/ and pull your daggers out before you realize the flash is now a glowing symbol on your hand  the crest of sarenrae thats been stitched into your glove is now pulsing with an energy  liam hi pike  matt and you hear for a second call out pikes voice ring through the darkness and you see  before you out of the shadow out of the blackness that is before you in the cavern a  small gnomish hand reach out for you  ashley are you all still there  laura pike  liam i take her /none/ hand i take your hand pike and i kneel down and i press the back of her hand to  my forehead and hold it there for a moment  matt as you do the glow from the glove begins to spread from your hand across and all of you guys  see materializing out of the darkness pikes form slowly unravel into this shadowed area into this  glowing beacon of her holy form that you previously traveled with as pike is now once  again brought to this point of clarity here beneath the castle whitestone  travis /none/ i run over and i knock vax out of the way and i pick up pike and give her a big hug  liam my nut  travis oh pike im so glad to see you  ashley grog but you dont look like grog  travis what oh no whispers its me  ashley is everybody percy and cassandra  all yes  laura except for you darling  matt its very weird youre a tiny gnome in armor and everyone else looks like percy and a  woman youve never seen before in your life  taliesin bearpercy /none/ is especially disturbing  matt yeah this giant rotund percy on his hands and legs just bear noises  laura that is awkward  matt its a very strange visual and youre very confused momentarily  ashley i give percytrink some ear scratches  laura he likes it  matt bear noises  sam i run over and i say pike pike what happened you disappeared before but now youre  back are you here to stay whats going on  ashley im here to stay for as long as i can its very hard to stay in this form /dung/ especially  when this place is very dark and sometimes i just get pulled away so im going to  stay as long as i can  sam were so happy to have you here  marisha so happy to have you here  ashley im so happy to be here how are you how are you guys are you okay where are you at in  terms of health  sam were all healthy  ashley okay  travis vax is minus a hit point because i hit him in the nuts hah  ashley laughs oh grog  /none/ sam and we have a new member well a new traveling companion this is cassandra  taliesin cassandra de rolo  laura the actual cassandra  ashley i go over and put my hand out and hold her hand and say its so very nice to finally meet you  matt she takes your hand and looks down curiously at this tiny gnome that seems to have apparated  out of the shadows and gives you a curious look and a big smile creeps across her face it is my  pleasure to have good people around me for once /none/ pleasure to meet you young gnome which is funny  coming from her because shes technically younger than you she looks hardened but shes younger  than you  laura well shall we  taliesin now that were together  laura shall we keep moving  travis now were definitely going to kick some ass  sam with pike with us we can do anything  marisha is she glowing  matt pike is giving low candlelight around her so youre going to want to keep her towards the  back probably  laura pike always ruins stealth  laughter /none/  laura even when shes a ghostly form  sam can we hang a sheet over her or something  matt you can itll be like throwing a tshirt over your bedroom light itll just be a nice  atmospheric chinese lantern  laura ooh mood lighting  matt there you go  liam i place my sarenrae hand on her shoulder and say youre here because she willed you to be  here she knows that we need you now please hide behind obese percival and i pat my sister on the  shoulder and head back into the /none/ darkness  matt okay so as pike comes to the back smiling at everybody she joins the back ranks of keyleth  and trinket actually probably behind percy cassandras going to be right there flying v  formation and you guys continue down this tunnel  laura check for traps  liam yeah perception all that shit down  matt yeah  laura yeah perception oh yeah i should do it too hold on  liam 20 for me  laura yeah i know right 18 for me  matt all right you guys continue on this slowly descending tunnel /none/ for about ten minutes or so  before you see it divide to the left very heavily and then continue forward theres still no light  source here and so youre relying on your darkvision to continue but theres the switchback  to the left and the one that continues forward  liam i lean over to my sister and say im not going to do anything im just going to look 50  feet down  laura how about wait a fucking second and let me look for footprints  liam all right  laura can i look for /none/ footprints  matt you can make a survival check  laura okay i dont know which one to use im so nervous okay lets do this one that was a bad  one im perceptioning  matt this is a survival  laura oh well its the same that is a 16  matt 16 okay you get down and inspect the area you actually pull out a small bit of torch pith  and light it a bit just to get a little light across this one intersection briefly there are  footprints back and forth in all ways /none/ but many of them have been at least the footprints coming  from and the last footprints were coming from this tunnel to your immediate left were from a  while back the fresher footprints fresh as of four hours continue on down that way you do  notice that the smell of the air itself is you notice this as well as youre inspecting the air  down here has a very acrid sharp scent anyway a hint of chemical it seems to be getting stronger  to the left  laura thats where the acid pits are acid /none/ briarwoods briarwoods  travis yeah  matt all right continuing to push forward about another five minutes or so keeping track of your  distance to the castle youre starting to get towards the outside perimeter of the actual city  itself as youre keeping tabs on distance traveled to that area you catch based on your  last perception roll there is a portion of the floor that seems to have some placed crooked  chunks of stone you see pieces of broken stone here and there things that have fallen out from  being hauled from the distant /none/ dig into wherever the ziggurat is but theres one section where it  appears theres platforms  liam looks a little hinky  matt it looks like its deliberately placed as opposed to dropped and left there  liam id like to carefully approach and disarm anything i can detect or find  matt okay go ahead and make a check  liam is that thieves tools  matt thats thieves tools yeah  liam thats a 27  matt okay you find two of the large stone slabs that are part of this discarded sequence here they  have /none/ beneath them some small magical burst that is waiting to detonate you manage to mark it and  take a couple of other stone pieces to wedge underneath it to prevent it from depressing onto  whatever the trigger may be and note to the rest of the party to avoid that section  liam theres a couple of stones here that ive marked in the middle of the path dont step on  them please  taliesin copy  travis somebody tell trinket  sam and pike  laura he fucking understands signs  marisha ill be in charge /none/ of guiding trinket  matt okay  laura he listens to you  matt the awkward large bearpercy  laura they got the message  marisha hes still my friend at least the bear still loves me  matt you continue forward for another id say 20 minutes go ahead and make another  perception check  liam 20  laura 21 again  matt okay both of you guys walking forward both step out and look down just in time to stop  your foot from pressing onto what looks to be a mound of dirt that is once /none/ again deliberately  placed and a little more fresh than the rest of the dustcovered hallway you can see theres an  area that is distinctly a different shade of color based on the lack of dust on top of it and you  both stop just in time thank you very much i got fries  liam i give her the universal rogue movement for scoot back yeah keep going ten feet or so all  right im going to inspect and try to do the same 26  matt you approach this mound and as soon as you /none/ get close to it you pull out your tools youre  not quite sure how this initially works and as you begin to push slightly on the dirt on one  side you can see the other side shifts a little bit from the weight its like theres something  beneath the dirt that has some sort of shifting property to it and you gather based on the  way it reacted there is a gas contained beneath this to disarm it would be difficult but you can  ascertain the nature of its detonation and once again you can /none/ mark this to not be placed  liam does it take the whole passage  matt its right in the center so it can be bypassed if you stick directly to the right or  left and work along the sides trinket may be a little difficult to work on but well make a roll  for that  laura oh no  matt what could possibly go wrong  liam all right people we have some gas trapped under a mound of shit up here  sam some gas  laura yeah it smells like grog so avoid it /none/  liam something bad im going to stay here id like you all to bring up the rear and kiki bring  the bear bring my nephew up and id like everyone to pass ahead and my sister and i will  get trinket up behind you all  travis i have a question how are we marking these traps  liam chalk the last one was marked with chalk this one im just standing in front of  travis were coming across a lot of these if we need to make a quick escape it might be a  /none/ problem  sam if were going back out the way we came in  travis in a hurry  taliesin well just have to remember  travis oh yeah  marisha hopefully we wont be in a hurry  sam well well just have trinket run first  liam im sure youve got something in that bag of yours that we can plop in front of this for now  lets just get past it  matt all right so you each make your way around this when it comes to trinkets side ill say  for you because hell /none/ probably need a little help making his way across so go ahead and just make a  dexterity check for trinket with advantage with the aid from the party  laura okay thats not good eight  matt eight okay  liam plus anything  laura nope  marisha thats for trinket  laura yeah  matt okay so whos helping trinket  liam i am we are i assume  travis ill help trinket  taliesin ill also say if this was a gas trap i would probably throw my mask on before passing it  as well  /none/ travis ill help trinket  matt okay so just you grog  travis just me  matt okay as everyone continues pushing forward you reach out helping trinket get along  trinkets pushing up the side of the cavern claws scraping on the side of the wall foot slips  slams into the mound of dirt at which point the mound depresses and then explosion bursts open  into a 20 by 20foot gas cloud  marisha can i cast gust of wind really quick and push it back down the hallway  matt you can start doing that because /none/ it is a lingering cloud effect regardless i need you and  trinket to both make a constitution save  travis yes 21 nope 20  matt laura can you roll a constitution save for trinket  laura nervous laugh yeah  travis 17  laura just regular  matt just a regular constitution save  laura seven  matt seven okay you suffer six points of poison damage trinket suffers 12 points of poison  damage  sam grog you suffer no poison damage we had our meal  travis heroes feast  laura and trinket ate it too /none/  marisha thats true  laura were immune to poison  marisha were immune to fear and poison  laura gasps thats amazing  matt as the cloud begins to fill the area you breathe it in and theres that reactionary point  of like shit get trinket out of there and then you realize the harshness of the toxin  doesnt seem to be affecting your system there is some element of the holy shit its delicious  feast you guys had that is keeping the toxins at bay from entering your system  travis i spent the last /none/ few years building up an immunity to iocane powder  laughter  marisha also doesnt your belt of dwarvenkind have something like that  travis nope  marisha no okay never mind  laura he just grows a beard you have advantage on charisma  travis i have resistance against poison damage  laura you have advantage on persuasion checks  travis i know  laura thats awesome  matt you take half poison damage whenever you do take poison damage  laura oh where did pike go  sam no pike the evil of this place is making it /none/ hard to maintain her connection  marisha i know its hard its deep underground  liam oh  marisha hey  ashley this astral projection is very hard to hold  laughter  matt thats all right  taliesin we live in an age of miracles and wonders  matt so as you guys pass under this cloud you  ashley the connection is just not very strong  matt thats all right its much better now keyleth you push the toxin cloud back and hit it  off to the side pushing it down the same tunnel that the /none/ acid section was itll take you a while  to get it back there but you can just leave it lingering in the tunnel if youd like  marisha no its fine ill just leave it its fine  matt okay it seems to be pervasive for now it may eventually fade or sink into the earth but  itll take a while for that to happen but you move past this trap you continue forward and the  descent grows steadily more and more steep at this point what was like a relative decline has now  gotten to /none/ the point where some of you have to get up against the wall as you step down not to the  point where its slideworthy or anything but enough where it gets a little precarious for those  who dont have quite as much a grand hold on loose earth about five minutes of this it evens out  though and as it does you come to a metallic doorway  travis of course  laura god damn doors  sam i got this  travis please just do it  laura inspect it for traps  travis no let /none/ him take it  liam why dont i look and then scanlan can handle it im just going to look all right  yeah 23  matt okay the door does not appear to be trapped but it is locked  liam well  laura can you pick it  liam probably  travis metal door right  matt yeah  liam natural 20  matt all right so looking at the door and the closer you get as you bring some light source to  it you can see the door itself is not an iron or a slate /none/ metal its hammered bronze  the surface is semismooth but it does have a bit of a warp to it from when the  metal was originally plied and used to create this doorway so it has this hammered look across its  entire surface some small rivets in the side you do notice that there is no handle for it but on  the other side of the door there is something that is latched over it so using your dagger you  manage to lift it slightly and then shove forward through the slight edge of the door /none/ frame to the  door itself or means to force this off of its latch and you hear the metallic arm bang against  the other side of the door as it falls down and the door pushes open slightly  liam i look back to the group and go it wont open it wont  laughter  liam i dont push it that far only like four or five inches just to peer through  matt okay that same acrid smell that has permeated into the hallway continues into this  room its a little colder the temperature in /none/ this room is because as you notice looking in  what little bit of distance you can see in this pitch black vicinity the entire room is made of  this type of hammered bronze  travis before we go in are there any bits of whitestone on the ground like stuff in chunks or  small pieces or is it pretty cleanish  matt as you travel through here you see chunks here and there some of them appear to be yeah  nothing bigger than what you can fit in your palm any of the larger pieces seem /none/ to have made their  way all the way back to the undercroft where you guys had the ghost battle at this point youve  just seen bits and pieces that may have fallen out of whatever carts were brought through and you do  see grooves in the ground where like large wheeled carts were pushed back and forth up and down this  tunnel to carry materials to and from  liam i pull the door a little bit shut behind me and turn to the group and say this is a room  made entirely of metal /dung/ that presumably did not exist five years ago i think this is probably  bad sister dear would you help me look just from the door please just look  travis scanlan just shoot a lightning bolt in there  liam no in a moment please and perception check the room from here  matt go for it  liam 29  laura oh thats good thats better than mine but not much 23  travis question mark  matt okay both glancing in what little bit of space you have to poke through you can see the  room /none/ itself its about 80 feet across and about 50 feet wide from the doorway its a slight ramp  that leads down into an open floor area also the bronze metal and then across the way another ramp  that rises up to meet a small upper platform area and there appears to be a door  on the opposite side  laura can i do an arcana check or something to see if its magic  matt if youd like to youd probably have to get a little closer into the room to check it out  because you /none/ guys are at the outskirts of it youre just able to see a little bit of the edge  of your visual distance  marisha how big is the door  matt looking at the door if you open it up its about two inches thick  liam pike keyleth will you come up here were a little out of our depths here this seems suspect  to me id like you to both have a look  marisha yeah somethings going on here  ashley yeah  marisha so pike and i are going up  ashley yeah  /none/ laura go tell us whats up  matt have you guys all moved up to the door at least or are you all still back in the corridor  sam and taliesin im moving up to the door  laura im stepping a little back  matt okay cassandra does say this is as far as ive gone down here  laura do you know whats on the other side  matt i assume the project the last time i came here i was following the briarwoods at a  distance they went in there with a handful of guards /none/ and when i made it to this door it was  empty on the inside i assume they traveled through that far door but i have not actually  been here myself it was at that point that i was discovered and dragged back to the castle  taliesin did you make it to the acid pits  matt back that way i saw them from a distance i did not want to get too close theyre just  larger stone troughs that these chemicals have been refined in and for whatever purpose theyve  required them have been kept /none/ there dr ripley actually was in charge of a lot of that  development and creation  marisha percy and cassandra does this material mean anything to you the bronze does it keep any  type of energy out why build a room out of bronze  liam thats a question for you as well percival  taliesin i dont know i would like to get a better look are there markings on the walls is  there any scripting  matt make a perception check  taliesin get that out of the way nine  matt okay as you /none/ step into the room and look along the walls at the top of the ramp that leads  downward theres no discerning features that you can glance off visually across the walls hammered  bronze with bronze bars across to keep all the various plates that were put up together its not  one solid piece its multiple sheets that were all bolted and put together  to create solid walls  marisha and the floor is bronze  matt the floor is bronze as well  taliesin the roof  matt the roof is not bronze the roof is /none/ what looks like solid whitestone  sam that dont look good  liam pike keyleth do you make anything of this  travis anyone want to go touch a wall  marisha i dont even know  liam you have no knowledge of  marisha im not great with magic im great with nature and im not great with dungeoneering or  anything like that either can i do some sort of nature check to see if this is a quarry that we  just walked into  laura a conductor  marisha a conductor yeah its not really a /none/ nature thing though  matt make an intelligence check  marisha okay not my forte oh natural 20  laura thats a beautiful thing  matt okay this bronzecolored material and youre not too familiar with a lot of metals but  it appears to be an alloy of some kind it would probably be a good conductor of electricity if  utilized in a way for whatever purpose youre unable to ascertain but this metal is not  indigenous to this region meaning the whole area of taldorei this metal is usually imported from  distant lands it is /none/ not found or created naturally in this area to your knowledge  marisha and would i gather any information on the purpose of this room and what its used for  matt not with your experience no gathering about though as you all gather in this area and  are looking around you notice that the stonework on the ceiling has two discolorations across the  top of the ramp above you there is a oneinch discoloration almost like theres a drawn line  across the stone at that height and this lack of light cant tell if its just /none/ a marking or an  actual change in material and theres one on the other side of the room across the way at  the top of the other ramp  laura its a conductor room  marisha oh were too far away to see what its made out of  matt at this distance and in this low light its hard to tell you can see that theres a  discoloration or change but it is a consistent band across the top  sam should we send some light up there  laura how high are the ceilings  /none/ travis i have darkvision at a range of 60 feet can i see it  matt what darkvision is its very black and white you dont see a lot of color and its hard  at this distance to make out anything without feeling it or seeing it its hard to get  details  liam i checked the door but i didnt check anything else can i check the room for traps  matt yeah if youd like to  liam i would like to rolled a 23  matt okay as you descend the ramp keeping a very /none/ close eye on the ground around you or are you  just doing a visual scan  liam ill walk up within a foot of the first line you referenced  matt on the ceiling okay glancing about you dont notice any traps you do notice in the  center of the room the very center of the room on the floor there is a small variation in the color  you see what looks like a small almost ovaltype smooth button or some sort of a strange object  that is embedded in the floor  laura should i /none/ try to shoot it when none of us are in the room  sam i would just try to oh yeah thats interesting  laughter  liam that will probably tell us what this room is about i worry a little about alerting people on  the other side of the room but it feels dangerous to go through here  travis oh man  laura thats true  marisha theres no vents theres no ventilation shaft theres nothing  travis the roof is flat or is it coned  matt the roof is flat from what you can tell /none/ its a giant box its just the walls  and the floor  travis whitestone ceiling  matt the whitestone ceiling and the rest of it is all this bronze material with a ramp that goes  down towards the bottom and the ramp that goes on the other end with the two platforms where you  enter and where the other door across the way is  laura so can we clear out and ill try to shoot it  marisha sure  taliesin see what happens  laura okay ill do that  matt so all of you /none/ step back out into the hallway your cluster of percys and cassandras  liam i step one foot behind cassandra number two  matt all right go ahead and pull your arrow you aim carefully from just outside the doorway  marisha youve got this  laura do i add my attack to it  matt yes you add your attack bonus  laura 27  matt 27 so you release the arrow perfect hit on point it strikes whatever this strange object  is embedded in the floor it hits and slightly ricochets and splinters as an arrow would /none/ when it  hits a hard surface no seeming reaction  laura it did nothing  taliesin im going to try something first of all does the construct of this at all remind me  of anything  matt no actually most of this tunnel structure did not exist when you lived here this has all  been either rediscovered or created since you left whitestone  taliesin im going to take my sword and im going to go into the room and im going to lay my sword  on the ground copper is a conductor im having that /none/ thought im going to try and slide my sword  towards the center of the room and see if i can cause a short with the piece of metal and get a  positive and negative charge to hit and see if i can get a reaction  matt all righty as you step down to the bottom of the slope as it meets the bottom and there is  an open area in the center of the floor now about a 20foot area width between the two ramps youre  now at the bottom of the ramp you take /none/ the sword and you let it scatter across and there are  imperfections in the floor so it skips as it moves and such and eventually slides to a stop no  effect but you do get a better look at what this thing is embedded in the floor you not having  darkvision though you would have to have a light source for this  taliesin i had a torch  matt yeah you bring your torch forward and you look over it looks like a smooth gem like an  opal or some sort of whitish opaque gem /none/ that is embedded in the ground in the center  laura the arkenstone definitely  laughter  taliesin and its not translucent its like an opallike stone  matt its an opallike stone about that big that is embedded in the bronze floor theres actually  a small metal bronze band that encases it wraps around it that it wasnt just pressed into it it  was put there intentionally  travis i say we smash it  taliesin i say we remove it at the very least see what happens  laura can you disarm it  marisha all /dung/ of those sound like bad ideas  sam terrible  taliesin does anybody have a good idea  sam why dont we just walk past it  marisha im with scanlan i say we just go  taliesin in the absence of good ideas bad ideas i think are always reasonable  marisha but maybe mine and scanlans is a good idea  laura maybe just try to get through the room some of us stay on one side some other people go  through and see what happens to the first person  liam so long as you all /none/ will pick me up off the floor i would like to skirt the entire side of  the room  laura and just go through the other door  liam see if i can make it to the other door  matt all right  liam please help me if i fall down and i start along  travis after a good giggle  matt as the floor ramps down towards the center you follow it along the wall making your way  across looking you notice as you go across the wall there are three more of these same /none/ opal  stones embedded in the wall about shoulder height  liam in the wall  matt in the wall as you go across  liam is it one in the middle and then one in the center of each wall  matt on just on your wall  liam just on my wall  matt just on your wall theres three along the way theres one in the center of the room in line  with the central opal and theres two to the sides of it about four feet from each other  liam ive gone into a /none/ crouch so im very low butt dragging along the floor and just sort of  matt so you notice that you skirt underneath  liam leaning my back against the wall  matt okay they pass overhead as you make your way underneath the three opals in this part of the  wall making your way up the other ramp to the other side  liam continued perception check  matt make a perception check  liam yeah 23  matt okay you make your way up this side looking about on the floor nothing seems to happen  nothing /none/ catches your eye you get onto this upper platform and there is the door there  in front of you  liam i check for traps on the door that is a 24  matt the door does not appear to be trapped  liam or locked  matt does not appear to be locked it does not seem to have a mechanism for opening other than if  you wanted to try and push  travis go through it  sam no lets get out of here they wouldnt build a huge bronze trap room within their castle  /none/ no theyve lived here in peace for five years what would they need this for this has some sort  of use for their magic this is not a trap room  travis we should try to remove one of the stones  marisha question are the stones mathematically adjacent to each other  do they appear to be lined up  matt well as you can tell theres the one in the center of the middle of the floor then theres  one on the wall that he walked across and as you to the other wall there are /none/ another  matching set of three on both walls  marisha and theyre all lined up  matt and theyre all lined up theres the two in the center of the room that match the one in the  floor and then theres one to each side of that about four feet apart  marisha okay im going to walk in a little bit are there any on the ceiling  matt looking up make a perception check  marisha natural one  matt you get lost in the beauty of the structure  laughter  taliesin i was going /none/ to look to see if there was one matching the one on the floor  matt okay  marisha thats good metal good craftsmanship damn  taliesin yeah thats good thats a 27  matt looking up no the ceiling is just smooth whitestone you pushing the door it doesnt  open it is solid stone and as you push and look you can see theres no hinges looking at where it  meets the wall it looks like it slid down into a groove its actually a door that would lift or  sink it slides some way shape /none/ or form it slides into place  liam grog doesnt have an earring does he  travis yeah i do  marisha i think we all have earrings right now  liam grog  laura hes right there just fucking talk to him  liam hes across an 80foot room im not going to shout down here theres a big heavy thing  travis yeah  liam and youre the best you are at what you do do you think you could shimmy along on your tummy  along a side wall dont stand up because theres gems in the /none/ walls along the way and i dont know  what they do so stay low please and come meet me up here  travis i just kinda want to walk across the room  laura do it  travis i walk across the room  matt okay so you watch in horror as grog just strolls full upright back hammer in his arm with  a big grin on his face looking like a really burly percy i have to keep reminding myself its  a very curious visual every time  travis i adjust my amazing spectacles  matt /none/ passes right through the center of where these opals are aligned across from each other  seeming no effect makes his way up the ramp to where you are on the opposite side of the room  taliesin im going to go get my sword  marisha well hang on while grog goes and lifts the thing while grog does that do i have any  idea where we are geographically in the city underground  matt keeping track best you can you gather youre about a quartermile from the center of the  city from the square where the /none/ sun tree is its a quartermile south of you  marisha so probably not under the sun tree  matt currently no  marisha okay  travis walking up to the door does it look like i can get any purchase with my little  fingerbits  matt nope it is flush with the ground  travis i have a pickaxe that i picked up before we left  matt okay  travis can i swing it at the bottom and try and find some purchase under the door  matt you could try yeah go ahead go ahead and /none/ roll an athletics check to see if you can manage  to get anything in there  travis okay 16  matt 16 okay so you take it and you try to get a few whacks in its not really getting in there  make a strength check  travis shit fuck nine  matt nine you swing with the pickaxe downward for a full angry grogswing and as you hit you  feel the pickaxe move further than it did before and for a splitsecond your brains like great  and then you look down and notice that the /none/ actual handle of the pickaxe has shattered from the  impact broken in two  taliesin were not thinking about this clearly  travis thinking  sam weve been beaten by doors before but goddamn it were not going to be beaten today i  go to the center of the room and i find that little button thing and im going to press it  taliesin good  matt okay you go and press your thumb down on it it doesnt move it doesnt shift it doesnt  give way at all it just stays in place as you /none/ pull your thumb away though you notice that the  gem has a very soft faint white glow to it and a second after you pull your thumb  away it fades back  taliesin i walk over to the wall and touch one of the other gems  laura i touch another one  marisha i touch another one  matt you guys all place your hands against the opals on the sides and checking as you pull your  hand away the opals glow brightly white again and then fade  marisha pike  travis i am captain /none/ planet no  laura touch one of the stones grog  travis i run over and touch a stone  liam i touch one too  matt laughs all right so thats three on one side three on the other whos got the middle  one you got the middle one  sam im in the middle  ashley i got one  laura trinket  sam yeah can trinket touch a stone or cassandra cassandra make yourself useful for  christs sake  liam whos christ  sam my friend back in gnomolia where im from  matt pike /none/ are you grabbing a stone or not  ashley what was that  matt are you touching a stone or not  ashley yes i am  matt okay thats seven so three on one side three on the other trinket keeping there with  anticipation up next to you pike you put your hand on the final stone a moment passes  laura this is totally going to work  marisha come on guys  matt doesnt seem to have an immediate effect  sam wait  marisha no maybe if we all think about the strength of our /none/ friendship and bond together  liam this is our time now  sam hold on as much as i love pike you arent a real person right now  maybe we should swap out pike  matt yeah pike as you pull your hand away the stone is glowing and it fades momentarily after  you put your hand there  sam oh it does work never mind pike i love you  ashley but are there any on the ceiling  matt nothing on the ceiling  laura do we see any missing ones  matt roll a perception /none/ check  laura 21  matt 21 okay looking about cassandra actually whos up towards the far ramp seems to notice  something and walks up to where the door is looking at the foot of the door she moves her  hand out of the way and presses her hand down on a hidden eighth opal  laura nice  matt at which point theres a shift a sound of stone shifting loudly and those bars across the  ceiling the green bars let loose a bit of dust and two large walls of green glass impact noise  /none/ slam downward to the front and back of you locking all seven of you into the center of this  bronze room  liam wheres cassandra  matt cassandras on the other side of the green wall on the far end of the room  marisha can we hear each other through the glass  matt cassandra runs up to the glass and puts her hands to it and you can hear her voice saying  is everyone all right  laura is she on the other side of it  matt she went up to the far platform which /none/ by the way you notice immediately this glass this  weird warped glass that forms these walls is the same material as the shards of green glass  that you found broken on parts of the ground in the undercroft  sam grog can you hit it  travis yeah anybody have any objections  all no  travis i swing away  matt okay cassandra takes a step back go ahead and roll for an attack  laura is the door opening behind her  matt the door is opening actually behind her  travis 19  matt 19 /none/ you go ahead and you strike forward go ahead and roll damage  travis 16  matt 16 okay you strike with all your might across the front of the glass cassandra steps  back as the might of it hits a streak of green sparks fly off the edge of the blade as it careens  across the front and goes metal noises leaving bare but a scratch across the stone at this  point you guys see the door opening behind cassandra and two figures step in behind her  laura goddamn it  marisha im going to /none/ go ahead and cast thunderwave maybe this shit can only be taken  down with magic  sam wait but are you going to hurt us  laura i dip my arrows in holy oil three of them  marisha no its just a push spell but its radiant damage thing but you guys  are behind the glass  travis were all in the glass  laura were all in the glass  travis no were in a closed space  sam were all going to get hit by what youre doing  marisha well if it breaks the /none/ glass we wont be separated by glass  travis might as well die one way or another  marisha you wanted me to try and get us  laura just do it  liam while all this is happening i pull the vial of poison that i traded from that hag and start to  drip it down onto my blade of lifestealing behind the group  matt okay as you guys all gather back and up at this point grog i dont know if youre still  swinging  travis oh yeah im just angry noises  matt as /none/ this is happening are you preparing thunderwave you said you wanted to try  laura do it you said you wanted to do it just do it  marisha all right i take my staff crack it down cast thunderwave  see if i can shatter this glass  matt with a loud soundblast echoing through the room you can hear the reverberation of the actual  bronze material sending back the vibrations of this spell all of you who werent covering your  ears very heartily it still creeps through and rings your head a little bit as the /none/ blast hits  the glass it seems to have no effect the actual essence of the spell itself is scattered across  its surface this residuumsealed green glass the two figures step into what little bit of light is  now visible from percys torch that is twisted through the warped surface of this glass wall and  you see before you lord and lady briarwood stepping up to the wall looking through their  warped visage through the glass looking down into the chamber that youre all currently locked in  laura oh is this your room i didnt /none/ even realize we were in your house right now how good  to see you again darling  matt sylas leans forward and puts his hand to the glass and says and hello to you too and  welcome to all of you well my dear  at which point delilah steps forward and goes i was hoping for a more formal reunion but you  insisted on riling up the populace and tying up the bulk of our forces  rather unfortunate really  liam now the doors open behind them right if i use perception do i see /none/ anything behind them  any switch or lever or anything  matt go ahead and make a perception check  liam 20  matt 20 looking across the way but barely able to peer past them with very little light in the  distortion of the glass you can see what seems to be some sort of a smooth stone placard thats  embedded in the wall just on the other side of the door  liam just outside the door  matt yeah  liam then i pull the cape around me and i dimension door  sam what /none/  liam outside that door right by the placard and jam my hand on that  matt okay  sam you can do that  matt you all of a sudden vanish from that room and you press your hand into that placard you can  notice sylas looks over his shoulder with a slight look of unexpected surprise the smiles  still across his face  marisha can i go ahead and start conjuring sunbeam  matt thats if you want to its a spell that you do as you do it  you cant really hold it in /none/ place  marisha okay  matt you pressed the platform in  skype noise  marisha no  travis keep going  matt as you push in theres a sound of grinding stone again however the walls stay in place two  of the highest bronze plates that are pressed against the wall shift inside and move out of the  way and two big tubes push outward sylas looks over his shoulder and says well i was not  expecting you to want to see your friends dissolved quite so quickly but certainly  laura oh my god were /none/ going to die  matt as you guys look up this green viscous liquid begins to pour  taliesin i stop i pull out the gun and the second those hit ive seen this coming because  fucking copper room fucking acid ice shot to the one tube do my best to reload as quickly as i can  and ice shot to the other im going to try and clog them with ice at least temporarily  matt okay go ahead and make your first shot  taliesin thats 15 27  matt 27 okay  taliesin to hit /none/ and thats ten plus three points of ice damage  matt okay the bullet slams into the bottom of this tube and the tube itself is not made of any  real thick material its a similar material to the bronze the rest of this room is constructed  in and it seems like its brought in by some sort of mechanism that locks into place as the bullet  strikes the bottom of it it bends upward closing off part of its passageway and locking off the  other half with ice seemingly holding it for the time being /none/ while youre reloading i need you to  go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw  liam i have advantage  matt you do  travis what about these jewels  matt the feast gives you advantage  liam the feast gives me advantage well but it doesnt stack right i rolled a 16  matt you rolled a 16 all right  taliesin it was a good thought  matt as you pull your hand out of the switch sylass gaze pierces into your eyes and your  blades before you have a moment to notice have already /none/ sheathed themselves and you step into the  room alongside the two of them  travis the jewels it was what lowered the glass break the jewels  matt sylas comes and pats you on the shoulder and goes however it doesnt hurt to have friends  thankfully we were ahead of our residuum production schedule and well a few minor  modifications to our distillery room made an excellent trap for you  delilah turns to him and says bit unceremonious but im not in the mood to break a  sweat today were still weeks off from being /none/ ready and i have much work to do at which  point they both look over and put their hands on cassandra cassandras still standing there  staring at the room with a look of coldness mixed with this brimming sense of desperation and worry  theres this crux moment in her where theres this inner conflict within her right now  travis can i take a swing at the jewel that i was holding my hand over  taliesin i want to get my second  matt quickly hes going to get his next shot here  taliesin reload /none/ second shot 15  matt 15 as you fire the second it ricochets off the bronze nearby the liquid begins to pour in  now one side is currently held but the other half spills and begins cascading into the room  laura i drink my potion of flying that i took from ripley  matt okay you chug a potion of flying and you begin lifting off the ground the rest of you you  do have these two ramps that push up at least five feet towards where these glass walls are but the  bottom of this /none/ entire room is beginning to fill with this liquid  marisha can i go ahead and on my im assuming i have spigots in my room were each in individual  rooms with our own spigots  matt no youre all in the same room sealed by two walls  laura thats why the thunderwave hit us all because were all in one giant room together  marisha okay  taliesin and all the gems are in our room correct  matt correct yes all the gems except for the one that cassandra touched  taliesin yeah  travis can /none/ i hit the fucking jewel  laura do it  sam yeah do it  travis can i try  matt yep  travis 18  matt okay you reach down and strike the gem go ahead and roll damage  travis no fire damage so 15  matt 15 okay you strike the gem as hard as you can you can see it crack a little bit from the  impact the actual gem itself has a small crack run through its center are you guys all currently  at the top of the ramps  laura were backing /none/ up to where were not in the middle of the acid  matt is what im asking yeah trinkets backed up awkwardly against the back looking really  uncomfortable cassandra puts her hand up to the wall and looks at the group of you and says  which one is my percy  taliesin i walk up i look at her and i smile its all right see you soon and going to go  right into pulling out the gun and preparing  laura preparing what  taliesin were going to take out these gems  laura okay  /none/ taliesin were going to be fine but we have to do it now  marisha while they take out the gems these earrings work telepathically right  matt no you actually talk into them and it happens  marisha okay im going to back into the corridor while you guys handle the gems and start talking  to vax  matt theres no corridor youre inside  marisha or the ramp whatever  matt okay youre backing up on the ramp as youre doing that  taliesin im going to be fine go  matt she leans forward with her /none/ hand on the wall and looks at you in the eyes you can see theres  tears running down her face and she says your sister left us the day those arrows found my  chest i did not die from those wounds but to watch you leave me there in the snow i have a new  family i am a briarwood and i have a destiny with the whispered one she steps back as the two  briarwoods put their arms around your sister and even still theres a shake to her voice and you  can see /none/ in her eyes theres a quake she speaks words of conviction but you know deep inside  even theres conflict  at which point delilah kisses her on the head and says dont worry my dear itll be over soon  and they turn around and step into the hallway they entered from  liam one question and im assuming im gone but in combat i would be able to roll a wisdom save  every six seconds right  matt no for this you are technically charmed for 24 hours  liam 24 hours  marisha can i start /none/ talking to vax over the comms  travis can i hit the gem please  matt all right  laura can i hunters mark them  matt you could attempt to  laura im going to attempt to  matt okay you go to attempt hunters mark and as the energy springs forth from your hand it hits  the green wall and scatters across the arcane nature of the spell halted immediately  laura yeah figured as much  matt now at this point as youre going for the nearest gem on the wall  travis yeah the same /none/ one i had before that cracked a little  matt okay so go ahead and take another shot  travis 21  matt all right you strike down and slam it go ahead and roll damage  sam its one on the wall yeah  travis yeah same one i hit before 15 again no fire damage  matt okay you strike the gem this time the gem shatters pieces of it go flying out of the area  and parts of it turn to dust and chunks hit and roll down into the acid the acid which now is /none/  about a foot and half two feet high and is slowly rising in the room  laura oh god  sam i step into the acid  matt okay  sam and i start hitting the one in the center with my fucking stupid sword  laura i shoot my exploding arrow at the glass  matt at the glass okay  sam okay big arrow  laura its an exploding arrow  matt you guys watch vax turn around and begin to follow the briarwoods  marisha i start talking to vax vax its kiki dont forget who /none/ you are you are stronger than  this you are stronger than them you are not a briarwood you are vox machina and we cant lose  you i cant lose you  sam what was that  marisha youre our only hope please you can overcome this please  matt scanlan make an attack roll  sam 18 plus something i dont know how to hit things  matt okay go ahead and roll your damage with the sword  sam is that a d20 no it says 1d8 plus three okay thats not much  laura its something /none/ its something  travis can pike do something  matt if pike wants to yeah you guys are all together still  travis pike do some cool shit  sam 11  ashley im halfway here this stupid astral projection is driving me nuts  matt oh no  sam 11  matt as you wade into the acid you feel the sting as it hits your body you immediately take five  points of acid damage  sam i have a potion of acid resistance that i drank  matt you did so you take three three points of /none/ acid damage and you strike down arcing down as  it splashes parts of it go across your face you can feel the tingle of it burn the outside of your  skin but not enough to really cause any serious damage  sam not the face  matt but you strike down and you find it hit the gem and then slide off as it hits but you feel it  give a bit on the impact anyone else want to do anything right now  laura i was going to shoot the exploding arrow at the glass door /none/  matt all right go ahead and roll the attack  laura i did and it was 22  matt 22 all right you release the arrow it streaks across the room hits the glass and it  explodes with a reverberating crack you guys all in the middle of trying to figure out this  scenario didnt cover your ears in time and it nearly deafens you from the blast of the impact  from the reverberation of the room however go ahead and roll damage on that roll arrow damage  and then an additional 4d6 points of /none/ damage  laura oh shit that wouldve been so good to have on them im sorry  sam as my bonus action i turn to percy and i say percy were surrounded by metal and glass  and stone above us is there anything we can do to that stone  taliesin whitestones pretty strong  sam cant it burn cant you do things with stone keyleth  travis you have lightning are we going to kill ourselves if we do that  taliesin you could stone you could get out of this  matt so whats the damage on /none/ that  laura i know  marisha i couldnt take move earth because we needed sunbeam i have wall of stone  sam what does that do  travis it could buy us more time if we get on it  laura 43  matt 43 it hits the glass and as the explosion settles the smoke rises up and you can see a  portion of the glass wall about ten feet up shards have been chiseled out from the explosion  its taken some damage not a heavy amount but you can see there has been a portion /none/ of the wall  that has been scraped away  travis about ten feet up  matt about ten feet up  laura grog  travis can i run over there id have to run through the acid  matt you would have to yeah unless you want to try and jump across you could try and jump across  if you want to  travis yes i would like to jump across run over and start swinging on that section  matt okay  sam what side is this on the ceiling  laura this is on the side /none/ that they left through  sam okay  matt which the door is now closed by the way and vax is nowhere in sight  laura the door closed again  travis can i do great weapon master and hit it three times  matt yeah  travis yeah  matt scanlan are you making another strike at the gem  sam absolutely is it my turn again  matt this is all fluid well pull it up as you go and youre taking your shot  taliesin im taking three shots at one of the gems on the wall /none/  matt okay go for it  sam 17 to hit  matt hits go ahead and roll damage  sam ten  matt ten you strike down a second time the acid now beginning to rise the levels almost up to  your chest and its a little harder for you to swing but you still manage to strike true you  take four points of acid damage but you can feel the damage itself is mounting its growing with  each progressive amount of you that is currently submerged you strike down thankfully the liquid  isnt too /none/ thick and you still manage to push through most of your force your magical blade  guiding it down to the gem and you feel it crack beneath you crack and shatter  sam one down  matt one down  taliesin we have two down  matt oh sorry two down between the two of you  marisha do there appear to be any weak points in the metal anywhere  matt not that you can tell at a quick glance everythings pretty solid and its been used  multiple times and you see now that this room is /none/ used and what they used to melt down all the  whitestone into the residuum component during the construction of the ziggurat some of the  notes mentioned it ripley mentioned a little bit but this this is bad  sam acid melts whitestone  matt it appears to yeah  sam the whitestone on the ceiling  marisha the acid thats filling in melts that okay well that changes things does my control  water spell would that work with the acid  matt theres such a little water component that that spell is used to focusing on it /none/ would be a  little hard for you to do that in enough of amount to actually do any serious effect unfortunately  laura does the acid go through glass  taliesin no glass is specifically how you contain acid  laura can i take one of my glass vials that i have and try to get some acid and put it up on the  ceiling  matt you can definitely fill it up but its a ways up  laura im flying  matt oh yeah  sam youre flying  laura i took a flying potion to /none/ get out of the acid  matt so you bolt down and its still pouring in the ice on the other side by the way shatters as  it now continues to pour in from both sides doubling the speed at which its filling  taliesin im taking my three shots at the next gem  matt go for it  laura am i high enough that i can see where the pipes are coming in at  matt yeah  laura so i could potentially grab hold of one of the pipes on the ceiling and try to move /none/ it  matt you could yeah  laura i want to try to grab hold of one of those pipes and aim it toward the ceiling  if i can move it  matt okay well get to that in just a moment  taliesin the first one was 21  matt okay  taliesin and then the second shot dear god it hits  marisha he rolled an 18  taliesin 18 20 30  matt all right  taliesin third shot is 26  matt all right all three hit roll damage for all of those  taliesin /none/ thats 14  matt okay  taliesin 11 for the second shot and 14 for the third shot  matt all right three gun blasts you unload three bullets in a row you see before even the  last one hits the opal itself crash shatters off from the final blast leaving the vacuous hole  where it once was embedded in the wall vex you move up and you grab onto it you begin to try and  shove it and even with your fly spell you dont have a lot of weight behind it so you put  /none/ yourself up against the wall find some leverage against one of the metal bars that holds the metal  plates in place and you lift i need you to make a strength check  laura im the weakest  liam not this time  laura do i get advantage  matt not for this you dont  laura damn it  marisha can i help her out  laura get those boots of levitation get them on fly up because i just rolled a fucking zero  literally a zero  matt you grab it and as youre holding onto /none/ it its pliable its not a very hard metal but you  just dont have the strength physically in this one attempt to bend it in any way  shape or form  laura can i use my dagger that i have  marisha hold on use your dagger and seeing what shes doing im going to cast my heat metal spell  on it and start heating and melting it  laura the pipe  marisha yeah  matt so you reach over and cast heat metal the pipe section sticks out about two and a half feet  /none/ from this point so you can grasp it there you look over and see the metal itself beginning to  heat up beginning to glow  laura can i try to lift it  matt you can  laura i wrap my hands in cloth and then i do it  matt okay so you take your cloak and wrap it up good call what are you doing  sam i say to everybody when cassandra put her hand on the hidden gem outside the glass it  closed the doors right  laura yeah  sam if i put /none/ my hands on that while youre putting your hands on the inside gems it might  open the doors right  laura potentially but we destroyed them  marisha we destroyed two  sam yeah but maybe if we do the other ones it would still work is it worth a shot  laura can you dimension door  sam i could  travis can you take some people with you  sam no i can take pike  laura take pike  matt you can take one person  sam of my height  matt of your size medium /none/ creatures  sam oh my size not my height  matt well you are as a gnome a small creature arent you  laura but hes percysized right now  matt pretty sure  taliesin well its fake though  laura oh right  matt let me doublecheck this real fast yeah a gnomes considered small so it would have to be a  small creature for you  sam i can take pike  ashley all right lets go  laura do it  sam wait no  laura just try it  sam theres four of us in /none/ here and four gems left  marisha how many gems are left inside  taliesin four but it could be that thats the only gem thats necessary  sam or i could go outside the stone door and see if theres any more buttons out there to press  marisha i think going outside is a good idea go outside  matt grog do you want to make your strikes  sam pike shall i take you with me  ashley yes lets go  laura go  sam the best thing ive ever heard you and me in a /none/ room alone together  travis 13 17 and 13  matt first two hit  travis no it was 15 20 and 23 on the hits that was the damage  matt that was for the damage oh got you so as you slam into it and slam into it with each  progressive hit you can see the glass itself is gliding off the blade youre doing bits of  damage but its going to take you a while you could get through this in about ten minutes but  right now the acid has lifted to the point /none/ where the next round everyones going to start being  submerged  sam i take pike by the hands and i will dimension door out through the glass to where she put her  hand on the hidden gem is that right  matt okay you step out of the acid its dripping off the lower half of your body this  sizzling smoke is pouring off your body  sam my leather pants are singed  laughter  matt dont lenny kravitz this you walk up the ramp you grab pike and the two of you appear on  /none/ the other side of the glass door up on the platform where cassandra pressed the final gem  sam pike nows a good time to talk about us dont you think no ill just put  my hand on the gem  ashley scanlan not now  sam okay  matt you put your hand on the gem and put your hand away for a second and see the gem itself is  glowing but does not seem to be  sam try to put your hands on the other nondestroyed gems  matt make another strength check now with /none/ the heat metal  laura okay  travis im running over to the other gems  marisha come on vex  laura thats way better 13  matt 13 okay with the help of the heat metal which managed to make the metal more pliable you  do still take three points of fire damage because the metal itself is burning and youre putting  your weight against it and pushing against the edge of the wall but you pull it up and it  begins arcing upward and you push it over in the direction of the wall where /none/ he is  laura yeah at the ceiling  matt yeah there is force just pushing it outward as it arcs over it starts splattering  across the whitestone on the ceiling as it hits the whitestone dissolves and you can see its  causing these huge pockmarks in the actual stone above the glass  sam do that more  laura i keep doing it  marisha im going to switch my heat metal spell over to the other spigot  laura and i fly over to the other side and do the same thing  matt okay its /none/ not hitting the whole ceiling you could probably take another round to keep  directing it if you want to its up to you you could either keep directing this one because  right now its just starting to hit the ceiling  laura ill keep directing it  matt okay moving it over there what are you doing  travis im running over to the gem  sam put your hands on the gems  taliesin im running over to a gem  matt okay you guys make your attacks on separate gems  travis no were going to /none/ put our hands on the gem right  matt youre putting hands on it  taliesin im going to handson and see if anything happens and if nothing does im going  to pull out my sword and start whacking it  matt okay you guys run up and put your hands on the gems  sam can they get two gems each  matt theyve both gotten two gems each yeah  sam and my hand is on  matt on the bottom gem  sam come on work damn it  matt you could yeah you could probably /none/ get one gem theres only four gems left  sam could trinket do the other one wheres trinket  matt trinket is up against the wall on the sides very scared right now  sam and taliesin we need a fourth hand  marisha oh okay still keeping my heat metal spell up  matt you place all of your hands on the gems no apparent effect  marisha fuck  taliesin i pull out my sword and start whacking it  travis fuck you gem  matt make another strength check  laura shitballs were going to die  /none/ liam guys the briarwoods personal quarters are really plush theyre sick  laura laughs i rolled a zero  matt you rolled zero again  laughter  matt you cant quite move the metal enough this time its still arcing and its spattering  against the glass no effect on the glass but its starting to hit elements of the ceiling you  can see the stone is being eaten away at this point everyone whos currently on the ground  suffers three points of acid damage as its now beginning to reach up to your shins  you take /none/ two  sam no im out  matt i forgot youre outside youre fine pike you dont because you and scanlan are outside of  the room  travis and im resistant  matt yeah so you take two  sam pike my love is there any way you can get to the other side of this stone wall to see whats  over there  taliesin break your gem  sam break my gem  taliesin the outside gem break the outside gem  matt you hear percy yelling from the other side  taliesin shouting break the outside /none/ gem  sam all i hear is muffled noises  taliesin muffled just fucking break the gem  laura break the outside gem  sam i think percy wants us to kiss pike  taliesin muffled kiss no i just want you to break the goddamn thing  sam he said the power of love will inspire him  taliesin muffled fuck the power of love  laughter  ashley i take my hand and i guiding bolt the top of the gem  matt okay roll a spell attack or for guiding bolt is it a saving throw  /none/ ashley one more time sorry i cant hear you very well  matt i cant remember if its a saving throw or not for guiding bolt let me check  laura maybe you could hit it with a mace pike  matt guiding bolt yeah make a ranged spell attack with advantage because its right in  front of your hand  ashley okay  matt so roll two d20s take the higher of the two and add your spell attack modifier  liam cold as ice mercer  taliesin laughs  travis were hitting gems too  ashley 16 /none/  sam what did you say ashley  ashley 16  sam she said 16  matt 16 yeah thats easy enough roll your damage for your guiding bolt its 4d6 radiant  damage  laura 4d6  ashley okay  taliesin im hitting my gem too  matt okay roll damage  laura im trying really hard to lift this pipe with my scrawny little arms  matt make another strength check  travis 17  laura oh no  matt glass breaking noise your gem shatters  taliesin i rolled a 30 to hit  matt yeah that /none/ hits  laura 12 for strength  matt 12 for strength you manage to move it to the side you take two points of fire damage as  the heat from the actual metal itself is starting to push through the leather and you can feel it  burning the edge of your skin  laura okay  matt but you do arc it over a little further and its now splatter noise pouring onto the ceiling  and splashing over and down over the glass wall you can see the stonework is melting through and  after a few /dung/ seconds of this you begin to see the top of where the glass wall ends  sam get over it  matt as the wall dissipates and the acid begins to push through the rest of the whitestone you  guys look up and you can see the ceiling above you begin to turn dark for a second before part begins  to dripping noises drip acid into the small chamber that the two of you  currently are standing in  ashley total of 20  matt total of 20 damage yeah the gem on the ground before you /none/ glass breaking noise shatters  with a blast of radiant energy  sam and does the stone door behind us open  matt you still have one more gem left its the one you were touching  laura oh we have another gem hit it  marisha the one i was touching  matt what are you doing keyleth  marisha im going to put my hand on it and do  sam squeeze gem  marisha im going to do another thunderwave bam see if i can thunderwave crack it  taliesin these things are really easy to kill /none/  laura yeah thats a lot of energy  matt roll damage on the thunderwave  marisha they get killed by not a lot or a lot  taliesin they get killed by hitting them with your fist  travis or your staff  marisha 11 points of damage  matt 11 points of damage okay thunderwave explosion noise resounds off and you see the  gem crack in place but its still held in its current position in the wall  travis hit it  laura hit it with your staff  matt at this point in time as /none/ you guys finish this the ceiling begins to open into a tunnel  above you and acid begins to fill the room that both of you guys are in  sam me and pike  matt yeah both of you guys  taliesin did i finish killing my gem  matt you did yes  taliesin okay im going to take a shot if i have anything else to do can i take a shot at the  gem that she just cracked  matt yep  laura does it look like a big enough tunnel now that i can /none/ move the pipe  matt right now a person could climb through over top of the green wall  sam a goliath  laura and a bear  matt at this point the way youve been leaning over and it is slopping over you could probably  squeeze them through a bear youd have to push winnie the poohstyle but its doable  taliesin 18  matt 18 hits yeah  taliesin thats 16 points of damage  matt shattering noise the last gem shatters from the blast of the gun pieces of the opal  scatter across your face /none/ keyleth not enough to cut you at which point the green stone wall  behind you scraping noise lifts up revealing the room behind you the one in front of you tries  to lift up and is caught because currently part of the stone that lifts it up has been dissolved  sam laughs were smart  matt pike and scanlan you guys currently in that room suffer three points of acid damage as  your side of the room is now filling up with acid  laura dimension door out again  sam three points mines halved right /none/ so its two  matt yeah  marisha okay out of frustration i see this can i do a wall of stone from underneath the glass to  try and lift it up  matt yeah okay go ahead and roll a d20 and add your wisdom check  marisha not great oh i get advantage on wisdom right  matt its not a wisdom save  marisha fucking shit balls wisdom just wisdom  matt just wisdom  marisha eight  matt eight you use your wall of stone spell you feel there is the stone surface beneath the /none/  bronze you can sense as the stone begins to push up from the whitestone beneath the bronze plates  and it impact noise hits and its not strong enough to force its way through both the bronze  plating and the wall itself  marisha bye 5thlevel spell  travis can we lower a rope and get over the glass now that theres a little space  laura yeah  matt roll a strength check to try to bend it away if you want to  marisha ive still got that heat metal up  laura nine  matt /none/ with the heat metal  marisha its still up its a concentration spell yeah  matt you start moving it away  laura i kick it with my foot to move it out of the way  matt youre pushing as hard as you can its shifting but its going to take you another round  to move it over pike and scanlan  laura im like chun lee my legs are so strong  matt you are technically thats only one point of acid damage to both of you because these d6 are  rolling crap but this is /none/ the second round because its filling up so its two of those and i  rolled a one so two points of acid but you take one because youre halved so two points of acid  damage to you pike youre now up to about waist high in this acid thats beginning to burn through  and dissolve  whos doing what now anything anyone else or are you just waiting on these guys to finish with  their actions  sam should i get out of here and try to start working on the stone  laura go on /none/ the other side so you can open up the door that leads out  taliesin wait im so sorry how far out is the acid room from where we are right now  matt you mean the room theyre in  taliesin no the room that the acid is stored in  matt you dont know actually oh you mean the one that was way back  taliesin yeah  matt that was quite a ways away  taliesin oh damn it okay  matt its probably a mile behind you  sam pike is there any way you can /dung/ get through this stone wall to the other side  to see whats there  laura oh yeah youre made of jelly can you do it  sam oh no we cant hear you  matt hold on we cant hear you  sam the darkness is consuming her  liam oh no shes muted hanging up and calling you back  matt roll a perception check  sam who me  matt yes  liam i am having some fabulous dark chocolate right now it is so good  theyre feeding it to me  matt can we hear /none/ you ashley there we go  sam four  matt okay  ashley okay  matt pike roll a perception check  ashley okay sorry guys i dont know whats going on  sam its the evil  ashley i know its the evil its so strong i rolled a 19  matt okay as the acids pouring and youre looking about you notice that the acid level  raised to a certain point and doesnt seem to be continuing actually glancing over you see the  door that the briarwoods left out of behind you is made of whitestone /none/ and the acid that has  filled this chamber which is usually sealed off by the glass wall that has now spilled over through  the ceiling has actually dissolved through the bottom of the door at this time its begun to  subside almost like the liquid thats coming through is not keeping up with the amount that is  pouring into the hallway behind you  laura thats awesome  ashley good news guys were not going to drown  matt laura make another strength check  laura okay this is the best oh four  matt okay /none/ you just cant move it at this point the heat metal has burned your arms enough to the  point where youre finding a hard time managing to keep your muscles together to move it  laura its made of metal guys  matt the doorway thats right there about waisthigh to you has completely dissolved on the  bottom  sam oh so we can swim through  matt if you want to try yeah  sam im going to do that im going to take a snorkel  matt okay in doing so scanlan you take eight points /none/ of acid damage reduced to four because of  your resistance you go through and pop out on the other side in the hallway its a stone hallway  and the acid is currently dissolving the ground below and its sinking into the ground china  syndromestyle  sam are there any buttons knobs levers  matt looking up you do see immediately to your right in the hallway there is a stone square with  a push plate  liam motherfucker  laura thats what he pushed push it  sam did i see vax push that  matt /none/ you saw vax appear behind them and push something in that direction  sam okay so i will push that  matt okay you push it as it clicks inward you hear the grinding of gears and stone and all of a  sudden the tube that youre holding shudders for a second the fluid begins to stop spewing forth  the rest of it begins to glide out eventually coming to a stop as the acid stops pouring into  the room the door that you swam under lifts up  sam guess i could have done that before /none/ sorry i wanted to wait until they were gone thats what  it was i was waiting until they were gone  matt at this point in time you see where the opals were on the sides the portions that keep  them housed slowly move into the wall leaving these holes behind them and the one in the ground  depresses and disappears as it does the acid thats in the room begins to slowly drain out  travis yes  marisha scanlan what do you see on the other side of where you are  sam i see /none/ stone acid a very handsome gnome oh wait thats me and a big button that i just  pressed  taliesin we can see you now cant we  sam oh hi see you guys you look green  laura unless its still blocking the way because the door wont open so we have to go up and over  the fucking door so thats what we have to do  travis up and over the wall  laura the glass door that is partially destroyed that wont lower  marisha we cant open the door  sam none no /none/ more buttons or levers out there nothing else  matt not currently you guys smashed everything that was in the vicinity  laura we jammed the door it wont open so theres a tunnel we can go up and over  sam all right do that  taliesin we have a rope  marisha throw a rope over to get over  matt you wait a few moments for the level to descend a little bit to the point where you can  stand comfortably without taking any acid damage as it drains over there is that portion of  /none/ ceiling now where its pockmarked and destroyed close to where the glass wall hits the ceiling  laura i use the earring and i go vax vax please that acid is filling the room were all  dying i dont know what to do  matt as youre walking alongside the briarwoods into a new chamber you hear the words hit your  ear and you can feel the back of your throat choking up as a part of you is urging you to run  back and as you stop instinctively in your step the rest of the group /none/ walks ahead about ten feet  before sylas looks over his shoulder and says keep up please theres work to be done at  which point you feel yourself just continue stepping forward and catching up to him because  you wouldnt want to make sylas angry  travis purple man  marisha yeah i was just going to say fucking fuck you david tennant  laughter  travis weve got to get out of this room  laura yeah up and over lets go  matt all right how are you guys getting over through  taliesin and marisha /none/ rope  laura i have the robe of infinite ropeness  matt okay so you take a few times you want to just throw the rope over you could however you  want to get the rope up and over the area it takes a few tries but you get it  on the other side  laura im flying  matt oh yeah youre flying you just drop it over its fine well say for the sake of  brevity a few minutes pass you guys manage to get each one of you over trinket being the  hardest /none/ point  laura i tie him and then grog lifts him like a pulley  taliesin very uncomfortable for everyone involved  matt which when trinket reaches the top its like trying to fit an oblong  object through a hole  laura im flying so i get underneath him and try and wedge him help him get into the hole  matt well say it takes an additional ten minutes but you manage  to finally get trinket through  liam oh i have a rumbly in my tumbly  matt that was straightup winnie the pooh im really /none/ happy about that on the other side of the  now pretty much ruined acid distillery the residuum factory that was constructed here by the  briarwoods you can see in the tunnel before you that most of the stone before you has dissolved  and theres certain levels of eroded stonework that descends about 30 feet before rockily  climbing back up to the original height it was it can be traversed climbed with mild difficulty  but you gather yourselves to continue pushing forward and to both complete this journey and to  retrieve your ally who is /none/ now currently under the gaze of your enemy  and with that were going to take a quick bathroom break quick break  want to get back into this  travis well be right back ashley  matt see you guys in a second  break  matt and welcome back everyone so as you all take a moment to regather yourselves after this  circumstance you climb your way through this acidscarred portion of the hallway ahead of you  this like small tunnel up to the other side as youre on your way there percy you notice a /none/  flash of purple and black energy course up the front of your pepperbox you glance down at the  six oclock previously empty barrel and a new name now is emblazoned across it it says  cassandra de rolo  all oh  travis oh my god  marisha wait that was on that empty barrel  ashley what  laura oh my god i thought  marisha he didnt know who it was for  laura oh my god  sam wow  travis does any of us see this besides him  matt you guys all come /none/ up to the top you look down and you see percy still down looking at his  gun in a wideeyed spacey expression on his face  laura percival  travis you all right  taliesin no no im not  sam is your bangy thing okay is it your sister  taliesin well see what this means  marisha oh percy  taliesin lets go take care of this  travis yeah lets but you always have a choice  taliesin well see  matt you climb up and out you guys make your way down this tunnel no /none/ more than 60 feet from where  you are before the chamber opens up before you into what is a large underground cavern mostly  cleared out it looks like portions of it are you know both the tunnel and this area  laura can we stealth  matt you can if youd like  laura i think we should because as far as they know were dead now they dont know we got out  of there  marisha its true  matt okay so everyone go ahead and roll stealth  marisha oh my god  laura yeah /none/ im going to cast pass without a trace on us  marisha i still critical failed  laura wait cant you roll again now that i told you we were casting  matt laughs nah it stays unfortunately  laura doesnt work that way  matt all right so stealth rolls plus ten to everyones stealth what was it  travis 26  matt 26 vex  ashley 16  laura nice 35  sam 27  taliesin 24  matt okay as a median the group does really well so that helps overtake for your misstep  marisha god /dung/ its cold in here jesus  matt looking around you can see the boards and pieces of wood and stone that are keeping this  hallway up and as you step into this large chamber its dark and mostly freshly carved  earth elements of earth have been taken out and you can see to the right and left of you as you  enter this chamber there are more and more chunks of that broken stone and large piles of moved  earth that are in some levels of being left there or going to be moved out or /none/ eventually were put  to a point where it was no longer necessary to have to clear the area  you do see on the sides of you there are these iron carts wheeled carts that have handles on  them some have means of being pulled along separately these carts were used you can gather  for moving a lot of the materials back and forth its probably what the ramps in the previous rooms  were also to collect you can see theres a residuum dust coating on a lot of these carts as  well as broken /none/ pieces of whitestone  travis the broken pieces of whitestone are there any that are the size of two hands  matt theres a few you could probably grab yeah  travis can i grab a big twohanded piece and put it in the bag of holding  matt sure  laura can i take some of it and rub it on some of my arrows  matt okay sure you rub it on most of it falls off as its metallic arrow point to dust but  some of it does manage to stay on for the time being /none/ your holy oil is still active those that  you dipped your arrows in however as you look past the darkness you can see in the center of  this room a monolithic structure not unlike a large pyramidtype platformed element and  immediately upon looking at it you can see this has to be the ziggurat that everyones been  talking about in whitestone  you can see that the base of it is white and is very much the same texture and color as all of the  whitestone youve seen used in the construction and all of /none/ the mining materials here within the  city but from what little light you have in the room and there is a little bit of ambient light  from torches set at different points and those who can see decently at a distance and there is  an ominous glow to the structure itself it gradually turns to a greenish color hard to see  exactly why this transition is but it goes from white to a green towards the top and it levels  off you can see what looks to be a small separate structure at the very /dung/ top there are long  stairways that are visible on the two sides you can see before you long stairways  everyone make a perception check  laura im scared of all of my dice right now  marisha yeah mine are failing me  sam one  marisha fucking shit  laura 18  ashley 14  travis ten  taliesin 24  marisha 16  matt okay vex and percy as you begin to step out along the wall and as you guys are moving  towards the ziggurat you can see through the darkness there is a /none/ bit of low light along the  edge of the pyramid and you can see halfway up the staircase four individuals stepping up the  stairs at a distance  sam is this egyptian pyramidsized big  matt its more aztec its not quite gargantuan  sam theres 200 stairs  matt approximately id say the whole structure from bottom to high is maybe 200 feet tall its  not extremely large  taliesin whats the roof look like above it  matt its hard to see at this distance especially with the very little light here you  can /none/ tell just enough though that there is some sort of roof but you cant make any details out  from this distance  marisha do i have any geographical idea of where we are in the city is this located  under the sun tree  matt this would be pretty close to where the sun tree is located yeah  sam before we go stomping in there should we take a short rest and heal up is anyone besides  me and pike damaged at all  laura im damaged a little  marisha im damaged but  laura /none/ i dont know how long i want to wait when vax is  sam we dont want to start traipsing up theyll see us coming  travis is there cover can they see us if we can see them  matt where youre currently standing theres very little to no light if youre careful you  could possibly slip by their detection  sam or we could wait until they get up there and then go  taliesin except what happens when they get up there  liam quick question while im with my new friends in any moments that /none/ theyre not telling  me to go somewhere or walk somewhere can i just look at the symbol on my hand  matt yeah  liam thats it just stare at it whenever i can when theyre not paying attention  matt okay you glance at it it doesnt seem to have any particular glow or connection especially  since pike made her arrival it seems to be the energy of connection that was briefly housed in  that symbol by her has transitioned to her form here  travis will anybody gain something back from a short rest that /none/ we really need or do we need to  go after them  marisha im afraid theyre marching him to his death  laura to sacrifice him  travis what about you  sam id gain a few hit points but its nothing bad i can take a potion  marisha well have to heal in battle if we need to  ashley i can do a healing spell you know  sam thanks sarah palin  matt if youd like to  ashley wheres everybody at  laura that vasselheim accent is rubbing off on you pike  matt /none/ whos looking hurt  ashley are you guys all pretty low  taliesin im all right  sam not really  laura i think save your spells pike  marisha whats the plan  travis lets go  laura i dont know stealth as much as we can and then take them out i dont know  travis were at the bottom of this pyramid theyre walking up to the top  matt at this time theyre close to the top  taliesin lets start making our way  matt its just stairs pretty steep stairs but stairs nonetheless  /dung/ taliesin were going to have to ghostbusters this  laura how high up can i fly is it all dark up  matt it is theres a very little bit of light thats part of the ziggurat itself  laura i keep raising up  travis four sides to the pyramid  matt four sides you can only see two  laura i want to keep raising up so i can get a better view of whats happening  marisha i tell pike real quick pike we are right under the sun tree which was dedicated to  the god /none/ pelor this tree might end up being our best friend in this fight keep that in mind going  forward  laura are sarenrae and pelor good buddies  marisha yeah are they on good terms  ashley well lets hope so  laughter  laura would you know  matt you would know that sarenrae and pelor are adjacent deities in this realm they have many  overlapping interests and both strive to light to healing many spheres of overlap in those  regards so yes  ashley now that im thinking about it i think they are pretty /none/ good friends  sam how far away are the four figures from us right now  matt oh man theyre probably a good 500 to 600 feet from you  marisha should we flank and go  sam do you want to just hit them hard  laura or should we get on each side  marisha how many feet 50 to 60 feet  sam 600  matt theyre at the top of the ziggurat now actually at this time theyre just now cresting  over and vanishing over the lip  travis from the base of the pyramid /none/ what would you say the base circumference of this ziggurat  is is it half a mile around  matt no its smaller than that id say its about  laura 200 feet square one on each side  travis yeah should we come up on different sides  laura percy what do you think  marisha and taliesin flank them  sam theyre going to be inside though before we get halfway up  taliesin theres no inside its just on top  travis we dont know whats up there  laura can i see i raised up  /dung/ matt you raised up and you look  sam its for grain storage  laughter  matt what little source of light you can see where the stairs stop theres a level platform  theres some pillars and there appears to be a secondary structure a deep green almost dark  jadetype structure that is built a square structure right there at the very top  marisha probably out of the same glass bullshit  laura vax will hear me if i whisper down to everybody  travis oh fuck thats right  marisha see if he can stall tell /none/ him to stall  laura whispering vax vax  matt you can still respond if you wish you still have your mind about you you just consider  the briarwoods right now your closest allies and they have to be protected  liam where are you  sam no stop it  laura whispering i dont know where we are acid everywhere vax please isnt there anything  you can do  liam we should all be together you should join me here  laura whispering i would love to but i dont know where you are  liam im /none/ on the top of a thing i can see very far everybody is very attractive up here i think  something nice is about to happen im afraid to ask questions though i dont want to seem  matt who are you talking to lovely boy  laura whispering please vax please  liam to sarenrae  matt make a wisdom check  liam with no advantage im still a halfelf  matt i know  laura isnt he supposed to not be able to get charmed  liam 13 no i have advantage  taliesin feast  matt this /none/ isnt a saving throw  liam advantage for halfelf advantage for feast  matt what did you roll  liam total of 13  matt 13 okay you continue with the deception you pushed through enough to guard the answer as  opposed to spilling the truth to your ally she gives a thats not very welcome here i would  not recommend that put it away  liam what is that  matt put it away thats not welcome here  liam yes youre still very pretty  matt im taken my darling  laura im stalling so that /none/ everyone can walk around  liam me too  taliesin im starting to make my way up  marisha were flanking on the far side  ashley can i go up to vax and  laura oh hes not here  matt vax isnt with you guys vax is with the briarwoods at the top of the ziggurat  liam earring talk  ashley shit okay sorry that must have been when i got disconnected i know  whats going on now  matt so while theyre having this discussion you guys begin to ascend the steps as a group /none/  travis there are four sides who wants to come on my side  sam me and pike  travis okay  marisha ill go with grog  laura wait  taliesin and you can join me  laura im flying up  taliesin so im just walking up the center  laura trinkets going  taliesin with me  laura sure  taliesin trinkets with me  marisha guys thought for a second what if percy goes as a distraction percy goes first  sam we all look like percy  marisha but they might be able to see /none/ through that use percy as bait while  the rest of us go up  laura vax looks like percy right now they know were up to something  marisha thats why i said send in the real percy  laura send in the real percy  matt so how many groups are you breaking into  taliesin and travis three  matt three groups okay gnomes in one percy and trinket in one grog and who else  travis keyleth  matt keyleth and youre floating above somewhere  laura im floating above keeping an eye  matt okay /dung/  laura laughing oh no this is so stupid  marisha my heart is pounding  matt as you all separate the closest stairway to you you would probably get there sooner whos  taking that stairway  sam the gnomes were slow  laura and im sneaking into the dark as much as i can but i want to raise up and be where i can be  above them and shoot down  matt all right and you three are going on this side  travis sure  matt okay well say youre on this side  sam /none/ maybe we should split the party further  matt you could its not a bad idea  laura this is so brilliant  marisha weve got this  matt all right  laura oh god  matt as you begin to ascend the steps a couple of things one you notice the structure is very  old at its base the whitestone itself is cracked and worn weathered and most of it is indeed made  from the whitestone from the surrounding mountains of the alabaster sierras mined ages and ages ago  as you get further up you begin /none/ to see sections of it that are newer stone areas that have been  renovated and rebuilt and made to complete this apparently oncesundered structure  as you all begin to creep up past the midpoint you begin to notice the color change the  whitestone begins to fade away as you begin to see clusters of that same green residuum glass is now  set across smooth almost like the limestone of a pyramid like a top layer to it as you begin to  get further to the top eventually the entirety of the stone and the stairs /none/ are coated in this  material to the point where theres even a little bit of slickness in certain places from the  smoothness its like chipped obsidian how its flaked away and has those divots in it there is  that smoothness that glasslike texture to it  as you begin to get towards the very top of the stairway each of you carefully keeping in line  talking to each other quietly you begin to see the central structure at the top of the platform  begin to appear it is a simple fourwalled structure made purely of /dung/ this dark jade glass  material theres a slight overhang with a few platforms that seem to hold this for lack of a  better term awningtype platform that hangs over the entrance to this  you guys are about to reach the lip is there any preparation you want to do  travis quietly i would like to rage  laughter  marisha does the building seem is it completely encased  matt the building is entirely encased in this material  marisha and theyre already inside  matt you havent gotten to the very top of the lip /none/ yet  laura can i see im raised above right  matt you see as theyre having this conversation they talk a bit with vax speak with  cassandra then they step forward and begin to open the two doors to the central chamber  liam can i ask a clarification question the mojo they have on me do i think theyre my best  friends in the world or is it more kilgrave i do whatever they say but have my own opinion trapped  away  matt you have your own opinion you just trust them implicitly they /none/ have to be protected  liam all right its a little of both it seems like  matt like any close friend who would ask something of you and say please come with me  there is an essence that youre compelled  liam i trust them  matt you trust them yeah  ashley am i close to percy at all or did we already separate  matt no you guys have already separated  ashley dang it  marisha we have to stop them before they close these doors if they close the doors its over  sam /none/ do we see them closing the doors  matt theyve just opened the doors and are beginning to enter  marisha percy go get their attention percy  taliesin im heading up  laura im going to stay hidden as my oh god and im going to dip the rest of  my arrows in holy oil  matt okay as youre stepping up  sam i inspire pike real quick just before the battle  matt okay what do you do to inspire her  sam i just look at her and i say roses are red violets are /none/ blue were both gnomes and you are  so foxy  laughter  sam thats it  matt all right  marisha when i look up can i see the ceiling now  matt looking up you can see the roof is carved earth there is no loose stone it looks like this  chamber has been carefully hollowed out over time  marisha can i see a root system of a really deeprunning tree  matt currently no you cannot  marisha fuck okay  matt percy what are you doing  taliesin im walking up the steps im /none/ putting the mask on  matt as you put the mask on and you begin to ascend you can feel the nerves tickle your belly  and you know what youre about to encounter and doing so you feel that heat rise in the back of  your neck and as you do whoosh the smoke begins to billow out from under your collar and  out of your sleeves  taliesin i make my way to the top of the stairs  matt trinket coming slowly behind you they open the doors and theyre beginning to step into the /town/  chamber  taliesin sylas  matt they stop both lord and lady briarwood look over their shoulder  taliesin a moment of your time  matt they look at each other sighs close the chamber door sylas reaches out and grabs  something or pushes something thats out of sight and then they both turn and begin to step forward  a little bit with vax and cassandra flanking them stopping right outside of the doors  marisha okay as hes distracting them get in position try and stealth behind these  buildings  matt so you guys are /none/ on technically that side and that side of the pyramid right now  marisha yeah it looks like theres pillars and shit  matt yeah the pillars are evenly spread around the entire chamber  marisha yeah lets come in from the back i dont know what the gnomes are doing  matt you guys would have to have come around the corner and this is the walkway here so youd be  coming in from this side  sam stay out of sight but get as close as we can  laura i float closer in the darkness  /none/ matt okay over here  laura up up  matt up up my platforms seem to have gone missing for the preparation of this game but  well say for the time being you are up here  taliesin my hands are on a device which i have made thats on my hip that im ready to begin  using at a moments notice  sam its a french tickler  taliesin its the most ticklish french tickler youve ever seen baby  laura i dont have something planned im just going to go  sam whats this whats going /none/ on  taliesin we have debts to settle sylas  matt and apparently you and your friends are obnoxious enough to not stay dead  taliesin they were kind enough to make sure that i made my way here to face you  matt chuckles well perhaps this evening wont be so boring after all will it and sylas looks  over to delilah  delilah gives him a look too and says very well  taliesin the darkness demands your soul sylas im going to cast hex on lady briarwood and pull  my smoke bomb at the exact /none/ same second and throw it at them  matt okay so as you release your hand and the smoke builds up at your fingertips and then shoots  off and clings itself to her form she looks down with a bit of a grin halflaughs to herself as  the smoke bomb gets lobbed she begins moving her hands like that to begin casting a spell  laura i let go of my arrow and cast conjure barrage with a holy arrow at them  matt with a holy arrow at them all righty  marisha and im going to /none/ if i can peek around the corner start lighting up sunbeam theyre in  a nice pretty line and i like it its hot  laughter  matt it will take you a moment to get over to that point because you guys are just coming around  the corner so first things first percy you lob the smoke bomb thud hiss this area here fills  with a billowing smoke  taliesin i was shooting it right in front of them  matt yeah it fills this area here its a 20 by 20foot its essentially a recreation of /none/ the fog  spell for a short duration it fills that vicinity there as the smoke fills you want to conjure  barrage into the smoke  laura yeah i know theyre all there and it shoots a cone of arrows at them  matt yeah all right roll for that  laura its holy arrows all of them will be holy arrows because conjure barrage uses whatever kind  of ammunition i have shot  matt that it does  cheering  matt so whats the saving throw on that  laura oh thats a good question conjure barrage /none/ is dexterity save  matt were going to grave there we go proper briarwood music  liam surprise motherfucker  matt all right so  liam i dont know why my sister is firing at me but i would like to use uncanny dodge or evasion  whichever is applicable in this moment so i dont get hurt  laura theres a whole lot of arrows flying at you just letting you know  matt i believe uncanny dodge you just roll a saving throw and if you make it you take no damage  liam so dexterity right  /none/ matt i believe so yeah  liam thats pretty good thats a 28  matt okay damage on that was  laura 3d8 plus whatever the holy would be  matt the holy is an additional 1d4 radiant damage  laura okay for each  matt for anybody that would be affected by it  laura okay oh thats it i just do that 3d8 thats it  matt yep  laura nine  matt nine not including the d4 right  laura not including the d4  matt so thats four damage to both sylas and cassandra you take /none/ no damage from it because of  uncanny dodge  liam i call out and say vexahlia what are you doing  matt all right so roll a d4  laura two  matt two okay two additional points of damage to sylas all right and as the smoke begins to  dissipate  taliesin im going to start running im booking to the right and i dont have any more actions  do i  matt no thats going to be your go everyone now roll initiative for the beginning of the  briarwood battle  taliesin ugh oh /dung/ my god  marisha i have the shittiest fucking initiative rolls  taliesin thats stupid  marisha yeah so is mine  taliesin getting it all out of my system now  liam me too i call it dying  taliesin laughs thats how you get it all  out of your system  matt all right 25 to 20  sam nobody  matt all right  marisha nobody we all ate it  matt 20 to 15  sam 17  travis 15  sam i have the highest initiative  liam 16  matt 16  laura /none/ this is a problem  matt all righty  marisha fuck we dont get the drop on them because we were sneaking around  matt nope 15 to ten  laura 11  ashley 13  taliesin ten  matt all right  taliesin worst initiative ive ever rolled  laura 11  matt 11 and pike what did you get sorry taliesin  taliesin ten  matt all right so vex and taliesin  laura were going to die  taliesin laughing nervously were going to be fine  laura all my dice every dice i dont have any /none/ dice left to roll  matt at this point in time delilah steps this way outside of the smoke coughs moving out of  the way you can see there is a slight shimmer around her form at the moment  marisha a slight shimmer  matt yes she is going to begin by looking over to you who threw that bomb at her put out her  hand and say  taliesin can she see me  matt she stepped out of the smoke  taliesin okay because i moved bomb then ran  sam theres smoke between them /none/  taliesin theres smoke between us  matt in this area oh yeah so she would look around get out of the way look for you sees  nothing but a bear that has climbed to the top  taliesin i turned into a bear its willow  liam is it a bear or is it fat percy  taliesin its fat percy  matt technically it is she looks very confused for a second percy  liam wait question am i still percy  laura you still look like percy  liam if shes fooled by a fat percy /none/ shes surely fooled by a svelte percy does she think she has  percy whats going on  matt this seeming spell has fucked everything up  laughter  matt no they can still see the illusion but you get the sense that she can see through it meaning  its almost like the two layers are over top  liam so she can see big percy but realizes its not big percy  matt its not big percy  liam its just absurd  matt she can see a bear wearing a percy costume is how it looks to /none/ her  taliesin thats a bear wearing a percy costume  matt she actually looks around and sees the weird percy sees nobody else in the area she cant  see you because of your stealth even though the conjure barrage was in the middle of the fog  cloud it prevented her from keeping sight on anybody and youre out of the way so the only  thing she can see right now is weird trinket  laura i wanted to use my bonus action to hide  liam i see her confused look and i call out were /none/ all percy get it  laura 29  matt okay good to know she not really knowing what to do goes sylas take this boon she  puts her hand out and you can see a bit of dust form in there  marisha take this spoon  taliesin and travis boon  marisha and taliesin this spoon  matt she casts a spell on him that ends her turn and then she steps back into the side of the  fog there  travis she inspired him  matt you dont know  laura she helped him  matt /none/ scanlan youre up  sam all right i hear talking  matt you hear talking you come around the corner  sam i come around the corner  matt okay youre about here so you can move forward  sam the second i see her delilah i will cast lightning bolt on her  matt okay  laura lightning bolt shes immune  sam i dont know anything  matt all right you see her jump back into the cloud and you unleash  sam actually are they in a line is there a way i could get in a /none/ line  matt not with this pillar there no this pillars blocking the way right now youre only seeing  her at this point since she goes into this fog cloud so you can throw it in the direction she  is if you want to  sam i wouldnt know anything about her so yeah i blast  matt you release the bolt of lightning roll 8d6 damage  taliesin were you there for that fight  sam i dont know was i  laura yeah you were there for that fight  sam would i know anything  /none/ liam that was ages ago  laura it was a long time ago  matt you recall that lightning seemed to not have the impact it usually does  sam would i know that enough not to cast it  matt i would say through all the thoughts and preparation for this fight if you would like to  rescind that you would be ready to lightning bolt and be like wait no that didnt work  sam all right then undo i will undo and i will instead i will try to blind her  matt okay  taliesin /none/ thats a great idea spectacularly great idea  laura silence her would be good too  sam through my hand cone of clarity  matt all right whats the saving throw on that one  sam it would be 19  matt and what is the saving throw is it wisdom  sam oh im sorry blindness oh jesus i never use it so i dont know blindness is a  constitution saving throw  matt constitution for delilah yeah she makes it  sam she makes it  matt rolled 18 plus three 21  marisha bitch  sam /none/ so i wave at her  laughter  sam hi  matt she vanishes into the smoke cloud that percy had left  sam is that my movement  matt you can move a little closer if you want to  sam can i get the pillar between us  matt you can get there  sam and can i see anyone else  matt no  sam okay then thats it  matt okay that ends your turn scanlan vax youre up  liam what do i do in this situation i trust them but i also trust them /none/  matt you trust them both and right now theyve made an aggressive action against the briarwoods  the next one you see youre probably going to go ahead and try to make an aggressive action  liam im going to do whatever you tell me were i to see her the most important person to me in the  world act on lady briarwood id be like whats up thats lady briarwood kill her  matt you would try and attack her to try to convince her to stop the assault probably  liam okay and ive seen trinket /none/ and ive seen scanlan  matt youve seen percy  liam ive seen percy  matt scanlan you havent seen yet youre still inside this cloud all youve seen is percy you  didnt even see her strike at you other than seeing the arrows flying in so you know its her  liam then im going to step right in front of lady briarwood and shield her with my body from  percy  matt okay  liam percival youve got to stop this is madness this is that spirit of yours  matt grog  travis can they /none/ see me  matt youre just now coming around the side here so its hard to tell  you see a big cloud of smoke  travis im going to hold my turn  matt youre not going to get any closer  travis id like to put my back against the column  matt you use double movement to  laura fall over and then  matt to move right there behind the pillar with your back to it okay that gets us to sylas  marisha oh boy  matt leaping out of the smoke whoosh with an /none/ unnatural speed sylas jumping in the air  pulling from the scabbard on his back a long onyx twohanded sword youve seen once before leaps  and lands right before you percy  taliesin he can see me he can find me in the smoke  matt he leapt out of the smoke  taliesin okay  matt and has a really high passive perception he leaps and lands right before you with this grin on  his face the blade out in front of him and says boy you poke where you shouldnt and goes in  for three /none/ attacks on you with his blade thats a natural two so 12 oh no that would be 14 that  is a 34  taliesin 34 hits the other two do not  matt oh 24  taliesin 24 still hits  matt and then that would be his turn so

matt okay so that finishes that turn pike youre up  ashley okay im going to use healing word for percy  matt you have to get within range of him though youre on the /none/ opposite side of the

can hide behind it after you cast it  ashley can i try that  matt you can so you rush up around the pillar clicking your sprinters boots to give the  distance you rush up into the cloud right into the face of vax and vax you look down at pike  now aggressively coming towards you protecting lady briarwood you pull your daggers out  instinctively and look down at her with a look of what are you doing you reach forward and /none/ reach  out your hands against him let me check restoration real fast let me see here greater  restoration 5th level ends effects like charmed or petrified as you reach out and touch him you  feel the impact of the briarwoods influence fade from your mind as she touches you the charm is  dispelled and you look at your daggers and look where you are and look at the moments and the last  few minutes and youre like  liam then can i look up and stay in a defensive stance and back towards lady briarwood /none/  sam oh feigning  matt you know what make a deception check  travis laughing slick  liam 12  matt okay you back up into a defensive position towards lady briarwood okay thats just from  immediate reaction to that pike do you want to stay where you are do

of the bow you release and as it does it crack crack crackles with energy and  splits into three separate arrows that arc around each other almost like a helix of dna as they all  streak downward they impact noises slam into sylas from the other side him now being assaulted  on all fronts  laura i use my bonus action to hide again  matt okay well youre still out in plain sight unless youre pulling way way back if you want  to /none/ pull back towards the shadow  laura i want to hide  matt okay so you pull further and further away from it go ahead and make a stealth check  travis flying vex is pretty dope laughs  laura natural 20  cheering  matt vanish into the shadow of the sky you dart out of the darkness and then disappear back into  it all right that ends your turn percy youre up  taliesin i just got blasted whats that thing i can do im going to use a bonus action to do my  little healing /none/ surge that i can do  matt okay  taliesin my fighter ability thing which is 1d10

shove the diplomacy  glove right into sylass face and try and do a straight shove to get him off of me i have never  used this before i dont actually know how it works  matt right /none/ and you previously charged this  talisin i charged this when i got hit by the lightning attack in the crypt  marisha oh thats right  matt go ahead and make a melee attack so this would be id say  taliesin dex

it  taliesin thank you thats much better 22  /dung/ matt 22 will hit so as you reach out and grab him in the front the energy pulses in front as it  releases go ahead and roll 4d6 points of damage did not make his saving throw on that with a  four  marisha oh my god he rolled three sixes and a five  taliesin 23 points of damage  matt all righty the shock charges through his dark armor he groans you can see that the dark  veins pulse through his neck as the energy surges through his body he slaps the hand away at /none/ this  point and you can see the smoke and its hissing off the armor growls  sam hi  marisha what you going to do  taliesin im going to jesus christ okay i cant really use my gun because im too close im  going to pull out my sword and take two more slashes and im going to run like a mother  matt okay  taliesin first slash is a 28  matt hit  taliesin and thats lame thats 14 points of damage  matt okay  taliesin second slash is 23  matt 23 /none/ okay it hits  taliesin and

the strength thing  taliesin i know  marisha good thing /none/ you dont use strength  taliesin no  sam well it can still kill you  taliesin 15 16 17 22  matt okay you resist the effects of the blade now having saved from it that ends your turn at  the end of your turn sylas is going to go ahead and spend one of his legendary actions to get a  free movement without provoking attacks of opportunity and shift up with an amazing speed to  the other side of both as soon as you rush over to grog he appears up in front of you /none/ grinning  with his blade at the ready right next to you and grog that ends your turn  its now cassandras turn  marisha oh god damn it what are you going to do  taliesin make the right decision girl  matt roll a perception check percy  laura oh  taliesin blows raspberry nine  matt nine roll a perception check grog  marisha come on grog  travis 11  matt okay seemingly out of nowhere cassandra appears from behind the pillar blade out  shortsword at the ready and attempts to jam it into the /none/ back of grog  laura sneak attack damage shes a rogue  matt that is 21 to hit  travis that actually hits me  matt okay  marisha you can hear all the dice hes picking up  taliesin oh goddamn it  matt 27 points of piercing damage  travis halved because im raging  matt slashing damage because its a sword but yeah halved  travis 13  matt 13 points of slashing damage from the sneak attack  taliesin that could have been worse  matt that will end cassandras turn next up is keyleth  /none/ marisha oh finally okay running up the stairs running up the stairs  matt well youve been waiting around the side here for everyone so youre just now cresting  around that corner  marisha beautiful can i move to where im in a nice pretty line with a briarwood and cassandra  over here and sunbeam  matt okay  ashley yes  taliesin sings deo gratias  marisha right in a line  sam do it this is it this is everything right here  liam come on kiki  taliesin youre our cannon  marisha ive been /none/ waiting  matt sunbeam yeah it will hit both him and cassandra and grog  sam and grog  travis who cares  matt all right so a constitution saving throw grog  travis constitution  matt cassandra makes it with a 21  travis 16  matt 16 whats your dc  marisha 17  matt so full damage on grog half damage on cassandra i mean no damage shes going to use  her reaction to use uncanny dodge so cassandra takes no damage from it sylas is going to use one  of his legendary resistances to /none/ automatically succeed on his saving throw so he takes half  damage oh they had disadvantage on the saving throw but he can automatically make it  so never mind  marisha 15 plus eight so thats 23 23  matt 23 damage  marisha yes  matt okay halved he takes 12 points of radiant damage so as you rush around the corner he sees  you appear again and gives you a look as the beam of light appears his eyes roll back in fear and  the blast fire noise streaks out blasting into grog blasting into /none/ him  marisha undead and oozes have disadvantage on saving throws  matt correct but he has the ability to automatically make the saving throw as a  legendary creature however as the beam fades you can see part of his face is burned to ash and  you can see where the lip is gone the teeth are exposed and the sharp fangs  marisha and i dont know if this makes any amount of difference but for the duration of the spell  i have a 30foot radius sunlight glowing in my hand  matt correct  marisha /none/ so its bright in here now  laura i like it now i can see oh shit  travis as long as hes in that circle  matt all right  taliesin yeah just keep on him  marisha yeah its a 30foot radius  matt okay so that ends keyleths turn back to the top delilah delilah is now going to step out  of the cloud which is now dissipating at this point  liam is she taking a step away from me  matt yes  liam im taking my blade with the poison on it and /none/ im going to slash at her  matt okay as your reaction  liam that is an 18  matt 18 would hit her  liam okay that had whatever that poison is that i sold my soul to a hag for  matt yes it did so roll damage on that  liam okay so the regular damage is  laura dont say you sold your soul to a hag  liam lets deal with one problem at a time thats a ten for just the damage  matt okay roll an additional 6d6 poison damage  sam 6d6 /none/  laura thats a sneak attack  liam no this is poison im not in a position to sneak attack  laura but this is the same as a sneak attack  liam 12 13 19 24 points of poison  matt all right so as you strike out the blade scrapes across the front of her shit i forgot  that ill keep that in mind for next time the blade streaks across the front of her body as she  runs past pained gasp then you feel as she takes a few steps away groans and she coughs /none/  and blood spatters across the ground she looks over her shoulder at you heavy breathing  liam i just stare with a halfcocked smile  matt she immediately looks back at you and says you boy stay still and puts her hand out  towards you i need you to  liam advantage because im a half elf i dont need anything because im a halfelf  laura is she blinded  sam it didnt work  liam is she trying to charm me or hold me  matt nope  liam trying to disintegrate me to death  /none/ matt she looks over to you and mutters under her breath foreign word its a phrase youve never  heard before but as soon as it happens  sam as soon as she does that do i see this  matt youre just around the side of this  sam i do not see it  matt you glance around the side for threequarters cover roll a perception check  sam its a dead roll a dead roll its between two thats terrible four  matt yeah you do not see this happening unfortunately your mind suddenly goes blank as /none/  the power word thats spoken suddenly stuns you in place unable to react  liam is it a wisdom thing  matt theres no saving throw if you have less than 150 hit points you are stunned for the next  minute you have to make a saving throw every turn to resist it  sam okay shes strong  matt so you stop there your daggers clanking noise drop to the ground as the smoke begins to  dissipate around you  liam do the daggers then shunt back up to my belt though  matt just the /none/ cycle  laughter  matt no its more of a willful return once you regain your composure you can will them back to  you but currently youre drooling out of your mouth staring into space right there she moves  off to this side and gets behind cassandra for protection shes going to end her turn she did  waste her action that turn to do that scanlan youre up  sam yeah man shes powerful i will step out again from behind and i will try again but this  time i will say hey you paralyzed my /none/ friend lets see if you like it and ill try to hold  her hold person  matt to hold person okay a dc of 19 you said for that  sam yes  matt all right shes going to make a wisdom saving throw she rolls a 21 a natural 19 with a  plus two i know but as the spell shoots out from your hands it bounces off of her seemingly to no  effect she is inherently a very powerful caster and her defenses show that do you want to use  your movement to move /none/ closer or do you want to stay where you are  sam thats vax near me right there  matt vax is right there yeah  sam im going to shit hide behind you  liam sure im bigger than you  sam i will use my bonus action to inspire percy and ill say sings percys got a gun  percys got a gun and then yeah sure ill try to duck behind vax for cover  liam the whole worlds come undone  matt okay thatll get you to about there okay thatll end your turn vax youre /none/ up you spend  your turn staring off into space at the end of your turn make a constitution saving throw  liam okay right now 14  matt 14 yeah unfortunately youre still caught there staring off into the darkness looking out  over the rest of this cavern before you  liam its a constitution  matt its a constitution yeah  liam okay  matt all right grog youre up  travis id like to go into a frenzied rage and i would like to see and swing away at lord  briarwood  taliesin yeah  /none/ matt all righty actually real fast before that happens at the end of vaxs turn sylas is going  to use one of his secondary legendary actions to move without his movement again back over to this  side of the pillar he darts around  travis well he left cassandras there  matt you can still move during your turn if you want to but if you want to go after  cassandra you can  travis she would get an attack of opportunity wouldnt she im going to turn her into  applesauce  matt okay  laughter /none/  travis sorry not really sorry 21  matt that hits  travis same thing 21  matt that hits  travis and a 14  matt 14 misses  travis 17 24  matt 24 damage on the first one  travis 24 for the first one and 22 for the second one  matt okay  travis but she doesnt take any holy damage off of the oil on the thing right  matt no but as the hammer slams into her armor she gets slammed against the pillar from the  impact of it she tries to /none/ right herself and push off against the wall you use the momentum to spin  around and hit her in the other side slamming her up against the wall on the side of the structure  and you hear her breath escape and she goes gasping breath is having to catch her breath  and she looks at you with this look of that really hurt  travis yeah ive been known to take a ladys breath away laughs  matt you want to move or will you stay where you are  travis ill stay where i am  /none/ matt okay that ends your turn it is now sylass turn sylas looking over this way he does not  regenerate any hit points because of the multitude of holy and radiant damage he took last  turn his regeneration is stunted at the moment he has to keep away from keyleth he is going to  instead hes in a rough place then hes going to move one two three four five six nope  actually hes going to you know what hes going to take it hes going to go ahead and  boldly step into the sunlight /none/ which puts him at disadvantage with his attacks but he is going to  unload on you percy who he marked previously  travis he marked you  matt you marked his wife so that is a 20  taliesin yeah that hits  matt second strike is two natural 20s in a row with disadvantage he still crits  travis two natural 20s in a row  matt yeah so with disadvantage he still crit  liam fucking bastard  matt the last one is a 23  marisha with disadvantage he still crit how  matt i rolled /none/ two natural 20s in a row  marisha oh you yeah right  taliesin im so excited about this new character im working on  matt 14 points of slashing damage from the first strike  taliesin jesus okay 14  matt the crit is 27 points of slashing damage  taliesin oh boy  matt and the last one is 13 points of slashing damage roll three constitution saves  taliesin ill tally up the damage in a minute  matt actually ignore the last attack because technically lady briarwood would have lost her  concentration on the haste /none/ spell she had on him from the damage she took earlier  taliesin ignore the last attack  matt ignore the last attack  taliesin so that would have been my first save is 13  matt 13 all right that does succeed  taliesin and thats 22 yeah  matt so you resist the effect of the two strikes  taliesin im going to figure out how much damage i just took  marisha 41  taliesin no its 27 37 oh 41 youre right im alive  matt okay so that ends taliesins turn pike youre up  /none/ all pike  ashley what are you at

pretty close to dying  ashley okay im going to sprinters boot over to him  matt how many times can you use sprinters boots  ashley say again  matt sprinters boots how many times can you use it does it

healing word all righty thats a bonus action you can still do up to a 2ndlevel  spell as your action if youd like  sam do it  ashley /none/ shoot okay im not close to him  liam can you unleash some holy fire on any fucks  laura yeah like a radiant blast or something  ashley can i take my mace of disruption and slam it on the ground  matt if you want to  ashley oh god wait how close am i to sylas

that freaking wizard woman man  laura im going to attack lady briarwood with just two attacks  liam thats good chip her down  matt and you keep trinket here by the steps  laura trinkets going to run next to vax  matt okay all right yeah youre within range youre fine  laura okay and then im going to shoot her a couple times  matt all right go for it  /none/ laura okay 23 for the first  matt okay because i forgot to do this on the last attack were initiating now her image is  shifting based on her location so you have a disadvantage on the attack roll  laura natural 20  liam but the last one was good so 23  laura yeah the first one was a 23  matt 23 hits  laura natural 20 again  matt okay you do not have disadvantage after you hit her the effect vanishes that is a  natural 20 against her go ahead and roll damage /none/  laura 17 for the first one and then what do i do just double the second  matt roll damage then double the dice roll  laura 19 for the second  matt okay cool so arrow whizzing the arrows both strike into her chest pained grunt the  shimmering to her form vanishes for a second you can see her cloak falls limp momentarily she  looks off into the shadow and sees you floating above  laura hide  matt you attempt to hide right now youre just pulling in and out of the shadow you shoot /none/ and  youre going to have to try and back up even further probably out of your attack range to  disappear again  laura instead of backing up can i go sideways  matt you can try to get over this way but you dont have enough movement to get there youd get  about there and still be out in the open this turn  laura okay  matt its one of those things where youre just out in the sky right now initially when there  was the overhang and they were covered in the smoke it /none/ was easier for you to hide in the  shadow but now youve made yourself known you have nothing hiding behind you and her  laura can i go below where the steps are to hide behind the wall  matt you would be able to get right about level this turn and next turn you could go beneath so  you would not be able to hide as an additional this turn  laura okay then i want to stay high and im going to use my bonus action to cast hunters mark  on her  matt okay /none/  laura oh man i should have done that at the beginning but i thought i was going to hide  again what a waste  matt all righty so that ends your turn percy youre up actually at the end of your turn  sylas is going to use another one of his legendary actions to make another attack on percy  taliesin godfuckingdamn it  marisha how many of those fuckers does he have  matt oh he gets three every turn  marisha he gets three every turn  travis every round  matt after every round /none/ i mean that will be he has disadvantage so he doesnt crit laughs but  that is still a 30  sam and taliesin 30  matt he rolled a 19 and a 20 my rolls for him have been pretty good these past few rounds so  thats another 13 points of slashing damage against you  taliesin all right  matt and make a constitution saving throw  taliesin and make another constitution saving throw  marisha how are you  sam pike helped  taliesin 13 points of damage  matt yep and then roll another constitution /none/  taliesin saving throw thats 18  matt 18 youre fine okay continue with your turn  taliesin still he keeps getting in my shit theres just no getting the fuck away from him is  there thats fine well hes in the 30foot radius of light right now so do my attacks have  an advantage against him  matt no he just has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks  taliesin okay theres just no backing away from him right now im going to have to wait for him  to try and break off from me /none/ through grog  marisha he wants you he wants your bod  taliesin yeah i get it so everyone wants my bod im going to take three slashes with the  sword again since im too close to use the guns  matt okay  taliesin 25  matt 25 hits  taliesin 14  matt 14 misses  sam you got inspiration  taliesin i know but i dont want to waste it on this and 13  matt only one strike hits twice you pierce hes just too fast on one side strikes off his armor  harmlessly /none/ one strike does manage to get over the collarbone of his armor and pierce into his chest  he goes groan from the pain go ahead and roll damage  marisha hes got more where that came from though hes a very inspiring person  taliesin i want you to inspire other people 12  matt 12 damage all right that ends your go  taliesin save it for a shot  matt cassandra is going to actually shes going to move alongside still staying next to  grog and moves up with her blade out towards you  taliesin /none/ goddamn it  matt looks over at sylas and sylas is nudging with his eyes and she looks at you and she drops  her blade for a second and just stands there for a second looking at the scenario and her turn is  spent there  taliesin yeah  laura shes trying shes trying to fight it  matt keyleth youre up  marisha knock her out me  matt yeah  marisha okay how close am i to sylas  matt you are currently 25 feet from him  marisha okay heres what im going to do /none/ seeing that sylas is distracted im

balls fuck shit ten  matt hes going to use his second legendary action to automatically succeed the saving throw  marisha 25 total  matt 25 okay so thats 13 this time as you blast into his back you see the light burns  through parts of his shoulder and chunks of his flesh are actually blown through his armor his  armor streaks open for /none/ a second hes like pained grunt smoke is now sizzling up around  him and he looks over his shoulder with this angry red gaze  marisha and i take my nails and dig them in a little bit  matt at the end of your turn he uses another legendary action to then try and shove you off and  arc upwards with his sword across the front of your chest even with disadvantage thats still  19  marisha hits  matt all right you take 16 points of slashing damage then make a constitution saving throw  /none/ marisha oh wait hang on okay has to be over 12 right a saving throw 17  matt 17 okay you resist the effect of the sword that ends your turn back at the top sylas  right now is like panting hes looking pretty rough lady delilah runs up around the side and  goes my love were not ready but the timetables been pushed we have no choice and  she wraps her arms around them and they both  sam i cast counterspell as a reaction  matt whats the range on counterspell  liam not again /none/  sam 60 feet am i close enough  travis i dont think you are  matt 60 feet

her  laura quietly can you inspire vax  sam this is the rest of my turn i already used it to inspire grog  matt all right so thats the end of grogs turn all right it is now sylass turn sylas is going /none/  to step off to the side here stepping off to the stairs to get out of the range of the sunlight  just outside of the radius of it and glancing over at you after you just unleashed that swing  of attacks towards his wife he goes you help us make a wisdom saving throw with advantage  travis with advantage  matt with advantage  liam roll high  marisha roll like youre percy  matt what did you roll  travis a four  matt with advantage  travis yeah  matt wow with that grog /none/ now you realize youve been on the wrong side of this battlefield the  whole time and your allies are being assaulted by individuals that claim to be your friends but  might be completely against this whole circumstance your allegiance switches for now to  defend them at all costs thats going to end his turn pike  travis wait im raging can i be charmed  cheering  matt thats a good notification to make the charm effect hits your mind this is why you read  your abilities guys i dont remember all the details  sam /none/ best question of the night  liam oh my god  travis intelligence of six it takes a second  matt as you see this look you feel the influence begin to pry but it isnt enough to push through  the red and blazing anger  taliesin yeah  liam that was the thin red line travis  matt with that you see the expression of intent and some worry on sylass face ending his turn  pike what are you doing  ashley my turn okay so i would like to channel divinity and destroy undead  marisha /none/ yes  sam this is what we hired you for  matt just as a heads up destroy undead for the most part is only effective against lowerlevel  undead knowing that sylas is a vampire it might not have the desired effect that youre thinking  it might  ashley okay  matt just as a heads up you can still turn undead and it may make him afraid of you  but that is  ashley lets give it a try  travis i like it  matt all right were bringing this up here real fast  /none/ ashley how close am i to him  laura pretty close  liam pretty close 20 feet  ashley you know what i feel like i want to hit him with my mace of disruption  matt if you want to  liam hes rough  matt so instead you run up charging towards him shield up in front of you pike her blazing  radiant form the energy rippling off from behind her you pull back your mace and as it swings  through the air a quick flicker of angelic wings appear at your back as your mace /none/ swings down  towards him go ahead and roll your attack  ashley come on okay 16 but im going to use war gods blessing and add ten  matt yes you can do that  travis war gods blessing  matt okay war gods blessing  travis she has inspiration from you too right  sam but has she rolled yet  matt yep when any creature within 30 feet makes an attack roll you can use your reaction to grant  that creature usually its against other creatures okay war gods blessing you can only  use on /none/ other creatures but you do have channel divinity guided strike which you can use on  yourself its essentially the same thing you give yourself plus ten bonus to the roll  ashley okay  matt so you use your channel divinity guided strike instead  ashley got it  matt okay so that would bring you to 26 that would hit  ashley okay  matt okay all right so you slam down onto sylas with your mace of disruption go ahead and roll  damage on that he is considered an undead  laura kill him  liam /none/ a thousand pieces  ashley how many times do i roll  matt well you roll your damage and it does an additional 2d6 radiant damage  taliesin damn  liam the mace damage  ashley okay got

get their heads down like ashley  ashley okay 21  matt 21 points of damage  ashley yeah  matt okay as /none/ per the effect of the spell he now has to make a wisdom saving throw which he does  succeed if he failed he would have been destroyed however on a success he is still  afraid of you so he is now considered afraid of pike disadvantage on all attack rolls  travis fuck yeah he is let them know pike  matt until the end of your next turn awesome pike anything else you want to do on your turn  or is that it  ashley i would love to go up to vax but i dont /none/ think i can right  matt no

right /none/ as the arrows thud thud one hits the armor and streaks off and  shatters against the green glass stonework of the top of the ziggurat the second one strikes him in  the back of the neck you see a blast of radiant energy crosses his throat he reaches up and tries  to grab for the arrow but the arrow itself is disintegrated by the blast of holy energy leaving  a gaping wound in the back of his neck hes still standing but you can see his form is now falling  apart parts of ash are /none/ beginning to pour off his flesh hes looking really rough  all right that finishes vexs turn unless you want to move stay where you are  laura im afraid my flying potions going to start to wear off soon so im going to move is  there a roof on that middle compound building  matt from what you can see no it is open  laura oh really  matt yeah  laura can i land on top of the pillar  matt the pillar holds a slight overhang so you can land on top of the overhang /none/ if you want  laura yeah  matt all right so you land on top of the overhang stopping there which blocks all view  from beneath this line there but  laura but i can still see  matt you could peek around if you want  laura yeah okay  matt okay percy youre up  taliesin okay first thing im going to do is im going to pull out the pepperbox and im going to  take a shot at sylas and im going to get him to drop his sword  matt

weapon  taliesin but he drops his weapon  matt so with that bullet impact the blade he was holding clatters to the ground before him the  onyx blade shining in what low light there is around this temple  taliesin now im going to take a shot at him thats a 29  matt hits  /none/ taliesin that does ten points of damage  matt ten points of damage as that bullet hits him soft impact you see he begins to dissipate  and then turns into a mist form in the space where he is he is currently now a form of mist  laura so he can go heal himself unless we can get him  taliesin shes going to take care of this how close am i to lady briarwood  matt youre ten feet from her  taliesin ten feet thats close enough i guess im going to take a couple of /none/ steps back and im  going to do a fire shot and an ice shot with my last two shots  matt well youve already done two shots  taliesin oh yeah ill fire shot with my next shot does she currently have advantage or no  matt no because it has not come back to her  taliesin okay so im going to also put sharpshooter on that  matt okay  taliesin yay counting 26 to hit  matt that hits  taliesin so thats plus  sam is that her right there no thats cassandra  matt /none/ thats cassandra thats briarwood right there  taliesin oh and plus the hex so thats counting 24 points of damage plus two points of  fire damage  matt whew nice the shot bang blasts into the side of her face you can see part of her jawbone  is cracked as part of this and her ear is blown off to one side of her face choked groan and  she cradles it to her side as grunts  laura like a ketchup packet  taliesin lets spend an action surge and keep enjoying this  liam our cleric /none/ giggles from vasselheim  taliesin why dont we take a  liam if theres a time to blow your wad its now  taliesin yeah lets take a violent shot on top of that  laura violent shot  taliesin i use the violent shot action with the ice damage lets see what that does natural 20  this is going to be ugly as fuck  travis laughing of course it is  marisha of course  matt and this is all piercing damage right  taliesin oh my god this is so fucking bad is what this is /none/ about to be oh my god this is going  to be so let me get these additional dice okay so lets start doing this do all of the dice  rolls get doubled  matt all of the dice for this roll  taliesin all of the dice for this roll oh boy  matt roll the dice and then double it  taliesin okay  marisha high rolls big money no whammies it could be worse  taliesin counts quietly 42 points of damage plus eight points of ice damage  matt okay this blast hits her in /none/ the side of the shoulder and the cloak catches fire for a moment  before dispersing and you can see the impact theres blood now seeping into her robe shes  looking rough but youve noticed with each of these shots the impact youre used to doing with  these shots is not doing the full impact you would expect especially with the force of these blows  every shot youve taken on her in particular that ends your turn  taliesin no ive still got two more shots actually i get my grit point back from that  because /none/ that was a natural 20 so that was a free shot  matt when do you reload by the way  taliesin i have two more shots and then i have to reload im keeping track im being good  lets hit her in the legs  matt okay  taliesin thats 20 to hit  matt 20 to hit this is with your minus five are you taking a sharpshooter shot on this  taliesin yeah 20 to hit  matt you rolled a what  taliesin no 20 total to hit  matt right okay  taliesin i /none/ rolled a 13  matt yeah okay so that does hit yes  taliesin because she has her disadvantage she needs to make a constitution saving throw  matt 22  taliesin dc equals eight plus my proficiency mod plus my dexterity mod  matt plus ten so 18  taliesin she made it she didnt fall but she still takes some damage so lets see what she  does ten 12 22 28 points of damage  matt all righty  taliesin and because this is really annoying me im going to give her a gut shot torso shot /none/ same  thing sharpshooter  liam im seeing this all in slow motion  marisha throwing bullets  taliesin 27 points of damage and she has a disadvantage on strength and dexterity checks for  the rest of the round for one full round  matt good to know  taliesin im going to back up a little bit for the rest of my  matt over here  taliesin yeah that way  laura get out of her view  matt sure that ends your turn percy  taliesin laughs yeah  matt cassandra seeing all this go down /none/ and having this crisis moment picks up her sword  rushes over and uses her action to pull out one of the potions that you gave her the greater  healing potion and feed it to the ailing briarwood  taliesin damn it girl  sam i gave her one i gave her a greater  laura a greater we wasted a greater  sam im a nice guy i cant resist the charm of a woman especially one who looks identical to you  matt her wounds close up a little bit the ear wound heals over a little /none/ bit and she wipes her  mouth thank you dear sylas to the ritual  laura hes a mist  matt keyleth its your turn  taliesin do it do it girl  liam burn him  marisha okay so i turn and i start shouting to the mist and i say whats the matter sylas  afraid of a little gnome and a druid and i blast him with sunbeam  travis good line  laura laughing that was the lamest thing  marisha thanks im not good with lines keyleth isnt good with lines are you afraid of /none/  us i heard percy try to do lines and im like thats what badasses do  matt i guess in this particular instance i want to ask you  how do you want to do this  cheering  liam sorry cursed gun  matt theres still a semivisible form of his body but in a mist form its trying to slowly  escape off the top of this structure  marisha okay pike is standing right next to him  matt correct  marisha im going to use pike and use the light that i have off pike /none/ and combine it to do a joint  sunbeam holy bomb  matt okay  marisha boom  matt great  liam hes going to eat a bag of holy dicks is what youre saying right  marisha yeah i want him to eat a bag of holy dicks now explain that please  make it sound great  matt so looking over at pike already ready with her mace up in the air and the mist recoiling from  her you glance at each other have that connective point and as pike brings up her  shield you bring /none/ back your sunbeam and throw it towards the shield arcing it in his direction as  she ricochets the reflection of the actual sunlight back at him at the same time  laura that was way cooler than what you said  marisha yeah way cooler i knew hed bring it through  matt as it sprays across the beams themselves seem to form nearly phallic rays  laughter  matt tearing through the mist and with an echoing scream you hear sylass voice ring out  screams as the mist is immediately dissipated and disintegrated and his form is /none/ no more  cheering  marisha high five pike  laura how does it feel lady briarwood  matt she looking over her shoulder still looking at him as shes called to him to go join  in the altar room the ritual room looks over and sees his mist form in slow motion from her  perspective she sees keyleth step forward wind blowing around her releasing this beam and  watching him be disintegrated immediately her eyes open wide and she screams out no sylas  and you can see her whole body shaking now the horror of /none/ seeing her partner the love of her  life disintegrated before her tears immediately burst down her face and her hands are shaking  there as she screams out you cant i broke the world for us no  thats the end of your turn  liam may i ask a question  matt yes  liam does cassandras charm come from sylas or lady briarwood  matt at this point you have no idea  laura what about yours  liam from lady briarwood yeah  sam the lady  laura the lady  matt yours is fine all /none/ right does that end your turn keyleth  marisha yeah  matt all righty so with that it brings us to the top of the initiative round it is now lady  delilah briarwoods turn looking around heaving with anger and frustration she looks around her  area and the tears streak down her face blood streaking down one side of her head she looks at  cassandra who right now is faltering seeing everything closing around her she goes its too  soon but its our only chance and with that she is going to step around here  /none/ liam somebody hit her hit her  matt shes still in combat with you so you dont get an attack of opportunity keyleth you do if  you want to try and swing towards her  marisha can i use my sunlight that i have up  matt no you have to make a combat strike  marisha my staff  laura trip her  marisha can i go for a trip  matt no this

back of the head as she stumbles forward and looks about the rest  of you she is using her last 5thlevel spell to attempt to cast another dimension door out of the  sight of the one who previously dispelled it  sam can i counterspell that  matt you have no visual on her she is behind the pillar this time she knew where you were and was  not about to let that happen again she disappears /none/ behind the pillar and you guys watch her step  into the doorway and vanish from sight  laura seriously  matt shes still hunters marked  laura shes hunters marked  matt you still have hex on her for as long as that lasts  taliesin that lasts a while  laura is he under the thing still or did it break  matt the flight lasts for an hour the potion lasts for an hour and its probably been about  liam no shes asking if im still  matt you currently yes make another constitution saving throw /none/  liam come on big roll 13 plus nothing is 13  matt all right so as you guys all look around yourselves sylas disintegrated cassandra still  holding the blades and looking around and is going from a fight position almost like a cornered  creature to looking at the sundering of her brother and is looking completely frazzled and  confused shes on the verge of tears or a rage of her own  you look over and see your brother down below and is just standing there his daggers dropped to the  ground in front of /none/ him and has been staring into space this entire time  laura i float down in front of him and slap him across the face  matt like that okay make another saving throw  liam nope  matt okay you

been here a very long time lets just knock her unconscious and let her be  liam i turn towards her and i punch her across the jaw as hard as i can  matt at this point with the damage shes taken /none/ and the mental shock shes in and the current  circumstance the one hit whack clocks her and she goes unconscious in his grip limp  laura you can handcuff her behind her back  travis we do have manacles  laura yeah  sam put her in the bag of holding  others no  taliesin thank you  laura maybe greater restoration her  ashley yeah can i greater restoration on her  matt do you have another

a length of rope and wrap it around her ankles and tie it back  to her hands so she cant stand up  laura oh sorry cassandra thats going to suck  travis shes got /none/ to stay there when she wakes up  matt all right bigbys hand does last a minute if you want to keep it maintained the minute has  passed at this time its probably going to pass  sam all right before it passes it gives me a quick deeptissue massage  matt okay  travis can i pick up sylass onyx sword  matt you can yeah  taliesin what does a common healing potion do by the way  matt itll require a short rest to attune and get the nature of it but it is a very /none/ beautiful new  weapon  travis okay ill put it in the bag of holding  taliesin you picked up his sword good thats why i had him drop it  travis yeah i noticed

see from being on the roof whats inside the building you said theres no roof to  that temple i was up on top of  matt correct if youre /none/ looking inside of it right now you glance over its an openroofed  square construct there are two hallways that lead to the inside on both sides the walls have a  strange icy texture to them its hard to make out the details from what little light is in there  there is a central platform that rises up in the middle there is a stairway on the opposite side  of the room that leads up to that platform and there are a series of grooves in the ground that  form some sort of shape that you /none/ cant make out from this viewpoint you do see lady briarwood  atop that platform right now  sam how far  laura shes inside the temple  taliesin lets go in i

from some sort of scroll  liam how far away is she  matt shes about 80 feet from you  taliesin i pull out bad news  matt none of you guys can see her only she sees /none/ her you guys are still on the

ledge or a wall  matt theres a ledge that goes around the entire wall that encases this but theres no roof its  just an open square area so you would get up to there  marisha can i go up next  /none/ laura can i maybe go through the piece of paper that shes reading  matt that wouldve been something to call before you shot her next attack you can if you want  liam so you said jennifer lopez is 80

one because it is the explosive arrow  laura oh shit no 15  matt 15 the arrow whizzes past and slams into the bottom of the pillar you see a muffled  explosion and light flash and it rocks the center a bit but she still maintains concentration she  looks over at where it came from  laura should i have shot her /none/ im sorry i should have shot her  sam its fine it wouldnt have done anything  marisha can i try something am i able to try something is she still bleeding  all over this orb  matt the bleeding has finished the orb is rising up and pulsing  liam question  matt yes  liam did we

marisha so wiping the blood off probably wouldnt work  matt you can try  travis lets say no  liam if she rolls really high really high  taliesin how good do you feel about a natural 20  marisha how

marisha 15  matt okay focusing from this distance /none/ you try to the blood shifts across the surface but there  is some sort of power thats holding it to the orb it is unmoved i know scanlan  sam

of the platform from the blast of it you can see blood  streaking down her other arm /none/ now and she has blood down the side of her face down one arm and  the other and shes shaking in place on the platform she sees you lifting towards holding  the robe to the side and shes looking at the orb and doesnt even seem to really know whats  going to happen theres this anticipation and fear in her eyes everythings been torn from her  at this point shes a caged animal with nothing to lose  that finishes your turn taking her turn she sees you rushing towards her she extends her finger  /none/ laura oh

your existence still holds you aloft drifting forward  almost toppling over in your fly spell  at this point she looks at her finger frustrated glances /dung/ at the rest of you and looks  forward at the orb and goes come on come on at this point the orb is now shimmering and the  blood is slowly spilling over the outside of the dark onyx sphere it begins to spin  and spin and spin  laura am i close to it  matt youve moved up to this point now youre right at the edge the orb suddenly shrinks in a  flash of an instant becoming this tiny speck this little dark speck in the air roughly the  size of a dime /dung/ and thats it she waits no no no no it cant be too soon please please and  she falls to her knees shes staring at this dark speck in the air the writhing walls of the room  fall
