none	 love it all right so to get you guys get caught up to speed  with what we did in recent episodes  muffled dramatic music  sam is that you liam  matt anyway last we left off vox machina had confronted the whispered one the undying king  vecna in the shadowfell the battle did not go in your favor with the death and very faint recovery  of vex and the disintegration of vax during this confrontation realizing that it was not going in  your favor you plane shifted to the feywild where you began to 
none	 come up with some sort of plot  or plan to try and bring your friend vax back without a body during this time vax had a  conversation with his patron the raven queen and was given an offer where he could return along  with powers that would aid in this coming final confrontation however the deal came with some  drawbacks and upon his friends awakening the next morning in the feywild they found vax returned to  them whole seemingly alive returned though missing his equipment equipment returned and a  brief period of figuring out 
none	 what possibly delivered their friend back to this space it was  decided that based on his experience with his patron that the powers beyond the divine  gate the prime gods that lay claim to the divine beyond the prime material plane will probably be  the next best bet in gaining some sort of power information about how to better prepare for the  coming struggle with vecna the whispered one  you then made your way to vasselheim where pike went to her temple of sarenrae which she had  helped raise and reconstruct and had a 
none	 vision from her patron deity asking her to come visit her  at the island of renewal and was granted through this vision an object that would link via your spell  a way to traverse past the divine gate and directly to her location on the plane of elysium  also grog and scanlan had a little excursion in the city of vasselheim and a minor altercation  with the guards which led to a larger altercation with the guards which led to a much larger  altercation with the guards which led to them barely escaping and deciding 
none	 its time to go  travis we cant go back  marisha vasselheims most wanted  matt yeah you guys then clasped hands and using the plane shift spell found yourselves stepping  down on the crunching sandlike shores of the island of renewal there looking past the clusters  of stone and trees that mark the perimeter of this interesting beautiful strange distant landscape  you can see beyond the tree line and the hills that jut up from the floor the crystalline  structure that seems to mark the center of the island and that is where we 
none	 left off what would  you guys like to do  laura did you say the sand is made of pearls  matt it appears to be yeah the granules of the sand are too big to be tiny sand granules theyre  about pearlsize maybe a little bit smaller and theyre smooth and they seem to reflect the light  in a very beautiful way  laura i just want to take a handful and look at them  ashley oh can we make a body scrub  laura good idea pike im going to take a good handful 
none	 and put it in a pouch and save them  sam microdermabrasion  laura theyre microplastic beads that have washed up on the shore  ashley im going to take a little bit too  matt okay so you gather up some of these pearlescent beads of some kind and fill a small  pouch of them and put it amongst the rest of your belongings all righty anything else you guys  wish to do to prepare what do you want to do  sam oh god were going to go see sarenrae right  travis yeah you know 
none	 like one does fucking jauntily walk up  liam distorted and you said that that tower was full of some sort of flame right  sam sorry robot liam  marisha no i wanted two cheeseburgers what did you say  liam in speakandspell voice i am richer for having known you  travis thank you  much better  matt what did you say  liam i said robot noises you said that that tower had was full of some sort of flame right  matt yes and the what little you can see it seems to form this torso 
none	 of a feminine structure  the body of which gives out these wings that curl upward held amongst the center of these wings is  a large gemlike flame and you see within the actual crystalline well call it like a palace  if you will it looks like theres a light source within that flickers and dances like an eternal  bonfire or flame and it seems to have a pulse to it  liam im sure this is unnecessary but im going to start thinking about setting the death  walkers ward to fire damage  matt okay 
none	 so you guys want to take a short rest to do so  laura and sam oh  marisha do we need a short rest  liam its a 20minute thing well i dont have to if everyone else wants to start  sam were not in a rush right 20 minutes wont kill us  laura i guess sure  matt okay so you take the better part of an hour half an hour or so 40 minutes or so for a  short rest to reset your armor to fire resist any other preparations  sam yeah well 
none	 hey im no expert on the religious arts but we have this eye of doom with  us should we really be bringing this into a holy place of goodness  laura i dont know  taliesin i think if anything it might be even less effective here  sam but what if it knows where we are and can somehow get an advantage and kill sarenrae or  something i dont know  laura i feel like we should definitely ask sarenrae about it but its a little late to get  rid of it now  taliesin other 
none	 than your pocket dimension  marisha its in the bag of holding right  travis nope  ashley i have it i have the eyeball in the box  sam is it still in the box can you shake the box and make sure theres something still in there  laura dont open the box  sam dont open the box just shake it  laura does it feel like theres an eyeball if you shake it just shake it and feel does it shake  around  matt rattling noise it does rattle a little bit like a peeled 
none	 wet grape you hear it sloshing  around inside  ashley laughs ew  taliesin best halloween trick ever  travis can you crush the tiny granules on the ground in between your fingers if you try really  hard  matt do you try  travis yeah i try real hard  matt okay you pick one up and you grunts push make a strength check  travis 23  matt grunts and strains no  laura whoa theyre titanium pearls  marisha it would be good for microdermabrasion  laura it really would wow  ashley could i 
none	 put my hand in the water just a doot  matt you step back a bit to where the shore is the water is gently brushing against the shore and  then pulls back theres no heavy waves the current is this steady almost relaxing  undulating sound this steady whoosh you reach over and place your hand within and you feel the  water soak into the inside of the plates of your gauntlet its warm its probably the equivalent  of a good 75 80 degrees it would be wonderful beach water  ashley okay guys it feels 
none	 so nice should we go for just a little bit of a swim while he attunes  to his  sam probably yes  marisha i walk over to pike and put my feet in the water with her stand on the edge  travis me too  taliesin oh also  liam i put my cold feet in since i have no shoes  taliesin wow  laura shameful  travis is there a sun a point of light in the sky  matt the sky is gently dappled with faint wisps of cloud and is blue and beautiful 
none	 but you do not  see a particular sun in the sky though the light seems to be everpresent what faint shadows you  see seem to be almost from multidirectional light there is no actual sun in the sky that you  can see  travis the light appears everpresent strange  laura wow grog  travis ow  laura im going to keep an eye out see if theres any movement in the fields while hes  attuning his armor  matt perception check please  laura 24  matt all right as you guys sit there waiting 
none	 on the edge of the shoreline keeping a watch across  the waters and the edges of where the beach begins to slowly form into the rolling hills and the  sparse bits of trees that you see marking the interior of the island theres no change its  almost like whatever pattern is here is a set pattern or at least any alterations or changes  would be over a very prolonged period of time you see no signs of any other life you see no signs  of any other beings walking within your immediate eyesight  laura 
none	 does it feel nice  matt it feels nice it feels comfortable its welcoming if a little quiet  travis when this rest is over do we know what direction were going in  laura marisha and taliesin towards the tower  travis jeez not everybody at fucking once all right shit  marisha well you had such good observation skills with the whole everpresent light thing  travis what does that mean  marisha man youre always a surprise and after so many years  travis thank you  marisha i look at pike i say pike this place 
none	 is beautiful its incredible and i dont think  we would be here if it wasnt for you and your connection to sarenrae and im honored to be here  with all of you all and to see this place with vax this makes me happy just this moment this  is nice sighs i love you all  sam we love you too  laura we love you too keyleth  ashley i love you kiki  sam just to be clear  marisha and i use my inspiring leader feat  laughter  sam i was just about 
none	 to ask was that wellthoughtout speech inspirational  matt all right so level 18 that you are with no charisma modifier correct everyone gains 18  temporary hit points  travis damn  laura are we all healed up and healthy now  matt you did take a long rest yeah  taliesin oh we did take a long rest  matt there were some healing spells spent on pikes end and dealing with the eye that was  recovered i think and then you with the plane shift  sam me and grog got shot a few times  
none	 matt yeah you got to heal a little bit  sam but i can use some hit dice  matt yes you can during the short rest  laura these boots of haste i dont have to attune to them theyre not attunable right or  do i have to attune to them  liam yes darling they are theyre attunable  laura okay thats fine then im just going to unattune my bracers and attune my boots of haste  that i have on im going to spend the next ten minutes cleaning them up and making them look 
none	  really pretty  taliesin you know youre going to get them back next long rest  matt all right so youve attuned to the boots of haste  sam yes  laura im going to get so much shit online  matt broomgate 20 laughs  liam no its exactly what you would do when you almost lose somebody  travis laughs keep it coming  marisha im so proud hes as cold as his skin is right now  laura dont die anymore  liam its in character i mean dont give her a hard time  matt 
none	 all right so you guys finish resting it is comfortable it is nice here and especially in  the rush of the current state of things this brief moment of respite feels so removed from that  race that chaos that everpresent fear and doubt and later you know whether its the  surroundings or the general nature of the plane that youre in but its soothing its  comforting as you finish your attunement to the item you finish your new attunement to your  resistance you guys gather your things step out of the water put your footwear 
none	 back on and what  would you like to do  sam walk towards the busty lady  matt whats the marching order  taliesin oh really  laura were going to have to fight things in this beautiful place  ashley ill go first  taliesin ash in front  matt okay ashleys in front whos next  travis im with pike  matt all right grogs right up there with pike  laura ill be behind grog  taliesin ill be with you  laura lovely  liam im going to trail sheepishly behind keyleth  marisha i 
none	 was about to say i dont leave vaxs side  laura trinket is out  matt trinket is out  laura and he is walking between behind me and percy yeah  sam and as always ill enjoy the rear  travis yeah you will  matt okay then all righty so with pike leading on and approaching the pathways that lead towards  the center of the island the rolling hills ascend higher and higher the further towards where the  distant crystal monolith resides up from the soft pearllike sand to reveal large obelisks of  carved rectangular 
none	 stone at offkilter angles jutting out of the ground in places you had seen  some of these at a distance when you arrived and you as well in your vision pike earlier the  trees you walk past begin to slowly thin out to replace some of these stone structures you can  see whats almost this outer ring of nature that encloses the inner portion of this island  the wind is now warm against your skin as it begins to whip through this area and you can hear  it tear through some of the openings between 
none	 these ever densely growing clusters of stonework  occasionally these stone structures resemble figures of old ancient figureheads from the age of  arcanum who bore the embrace of the everlight with them before her following fell from grace  you can see the ravages of time and the diminishing of her influence following the  divergence are shown on some of these figures as they appear to be sheared or cracked or broken in  places but still no sign of anything else moving on the island  taliesin does it look like people are avoiding us or does 
none	 it look like this is not a place of  matt make a perception check  taliesin all right i had a funny feeling you would say that 12  matt you see no signs of any movement any foot tracks no signs of anything in the vicinity that  would lead you to believe that youre being avoided or being watched  liam does it look like anyone has been here for a very long time  matt make an investigation check  liam oh im not going to waste luck on that thats a one i have no 
none	 idea whats going in this  fucking place  matt pike you lead on you make your way through these tangled paths and they shift and curve and  turn and the light never seems to change overhead and as you hike along and chat amongst yourselves  and keep open to the vicinity around you and youre breathing in the clean air with hints of  seaspray and saltiness that eventually makes its way through the breeze you can feel parts of you  sweat beneath your armor from the general warmth of the atmosphere and you travel for 
none	 about an  hour pike and vex and vax and keyleth you pick up on this too the crystalline structure in the  center of the island doesnt appear to be any closer  travis shit  marisha didnt we go through something like this before  taliesin we literally went through this before  laura we had really think about being there is that what we had to do  liam yes pike do you think you need to talk to her somehow or call to her somehow  ashley yeah okay im going to pull out the key 
none	 again  matt okay the metallic loop the curved piece of metal okay  ashley yeah  travis quietly there is no spoon  ashley sarenrae we have travelled very far and we are here and if you  could give us any guidance to get closer to you i would be forever grateful  matt you say this out loud  ashley yeah  matt okay you look out before you still staring at the crystal structure no response  ashley okay i repeat that again in my head  matt okay so you say it back to yourself 
none	 in your head  ashley yeah  travis ticking them off one at a time here we go  matt okay so you look forward at the crystalline structure looking at its form and focus on those  words on the inside of your head no response  laura maybe we have to let her know were here  sam pikeypoo pikeypants you had a religious thing and talked to your god right  ashley say again  sam you talked to sarenrae briefly right  ashley yeah  sam did she invite you or all of us  laura 
none	 oh shit is this a thing where you think youre invited to a party so you bring your whole  crew and then maybe realize they werent invited  sam do you want to walk solo for ten minutes and see if you are solo getting any closer  taliesin well keep you in ear contact  liam is this like party hopping at comic con  laura yeah get us on the list once youre in there then well join you in line  taliesin see how many wristbands you can get  ashley okay ill keep walking and 
none	 ill keep looking back thumbs up and ill see what i can  find  matt okay you walk forward and you can look back at your friends and you continue to walk forward  towards the structure you eventually begin to weave between these stone obelisks which get  dense and overlap to the point where maybe about a hundred feet ahead you lose sight of  pike  laura i want to get on my broom and fly up in the air and see if i can see her from the air  matt okay you fly up 
none	 in the air and you look down and you see her shes right beyond where you  lost sight of her originally and shes walking forward  laura okay okay how you doing pike  ashley good good just traveling over these stone structures  matt all right you watch pike you walk for another ten minutes or so on your own and you  watch her travel and as you focus shes travelling but shes still the same distance from  everyone else she was when she left she went just beyond eyeline and then its weird like it 
none	  doesnt make sense you watched her maneuver and change and shift around things yet she hasnt  gotten any further or any closer  marisha so is it like a sidescrolling background  matt in a way i guess  laura what and i turn around and the ocean is still where it was behind us pike  ashley does it look like ive gotten far i feel like ive gone real far  laura i dont think youve gone far at all dear i think youre in the same place  taliesin ive got a weird theory  
none	 marisha is the terrain repeating itself what was your theory  taliesin maybe this is visionbased maybe we have to close our eyes  laura how did we do this before  travis i like this lets walk with our eyes closed  laura maybe we just have to think really hard about being at the tower  travis i close my eyes and i start walking straight ahead  matt laughs as grog closes his eyes and starts walking  laura i close my eyes and think really hard about being directly in front of the tower  matt 
none	 okay anybody else want to do anything  marisha i start walking the opposite direction  travis eyes closed or open  marisha away from the tower with my eyes open  liam i stand confused and watch kiki leave us  matt okay keyleth turns away  taliesin i spin three times in a circle  matt what are you doing pike  ashley im going to stand there and think about being closer to the tower with my eyes closed  matt okay you all begin to close your eyes and begin walking and start wandering in different 
dung	  directions and bumping into pieces of stonework  sam bunch of cockroaches when you turn on the light  matt pike you close your eyes for a moment and concentrate and your vision is dark you dont  see the world around you but within a few seconds of embracing this darkness a sudden burst of  light appears ahead of you and you see a burning beacon visible in the direction where the crystal palace  was before you  sam just pike  matt just pike  ashley so ill try keeping my eyes closed and start 
none	 walking towards it  matt okay as you guys are figuring yourself out and you are concentrating so hard on being  there  marisha i turn around is the tower any closer  matt nope  marisha is it further  matt yep  marisha shit i walk back  matt okay you join the rest of the group and you watch half your party still stumbling into pieces  of stone pike you with your eyes closed still seeing this burning beacon this circular  sphere wreathed in flame that just licks up as the flames slowly burn 
none	 out of the bottom of this  structure and flicker off into nothing you step for about two minutes or so in its direction and  the heat gets warmer and warmer and warmer and then you open your eyes for a moment and youre  right in front of it  ashley hey guys can you see me  laura and sam can we hear her  matt you guys can hear her yeah  laura oh shit i open my eyes  matt you look down and shes right in front of the crystal structure  laura she 
none	 got all the fucking way there what did you do pike  ashley i just thought about it i closed my eyes and i started walking  laura thats what i fucking did  travis yeah i did too ow  laura open your eyes grog  marisha i walked the other way and it definitely didnt work  sam what is she doing that were not doing her hair is partially blue maybe we should dye our  hair blue as well  ashley maybe you can only get here if youre a believer of sarenrae  sam oh 
none	 im a believer can i try  ashley singing im a believer  sam all right  matt you close your eyes  sam yeah im going to clutch my symbol of sarenrae and im going to close my eyes and im  going to see if anything happens  matt you sit there in silence for about a minute and a half as the darkness is there before you  pitch black and youre clutching the symbol as hard as you can with your fingers to the point  where its almost hurting your hand and you see the 
none	 faintest distant flicker  sam im going to go towards it  matt you guys watch scanlan eyes closed begin walking towards the crystalline structure  laura its working for him  taliesin im going to follow him  laura im going to try to follow him im not going to aim for the tower im going to try to  get to pike  matt okay so youre going straight for pike  laura yeah  matt okay and youre following scanlan  taliesin yeah just nonchalantly  matt okay vax keyleth grog  marisha what do we do 
none	  travis im not going anywhere  ashley come on grog  travis im confused i want to see what happens to those two when they follow  matt so what are you guys doing  liam how is it working what are you guys doing  marisha theyre believers  sam maybe you guys have to believe  liam well i think that the existence of a pantheon of gods is a wellestablished fact in our  world so i believe  sam so poetic  marisha do i have to believe deeper than that  taliesin i think 
none	 perhaps you need reverence  matt scanlan and percival disappear into the brush ahead of you guys as youre having this  conversation you rushing towards pike as youre going towards her youre not getting any closer  you can see things rushing past you but theres some disconnect that as soon as you begin  to change focus youre right where you were grog and scanlan scanlan you step forward and that  beacon becomes brighter and warmer and you feel the warmth and you open your eyes and youre there  next to pike in front of the 
none	 palace and grog you walked alongside scanlan and you walked as he  watched and you went past the brush and suddenly youre at the palace  travis im there  matt yeah sorry not grog percy was you stayed back i misremembered  liam i grab keyleths hands  matt percival thats my fault so percival you made it past the boundary with scanlan  laura how did you how did shit we should have followed pike  marisha but percy you dont believe in anything this is bullshit  taliesin i believe in plenty of things but yeah 
none	 no i agree this is bullshit  laura im going to close my eyes and be like sarenrae i really believe in you youre so holy  and very divine and beautiful and i think you do really good things for pike and im very happy  about that  matt you concentrate a minute two minutes five minutes  laura fuck this is not working  taliesin pike pike do you want to collect the rest of them and lead them back here  liam i scoop up keyleths hands and i say you trust me right  marisha 
none	 yeah  liam yeah yeah you know that good feeling that you have when you hang out with pike you know  that warm feeling you have toasting marshmallows with her around the fire that kind of feeling  marisha yeah  liam you know that comes from sarenrae so focus on that with me and well go to pike focus on  sarenrae and that marshmallow feeling  marisha but that comes from pike not from sarenrae  liam you know thats partially true but not all true come on give it a shot  marisha okay i try 
none	 really hard  matt to  marisha think about the marshmallowy goodness that is sarenrae  matt okay vax and keyleth do this and then what do you do  liam close our eyes and show reverence to her  matt okay another five six minutes of darkness passes your eyes are closed no beacon nothing  ashley okay how long will it take me to walk back to them  matt do you walk back to them  ashley i want to walk back to them  matt okay a minute you emerge from the brush and you walk 
none	 and see keyleth and vax eyes closed  clutching hands just hoping and grog looking bored as hell  ashley okay wheres vex  laura im up here dear  ashley okay come here i have an idea okay so everybody hold onto me somehow  travis hold hands like preschool  ashley yeah  laura like a train  ashley yeah just dont let go and im going to think real hard and maybe well all be there  together  laura and travis okay  marisha okay we have to walk though right  travis eyes closed  
none	 laura all right im not closing my eyes im just holding onto pikes hand  marisha im still thinking about marshmallows though  travis thinking about bacon  liam i grab pike by the earlobe  ashley that tickles  matt and pike do you close your eyes and follow that beacon once more  ashley yes  matt okay as you guys walk alongside focusing on pike and her leading this small pack of friends  along through the heavily rolling hills and the pieces of stone obstruction that force you to make your  way around you help 
none	 guide her around these various obstructions that get in the way pike  youre concentrating on this burning beacon of warmth ahead of you and within three minutes of  travel it seemed almost closer than when you saw her disappear before you guys look at  her and glance up and youve just come across the threshold of the stones and youre now in this  open sandy patch at the base of this large crystal structure  laura nice good job pike  travis pikeypoo  ashley look at this  matt so now standing laughs  laura 
none	 laughing its beautiful  ashley its so much more beautiful up close  matt standing before this magnificent glasslike structure you can see the winding shapes and  edges clearly ascending in the form of a female torso rising from beneath the sands to a  staggering height two wings of glittering crystal curving upward to frame a massive round red gem  that shines above the head of the woman with flames curling from the inside of the facets this  red gem would probably be about twice the size of grog its hard to see the actual height 
none	 of it  here but its probably close to a hundred feet tall the entire structure  now you see the shifting flicker of the intense fire that burns within the palace now its  causing the shadows cast by all nearby things to dance behind you and in the inside you can see  what appears to be a heavy bonfire almost that is visible beyond a 20foot domed doorway right  at the base of the torso as you begin to approach the entrance to this crystalline palacelike statue  the heat of those flames that you see 
none	  inside roaring and burning quickly get hotter  and hotter on your skin and as you begin to enter the interior of this structure the heat feels  like it should be getting close to unbearable but it never hurts you acknowledge the temperature  change and youre used to knowing this much heat should hurt but it never does its just hot and  welcoming you now stand within the hollow interior of this incredible wonder looking at a  spiraling red tower of orangered flame that reaches up about 60 feet or so in this spiral  
none	 its all flame this large bonfire in the center of this structure it flares rhythmically like a  very intentional heartbeat roaring flames giving these whipping sounds of the heat and the  wind and the air that its tossing upward and out into the rest of the island around you and you now  begin to acknowledge the warm winds that were blowing through the island all seem to be  centering and spiraling out from the center of the island  and its at that point that you see something in the flame begin to take shape you 
dung	 watch as this  dark outline begins to open up as two large wings unfurl from within revealing feathers of ivory  and pearl like the beach you arrived on as this 15foottall feminine vision of sarenrae emerges  from the roaring pyre long curling flames burn as her hair from her beautiful dark skin framing a  warm and motherly smile her eyes gold and brown like the most polished brass her robes of light  blue unfurl in endless strands that almost seem to tether her to the inferno behind her and as she  emerges from the 
none	 flame you cant help but find yourself stunned and awed at the presence her  standing there unsinged from the flames slowly descends still floating above you her arms out  her wings and hair unfurled almost like a canopy above the group as you look up at her her face  turns and smiles onto small pike on the ground and you hear her voice for the first time for all  of you but not the first for pike who has heard her voice for a very long time my pike you come  to me after all 
dung	 this time such a beacon in a very dark world welcome  ashley i take a knee thank you for letting us come here its just such an honor to be in your  presence and to meet you in person ive been a believer of yours for my whole life and to  actually be here in front of you is very humbling  matt she descends faintly her massive form slowly seems to not shrink but shift perspective  a bit where once she was this massive entity before you seems almost human in size as the hand 
dung	  comes down and reaches and touches the top of pikes forehead and just runs down the nose onto  her chin and you see the brow furrow a bit as she says you vanished from my sight you walk paths  cast in shadow my sands whisper thoughts of sorrow and foreboding i must know from you all  what dark tidings bring you before me harboring such emotion  ashley well i think last time we spoke we took on a battle that we were not able to complete and  we need your help  matt what 
none	 type of foe do you face  laura you know vecna  matt she looks to you a bit theres a faint bit of recognition this entity this vecna is  clouded even in history i know little myself and with my sands they know little of this undying  king i imagine by his own design  laura he deals in secrets its kind of his thing  matt what can you tell me  taliesin we have a piece of him  laura we do  sam yes maybe well we can tell you that he is awful 
none	 evil pure evil incarnate and he wants to  be a god  liam he has eyes on your territory  marisha he is something of a demigod now you could say and well on his path to ascension  matt ascension  marisha he wants to be like you  matt how  marisha or i guess he wants to be like the raven queen  matt you watch the flames grow a little more cool a little more of a deeper red in color and  the brow furrows more and she pulls back a little bit from 
none	 pike not in a retraction but a worried  sense that seems to fill the room the brightness of the outside sky seems to dim ever so slightly  ascension the raven queen you say  marisha he could tell you more but i know she was a mortal who rose to her godhood and i know  hes looking for a similar path  matt impossible  marisha weve seen it  laura hes been working on it for a very long time  liam and obviously hungry for power  matt the wings still unfurled the tips seem 
none	 to almost curl in a bit as she as opposed to  floating above you out and about is now standing tall floating above the ground about five or six feet  her vision her eyes seem to drift from you and look out past the glass and crystal to the distant  shores beyond as she speaks out exclaiming the thoughts as they come across her mind sarenrae  says the ritual of seeding is one of the matron of ravens design it is the secret rite that  rebirthed her from her mortal trials and granted her the 
none	 powers to take her place among the prime  gods and become custodian to the realms between life and death fate and the cold of winter but  this ritual was summarily cast from all knowledge and sealed intent for eternity by all who walk  the paths of divinity none should know this none should know this  laura what about the goddess ioun the goddess of knowledge would she have known  matt she was the one who spearheaded its destruction  laura vecnas been taking over her chapels temples  matt i know not where ioun is 
none	 she is hidden away the dawnfather would know more than i they  were together when she was wounded if this ritual has come into the hands of another mortal where  is this mortal now  taliesin we have his eye in a box its powerful and intelligent  ashley i take out the box  marisha hes slowly staked out on the prime material plane just north of vasselheim about  350 miles  laura recently completed a ritual in the shadowfell  matt if hes finished the seed hes already on his way  laura oh no 
none	  marisha what does that mean how can we stop him  matt the ritual takes some time from what i recall i dont know how long i was not its  architect i was not the one who sealed it ioun would be the one to ask however if this is  completed then the accord of the divergence is in danger if we will have one god on one side of the  divine gate and the others on the other we could not stop him understand in order for any of us  to directly interfere to 
none	 seal a god like we did once long ago we would have to tear down the  divine gate and that would release an entirely new armageddon upon your world so either you stop him  and seal him or you live amongst the only god we cannot stop  laura how do we seal away a god  matt i dont know i was betrayed during the calamity i was not present when they began to  seal the betrayer gods youd do best to speak with maybe some of the others who were more  prominent in that 
none	 time you walk in elysium this is the realm also of pelor  laura the dawnfather  matt yes  travis might i ask does kord reside in elysium  matt no but you could perhaps speak with him too i dont know much about kord we dont see  eye to eye and if you could see a goddess glance sidelong with embarrassment this is the closest  youd ever see ive fallen from import over recent years until recently  sam you  travis no  matt she looks down at pike for a minute until recently and 
none	 turns back to scanlan and says  and dont think your prayers have gone unheard as well  sam you heard im new at praying im sorry for all the cursing at first i had a lot of emotions  and i didnt know if anyone was listening apologies but you heard me at night  matt when your heart was true to it yes  sam wow you wont tell anybody will you because some of that is personal stuff  matt she smiles and averts her gaze from you do you know if this mortal this man this 
none	 vecna do  you know in your heart of hearts pike that this man is beyond redemption is there any spark of  hope in his heart to turn him back to the light  ashley well i would always hope that in somebody but at least the time spent with him  that we have it doesnt seem that thats his path  matt well i trust in your insight and this is your judgment to make the greatest judgment you  may ever make as you walk this path closer to conflict with this entity search yourself for 
none	 any  glimmer and if there is no redemption to be had then smite him with all the might i have granted  you  ashley okay  laura hes not doing a lot of talking to us  travis a lot of killing disintegrating  sam how will we know if hes a god or not  matt youll know we all will know  laura so it hasnt happened yet  matt not yet  laura okay  marisha how long do these seeding rituals usually take how much time do we have  matt i dont know 
dung	 you would have to ask those who were responsible for sealing it  travis dawnfather  marisha im so confused thats it we didnt walk away from him unscathed the first time and  were just supposed to try again  matt even in the dark days of the calamity the might of our weapons could only diminish the  betrayers who rose against creation the two that orchestrated our victory and designed the means of  sealing away such terrible evil ive already mentioned they would be of more aid than i the  knowing mistress ioun as wounded 
none	 and hidden away as she is and the dawnfather warden to the  chained oblivion his fortress across the fields of elysium i could send you there  taliesin that would be quite helpful  travis it was hard getting here  laura will he be as accepting as you  matt i dont know i havent spoken much with the others in some time  laura you should throw a party invite them all get to know them again  matt she looks down at pike once more my pike youve done more than you know youve been a 
none	  guiding light for these wonderful champions and so many more she reaches down and lifts you off the  ground a bit looking at your face the bit of sadness that creeps across it as she lifts you up  and you guys watch as she glides passing through the crystal pike being brought below the archway  as she just lifts her out beyond this crystal structure she ascends upward about 25 30 feet or  so holding pike in her hands out in front of her  and just chucks her  laughter  matt no holding 
none	 her close and by this point sarenraes form has expanded to almost the size of  the crystal structure you came to you can now see a parallel between her wings and her form and her  torso as to the actual incredible presence of this god before you and leans in as she shows the  island to pike below and whispers close to your ear im not lonely here pike for my sands  remain with me speak with me and we learn from each other look as she extends her arm pike  you look out and 
none	 all of the light of the sky seems to shine at once through every pearl every  grain of the beach sand that youve walked across and where once you saw what was just a barren  landscape you now see thousands and thousands and thousands of people opaque translucent souls of  those that have come to sarenrae since the dawn of creation those who swore themselves to good under  her banner and at the end of their lives came to become part of the island of renewal and forever  live with her and amongst the rest 
none	 of the community of people that are warmed under her  light they all seem to look up at once at you and you sense them smiling as the vision fades  and the island goes back untouched  she drifts back down and places you on the ground you see one day you will join us too and we  will all have so many stories to share you now see her hovering over all of you as you step out  of this to join pike on the exterior of this tower while i am diminished my powers 
none	 limited  you do possibly face something terrible unseen since the calamity and for this journey pike i  grant you my blessing  and as she reaches her hands out and they expand her head lifts up her eyes close and her wings  flare into a phoenixlike flame that just emblazons the sky with light and fire the heat is  more intense than anything youve felt yet still theres no pain its just allconsuming its  like the rebirth of a phoenix and youre all surrounded by it for a moment its all there is  in 
none	 existence just this incredible entity and then the flames slowly die away except for the flames  that currently engulf pikes gnome form and as the flames burn away you can see on pike the  familiar set of wings youve seen her spiritual form hold which fold in and then dissipate you  now have the blessing of the everlight  cheering  ashley oh my goodness what is that  matt you get a plustwo bonus to your constitution  ashley okay  travis well take a picture and text it to you  ashley okay  matt 
none	 as a bonus action you can summon the wings of the everlight granting you a flying speed of  40 feet for up to ten minutes and while you have these wings any spells you cast that cause  creatures to regain hit points heal an additional ten hit points  cheering  matt but once this ability is used you cant use it for another seven days  all oh  ashley man i love her so much  matt so if you want to take a picture and send that to her here we go hold onto that 
none	 and give  it to her  marisha is sarenrae gone  matt no sarenrae is still there just the flames have burned away  laura im going to send this to you ashley  taliesin im right here guys its really not cool  ashley oh man  laura since sarenrae is still standing there i want to say to her shit  travis good start  laura shit sorry i want to apologize this feels so stupid i want to apologize for never  realizing what you are and what this could be and for not showing you 
none	 the reverence that you  deserve and i hope to change that in the future and i will certainly think differently from here  on out  matt as you look down and look up where once she was this large entity above you you look down and  look up and shes right before you no apologies necessary the creation of exandria the peoples  that populate it and develop and design innovate and worship was with free will to make your own  path faith is important to some but the intent was to instill you with the 
none	 means of doing and  choosing whatever and however you like we do not wish reverence of all just those who find us at  least i speak for myself  laura well i think youre pretty wonderful  matt there is balance to everything  laura and i took these from your beach it doesnt seem right  matt she takes the pouch from you and pours it out and as the pearls are about to land they  drift off and dart off back to the location where you originally found them  ashley same i just thought 
none	 i wanted to take a little piece with me but i already have that i  didnt know what it was  matt as you empty the pearls they also dart off towards the beach where you first landed  laura i just thought they were really pretty  ashley i would have told you before we left you know  matt its all right but for everything great that we may have created you continue to create  far better our existence brings threat weve brought two calamities before we try and avoid a  third whether we diminish 
none	 in time or just maintain this balance its you and your  children and your childrens children that hold the keys to the future of your lives your people  your culture and us so dont apologize  travis would you say sarenraes attractive  matt are you asking her or is this a question to me as the dm  travis yeah that one  matt shes beautiful i wouldnt put it in terms of any sort of a sexual object  travis shes just beautiful  matt shes just an incredibly beautiful powerful feminine form and to the 
none	 extent where  grog who usually being a man whos driven by base needs not a single thought comes across you in  any base or defacing way it is too powerful it overwhelms it  travis yeah no shes beautiful  marisha what are titties  laura what even are titties  marisha what do titties  travis im keeping my little pearl from the beach  marisha laughs that youve been trying to crush  travis yeah  laura terrible matts like shady shit  travis were going to need one yall gave yours back  taliesin its 
none	 going to be like the wonka factory its just its going to turn on you  matt you stole fizzy lifting drinks you now have to be watched  taliesin pearls from the beach you get nothing sir good day  matt laughing good day sir  travis its just one  matt i know you have my blessing pike do this for me do this for them do this for you do this  for all of creation and do it soon the longer you wait well the longer you wait do you wish  to be off to 
none	 the dawnfather  sam yes time is of the essence we should go right away  marisha is he as warm and welcoming and nice as you are  matt laughs  marisha okay thats a good answer  matt with a bright white flash emanating from her torso and arms your vision just goes white and  you all blink for a moment as your head spins for but a brief instant your feet touch hard ground  and you all immediately reach up and rub your eyes and as your vision slowly coalesces once  more you find 
none	 yourself standing in the deep center of some vast orchard surrounded by an  endless sea of fruitbearing trees of all sizes shapes and colors intertwined the canopy broken  and sparse in places where you can see above a clear blue cloudless sky youre no longer on  the island of renewal thats for sure  laura oh i thought but isnt that where the dawnfather is  matt island of renewal is where sarenrae is the blessed fields of elysium is the plane he existed  elsewhere in there  laura i understand now  marisha is there 
none	 the same everlight sky  matt make a nature check  marisha everpresent sorry everpresence in light i use my druidic die 29 sorry 31  matt its hard to see from down low because the canopy does choke it a bit you can see bits of  the sky that appear blue cloudless whereas you saw wisps of cloud over the island this appears  clear you can climb up a bit and try to get a better look if you want  marisha sure  matt okay so you begin to leap up through the branches and a 
none	 lot of the trees here have winding  and knotted branches so its pretty easy to find your way up the canopy after maybe a five minute  climb you get up and peek over and you can see now this orchard goes on for miles and miles and  miles filling this vast valley that you can barely see mountains that crest the edge of it in  the distance near the horizon you also see there is no cloud in the sky and there is no sun but  there is a single pillar of light that streaks 
none	 down from way way up the zenith striking down in  the center of this orchard where there you see before you this aweinspiring sight of the  dawnfathers home a goldplated citadel of many humongous towers and spires that both resembles a  military fortress and the largeststeepled church youve ever seen its hard to gauge distance with  so many trees between you and it you dont know if its miles off from you if its maybe a  thousand feet or so but even at this distance its incredible in its scale  marisha oh hey guys 
none	 pelors not messing around  travis they make really tall things here  laura i fly up next to keyleth so i can see wow do you think this is like sarenrae where we cant  get to him unless we have him in our heart  marisha you know i feel a little bit more connected here this i can its trees im  surrounded by trees this i can relate to  laura i mean ive tried to talk to pelor before  marisha ive talked to the sun tree gasps i wonder if the sun tree is 
none	 here maybe hes got a  twin here like you have a twin  laura maybe  taliesin do i recognize any of the fruit thats growing on the trees  matt make a nature check  taliesin yeah 15  marisha decent for a city boy  matt its interesting this orchard various fruits thrive in various climates as you begin to  walk a little bit through it is a peppering of all sorts of trees and fruits you see apples of  all shades you see oranges you see rare passion fruits you see floralbased growing fruit 
none	 its a  perpetual harvest here  laura i rush down and say dont eat the fruit  sam might be souls  laura i think it might be souls  travis no its fruit souls dont grow on trees  marisha souls also dont wash up on beaches but apparently they do  taliesin that may be the most interesting thing i think youve ever said is souls dont grow on  trees  marisha and taliesin souls dont grow on trees  marisha at least he knows the dangers of monocultures this is very impressive  taliesin yeah 
none	 this is theres a lot of variety  travis what  matt whatre you guys doing  liam vax is off on his own by the way sitting on his ass having a moment because it wasnt too  long ago when he had a thing for sarenrae and that was pretty bittersweet so hes staring off  into space  matt okay  travis one piece of fruit one piece just one little piece an apple  sam no  travis were in elysium oh my god please  taliesin if you do eat anything and you shouldnt but 
dung	 if you do eat anything eat  something you dont recognize itll be funnier that way  travis is there any fruit that i dont recognize  matt make an investigation check  taliesin deadpan no dont stop  travis something i dont recognize 12  matt yeah actually you guys walk for about three or four minutes in the direction of where  you saw the fortress and you come across what looks to be a small bush thats clustered near  this dark wooden tree with a thick gnarled exterior and this bush has these small ripe  
none	 plumlike fruits that come to a point at the bottom that youve never seen before  laura grog do not do not  travis what pick this  laura dont gasps  marisha gasps grog  taliesin i dare you not to eat it  marisha dont say that hell do it you know thats what happens  travis no why dont we say are you a person  taliesin whispers grog  travis nothing nothing you want to check it for magic  laura yeah im going to check it hello are you a soul  marisha yes im 
none	 a soul  laura gasps oh my god it is a soul it just spoke to me oh my god whats your favourite  color  marisha blue like your feather  laura it said blue like my feather did you hear it it was talking grog it was talking  travis hey pike  ashley dont eat it  travis what  laughter  ashley just in case  travis what do i do with it i already picked it  ashley i have an idea why dont you hold onto it keep it in your pouch  laura 
none	 not in the bag of holding keep it in your shirt pocket  travis when have i ever worn a shirt  ashley you can ask him if the fruit is edible and make sure its not people  travis thats fair all right i will hold onto the pointy plum  matt laughs okay  laura are we getting any closer to the citadel  matt you guys keep walking towards it  laura marisha and travis yeah  matt all right you walk on  laura are there any people does it look like theres tracks in this 
none	 orchard  matt actually vax vex and keyleth you notice fairly quickly in that you begin to see movement  ahead the air itself which by the way the wind here is carrying a very sweet and fragrant almost  like honey flower whiffs that come through in waves that hit you the whole atmosphere here  makes you hungry it makes you comfortable it reminds you of childhood in a strange way its a  very good positive atmosphere you begin to see as you approach figures moving pike you  recognize this because these are similar to the 
none	 vision you just had from sarenrae they are  entities they are souls they are people that walk the fields of elysium and you see them walk  with small satchels and you see them picking the fruit and gathering and harvesting they dont  seem to pay you too much mind and as you begin to get close to some of them they just stop and  watch you its very spirited away in a strange way you see these somewhat translucent entities  that barely acknowledge your existence and then as you pass by they go on to 
none	 whatever work they were  doing no speech you dont even see eyes or faces you just see the outline of the humanlike  shape various heights and sizes  laura but theyre picking the solid fruit  matt theyre picking the solid fruit and gathering them  taliesin are they eating the solid fruit  matt you dont see any of them immediately eating it  taliesin none of them are eating the fruit  marisha i have a feeling its an offering  travis i have a feeling its fucking fruit  marisha are we getting closer  
none	 matt you continue to walk and make sure to avoid some of the larger clusters of these various  harvesting entities these harvest souls you whos leading the charge this time whos leading  you through the orchards  taliesin one of you two is this technically favored terrain for you  matt it would count as a forest for you  laura yeah i guess ill be in the front percy have you done a lot of talking to pelor  taliesin not really no  marisha percy how do you feel about gods these days last time we 
none	 talked we were both not  optimistic i feel like  taliesin i know how to be polite im very reasonable at that  marisha reverence  taliesin reverence  liam you can certainly acknowledge when someone can squash you like a bug  taliesin yes  marisha but a lot of things can squish us like bugs i dont know this is complicated lets  just keep going im going to keep an eye out while were walking for anything that resembles  the sun tree  matt okay all right are you leading the way  laura yeah 
none	  matt because you have no sun to keep tabs on youre just going to have to fly up above the  canopy and keep an eye on it so youre cresting and descending through the orchard as you  progress you travel for about an hour and a half to two hours and you notice you are getting  closer but it is a long way away you probably have another three four hours of travel before  you get there on foot  laura its a long trek weve got a while  marisha i wonder if we 
none	 believe harder if well get there quicker  taliesin i dont believe thatll work  sam well lets just go  laura just keep on pushing on  sam yeah  laura right we dont have anything thatll make us move faster  taliesin well we have misty but that seems  laura that seems stupid  taliesin its a nice walk  laura yeah its beautiful  matt you guys continue your trek and as you get closer and closer to the fortress of the sun you  do notice the trees of the orchard grow taller and thicker 
none	 and its like whatever fertility  enchantment that runs this section of the plane the closer to the central portion of this fortress  you get the more the rampant wild growth seems to gather and expand to the point where it in some  places almost resembles the feywild though nowhere near as mysterious and threatening in some  cases but youve never seen apple trees that grow four stories tall but here you see them  and the scale is immense but the branches are as dense with apples and leaves as they would be  elsewhere it 
none	 continues to go its an impossible size to some of these trees and plants and bushes  it dwarfs your size by comparison to where you really get a sense of scale of how small you may  be in this realm versus some of the creatures that call it home  marisha see this tree can squash me like a bug if it fell on me yeah  laura i wonder if its apple grew as big as the actual tree if it fell youd be doomed  matt as you progress a few more hours into this trek 
none	 eventually vex you begin to notice the  light ahead begins to grow brighter  laura hey i think were getting closer  sam awesome  marisha does this feel like sunlight does it register like sunlight or is it a whiter light  laura like should we put some sunblock on as we walk towards it  marisha yeah is it sunlight temperature  matt it registers as a sunlight it is a pure light  taliesin like kitchen light white or like reading room light  matt like noon daylight light  travis arizona or california  matt 
dung	 and as you push closer and closer to where this brightness continues to expand and its  brighter than you anticipated youre getting to the edge of a clearing where the tree line comes to  a halt but as you do it hurts your eyes a little bit you have to adjust from the dark interior of  the forest to the outside and as you finally breach the edge of the tree line and look out you  can see this open clearing and immediately you can see the column of light thats cracking down  from the 
none	 center of the sky is what is lining this clearing where the light touches the trees stop  and it hurts a little bit to look at it because the light is reflecting off of this bright gold  brasscolored citadel before you you thought the crystal structure that sarenrae was in was you  know impressive this is four times larger than the largest structures in vasselheim or emon  youve ever encountered and you watch as this massive citadel it has maybe two dozen separate  towers of different heights that stagger and shift and they all come 
none	 to these steeplelike points  and there in the center of the structure is one thick massive tower that crawls upward and upward  and upward and upward for even at this point surmising 15 20 stories before the tip vanishes  into the bright light that is descending from the sky above you see the outline of a few sparse  trees that catch your attention you do see some trees that litter this open space within this  bright light that are of the same type of tree as the sun tree that resides in the center of 
none	  whitestone  marisha he does have a twin  laura do you think this tower is compensating for something or maybe its a representation hard to  tell  travis basically well know vecnas a god if another skyscraper forms in elysium somewhere  marisha how close are we to the column of light  matt youre stepping beyond the treeline and into the light so youre just at the edge of the tree  line  marisha i druidcraft a little twig and hold it into the light column  matt okay doesnt seem to affect it at 
none	 all  marisha nothing im going to touch it  matt its warm its like warm daylight  marisha okay were not going to die  laura thats good  travis are you sure  marisha no  laura laughs im going to look at the citadel with my eyes wide open for five seconds and then  close my eyes really fast to see if i can see better details of it like when you look at the  sun  matt laughs you do actually  liam i swat my sister in the forehead  laura hey im 
none	 doing stuff here its science  matt in closing your eyes yeah you can see the shape and the outline of the spires that go off  and you can see the plating and the large heavy structures and you can see the various windows  that dot the outside on multiple levels it looks like theres at least seven or eight different  levels of the actual fortress you see lines of windows and looks to be balconies that adorn it at  these different stages and at the top of that the towers go higher and higher its 
none	 almost like  a city of a fortress in its own right in its scale its impressive its like if you took part  of the city of brass and jammed it into one structure and made it pure gold  travis pure gold  matt its gorgeous  laura this is beautiful  matt laughs but it does burn the shit out of your eyes if you stare at it that long  laura worth it worth every second i like pelor i like him a lot  travis someone should go in and test out the light  
dung	 sam yeah lets just go in its just light  marisha maybe the light will take us there straight to him  travis i push vax in  marisha i jump in  matt you push vax in all right  liam oh warm again  laughter  matt its very warm and with your dark leather its like the goth kid in summer little sweaty  liam i was never the goth kid  matt you guys begin to make your way on foot trekking towards the center of this clearing  towards the fortress of the sun as 
none	 you begin to make your way beyond the various trees with their  blossoming beautiful white pink and purple blossoms that mark the sun tree during the spring  and summer you can now see along the perimeter of this what appear to be hundreds of figures  hundreds of figures that just dot the outside of the fortress and as you get a better look at some of  the spires you can see that on the upper levels including the one central tower you can see these  beautiful medallionlike circles of stained glass mosaics of color on 
none	 a scale that is impressive  you can only surmise maybe the smallest one being 20 feet in diameter and going up from there on the  scale on the central portions of it and whats interesting is usually with stained glass the bright  exterior the color is darkened and shaded because the light is once youre inside the structure but  the color is so vibrant in the stained glass you get the sense that there is a light source within  the actual fortress that is as bright if not brighter than the column of light that 
none	 is  descending from the sky  laura shouldve worn sunglasses here  matt as you begin to get closer and closer to the citadel once again the scale seems to build and  build what should seem to be a shorter walk gets longer and longer as you begin to see how massive  and far away this is compared to where you thought it was and about 30 minutes since you  left the treeline you begin to just get past the final bit of sun trees that are planted around the  exterior  marisha i touch 
none	 a few as i walk by see if i feel anything  matt theyre alive theyre vibrant and similar in texture as to the one youve spoken with in  whitestone  laura you going to try talking to them  marisha should i  laura and taliesin i dont know  travis do you know this tree  marisha i dont know maybe hes like a distant relative of the sun tree maybe i know him by  proxy  laura maybe theyre like oh yeah sun tree i remember him he got taken away as a seedling but 
none	  he was really great hows he doing  liam i mean you know you want to  travis its an elysium tree just saying  laura maybe they dont even speak our language its possible  liam this is a once in a lifetime opportunity kiki  marisha ill try and speak to one of the sun trees that looks the most friendly  travis laughing amicable tree  matt make a nature check see which one seems the most approachable of all the other trees  travis weigh the nuts  marisha thats a natural one i dont 
none	 know  matt you see one tree that looks definitely the most amiable of the ones in the field and you  approach it  marisha amiable  matt amicable pick your term  marisha amicable amiable all right ill talk to a tree thats what im going to do  matt as you finish your spell and reach out your finger touching the warm exterior of the tree the  lights still a little blinding but youve adjusted to it now where you can make out shapes  and color as opposed to the blaring white what do you 
none	 say  marisha hey sun tree bro are you a sun tree bro are you a sun tree brother whats your  name  matt im a tree of the sun and im not your bro  marisha no i didnt know if you knew the sun tree that grew in whitestone on the prime material  plane i didnt know if you knew him  matt so because im a tree of the sun you assume that i know all other trees of the sun is  that what this is its one of those things we all look 
none	 alike dont we just all of us trees of  the sun right  marisha can you tell me a little about this plane how do we talk to pelor how do we see  him  matt i recommend probably going towards the giant golden fortress that is right behind you  its probably a good place to look where all the lights coming from  marisha okay yeah wow i have a friend who wants to know about the fruit hes wondering if the fruit  is souls if he can eat the fruit  matt the fruit

none	 marisha my leaves are prickly  laura maybe he was just pretending he didnt like you because he felt uncomfortable because he likes  you so much like kash  marisha thats nice vex thanks you didnt talk to this guy okay you dont know  travis did you ask about the fruit  marisha yeah he said its fruit its fine you can eat it too youre right grog you were  right eat the fruit lets go come on  sam yikes  laura breathe in breathe out  matt all right you guys begin making your trek 
none	 back towards the fortress of the sun as youre  walking  marisha i rip off an apple as i go and i start aggressively eating it  matt the sun trees here dont bear fruit  marisha i fucking spike an apple that i had earlier  matt okay if you have an apple with you youre welcome to eat it if you wanted to  marisha no i just want to go in the tower  liam i lean over to percival and say this is one of those times when its best just to keep quiet  
none	 taliesin im so quietly delighted by this  matt all right as you guys begin to approach the fortress you watch as those hundreds of figures  you saw at the base are beginning to collect towards the front of what appears to be the large  doors that lead to this sides entrance to the actual structure as they gather they begin to  push in your direction you also see other figures up on the higher floors balconies almost  wingbeat whoosh glide and then flying in your direction rather rapidly  laura i hope theyre friendly hes 
none	 definitely not as solitary as sarenrae is he  matt at this point you watch as these winged entities three of them approach faster than the  rest of the horde that seems to be pushing in your direction you can see long goldenwhite wings  you see very intenselooking breastplates made of gold and brass with rubies marked into it  similar but not as well adorned as the armor that pike wears holding spears various other weapons  or shields but as they fly in and land impact noise landing they all stand about five or six  
none	 feet taller than all of you humanoid muscular almost roman in physique but their skin is a very  faint light blue their eyes are white  laura hunin and kyor  marisha are they devas celestials  angels  liam celestials  matt they have similar traits though apparently purer and much stronger than the halfblood  celestials that you had met previously in the city of brass  laura that we rescued didnt just meet them we saved them  matt you did and you gave them a new life under the remaining family of  laura hunin 
none	 and kyor i even got their fucking names right  matt you did which is awesome  liam the third time yeah  matt so as the three of them land impacts around you spears not aggressive but at their  side and powerful entities they triangulate around you all standing so much taller than you  do their wings still unfurled in a very prominent display of power their helmets covering everything  the helmet comes down over the nose and reveals the eyes its very roman in structure one of  them yells out you who approaches the 
none	 fortress what is your business here  travis guards best to let scanlan and i take this  laughter  liam percy do you want to flash a little whitestone bling at the moment  taliesin youre pretty whitestone blinged  laura were vox machina we were sent here to speak to pelor by the goddess sarenrae  matt sarenrae sent you  laura yes she did  matt with what business  laura to speak about a very big evil growing on the material plane  matt make a persuasion check  laura oh no okay 22  matt 
none	 okay the one guard that you were talking to looks over to the guard thats to the left of all  of you and he gives him this slight head nudge that one whos a little bit smaller than the other  two walks past and his pupilless white eyes which emanate this faint white glow seem to look  past each of you i say past each of you it almost is a piercing gaze as it looks at scanlan  it gives a little bit of an upturn of the nose a neutral disapproval of percival keyleth less 
none	 so  grog almost a sneer for a moment and then to vax and vex and then to pike a nod  sam oh a nod  laura shes good  matt he looks back to the first guard and says there is no evil among them  laura hear that grog youre not evil  travis yeah i knew that why didnt you just ask  taliesin we do it should be noted carry a dangerous artifact that we should warn you of  sam check in our weapons yeah  matt the one soldier that you were first 
none	 speaking to steps forward his heavy footfalls from his  armored boots he puts his hand out we will take this artifact  laura and sam hesitant noises will we get it back  matt what need do you have with a dangerous artifact  laura well it belongs to the great evil and so its possible that we can use it to defeat him so  if we dont have it we might not be able to do that  travis it may give us an advantage  laura could be really great  matt the dawnfather will be 
none	 the judge of that  laura okay  taliesin im all right with that  sam dont look at it though itll turn you super evil and youll rip out your eye  matt noted such a big thing and yet you shook it a little strangely very well follow us  please  sam hows that fruit  matt their wings fold behind them and they walk alongside you matching their gait to yours as  you move forward even with your brisk pace their gait is so long that theyre having to make long  slow strides to 
none	 keep up with your slow pace  laura i hold percys hand as were going in  taliesin yeah well do this together im all right  matt at this point the mass army thats been approaching you you can see now are hundreds of  armored spirits similar to those that you saw in the orchard as they approach the three planar  entities that are walking alongside you put their hand up in a dismissive motion and the army  parts leaving a singular path that leads you right to the front of the fortress and the path 
none	  because theres so many goes on its like walking through a parade of silence as you all  look around you cant make out any faces you see hundreds of sets of glittering golden armor with  the somewhatvisible form of these translucent spiritual entities that take up the space you  dont sense any hostility animosity you dont sense any welcoming you dont sense anything from  them theyre present and letting you pass  laura is the armor solid  matt yes the armor is solid and the spirits that inhabit them are pseudomaterial its hard  
none	 for you to gauge you havent encountered this type of creature outside of your spectral  encounters with ghosts and other spirits as you step forward being flanked and escorted by these  winged guards you are brought to the base of the 50 or so steps that ascend to the front 40foottall  double doors that now loud creaking creak open to reveal the interior of the palace which  is as bright if not brighter from the inside as the outside pillar of light youre leaving  as you prepare yourselves to adjust your gaze you ascend step 
none	 by step to eventually take in whatever  the interior of the fortress of the sun has to offer and thats where were going to take our  break were going to return back here in a few minutes were going to use the restroom and get  snacks and stuff you guys can rest here for a minute we have a giveaway  travis and marisha fruit  taliesin dont eat the spiky bit  matt thats right make a wisdom saving throw real fast  travis really  marisha wait really  matt yeah  liam everybody

none	 it nine inch nail hammer  matt its two ns ailhammer so nnailhammer congratulations nnailhammer you won the  giveaway denobo will contact you and get you the info congratulations all right so back in to  where we left off  as you ascend the remainder of the stairs and step into the entryway to the fortress of the sun  youre led through a series of gorgeous silver and gold archways dozens of feet above you the  intricacies of the interior scrolling trim and inlay across every wall pillar and bannister is  incredible not gaudy just 
none	 magnificent in purpose and history glancing across the marble floor you  can see the construction here is immaculate there isnt any sort of smudge or damage dealt anywhere  these arches themselves even as you glance over and look the detail seems to fractal smaller and  smaller in places where you cant imagine a craftsmans hand could have built this only  through the will of a god could such a thing come into creation on such a vast and minor scale  you also notice as you walk in theres no shadow or shade the walls seem 
none	 to almost emanate light  on their own  marisha i beg to differ  matt the outsides a different story  marisha go to the courtyard  liam just you wait  laura no shadow underneath us  matt no shadow underneath you looking around you and looking at your hands you can see very  faint shadows can be cast between your fingers and things that are very close but its like theres  a diffused light throughout the entirety of the interior of the fortress that casts away any  darkness or shadow theres no umbra theres 
none	 no place where light is absent it is just light  everywhere  you hear this soft music played the deeper into the fortress you get  marisha clubs over here guys  matt rocks fall everybody dies  laughter  matt its okay  liam benny hill music commences  matt soft music you hear playing throughout the interior of the fortress like this distant sound  of a thousand soft choir voices accompanying the inspirational sight of the building that you now  walk through you see other entities adorned in armor still opaque and pearlescent in their 
none	  spirit form some of them have flowing robes of gold and white that trail behind them and drift  across the floor silently  the further in you walk you begin to see where some of these spires and spiral staircases twist  upward the rooms have purpose in construction but the scale of those that walk through the halls is  so varied that you see staircases on large scales and small scales they almost seem to wrap around  each other in places its surreal almost escheresque in some of the interior  construction  you see 
none	 archways and doorways on different levels some that appear to be reached only by those that  can fly versus those that can just walk and climb occasionally you look up and you can see  skylights across the top some open glass and crystal some appearing to be a small window of  stained glass that glitters down in bright blues purples reds oranges theres definitely a  stained glass motif in a lot of the interior of the fortress which youve seen in some of pelors  imagery and the symbol around him is like a circular stained 
none	 glass structure that spirals in  with the actual star and the sun in the center  the music continues to grow louder and louder the further in you walk and you feel like youre  being led along for a good 15 minutes straight this structure this hallway just goes on and on  the arches passing one after the other after the other your eyes have adjusted to the brightness  of the interior now eventually you come to another set of large doors these doors  themselves no wood no stone just pure vibrant platinum and gold 
tavern	 the symbol upon them seems to  be the same circular motif as the symbol of the dawnfather with the star in the center but the  detail and intricacies you get close and your eyes especially you vex and vax you glance  and you can see on every small scale even just a simple bar of the star and the sun has writing  and has artwork and then as you look closer even on a smaller scale that writing is comprised of  smaller artwork and smaller writing youre thrown off by the level of detail and 
none	 intricacy of this  places construction youre in awe your jaw drops as these reveals seem to barrage you with  each step into the structure  at that point the doors scraping noise open and you wince once again as the light that fills  the room from the inside is nearblinding you close your eyes a bit and all you hear is this  deep resonant voice say come  laura this has to be heaven the doors just keep opening  marisha this must be the bright light that everyone sees when they die  travis dont 
none	 steal his doors or anything  sam you want to steal the doors  travis what a terrible thing to say in the presence of the dawnfather  liam muffled all right one foot in front of the other here we go  sam oh we cant hear liam  liam one foot in front of the other here we go i said  taliesin lets go  matt you shield your eyes upon stepping into the actual chamber because otherwise even closing  your eyes isnt enough the light is so intense it still hurts through your eyelids as 
none	 you step  inside and look off you can now glance around the interior of this chamber the same level of  fractallike scrolling detail you saw in the doors lines every inch of the wall on the inside of this  large square chamber hundreds of feet across on each side its incredible the floor is almost  mirrored in its polish glancing down while there is no immediate shadow behind you the bright  light does cast a bit behind you you can see your reflection almost perfectly in the polished floor  below  you glance up 
none	 and you see the interior of that giant steeplelike tower thats sat at the center  of the fortress in the distance and you look up almost endlessly you can see floor after floor  with an endless spiral of various stained glass structures and reliefs and small statues that  protrude from the edges and this tower is seemingly hollow just leading up and you cant  even make out the top of it from this distance it looks like a tower that is infinite almost from  this perspective its so big  laura is the light coming 
none	 from the tower  matt no the lights coming from the center of the room as your eyes slowly adjust and you  glance past your fingers and your hands you see there in the center of the chamber is a 25foot  throne of gold brass silver and ruby sitting upon that throne sits a mighty being wearing the  most intricate and beautiful golden plate armor youve ever seen similar in detail and design as  the interior of the chamber around you it almost blends in if you didnt see it shift a white  cloak encases 
none	 the shoulders of this entity and sways gently at their side like its been brushed  off and dangles over one of the arm rests and where a head would be instead there is a burning  star so bright that you can only look but a second before you have to avert your gaze and shut  your lids out of the pain just enough time to barely make out the outline of what appears to be  a male head almost featureless burning within the corona this you can only imagine is the  dawnfather himself pelor  
none	 as you step into the chamber the door boom closes behind you and the winged planar entities  that pushed you in are not in the chamber its just you and the dawnfather  sam look how far weve come guys  laughter  sam from throwing shit at people  laura didnt you do that just last week  sam i did i do that most weeks  laura grog  travis yes  laura next time we visit the dawnfather wear some underwear this floor is like a mirror  travis but i dont ever oh okay  
none	 taliesin what are you oh god  sam ooh you mean i can oh sorry  laughter  matt vox machina  travis oh shit  laughter  travis little bit of pee comes out a little bit  marisha you guys he knows our name  matt you come with purpose i can sense your determination what would you tell me of your  purpose  taliesin vecna walks the earth  marisha we are here to prevent the coming of a third calamity  travis we seek the means to destroy him and all he stands for  
none	 marisha he seeks ascension into godhood  liam and all your children are in danger and we have begun communing with the gods i extend  slowly the wings and bow my head in deference to him  taliesin the divergence is threatened your guards your creatures have some of our proof in  their care at the moment  matt another seeks the path of the matron of ravens a flaw in our annihilation of her hubris  that it still exists is dire news that it exists in the hands of such a slippery vile mortal as  
none	 vecna even more so i thank you for your haste in sharing your findings i shall ponder a strategy  he leans back in his chair brushes his hand like this and the doors behind you boom open  laura it was you that i was speaking to in whitestone i had no idea  we have the eye of vecna  matt his form shifts a bit seems to lean forward on the throne resting the bright burning  starlike head on the edge of his gauntleted fist leaning forward in your direction you try and  glance up 
none	 but it hurts in the presence present the artifact  sam well we gave it to  laura no we still have it  sam oh we do  laura yeah he kept it with us  ashley oh i have it actually  sam could you guys turn them up we cant hear them at all  laura please  matt so as you place the box on the ground  ashley ill try to take it over im going to leave it on the ground its a little hot over  there  matt okay as you leave 
none	 it on the ground you cant see his eyes you cant see where hes  facing necessarily but you can sense his attention its like a beacon across the room  its everpresent but there is definitely a focal point that you can sense when it comes to you  its like having a spotlight on you amongst a theater of thousands of people its intimidating  but also exhilarating the beacon shifts in the direction of the small box you placed on the  ground immediately the box flips open and you watch as the eye levitates out on 
none	 its own  twitching and looking around in all directions it has no lid to close and the tiny slitlike iris  of it seems to retract best it can in the presence of such bright light you hear this low  ruminating hums do you have purpose with this  sam only if it can help us destroy vecna  matt do you know how this would help you destroy vecna  marisha we dont know how to destroy vecna  taliesin we seek knowledge and power  marisha and assistance  matt i could destroy this right now 
none	 only if you do not need it its existence is a threat but the  choice is yours since you brought it before me  laura do you know what help it would be to us on the material plane  matt he stares through you the beacon finds you  marisha its not the only one in existence there are others  taliesin i think it might be yes  marisha right  liam thats his eye  matt there are other people missing eyes but this is the only one  liam its his and it should be 
none	 destroyed  sam right now  laura maybe itll make him weaker if it is destroyed he obviously put it in his scion we  destroy it we keep someone else like delilah briarwood from coming into power right  taliesin yes i think  laura i say destroy it  liam delilah was obviously his pawn and she was using it fuck it destroy it  taliesin we stand with a master of the grey hunt she is the one who can speak for whitestone  on that level if you say destroy it we destroy it  matt 
none	 the beacon comes back to you again the stage beneath you everyone around you seems to  vanish in the light thats the attention of this entity this god ancient beyond all thought and  reason that you would contemplate awaiting your answer  laura you know so much more than we do if you believe it is unsafe then we trust your wisdom in  destroying it  matt the wisdom of the creators is to instill their creations with the choice of their own  destiny  laura then i say destroy it  marisha what if we 
none	 can  matt the choice is made and with that point you watch as without leaving attention from you  the eye begins to lift up out of the box once more the hand that was under the chin unfurls  into a clasping set of fingers and as they clench together you hear the metal clink and grind and  you watch as this light begins to flare around the eye and if you could hear a squeaking scream from  a powerful artifact you watch as it just burns in a flash and shattering noise the shattering  
dung	 sound echoes throughout the room you see a burst of greenish dark energy and for a moment the  light in the room seems to dim like a very faint almost brownout  travis quietly shit  liam good  laura i think thats a good thing  ashley i do too  liam it is a good thing  laura yes  liam vecnas a puppeteer he used that to move delilah its gone  matt now if you have no further business  laura we seek out the goddess ioun the goddess of knowledge the ritual of seeding 
none	 was lost to  time and we know that the goddess ioun is one of the only keepers of that knowledge  matt theres a moment of contemplation on his end she is safe she recovers hidden away i  know elements of where she resides but this information only belongs to those trusted  marisha we know you and her helped seal away the chaos of these secrets before we may need your  help doing it again  matt he leans forward towards you and you feel the beacon of attention shift towards you this  time and 
none	 you keyleth who have spent most of your life trying to dodge and dive from the  attention of the masses trying to buck the destiny that has been thrust upon you since  childhood here in this moment you have the attention of one of the prime creator gods of  exandria and you feel yourself weaken and strengthen at the same time youre not sure  whether to run or stand and the voice comes out once more i have champions across all of  exandria who have lived longer and proven themselves worthy capable my consecrations are 
none	  taxing and i will not have it wasted on those set to fail  laura how can we prove ourselves to you  matt you have not one faithful among you yet you beseech my blessing  marisha i could be your champion you could teach me to believe i arguably am faithless i know  you all know that i believe and i have respect and i am aweinspired by all of this but faith i  still dont know if i have but i i believe you could teach me  matt is there anyone else who 
none	 would challenge this proclamation  laura i dont want to challenge you keyleth  marisha what we already have one champion of the raven queen why not  taliesin once you blessed whitestone  matt whitestone is under my watch and keep it was created through the battlefield in which i  sealed tharizdun himself it was the grounds in which ioun was wounded in the calamity there was  much sorrow in those lands yes it is under my watch  marisha im friends with the sun tree we talk occasionally  matt a faithless stands to try and 
none	 accept the champions mantle i ask once more is there any  to challenge this claim  laura keyleth let me ive never felt this before  marisha you are the lady of whitestone it suits you  matt very well you step forth with the growing bud of faith that befits the growth of a  champion i will see you show me your quality you as the vessel kneel before me  laura i kneel  matt he leans forward at the edge of the throne you hear the metal clinking as the plates shift  and move 
none	 and you can hear now at the proximity as he leans down towards you the faint flicker of  the surface of the sunlike head that is the beacon of the dawnfathers face you would accept  my trial brave soul then you and your allies must ascend the tower of the zenith the chosen  among you lady vexahlia you must reach the top of the tower before this time runs thin as he  lifts his hand you watch as apparating in the air a container of glass with sand across the  top he lifts his other 
none	 hand another one appears and these two hourglasses now held aloft gliding  slowly above the space where you stand ascend to the zenith embrace your faith and throw yourself  in the fires of dawn should you be strong of heart and your faith be true the flames will  grant you my blessing  laura just me or the group of us  matt you must jump into the flames they can help you ascend however your trial begins now  and you watch as one of the glasses suddenly shifts and three of the winged planars appear 
none	 in  the room armored around you arms crossed and they look to be trying to block the passage into  the tower as they fly up you look up to the seemingly endless beacon above you to the top of  the tower that you cannot see at this distance and you know immediately somehow quickly you  have to get there so what are you doing  travis oh god  marisha i hate timed challenges  laura well ive got the boots but i okay im going i take off  sam wait  liam click your 
none	 boots of haste  sam im going to to turn her into a red dragon  travis do you want that  laura sure i click my boots of haste before he does it  matt okay so you click your boots of haste they come into you you feel the surge of energy the  rush the burst of adrenaline through your body as you begin casting  sam true polymorph  laura oh my god does that ever end do you have to cancel it  sam yes  matt all right so as you begin to ascend 
none	 you watch as the three planar begin to rush towards  you their arms out to grasp anyone else going to do anything  travis yeah i would like to smash my gauntlets together and cast enlarge  matt all right so you go into your larger form now  travis and rage ill charge one of them  matt theyre up in the air shes flying up  taliesin youve got the carpet  travis and i pull the carpet out  matt okay  taliesin i click my boots of spider climbing and spend an action surge to 
none	 draw and start taking  shots at the wings i want to drop them out of the air  matt okay go for it make three shots very quickly as youre ascending on the broom as  quickly as possible and they begin to converge on you you feel this tickle of energy in the back of  your mind and you watch as your hands begin to suddenly grow claws and scales a red color  travis vax do something  liam i cast shield of faith on my own ass  matt okay shield of faith cast on 
none	 vax  laura can everybody fly  taliesin im running up the wall  laura before i polymorph i toss you my broom  sam are you going to allow that  matt sure so you throw the broom off the side and you begin to plummet immediately through the  air as youre concentrating on the spell to cast it you finish it off and you plummet back about  half the distance and then whoosh these giant leathery red dragon wings whip out of your form  and you catch yourself the broom clatters to the ground and 
none	 scanlan marches over and grabs it  manages to get it under his grasp  laura you know that word  matt all righty so you begin to ascend upward right as they begin to descend on your dragon  form  taliesin 20 24 and 36  matt 20 24 and 36 they all hit  taliesin thats a strength saving throw or they fall a little bit  matt strength saving throw all right that is an 18  taliesin nope they fall  matt 21  taliesin thats okay  matt and a 12 so two of 
none	 them you shoot two of the wings out of the way and they plummet down  and you manage to coast past two of them in your dragon form one of them does manage to grab onto  you and get its hands big strong hands on the back of your head and try and steer you to the  side  laura can i cast frightful presence  matt well get to that in just a moment its going to attempt to no it tries to pull against  you but even with its extremely strong planar strength it 
none	 cannot guide you away from the path  and you push past you are now outside of the chamber in the base of the tower just flying  upward you can go ahead and use your frightful presence all right so thats your action  laura all of the creatures no of my choosing so all the bad not bad guys but you know  people were fighting  matt as you roar loudly and it echoes filling the entirety of the chamber the music of the  surroundings now merging and shifting with this horrible dragon roar none of 
none	 these angelic  entities seem even remotely affected by it  laura oh really they dont even have to make a wisdom saving throw  matt they are immune to fear or being frightened sorry  laura that makes sense  matt but do you continue flying upward okay so you finish your spell you take your shots  keyleth pike anything  ashley am i close enough to grog to hop onto the carpet as well  matt okay so pike and grog get onto the carpet keyleth what are you doing  marisha are people clustered up together 
none	 by now  laura do i take the alignment of the animal that im polymorphed into  matt not the alignment just your mental scores  marisha are people super clustered or is she now clustered with them  matt no shes above everybody shes way past all you guys she shot straight up  marisha so the angel dudes are all clustered together  matt two of them fell a little bit one of thems on her back shes making her way up guys the  first stained glass is starting to run out  marisha throw up a 
none	 big level five flaming sphere ah wait can i do a with my spear can i do a  higherlevel fireball and just do more charges out of it or no  matt ill say no because you cant spend more charges to increase the level of the spell  marisha then i will do a 5thlevel flaming sphere  matt okay so the flaming sphere slams upward against the side there saving throw rolls a one  on saving throw so it takes damage flaming spear hits it however  marisha it doesnt hit both of them  matt 
none	 no you can slam it into one creature per turn the one thats on her back you mean whats  the range on the flaming sphere  laura come on the time is running out  matt no time for a book never mind it doesnt matter the flaming sphere slams into one of the  ones thats not on her back its too far out of your range  all right so whos doing what  next  travis were rocketing up on the rug  matt okay the rug not very fast and her speed is much faster as 
none	 a dragon so you guys are coming  up behind and youre just watching the dragon flapping  travis are we close to any of the other two that are at the bottom  matt no but as soon as that timer went out the chambers roof above you slams shut youre all  cut off from vex  taliesin i was running up the wall i didnt make it in time  matt not at your speed no its a big chamber  laura okay im going to haste as fast as i can when i clicked my boots 
none	 do i still get a hasted  action  matt yes you do  laura okay cool then i can go 160 feet  matt yes you can the planar is still holding on to the back of your head its going to make  another strength check  laura im going to try to tail whip him is that a thing i can do  matt make an athletics check  laura okay oh i have a red dice its so perfect and i never choose this one  matt what did you roll  laura oh okay well 
none	 what am i adding to it  matt add your strength modifier if there isnt an athletics score then whatever your strength  modifier is  laura that would be plus five  sam are you talking about hers or the dragons  laura oh a plus seven so 13  matt 13 the planar grabs one side of your horn and causes you to slam into the side of the tower  and you skid across and smash into one of the stained glass windows which smash fires out the  side and you end up slowing down a 
none	 bit and it actually takes you a moment it halves your speed  for this round you try and get your wings back up are you going to do anything about the guy on  your back or are you going to keep plugging as fast as you can upwards  laura hes on my back or hes like hanging onto me  matt hes on your neck and head hes holding on and trying to steer you off to the side by  controlling your movement  laura im going to spin and try to slam into the wall 
none	 and knock him into the stone  sam can she do like a wing thing  laura yeah im going to use my wings to thrust me faster into the wall  matt okay go ahead and make an athletics check  laura no no okay athletics check was a plus seven so 19  matt 19 17 so you slam into the wall and you hear groans behind you the stained glass that  shattered reforms right where you left it and you continue to ascend upwards still holding onto  you but its now disadvantaged on its next 
none	 roll because you slammed it into the wall so  flapping making your ascent upward as fast as you can you watch as the tower slowly pincers  closer and closer you watch as another layer begins to close above all right hes going to  attempt to try and slam you into the wall again go ahead and make another athletics check roll a  d20 and add your strength modifier go for it  laura okay that one didnt count  matt you didnt intend to roll it  laura okay ooh okay 21  matt yeah you 
none	 beat him he tries to pull you off to the side and you begin to skid into it your  wing hits the side of the tower scraping noise but you keep pushing forward the pain hits you  you end up taking about 25 points of damage just grinding into this divine golden side but you keep  flying up flapping the tower gets tighter and tighter and tighter you now can see as the planar  is going to attempt to  laura wait can i  matt what are you going to do  laura is he 
none	 hanging onto me with one arm now what is he doing because i knocked him into the  wall right  matt yeah what are you doing  laura im going to just dash im going to fuck him and just dash  matt youre going to go double speed all right  laura double speed  matt you shoot up that gives him a full round to go ahead and try and scare you off roll again with  your strength  laura 15  matt crash slams you into the wall you skid and slow down a little 
none	 bit you can see its  closing but you are dashing so you get a second speed run which does get you up towards where the  walls closing now you can see now the bright light is getting brighter and brighter your eyes  are hurting in its presence you can see a large brazier at the top of the tower that is now  in flames before you youre not quite there you have one more round hes going to go ahead and  now turn around and now the angel turns around on your face he is 
none	 going to attempt to punch in your  eyes  sam do you have legendary  laura im going to use my legendary resistance  matt well its a physical attack on you whats your ac  laura 19 natural  matt yeah it hits you you take disadvantage on your next strike go ahead and roll an athletics  check to try and buck him off one last time this is the only one you have time for disadvantage  because he punched you in the face  laura okay 14  matt 14 all right youre slowing down 
none	 youre slowing down youre not quite getting there hes  bashing you in the face  laura im going to take my claws up and rake him  matt okay make another strength check  laura what is it 18  matt 11 you thrust him off your face as he falls off down below flapping you make it up to  the top and you now see the brazier is about the size of your dragon form its physically your  size and you can see now the towers beginning to close around you what are you going to 
none	 do  laura im going to reach the tower thing and push myself up through  matt okay you pull your way up to the top and now youre right above the brazier and the flames  you look down into the brazier the fire there burning is everpresent light  laura i rush into the fire  matt you dive into the fire your dragon form which resists it at that point it immerses your  entire form at which point you hear the tower guys above you crack and you hear this echoing  smash sound of what 
none	 sounds like shattering of a thousand windows at once you as you dive into  the flames feel this moment of searing bright pain in your eyes in your mind your dragon form  is immune to flames but your form suddenly shrinks the spell dispelled the dragonoid form  cast away you sense this kind of lost nothing your whole body is numb at this point and you are just  surrounded by a white light much like where vax in the plane in his communion with the raven  queen is shrouded in darkness this is endless every 
none	 color you have no sense of personal form  you have no sense of time place and for the first time in a long time you dont remember your  name for a brief instant you think what bit of conscious thought you can make is this is what  oblivion feels like did you make the right choice were you led astray were you strong of  heart enough the flames were intended to cleanse away sin darkness possibly those who are  unworthy is this it now did you fail  you guys down below watch as the 
none	 chamber doors that closed off above you scraping noise open up  again to reveal the tower and you can see there suspended in the middle of the air thousands of  shards of stained glass that had shattered inwards from the impact but frozen held in place as they  all slowly retract back reforming the windows that were once there whatever impact or shock  wave had scattered them below reversed and repaired and you watch as they do so ascending  until the towers back untouched as it was the one planar that had ridden the dragon 
none	 form of vex  towards the top of the tower slowly descends flapping and lands next to the three others and  they all give a nod towards the dawnfather whos still there not looking upward just looking at the  rest of the remaining members of vox machina his beacon of attention just shifting from one to the  other the three planars leave the stillopen doors what does she mean to you  sam to us oh god  matt to you all of you  marisha i told you that i was faithless which might be true 
none	 when it comes to the gods but not  with vexahlia not with vox machina she gives me my power  sam her name is vex and she is greedy and mean sometimes and she can steal a lot shes a little  bit not the greatest person but her flaws highlight everything that is right about her  which is she does all these things to protect her friends and her family she would give her life  for any of us and for anyone who was truly in need and shes not perfect but shes the most  
none	 perfect of all of us  travis she believes in me she tries to teach me to use my brain which i dont do very often she  tries to teach me to learn from the world and she always cheers me on which not a lot of people do  i believe in her  matt the beacon shifts to you pike  pike i dont have a real sister but i consider her more of my sister than ive ever had shes  family and if you take her from me there will be hell to pay  
none	 matt the beacon shifts to percival  percy she is mistress of the grey hunt of whitestone baroness of the first house of  whitestone she is my heart and my judgment and the future that i have chosen and she is the one  that i have betrothed to  sam what betrothed  matt the beacon shifts back to vax  liam she is every hope i have when i am gone she will make the world right she has the  intelligence and the savviness and the heart to make realworld decisions she is me but better 
none	  she is your champion  matt then there is hope and you watch as in the center of the chamber a second star seems to be  birthed before you this bright point of light that begins to swell in equal intensity as the head of the  dawnfather himself as a flash consumes the chamber and there before you you see now  reborn hair scattered back intact slowly descending eyes closed consciousness not yet  drawn from within vexahlia as her feet touch the ground and she falls to her knees she  breathes in  your 
none	 eyes open you look around and see the faces of your friends your family and youre  immediately aware of the presence of the entity behind you as you spin and look whereas there once  was a burning star and to the rest of you you see the painful endless light that averts your  gaze it doesnt hurt your eyes as much and you can see the faint features the soft cheeks the  hairless head and the bright warm eyes of he who brings the dawn and you can see the smile there  behind the light 
none	 there is hope  get your blessing of the dawnfather  gasping and cheering  travis holy shit super saiyan  laura what did i get what is it  matt you naturally have resistance to necrotic damage  laura thats good for me that fucking finger of death  matt and if you want to read the rest of that you can  laura as a bonus action you channel the light of day into your being for one hour you admit  emit fuck me running you emit bright light in a 120foot radius and any evil creature 
none	 within that  120foot radius that hits you with an attack or spell immediately suffers 4d6 radiant damage and  is knocked prone  marisha wow youre a walking nuke  liam shine bright like a diamond  laura laughs once this blessing ability is used it cant be used again for seven days  ashley yeah  laura holy moly  ashley blessings of the gods  taliesin well have to add a sixth star to the de rolo crest fucking excited  laura thank you thank you for allowing me to represent you  matt if what you 
none	 say is true then we are too late to prevent his ascension know that killing a  god is beyond even most deities to destroy is to diminish one low enough to seal them away for  eternity as i have done once before such a technique i used to banish the chained oblivion  once after it nearly slew the knowing mistress having brought it low in battle ioun had devised  something she called the prime trammel  sam the prime trammel  matt guided by a sizable sliver of a gods power one such device could be 
none	 formed and when  enough are affixed to a wounded god seal them away in a plane beyond the astral sea such a  method could perhaps force a new god back through the divine gate and beyond the reach of your  world ioun however the one who has the design for such an artifact she has been in hiding  since her wounding she heals still the wounded god and has feared for the past eight centuries  that her enemies seek to finish the job we communicate on occasion through missives and  emissaries all that i 
none	 know is the key to her hidden realm is within someone the last word from  the mistress from nearly a century before granted me this the gauntleted hand extends and opens  and there you see apparating in the space above what appears to be a threedimensional  topographical map of some kind it slowly rotates made of pure sunlight and flame its a mountain  range with a glowing light within a small hidden house or hovel within a forest make an  investigation check i would say keyleth vexahlia vaxildan and scanlan  sam natural 20  
dung	 laura oh good thank god because mine sucked  marisha also a natural 20  sam its a real good map  matt yeah what did you get vax  liam not a natural 20  matt okay glancing at it both of you recognize as it pulls back and shifts inward this is deep  within the cliffkeep this is far north of kraghammer this is in a forested region outside  the pools of wittebak  marisha pools of wittebak  matt wittebak once a gnomish home it befell to a terrible natural occurrence sparked by unnatural  
none	 means and since has become a series of acidic and toxic natural liquids and waters that burble up  from beneath the earth and many wandering giants and larger ogrish folk use to their hearts  content but its not in the pools of wittebak just near it this strange hovel the voice of the  dawnfather burns forth once more the heavy resonance shaking the room if you seek to devise  these prime trammels then take this stone my champion it should be enough essence for one of  them you watch as he reaches up into the 
none	 halo the corona of light around the head and plucks  from behind an ear a small bead of extremely bright light as he pulls it from his head you  watch the strength and intensity of his glow ever so faintly diminish and places it in your hand  as soon as it releases from the gauntleted fingers so massive each finger is as thick as  your torso it plops into your palm and the glow fades and there before you you see what looks to  be some sort of an ovallike opal  laura i love 
none	 opals  matt now i have invested what i can safely do within you go be swift find this key strike  soon destroy or seal this great evil and prove my faith in you is not misplaced vexahlia  laura it wont be  matt the doors behind you that are already partially ajar rumble open up all the way  laura i guess ill put this in a really safe pocket then theres one thats got an extra  snap triple snap and then a zipper over it  marisha just dont let it fall in the toilet 
none	 when you go over to flush  travis i take out the little pebble and i drop it on the floor  matt you reach for the pebble its not there  travis shit is there a hole in it no  matt no hole sarenrae was not going to teleport you across the realm letting you take away one of  the prized souls of her people  travis oh those were the souls  liam that was the pope travis that was the pope  travis shouldve swallowed the rock  matt as you exit the chamber you 
none	 can see the various souls and planar that wander the halls on  their own business have all now joined shoulder to shoulder as a procession showing you a respectful  exit from the compound as you walk they all seem to give a nod of respect towards vexahlia the  now freshly chosen champion of pelor for this endeavor as you step beyond the staircase that  leads you down beyond the fortress of the sun into the center of the clearing that is watched  and protected by the various trees of the dawnfather looking out amongst the 
none	 endless  progression of the orchards you consider what your next path is to discover who and what this  key is to ioun and hopefully theres enough time because time right now and the decisions you make  will greatly affect what can and cannot be done  and thats where were going to end tonights session  travis oh my god what the fuck  marisha champions over here  laura oh shit  sam singing we are the champions  matt this is so fun i havent been able to do epiclevel content thats so fun
