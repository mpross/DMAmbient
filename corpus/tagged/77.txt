all the rest of the announcements we have  marisha im so /none/ emotional  matt so lets bring it in to tonights episode of critical role  groovy critical role theme  matt and welcome back  taliesin that was a good one  matt that was great so last we left off the mighty nein in making their way northward towards  their eventual goal of shadycreek run to complete their second mission that they accepted from the  gentleman in zadash have been traversing the countryside and made their way to the city of  hupperdook the largely gnomish cultural city there of industry and currently construction of  war /tavern/ machines to send towards the conflict with xhorhas to the east there you saw the very hardy  work atmosphere of the gnomes and then the evening very crazy party atmosphere in which many  of you dove into a hard drinking contest you won the title of the blushing tankard tavern beating  out their old champions and woke up with terrible hangovers and realizing that most of your gold  had been stolen upon doing some sleuthing around the town you had bullied a couple of bullies that  were pushing rissa around they had been a problem /none/ for a while sent them peeing their pants and  rushing you spoke with rissas father in his tinkering inventors store in which you  discovered a shiny object a fantastic experimental hand crossbow construct of his that  he would be interested in relinquishing without payment if you do him the favor of correcting a  mistake he made a while back apparently he crafted on the request of the starosta of the  city a powerful gearkeeper a constructlike entity that was meant to help be a warden within  the prison that went crazy killed a bunch /none/ of people and they sealed it off and its been there  forgotten ever since you said youd take a look at this eventually you discovered that the money  you had lost had been taken by four children who currently are without parents who have been  living on the streets here in the city of hupperdook while their folks had been sent to the  prison six months before for being caught worshiping unapproved deities within the empire  you after having this conversation with them retrieving your money and leaving kiri with them  for the time /none/ being for safekeeping decided to see if you had the possibility to prevent them from  being sent to an empirerun orphanage in the hopes of freeing their parents in some way shape  or form from their binds that was where we had left off  marisha where are we now are we still in the butcher  matt you guys have stepped out of the butcher home leaving the kids behind with kiri and you  are now out in the open streets of hupperdook late morning midday what would you like to do  marisha is rissa /none/ still there  matt rissa is still with you  marisha rissa sorry okay  sam you said late morning midday so we could at least go check out this prison and do some  scouting before nightfall yeah  marisha we were talking about planning and then sleeping and then going  taliesin if we see those teenagers also we should probably call them off  sam oh the teenagers  marisha i really would hate for our problem with them to end up coming and finding the kids my  words arent really here right now you know /town/ what i mean  sam yeah you just had a baby i understand  marisha emotionally  liam do we want to leave it up to chance that well run into those two kids that they will not  succeed or well find them  taliesin at the very least we can leave word with their employer and if we run into them well  call them off  marisha i say we send rissa to go talk to them  sam rissa knows the town though she might be able to help us scout out this prison  marisha /none/ thats true maybe we go back to their employer  taliesin well have rissa meet us at the prison maybe later she can call them off and we can head  to the prison  sam why dont we have fjord and jester go tell their employers  taliesin as fjord yeah that sounds great as taliesin never mind as fjord yep well  great yep  sam which one are you are you jester  taliesin i dont know anymore who wants the node by the way  sam oh yes well lets find out if we need it /none/ yet  marisha yeah lets hold on to it maybe theres going to be some sort of emergency situation  taliesin fair  marisha use node in case of emergency  liam jester could we perhaps hold on to your backpack before you go so that we have that in  case we need it  matt no i am going to hold onto this why would i give it to you  liam well i feel it is fairly obvious but okay as you were  matt im not going anywhere why would i give it to you this /none/ is my bag i paid for it  liam ja okay so what are we doing now  sam i guess were all going  marisha this is revenge for any time we havent let matt go on an npc just saying  taliesin lets go take a look at this prison  sam all right  matt rissa goes all right i can go ahead and lead you to it cant say ive been too close to  it personally so far follow me rissa guides you through the rest of the shelf back to the  walkway that /none/ winds down the front of the mountain to the bottom half of the city of hupperdook  sam lowerdook  matt lowerdook if you will  marisha wait are fjord and jester going to go call off the employers  matt theyre with you guys you can go head that way if you want to call them off unless you want  to send them on their own wild goose chase  sam fuck those guys theyll be fine  marisha i would just hate for them to find the kids and then do something to the kids  sam /none/ how would they find the kids  taliesin theyre literally on a mission to find the kids right now  sam hmm  marisha i mean we put calebs alarm across it but still  sam we did  ashley still if they get across  marisha exactly i dont know  matt i could maybe send them a message  sam oh yes you have that spell dont you  matt i do  marisha can you do it to the kids  sam to fitz and ashton  marisha yeah  taliesin and marisha lets do that  /none/ sam to fitz  matt okay  marisha man that solves that problem  matt she quietly tugs on the symbol of the traveler and goes like okay fitz this is the  girl with the people that were making you angry  sam you have like eight words left  matt we found it so  marisha we dont need help  matt everything is good  sam go back to work  matt i think thats all of it gobacktowork  taliesin technically go back to work can be one word if you say it fast enough  /none/ sam thats true a lot of that was hyphenated  matt the traveler is very forgiving  taliesin grammar  matt rissa leads you down this path to the iron lot which is youre guided to the basement  youve seen it as you approached and there was the large platform elevator that rose up to the second  layer its currently not being used its locked on the upper floor as you head into that area  the smokestacks are billowing strongly business is in the process of being done fullthrottle in  the understanding that this coming conflict /none/ or the now arrived conflict on the eastern side has put  everyone into overdrive to prepare whatever sort of equipment or weaponry they can send that  direction  sam and the stuff theyre making is catapults or guns  matt well from the outside all you can see because you havent been inside any of the  warehouses there is the iron lot and theres the assembly yard the assembly yard is the one thats  the open space where theyre building these large siege engines you see mobile carts that are  either horsedrawn or powered by /none/ something you dont quite understand yet that have other large  weapons attached to them  marisha we saw boltthrowers those giant boltthrowers like lord of the ringsstyle  siege towers also lord of the ringsstyle  taliesin very lord of the rings  marisha battering ram like every fantasy moviestyle but definitely lord of the rings and  the huge cannons  taliesin not very lord of the rings  marisha pirates  sam cool  marisha thats what we saw last or thats what i think i saw when we did a perception check or  something  /none/ matt mmhmm  taliesin and it looks like a big factory that looks like a evil willy wonka factory kind of thing  marisha uhhuh  matt yes so as you are being led down rissas pointing out some elements of it she goes okay  so over that side is the omnismelter she points over to a cluster of a dozen or so warehouses that  are scattered in a spider weblike formation that are connected by a series of hallways between each  other and then towards a central piece she goes that there is where most of /none/ the foundries of the  city lie where all the various mined ingots or those imported are melted down and utilized the  foreman there is a bit of a tool theres the armavault she points to the far northern side of  the mountain base and you see a 25 30foot tall by 60foot across iron door that is solid and  jammed into the side of this mountain it looks like its very well protected from this glance at  the distance from what you can see theres maybe two dozen or so crownsguard that are stationed at /none/  its base thats where most of the funds that are saved for the uses of the city maintain as well as  a number of the not currently being used devices of war means of defending the city should it come  under attack if you will points over there you can see what looks to be where most of this smoke  and steam is rising from there is this one large twostory black tower that has a single column of  fast moving smoke pouring out of it you can see areas where the smoke seems to /town/ be pulsing or  darkening and widening at certain places she goes that there is the underbellows thats  where they utilize a number of the forges and furnaces for the factories here theyve harnessed  some of the volcanic activity beneath the mountain and that maintains a consistent heat for the  forges smells downright awful to be honest over theres the firemark facility she points over to  a building that looks a little simpler its not super tall and ominouslooking its very plain  made of cheap metals you notice all the buildings here are mostly metal /none/ probably because theres a  lot of dealing with heat fire sparks and the last thing you need is any of these things to  catch fire she points though to the firemark facility and she goes this is where theyre  developing a majority of certain explosive and black powderbased technologies  sam whats that place called again  matt its called the firemark facility  marisha firemark  sam is it heavily protected  matt chuckles most everything is here then right over there and she points to the southern  side of the mountain base of the /none/ iron lot to a smaller doorway similar in shape and construction  as to the armavault but its a little more localized maybe about 15foot high and about  20foot wide that is the gearhold prison the one you were asking about the one where my father  done fucked up  taliesin what do you know about that machine he built anyway  matt its have you ever seen an automaton where theyre made of stone or made of clay  taliesin come across a couple  matt imagine one thats made of metal and gears and blades lots /none/ of blades  marisha what blades  matt blades  marisha oh god  taliesin vampire hunters sorry  matt it is covered in daywalkers yes  marisha do the blades spin  matt they do the whole thing spins actually it doesnt have feet  sam it just rolls and cuts  matt basically  marisha oh my god  liam it is animated by magical means  matt partially magical and partially clockwork  taliesin is it steampowered or is it  matt the power source is magical but most of its actual locomotion is done through clockwork /none/  and various internal gears its actually quite a marvel to behold its just  taliesin its a magical power source then  matt as far as i know its not my mastery its my daft fathers  marisha so wheres the source  sam its inside of it i would assume right  marisha so if we get the source  taliesin maybe  sam what did your father call this robit  matt he referred to it as the gearkeeper  sam the gearkeeper  matt it was designed to be one of the threatening wardens to help /none/ quell any sort of  breakouts of the prison meant as an intimidation device for those who attempted to rise up against  their captors and possibly be its first initial run to be a defensive sentinel for the city if  these things worked properly having five or six of them just rapidly on the outskirts of the city  would probably keep anyone from trying to break in here or make any sort of lawless act in its  boundaries unfortunately theyve only made one and it went crazy and killed a bunch of people so  theres /none/ that  marisha yeah doesnt sound like a city id want to live in  matt yeah thats why im trying to fix it  marisha sighs  taliesin they just let it theyve cornered it into a  matt they sealed it off theyve been trying to get back to it but theres a lot of distraction  and honestly its out of sight out of mind i think  taliesin honestly we could just show up and say weve been hired to try and take care of it and go in  sam would anyone believe that  /none/ taliesin we technically have been hired to go in and take care of it were just working in trade  sam not by the city  taliesin no they know not by the city so by a private contractor  liam i am sorry i dont understand you say theyre too busy to deal with it have they got it  locked away in a vault while it just stomps around  matt as far as i know yeah theyd originally had it placed in the bottom floor in one section  which had more of the very violent criminals /none/ and killed a bunch of them not too bad killed a  bunch of guards thats pretty bad at the time they didnt have the manpower to fight it off so  they sealed the doors and havent had a problem since  ashley so was anyone else left in there with it that it maybe didnt kill or  matt its been there for quite some time a couple years at least i think two or three  years so if anyone was theyve expired im pretty sure sorry  ashley thats fine by me  sam hmm  /none/ taliesin i think were going to have to do a little more research but im feeling pretty good  about our prospects  sam well the main concern is getting in the prison i dont know if walking up to the front  door and saying hi were here to take care of your spinny death problem is going to work  taliesin we heard you have a bug problem were here to take care of it  sam do we need outfits or something  taliesin i mean i suggest we wear shoes and pants but you know  /none/ sam what like orkin man outfits or do we need to look like were official  ashley like a uniform of some sort  taliesin we could have a letter from your father perhaps  marisha can we go get suits  matt thats true  sam but they dont like her father  taliesin yeah but theyd be perfectly happy if we were going in knowing full well what were  getting into theres no harm no foul there  marisha awesome black suits  liam yeah they certainly have nothing to lose we are a group of people /none/ claiming were here to  deal with their issue we either die doing it or solve the problem  sam heisttype maintenance workers uniforms  taliesin okay you really want to break into a prison  sam i just want to wear a onesie  marisha yeah yeah  taliesin i feel like we can make that dream come true  marisha something with a big lapel maybe double breasted sounds great we would look so handsome  you guys  matt jester leans in to rissa and goes rissa do you have any examples of your fathers writing  /none/ because i can copy it pretty well  sam ooh that sounds like something thats way too smart for laura to say  marisha oh  taliesin youre so lucky shes not watching right now  matt shell be watching  ashley she probably is  taliesin shes probably watching hi laura i would love to see if theres any  sort of sketch or blueprint of this thing that we could just take a look at first and maybe have a  thought of our plan of attack  matt i can guarantee you theyre not going to have /none/ any publicly available blueprints of a prison  taliesin no i mean of the machine  matt oh  marisha would your dad  matt we can certainly ask  taliesin just to sort of see what were getting into  matt you see that spark in her eye of a good idea and then thinking about having to go back to her  father shes like sighs  taliesin we can go on our own if you like  matt no its fine ill go im used to him its okay come on  marisha does your dad like /none/ pastries does he have a sweet tooth  matt i imagine he does ive seen him eat a few  marisha does he like pies  matt probably  marisha lets pick up your dad a pie on the way home  matt okay  marisha people like pies right  sam i love a pie  taliesin i mean i like pies but im a bad example of so many things  ashley i really like meat pies  marisha meat pies would your dad like a meat pie i just hear people bring pies  matt fjord kind /none/ of leans in and goes thats good jester  marisha thank you  taliesin snickers  marisha beau but thats okay its been a long emotional day  matt has been  marisha hasnt it fjord  matt i have too much in my head right now guys its been a long day  sam why you playing five characters at the same time  matt its fine  taliesin this brings me back to some home games  matt thanks baby willingham  marisha oh man so much its been the longest day  matt its been the longest /town/ day  liam chuckles  marisha we stop and get a meat pie on the way  matt all right easy enough as youre wandering through the street following the scents of food  that are being cooked in advance of the current lunch hour happening you hear a few whistles go  off in the distance and in that moment rissa goes we best be hurrying before the rush hits  and you pick up the pace as you start hearing the different steam whistles go off and you watch a  lot of the buildings begin to just /none/ swarm out with all their workers on their brief lunch break you  manage to stay ahead of most of the wave making their way up to the top shelf of the city  eventually coming to one of the vendors on the outside who is swarmed by about 12 or 13 different  gnomes you wait patiently for about a good 15 20 minutes or so as they prepare and get all their  meat pies ready sweet pies ready sell a few things a couple of their regulars cut in line in  front of you not paying /town/ much attention or caring that youre waiting patiently but there is a  large crowd behind you and you manage to get to the front and the two gnomes that are currently in  the process of divvying this up look to the rest of you and go oh youre a right  interesting team what brings you here you looking for pies we got pies you want pies  sam wed like a hospitable meat pie  matt single  sam oh  matt its not enough to go around i can tell you  ashley well we might /none/ need a couple  marisha one for us one for him two meat pie sorry three meat pies  matt all right turns around and pulls out three gnomesized meat pies which are about that big  ashley oh  marisha can we make that a double  matt six gnomish meat pies  marisha thank you  matt passes them over  sam we have money again dont we  taliesin yes we have our money back  marisha i throw down for the pies  matt okay well say for the total of that its maybe a silver /none/  sam when the whistles blew matthew did we see any guards do a shift change at the prison  matt because you were rushing to get the pies make a perception check with disadvantage at this  distance  marisha mm  sam seven  matt seven you have no idea  marisha that was super smart though  taliesin yeah no thats a good thought  matt you have your meat pies you want to make your way over back to the tinkertop  marisha i pass out meat pies to anyone who wants one but save one /none/  matt all right so you have one ready you guys snack as you walk along interesting point of  noticing as you guys come by you do see a familiar sight for you and for those whove been  in the empire for a bit youre familiar with this as well nott and caleb  sam oh  matt you see a crew its two crownsguard that are flanking one figure you see wearing a black  cloak with gold trim that goes just past the shoulders its almost like a shawl or a um  brain escapes the /none/ term but its like a short cloak  sam okay  matt these are the tithe collectors  sam oh yes  marisha taxman  matt theyre referred to colloquially as reapers behind their back but you see them exiting one  home and moving onto the next door and knocking  marisha are they heading towards the butcher  matt a ways away but theyre present it seems that the time of year has come the  everysixmonth window seems to be coming or has arrived nevertheless you travel with meat pie in  hand eventually making your way /none/ back to tinkertop inventions the door still partially ajar you see  the faint light of the two lanterns in the back as you enter and there in the back you see in the process  of sketching something down your good friend mastermaker cleff tinkertop ah youve returned  certainly good to see you what can i help you with  sam weve brought gift  matt oh thats so kind thank you so much  marisha it was rissas idea  matt rissa for your old pops did you shes like well it was sort of a group /none/ decision hope  you like it dad its cold but tasty anyway he takes it and starts eating it stuffing it in  chunks through his gnomish maw getting bits of the gravy dripping off of the chin  taliesin were going to take a stab at this death machine we were curious if you could  marisha i love that thats what were calling it  taliesin i like the description  marisha spinning death machine  taliesin if theres any information you can give us about the machine just so that were not going  in cold like /none/ if you know if it has any vulnerabilities to anything  matt plenty i built the thing myself dont worry  taliesin if you can sketch it for us so we can get a sense of  matt oh ive already got it dont worry there friend ill be right back turns around and  disappears behind a  sam we could steal the crossbow we dont have to do the mission at all  taliesin please dont tell me that youre going to do that  sam i could just saying  matt you hear some rustling and some /none/ things falling over a couple of banging noises and then  you hear a clattering damn it  sam is that a cymbal crashing  liam being as the mans daughter is standing  here with us perhaps we will pass on that idea  matt yeah i can hear you just so youre aware im right next to you little one  sam shes clever  marisha no she just has hearing  sam no shes a wily one  matt a moment later cleff returns clutching an armful of rolled pieces of paper and prints and  parchment /none/ and goes heres about everything ive got on the thing throws it down in front of you  some of it unrolls theres various stages of design the breakdown of the mechanics and the  interior of this its extremely intricate and very impressive clockwork roll an intelligence check  taliesin okay but im not going to be able to make heads or tails of any of this shit  liam yes i have questions about it as well  marisha yeah  matt caleb you are the one who is the most proficient with understanding systems if you  /none/ could make an intelligence check for me as well both you and molly since molly was the first to  grab them  liam oh natural one  marisha oh nosies  sam hes eating that extra meat pie  taliesin eight  matt you both take a moment and look over it one its all written in gnomish do either of  you guys understand gnomish as a language  taliesin does anybody understand gnomish  sam gnome  matt secondly a lot of the blueprints are in shorthand and the design work while its very  beautiful to /none/ see the actual sketching of each stage of its construction and the interior  mechanisms about it are very beautiful it is very intricate paying attention to it and looking it  over the best you can ascertain is there is a core there is some sort of a device that powers  it through the notes around it its supposed to power for about 200 years before it needs  replacing  sam just wait it out  liam its a good halflife  marisha its a duracell  matt however around it is layer after layer of metallic /none/ iron rings that are joined at certain  hinge points so they can spin and shift in the inside like a gyroscope  taliesin its very hard to get a spell in there  matt yes its not impossible if you pull enough of the armor away which is the next stage the  layers of armor theres three different layers of articulated armor that can shift and move because  on the inside there are about a dozen bladed arms that at any given point in time can fold out of  the armor and strike like small scythes /none/ or sickles and then retract inside  sam you are fucking crazy cleff  matt thats certainly not the first time ive heard that  liam yeah so herr tinkertop once we are to get past these defenses would dispelling its  arcane nature shut the machine down  matt i mean thats possible oh curses i shouldve thought of some way of a failsafe to  prevent that from happening well next design next design itll be dispelproof thank you for  that youre a good  liam the nutshell protecting that core needs to be defeated first  /none/ matt i imagine to a certain extent there is a base level of insulation from impactful or various  magical intrusions that could affect the core that i did think of but theres only really one  i shouldve put three  taliesin we start pulling plates off  matt he starts making notes feverishly  taliesin  start cutting our way through one specific spot we could eventually get to a point  where you could get some spells in there  sam or maybe yasha could hit it with her sword  taliesin you may have to tank /none/ this  ashley i will certainly try this does seem like a very  taliesin is there a front and back to this thing or is it just a whirling dervish  matt the front and back is dervish thats a great pirate word dervish he looks to you and  goes there is kind of he goes through one of the papers and pulls it open and there are plates  of the armor certain plates that fold up from the inside they open and there is a small lens  like a crystaltype lens that recesses on the /none/ inside when its moving and then seems to push out  from it to see  marisha okay  sam question can it climb  matt depending on the terrain probably if its flatwalled surfaces its not designed for  climbing its designed for intimidation and slaughtering perhaps my design was a bit  unfocused for the reason they asked me to build it but ah next time climbing i dont know  probably not  liam and does it have any capabilities of attacking at range  matt as far as i know no but it moves very fast /none/  marisha these lenses im assuming theyre regular lenses i dont know they can still be  blinded right  matt maybe theyre made of a very thick crystalline substance that had to be imported from  up north from the remnants of one of the old elven societies there that specialized in making strong  crystal  marisha so its super cheap and easy to break imported great  taliesin it could possibly be blinded by obscuring the lens  matt maybe  marisha i was going to say if we can get something to blind it its still /none/ just a lens  matt starts writing down more notes make sure lens cant be obscured in a future design  sam cleff when you were building this thing you were building it offsite i assume right  matt no i built it here  sam no i mean off the prison site not  matt oh right  sam so you dont know any extra secret entrances or exits to the prison itself  matt no unfortunately they keep us away from all of that for security reasons so i couldnt  help people break in or out like /none/ now  that wouldve been very helpful sorry  liam would it be foolish to have you speak on our behalf to usher us in  matt i dont think theyre going to let me in  taliesin not you in per se but if we show up as representatives here to dismantle the machine  liam yes youre finally ready to make amends et cetera  taliesin and you hired us to go in and do some work  matt maybe he looks at rissa rissa would you mind bringing your old pops with you shes  like only /none/ to the door dad then you can come back she glares over the two of you if thats  necessary  taliesin whatever works  matt fine come along then well close up behind get your keys oh i havent been down  for a proper walk with friends in some time im so excited  taliesin we should get some honey or something i bet some honey on the lens would be a real pain in  the ass  matt he takes the last bit of meat pie and shoves it in his mouth real fast  taliesin /none/ do you have any honey  matt unintelligible shouting  liam i have honey  taliesin of course you do  liam yeah  marisha why not something darker like ash charcoal black powder  liam i have that as well  taliesin what do you have  liam i have molasses  marisha that is darker  taliesin why do you have molasses this is suddenly very exciting  liam i will tell you that in a few minutes actually if thats all right  matt jester goes this entire time youve been holding out on delicious molasses  /none/ liam its industrial grade it is not for baking  matt are you sure  liam i am quite sure did i stutter  taliesin is this why your skin is so smooth youve been giving yourself a facial every night  ashley wait whats the difference between baking and industrial grade  liam that is a good question yasha i dont cook with it i use it for arcane things  taliesin magic molasses  marisha actually this brings up a how much molasses do you have  matt as fjord yeah how much you carrying  marisha thats /none/ so weird it’s so abrasive sometimes  liam i have about the amount of a plum wrapped in  sam thats enough to smear a lens  taliesin i was thinking if we had a small glass jar of it we could give it a throw  ashley we could also put a meat pie in the  sam i could put a meat pie on the end of one of my bolts and shoot it at it  matt as fjord piechucker  marisha i feel like molasses would gum up something thats clockwork right  taliesin it could /none/ help it depends on how strong the clockwork is  sam or just tar or something  marisha yeah something sticky  taliesin bubble gum  liam that would be even better if we could get our hands on  sam maybe on the walk we can see if we can find a tar restaurant  matt rissa goes i mean tar is not uncommonly used in some of the industrial districts down in  the iron lot  taliesin and we do have some friends over there that we just sent their young interns away on a  matt /none/ well the forge masters theyre mainly in metalwork as far as tar use thats going to be  down in the iron lot and thats going to be youre on your own there  marisha i mean how do we transport it  sam in a bucket  taliesin in a very gentle bucket or pot  marisha heated tar in a bucket  taliesin it doesnt have to be hot it just has to be  sam it has to be a little hot  taliesin has to be a little hot  marisha yeah it gets hard its /none/ tar  matt fjord goes if only we knew someone around here who is pretty decent with fire  sam hey you could heat up a bucket of tar as we walk into a prison that wouldnt be suspicious at all  marisha once we get down once we get down  liam that is a good idea fjord also fjord congratulations on this your most auspicious day  matt why thank you i appreciate you being so forthright and appreciative caleb  liam yeah get your sleep while you can and dont use the exercise ball to rock him /none/ to sleep  because then they get addicted to it and thats the end of your sleep life yourself  matt i have no idea what the hell youre talking about  ashley did you babysit a lot as a kid caleb is this how you know so much  liam oh no  taliesin theres so many walls being broken theres like fourth wall fifth wall sixth wall  its too deep  matt you just broke the prismatic wall  taliesin we’re in the eleventh dimension now this is getting a little heavy  marisha he totally just /none/ took a thank you for not his baby being born  sam this is the worst night ever  taliesin can i remove that  ashley please take it off  sam no i’m committed  marisha i feel like at break time last time it came off  liam yeah  marisha you made it to break i think  sam ive got two spares if i need it  marisha ashley and taliesin no  marisha dont do this to yourself  matt at this point as you guys are having this awkward conversation cleff is rushing around /none/  grabbing a coat and grabbing some other things filling the inside of his apron with various tools  and utensils oh i can probably use that all right i think im ready to come with you  sam lets go  matt you all step outside and you get about 30 or so feet before you see cleff’s pace is slowing  he takes another step and keeps looking around  marisha when was the last time you left your house cleff  matt its been a while its starting to get a little warm rissa is like hes /none/ kind of a  whats the term  marisha agoraphobic  matt agoraphobic if you will hes a bit iffy on the outside are you sure youre all right  dad you can still stay no no its fine i want to hang out with my friends here nervous laugh  sam do you need a drink to soothe your nerves  matt i dont ive never had a drink i dont need a drink but thank you  sam but it would really help  matt well i and looks over  taliesin how about just a huddle up /none/ huddle up lets just  marisha just us  taliesin no we can put him in the center  marisha huddle around him okay we perform a protective  matt you all get really close to him hes like oh this is really warm this is a lot of attention  marisha no not that close were making a safety bubble  matt oh all right  taliesin i mean it could be warm  liam this is silly i take off the cloak that ive been wearing for a week or so now and i just  put it /none/ over the mans head  matt muffled yelp  liam no oh sorry  sam and matt in a comforting way  laughter  liam to disguise his appearance  sam in a smothering way  matt he takes it and pulls it over his head all right and he lets go nervous chuckle and  is like one step two step hes basically bill murray in what about bob at this point hes  concentrating on each step he makes going forward its slowing you down a little bit but  hes making it forward rissa is like exasperated /none/ groan you eventually make your way  further and further  sam were just going to walk up to the guards and say were here to dismantle the robit right  taliesin we are professional robot dismantlers  sam all right lets do it whos going to be doing the talking  taliesin well were going to stop and pick up some tar on the way there and i nominate the  human to talk  marisha ah i cant nominate fjord  sam yeah yeah no i think fjord would agree with that  marisha do you believe in /none/ me fjord  matt you know if i have learned anything it is that you are full of surprises so by all means  marisha all right tar first  sam tar first where do we go for tar the iron lot  matt rissa looks iron lots most likely ill keep an eye out follow me she leads you guys  down the switchback path once more down to the iron lot the bottom shelf of the city there  upon keeping an eye out rissa is looking back and forth on the outskirts of the firemark facility  /none/ shes like no i dont think theyre going to do much as far as tar goes honestly a lot of its  probably based somewhere in the assembly yard thats where theyre making the bigger constructs  and having to piece together wood exteriors  marisha is that far from here  matt no its on the northern side of the bottom shelf she leads you guys over to the outskirts  and there is a big fence that wraps around the assembly yard where a lot of these thin standing  skeletal towers of metal are placed against some /none/ constructs that are in partial levels of  construction others are empty and not currently in use other ones seem to have been near  completion and theyre in the process of preparing and breaking down the various siege  engine for transport to the east whos keeping an eye out to see if there’s anything that could be  used like tar whos looking for this  sam ill look for that  matt all right make a perception check please  sam 18  matt 18 not too bad you take about five minutes or so to case /none/ the vicinity and looking between  the gate you can see two towers over there is one partially constructed wide boltthrower cart that  only has one thats currently bolted to it you see that theyre taking leather elements and tarring them  around the edges to prevent any sort of impacts from splintering the wood thats carrying it it  looks like from there they go with a leather case and put metal over that and bolt it down but in  the process they do have what looks to be a couple of small pails that have some /none/ thick black  tarlike substance that theyre putting around the edges  sam and were behind a gate and theres workers everywhere  matt theres probably within current view of the open portion of this side of the assembly yard  about 20 or so workers that are in the middle of focusing on their work at hand but its in an  open space with maybe 20 to 30 feet open between each project tower so its pretty open youd  have to be creative  sam this is at the assembly yard  matt correct  marisha i /none/ take my staff out and i go vibrating ring across the gate  sam ah why would you no  matt as you do so vibrating ring across it rissa goes ah and you look at the nearby  tower maybe 25 or 30 feet ahead to the north of you one of the gnomes at the top of the tower is  currently hammering away at one of the large constructs siege towerlike structures looks  over pulls the goggles up hello  marisha good money or trade for some supplies  matt piss off puts the goggles down /none/ hammering  sam we could just walk in and pretend to be a worker and just grab a bucket  marisha i thought were behind a gate like locked out  sam we could just sneak in the gate  marisha just sneak in  liam i have an idea i could summon schmidt and it would be a slow process but he could carry it  a couple of inches low to the ground and wait and then go a couple of feet  sam whats his range  liam oh lets see  sam how far is it /none/ matt  matt the nearest the one little part of the yard that theyre currently using this material is  about 60 feet away from you 60 to 70 from your immediate guess at a glance  liam oh it is about that distance  matt okay  liam so it might be just shy or lets give it a whirl just give me tenish minutes  sam ten minutes oh okay  liam thats not bad i pull a book out of my holster and flip to the right page and start  muttering does anyone want to do /none/ anything in those nine minutes left  sam ill walk around and see if theres a way through the gate thats hidden  matt make an investigation check  taliesin ill keep an eye on the guard not on the guard ill keep an eye on the worker  sam ten  matt ten you take the ten minutes to look through but this part of the gate is pretty  solidly locked in its about six and a half seven feet tall and its just metal bars with  almost a crosslattice of even thinner metal strips that are /none/ about a quarterinch thick the  openings are about that big so you can still see through like portholes but its not quite large  enough for most of you to slip through you might be able to if youre careful and squeeze since  youre small enough  marisha and they’re mainly gnomes working this  matt gnomes and you see a handful of dwarves but the dwarves seem to be mostly doing oversight  supervision  marisha okay so i like as a plan b you disguising yourself as a gnome worker  sam okay lets see if /none/ schmidt can  marisha do it first  matt so you complete your spell ritual you summon your unseen servant  liam ja schmidt one second you two circus people mollymauk  taliesin yeah yeah  liam could ah thats cute could the two of you do something fabulous over there  ashley make a distraction  liam ja  sam juggle something  ashley yeah i could have you stand on my shoulders  taliesin we could do that thing do you remember the vaulty thing lets do the vaulting thing all  right youre going to do the /none/ thing over the vault up  ashley okay ready  matt at which point cleff goes oh were going to see a performance  ashley yeah get ready  liam i preemptively send schmidt over to the closest bucket  matt and the range on that is it cannot get more than 60 feet than you right  liam ja that is correct  matt okay so what are the two of you doing  taliesin if you get near the fence im going to try and jump on top of the fence  ashley great  taliesin all right /none/ were going to need the mumbling  sam wait youre going to jump the fence no this is a distraction youre not supposed to jump  in the  taliesin im going to jump on top of the fence  sam oh god  ashley are you going to go in or are you just going  taliesin no im just going to do the mumbling  ashley razzle dazzle  taliesin yeah like the razzle dazzle  matt all right so  liam heres a question im sorry how wide apart is it bars the fence what kind of /none/ fence  do we have  matt there are large metal poles incrementally about every 12 or so feet in between there it  looks like there are cross lattices of an inch wide and a quarterinch thick metal bars that  weave across to form the fence  liam so that bucket is not going between any of that  matt probably not  liam nott would you be able to use your invisible hand to lift that up and over  sam when schmidt comes close enough yes  liam okay  matt all right you guys are /none/ prepared  taliesin yep  matt i would like you to make an acrobatics check with advantage because youre being aided by  yasha  marisha ill keep watch  taliesin oof ten  matt ten as you reach down grabbing the foot of mollymauk with one big grunt you lift him and  he tosses in the air gracefully arms out almost like a reverse swan dive into the air you land  and impact  groaning  matt land legs open you manage to miss the vital areas but it definitely wracks the inside of the  thigh /none/ a little bit a painful landing  taliesin can i try and push up into a handstand  matt you manage to do so but it lacks the presentational and grace element of it make a  performance check but with disadvantage from the impact  liam so when he crashes right at that moment i ask schmidt to move the bucket three feet closer  to us low to the ground  taliesin all right  ashley can i aid him okay  taliesin yeah natural 20 oh no disadvantage 15  matt 15 okay still pretty good so /none/ in spite of the strained impact you slowly stagger back up  to the top balance yourself  taliesin up and flipping back up and im going get the swords out im going to start slowly  working on moving down the fence with both swords doing a spin and trying to actually get a little  flip going a little acrobatic  liam oh boy another ten feet towards me  taliesin ill need you spotting cause im not great at this  matt all right youre turning it around its starting to work into your advantage as this /none/ is  happening schmidt is slowly dragging on its own the unseen servant is dragging this bucket three  feet at a time scraping  marisha im keeping watch for any workers who might be noticing the bucket  matt none seem to be noticing the bucket at the moment but you do see about three or four that  are looking over at this very colorful flashy performing nearly wracked tiefling who is in the  process of juggling swords in the air and doing a series of completely spontaneous performance art  for no reason  marisha bravo /none/ bravo  matt you see two of the nearby workers start looking over confused start talking to each  other you can hear the muttering one of them runs off to one of the supervisor dwarves whos  about 80 to 100 feet off to go tell him whats happening he looks over and eventually you hear  as schmidt is getting closer and closer the bucket of tar is maybe 20 feet from the  fenceline and you hear a voice go hey hey what are you doing get down from there get go  on get get get /none/  taliesin im going to jump onto your shoulders now so i take a jump and try and land on the  shoulders straight acrobatics  matt straight acrobatics for this  taliesin all right you go away im trying you thats a natural 20  ashley ooh  matt flipping impact landing right onto yashas shoulders she catches you there and  youre still from their perspective you jumped off of the fence and landed behind the fence and are  ashley im going to do a little side by side walking to make it look like hes  /none/ taliesin sorry you had a great fence and were working on an act  matt make a deception check  taliesin its true  marisha nott how close does mage hand have to be  sam it could go now but we cant go fast theyll see a moving bucket  liam yeah we dont want it off the ground  taliesin thats nine  matt nine okay its not that they dont buy it theyre just more caught offguard by your presence and not  listening to the words youre saying the one supervisor who keeps rushing forward goes /none/ you  know lad you dont have permission show me your at which point you see cleff looking  nervously steps forward and goes hello there cleff tinkertop were all right theyre with  me the dwarf comes to a slow jog to a stop and goes cleff what the fuck are you doing down  here schmidt drags the bucket about 15 feet off to the side and it is near the base of the fence  sam okay ill cast mage hand  matt okay  sam are people looking right now  matt yes they are looking /none/  sam okay  matt its about 1520 feet to the left but theyre currently focused on your group which is  gathered at the edge of the yard where they assemble all of their very powerful military  weapons  taliesin we should be at separate ends of the fence right now because i made my way down the  fence with yasha  matt right so it was about 30 feet well say so are you attempting to  sam im just going to wait until they finish their conversation  matt all right  liam ill try /none/ to edge it a little closer still id like to get it near the fence if i can  matt its actually right now with that final scoot from schmidt its right up against the  fence on the opposite side  liam okay then im just going to wait for the right moment then ill have schmidt lift it over  his head but not yet  matt okay at this point the dwarf rushes up to the edge and peers through and goes so strange  arrivals you got here cleff and a couple of loonies diving off /none/ the outside of our very  wellprotected fence but sure cleff whats your business with these assholes hes like were  making our way to try and make right some mistakes ive made certainly hopefully he glances through  with a bit of a tightened gaze and goes all right well just keep them off my fence  taliesin a lovely fence it is  matt turns around and starts walking back to his post  sam as he starts walking ill nod to caleb and try to do the lift over the fence  liam oh jeez i go /none/  matt make a sleight of hand check to see if you can make the right timing and do so swift enough  to where nobody seems to notice  sam sleight of hand 22  matt with that as soon as the dwarf turns around and all the rest of the workers go right back  simultaneously seeing that this encounter is over turn back to their work whooshing without  a sound rises over the fence and is now at your disposal on the opposite end  sam yeah  ashley hopefully that will do something  sam /none/ we have a bucket of tar part one of our plan is complete  liam thats how you do it you set them up and knock them down  sam look at that teamwork  marisha it was pretty good  sam yeah everybody contributed a little except for jester and fjord everyone was really good  talisin when do they ever contribute really  matt laughter rissa goes all right thats the first part of it whats next  ashley i guess we head to the prison  marisha to the prison  sam lets put the tar bucket /none/ in the haversack of holding if thats possible if it will fit  marisha will it tip over in the bag  matt she takes it and slowly puts it inside it will fit in the larger one so it slips inside the  bag she closes it okay are you sure it wont turn over  marisha and taliesin no  sam i dont know  matt i dont want to ruin my bag  taliesin then we dont have to put it in well just carry it  matt i paid good money for it and its so /none/ pretty  taliesin well carry it  sam then were carrying a bucket of tar is that weird  taliesin were going in to kill a robot its fine  sam all right well just carry it  taliesin what else do you bring into a  what do they think were going to do with a bucket of tar  ashley ill take it  matt carefully hands it to yasha  taliesin lets lean into it  ashley yeah  matt rissa continues pushing you now away from the assembly yard back into the iron lot and  /none/ towards the exterior of the gearhold prison there on the outside of this doorway theres  about a dozen crownsguard mostly gnomish two human it looks like theyre both currently  decorated with a bit more detail probably sent from the capital or at least are given a little  more of import to the outside of this guarding post as you approach you can see these large  metal doors there are two of them and they open in the center and there are a set of smaller  doors built in the base of each of the sides /none/ as you approach some of the crownsguard look over  curiously at this interesting wayward group making their way towards the outside three of  them begin to approach and one of the humans in the more intricate crownsguard uniform approaches  throwing the cloak over his shoulder and you can see his hand resting on the handle of his  nowsheathed sword hey who goes there what is your business  marisha we are a contracted group of workers working for this man right here cleff were here  to take care of the problem that we heard you /none/ guys had with the clockwork warden  matt cleff pulls the hood back a bit and goes hello guy takes a moment and looks make a  persuasion check with advantage because cleff is helping you  sam yeah persuasive beau  marisha i stole this die that i got you from forever ago its got the little d20 inside of it  ill take the 12 for 13  matt the guard steps back a bit looks you over all right hold tight a second im going to  summon the warden just a moment he steps to one /none/ of the small doors that opens and he disappears inside  sam how many doors are there  matt theres the two large main doors about 15 feet tall about 20 foot wide and then theres  smaller doors normal personsized almost gnomishsized doors built into it from that  point you actually watch as the human crownsguard has to duck a little bit to go through the smaller  door frame hes gone for about five minutes or so and then returns and says the wardenhelm  would wish to speak to you if you wouldnt mind stepping inside /dung/ dont mind the escort its  common business  marisha what did you say the wardens name was  matt its wardenhelm poppin drokrusher  marisha wardenhelm poppin  matt poppin drokrusher  marisha drokrusher  taliesin poppin drok i wont i wont speak im not going to speak  matt hes like gnomish names  taliesin i feel that  matt at that point you guys are led inside the dark interior as soon as you step into the shadow  of the entryway of this prison you go from the industrial and somewhat colorless iron lot that  /none/ youve been traveling through to this very lowlit reddish almost oxidized iron interior  that is just shadow and torches you can see these large support beams of metal put against the rock  and stone that has been carved out of the interior of the mountain its just one long hallway that  splinters off into a number of hallways to the right and left before it reaches the outside of  your current visual range to make any more detail out of it at this point as you enter about five  more of the crownsguard follow behind /none/ you and keep you all as a small pack traveling at this point  he begins to move forward and gestures for you all to follow saying this way leads you down the  hall scooting to the right and heads to the right at the very first branching hallway of the  interior of the prison heading further down theres a few doors that are open and on the  inside they appear to be empty or theres a few other guards on the interior you dont see much  in the way of crownsguard you see a different /none/ type of guard similar garb but more drab and  you get the sense that theyre this is an internal prison guard this isnt part of the  paid trained citywide guard these are the interior hupperdook prison guards no more than  maybe another 40 or so feet down theres a doorway thats open that leads into an office on  the inside of this office which itself is also super darkly lit you see two ember torches that  give this very dull red glow on the inside of the room so it has this somewhat ominous and /none/ dreary  interior presence to it as you step into this chamber the desk is facing away from you and  there you see an older and grizzled gnome who is in the process of wearing these series of robes  and cloak over him with these goldcolored tassels and epaulets that shoot off the sides seems to be  giving out an air of station and importance even though its just in the process of filing what  looks to be either prison transfers or people that have been arrested and figuring out whos to be  put in /none/ here and why or whose business is going to come to an end soon hes in the process of  shuffling through papers before turning around to you and goes all right so you have come to my  prison stands up and turns around to you clicking his feet together as he does so at  attention arms crossed hello im the wardenhelm poppin you have bothered me from my  work and i would like to know why as you look at him you can see his hair has receded almost  entirely to the back and what /none/ bits of clustered gray hair on the sides he’s currently attempted to  slick and comb back and one large part of it is trying to cover the massive bald spot but as he  spins around and talks to you with any sort of movement it wobbles and has to settle itself back  into place  taliesin beau  marisha first off  taliesin i tap beau on the back and make her bow a little bit  marisha you dont have to okay  matt respectful i appreciate that  taliesin pull her back up  matt /none/ rissa has backed away to the doorway and is like and doesnt want any part in this  marisha yeah same rissa same we will not take up much of your time if you just let us in to go  kill this clockwork warden that this guy made we heard he was quite a problem just let us in  well be out of your hair and you can get back to your work  matt wait what are you and he looks over towards the cloaked gnomish figure to the side  what  marisha remember this guy /none/  matt he leans forward and as the cloak is pulled back cleff reveals his face a bit he goes  hello there its been a while how are you doing poppin hes like interesting riffraff  youre bringing to my home this day  marisha why do people keep calling us that  taliesin to be fair we are  matt i was referring to cleff cleff why do you come and bother me with my days work what do you  want youre saying something about your little mistake your problem  marisha look this guy is funding /none/ to take care of the spinning death machine thats in your guys  basement this should be a cityfunded issue but this guy is being a good noble citizen and  funding it himself so we can come and make a quick buck and kill your death robot can we please just  go kill your damn death robot  matt he looks at cleff is this true cleff nods actually yes i know its been a problem  for a while and i figured about time i cleaned up that mess myself if you dont mind the  wardenhelm /none/ stops for a second and looks amongst the rest of you right okay you have what  appears to be an interesting crew of exterminators youve brought to me what do you want from me i  assume you have come here for trade or for looking for some sort of recompense i would like to know  what that is before we move further into this no one steps inside here wishing to do us how you  say charity work  taliesin oh of course that makes perfect sense and of course a man of your stature would /none/ be smart  enough to know that such a thing is true we honestly we will admit we may have a favor a  very minor favor to ask if everything goes well and we do in fact survive this encounter in  return also we will be gathering very valuable data on how to defeat these sort of automatons  which will be put into your possession and would definitely help you deliver something that could  help with the war effort this sort of data could get back to the people in charge and help them  defeat /none/ machines in the future were trying new techniques new ways to defeat these sort of automatons  marisha you look like a man whos willing to climb a ladder  taliesin i think you could go far wed be happy to help  marisha war is a great time for opportunity my friend  taliesin we may discuss perhaps if we can help we have two friends who are currently in  your system and we would be more than happy to discuss a means of maybe resolving their issue  with you not innocence but just coming to a /none/ conclusion that is mutually agreeable  matt make a persuasion check with advantage with aiding from beau and a very persuasive  argument actually  taliesin man i love bullshitting  marisha laughs highfivesies from across the table  taliesin persuasion god please for once in your miserable life oh man eight  matt oh buddy  liam not life just this campaign taliesin  taliesin i know  matt well perhaps we can discuss but i would like to see possibly this deed you wish to do done  first i do not wish to talk contracts with those /none/ who are about to die if you know what im saying  taliesin hardly waste your time  marisha who would  matt very well he looks past you to the escort of guards that have followed you in lead them to  the subterranean sealed chamber allow them to encounter our issue and should they survive  return them to me with proof of the deed should they not survive we will not speak of this ever  again good luck i will be here waiting to hear of your successful endeavor now leave me to my  work /none/ he goes and sits back down in his chair  sam were doing this now  taliesin of course we are anyone want the node  sam if im going to be throwing tar at this thing maybe i should have it  taliesin or caleb well whos going to be throwing   marisha whos going to be throwing the tar you with your mage hand maybe  sam i could  taliesin well heat it up caleb will heat it up youll throw it in and then ill be using some  ice to try and cool the /none/ thing down once its in there  marisha yasha and i can try and pin it down maybe corner it  taliesin once it starts opening up the armor well just go to that one particular plate and  start ripping a hole in it  marisha start ripping the plates off  taliesin chopping the plates off  ashley okay  liam lets heat that tar up before entering  marisha lets get to the door heat it up  taliesin well get through doors set the node set everything we need into action  matt cleff and rissa /none/ balk there as you guys are having this conversation rissa goes if its not  a problem ill stay here with my dad and well just wait to hear what happens were not much in  the way of charging into the fray  liam of course you have tasked experts with this job  matt of course cleff pushes past and goes but before you go i just want once more to express my  extreme gratitude for your putting yourself out there for my wellbeing a tinkertop never forgets  these deeds and should you return safely i /none/ will be in your debt he bows and the cloak thumps  onto the groundand he goes oh he picks it back up and bows a little less this time  marisha any last tips cleff  matt be careful  marisha thats a good one  taliesin what kind of feet does it have again  matt oh it doesnt have feet it rolls  taliesin ball bearings  marisha hamster ball  taliesin well see slow it down i dont know well find out  marisha i dont know  sam all right so the guards will take /none/ us down  matt you guys currently have a group of six crownsguard from the outside and a couple of  prison guards that will lead you there  taliesin tank this and youll be all right its just swords  ashley i want to get a good look at it but this sounds like a fun challenge  taliesin fjord you got a plan jester  matt jester goes well dont die and if you fall over ill try to get you not on the ground anymore  sam she cant shes out of spells  matt how is /none/ she out of spells you guys took a long rest  sam didnt we use a bunch  taliesin no we took a long rest  matt she used two locate objects i know that  sam those are highlevel spells  matt theyre 2ndlevel i think isnt it  sam okay does it say how many spells she has left  taliesin it should  matt yeah locate object is 2ndlevel  marisha to be fair i think we were going to rest and we decided against it we decided to go  sam oh it reset but she /none/ definitely had used some  marisha we know she used two  matt shes used two 2ndlevel spells  ashley she has used two 2ndlevel spells  matt so well mark those in there if she had another its fine shes not here to keep track  taliesin do we want her to have anything precast i dont think duplicity will matter but  maybe a spiritual weapon already called up  liam spiritual weapon is a good idea  taliesin just have it already lets  matt well it only lasts for a minute  taliesin oh then lets /none/ wait then all right  sam in case this all goes titsup do we want to try to talk to these guards and maybe figure out  what cell the schusters are in  taliesin youre welcome to try  sam im not talking to them but someone with more charisma than me  taliesin certainly not me  marisha fjords literally the only one that can charm a guard unless we bribe a guard  liam that is incorrect  sam oh charming caleb  liam clears throat i can speak when i have to  marisha do some /none/ suggestion stuff  sam i mean is that worth doing now  liam no i can just talk  taliesin i mean if we die does it matter  sam no but i mean if the warden doesnt give us what we want  taliesin we can talk to the guards on the way out  sam okay but were in the prison  taliesin yeah but were going to be in the prison when were done  sam all right  taliesin thats fair  sam okay  taliesin laughs assuming we live  matt the guards have led /none/ you away from that end of the chamber down the hall back to the main  hallway that enters deeper into the gearhold prison following that down for another 80 or so  feet that main open hallway comes to an end and there are a number of other small hallways that  protrude the guards lead you down the one on the left you can see two immediately that branch off  on the far end of that main open way that leftside pathway leads to a set of stairs that  spirals down to a second floor then /dung/ a third floor then a fourth floor the fourth floor is  the bottom of these stairs and youre now probably guessing from the time its taken you to  descend the spiral staircase maybe an additional 100 to 120 feet below the entrance and the actual  level base of the mountain at this point you continue down a hallway and there are cells to  your right and left as you enter the space the cells are very wellfortified and behind the  bars in the dark dark red emberlike torchlight that faintly glows and lights elements of /none/ this  hallway as you continue down you can see shapes humanoid shapes locked behind bars of all shapes  and sizes as you begin to pass one on the right you watch as a figure lurches up to the bars  pushes up to the edge and what faint bit of red light you can see illuminating a face that looks  scarred by a large heavy clawmark down one side the eye glued shut from the healing process you  see this toothy rotten grin underneath as a nasty smell of breath emanates from its heavy breathing  /none/ and as you pass by it says hey are you going to come back are you where are you going where  are you going come back and you walk past one of the guards takes their shortsword and clangs it  across the metal and goes keep back keep back  taliesin mr schuster you look terrible i yell very loud to see if anybody responds to the name  matt to what name  taliesin mr schuster  matt schuster okay you listen make a perception check  sam yeah sure  taliesin oh thats a 15  /none/ matt okay you listen out and you hear a few voices chuckle and some shifting of people that  are now making their way to the front of the cell to see what this arriving group of strangers is  but nothing out of the expected ordinary reacting to that name  taliesin worth a shot  matt a few other figures push their way to the face and you can see men and women you can see  decrepit halfelves that look poorly nourished you can see humans that look like theyve smeared  themselves with their own foul /none/ excrement you can see a whole nature of people that are in the  process of dealing with being locked down here in the subterranean basement level of this prison  and then at the end you come to what looks to be an iron door that is currently sealed shut with  what looks to be rung after rung after rung of chains pulled through across bars locked with  three padlocks  marisha is this the door  matt the main guard sitting there goes aye it is he pulls out a ring of keys  taliesin whens /none/ the last time you opened it  matt when we sealed it  ashley which was  matt about a little over two years ago  marisha how big is this chamber in here  matt it leads down splits in the middle and has two more sets of cells in the back side  marisha splits in the middle two more sets of cells on the back side so it looks like a big  fork does it have a common way or is this thing patrolling halls  matt i dont know  liam and what will happen /none/ when we go inside here are you locking us in  matt damn right  taliesin until we knock on the door i imagine  liam until which  matt with that one latch and one lock comes free pulls it off and hands it to the guard  sam im going to look at the  matt second lock comes free  sam the dodecahedron while were at it  matt you take a moment to concentrate on it  marisha should we heat up the tar  taliesin lets heat up the tar  liam okay nott can /none/ you lift that thing up for me  sam lift  taliesin ill hold it since youre doing the thing  sam oh sure  liam well its going to scald the bejeezus out of your hands if i  sam okay ill use mage hand to hold it up  taliesin i also have immunity to flame so or not quite immunity but i dont really mind flame  liam well i could semiburn your hands or not burn notts makebelieve one  sam yeah ill hold it with my mage hand  matt all right so with that /none/ the bucket of tar is now being held aloft from the floating  spectral mage hand that nott is controlling  taliesin well probably need some light in here too  marisha so he can cast two spells they have to be at third level  matt correct  marisha and his cantrips are so if he casts armor of agathys its going to take up one  of his levels  matt correct  marisha and hex would be another one  matt correct  liam everybody back away from this bucket and i crackle my hands and send /none/ a fire bolt at the  bottom of it  matt all right so being careful not to destroy the bucket itself which while it is made of  metal youre uncertain of its structural integrity but you do focus on a little slow burn  of this flame controlling the fire bolt to be a gradual burn as you do you watch as the metal  iron of the bottom of this bucket begin to heat to a dull orange into a brighter orange and after a  few moments of concentrating you can see a faint bubbling the /none/ tar seems to be heating and to a  fairly more liquidy consistency than its rather cold and more solid form that you found it in  taliesin excellent  liam that is the most relaxed that spell has ever gone  matt laughs at which point the third lock comes off the guards begin pulling the chains through  the various loops until eventually the door is exposed creaking opens and on the inside  theres a few steps that descend into what looks to be a double door beyond that one of the doors  is partially opened /none/ and it is darkness with a faint red glow beyond that  marisha this place is creepy as shit  taliesin i turn to one of the guards is there any light in there or are we going to need to  bring our own  matt theres probably some light but it wouldnt hurt to bring your own especially for  that one and points to caleb  liam yasha could i borrow a torch from you  ashley yes of course  liam so your hands are free to work  ashley yes good idea here  liam /none/ danke  marisha fjords going to cast armor of agathys on himself  matt so as fjord touches the front of his chest armor you watch as the cold air solidifies  getting this mist and bits of ice crystal protruding from his leather armor  marisha hope that is a good call what would fjord do and beau puts on her goggles  matt you got it  marisha like fjord eldritch blast  matt as all of you are ushered past the metal door the guards all gather on the opposite side  and the lead guard of /none/ the unit goes very well may the platinum dragon guide you closes the  door and you hear the chains on the opposite side being locked as you all turn back looking down  the six or seven feet of descending stairs before it levels into the double doors partially opened  and the darkness beyond and thats where were going to take a quick break  sam ah oh but we were about to fight  matt well were going to dive into that just because if we go into a battle it might take a  little while /none/ well take the break now before that and then we can dive into it immediately as  we return  liam lets try diplomacy  matt perfect shiny blade balls are easy to talk to  marisha dear spinning death machine  taliesin fantasmagoria im definitely having some yeah  matt all righty guys so well be back here in a few minutes were going to take a five or ten  minute break to get ourselves comfy like rissa food water and other releases of functions  marisha thanks rissa  matt and well see you guys here in /none/ just a moment so hang tight in the chat if you want to  well have a couple of fun videos to watch and once again if you havent seen the kickstarter of  these awesome minis you can go to critrolecom for all that information they have the links  there to the kickstarter the guys at steamforged have done an amazing job and we hope you like  them all right well see you here in a few minutes  break  matt and welcome back wow  laughter  liam wow indeed  matt indeed so welcome /none/ back coming back into the game you have all descended down and reached  the double doors partially open and stepped quietly into the interior chamber of this sealed  portion of the gearhold prison there is what looks like a faint flicker of those same  emberlight torches that give off faint bits of red glow but a number the walls seem to have been  damaged actually as you step inside you get a quick look the doors that are behind you and the  walls around you are scraped and gashed from hundreds and hundreds of blade /none/ marks it looks  like whatever in here has spent a lot of time grinding around and looking of a means of escape  or patrolling with its blades out over and over again parts of the walls have fallen in a bit and  there is rubble in areas where its starting to erode away the interior of this sealed chamber  but everywhere you look to the right left and along the ground all you see are hundreds and  hundreds of bladelike grooves in the stone  sam thats not good  ashley this is as you /none/ know ive heard the kids say these days creepy af  taliesin actually its got eyes and not ears i dont think when we saw the blueprints was there  any way for it to detect sound or was it all visual  matt without your massive intelligence roll you werent able to discern that information unfortunately  taliesin all right  marisha whispering im going to assume yes hey jester cooing  taliesin lets pretend were whispering  marisha cooing okay maybe pass without a trace jester cooing  taliesin we can do that lets cast pass without a /none/ trace im going to light up my sword  matt that is a 2ndlevel spell if i recall  taliesin that would be our last 2ndlevel spell wait lets  marisha maybe not  taliesin maybe not pass without a trace because once it sees us it doesnt matter anymore  so lets not do that yet  marisha okay nevermind keep going  taliesin im going to light up my swords  matt both of them  taliesin yeah with ice  matt okay  taliesin that brings me down to 49 hit points so thats fun wow that’ll /none/ be a lot of fun thats  thrilling theres a door over there do you want to sneak over and see  sam sure ill sneak over to the door and try to unlock it  matt over here  sam or see if its locked  matt all right it is a set of prison bars there is a gate that is currently locked the bars  themselves once again you can see rows and rows of gashes and scrapes across the metal theyre  bowed in a bit from impacts repeatedly its slightly bent inward you can attempt /none/ to pick a  lock if youd like  sam ill pick a lock  matt go ahead and roll thats proficiency bonus plus dexterity  sam thats is a 14  matt a 14 clicking its not triggering the lock these are not easy locks to get through  theyre designed to hold prisoners unfortunately so theyre fairly hardy locks you spend a while  with it and are unable to hit those tumblers it looks like its not going to open make a  perception check as youre looking through the bars  sam four  liam i /none/ sneak up behind nott  matt all right  liam whispering i can open this if you need me to i just like to save my shit  sam i dont know whats in it i cant see anything through it can i  matt not with that perception roll no you see bits of rock you see some cloth on the ground thats it  marisha caleb maybe save your shit for afterwards  liam also if i were to unlock it it would be loud so thats not good  taliesin can we put some light in there /none/ and maybe take a look at whats in there  sam whats in that room  taliesin yeah since we have an orb up dont we no we have a torch  matt yasha you have the torch right no caleb has the torch  taliesin caleb you want to use the torch to take a look in there maybe im keeping an eye through  this hallway and i think im going to slowly start scooting  matt start scooting this way  taliesin but against the wall  sam what an amazing mini  taliesin thank you  /none/ matt yeah these are the painted prototypes to give you a little bit of a glance of what these  will look like there are a few changes for the final designs of course but these will give you  an idea all righty theres molly on that side caleb as you hold the torch up at the bars and  look through make a perception check with advantage as youre following off notts lead and  its small chamber you can make out quite a bit of detail  liam oh thats good 19  matt good glancing inside /none/ you see that whatever scrape marks that mar the interior of this main  chamber there are none within this cell whatever this creature this gearkeeper construct is it  did not manage to breach these gates however on the opposite side you see three different bed  setups for prisoners some that seem either they were trying to claw their way out or the impact  of slamming on the other walls caused bits of it to fall in and collapse there are piles of stone  and fallen earth on the other side you see three skeletons they /none/ look like theyve been decomposing  for quite some time probably prisoners that couldnt escape and had no other way out  ashley thats sucks  sam thats rough  liam okay we can check this off our list probably there are some dead inmates in here  sam if the thing comes out here were all dead so we should probably figure out a way to stop it  taliesin we can all get in that room if we have to  sam all right but i cant open it  marisha normally you dont want to get trapped /dung/ in a room with something bigger and spinning with  12 blades i think wed be better off holding this choke point  taliesin thats the hope but we have these other options over here is there anything i can see  from my perspective from where im standing right now  matt make a perception check  taliesin i knew you’d say that thats a 16  matt your dark vision is 60 feet correct you can just make out the details of another interior  chamber looking within portions of the walls inside are also equally scraped apart /none/ edges of  the fine wellset stonework have been marred with repeated gashes all over it looks like beyond  that there was another prison cell but those bars have been breached as they are currently bent  gnarled and twisted and pulled out of place the cell beyond it appears to be open  marisha im going to move up and go to the opposite side of where molly is and peek down the  opposite way just like he did  matt anybody else moving anywhere  liam while people are moving around the room i whisper just /none/ for our options here if we want to  kick this off and dont mind getting its attention i can magically unlock this door here  which will make a sound and then instantly lock it if we wanted to we could all hustle inside  here and maybe attack at range just as an option  sam does the door have holes  matt the door is open but there are bars on this  sam thats not a door its just a cage  matt yes and its partially bent inward from the impact it looks like it /none/ sustained quite a bit of  brunt force to it over time  laim that would put beau and yasha at a disadvantage but the rest of us could take pot  shots at it from in here  marisha you know i like that idea maybe yasha and i can stand and hide and crouch in the corners  while you guys get its attention and shoot it from range what i would be afraid of is if we were all  in there and it eventually did what it did to those bars over there and busted in /none/ and we were  all sitting ducks on the inside  liam well i could be wrong but with what i know how to do i dont think it can do that to this  door for a short amount of time  marisha it looks like it  taliesin do you have a plan  liam well im talking about magic i can magically seal this door unless it has a way to  deal with that it will not be able to get through  sam thats pretty good lets move quickly though  matt make an intelligence /none/ check caleb if you dont mind  liam that is 15  matt 15 okay you were referring i believe to the spell arcane lock right  liam impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed  matt yep it can still be forced open its just a higher dc to do so its possible but it makes  it a much harder door to break through  liam okay  matt you have a valid point to what youre saying yes  marisha can i still complete my perception check and see if i see /none/ down here  matt go for it make a perception check  marisha not great seven  matt seven unfortunately even with your darkvision its hard to look past that way you  can see another chamber at your current vantage point its a little bit out of the way it looks  like theres not enough information youd have to get a little closer to make out the details  marisha is there anything that would warrant a couple people hiding while some people got in the  thing is there something that looks like yasha and i could /none/ maybe hide im a little disadvantage  looking at this angle  matt there are some piles of rubble and portions of the walls that have collapsed inwards  taliesin so you can get up and get a little height if you want and we can also  sam if we went inside that room though  taliesin those with range  sam the creature would probably give up and go back into hiding until we came out i would assume  taliesin maybe maybe not maybe it would keep pounding until you died  marisha you could still mage /none/ hand the tar between the bars right  sam sure  marisha lets try it  taliesin we dont even have to put the tar inside it could be outside  marisha thats what im saying caleb can you lift that gate spell if we need to get back out  liam yeah instantly  taliesin all right yasha were going to be on the outside then  ashley yep  sam thats scary and dangerous  taliesin this is scary and dangerous work  marisha wait are you and yasha going to be on the outside  taliesin well /none/ we dont have any range  marisha neither do i  taliesin youre going to be on the outside too i thought wed put all the ranged people in there  and draw its attention to attack them and then while its there we can all gang up on it  ashley three amigos  sam its a terrible idea but go for it  matt so what are you guys doing  marisha yeah lets do it  liam so you bruisers youre staying out here  marisha but were going to hide amongst this rubble on the opposite /none/ side and you guys are going to start  matt yasha where are you moving to  ashley were going to hide behind the rubble  matt right here  ashley and beau as well  matt beau youre moving over here as well  marisha yeah can i get up on top of the rubble and crouch down  taliesin im going to attempt to hide in the corner  matt its going to be hard to hide and climb it as well we can do about there as good as we can get there  taliesin oh yasha /none/ before i forget i got you something  ashley you did  taliesin i hand her one of the silk flowers from the festival it doesnt press well but you know  ashley it is going to be very special thank you molly  taliesin got for you if we live  matt molly are you staying there  taliesin yeah im going to stay super crouched  sam does jester have her spiritual weapon out  matt she doesnt yet  sam okay maybe we should get it ready  liam wait  sam wait what  liam i /none/ do not have the components i need for arcane lock damn it  marisha what do you need  liam a lot of gold dust  marisha a lot of gold dust  sam we can make some right now  marisha i know can we grind some gold really fast file some  sam quietly  marisha quietly file down gold coins  sam all right well plan b  ashley plan b thats fine  sam do you want me to scout ahead to the area that youve seen  taliesin or the cat  sam or the /none/ cat yes how about the cat goes to the area where molly has seen which liam for  you is the bottom left of the picture i sent you  matt so where are you sending frumpkin  liam into the last unexplored room  sam no this is the one that  taliesin the first unexplored room  sam the first explored room that molly has seen a little bit of  liam sorry i was looking at my spellbook and not paying attention to you lot what were you  hoping me to do  sam send the /none/ cat  taliesin sending the cat to take a look  marisha scout with the cat kitty scout  taliesin this may be the end of the cat  liam yeah okay im going to back as far away from that door as i can and i will send frumpkin in  matt moving back in the corner with beau and yasha right about there well say  liam ladies  matt you begin to focus and frumpkin heads to the right side of the fork into the chamber youve  already looked into towards the open cell doors that /none/ are currently pried off that archway as  frumpkin glances past make a stealth check for frumpkin  liam yep oh i dont have the cat paper with me in this state that im in because i didnt know  id be playing  matt thats okay  liam so i rolled a 15  matt rolled a 15 okay  liam yeah lets go with that  taliesin 15 plus cat  matt all right frumpkin glances inside this busted cell and sees what i’m using as an  interpretation of a large spherical metal object thats about eight /none/ feet diameter on any side it  looks like a series of overlapping metal plates that look clustered together at odd angles  elements of it look scraped and dented it looks like its been doing some serious damage to it  over time as it sits there resting and frumpkin approaches you watch one of the tiny little metal  plates squeak open a lens pokes out towards frumpkin withdraws back in the plate closes and  about six of these long bladelike spider legs stick out of it as it pulls back and begins to  roll forward /none/ at a very extreme pace  liam i snap frumpkin out of there  matt it rolls forward frumpkin just manages to bamf out of this dimension as the object slams  into the opposite wall you guys feel the entire chamber suddenly crash from the impact and you  hear this scraping of metal in the distance  sam im going to recast mage hand and pick up the bucket of tar  matt it rolls across the way and disappears into the other chamber  marisha im going to stealthily move forward back where i was across from /none/ molly  matt go ahead and make a stealth check please  marisha jesus christ this just got really  taliesin i have an interesting idea  matt nott where do you want to go  sam towards the narrower hallway  matt here  sam yeah just on the edge of it do i hear any movement or anything  matt you do hear the same object shifting on the other side  marisha 15  matt 15 okay  marisha oh no  matt nott as youre there at the edge and beaus there you glance in now /none/ that you guys are  close enough you can see shifting in there you pay attention and you can see this other chamber  is open with another cell off to the side it slams into that door spins around and one of the  lenses peeks around the corner right at where beau had just moved into the far corner  taliesin jester is going to cast her spiritual weapon and put it right in the center of  sam the room  taliesin yeah a big nice shiny object to distract  matt wheres fjord going because were /none/ about to go into combat  taliesin are we all pulling against the walls  marisha where is fjord going make fjord go by the gate maybe back a bit then beau is going to  take out those ball bearings  ashley can we put jester in the corner  matt jester can back up there  marisha lets not kill our friends’ dd characters  matt i need all of you to roll initiative  marisha if we still have a bit of an action im going to toss my bag of ball bearings and try and  /none/ throw a bunch of ball bearings right here  liam sam can you take a new picture and send it to me  matt you throw the ball bearings out clattering as that happens the legs which are still out  rear backward and they retract as it runs itself rolling forward in your direction ricocheting off  that wall the ball bearings as it grinds across the bottom get fired off like small impact  bullets from the grinding of the metal plates and the force of it hitting i need both nott and beau  to make dexterity /none/ saving throws  sam oh god save 21  matt 21  marisha oh wait not with advantage or no  matt not with advantage just a single roll  marisha okay 18 then  matt you guys both manage to just duck out of the way they dont seem to hit you its only a  handful of them that upon the impact of it hitting stone and being pressured beneath they shoot off  in your direction  marisha molly ball bearings didnt work rolling for initiative  matt initiative rolls guys roll for yourself beau and then /none/ roll for jester and fjord as well  taliesin ill roll for jester  marisha im rolling for fjord  matt 25 to 20  marisha hang on  taliesin so fucked  marisha sorry another persons character  matt 25 to 20 anybody 20 to 15  ashley 19  sam whoa who are you  ashley i don’t know but i dont know what to do this early on  taliesin its going to be a lot of dodging  matt 15 to ten  marisha fjord is 14 beau is ten  matt all right ten to /none/ five  sam seven  liam six  taliesin seven for me as well and jester is six  matt caleb and jester are in the same  sam caleb and jester are six molly and nott are both seven  matt seven got it top of the round as you see it come riding and curve around the corner and  slam into that wall the stone bends inward even further and bits of the masonry flake and fall off  to the ground clattering and small bits of stone it turns and you can see now the six /none/ spiderlike  blade legs sticking out of it six more shoot out of the top of it and all begin whirling around  and begin spinning there amongst this chaos you see the lens sitting right there just barely  peeking through its armored shell yasha youre up first  ashley okay i would like to rage  matt all righty  ashley its the time do i just go in  sam this is it  ashley can i get to it  matt counting you just barely get into its range with your barbarian speed you rush in /none/  anger on your face you draw your magicians judge blade in the air  ashley oh no  taliesin do you have advantage  ashley i didnt reckless 11  matt 11 unfortunately does not hit your blade scrapes across its armored exterior not finding  purchase in any of its innards  ashley divine fury can you do it on the first or only if the first  matt the first attack that hits  ashley that first attack that hits  matt correct  ashley can i use my extra attack  matt yeah you get that /none/ every round  ashley that’s better that’s 21  matt 21 hits roll damage  sam this is it  taliesin we’re so fucked  sam kick it in the ball  ashley okay 12  matt you roll 2d6 for the weapon 3d6 for the divine fury oh no it’s additional half your level  ashley yeah plus three it’s 2d6 plus three  matt 2d6 plus three right  ashley yeah so 12  matt 12 and then your rage damage which is two  ashley oh right yeah 14  taliesin is it divine fury still  /none/ ashley no because that’s only the first  matt well no it’s the first attack that hit that’s what i’m saying you get divine fury for  this hit because your first one hit this one does get it  ashley okay so an extra d6 oops okay an extra two so 16 total  matt okay with that  sam clang  matt the first strikes off the second one you bring down the blade carves down and one of its  metal arms bends off to the side the blade digs into the gears yasha’s blade finds its /none/ way in  sparks go streaking off and the blade gets jettisoned off you have to hold it before it gets  shot off the side of it the clockwork pushing it out of its innards the armor plate clicks over  and guards its space  ashley okay i’ll stay  taliesin did it lose a blade just now  matt it looks like it’s bent back a bit that ends yasha’s turn fjord is up next  sam yeah fjord  marisha fjord’s going to cast hex  taliesin hex ma’am  marisha i’m going to hex that /none/ robit  taliesin hex the robit  matt the robit is ahexed  marisha hang on wait that doesn’t no it doesn’t mess with armor of agathys just checking  matt you have a concentration on fjord for this  marisha this is hex then he’s going to take his falchion he’s going to flip it and from the  hilt he’s going to go firing he’s going to cast eldritch blast because i saw him do that once before  matt like a fromthehipshotgun i like it  marisha he did it before i’m ripping it off from travis /none/  matt that’s two shots fire twice  marisha pew pew 15 seven plus eight  matt seven plus eight 15 you fire the blast hits and disperses against the armor it does not hit  marisha right that magic shit he’s going to try it one more time that bounced okay that’s  better 13 plus seven  matt 20 20 does hit roll a d10 plus four plus another d6 for hex not a d4 plus four damage to  whatever you roll on the d10  marisha i’m sorry me don’t know how six sorry five plus /none/ four is nine damage  sam plus three from  marisha no that’s it i rolled a three and a two plus a four it’s not a lot of damage i rolled crappy  matt the second one does manage to pierce some of its armor within the interior of it there’s a  flash of green on the inside you see it curl around from the interior looking like cracks in  the armor are suddenly glowing and then no more that finishes fjord’s action and bonus action  marisha what did you roll to hit  ashley say /none/ again  marisha what did you roll to hit  ashley rolled a 21  marisha 21 so we know 20 hits  taliesin thank you  marisha now beauregard  matt is fjord going to stay where he is  marisha yes because i’m scared beau is going to  matt beau doesn’t go yet because it’s now the gearkeeper’s turn  marisha i’m sorry  matt that’s okay  marisha i didn’t know  matt that’s all right  sam the gearkeeper  matt beginning of its turn it’s going to attempt to roll over yasha to go /none/ into the chamber yasha  you need to make an athletics or acrobatics check  ashley okay okay okay  matt you’re raging so you have advantage on your acrobatics check  taliesin that athletics is already sweet though  ashley oof oh nine  matt no first off you suffer  ashley i rolled the wrong ones  matt seven points of piercing damage as it rolls over and the blades kick into you  ashley is that halved because i’m raging  matt it is halved an additional three points of bludgeoning damage as you are crushed beneath /none/ its  weight and you are knocked prone  ashley that’s a total of you said three and i’m sorry  matt it was seven before three so it’ll be ten halved so you take five points of damage  ashley five points of damage okay  matt it does roll past here stopping at this point it’d be about here i think as it spins in  this direction the things that drew its attention originally which is beau and nott in that corner  nott you do get an attack of opportunity with a melee weapon if you /none/ have one but you  have your crossbow out  sam i probably have my crossbow out  matt so yeah you don’t do much of an attack there  sam i’ll hit it with my crossbow  matt roll an attack improvised weapon for a melee  sam yeah 18  matt 18 just hits  marisha 18 is what hits y’all  sam do i get a point of damage  matt you get a point of damage on it  sam yeah eat it  matt your hand crossbow as you slam into it you look back /none/ and it looks like some of the wood is  splintered somewhat you’re like oh it’s not enough to the point where it looks like it’s not  going to function maybe but it’s going to need some repairs  sam i need a new crossbow is what i need  matt well there you go as it turns around the front of it where the lens is the lens retracts  in the plates in front suddenly open leaving this open black vacuous space like a mouth or a  gate opens in front you hear this very high /none/ whirring winding sound you see sparks inside  and a blast of heated shrapnel shoots outward in a 30 foot spray  sam it can do that  matt against both of you right there  sam cleff you madman  matt i need you both to make a dexterity saving throw please  sam oh rough 12  marisha that’s not too bad 22  matt success so you take half damage  marisha okay  matt that is 25 points of piercing damage to you nott  sam because i hit it with my thing do i no /none/ longer have a reaction  matt correct  sam oh shit  matt now you know about the reactions  ashley 25 points of damage  matt of piercing damage and halved for you so you take 12  marisha 12  matt its shrapnel blast is done that’s the end of its turn that brings us to beau you’re up  marisha okay being hit with hot shrapnel i’m going to do a cool pole vault over nott  matt over this way  marisha i guess wait where’s yasha yasha’s here  matt yasha’s prone on the ground /none/  marisha i’ll get on the other side of where yasha will eventually be  matt oh so around here  marisha uhhuh on this side of it  matt you’re moving into melee  marisha yep  matt got it  marisha then attack  matt go for it  marisha whack it with my stick i’m going to try and jam it up in between one of those gears  taliesin you also have the mouth you can throw the tar up in there  marisha that’s terrible that doesn’t hit that’s like ten  matt ten misses /none/ the first strike with your staff just scrapes off of its armor no impact  marisha i’m going to readjust and try and go for it again that’s the exact same roll those are  two twos in a row  matt the second one you strike again this time one of the blades swings outward and thankfully  the blade doesn’t hit the staff to cut the wood however it does the backhand impact it and  prevent the blow from actually striking its body  marisha two twos  matt that’s not fun  marisha i guess i /none/ will do an unarmed attack  matt you go and punch the armored sphere  marisha so frustrated that i can’t get my staff up there i’m just going to go and try and whack  it with my fist  matt go for it  marisha 17 which just misses  matt it just misses well not so much a miss you hit it but you go metallic clang oh you  can feel that from the knuckles right to the funny bone  marisha do i have any more movement  matt from there you have ten feet /none/  marisha can i back up towards or even get this i’m just going to stay where i am  matt okay finishing beau’s turn that brings us to nott and molly  marisha oh wait hang on as a bonus act no i used my bonus action fuck okay keep going  sam is its lens out  matt its lens appears to be out currently just surveying the scenario yes  sam so go for the lens  taliesin go for it  sam bonus action i will use the mage hand to deliver the tar right on /none/ that lens  matt i’ll say for the purposes of aiming on this with your intention go ahead and make a d20  attack roll adding your perception bonus  sam there is no bonus to that well that’s how do you feel about that well it fell so we’ll  never know what it was 17  matt 17 i’ll say for the purposes of that because it’s not armor you’re trying to strike  through it’s just trying to aim for a position that will be enough the tar with a toss  splashing all across the lens /none/ you see the sticky still warm thick tar spray onto it and  get inside the interior of its armor for the moment the lens starts swift movements and you  hear what previously was now that it’s close to you you can hear there’s hundreds and hundreds of  small clicks and winding sounds on the inside there’s now a rapid zipping movements as the  lens is trying to find some sort of direction it is currently blinded  cheering  sam our plan worked perfectly how far am i from the thing  matt technically you are /none/ ten feet from it  sam do you think i’m in melee range  taliesin probably  matt the blades have a bit of reach so you are technically in melee  taliesin that’s a tenfoot blade reach  sam can i use my action to disengage  matt you can use your action to disengage yeah disengage generally is an action  sam okay i will disengage and run  matt which direction  sam straight to the place i just came from  matt all right you can get there you can go one more if you want /none/ to  sam sure  matt all right there you go you can still keep it in your visual range but that’s 30 feet back  now you spin around with your crossbow not suffering any attack of opportunity all right molly  taliesin can i see anywhere where there seems to be a crack in the armor and make a  matt you may yes well you can try and inspect  taliesin i want to see if there’s anything that looks like a good target to start doing some  damage to  matt at the moment it /none/ hasn’t taken a lot of damage and it’s hard to see if any  taliesin is there a plate open or anything at the moment near me  matt the only plate that’s open is the one that has the lens visible but it’s really close to the  body and right now there’s blades spinning in its space  taliesin i’m going to try and get to the side without the blade i’m going to try and chop open  one of the plates on the back i’m going to start hacking away at it actually even with the /town/  blades there’s an open place right now is there a place for me to start poking the tender insides  matt at the moment not really it’s still fresh in battle and its armor plates are pretty much  protecting all of it  taliesin i’m going to try and find one armor plate and start going to town  matt where are you going to attack its construction  taliesin i want to get to its left hind quarters i’m going to run over to the opposite side flank  it with the lollipop  matt oh with /none/ the lollipop all righty you’re going to be right there on top of the door  taliesin mmhmm  matt all righty take your attacks  taliesin first attack is a natural 20  matt nice make your damage on that and roll the second attack that’s  taliesin 2d6 with ice damage that’s counting 17 points of damage  matt 17 points of damage nice  taliesin next attack with the same sword actually i’m so sorry that’s the wrong sword  that’s 18 points of damage because of the summer’s dance  matt correct  taliesin then the /none/ next one summer’s dance again is not quite as good 12 that does not hit  matt 12 does not but first strike carves through and some of the armor bends inward as you cut  through plates bend inward and have to try and retract to protect but they’re locked in place  you’ve actually bent them to the point where they cannot reform this armored mesh it’s trying to  correct itself but busted in place the second strike as you come down one of the blades  catches and parries it off to the side no impact /none/ on the second blow  taliesin okay going for a third strike  matt go for it  taliesin 14  matt 14 does not hit this is a tough mother you go to strike a third time you do hit but it just  doesn’t cut through the blade shakes a bit you pull back cursing yourself  taliesin is it worth seeing if it’s going to well it’s blinded so it’s got disadvantage if it  tries to even hit me with an attack so i’m going to try and back off and climb up that little hill /none/  matt for those questioning even though it is blinded it lowers its attack because some people  are like attacking things with blindness have advantage because it is nothing but a spinning  whirring of blades and technically it has multiple forms of sight it is not granting  advantage on the attacks against it  taliesin i’m going to try and hop up that hill really quickly  matt all righty you try and move this way  taliesin yep  matt all right you’re hopping up this edge  taliesin as high as i can get to /none/ get out of its range  matt okay so that will be probably over here best you can for this  taliesin yeah right over there is good  matt you manage to scoot yourself up to that side and climb away it does swing out towards you it  does have disadvantage on the attack because of the blindness that will bring it to a 13 to hit  taliesin that does not hit  matt you manage to duck out of the way  taliesin and now it doesnt have a reaction anymore  sam ooh nice  /none/ matt that ends your turn there that brings us to caleb and jester  liam no audio  sam and taliesin we cant hear you  sam why cant we hear you  marisha yeah we can hear you now oh wait do it again  liam can you hear me right now  all yes  liam yeah okay ill go but i cant see the map is a pixelated mess of shit from my point of view  after mollymauk cleared the way is the thing on its own is it in a 40foot cube of empty space /none/ or  are any of my allies in it  matt no it is surrounded theres beau to one part of it its about ten feet from yasha and  about 15 feet from molly  marisha its a pretty tight box were in  taliesin were in a tight box  liam slow is out the window i pull out my clay cats paw and mutter a few words and i will cast  maximilians earthen grasp a soil cats paw comes up out of the ground and swipes it needs to make  a strength save 16  /none/ matt strength save that is a 15 what is your dc  liam 16 its held in place and it takes 2d6 damage hold on it takes five points of  bludgeoning damage  matt five points of damage got it it is held in place  liam it has to use an action to break out  matt that it does that ends your turn caleb are you going to stay back in the corner where you are  liam if i can squish even one square further away from it i would  matt you are backed up /none/ into the current corner as far away as you can get that ends calebs  turn jesters up what are you guys doing with jester  taliesin first off were going to have the spiritual weapon take a swipe right at where the  plates are already broken and hit it again which is a bonus action and a plus seven to hit oh  thats not it its around here somewhere there it is thats a 15  matt that was 15 to hit  taliesin wait wait counting yeah 15  matt that does not hit the lollipop /none/ swings down and then bounces down off the armor the spiritual  weapon is not able to penetrate its armored hide thats your bonus action jester still has an action  taliesin i dont think this is going to do anything  marisha singing playing with your friends dd characters  taliesin i was thinking of trying maybe a  sam simple sacred flame  taliesin we could do sacred flame or if you were nearer id say cure wounds or we could do a  guiding bolt  ashley hey thats a classic  taliesin like jester were going /none/ to do guiding bolt you roll this one  sam imitating taliesin were going to do guiding bolt  ashley thats a 26  matt 26 definitely hits roll damage on that  taliesin thats 4d6 radiant damage  matt yes and the next attack on it has advantage  ashley okay come on jester any pluses  taliesin no just 4d6  ashley 14  matt 14 points of damage nice as the released guiding bolt slams into the side of it the blast  of divine energy explodes some of the plates dent inward and now you see /none/ this glittering energy  thats entwining its body giving you a glimmer of some of the weak points to help you hit where  itll hurt the most does that finish jesters turn she going to stay where she is or is she  going to move  taliesin i feel like we should open up a little bit i think shes going to see if she can crawl  over to the door so she can hide behind it in case something bad happens  matt okay so she tries to move into the doorway  sam that door /none/ actually opens and closes matt  taliesin in fact she might be smart she has to keep the spiritual weapon in visual range right  matt yeah  taliesin okay shes going to just use that as some cover  matt sounds good so that finishes jesters turn top of the round yasha  ashley okay so im going to stuttering pick myself up  matt thats half your movement so you still have 20 feet of movement  ashley can i flank get around so beau and i are yeah  matt right there you are now flanking with /none/ beau your first attack has advantage anyway because of  the guiding bolt  ashley right thats right  sam up the butt does it have a butt matt  matt you cannot discern any sort of rear end or exhaust port  sam does it poop  matt youll find out im sure  ashley 22  matt 22 hits roll damage on that first strike  taliesin thats a lot  sam everyone poops  marisha we cant see the sphincter  taliesin oh wait no everybody poops unless theyre an android because then they must be destroyed /none/  marisha oh yeah sure thats right  taliesin poop poop  ashley 16  matt 16 points of damage cutting through bits and pieces of it nice thats your first strike  on it as you jam down grinding off some of the metal plates pull away from it and once again  lock unable to push back into place theres small places where youre starting to buckle parts  of its exterior armor so its ac actually does go down by one  sam ooh  ashley oh okay so i get another attack  matt thats your /none/ first strike you get a second attack  taliesin so we now know at least a 17 will hit  ashley that does not have advantage right  matt you do because youre currently flanking with beau  marisha singing because were flanking bitch  ashley thats a 25  matt 25 does hit roll damage  ashley not an extra because not divine fury  matt correct just 2d6 plus five  ashley okay thats 11  matt 11 points of damage nice yasha busting it out all right that finish your turn  liam just a reminder that /none/ everyone is rolling at advantage while the cats paw holds it  all ooh  matt oh because its restrained right  taliesin blinded and restrained right now  matt good to know that finishes yashas turn its now fjords go  marisha exaggerated texan drawl i do a cowboy saunter up behind the i go under the lollipop  and i use the magical field of the lollipop to make it like me walking through a glitter fog  machine i walk up to him thank you i walk up and im going to attack with my falchion  /none/ matt go for it make two strikes with the falchion first attack with advantage  marisha im sorry travis  sam thats exactly how he talks  marisha ill take that 18 plus that seven  matt all right that hits the first attack thats a d8 plus  marisha plus hex  matt a d8 plus four plus hex  marisha and then im going do booming blade with my action is that not how this works  matt no  marisha okay no im going to do damage  matt booming blade is a cantrip that only gives /none/ you one attack as part of the action  marisha never mind then im just going to hit it real hard  matt thats okay  marisha six plus two plus five so eight plus five  matt all right thats 13 damage  marisha see my math i can only do half im so tired  matt its been a long day i know fjord comes up holding the falchion hand swings down carving  through the shadows of the hex helping the blade dig in that much more you have a second attack  marisha okay its still /none/ advantage right  matt yep  marisha yeah hyuck hyuck hyuck ill take that 16  liam meanwhile travis is somewhere singing dear theodosia  marisha yeah somewhere hes getting a nosebleed while this happens four plus four plus five so 13  matt 13 points of damage that hits again with that with fjord carving into it twice with the  blade each time the falchion is carving through each section more and more armored pieces are  pushing inward its not enough to lower its ac but it is taking more and more damage slowly  youre piercing /none/ its heavily protected exterior  marisha do i have any more movement  matt fjord would have yeah  marisha like ten more  matt ten more feet  marisha hes going to back up to that gate a little bit  matt one or two steps  marisha two if he can  matt all right still in melee  marisha hes still in melee okay  matt its a ten foot range that ends your turn  marisha yep thats fjords turn  matt all right that brings us to the gatekeeper construct the lens has retracted back /none/ into its  armor and you hear this sound whirring the lens comes out and it has cleared the tar from its lens  marisha cleff you sick bastard  ashley damn it so he did think of that he put that in his notes  marisha he did yeah he said he didnt have a failsafe that lying old bastard  ashley lying sack of shit  matt the lens retracts and pops out the back side immediately scanning the source of whats  currently clutching it and its dirtdriven arcane paw the blade arms on the top retract /none/ in and  instead these two heavy iron spears lock into place and both go firing outward towards caleb  sam oh no not my sweet boy  matt they have disadvantage because it is restrained with disadvantage its going to be an  18 to hit for the first one  liam shield  matt all right  liam so it misses  matt all righty second one 16 and 18 16 plus eight its going to be 24  liam oh that will hit those will hit  matt the first one the shield clang it ricochets off /none/ and floats off in the background  spinning the second one however pierces through the shield and hits you in the chest  liam thats not going to be good  matt thats going to be 17 points of piercing damage  liam good good good  matt and you are pinned to the wall it actually pierced through your chest and is now holding you  into the stone your movement is zero and you are considered restrained against the wall  liam i also have to make a concentration check  matt you do so go ahead and /none/ make a constitution check with the damage taken it has to be at  least a ten or higher  liam hold on i rolled a three  matt no and with that the paw is broken  sam cat yowl  marisha shit  liam well its still there its just not holding it wait no its gone  matt no its gone you’ve lost concentration on the spell and it did recharge its shrapnel blast  marisha i was really wanting advantage on all my attacks oh but i have yasha flanking okay  matt that being the /none/ case that’s going to finish its turn its going to stay put because the  blades now grind out again and begin whirring and spinning around its orblike body that brings us  to beau beau at the top of your turn because you are within five feet of it you automatically  take whirling blade damage by being in proximity  liam matt was that 17 points of damage  matt that was yes  ashley im also in proximity  matt yes so at the top of your turn youll take it as well thats six points of /none/ slashing damage  to you beau now take your turn  marisha six apply changes singing dd beyond  sam my mustache is falling off so i better hold it on with another mustache  taliesin no stop  matt fuck you sam  marisha okay im having internet problems view okay i get advantage on this attack right  matt you do because youre flanking  marisha okay im going to try and once again get up in those plates  sam get up under them plates  marisha that ones cocked underneath okay  matt a four and /none/ a six  marisha no it was cocked underneath it was tilted  matt okay that dice is weird for that because then you rolled the d20 twice  marisha then i wont use it  matt all right so roll the second one  marisha okay 17 plus seven  matt for the second strike  marisha i rolled both at the same no first to strike  matt the first roll you had was a four on the top so roll for your second die  marisha okay  matt just keeping it kosher  marisha okay its /none/ still an 18  matt 18 hits yeah go ahead and make your strike with your staff  marisha okay four  matt four points of damage  marisha plus another four  matt so thats eight as your staff strikes across it the wood of it while damaging doesnt  seem to be having as strong an impact as you’d hope against its armored form  marisha because its not magical  matt it seems to be resistant to something that is not magical  sam oh no  marisha even though i still hit can i try to /none/ stun it with a stunning strike  matt sure lets go ahead and im pretty sure  marisha i havent hit anything in so long and i just want to stun something ive had such bad  luck the past two fights  matt im so sorry  marisha i havent been such a good monk  liam yeah coughing thats rough buddy  sam so far weve learned today that fjord sounds like this goofy chuckling  matt by the rules as written because it mentions the ki of the inside of the body there is no ki  /none/ but there is a magical core ill say that when you strike the body intending to stun it while  youre not affecting the ki of a soul the ki that youre expending might interfere with its central  energy core so it has to make a constitution saving throw  marisha okay  matt thats going to be a 17 whats the dc  marisha yeah  matt its a 12 plus five im sorry  marisha yeah it saves  matt you have another attack  marisha im going to do that still have advantage right  matt /none/ you do  marisha man it will be really awesome when that monk ability thats core of my class actually  works 17 plus seven  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage for that second strike with your staff  marisha six  matt all right six  marisha plus another four so ten total sorry  matt it takes five points of damage as the second strike is still somewhat deflected by the  armor of its body  marisha since i have two hits can i do extract aspects spend a ki point  matt you /none/ can you spend a ki point since weve changed or errataed it it does not make a saving  throw you just get to learn  marisha i get to learn two things now  matt at level six you get to learn two things  marisha can i learn its lowest saving throw ability  matt the lowest saving throw ability it has would be charisma  laughter  sam useless  matt not against some spells  marisha hey molly you want to mock this asshole to death  taliesin i think it would still go poorly but /none/ lets see if it comes to it  marisha okay im going to take my last attack  matt okay go for it  marisha still at advantage right  matt yep  marisha okay i hit with a 15 plus seven so a 22  matt that hits  marisha i have a d6 now five damage  matt five damage reduced to two this time you hit with your fists again it scrapes through the  armor and youre bleeding at the knuckles from the impact its hard to break through its shell  marisha im feeling so /none/ useful you guys  matt this is a rough fight for a monk at level five unfortunately  taliesin i got a crazy idea  matt that finish your turn beau  marisha yeah im going to stay exactly where i am  matt okay that finishes beaus turn nott and molly youre up  taliesin you first please  sam im going to scoot around and fire a crossbow at it  matt go for it  sam thats a 15 plus seven to hit  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  sam is it within /none/ melee and stuff  matt it is  sam well that wasnt good at all  taliesin hey beau  sam thats eight  matt eight points of damage reduce that in half because its a nonmagical source thats four  points of piercing to it  sam ill use my fury of the small thats another five points  marisha are you using my friends success to try and make me feel better  taliesin no he actually only did four points of damage sam only did four  marisha oh youre trying to use my friends failure to /none/ make me feel better  matt it gets stuck in some of the gears you see some sparks from the inside but it doesnt fully  pierce its shell  sam terrible i cant really do anything you know what ill take out my last burning bolt  that should be magical load it up and fire that  matt go for it that is a magical bolt  sam but that doesnt hit i just wasted it its 14  matt the bolt doesnt impact it just glides off the armor it lands somewhere in the distance you  /none/ dont know if its retrievable or not yet  sam damn it  marisha its impossible to take you seriously  sam what are you talking about  taliesin i cant even im rooting for nott then i look at you and i feel weird  matt molly youre up  sam im going to duck back a little bit  taliesin im going to run in and try to do a little bit more damage in here im coming in and  taking three more shots i caught it its all good that one misses  matt all right /none/ you move in go for it  taliesin that one hits thats a 19  matt first strike it dodges it moves out of the way the second strike actually makes an impact  so roll for that  taliesin thats okay counting thats 12 points of damage  matt 12 points of damage all righty carves through with the second strike  taliesin for a third slightly less exciting attack natural 20  matt this is your offhand so its not a magical weapon  taliesin but its magicked up  matt correct so the extra rite damage is /none/ magical but the actual blade will be halved  taliesin okay thats fine  matt so roll the d6 for your blade  taliesin thats two to three so thats five  matt five reduced to two so two damage plus this doubled well no sorry the two is doubled  because it was a crit so it would have been four plus three which is seven  taliesin so it was a five  matt sure its five damage  taliesin and then six because this is doubled  matt so 11 points of damage now the armor is /none/ reduced to 16 as youre carving away at its  armored shell its starting to look pretty hurt you see it shifting rapidly trying to figure out  its situation and tactically maneuver best it can  taliesin im going to see if i can hop back up out of am i ever getting out of melee or am i  not getting out of melee  matt if you back all the way up to here you can or all the way up to the top  taliesin it will still get an attack of opportunity on me though /none/ without disadvantage now  matt at the moment no  taliesin you know im going to stick around for now  matt okay  taliesin im going to keep a flanking point i’m going to move a little bit so that we’re spread  out around it so it has to make some decisions  sam can he use the rest of his movement to work on his jester accent  matt sure  taliesin thats going to be a lot of movement  matt caleb and jester youre up next caleb youre currently pinned to the wall youre muted /none/  also i cant hear you  liam what comes after jester and i in the initiative order  matt yasha does  liam yasha does and then the thing  matt yes yasha fjord and then the thing  marisha and jester is with you  liam yeah i know im having trouble thinking straight because there is a blade through my gut  and my rib cage so i grasp the cats paw again i dont try to pull myself loose and i cast  maximilians earthen paw again strength save  matt as the paw reaches out /none/ once more to grab it that is a 19 14 plus five sorry man  youre still maintaining concentration but it did not seem to grasp it at this moment all right  that ends calebs turn jesters up  marisha no dont do that go back sorry keep going  taliesin should i try something offensive or healingbased do you think how are you doing caleb  liam bad  taliesin okay so were going to do this were going to run out and cast healing word on caleb  matt okay so step back through the door a /none/ little bit there what level  taliesin level one  matt so a d4 plus four to caleb  taliesin yes 1d4 plus four so thats seven points  matt caleb you heal seven points thats a bonus action from jester whats next you can only use  a cantrip since youve cast a bonus action spell  ashley so the spiritual weapon  matt spiritual weapon is a bonus action spell youve already used the healing word unfortunately  taliesin but i can use my action for the bonus action  matt it doesnt work that way  taliesin /none/ you cant up a bonus action to an action  matt no  taliesin man so i cant cast anything higher than level one either can i  matt or a cantrip  taliesin i can only cast cantrip at this point i would have done that in the reverse order if i had  been thinking about things well what do i got i got a oh  matt but calebs healed a little bit  taliesin calebs healed and thats good do we want to try  ashley yeah i say give it a go  taliesin lets /none/ try toll the dead  matt constitution saving throw  taliesin its a wisdom saving throw  matt wisdom to toll the dead  taliesin you point at one creature you can see within range and the sound of a you succeed at  a wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 of necrotic  matt it is wisdom you are right so that would put it at a 14 because it has no wisdom modifier  ashley 15  matt 15 so it takes the damage go ahead and roll  taliesin if the target is missing any of its /none/ hit points it instead takes 1d12 necrotic damage  matt youre level five so it technically  sam jester voice technically  matt its a 5thlevel character so its  matt and taliesin 2d12  taliesin all right thats 17 points of necrotic damage  matt not bad for a cantrip  taliesin boom  matt its not too bad all right thats going to finish jesters turn does she want to move  taliesin i think shes going to back up again  matt back into the door you got it jester is just on the side there all /none/ right finishes  jesters go yasha youre up  ashley okay i am going to attack with my  matt at the top of your turn you take blade damage because youre in proximity to it thats  ten you take ten points of piercing damage so reduced to five  taliesin youre a beast youre great  ashley all right so question i would like to try to use the dispel magic portion of my  magicians judge  sam now  ashley i dont know is that bad  sam i dont know can you get in there /none/ is the guts exposed  taliesin is there enough gut to hit  matt there are a couple of pockets where you can see inside of it but you dont see the power  source its risky  ashley okay im going to wait  matt so youre just taking a strike with it you have advantage because youre flanked with beau  marisha i think thats the best thing ive done this whole fight is flanking  matt some fights arent great for every class im sorry  ashley 19  matt 19 hits roll damage  taliesin 16 /none/ to hit so thats not bad  matt yep 16 ac  ashley okay 17 points  matt 17 points carving past with the blade you have a second strike if youd like  ashley i would like does that also have advantage or no  matt yeah it is because youre flanking  ashley okay ooh 22  matt yeah that hits roll damage again  ashley 16  matt 33 points of damage in one round yasha doesnt mess around that finishes your turn  ashley yes  matt fjords up  marisha okay fjord is going to /none/ walk up im a warlock first hes going to do i dont think  this is a concentration thing its a bonus action hes going to do hexblades curse  matt correct you can do that  sam its pronounced  sam marisha and taliesin exaggerated texas drawl hexblades curse  taliesin so much fun to make fun of him when hes not here i think at some point you may need  another mustache  marisha i gain a bonus to damage rolls that equals my proficiency modifier  matt so an additional three damage per strike  marisha /none/ an additional three damage i should have done this forever ago  matt yeah but now you know  marisha im not a warlock first attack still with advantage right  matt no youre not flanking with anybody  marisha oh hes not its just yasha and i  matt so first attack with the falchion  marisha plus seven  matt thats two attacks there  marisha oh wait sorry but ill take it those first two attacks 17 and 14  matt yeah both will hit so roll damage on each so a d8 plus  marisha d8 /none/ plus six  matt d8 plus seven on each attack plus a d6 on each so roll that  marisha six plus seven so 13 on the first one same 13 on the second one  matt nice starting to look pretty rough now as parts of it are breaking down a bit its shaking  and you see little sparks on the inside as gears are starting to connect where they’re not supposed  to and grind against each other that finish fjords turn  marisha yeah can he back up again  matt five feet or ten  /none/ marisha ten  matt one more and it’ll take an attack of opportunity up to you  marisha if he does an attack of opportunity if i move fjord back than we get a sentinel strike right  matt technically if he takes it  marisha yeah lets do it sorry fjord he hasnt taken any damage step back he still has  armor of agathys too  taliesin step all the way back might as well because you can always run back there  marisha i think thats as far as he can go movement speedwise  matt no /none/ he can move farther than that  marisha sure  matt okay its not going to take an attack of opportunity its currently focused on everything  else around it  marisha what okay  matt that finishes fjords turn  marisha yes it does  matt this entity is going to attempt to shift back this way which means beau and molly both get  attacks of

action it is locked in place and it cant move its speed is zero frustratingly  caleb i need you to make another concentration check please from the damage you took  liam on what nothings up  matt /none/ i thought your other cat hand  liam that failed last time didnt it  matt it failed but can you still try it for every turn after or is it a onetime cast thing  liam it can use a strength save to break out of it and it exists but if i fail my concentration  check it goes right  matt but youve recast it  liam the second time it succeeded immediately  matt right but when you create it in space it stays there  liam it stays there  matt yeah and then as /none/ an action you can cause it to try and do things  liam great then that means its staying there  matt make a concentration check to see if you maintain the spell  liam yes sir  matt higher than a ten  liam 12  matt all right you succeed you maintain concentration that finishes your turn beau  youre up first  sam do that thing

blades carving into your nowunconscious body nearby  marisha do i roll again can i take the roll i just used  matt yeah whatever you rolled on your death saving throw  marisha 14  matt yeah so thats a failure and a success that brings us to nott and molly  taliesin you want to go first  sam sure  taliesin got any thoughts  sam i mean i dont have much ill walk up there poke around the corner shoot a crossbow  bolt do my /none/ thing thats a big hit 25  matt thatll do roll damage with sneak attack  marisha should have brought more tar  sam ten halved  matt five points of piercing damage on the

blades spin around and you take eight points of slashing damage its your turn  taliesin counting eight points of slashing damage oof thats rough im going to take two  swipes at im going to try and move im going to try and move somewhere where im flanking is  there any flanking available at the moment  matt at the moment for you if you move over beaus body its a tough call i mean ill let  you /none/ do it if you want to youll have to be standing over her unconscious body  taliesin i was about to say is it in any way that going to give her a little cover at the very  least  matt probably not  taliesin ill move in and then move around well no goddamn it  matt its up to you  taliesin im going to take a couple shots and see how this goes  matt go for it take those shots molly  taliesin

 matt yep roll damage on this one  taliesin counting thats ten points of damage  matt ten points of damage how do you want to do this the blades are /none/ spinning grinding around  taliesin ive got that one really soft blade and im rolling it and i want to see that one little  opening and i want it to bend the sword bends and does that chinese martial art thing where it goes  and pops all the way into the center of it and i go wrist deep into the thing  matt the edges of the armor scrape against your flesh pushing and cutting past skin causing  blood to drip down your arm but this is a natural state for you as the arm pushes /dung/ into the center  theres a flash of blue light and the interior of its armored shell electricity crackling its  like a glow on the inside of a cracked dark orb as all the individual sections where the plate  armors meet suddenly glow with a bright vibrant bluewhite light and then go dark and the whole  metal object hits the ground all the legs go limp and it rolls a little bit to one side now  inert and no longer functioning as a construct  liam that was a chow yunfat moment  taliesin i got /none/ a new die baby does it look familiar motherfucker  sam is it the snitch  taliesin its the negasnitch  matt the negasnitch  sam where did you get that  taliesin i found the place where the snitch came from i had the woman make me one out of iron  matt i love it  taliesin boom motherfucker  matt well see how it fares  taliesin its been middly but its done okay today  sam ecks versus sever  taliesin gil has been a help today  matt all righty you all take a moment /none/ beau is bleeding out  taliesin oh no were immediately going to help  matt jester runs up  ashley jester runs up and casts cure wounds  sam does she have a cure wounds  taliesin yeah we got 1stlevel lay on hands to get her up  ashley at 1stlevel because i feel like thats what she would do  marisha you really get tired of this dying thing i guess unconscious thing  taliesin you did so well no really you did some good stuff in there you kept it sitting  liam yasha  ashley yeah /none/  liam could you please come cast pull this lamppost out of my stomach  ashley oh yes yes i go over and i here  matt yasha puts her foot up on the wall and with one big yank pulls it out of your torso caleb  it was about two inches from the side of your body and thrust through your abdomen you begin to  bleed but jester comes over and helps close up that wound before you bleed out too much further  sam im going to run back and see what was back over there /none/  taliesin yeah i want to take a look in the other room too and give them a proper look  matt glancing into the chamber that is another closed gate that is bent inward from the repeated  slamming of this centurion trying to make its way in looking past the inside you see four  decomposed bodies  sam can i open the thing  matt make an attempt to do so  taliesin liam you get ten hit points and you get 12  marisha dope  liam who gets what now  taliesin you get ten /none/  marisha i get 12  sam 13  liam from jester  taliesin from jester  matt these prison locks are a pain in the butt you havent encountered something quite so heavily  fortified as these cells  sam caleb i need you to come open this door  taliesin im going to walk over to the door and start beating it with a sword  matt okay make a strength check  taliesin you cant dex cut this thing you cant pop it in  matt no you have to force it  sam yasha i need /none/ you to come kick in this door  ashley if this big thing couldnt kick it in how could i  liam im coming  sam youre bigger  taliesin eight  matt it is not budging  sam youre bigger in spirit and heart  ashley okay ill come and try to open the door  matt you go over see where molly has failed and you go and try to fill that void make a strength check  sam i believe in you oh wait  ashley what  taliesin no go ahead  ashley its not going /none/ to budge  sam im going to use this matt im going to try to bend fate and try to repick the lock  matt okay its a little late but ill allow it sure  sam i know  matt why not go for it  sam its a lot  laughter  sam its 26  matt 26 okay as yasha comes forward and slams her foot into it it jostles the lock just enough  for you to slip past the tumblers and with a creaks it opens a few inches on the inside the  bottom /none/ of it is scraping against the stonework the way its been bashed and bent has actually  forced it out of the frame of the door and its going to take a bit more force to push it open  enough to move inside but you manage to do so  taliesin the three of us will get that door open  liam caleb stops midsomatic gesture and says ah fuck this and goes back to the first door  and has a short rest  matt okay  marisha yeah beau is going to deliriously still really messed up /tavern/ like a drunk person doing  a pointless task is going to try and scoop up some ball bearings that she threw and then after  maybe she picks up like ten  matt make an investigation check  marisha okay  liam eins zwei drei vier  marisha 12  matt how many ball bearings did you throw out  marisha i tossed my baggie  matt your entire bag  marisha my pouch and did one of these things so im going to get my pouch back and then  matt okay you get your pouch back and /none/ you manage to scoop up you have well say 814 ball bearings  marisha okay  matt laughs most of which because its such a ridiculous item  marisha then after i deliriously tired of scooping up ball bearings im going to stumble  back and collapse next to caleb and also take a short rest  matt okay  ashley may i go over and see the room where this thing was staying in on the other side  matt sure so you make your way to the opposite end  sam anything near the bodies  matt make /none/ an investigation check  sam this im good at one  laughter  matt you find at first you think its dried compost but you eventually realize no its just  very old human excrement  marisha ooh  taliesin at some point well cast detect magic  matt you found prison poop  sam old prison poop  matt yes yasha you head off to the other side where the gate is open and as you go inside you  can see the interior of this chamber is as scraped up as the rest of them from where this /none/ sentry was  attempting to scan and break out on the inside make an investigation check first time for you  ashley i think it is 11  matt 11 okay looking around on the inside you take a glance and there are these little pieces  of things everywhere some hard some soft and you start pulling it up and you notice that a lot  of these are tiny torn slivers of blanket or sheet or pillow and the other hard pieces are tiny  shards of bone whatever prisoners who were in here who could not keep /dung/ this at bay their remains  have been time and time again ground battered and destroyed by this creature as it ran through  it has torn apart their bedding and their bodies but beyond that nothing else of interest  liam back at the front gate leaning against beauregard eh what is that is that your blood  or is that mine  marisha slurring i dont know it might be yours its hard to tell  liam snoring  matt fjord pats you on the shoulder next to you and goes hey i just wanted to let you /none/ know i  appreciate what you did taking the brunt of it because it didnt even hurt me  marisha slurring thats very true im going to remember that next time  matt and thats because of you  marisha slurring youre the best fjord  matt i know all righty so what else are you guys doing  sam should we retrieve the magic core or anything as proof of what we did here  taliesin i mean the fact that were going to leave the door open and its not coming up but  yeah well go get /none/ the core and i figure were going to do a thorough investigation of the whole  thing once caleb can do a detect magic  matt okay while calebs taking a moment to finish his short rest you begin to peer inside  and pull back some of the loosened armor plates now that the machine is open theres not tension  holding it together and you see that each of these armored plates on the inside are attached  to its own armlike pole once it collapsed all the armor plates went limp and fell open its a  /none/ tensionheld bit of armor that it could expand and push out different areas to leave openings and  then retract again its a pretty ingenious design and you can see why tinkertop is a  talented man though flawed sometimes in his designs this is pretty revolutionary  taliesin its like a weaponized version of one of those balls that you throw up in the air and it  turns inside out  matt similar to that i guess you could say looking inside its hundreds of these little  poles and gears and little servos and a lot of /none/ them are ground bent and damaged from the impact  that you left inside there in the center you see a cracked open and partially destroyed bluish  crystal sphere that was where your final blow impacted to destroy it  taliesin im going to keep cutting off the arms so we can get to it  matt its yanking and bending pieces pulling them out and pinging on the inside with the  damage youve done its not too hard to pry a few off but you manage to get to it and there is the  cracked and /none/ shattered crystal core  ashley couple questions i really like some of the armor pieces that he has on his shoulders  like with the skulls and things is that just part of his  matt thats just part of the miniature that was my representation for it i did not have a mini of  a spherical ball made of armor im sorry thats the best i could do for size and intimidation  ive been very busy didnt have time to make an entire mini of a tiny spherical metal ball covered  in blades  taliesin what /none/ could you have possibly have been doing matt sorry  matt sorry no its fine  marisha your mustache is traveling  sam wherever it stays well lets take this stuff back up to the warden  taliesin weve had a short rest and well do a quick search can you do a detect magic spell caleb  liam yeah i have a little bit left in me mollymauk will you help me up please  taliesin oh yeah come on thats all right  marisha no hes my pillow fuck you molly  taliesin go fuck yourself beau come /none/ on  liam grunting okay point me at the thing  matt you do a scan of detect magic through the room over the next 15 minutes or so you do a  thorough pass around nothing magical catches your attention most of the interior here is  actually no thats not true very faint magical auras from two ember light torches that are on the  wall that faint red light that youve seen is essentially a very low light everburning torch  liam i turn to mollymauk and say yeah the only thing magical here is you friend /none/ pat pat on the  cheek i wander back over to beauregard and i go to sleep again  taliesin all right come on were going to get you guys out of here strained were going to go  marisha groaning okay  matt you pick yourselves up and make your way back to the heavy metal door on this side you  can see the heavy scraping across it as this ball has also been pushing repeatedly into this one  exit point as you approach it is still closed and presumably locked  sam knocking were done let /none/ us out guards  matt you hear some shifting behind it and eventually hear the familiar grinding of chains  against metal creaking it opens slightly and the guards peer out you alive  taliesin i hold up the glowing crystal you should see the other one laughs  matt go check it out a few of the gnomish guards push past and head down another one of the  gnomish guards goes well fucking a is it done the other gnomes rush past him and say  sure enough they killed the thing hes like oh all right ill /none/ lead you back to our boss  come on follow me  marisha beauregard goes i just it took a lot out of us i pass out in yashas arms  ashley okay  marisha yasha  taliesin do i buy this  marisha you have to carry me  ashley i got you  matt fireman carries you  taliesin i want to have an insight versus deception check on you  matt make an insight check  taliesin all right i ain’t going to mess with you i just want to know nope thats an eight  unless /none/ you roll really poorly  ashley as im holding her  marisha i rolled way better  ashley i will cast healing hands  matt okay go ahead and roll for that  ashley regain number of hit points equal to your level so you gain an extra five hit points  marisha you make me feel so warm inside  taliesin come on nott  marisha how many hit points  matt five  ashley a whole five  sam on our way out do i see my bolt anywhere  matt make an investigation check as you glance /none/ around the space  sam 12  matt because its a small space you do manage to recover it so you get one bolt back it did not trigger  sam it only triggers if it hits  matt if it hits an intended target possibly or something hard enough you rolled low enough where  it didnt seem to truly impact  liam make a fumanchu check  matt you guys slowly make your way guided back by the various guards of the gearhold prison to  the office of the wardenhelm where both rissa and her father are /none/ waiting as they walk in you  glance over and can see cleff he’s like so howd it go any luck with the thing oh you  broke it  taliesin we did we may need that later sadly  matt im simultaneously impressed and kind of sad but impressed mostly  taliesin it did work us over quite well  sam it was an incredible device  ashley it really was  sam you could have told us the eye had a protective windshield wiper device  matt its more for when its raining i didnt think it would /none/ be for tar but good to know he  takes out the note in his little pad  taliesin im going to take the crystal back im so sorry we may need this  matt at this point you see turning in the office vicinity wardenhelm poppin turns and goes it  appears my guards say you are successful in this that is very good i am impressed what is your  names if i might be of curious  marisha were the mighty nein  matt the mighty nein all right good to know that the mighty nein can /town/ be relied upon in such  situations are you staying in town for quite a while  marisha i dont know how long we might be staying in town so maybe we should go ahead and talk  about that deal while were here  matt right while you were down there i got approval for about 200 gold from the starosta for  payment i hope that is enough  marisha to get out the schusters  taliesin he doesnt know about the schusters  marisha oh but you talked about getting people out  taliesin no we mentioned /none/ vaguely that we might want something  matt i am curious as to what you are referring to  taliesin we have some friends that are currently interred here for financial troubles nothing  dangerous nothing violent we were wondering if we could make a deal for maybe some leniency if  thats possible  marisha take that 200 gold consider it their bail and time served  taliesin also we do have a bit of the mechanism and if everybody here is all right i am of the  opinion that if anybody asks us it was your brilliant /none/ idea to let us into that cell in the  first place to take care of this problem if anybody asks we know who is absolutely  responsible for this  liam you picked us specifically  sam poppin drokrusher  taliesin you saw something in us you took a chance and were grateful for it  marisha and this guy will agree to that right cleff i elbow cleff  matt oh of course great deal ooh sternum its a bit pain go ahead and make a persuasion  check with advantage  taliesin all right come on man /none/ for fucks sake thats a six  marisha total  matt a six  taliesin i dont have any persuasion i dont know why  matt why you keep leading these social encounters  taliesin somebody should pick up but we dont have our talker here right now  matt well you got a talker but thats okay he takes a keen look at you goes over and starts  thumbing through papers goes through his books picks one and goes schuster schuster  schuster all right i found the report here he turns the page that looks like they /none/ were  arrested for false idol worship that is not a minor offense  liam look at it this way one path we could take is that you are the mastermind who hired the right  people for the job and everything is perfect the other path we talk about how we came in and fixed  things you could not  matt the schusters are still to serve a twoyear sentence both of them to pay the amount to bail  them out would be at this point about 350 gold with the 200 that were offered that would /none/ put you  at a 150 bail amount should you wish to indeed pay for these very important friends of yours  marisha well considering you have a hunk of metal down in your basement that is worth at least  100 gold worth of scrap that im sure the assembly yard would love to have  matt and they will because its still technically commissioned originally by the prison  so we own the rights to its carcass however the moment of negotiation is over this is my price as  it stands either you receive the 200 and /none/ walk away or you can continue to pay the bail and they  will be released that is up to you  liam ja i think that’s a fair deal jester would you mind settling this debt for us  taliesin yeah thats no problem jester will be happy to pay  laughter  taliesin 150 gold  matt 150 gold  taliesin laura you can text right now  ashley oh no  taliesin thats okay laura will text if she has a problem with that  marisha fjord can foot half since hes sympathetic  taliesin fjord will /none/ pay half so 75 gold each  matt thats true  marisha fjord says you know what to keep them out of that orphanage  liam your gold laura or your maternal bond you choose  taliesin seven okay so thats all right bump bump oh and look at that its all done look at  that its all done that all happened  matt look at that its beautiful  marisha hes like no money was spent  taliesin its as if it never was  ashley what a bunch of assholes  taliesin thats what you get for /none/ getting knocked up man right there sorry  laughter  matt at this point he  marisha kids are expensive  taliesin kids are a deep financial drain man  matt its true  liam man dont i know it  matt he accepts the coin shouts out to he says micahl and this female halfling comes  rushing in he says i would like for you to write a writ for me of success in clearing the  lower regions of the prison under the watchful eye of the wardenhelm poppin drokrusher i thank you  and also could /none/ we please have sent up immediately a he leans forward gilda and wallace schuster  they are on the second level in cell 12b they have had their bail paid the halfling rushes  off some of the guards leave with her and about 20 or so minutes later you hear the footsteps  return and there you see this couple they pull forward dirty sallow not very wellfed but  alive and they both look bewildered the man whos got a thick graying brown scruff and the  hair a bit shaken from his form he glances up at /none/ the rest of you i dont understand whats happening  sam its all right  taliesin we never understand whats happening either  marisha gilda wallace  matt the woman looks over she has this long curled and tangled brownishred hair she goes  is this true were free  marisha why dont we get outside and then well talk  sam lets have a meat pie  laughter  matt with that you guide the now nolongerprisoners outside of the gearhold  prison and as the small door opens to lead them out into the late afternoon air the /none/ sunlight hits  them and you see them blink and wince and then look up and smile as this is probably the first  sunlight theyve seen in six months you can see a bit of glimmer as tears begin to form at the edge  of their eyes and the two the couple look at each other and smile and hold each other and  look back at the group of you and say thank you but why  marisha lets just say your kids made an impression on us  matt are they all right where are they /none/  sam theyre at your house the butcher place dont worry well take you there theyre being  kept safe by a tiny bird with a dagger  matt they look at you and look both frightened by the words you say and then equally frightened  by the creature they now realize that is saying it and go right right  taliesin best not to think about it  sam sometimes the people that help you are the least expected  marisha i was going to say eclectic but sure  matt thank you  liam thank heavens for /none/ little blessings  matt thank you very much can we go to our children please  all yes  matt with that you guys all make your way back up the switchback path to the idleworks shelf  just as the sun begins to hit the mountains the skies turning to the oranges and reds of the  coming sunset at this point the people of the city begin to rise in energy once more as the  whistles of a days work come to a close the city beings to liven up once more into an air of  /none/ celebration music blasting around you on all sides  marisha its like being in vegas for more than 24 hours youre like no not again i cant do  this for a third night in a row ugh  taliesin roll for dubstep  matt as you guys push through the streets now the celebration expanding and exploding throughout  the vicinity your stilllingering hangovers from the night before mixed with your physically  damaged selves make you less jovial in this space eventually you make your way to the back to  the location of the previously boardedup butcher /none/ shop it appears to be left alone closed locked  and as you left it  whistling knocking  marisha oh your way was way more cool  whistling knocking  taliesin its us open it up  matt you hear some shuffling and the door opens austin and gail look past and open the door as  soon as gail can say youre back they look and you can see their parents right there smile  back at them with that they rush out gail and austin and wrap their arms around their mother  and father behind them /none/ skittering layla and jude look past and they run up as well and hold  them now this family unit of six all brought together again as filthy as they may be in their  current garb and lifestyle hold themselves amongst the glowing of distant fireworks going  off an unknowing celebration that the city holds for this family behind you see kiri shuffle out  see whats happening then also come forward and put her arms around the family and looks back at  you with a smile like jester yes i am a good girl  ashley /none/ oh my goodness  marisha this is making me really emotional  liam this could be our chance to find a good home for her  sam yes  matt kiri steps away from the group looks at the rest of you takes the dagger out steps forward  and goes like nott the mighty nein  marisha kiri exhales  liam you like these kids kiri  matt like jester okay  liam ja  matt like caleb ja  liam you know you spend enough time with us beauregard and i here almost died tonight youre  just /none/ a little girl you should be playing with these kids not playing with us what about you  mom and dad  matt at this point theyre barely paying attention they look back and say  im sorry what  taliesin we have a request  marisha a favor in return  liam in exchange beauregard  marisha no you were nailing it we did a jinxies thing yeah  matt fjord steps in next to you as well and goes look no children should be without their  parents and were happy to have brought you back together be /none/ more careful make sure that if you  do anything that could put your kids at risk dont he looks over and defers back to you caleb  liam we get into trouble quite a bit i feel guilty bringing this young girl with us weve  gone to great lengths to get you out and all i cant speak for the group but all i ask is that  you give this girl some parents  marisha fjords right no child should be separated from their parents unfortunately this  little one was  matt the parents look at /none/ each other and down at the kids the little girl layla with her curled  red hair goes does this mean she can stay and looks over at kiri kiri looks between them and  you and looks temporarily conflicted and confused but you can see a bit of understanding  wash over kiri reaches over and takes from her pocket the dagger steps forward and turns it  around handle forward holds it out  marisha youve learned  matt like jester yes i am very sweet she reaches down and pulls out the music box slowly  opens /none/ it after winding it  music box plays  taliesin oh thats just mean  matt like caleb shes a pretty good egg looks up at caleb and rushes forward and gives a  big warm hug  marisha shit i turn to gilda and wallace and say look i know another mouth to feed is a lot  it would mean a lot if you take her but well help you out i reach in and i give them 50 gold  from my stash should be enough to help for a little bit hopefully make up the difference /none/  matt she accepts it wideeyed i dont know what to say  marisha well i stole 75 gold from my friend without him being here to speak for it so i feel  like its fair  matt she steps back and they look like theyre in shock still from these strangers that have come  to their aid so heavily kiri pulls back and looks to you like jester dont eat humans okay  marisha go give jester a hug i know she wished shed be here for it  matt jester you see her arms twisted up /none/ and the eyes filled with water and she goes oh were  going to come back right  sam yes well come back and check on kiri be a good girl kiri  matt she gives a big hug and goes kiri youre going to be so beautiful as you grow up and this  family is going to take care of you and is going to be your new mother and father and you’ll have  this whole family here for you remember that no matter whats happening and what you are doing  the traveler is always looking /none/ over you and we are always always thinking of you with love  jester turns around and you can see the tears welling up in her eyes  marisha i give jester a hug  matt she takes you in there fjord steps forward and ruffles the feathers on the head and says  youre always a member maybe one day youll be able to come back and use that dagger for  something thats alive kiri turns back and looks to you like nott yeza was his name  sam i guess everyone knows at this point so its /none/ okay now  matt she gives you a hug  sam thank you for listening to us  matt looks to molly and gives this distant stare  taliesin im so glad we understand each other take care of them  matt like molly take care of them looks to you and comes up and cuddles up against your  chest where she had slept the night before and chirping  ashley scratch those feathers  matt the feathers fluff up a bit  ashley goodbye kiri we will send you treasures from all of our travels  matt like /none/ jester okay  ashley we will miss you very much  matt kiri turns back and steps beside the kids the family looks out and goes if theres ever  the

the cart the horses retrieves them from where they were stored during  your stay here  sam are we making our way out of town  matt looks like it unless you guys /town/ have anything else planned  sam on the way out of town you said when we came into town there were some guards with  pistols with guns  matt yes  sam do we see any on the way out  matt make a perception check as you make your way through the bottom end of the city  sam 14  matt 14 glancing through there are two crownsguard that walk by both gnomish one of  them appears to be carrying a heavy sword on the back the other one does have some sort of strange  /none/ contraption like a firearm pistol at its side  sam im going to try to steal it  matt make a sleight of hand check  marisha yes  sam with either mage hand or my own hand whatevers  matt up to you  sam mage hand  matt all right  sam what am i doing sleight of hand  matt sleight of hand so your proficiency modifier plus your dex  sam oh 19 then so not sleight of hand this is a dexterity check  matt well no sleight of hand is im sorry no its /none/ a sleight of hand check  sam oh well then its 22  matt 22 yeah my brain i was thinking of unlocking it glides past over you the guard’s  none the wiser  sam okay  matt it is loaded with a single shot  sam great  matt so you have a singleshot pistol with no ammunition  sam its loaded with a bullet though right  matt yes  sam okay cool great thats all i care about  matt all right with that  marisha if youre deserted on an island to kill yourself with /dung/  matt in those final dark moments this campaign goes really dark suddenly with that you guys  head out past the fences the artillery construction ranges the plumes of smoke and  steam the dualshelved levels of the gnomish city of hupperdook with the people adventures that  you met and left behind and forge your way on further up the crispvale roadway heading towards  the glory run road that heads north towards nogvurot and the shadycreek run heading on for  the next better half of the day you make a fair amount of travel before the /town/ sun eventually sets  before you can reach the crossroads eventually having to pull off to the side of the road to make  camp for the first night there you head off your general curious range there you set up a small  camp whos taking first watch  liam nott and i  matt okay nott and caleb if you wouldnt mind rolling a perception check with advantage or both  of you roll it individually  sam you go  liam with advantage  matt no he rolled and now you  sam i got a nine /none/  liam you got okay here comes oh big eight  matt all right you guys take your first watch nothing though youre not paying much attention  nothing seems to transpire during that first watch period you finish it without issue the second  watch come up fjord goes ahead and says ill take it  ashley ill join you  matt youll join as well yasha  ashley yeah  matt all right you guys take your second watch fjord and yasha are currently situated there two  of you are up its now pushing past maybe one /none/ or two in the morning the fire is burned low to  embers at this point and youre both staying close for heat fjords sitting there looking and  goes im kind of proud of all this you know  ashley i am too im actually very surprised at the choices weve made especially the choices  that ive made  matt yeah a lot of these folks have surprised me a little voice goes like as jester some  people are trying to sleep  ashley sorry jester  matt but i’m awake now fjord goes like let’s take /none/ a walk fjord stands up jester stands up  and the three of you step away for a minute fjord looks up at the stars and goes dreams’ve been  weird for all the visions the darkness out there it’s good to know that somehow maybe were  all putting a little bit of light in there too  ashley that’s a very nice way to put it  matt who knows maybe we’ll find ourselves a path somewhere along the coast in the long run  could show you some of my hometown maybe some of yours but maybe /none/ not quite as well put together  jester interjects at this point and goes well if we do go back i could show you if it is safe  depending on what my mom says the places where i grew up the beautiful shorelines have you been  to the menagerie coast before  ashley i’ve never been to the coast  matt oh it is so beautiful it would be incredible  ashley i’ve seen  matt her mouth isn’t making noise you go to talk no sound comes out of it either there’s a  look of confusion /none/ amongst the three of you i need you to make a wisdom saving throw yasha  what did you roll  ashley i rolled 11  matt in that moment of panic you go to reach for your weapon and suddenly your muscles seize up  and your body is unable to move your eyes glance back at fjord who seems to be in the same  position the falchion apparates in his hand but he is unable to move jester is the only one who  is like as she turns to run for the group and impacts the /dung/ chest of a dark humanoid figure who’s  standing there who grabs and holds her in place four other dark figures emerge from the shadows  around and grab and immediately put their arms around you you try and resist from the spell in  fact make another wisdom saving throw  sam oh god  ashley natural 20  sam whoa  matt fjord maintains it but all this in absolute silence there is no sound just shadows and  starlight as you’re now being grappled by two men the spell breaks from you however they’re  still holding /none/ you as you feel a gag pulled over your mouth from one of them the other one begins  to throw rope around you you’re looking over the side and you can see another gag showed into  fjord’s mouth manacles are being shoved onto his arms and legs hes unable to move jester tries  to break free off the opposite not with a natural seven she’s kicking and screaming but  there is no sound coming out and as she’s pushed down another figure comes up and throws shackles  onto her arms behind her and her legs /none/ she’s yelling and yelling and a gag is pulled over her  mouth what are you doing  ashley am i  matt there’s two people that are now coming to grapple you  ashley i take out my weapon and i’m ready to go  matt all right you pull your weapon make an attack if you want  ashley yes okay 25  matt 25 hits roll damage on that  taliesin where was this  sam she’s a bad motherfucker  ashley 18  matt 18 damage oof you have a second attack if you like  /none/ ashley oh that’s a nine  matt your first one impacts one guy and there’s a splash of blood silent once again no sound  here the second one swings wide and the other guy captures it he grabs your arm and pulls you in  he’s going to make an athletics check against you make an athletics or acrobatics check to try and  not be grappled  ashley 13  matt that’s not going to make it he grapples and holds you in place the other one takes and slams  manacles onto your wrists and pulls it /none/ back wrenching the blade from your grasp your arms are  now locked behind you into these metal manacles  ashley can i try to scream out in some way to the stormlord  matt you go ahead and scream make a straight wisdom check  ashley three  matt in that moment as you try and scream out your vocal cords strained by the sheer force of  your voice no sound comes out looking up in the sky there isn’t a single cloud in sight probably  for the first time in weeks since you’ve been in this /none/ side of wildemount it is a clear night no  sign of clouds no sign of storm in that moment as you’re screaming out the gag gets put into  your mouth and tied behind your head you glance over and you can see jester being dragged now the  manacles affixed to the back of her ankles and she’s being pulled through the grass fjord a few  feet behind her still unable to really make out the shapes of these hooded figures that are  pulling them through and you are shoved to the ground  ashley are /none/ my legs still free  matt your ankles are about to be manacled  ashley can i kick  matt make another athletics check  ashley 25  matt 25 all righty with that you manage to kick free and they can’t quite get ahold on it and  one figure steps forward shorter than the others stout looking and goes oh for the and his  voice dissipates as he gets closer i need you to make another wisdom saving throw  ashley 17  matt you’re still kicking and breaking free they’re going to try to restrain you /none/ once more  roll one more athletics check  ashley eight  matt no that’s not going to do it as much as you struggle right now you’re by yourself now it  looks like two figures holding you down and the third one that is frustrated that you have  resisted a spell a second time they get the manacles on the back of your legs your arms are  held behind your ankles are now pulled up towards where your hands are and you are face down in the  wet grass in the middle of the night /dung/ as you feel your body now being dragged by the chains  dragged dragged your mouth is filled with the taste of the sweat that’s poured down that’s  soaked into the gag thats now forced in your mouth grass and grime and mud are grinding  against your face all you can see is the dark shadow there and the bits of star and sky ahead  until eventually you’re lifted upright right back once more immediately you can see a series of  wide carts large travel caravan carts that are low set covered with piles of goods /none/ looks like  sacks and a couple of crates fairly sparselooking for travel caravan crates but what  you see travel up and down the roads all the time there are three of them with horses to the front  of them you can see about eight other figures around these carts as you’re up held there with  your mouth gagged and your arms and legs bound you look off to the side and you can see fjord and  jester also struggling and unable to find their way about jester begins to flex against it and  you /dung/ can see her strong physique pushing against it and she gets smacked upside the cheek by one  of the men that pulls her and holds her in place you hear a voice speak up and say hey look what  we found eh you see a dark figure step closer to you glancing up through the minimal light a  human man tall and brutish his head is completely bald on top revealing a scarred and  tattooed design across one side that curls down into his lightly leathered armored chest his  thick brow hangs over two cold /none/ uncaring eyes he nods in approval to these three acquisitions that  you are revealing a number of golden teeth between his cracked lips his muscular body is  mostly obscured by a cloak and hood beyond that armor the thug goes lorenzo your instincts are  sharp looks like we found ourselves a sudden bounty the heavy figure who hasn’t spoken at  this point kneels down and grabs the chins of each of you grabs jester who is now shaking  with anger and fear in her eyes looks both sides of her face goes to fjord and /none/ lifts the chin  comes to you and grabs  ashley i spit in his face  matt the gag is right there so you coughing looks like this one’s got some spirit too  chuckles our prospects are good with this find two divineblood and one halfbeast i’m pleased  toss them in with the others we’ll head back our cages are at capacity now he stands back up and  turns around and heads back to the carts as you’re all being thrown to your sides again and  being dragged through the wet grass and dirt over /none/ rocks you can feel gashes being pulled across  your face and shoulders as you’re being pulled through the dirt you’re righted once more and two  more goons lift you up towards the back of this mostly empty cart it seems just small piles and  boxes and then suddenly your vision shifts as if you’re being pulled through a curtain and these  carts are piled high with cages and the opened one that the three of you are showed into clangs  behind you this five feet by five feet box as the three of you are /dung/ jammed into each other  uncomfortably you look about inside under what looks to be a darkened tarp that covers the cages  glancing out the side of your eye you can see in the one next to you that there are other dark  humanoid figures quietly whimpering and not moving you hear heyup and the horses begin to  pick up speed as the creaking of wheels turning get faster and the feel of the cart beginning to  move and that’s where we’re going to finish tonight’s session  groaning  sam was she taken and fjord /none/ and jester  taliesin the three of them yep  sam all in the same cart  taliesin yep  ashley fuck  marisha my heart  sam we heard it with our passive perception  marisha they were in a silence spell  sam oh i forgot to tell you
