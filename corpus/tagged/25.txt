none	 band of friends seeking to make a name for yourselves the streets of ironforge grow  dull with fetch quests and baking runs gilneas biggest torment is a terrible flea infestation  after stormwind holds a petracing contest which you each individually lose you gather your  frustration and head east in search of real adventure trudging through a mire of  uninteresting quests and aid to local farmhands and wandering merchants youve all amassed some  equipment to aid you for the new challenges ahead although the patchwork sources leave your gear  somewhat mismatched in color and make 
tavern	 bundle you in particular seem to take pride in your  limegreen robes that you were assured carried a powerful enchantment  taliesin its from a boutique  matt your troupe has now found your way to the valley of the red ridge mountains seeking solid  work only to find the work boards empty and the wild beasts that roam the surrounding landscape  well in the hands of the local guard you all sit within the lakeshire inn within the village of  lakeshire two cups into your woes as you lament your life choices and clashing attire 
none	 the warm  interior is rather vacant outside of your band the hearth empty with naught but a smoldering log  to combat the chill morning air thats right youre two cups in for breakfast the innkeeper  brianna yawns and leaves as the bartender of fieryorange shoulderlength hair and mustache  walks over to deliver your next round of breakfast drinks  laura sure is chilly in this place huh woo maybe you can add another log there  matt over here in the fireplace  laura yeah in that hearth  matt ill throw one on okay  
none	 laura thanks  matt let me know if you want another round  liam this is a little weak do you have anything stronger than this  matt i can go look but i got to do the log thing first  liam all right log then grog yes  taliesin if you have a menu of breakfast beers that would be most gracious  matt all right he looks a bit scattered but goes off to put the log in the hearth so as we  go around the table if you wouldnt mind taking a moment to describe 
none	 your character as you appear at  the table  travis yes i am lohkor windfallow paladin keeper of virtues and righteousness i am  devilishly handsome and i dont play well with others because of that devilish handsomeness but  my skills are always for sale and my fellows seem to appreciate my roguish good looks  laura you are quite handsome oh hi my name is greldamine clypsol im a gnome mage i am short  even for a gnome i know thats fine i wear my hair in a high bun its brown im just the  
none	 biggest fan of jaina proudmore i think shes just the most amazing mage ive ever seen you know i  hear good things about her shes so powerful and beautiful sounds amazing i hear i dont  know i havent met her in person  taliesin i have to catch my breath okay my name is bundle im a dwarf ive got a very very nice  lime green robe  laura its beautiful  taliesin thank you im very proud im a priest and ive been studying for quite some time  learning my trade perfecting it im a 
none	 bit behind i mean ive got some younger brothers  that are doing much better than i am and certainly theyre succeeding more and going  further and thats fine im doing my best im taking my own pace going a bit bald and im  trying to do my best to bring it over and its going into a its not a great beard but i use  the ham hocks to liven it up a bit  travis its good no it frames your face very well  taliesin and i feel like im making my way at 
dung	 my own pace very well more beer  jennifer im aerwin whiteclaw its been quite a long time since ive been in this much company  its rather overwhelming i am a night elf of the rogue persuasion i come from a long line of  rogues i attempted to be rather more of a businessperson and healer but was quickly dragged  into the family business i spend large amounts of time alone in the dark by myself i dress in  black i prefer it that way  laughter  travis no reason to spend all that time 
none	 by yourself  jennifer ready for another drink  laughter  liam yes my name is quazirat toluus  laura quazirat toes  liam quazirat toluus  taliesin all ten of them  liam all ten yes i am draenei wear all white at all times top and bottom underneath and  front whole nine yards i am simple man i like to test myself in battle for the glory of argus  every day of my life for the glory of argus i also like to sample the fine spirits of the realm  and i am a big 
none	 player of mmorpgs i like to unwind at night when i am done killing the burning  legion  laura whats your handle  liam it is lrjenkins1234  laura creative i like it  matt at this point the bartender comes by this time with the next round of drinks the one log he  placed in there is starting to catch a little bit but its cold enough in the morning where its  taken a little while the smokes billowing up bit of it dribbling past the top of the fireplace  and hitting what you can 
tavern	 see is a casual stain of gray that reaches the roof of the interior of  the tavern above it as he sets it down he goes im sorry i didnt mean to eavesdrop but based  on your conversation and attire i can see that you seem to be aspiring problem solvers is that  right  travis i guess so that does describe us doesnt it  jennifer i suppose  matt wonderful well im the bartender here and my name is wental i happen to have a problem  thats in need of saving friends and solving 
tavern	 you see this inn its been in my family for  generations left to me by my late father and while it does keep me busy and he looks around  to a very empty tavern around you extremely busy my passions lie elsewhere my hobby my greatest  of loves is being a smear monger  travis a what  matt a smear monger  laura that sounds great  matt a smear monger a chandler crafter of light  laura of course  matt a candlemaker  travis laura taliesin oh  laura what kind of candles  
none	 matt oh all kinds of candles scented colorful sizes long wicks short wicks  travis explosive  matt no but i havent dabbled either  jennifer any black ones  matt ah thatll bring us to the crux of our conversation there were ive been hoarding all  of the oils and fats from the kitchen since i was a boy slowly learning to build a stock and keep  it beneath my bed and eventually moving it to a shed offsite reading what books i can in secret  if my father knew my interests in candle making anyway 
none	 and you can see his eyes begin to well up  a bit and his hands are shaking i went to go to my storage shed after buying a small homestead in  goldshire and hoping to open a shop at some point in the future its all gone all of it just  gone every single candle ive made gone  laura even your fat stores  matt well the fat stores are normally stored in there but theyve gone bad since i asked for it  to be investigated but the guard laughed at me they have no 
none	 appreciation for fine candlework  you notice across the room one of the other women who are in there whos the local voyeur  chuckles under her breath and she eats her cold toast and stays at the table wental shoots her an  icy dagger glance and back to you i ask if you would help retrieve my lifes work i would  greatly make it worth your while i have my savings which isnt much about 520 gold pieces  and i could probably muster some armor that matches  laura thatd be great  matt what do 
none	 you say  laura do you have robes  matt that could be arranged  taliesin doesnt have to match  travis yeah but we should present a united front though i mean people should be able to  see that we are a group  jennifer as long as its black  liam as long as its white  taliesin as long as its lime green  laura im partial to purple  matt ill see what i can do about dye colors ill have to send away possibly to westfall they  have some good dyers there but 
none	 if you agree to this then the sooner we can get off the better  and he twirls his mustache with both of his fingers a nervous tick or an exclamation of  physicality shall we  jennifer ill agree as long as you never do that again  matt very well  taliesin there was a fisherman who did like 25 of those little red plants but this sounds better  laura this sounds fun wental you can count on us i jump on top of the table and raise my fist  into the air  jennifer i 
none	 shrink into my chair  matt he awkwardly reaches out and side fistbumps not sure what to do  laura candles  matt i like her  travis im sure this mornings fare will be also a part of our arrangement  matt sure  liam and i was going to ask for a couple bottles of your best vintage to be added to the agreed  upon price  travis and jennifer yes  matt very well ill be happy to place it upon your tab that will be wiped clean upon the  retrieval of my candles  
town	 jennifer a steed or two i saw something out back that looked rather suitable  matt ill see what i can do i only have so much i can do in the town but let me try anyway and  he rushes off he comes back and he brings you two bottles of wine not the greatest you dont get a  lot of decent import over here on lakeshore unfortunately its a little out of the way  liam will it mess me up  matt if you were to chug it now most likely  liam thats a 
tavern	 deal  matt all righty follow me ill take you to the shed see if you can learn anything  laura great  matt so wental guides you outside the lakeshore inn around the back and up past some bushes  theres a number of trees that crest right against the base of the red ridge mountains just above  the location of the inn as he comes around you can see theres the one stable off to the side he  goes ill talk to them and see what i can do but to be honest the stable master 
none	 and me dont  really get along  jennifer just show me where he is im sure we can work something out  matt very well should i take you to the shed first or do you need your steed now  laura maybe to the shed since its close  jennifer we can go to the shed i dont want to make the small one run  laura thank you  matt i dont mind all right and you see he seems to have confidence around the gnome and  then he gets really sheepish in the gaze of 
none	 the night elf who stares down and probably stands a  good six inches taller than him so he leads you up past this section to the base of the mountains  and you can see theres a really nicelooking shed thats settled between the edge of the mountains  and a tree over there its closed its locked up theres chains but as you walk up you can  see that the actual lock has been broken and the chains dangle off to the sides of the two doors  that open up into it  taliesin theres your 
none	 trouble you left it unlocked  travis i think someone broke the lock  taliesin youre making assumptions i feel thats a lot to just assume just taking your  first look  matt squeak he opens the front doors to the shed and upon looking inside you can see there  are shelves arranged there are small crates that have been pried open across the entirety of the  floor you see scraps of wax scattered here and there large spaces where apparently clusters of  it were set and have since been pulled and it is entirely empty 
none	 and scraped of any possible  remainder of wax and theres a sudden smell that comes out too it could be a combination of  either rotting animal bits andor some element of fecal matter its hard to really pick out but  its not a pleasant interior  liam are there any markings footprints different toe patterns any kind of clues  matt i looked everywhere and saw nothing im also a bartender and thats why i asked you guys  so if you want to have a look please  liam yeah i was actually asking the dm 
none	  matt oh okay  liam do i see with my draenei eyes as i stroke my chin tentacles  laura you have tentacles you have tentacles on your chin  liam on my chin i dont like to draw attention to them  travis you dont need to theyre just there  matt so are you getting to the ground  liam thats right  matt make an investigation check  liam yes im making an investigation check im rolling a d20 thats not very good that is hold  on ive just solved the entire game thats a 
none	 two  matt you get close to the ground and theres a lot of small bits of wax and you start pulling  them together and piecing them and you figure if you spend the next couple hours you can maybe put  together a very small candle  liam there were candles here  matt you are correct  travis quazi you are astute as always bundle would you mind checking the lock to see if  theres  taliesin i take a look at the lock  matt make an investigation check  taliesin oh boy oh wow 
none	  travis oh no its cold in here  laura warm it up guys  taliesin seven  matt seven the lock appears to have been broken through blunt force but you have no other  information you can draw from it  taliesin lock appears to have been broken by blunt force i dont know  jennifer let me have a look  matt all right if you want to go ahead and make an investigation check as well  liam thats a good idea okay thats better than us so you go from there to there and add 
none	 that  jennifer so its 13  matt 13 so as you start glancing around first things first when you get closer to the ground  and elements of the doorway you can smell in the air its almost like a wet fur scent in the air  and as you glance towards the edge of the sheds opening in the mud and dirt that surrounds the  exterior you can see faint foot tracks smattering in different directions many of them theres  multiple sets soled shoes or boots of some kind but it looks almost like theres also 
dung	 a toe or two  protruding from the front smaller than a mans feet they lead away from the shed and then  further up the mountain range to the westward direction  jennifer ive seen these before its been a long time it was very far from here i hesitate to  name it ill leave that to the dungeon master its my first game  liam you can also tell there were candles here yes  jennifer yes i can smell there were candles here  matt so go ahead and roll a d20 and add your intelligence 
none	 modifier to this one so look at  your intelligence liam want to help her with the intelligence modifier  liam intelligence modifier is up here yeah five plus  jennifer so 13  matt thats a saving throw  liam oh so intelligence check you say intelligence check well then its just that  plus where the hell is it there it is  jennifer ten  matt ten okay you recall seeing tracks like this before but the name is on the tip of your  tongue youre not entirely certain what it could be  jennifer the 
town	 names on the tip of my tongue and i cant quite grab it can someone else grab it for  me  travis yes let me see if i recognize these tracks  laura does anyone know that you make candles other than your father  matt well he doesnt know yet i was going to open the store first and have him come take a look  at it  laura oh okay so you dont have any candle enemies  matt i dont believe so not in this town there isnt a candlemaker not anymore  laura and 
none	 are your candles scented  matt some of them were  laura do most of them smell like animal fat  matt yes they do by their very nature but i try best to add lavender to the batch and  occasionally  jennifer lavender you say  matt yes lavender  liam what about pahtpourri  travis weve discussed this its potpourri  liam youre dropping off the t  travis well its just potpourri  liam youre fucking with me  travis no for the fourth time  laura were you going to track them  travis id 
none	 like to try  matt make a survival check  travis natural 20  laura is that with your grog dice  travis with my die  matt you watch as the armored human paladin gets low his eyes suddenly spark as he looks to the  left looks to the right looks down to the ground and almost like a hound dog begins  trailing this track curving around the shed into the west as you guys slowly follow suit  taliesin this is why we pay him big gold bucks right there  travis and because im handsome 
none	  matt as you guys follow wental stays a few steps behind he seems excited but also not sure what  you guys are going to discover and you can see the tension rising in him his shoulders are slowly  creeping up across the sides of his head  laura yes were clearly much more experienced fighters than you are  matt i completely agree i hope at this point you catch up to your human paladin friend over  there and you find the tracks lead up to a large cluster of bushes that are embedded right in 
none	 the  base of the mountain range theyre thorny theyre dry its a small bramble cluster its  about five or so feet up its a wide chunk and you can see bits and pieces of it scattered across  the edge of the mountain range here as you get closer you can see some of the jagged edges of the  boosh have a faint a boosh the boosh  travis are you amused by the boosh  matt you find the boosh rather amusing on the jagged edges of the bush you see faint elements of  a 
dung	 waxy residue that have been scraped onto some of the thorns of the brambles  liam probably unrelated  matt just beyond you can barely see a dark recess about four feet tall and about four feet  wide behind the bush that presses into the mountain range  travis the tracks lead to this bush if you see just beyond theres a recess in the mountains  laura how big is the recess  travis its like four what is it how far about  matt four foot wide and four foot tall  laura oh thats small for 
none	 a human  travis indeed it is  laura so i wonder if these creatures who stole the candles are smaller than humans  travis my hypothesis exactly  taliesin or theyre prone to crawling  laura oh or that  taliesin they could be crawlers thats some mean crawlers  jennifer gren grel greldamin  laura greldamine its okay its a hard name especially for elves  laughter  jennifer it looks like you could stand upright in that hole  laura i could  jennifer yes its another element we should factor into our search  laura should 
none	 i go in should we all go in  liam you first little one  laura gladly can we move these thorny bushes out of the way though  travis absolutely i start ripping the dried brush out of the  matt the brush is actually not attached to the ground it comes and pulls out of the way really  easily  jennifer does he fall on his butt when he pulls on it that hard  matt he almost does he teeters on one foot as his sheer show of strength to tear them out  overcompensates and 
none	 his armored self being top heavy as he is he stands there and awkwardly  wobbles in place and for a moment you see as the bartender wental swallows deeply out of the  choice of companions that hes hired for this  laura wental are you coming with us  matt oh goodness no  travis are you sure we have extra daggers and all sorts of things  matt i have a job its busy lot of people in there i need to make drinks and breakfast i  hired you to do this for me please do 
none	 this for me  laura of course yes dont worry  travis we will take care of this and be back expediently you can count on us  matt wonderful thank you  jennifer please have dinner ready  matt yes maam you cant tell if hes crushing or legitimately super frightened but good  luck  jennifer one and the same  matt so pulling the brush out of the way you can see this has been a deliberatelydug cavern that  recedes into the mountain and into darkness  laura hello  matt imitates echo it does echo 
dung	 a bit  travis can you see in the dark  laura yes but i also have light and i send light down the tunnel can i do that can i send  light down the tunnel or does it light up around me  matt well you choose an object to then light up like it was a torch  laura oh what do we have on us  travis i have a torch i have ten of them  laura oh well we should probably just use a torch then  liam theres also rocks on the ground 
none	  laura oh ill pick up a rock and cast light on the rock that was a good idea  whateveryourtoes  liam yes is there room for our world of warcraft pauldrons to go into this space  matt four foot wide at your size barely it scrapes the edges as you push inward digging two  small grooves along the cavern  jennifer lets send him first someone push him from behind  taliesin grease it up and hell squeeze right in there  jennifer theres candle wax around  taliesin wax the corners and push him through 
none	  liam either the small magic one or the sneaky one should be going first i think yes  jennifer well she can stand upright  laura ill go first  liam all right little stinker lets see what you can do  matt all right so greldamine as you light up the rock in your hand and its giving off this  bright torch light you hold it in front of you and you walk right into it as soon as you begin  to step into the chamber you can already feel theres a faint cold breeze blowing 
none	 from the open  world behind you into the chamber youre drawn deeper and deeper into the darkness within as it  begins to faintly grade into a descent whats the order in which you guys are traveling behind her  laura oh jeez this is so dumb that im in the front  matt and laura what do you mean  laura with my 37 hit points  travis youre so squishy  taliesin were all a little squishy  travis to make you feel better i will be second  laura okay  taliesin ill go right in 
dung	 the middle  jennifer if youd like a wall behind us ill go after him  liam all right dramamine lead the way  matt as you continue delving deeper down this cavern the smell of damp earth seems to be ever  present as a recent rainfall has left a lot of this path the early portion of it rather muddy  your feet slip and slick against the soft floor as you occasionally have to right yourself against  the walls of the cavern being careful as you push deeper into this now after some time the path 
none	  comes to an abrupt halt where the floor seems to drop down about five feet into a tunnel that opens  larger and wider 15 feet below you deeper still into the mountain  laura shh can i hear anything  matt make a perception check  laura ooh 23  travis wow  matt what little bit of wind is passing through down into the cavern you can hear what sounds  like a faint rock falling some scraping sounds and a door slam distant below you and distant  jennifer might this be a good time for 
none	 some shadow melding  laura what is that  matt its up to you you can only use it once per short rest so keep that in mind if theres  nothing currently around you can still stealth whenever you want to  jennifer im inclined to stealth  laura oh yeah you can stealth  jennifer im inclined to stealth  matt okay so yeah go ahead and roll a stealth check  jennifer ill be the stealth person all right so  laura we can all try to stealth right now if you want to  liam it 
none	 would be better because heres the thing even if you are supremely sneaky which you are  im fucking bullshit with sneaking so we all have to you know pull our weight  laura maybe youll roll a 20  liam well see how i do three  jennifer 28  matt your darker night elf complexion vanishes into the shadows there you go i love it  taliesin 15  laura 13  travis 13 as well  liam and i lied five  matt that makes a difference all right so as you guys all quietly look down 
none	 into this small  cavern it drops down youre looking over the edge  laura like five feet  matt like five six feet down below you jump down if you want to  laura should we jump down  liam yeah theyll never see us coming  shushing  jennifer put a sock in it so i suppose i should go ahead im going to sneak ahead because im the  sneaky one in this one all right im sneaking ahead  matt as you guys all leap down into the tunnel below you  jennifer oh oh grunt 
none	  matt okay said that you all leap in afterward you go ahead and begin to sneak ahead a bit and it  switches back a bit and goes into a much more steady decline in the direction of where you came  from below  jennifer is it slippery  matt its actually much drier now youre further away from the cavern entrance it looks like the  water  jennifer its much drier here im going ahead i smell something its very familiar but my  intelligence is not as high as id like so i cant remember 
none	 what it is  taliesin lavender  laura ooh  jennifer it smells like lavender it does good reminder  laura does it  matt you dont smell lavender as well  taliesin no never mind thats just me being a nuisance  jennifer i dont smell lavender i take that back  matt but you  jennifer stop it im new  matt you do begin to hear as you begin your approach what sounds like faint rushing water  jennifer i hear rushing water  matt and you see ahead as youre pushing forward are you guys following 
none	 behind her  laura yeah no were following were following  matt so like hanging about 20 feet or so back  laura yeah  matt eventually the path begins to curve to the left and you can see a faint source of light that  begins to emerge around the corner as you begin to curve around  laura whispering what does it look like  jennifer whispering it looks like a long thin ray of light vertical i think ive been waiting  to find out if im right  travis are you making this up  jennifer 
none	 i am totally am i allowed am i allowed to do that  laura no  jennifer oh ill stop now i dont know this game yet  liam what happens is he will create the environment and the things around you and you  interact with them and you roll dice occasionally  jennifer im going to go under here for a minute  liam youre in control of your personality and the actions you do in this world hes the world  jennifer i dont know do i see any light  matt so as you coast around 
none	 the corner go ahead and make a perception check  jennifer okay  liam there it is oh thats shnazzy yeah what is that  jennifer counting 18  matt all right so as you coast around the corner placing your hand along the edge of the  cavern you glance over and you can see the hallway opens up into a much larger chamber of natural  stone formations and stalactites litter the roof above you the cavern top theres about 20 feet  beyond this entrance an underground river that is stretching across from one side to the 
none	 other  before diving in and vanishing beneath the rock wall on the far right side crossing this small  recess where the water seems to be rushing you can see the occasional mist and spray from wayward  rocks that are breaking up the flow of the river two rickety wood plank bridges that cross past it  are attached and nailed into portions of the rock and then right across you can see the source of  light theres a number of sources of light that are slightly shifting on the opposite end of the  chamber theres 
dung	 another platform on the other end of the river where you can see roughly nine nasty  looking humanoid creatures that are clustered with patches of fur on portions of their body they  carry satchels and packs a single melting lit candle rests atop each of their heads as their  light source in these dark tunnels  laura thats really cute  matt you now recognize what was on the tip of your tongue these are definitely kobolds and they  appear to have been coming through a door that is now closed and being locked on the 
none	 opposite side  by one of them that is larger theyre carrying these large sacks and theyre all talking amongst  each other you can see their features are somewhat ratlike and their protruded snouts  whiskers that shoot off to each side they havent noticed your presence yet  laura how tall are they  matt about three and a half four feet  laura so theyre taller than i am  matt mmhmm  laura i put my rock out  matt okay so your light source vanishes  laura yeah  liam and weve been trailing the 
none	 elf so  jennifer now were in the clear so im going to step back  laura what should we do how many of them are there  taliesin and jennifer counting one two three four  travis nine  laura nine theres about nine of them okay do you think we could take nine of them  jennifer yeah  travis of course  laura has anybody tried talking to kobolds before  travis i havent  taliesin ive never talked to one before  jennifer if our mission is to bring the candles home what would happen to 
none	 the candles if we took  them out in a violent manner would they be damaged would that  travis did we ask how many candles were missing boxes of them  laura an entire sheds worth  liam i think it was more than nine so like ten candles eleven probably well find out if we  kill them  laura i wonder if these are actual candles or if these are old candles and they stole his candles  for new candles because the candles on their head are wearing down do you know what i mean  
none	 liam you just said candles a lot of times  travis whos feeling particularly sneaky right now  laura i can be invisible  travis thats right feel like journeying in a little bit seeing what else you can see  laura sure sure i cast invisibility on myself  matt okay you watch as the outside of your gnomish companion shimmers and then vanishes you  find yourself invisible and you step carefully  laura okay im going to walk across the bridge now  jennifer we can still hear you  laura yeah ill be quiet once i 
none	 get towards the bridge  travis see if you can see any of the other candles  laura i walk towards one of the rickety bridges  matt okay go ahead and make a stealth check with advantage because youre invisible  laura ooh yeah 22  matt okay as you carefully make your way over towards the edge of the bridge you can see the  water is about a foot and a half two feet below where the bridge is and its not rushing super  fast but enough where its breaking the water a bit youre seeing 
none	 a bit of spray and mist and you  see these nine kobold creatures across the way it looks like the one that was locking the door is  currently talking and giving instructions to the others as you see the larger one is standing there  with this massive pack on his back thats filled to the brim all of them are carrying pickaxes to  the side but he has the wicked more strongly built one as hes pointing to them hes talking  make a perception check  laura oh natural 20 ha  matt nice  
none	 so you can hear faintly what hes instructing is stop complaining weve gots to  get these tunnels boombooming before more cursed people come now you place there you place  there me i place everywhere else and they all begin to scatter a bit and make their way towards  the two bridges to begin to cross over in the direction of you  laura oh no oh god and i start backing up towards my companions i run towards them and say  theyre on their way over here theyre going to blow things up i think the 
none	 big one has the bag of  candles on his back  travis you sure you heard blow things up  laura yeah he said something about blowing things up  liam where are you  laura im right here i punch him in the knee i couldve punched something else  travis weve got to stop them theres nine of them  laura we can do it  travis theres five of us  laura what if we take out one of the bridges while theyre on the bridge cut the rope and  then some of them that 
none	 are on the bridge will fall  matt while youre having this conversation two of them have just now finished traversing the bridge  laura and travis shit  laura quick go cut the bridge  travis go cut the bridge  laura cut the rope on the bridge  jennifer can i take them out while  matt if youd like to  liam this is the time  jennifer this is the time to take them out  matt all right so as theyre having this conversation you pull around the corner with your  hand crossbow and 
none	 make a shot at the closest one to you you see one of the kobolds lumbering up  hes reaching into his satchel and hes pulling out a small rod of some kind go ahead and roll an  attack  liam all right and its at advantage because shes hiding yeah  matt exactly  liam yeah so roll it twice and take the higher one so its a 17 plus your attack from the  crossbow is a 25  jennifer 26 17 plus nine  matt oh that most definitely hits  liam plus eight  jennifer 
none	 oh sorry plus eight sorry yes right 25  matt that most definitely hits so go ahead and roll damage on that with sneak attack damage  liam so the damage is a 1d6 so you roll one of those cubes  jennifer one  liam okay three plus your sneak attack damage which is at your level  laura probably 1d6 2d6 maybe  matt its 4d6 its under the attack  jennifer there it is 4d6  laura 4d6 what level are we  matt level seven  laura oh shit  jennifer so i add ten 17 
tavern	  liam plus the five  jennifer so 22  matt 22 points of damage so as that one crosses the way it pulls out its rod and grunting  arrow whooshing cry of pain and goes straight down limp drunk et style on the ground slams face  first and is done  jennifer we need to get the other one now dont we  matt at this point the one that just finished crossing the bridge on the other side goes cera  get up walks over and kicks him then looks over and sees you holding the 
none	 hand crossbow and goes  screaming  taliesin do i have time to get one attack in  matt i need you all to roll initiative  groaning  jennifer whats initiative  liam so were seeing what the order is so roll 20 again and add this and then keep that number in  your head for a moment you changed it roll it again  jennifer i saw what it was but  liam well if you know what it was then keep it  jennifer i do know what  liam i cant read your die jen 
none	 yes thats good thats 23 okay  matt 23  liam just remember that why cant i roll well okay  travis what did you roll  liam 11  matt all right so we have 23 we have how do you spell your characters name again  jennifer aerwyn but its in either one  matt aerwin okay cool  liam jello  matt there you go perfect  taliesin 14  matt so its 20 to 15 anybody  laura oh  travis she had 23 right  matt and jennifer yeah  travis oh what was it 
none	  matt 20 to 15  travis im 15  matt all righty and spell your name for me real fast  travis lohkor  laura lohkor  matt 15 to ten  taliesin 14  laura 13  liam 11  laura lies 12  matt all righty and then  liam 11 quazirat  travis quasimodo  liam quazi  laura im naming you toes because thats all i can remember  matt all right cool so top of the round as all the kobolds now notice you guys clustered right  there at the entrance of the 
none	 cavern start rushing over the bridge their pickaxes out and the larger  one on the opposite side seeing this seems to be preparing for something what are you doing  jennifer im loading up the crossbow  matt okay so you pull out another bolt load it up and staying there and youre going to fire at  which one  jennifer theyre all behind the one in the front  matt theres the one that just kicked the guy you killed and theres two sets that are running  across the bridges currently over the water  jennifer 
none	 im going for their leader  matt okay cool so you might have to get a little closer youre about 40 feet away from him or you  can fire from now but youll have disadvantage on the attack but up to you  jennifer i can move a little closer ill move hit and then move right  matt okay  jennifer i can do that cant i  matt you can do that yeah so you go ahead and move forward your 30 feet thatll get you into  a 30 foot range youll be almost in melee 
none	 range with one of the kobolds go ahead and take a shot  at the leader  jennifer and thats these no  liam to hit you roll d20 so roll the roundy and add your attack bonus for crossbow  jennifer 16  matt 16 just hits so you roll damage its not sneak attack because youre not hidden  liam yeah so now youre just rolling d6 a cube  jennifer d6 cube which ones the d6 its this one okay there we go  liam and add a five  jennifer seven  matt there we go 
none	 seven points of damage grunting they seem angry as it begins to reach  and fiddle with the back of his pack on his back you can use your bonus action to dash backward if  youd like to back into the cavern entrance  jennifer yes i think thats most useful  matt okay so after firing the kobolds are rushing in and you back up getting behind your  allies to protect you all right that brings it to lohkor  travis i dont know why we always try and do this stealthily i get the warhammer out 
none	 and ill reach  forward to the one and take a big swing right in his face  matt go for it this is the one who kicked his friend trying to wake him up  travis 18  matt 18 hits go ahead and roll damage  travis thats 1d8 13 points of bludgeoning damage  matt 13 points of bludgeoning damage all right  travis i have another one because of extra attack  matt you do  travis nice 15  matt 15 hits  travis nice and that is seven points of bludgeoning damage  matt 
none	 all right as you rush forward the first hit hits him upside the chin you see a spatter of  blood across the rock behind you he gets back and pulls out his pickaxe his angry whiskered face  you see fury in his eyes and you sink the hammer into his face hes like cry of pain gurgle  and he falls to the ground dead  travis yes i turn to the rest of them and i say let them have it and i take off running into the  fray  matt all right great as thats 
none	 happening you running the larger leader in the back who  finishes fiddling with his pack pulls a small rod holds it up to the top of the candle on his head  and you watch it spark and lobs it in an arc over to where you are the kobolds stop running and  watch it going as it arcs over except for two of them that werent paying attention and are  charging towards you as it thudding between your legs rolls a little behind you and theres that  brief moment where everything slows down for but 
none	 an instance before it explodes in a cacophonous  explosion of flame and force i need all of you to make a dexterity saving throw  jennifer so thats the d20  liam so yeah roll d20 dexterity save so what you get on that ten plus that is here nine  matt all right so what did you get  jennifer 18  matt okay that succeeds  taliesin eight  matt nope  laura 18  matt succeeds  travis 16  matt just barely succeeds  liam and this is a save not ability skill correct  
none	 matt right  liam oh thats big 11  matt thats a failure  liam no i dont think so  matt all right so bundle and quazirat you guys both suffer 18 points of fire damage  liam seems fake  matt the rest of you suffer nine points of fire damage and the two nearest kobolds who are  rushing in to go after lohkor also explode into pieces and are thrown behind you you see them  running like screaming explosion and are destroyed by their own dynamite and you hear this  laughter at the back 
none	 of the cavern firework he seems to be rather excited and given this bit of  fury inspirational boost from the carnage hes caused all right thats going to end his turn  hes going to stay right there at the edge bundle your turn  taliesin everything hurts one second im finding a thing  travis new class abilities were all like flexing in the thing that weve never played  before  taliesin i know this is so difficult  jennifer at least im not the only one  taliesin im going to quickly cast mass healing word 
none	 on everybody while i not even get up im  going to sit up and cast mass healing word on the group  matt okay so go ahead and roll that thats a d4 plus your  taliesin oh thats right its auto so d4 plus wisdom modifier thats six  matt all right so everyone heals six hit points  taliesin and im going to use my bonus action to create a spiritual weapon  matt okay what kind of weapon is it taking the form of  taliesin a giant hammer that looks a little bit like an 
none	 anvil thats bigger than his hammer its  going to manifest right above the main kobolds head ten feet up  matt all right so as it begins to apparate in the sky lohkor you look across and you can see  the hammer slightly larger than your hammer apparate  travis son of a bundle  matt it does take a swing at the leader so go for it i believe when you summon it gets to take  one hit  taliesin does it get to take one hit  matt doublecheck  taliesin yeah ill go for 
none	 it  matt spiritual weapon yep  taliesin thats 15  matt 15 unfortunately misses it swings and you can see the kobold look up as it sees your eyes  trace up and he goes growl sees it growl leaps backward as it slams into the ground  cracking the stone beneath and he dodges out of the way laughs  travis still with the performance issues eh bundle  taliesin im getting up and i use my movement to stand up and shake off  matt all right cool ending bundles turn thatll bring us to grendlemine  
none	 laura okay its greldamine  matt greldamine sorry reading my own handwritings a problem  laura are any of them in a line are they on the bridge still  matt on the bridge theres three on each bridge that are in a line  laura and then the big one  matt actually no at this point theres two because two of them got blown away theres two on  each bridge right now  laura okay and the big one is he lined up with a bridge or is he between the bridges  matt no hes in 
none	 between the two  laura okay  liam on other side  jennifer is greldamine still invisible  matt she is currently  liam whats the length of those bridge guesstimationwise  matt the bridges are about 20 feet across 15 to 20 theyre not super long bridges its not a  huge chamber  jennifer how many of them are left now we were down to eight  liam five total two on each bridge big guy other side big is relative term  laura okay for fear of damaging the perhaps bag of candles on the big ones 
none	 back that would be  bad im going to cast burning hands towards one of the bridges with two of the things on it  matt okay so you rush forward as two of the surviving kobolds on the right or the left  bridge  laura the left  matt okay so you run over to the left bridge and as the kobolds are rushing across with their  pickaxes out heavy breathing you  laura screams  matt you watch as her invisible form suddenly appears apparating as the illusion that has been  hiding her vanishes as 
none	 a flamethrower gout of fire burns out from in front engulfing both of  the kobolds whats the saving throw on that whats your dc your spell dc  laura my dc is 16  matt 16 no yes one of them succeeds one of them fails  laura okay  matt so whats the damage on that  laura 3d6 fire damage  matt so go ahead and roll 3d6  laura and it sets things on fire  matt yes the bridge is definitely on fire  laura nine damage  matt all right nine damage then one 
none	 of them takes four damage okay so theyre like ugh  they pull back a bit and you can see the edge of their whiskers are curling in and burned the  furs seared at the edges some of them actually have caught fire and a little bit of smoke is  pouring off but the edge of the bridge that theyre standing on that youre right in front  of has definitely caught fire and you can see the two kobolds are now trying to figure out what  to do as theyre stuck in the middle right now 
none	  laura im going to run away from the bridge and hide behind lohkors legs  matt you used your movement to approach the bridge to cast burning hands  laura oh i did great can i move at all  matt ill give you five feet  laura ill back up five feet  matt small steps their eyes are trained on you  laura shit  matt all right that ends your turn that brings it to their turn so as far as kobolds go the  two that are on the bridge start rushing towards you im 
none	 going to go ahead and see if the bridge  maintains its coherence for both of them for the first one its fine the second one it is not so  the first kobold runs forward and its going to swing at you with its pickaxe because you were  damaged by another kobold it gets a bonus to damage  laura i was oh i was  matt from the explosion earlier so that is going to be a 20 to hit  laura oh  matt i believe that hits right  laura and taliesin yeah  matt 
none	 all right and you suffer ten points of piercing damage as the pickaxe hacks into your  shoulder as it rushes past the other one as its running towards you you see it pulling back its  pickaxe to follow through and try and attack with its friend as the final ropes release and you  watch him go yells and vanish into the water below you hear him gurgles as he gets carried  by the water current further down the river and hes trying to swim upstream hes currently stuck  in the middle of trying to figure 
none	 out what to do there the other two rush across the other side of  the chamber finish traversing that bridge and go straight towards you lohkor because youre the  closest to them at this point thats going to be a 17 to hit  travis misses  matt you reach out and you parry off to the side the other ones going to go ahead and instead hes  going to thats a 22 to hit  travis that does hit  matt so you go ahead and suffer six points of piercing damage the first one you 
none	 deflect the  second one hits you jamming into one of the plates bending the armor and hitting you in the  side you feel your body tense from the severe pain but its nothing youve had worse  travis yeah just not the face  matt quazirat youre up  liam is there a clear path between where im standing and either bridge  matt well one bridge is currently collapsed the one on the right you could run through but you  would probably be getting attacked from both the kobolds that ran across and are blocking the 
none	 path  youd have to take an attack of opportunity from both of them  liam yeah that sounds fun im going to run for edge of bridge on this side how far is that for  me where im starting  matt id say its about 15 feet from you now  liam thats good i like it 15 feet is good i run towards edge  matt okay so you run to the edge you go past the two kobolds are you just running past them  liam yes  matt all right they both get attacks of 
none	 opportunity on you the first one is wow the  golden snitch is working for me now that is 21 to hit  liam sure that hits  matt that is seven points of piercing damage as the pickaxe swings and snags you in the back of  the shoulder blade the other one is a 17 to hit  liam no eat shit  matt that one scrapes across the back of your armor and makes no effective impact you continue  rushing across the bridge  liam no i used 15 feet to get here im going to 
none	 do my running long jump for 25 feet over 20 foot bridge  you describe to me and land on other side and move up to this asshole on other side  matt okay you cannot jump further than your movement speed technically so you run you jump  and youre getting right towards the edge there i would like you to go ahead and make an acrobatics  check  liam oh you think i would understand this mechanic before this moment in my life at level  seven what kind of check  matt this would be an 
none	 acrobatics check  liam okay oh not great at all but i get to add two because of remarkable athlete so hopefully  thats enough 14  matt 14 you were prepared you make your way through the air barely catch the edge of where  the other platform begins and you roll over the shoulder into it and as you come to stand youre  right there before the leader kobold whos there with his giant pack there ready as he has another  one of these sticks that hes currently trying to pull up to the candle on 
none	 his head what are you  going to do  liam im how far from him  matt youre right up against him  liam oh well im going to take his head off i had a pet rat but i dont care here we go oh  thats a one but i have an extra attack so i will go again oh thats so bad thats a 12  matt as you confidently grin your massive draenei body looking down upon this kobold who  looks like he got caught with his hand in the cookie jar you swing 
none	 wide with what weapon are  you using  liam im using greatsword  matt this giant twohanded cleaver that swings and the kobold goes hums  liam im going to attempt to embarrass myself further and use action surge  matt okay make two more attacks he dodges both of your swings  liam colville dont fuck me colville  matt its now laughing  liam 15 for the one  matt 15 just misses  liam but this last one is okay 17  matt 17 does hit  liam yes finally  matt he dodges the third 
none	 one and goes you have problem cant hit  liam oh fievel your troubles are just beginning that is ten slashing damage  matt ten slashing damage you take a chunk out of his shoulder this favorite shoulder  liam kiss my sword the hilt says leeron jenkins lets get this shit started  matt perfect ending your turn to the top it is your turn aerwin so there are now currently four  living kobolds well one of them has fallen into the river who is currently beneath the water  struggling against the current there is one that 
none	 is partially damaged that is currently up against  and fighting him actually no two of them that are up against fighting you and one thats up  against you  jennifer but this one also  matt yes theres the main leader across the way that hes currently up against  liam so you attack this guy you get sneak attack damage because i am right up against him  jennifer yes i want to do that  matt all right so youre taking another shot with your crossbow  jennifer yes  matt all right so you load 
none	 up another bolt and then aiming across the way making your way up  close to where the bridge is youll end up being in the melee range of the one thats fighting her  but you can still make the strike  liam acceptable risk  jennifer all right so i roll a d20  matt go ahead and roll your attack  liam whatd you get plus your crossbow  jennifer 19  matt 19 hits go ahead and roll damage plus sneak attack damage  liam so 1d6 to start then you add the other cubes okay 
none	 thats good  jennifer and then i add these guys okay 18  liam plus  jennifer 23  matt as the kobolds still laughing after the blows of your warrior friend swinging wide its  like its fun i take you with me its you watch as a crossbow bolt slinks right into where  the top of the clavicle in the kobolds neck is its reaching up to try and pull it out its  fingers look like its going numb and it looks hurt its holding on but its hurt thats a  nice slick shot so 
none	 youve made your movement you have a bonus action if you wanted to do  anything  jennifer well im right next to the one thats attacking her correct i think ill turn around  with the short sword  liam nope you cannot do that with bonus but is she up against any kobolds at the moment  matt shes right next to one thats been fighting her  liam well the best you could do with a bonus is maybe to disengage which means get away from them  so they cannot hurt you but you cannot hit 
none	 again with  jennifer okay ill disengage  laura yeah leave me alone next to it thank you thank you for the good advice  liam thats good advice just dance back a little bit  matt so with the five feet of your movement left you go ahead and step away using your bonus  action to disengage carefully stepping from the kobold as its going feral right now feeling  surrounded that ends your turn youre up lohkor  travis yeah i am over these guys right next to me warhammer that is a 22  matt 22 
none	 will definitely hit  travis that is 12 points of bludgeoning damage  matt 12 points of bludgeoning damage as it comes down the hammer slams into the chest area of one  of the kobolds thats harassing you it hits him and you hear this little squeak sound as the chest  cavity takes a very heavy blow still standing but its hurt  travis still standing eh round two that is a 25  matt that definitely hits go ahead and roll damage  travis another 12 points of bludgeoning damage  matt and with that you use 
none	 the momentum of pulling away to swing upward and from the  underhand to hit it snaps against the bottom of the kobolds jaw and you hear its neck cracks  from the impact and it falls onto its back as its legs curl back into its torso and its done  travis with my bonus action i turn and point to the last standing one my eye sees you  matt you swear you see a slight tinkle dribble down its leg all right that ends your turn at  this point the leader over there whos glaring at 
none	 you goes no ham has to finish his work and  hes going to go ahead and grab one of the yeah it regenerates rolled a five he pulls another  what you recognize now to be sticks of dynamite and looking at his pack you can see his pack is  filled it wasnt candles in that pack it is jamfilled with explosives and he goes rushing  past you you get an attack of opportunity on him  liam oh good yes hes got lots of candles yeah thats good thats 24  matt that hits go ahead 
none	 and roll damage  laura chop his head off  liam im trying its a ten  matt ten points of damage yells takes a heavy hit but continues rushing past the bridge area  then as hes rushing he lights it from the top of his head and chucks it in your guys direction  as it lands it detonates taking out lets see here damagewise everybody but you needs to go  ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw please  laura oh no this is bad  liam okay so you did quite good with 22 yeah 
none	  travis thats a one  matt 21 points of fire damage  laura 15  matt 15 just barely succeeds so you take 12 points of fire damage  taliesin yeah no  matt i said 21 right sorry so its ten points of fire damage 21 points of fire damage  jennifer 22  matt ten points of fire damage  liam does she have evasion  matt you do so you take nothing  liam zero because rogue is best class  matt so you seeing this coming you jump backwards grab the kobold thats in front 
none	 and  use him to shield you from the blast and he goes screams and scatters into ash as it manages to  detonate and explode the remaining kobolds in the area so all the kobolds that were with him have  all fallen to the ground now turned to ash or detonated in some way and you can see as the  leader of them is catching his breath across the bridge he goes oh no and he glances past with  his long gaze and you can look over at the other kobolds that had their own small 
none	 caches of  dynamite sticks some of which have been lit by the recent explosion that are rolling towards the  rock wall where you guys entered  travis weve got to go double dash all the way out  matt so you guys all start rushing towards where off the bridge  laura across the bridge right  matt all right so i need all of you guys to lets have everyone roll an initiative check right  now since technically the combat here is finished were going to do this as to see who can manage to  
none	 make it across before the explosion  travis its going to be an early night  taliesin whats the check again  matt just roll initiative  laura 19  travis four  taliesin god why am i rolling so bad ten  jennifer 16  liam 14  matt okay you were pretty much mostly fine across the bridge all of you go rushing past as  you see lohkor going huffing and explosion you see the whole room behind him light up you can  see a silhouette its fullon movie style explosion as you see it burn 
none	 past him you only  catch the edge of it which is good because you then only suffer eight points of fire damage but  you watch as the entrance you guys came through falls and collapses a series of boulders and  rocks the opposite end of the chamber falling in on itself part of the river you can see the  kobold thats barely clawing its way out of the water panting huh thud a rock hits and  smashes him across the bank part of the river fills in and you can see now the bank splashing 
none	  over and starting to try to make its way back but you guys are now on the opposite side of the  chamber its quiet you all take a minute to breathe look at your wounds youre a bit singed  around the way  travis im putting out the fire in my hair i use lay on hands to put out the fire  laura oh i forgot to do this and i cast mage armor on myself  travis before much better than after  taliesin im going to maybe do a prayer of healing also technically 
none	 speaking i have  disciple of light which means would everyone have gained an extra five points  matt they wouldve yes keep that in mind next time well say for now you guys all wouldve  healed an additional five points of damage because he is really good at healing as a priest  liam you want to take like five or maybe even 20 minutes here before we go forward  travis i mean were hot on the trail  laura why do we need to do that  liam i dont know you know conserving energy that 
none	 kind of thing lets go you want to kick  ass i can tell little one lets go  jennifer im with her i will now call her small and brave im with small and brave sb for short  taliesin i cant do prayer of healing while were walking though can i its just verbal  matt is it the ten minute one you have to sit still for ten minutes to do it  taliesin ten minutes to heal everybody up a bit so thats 2d8 plus my spellcasting ability  modifier  travis thats not long enough 
none	 for hit dice and stuff though  matt so roll 2d8 plus your wisdom modifier  taliesin oh my god really  matt double ones  taliesin yep  travis you gave the golden snitch away taliesin this is the beginning of the end  laura did he really  liam he tossed it at the dm  taliesin so thats nine points of healing to everybody  matt still good all of you guys heal nine points thats not bad  jennifer okay so we already added the five but we dont get the five  matt nine on 
none	 top of that  jennifer nine more on top of the five okay  matt as bundle finishes the prayer of healing and you all feel your wounds begin to close and stitch  themselves together you see a little bit of movement at the edge of the banks between the  rock that had plummeted into it you watch as a tiny hand climbing out of the water you see a  very bloodied smashed one eye swollen kobold  laura can i use firebolt at it  travis no dont you want to ask maybe what they were 
none	 doing down here or what their plans might  be  laura oh i mean sure if that sounds good to you  travis i think it might be wise  laura im a rage monster i just like to kill things  travis i know that about you  jennifer thats why shes my new best friend  laura go for it  travis can i go over and pick it up by the back of the neck  matt squeals  travis hello friend before i let one of these fine people  matt as hes scrambling right

none	 we need to go through door  jennifer should we secure him  laura if you want  taliesin weve got rope  travis just so we make sure you dont break your other hand shes going to make sure that youre  secure  matt okay  jennifer do i need to roll something for that  matt no easy enough he waits for you you have rope on you  jennifer i do i have rope  matt okay so you go ahead and you bind him up and you have a little leash that youre holding

none	  matt whines  jennifer hearts next to it  laura whats your name  matt reeksus  laura reeksus you got it  matt open door  travis through the door then  liam and i kick him really hard in the ass lead the way  matt the door is closed  liam lead the way  matt im bound you made me put rope on it  travis is there a latch a door knob  matt there is a handle latch and it looks like there is a lock mechanism to it  travis hmm a 
none	 lock  jennifer whose purview is this  liam thats you you take look make sure it does not explode on you  jennifer i dont see any wicks i dont see anything explosive  matt make an investigation check if you want to check for traps  jennifer oh 25  taliesin what did you roll well she rolled a 20  laura thats important  matt very nice its a lock mechanism a relatively simple lock it is not trapped so you  could easily undo this with your thieves tools  jennifer so i do something so 
dung	 i can do that  matt yep so you roll another d20 and then add your proficiency modifier and your dexterity  modifier  liam this plus this so plus eight to what you roll  jennifer so that is 14  matt easy enough the door unlocks opens a bit and beyond that is a tunnel of darkness an  interesting smell hits you as you open it though whereas inside here you have that damp  hardwater pirates of the caribbean ride smell thats in the water chamber beyond that as the  door opens this musty almost 
none	 mildewed smell hits you its earthy its fresh its natural but  its definitely an underground familiar smell  jennifer why can we never encounter a field of flowers  laura should i light up a rock again  taliesin oh i can do it so i pick up a rock and light it up and toss it in front of us just keep  kicking it down  matt it lights up the chamber as it goes and you continue to walk and kick it as you push forward  the walls begin to slowly glow the further in 
none	 you go you begin to notice that aside from a few  small crystalline areas there are heavy bits of fungus that are beginning to appear along these  chambers glowing green orange blue mushrooms and clusters of fungal matter that are beginning  to give this faint luminescence to the interior of the chamber and you now very much understand  where the smell was coming from as you begin to curve around the right side of it the tunnel  widens a little broader to about 15 feet wide the mushrooms begin to get larger and larger some 
none	 of  them four feet tall or bigger you can see large pillar stalactites and stalagmites are meeting in  the center where they give their own little offshoots of fungus but some of these are getting  very big and the pathways are getting a little narrow to move past until as you turn around one  of the right bends the fungus is pushed around to the point where its a very narrow passage to push  through these fungal forests  liam i dont like mushrooms  laura theyre quite tasty actually  taliesin could make a 
none	 glowing salad of some kind  laura ooh yeah hey reeksus  matt yeah  laura i give him a little bit of beef jerky okay do you want to go in front of us and lead  the way to your king  matt okay and he carefully turns to his side and thins up and slowly with disadvantage  because hes bound still effectively manages to squiggle his way between the small path and you  can see he knows it pretty well through the small cluster of dense tall fungus safely to the other  side  
none	 laura is it bad to touch it  matt i would not recommend it  liam and the rope is still trailing from him  matt yeah its 30 feet of slack rope its on the ground over there  travis if only we had some fire  laura oh do you want me to set these on fire because i have some i mean is it safe to burn  what if it sets off a poison when theyre on fire ive heard that burning mushrooms could get you  you know  travis eating mushrooms  laura oh 
none	 its not fumes  taliesin liam and travis no  laura oh i wouldnt know they dont allow that kind of stuff at mage school okay im going to  go through wait am i going to burn it im going to get to the other side and then im going to try  to burn it i dont want to burn reeks okay i go to the other side  matt okay go ahead and make a straight dexterity check please  laura all right woohoo what is that 18 or 19 18 plus dexterity 21  matt following 
none	 suit you deftly follow the same pattern and come out the other side not even  touching any of the fungus with either side of your armored shoulder pauldrons your mantle i guess  it would be  laura should i try to burn them now what do you guys think  liam depends on what we think biggest threat is touching mushroom breathing mushroom  jennifer should we test it first touch it to test it to see if it affects us  travis im afraid they might release spores and then become airborne which is why i only 
none	 recommend  trying to burn it first  jennifer that would release a lot of spores  liam how far away can you cast that shit from  laura its ranged about eight i dont know what that means  matt is this burning hands  laura no fire bolt  matt oh fire bolt oh its a pretty decent range just a single hit yeah  liam what if we all back up to our different sides yeah get back as far as you can and well  get way the fuck back see what happens  laura and 
none	 then ill hit it because i can do cantrips a lot right  matt cantrips you can do as many times as you want  laura fuck i mean heck yeah im going to do  travis they dont let cursing happen in mage school either  laura they dont curse in mage school im sorry about that  matt yeah theyre real tough on that in dalaran  laura they smack your hands ill tell you that much  matt they wouldnt tell you but madame had a potty mouth  laura im going to cast fire bolt at 
none	 the mushrooms that gives me 2d10 fire damage  matt yes even with a singular bolt the mushrooms pretty big and its not moving its  pretty easy to hit you hit the first one a while away and as it impacts you watch as the flames  burn up immediately the strange subtle squeaking sound releases as it shakes and shimmies and you  watch as spores filter out and then ignite from the nearby flames that immediately destroy the  cloud before it can emerge and the fungus slowly withers and crumples over  laura okay good i 
none	 do the same thing on all of the mushrooms that are along the path  matt okay one by one you create this pathway destroying the fungus on the opposite side are  you still holding the rope  laura yes  matt okay as the flames begin  laura but i went through remember i went through and im holding the rope on my side  matt right so as youre destroying these the rope pulls a little taut to your side as you begin  clearing the path and you look over and you can see your friend 
dung	 is peeking around a rock you can  see this glow on the other side of a boulder around the bend where hes looking over and looks  back at you and is like  laura what  matt mutters  laura hold on  matt okay the rest of you guys there is a path wide enough to follow through  travis we join  laura theyre coming okay i go over to reek  matt as you guys approach you can see the small flickering of light shift suddenly and a dark  shape of a figure whips 
none	 around from behind the rock you see a flash of cloth that floats open  and then drifts down to the side as an arm uncurls you can see immediately wideshouldered  a broad long trench coat that swings open to one side a clawed familiar slightly furred hand  holding it open as a brownish hat widebrimmed appears with its candle placed on top of the brim  you see another kobold standing there looking at your tiedup friend and the rest of you and he  goes hey hey want to buy a fungus as you look on 
none	 the inside of the cloak you can see these  little patchwork pouches of different gathered mushrooms orange green and blue i sell good  price come buy  taliesin well  laura well what do they do  matt taste good ugh bad good bad fun  laura i dont understand what he just told me  liam i mean to begin with youre not alarmed by us being here in the first place  matt i need to make money  taliesin lets not look a gift horse in the mouth a gift rat orange  matt orange 
none	 fungus slight citrusy taste weird fuzzy sensation 40 gold  taliesin and the other two were  travis what about blue  matt blue fungus 30 gold make for good digestion tract  travis ill take the blue one  laura you have that much gold  travis yeah  matt you now have a helping of blue fungus  taliesin whats the third  matt green fungus 25 gold more of the onion of fungus family  laura thats a good topping  matt yeah  liam i grab rope that is holding reekcheeks and bring him over you 
none	 know this one  matt he is strange one dont like him i dont kobolds stay away  liam is he problem  matt whispering i dont know  laura you be nice to him  travis its the theyre real  liam i punch him in the eye  matt cry of pain  taliesin you only live once orange  liam youve got to keep them in line with tough love  taliesin i take the orange  matt all righty  travis do i know anything about this blue fungus  matt make a medicine check  
dung	 laura its good for digestion i hear  travis 16  matt 16 okay  taliesin oh 20  matt okay so eating this fungus has a chance of poisoning you but also has the opportunity to  heighten your senses and perceptive capabilities for a short time  laura ooh its a gamble  taliesin how about mine  matt so thats the orange one you got the  taliesin i have the orange  matt youve got the orange  laura yeah he got the blue  matt he got the blue sorry yeah so the blue one 
none	 has a faint possibility of poisoning you  sorry youre the blue the orange one is the one you got so you get the heightened senses yours  has a chance of poisoning you as well and or has the possibility of healing some hit points  taliesin down the hatch  matt all right both of you make constitution saving throws  liam give it to mikey hell try anything  travis now because youre next to me i have aura of protection which is plus two to saves  matt yeah it would  taliesin oh that helps 
none	 because my constitutions really low  travis yes 21  taliesin eight  matt okay so youre poisoned for the next hour  the poisoned status means all of your attacks are at disadvantage and your ability  checks are at disadvantage as well so you have advantage on all perception and investigation  checks for the next hour  liam everything is crystal clear  matt yeah your eyes dilate suddenly and i know kungfu  travis yeah show me  matt bundle you heal six hit points  taliesin i heal six  laura ooh at least it 
none	 healed you while it poisoned you  taliesin im also going to cast lesser restoration and make the poison go away  matt okay so the poison vanishes from your system at which point the kobold mushhuckster  max thanks you now off to find new ventures pulls the cloak in front of his head and darts  away on little ninja feet back through the mushrooms and vanishes into darkness  taliesin its weird hes selling mushrooms to random people in caverns like that  travis i highly recommend the blue fungus  liam in another life i would 
none	 have hit that guy before he said a single word i would have dropped  his ass  travis somehow i know that to be true about you  matt at this point you hear a strange guttural growl from the path that you were traveling near a  pillar of stone encased in mushrooms as from around one back of it you see a shape of a large  hunched bestial dwarf apelike creature standing at about six and a half feet tall as its long arms  drag on the ground its drooling down its own chest youve 
none	 experienced most of you in particular  this is a trogg a large subterranean creature but this trogg is acting strange its giggling to  itself deep laughter holds the pillar and grabs some mushroom and scarfs it  laura oh no  jennifer here we go  matt grunts and he starts walking around the edge looks around the edge right to you its  real  taliesin jennifer and laura no  matt make a persuasion check  taliesin come on natural 20 about fucking time there we are no  matt too weird i see things you 
none	 see two other large troggs come from behind going theyre  tripping balls one of them is currently clutching a long staff of purple and gold inlay and is  gnawing on it like a large lollipop you cant see the top because its jammed in his mouth theyre  all looking at you going laughing  taliesin im going to use thaumaturgy to make us all look really fuzzy in and out if i can do  that  matt you may  taliesin ooh  matt no okay they all stand there and watch groaning one of them 
none	 picks his nose slowly  taliesin i hadnt thought this through  laura i use prestidigitation and create light flares around him  matt one elbows one in the chin the guy who was holding the staff he elbows him the chest  gagging pulls it out you can see on the top of the staff it has these awesome pointed purple  stones three of them in a triangular pattern that float locked into place licking jams it back  in his mouth and begins chewing on it again  taliesin can i make the staff look like its 
none	 made of snakes or something can i thaumaturgy  matt unfortunately thats an illusion spell thaumaturgy is very simple its a very faint  effect that wouldnt have an effect if they werent already tripping balls  laura if theyre already tripping can we say whoa why are you holding that snake in your  hand  matt make a persuasion check  laura please oh no 11  matt 11 he goes gags pulls it out looks at it hey a snake and begins trying to bite  through you watch as his teeth are breaking on the metal 
none	  travis ill cast command on him and say drop that wicked snake  matt okay whats your spell dc  travis 13  matt he rolled a 13 minus one this trogg is not very wise drops it you see hes putting his  tongue through his mouth and bits of teeth are falling out of his lips and bouncing off of his  belly grunts theyre all currently entranced by the movement and the lights that youve created  jennifer id love to collect the thing  matt make a stealth check to see if you can not 
none	 gather their gaze as theyre currently entranced  by this  travis were doing our best outside inflatable people  jennifer 21  matt 21 you slowly subtly go beneath their eyeline slip out and pull the staff away as  theyre all still gasping one of them begins picking his ear pulls something out and eats  it  groaning  laura we should back away slowly  matt farts  taliesin oh slowly okay  laura reeks if we leave them will you keep guiding the way  matt behind them the way is where they came from 
none	  travis quazi feel like introducing yourself  liam good news my brothers we come from both the future and the past  matt all three of them grunt  liam let me tell you your fathers are proud of you  matt the two on the sides look in to the one in the center who goes you know father  liam ive been this fucked up before your mothers love you and are proud of you  matt make a persuasion check  liam persuasion you said thats 18  matt 18 his giant meaty furcovered hands clap 
none	 onto your shoulders of your armor and pulls you in  close you can smell the horrible trogg breath billow out across your face almost thickens the  air around you it smells of rotting meat and a multitude of terrible memories  liam and the deep secret is you know that i am you  matt he releases you and takes a step back and goes sobbing and starts sobbing openly the two  other troggs clap the side of his shoulders and start sobbing too the three of them sit in place  and start having the most 
none	 basic of existential crises you could watch  taliesin slowly making our way around the existential crisis  matt the rest of you make a stealth check you already made one the rest of you make a stealth  check  liam doing inches this way like an arc and papa and mama dont want you to hurt you you have to  love you  matt you get the sense theyre picking up every third word due to the limits of their language  comprehension theyre like grunting love grunting ove sobbing guh theyre just  making guttural noises 
none	 at this point  liam give into it  matt make a stealth check please  liam oh thats a 20  matt as you guys slowly curve around the three sobbing troggs staff in hand you exit through  the tunnel they had passed through the fungus begins to give way as the heat begins to rise  steadily once you traverse further into this tunnel youre holding the staff as youre  walking looking over it a slow voice beings to peek in seemingly from nowhere it says oh  wondrous another unworthy soul i command you to 
none	 throw me into a river and be done with it  jennifer hmm first you must tell us your secrets  matt i require a wielder who walks the path of power fool  laura whats it saying  jennifer it requires a wielder who walks the path of power fool  laura magic  jennifer im not calling you a fool its calling you a fool magic  laura i do magic  jennifer take him  matt as you take the staff it warms to your touch for a moment theres an awkward silence  of did she 
none	 actually hear anything or has your friend been crazy the whole time youve been  traveling  jennifer both  matt a voice slowly echoes in ah you you have potential a withered seed that could blossom into  a tyrant of the arcane  laura well im pretty blossomed already but okay  matt yes you will do i am aluneth and together we will do great things and thats  where were going to take a break  travis ooh youve got sentient weapons in this thing the little gems are floating in a  triangle  matt

none	 to you asap also i was just notified that the chat had discovered back when vanilla  launch happened i was one of the people waiting at the midnight launch of world of warcraft  outside of a cold best buy in irvine many years ago and started my long trek on the rp server  silverhand at launch i discovered today via fatalcake23 in the chat that there is both a vox  machina and a slayers take guild on the server i started on which is so weird and full circle  yeah we used to play on 
none	 that server  taliesin yeah you dragged me onto silverhand  matt yeah so thats kind of cool so hi everybody on silverhand and those guilds and  beyond  taliesin and matt its been a while  liam we are such fake nerds  travis and taliesin totes fake  travis i just want to go deadlift right now  jennifer i aspire to nerd  matt you aspire what  jennifer i aspire to nerd  matt all right so as we come back in you have acquired  laura yay should i read it out loud  
none	 matt if youd like to  laura i have acquired aluneth this ancient extremely powerful staff was once owned by  aegwynn egwin agewin  matt sure  laura the only female guardian of tirisfal this staff carries a mind far more ancient than most  things in azeroth my spell attack rolls gain a 3 to hit whenever i deal damage i deal two  additional hit points of force damage thats amazing  matt as youre clutching the staff as it speaks to you in your mind together we will do great  things but you must survive 
none	 so be smart stay alive and perhaps ditch these unnecessary  dregs  laura theyre pretty cool actually well some of them  travis whos cool  laura what  taliesin well im cool  laura what are you talking about  liam what are you doing did you eat mushrooms  travis you said theyre pretty cool  liam you were talking out loud to no one  laura oh no its the staff it has a voice  jennifer what did it say i heard it  laura it said that im really amazing and that im going 
none	 to do good things i think that its  like a really powerful weapon its like the kind of thing you take with you for several levels at  least  taliesin how did we agree that you get the epic loot drop  travis staff of flirting  jennifer he wouldnt speak to me im too tall  laura thats probably what it is  liam i think its your own positive nature speaking to you from yourself  laura thats possible my mama and papa are very proud of me  liam i mean thats up to you 
none	 and them i dont know shit about that  jennifer is he you  laura is it a he i dont know  jennifer is he you  laura oh him not staff im confused  matt your perceptive night elf sense picks out the air becoming more sulfurous as you progress  you all begin to feel a bit uncomfortable in your armor as the temperature gets warmer and warmer  as this tunnel descends slightly and then comes to an abrupt leveling point you can see a faint  orange glow begin to fill the chamber before you 
dung	 as the pathway opens up to a large cavernous  dome the floor of this new chamber is cracked with dark soot and brittle black rock the room  seems to maintain its own atmospheric reddishorange glow across the entirety of the  roof roughly 30 feet into this chamber you get a glance at the source of light as the rocky floor  suddenly drops off into a river of roiling molten magma the heat at this point is extremely  intense causing you to squint as you back away from the edge theres a series of pillars that 
none	  rise from the lava into platforms in fact it looks like at one point two wide stone bridges  that were perpendicular meeting in the center once reached across this lava field both from  where you stand and then one on two opposite ends of this cavern where you can see openings on the  opposite end to the right of where you are and then to the left it appears a portion of it has  collapsed and closed it off these bridges however through time and erosion have fallen in  parts and to give you 
none	 a visual perspective of what youre glancing at you entered from this  chamber these are the existing platforms still the shaded elements represent ones that are down  in the lava and resting there theres a slight alcove over here theres a number of dotted bits  here and here this appears to have collapsed and theres an opening here and an opening here  youre currently on this platform  taliesin see this would have been an appropriate place to build bridges that are kind of iffy two  of them even  laura yeah hey reeks  
none	 matt what  laura which direction is your king  matt uh and he bends forward and tries to get one hand up and the finger goes like  laura hey look your hands are working again  matt ow  laughter  liam mind over matter  matt they mostly just let me through  laura oh okay well well figure it out  travis now now you know king tagwaggle will be very disappointed  matt togwaggle  travis togwaggle will be very disappointed if we are not brought before him  matt wait across and the finger 
none	 the broken hand tries to lift up across i remember that  way that way to togwaggle  laura straight across  matt yes  taliesin i want to take a quick insight check and give him an eye i dont trust this one thats  not bad thats a 16  matt 16 kind of hard to read you get the sense that something doesnt sit right with the way hes  saying it  liam aerwin do you see anything hinky in this room anything off bad  matt you can make a perception check if you like 
none	  jennifer id like to make a perception check  travis can i join her with my heightened senses from my blue fungi  matt you may with advantage  liam whats that okay thats 16 plus perception  jennifer so 23  travis 18  matt all right so as you both glance over you notice the part thats collapsed and taken down  that portion of the bridge there is no way through it is completely sealed off you both  notice simultaneously on the central cross platform in the center of the chamber where you  see 
none	 across the broken center theres a bunch of scraps of metal empty shells of armor  plates that have been left there and have long been covered in dust and soot you notice with  your fair vision that the small alcove on the far end of the upper corner thats down near the  surface of the lava it appears to be two figures lying down in the shadows there you cant make  out much more detail than that but there appears to be two humanoid entities that are currently  resting on that platform  laura theyre 
none	 laying a trap ill bet you anything  jennifer we need to get closer  taliesin with darkvision could i see them  matt at this distance no youll probably have to get closer to the central platform to get a  better view  taliesin all right im going to try and go for the central platform  laura wait but you just said theres a big pile of metal in the middle and two creatures hiding  what if theyre waiting to explode the middle  liam and were standing here talking in this chamber  jennifer could 
none	 i take some of my ball bearings and go across i have my ball bearings in my  pocket to trip them and go across and try to get closer  matt you could throw them out in front of you to try and see if it hits them  jennifer no ill have them with me in case i need them as a defense can i sneak across to see  them  matt okay so you pull out your small pouch of ball bearings hold them in your hand go and make  a stealth check  liam 
none	 thats good youre going to be good  jennifer 23  matt thats not bad you have to leap across to get to the smaller platform thats going up  because there are the breaks in it whats your strength ten  jennifer zero  matt right so maximum ten so you get about a 10foot jump across that way its about a 10foot  jump to get to that smaller platform you keeping low using the balls of your feet make a leap for  it just catching the edge ever so carefully if you can make an acrobatics 
none	 check to use your  momentum to tumble onto it  liam acrobatics you say  jennifer 12 total  matt 12 okay you barely use your momentum to not tumble backward towards the molten rock below  using your shoulder you roll and using your momentum you come to the other side of that and  leap a second time towards that other side of that platform i need you to make one more check for  me  jennifer 13  matt 13 all right so you leap tumble and you make your way across the platform as 
none	 you stand  there looking around you get a quick glance down into that little alcove below as you take in the  circumstance you see there there are two figures they are armored they are lying down  and they are skeletal they are long burned away the flesh is gone they long died there either  they were trapped and couldnt find a way out and slowly starved or dehydrated but theres nothing  but a pile of their equipment their weapons their armor and bone at this point the floor  below you gently rumbles a bit 
none	 and you watch as some of the metal scraps scrape across the ground  on their own they leap up into the air and form bracers some sort of large thick pieces of  armor separate as molten rock shoots up and flame ignites filling the center of the empty  armor into a large elementallike enemy made of fire and magma within the armor you watch as this  magma rager appearing giving this flexing roar goes charging towards you what are you doing  jennifer am i doing this  matt well youre definitely not hidden from it 
none	 yet you have to hide first  jennifer okay strength is not my thing i think im going to run  matt okay so you run back the opposite direction leap head across the way go ahead and  make an acrobatics check  jennifer 22  matt fine you spin roll off your shoulder leap a second time on the other side and make  one more acrobatics check  jennifer 16  matt not a problem you make it across to the other side and you watch as this large raging  elemental stops at the edge scoots 
none	 back and stands there waiting on the center platform  jennifer well at least now we know  laura thats intimidating what about the two things laying in wait were they setting a trap  jennifer they were skeletons they were done they were dead  laura they were undead  jennifer theyre dead  laura just dead  jennifer they were regular dead  liam well thats iffy you know but also tempting because what did they have when they  died  laura we should definitely check it out  liam i can chuck you over  laura 
none	 but theres a giant flame monster  liam well yeah first one thing then the other  laura how are we going to beat him  travis i could stun him  laura you think that would work  travis might wed have to be fast and no one could fall  liam im not going to fall  travis why did you think i was saying that you would fall  liam you were staring straight at me  travis was i  liam oh yes  travis one of us could fall  liam now you seem sarcastic 
none	 because youre rolling your eyes  laura im not very good at jumping but i can cast fly on myself  jennifer gasps she is invisible she has invisibility  travis yeah i think we have to get to did you trust skeever  laura reeks  travis yeah  laura well hey thats a good point reeks  matt yes  laura why didnt you warn us about the giant monster in the middle there  matt sorry i forgot  laura did you  matt yes  laura what happened to your voice  matt what  jennifer 
none	 did they die from the monster in the middle because they are on the far side or did  they die trying to get out that entrance because it is not really an entrance  laura thats deep maybe they just fell and they couldnt climb back up  travis they had to have gotten there for a reason right  liam there are these big bruisers floating there staring at us  matt just staring at you yeah  liam you can fly  laura yeah  liam i have seen you do it so many times cant you 
none	 skirt the edge of this room and go over there  you dont need to go through this guy  laura over to the alcove  liam sure see if there is anything worth you know this is what we live for  laura i can try  travis fly fly away fly far away  liam i am not going too much hassle  matt be careful its dangerous big fire thing  laura okay what did you say  matt big fire thing  laura yeah how do you make him go back to sleep  matt dont 
none	 let him know you came  laura okay tell you what lohkor will you hold his leash please  travis sure  laura im going to fly i know exactly how to do it  matt you cast it on yourself its a concentration for i believe up to an hour  laura ten minutes  matt ten minutes even better  laura sure yeah im going to fly and im going to try to go over to that little alcove and see  what happens  matt all right so you watch as the tiny gnome suddenly takes off 
none	 and begins gliding across the  roof of this magma area  laura and im giving the creature a wide berth  liam look laura youre finally doing it  matt as youre doing it you watch as the magma rager stares and tracks her as she goes and as  you head across the way it shifts to the very edge of the platform almost tensing at the border  and watches as you slowly descend towards this platform as you come down make a perception  check  laura 17  matt glancing you look down yeah they 
none	 are charred and long dead the armor appears to be  burned away there are a few pieces of equipment that have lasted okay although covered in black  soot theres a couple of small satchels that are left there and looks like they were back to back  just hoping for help or trying to find a way off and eventually they expired  laura im sorry you had a tragic ending im going to keep flying around them i dont want to  touch my feet to the ground in case something comes out of the ground but 
none	 im going to dig  through all of their shit and see what i can find  matt make an investigation check  travis wow one  laura goodbye  matt okay glancing through most of it falls apart as you grasp it the armor crumples and  falls apart as you touch the armor the only thing that catches your attention because it is the one  piece of equipment that is shining amongst the rest is in one of the sheaths there is a blade  that as you pull it out its got this beautifully wicked metal 
none	 that curves into a point at the end  like a forked point its got a bit of an energy pulse gem in the center of where the hilt is and  as you reach over to look at it it looks pristine untouched by time burps pardon me a little  effervescent tonight apparently the soot wipes off of it cleanly  laura i hold it aloft i found a weapon ill bring it back over to you guys  liam i also talk to you  matt at this point aluneth does whisper and say youve already found 
none	 a weapon this is of no use  to you  laura im not going to keep it im going to give it away  matt good the sooner the better goes silent you watch as coasting over blade forth the magma  rager still tensing against the edge as she flies overhead  laura i wave it towards the creature as i fly by but i dont get close enough to really do  anything  matt greldamine finally lands on the ground presenting the blade  liam what kind of blade how big is this thing  matt 
none	 its a longsword its big for a longsword but it does technically act as a longsword  laura which one of you would like this beautiful blade  travis i would like to see it  liam i would also but i would do roshambo with you  travis yep  liam okay best out of three or just one time  travis one time throw on four  liam on four i have intelligence of eight  travis throw on three  liam throw on three  travis throw on one  liam why are you changing it on

none	 the voice comes back in from the aether i do despise these subterranean regions i dont  recognize where we are this world has changed quite a bit since i last walked its surface  laura yes  jennifer how long since you walked its surface  laura how long since you walked its surface i mean i know ive heard about aluneth before  its very ancient  matt of course you have i dont know generations  laura long time  taliesin could you fly over to the  matt do you wish to attune to the weapon 
none	  liam hell yeah i am attuned to nothing so i will attune to this  laura you want me to go over to the collapse  taliesin yeah lead the creature over to that section  laura oh okay im going to fly over to the collapsed area because ive still got a little  time left right  matt okay so you coast over to the collapsed area  laura and i land now what do you want me to do  taliesin im going to try and cast hold person on the creature  laura wait ill 
none	 wave my arms so he walks toward me  matt make an intelligence check  taliesin god it wont work on him will it  matt yeah so the creature heads over and its focused on you whatd you get  taliesin i got 20  matt 20 you get the sense that hold person mainly affects small humanoid creatures a large  elemental like this would not be held by a spell  laura is an elemental considered a monster  matt its considered a monster  travis creature though  matt so you discovered your weapon  liam 
none	 yes this was made for me should i be describing this to the table yes this is called  adventurefury blessed blade of the thrillseeker this weirdly pristine longsword is encased in  meticulous almost gaudy gold scrolling and runelike carvings that spell out phrases like  carpe diem like your shirt with donut and you only live once you gain plus two to all attacks  and damage rolls made with this weapon you are immune to fear and if you ever attempt to flee  from danger you must make a wisdom saving throw dc 12 on a 
none	 failure you instead rush toward the  challenge in hopes of glory yolo  travis yes thats a great item  matt its adventurefury blessed blade of the thrillseeker  travis oh my god damn  laura is that an actual blade in the game  matt chuckling no  laura please make it an actual weapon in the game  matt its an inside joke  liam for argus and for lrjenkins1234  travis i could try to stun him if we all wanted to make a break for one side or the other im not  sure if 
none	 it would work so any other ideas  jennifer which side  laura straight through i think i mean thats what reek said  travis wasnt reek lying  laura no hes very trustworthy  jennifer i think theres something on the other side that we dont know we need to know  travis i cast zone of truth  matt okay whats your spell dc oh 13 right nope  laura yay  travis cheeker whats his name oh right reek  matt reeksus  travis do you really know the way back to tagwaggle  matt i do 
none	 yes  travis which direction is it  matt that would be straining right  laura he lied to me  travis he did im sure its nothing personal though  matt im bad with directions  laura hes telling the truth do you like us aww do you like me  travis no he has to answer  matt i endure you  laura ill take it  matt i endure you  liam hey shakira do you fear me  matt panicked wimper  liam good thats all that matters lets go  laura i think im running 
none	 out of my ten minutes  matt youre getting down to the last couple of minutes  laura i need to stand up and i need to fly away from this place or else im going to be stranded  on this side  taliesin you can land wherever we need to be  laura yeah thats what im going to do but i want to fly around to the other side  matt okay so you coast around to this platform over here and land on the opposite side of the  bridge the magma rager spins and is 
none	 flexing in the direction of where you are  travis while the zone of truth is still active bundle what are you the most afraid of  matt make a wisdom saving throw  taliesin oh thats a 24  matt answer as you feel  taliesin not you not even a little youre so soft and squishy  travis no see if it was a spider then i could take care of it for you i dont want to leave you  in an awkward situation  jennifer should we leave you two alone  taliesin no  matt 
none	 yes  taliesin well you only live once  laura what are you going to do  travis do it  taliesin im going to make a run for it fuck it  matt whats your strength  taliesin my strength is 16  matt 16 thats easy enough for you you run and leap big dwarven strong legs you leap across you  land on the center platform at which point the magma rager turns to face you what are you  doing  taliesin im going to cast sacred flame which i know will do very little on 
none	 him but it might  temporarily irritate him im going to run the opposite direction  matt okay sacred flame so he makes a dexterity saving throw no its an action to do that  taliesin oh its an action to do that should i burn my action running  matt to dash you can if you want to okay you go running as it goes charging toward you its  going to go ahead and attempt to make a chargeslam attack that is going to be a 23 to  hit  taliesin oh my god yeah that hits 
none	  matt double ones on the attack so only six points of bludgeoning damage  taliesin i can live with that  matt six points of fire damage  taliesin i can live with that too  matt as it slams into you you immediately get pushed 15 feet back into the air you arc  backwards as youre falling back you can look youre edging toward where the central platform  where you were before you go to the middle one and off to the side where the lava is go ahead  and make an acrobatics check  
none	 taliesin god if i have to do an action i hope i can get an action before this happens acrobatics  check oh god  travis whyd you give the snitch back  taliesin because im an idiot 20  matt 20 you barely manage to catch yourself on the edge and roll back up straining onto the  platform the magma rager is right there staring at you its burning coal magma eyes angrily  staring at your dwarven form  taliesin so where am i now  matt you are now currently right here in the center yeah 
none	  laura oh he ran backwards  matt he slammed into him as he ran toward him and pushed him back onto the middle platform at least  he didnt fall in  laura okay i have an idea is he considered fighting us right now or is he just staring  matt i mean in theory it cant seemingly do anything at you from range so hes waiting for  somebody to come to his platform if you decide to then assault him on the middle platform thered  be an initiative roll but right now it doesnt seem 
none	 to have any means of attacking at range  laura okay then im going to cast charm monster on the creature  matt okay so this is your 4thlevel  laura it is  matt it rolled a four so it does not succeed  laura woo you love us were really great let us pass  matt you watch as its intense expression toward the dwarf slackens and it flexes its shoulders and  then roils back to the center platform and then looks over toward you with a nod  laura your mama loves you very much your 
none	 papas very proud of you come on you guys  travis doesnt seem so scary across  matt all right so your strength your strength whats your strength  jennifer ah zero or ten sorry ten  laura nobody attack him guys if anybody touches him this is going to break  matt yeah so the three of you make it across fine without any issue go ahead and make an  acrobatics check for me  liam 20 natural 20  matt ill let that go for all of them with a natural 20 seeing this happen and watching 
none	 them  all dart across you begin to do handoverfeet fullon handspringstyle leaping over the  platforms past the rager you all make it over to the side platform meeting up with your mage  friend as the magma ragers still sitting there resting in the center looking toward you for some  sort of an order  travis i did have reeksus with me  matt screeching impact hes being dragged and slammed like some horrible slowmotion yoyo  taliesin i did a quick cure wounds back to 41  laura can you talk magma monster  matt you 
none	 hear it emitting some sort of sound but it sounds like a heavy bonfire and rocks banging  together  laura you know what friends do they dance friends dance with each other we should dance  matt so as you step up to the edge of the platform begin to gnomedance the rager  liam is it the warcraft dancing animation  laura yeah  matt theres this large elemental covered in armor thats pseudogetting down with this tiny  mage gnome on the edge of the platform as the lava glows from underneath uplighting him  laura i 
none	 guess we can go you guys see you later  matt as you walk away it slowly stops dancing and goes back to rest in the center of the  platform all righty that was a unique solution  travis reeksus now that your lies are through lead the way quietly  liam we are problem solvers  matt quietly is the key here shh  liam aw i dont feel bad why is that  matt big thing lives ahead  liam not toddlewaddle something else  matt togwaggle beyond this is big dragon  liam what did you 
none	 say  matt dragon  travis i have actually not gone up against a dragon i just want to put that out there  taliesin theyre not bad well i mean i hear theyre not bad  laura have you ever seen a dragon in person  taliesin no no i mean well no well no  travis reeksus one dragon just one  matt one dragon not too bad for you right  laura have you ever seen a dragon  jennifer yes well my grandfather he told me tales of them yes  laura okay  jennifer we 
none	 choose the shadows in the presence of dragons  travis yes lets stealth for a minute  matt as you guys press down through the darkened grade the heat subsides slightly you feel the  breeze now this pulsing breeze through the tunnel rhythmic almost as you turn into an open  cavern a magnificent natural pocket of geodes and crystals beautiful blue and green crystals  refracting patches of luminous fungus into these faint kaleidoscopes that permeate the entirety of  this entryway theres a visible exit across the chamber and slightly to the left where you can  
none	 see in the middle is a glittering mass piles upon piles of gold coins punctuated by gems of all  colors peeking through this hoard as you enter and look about it is more money than any of you  have ever seen there atop this mound you see lying the gargantuan curled form of a sleeping  red dragon arms crossed head resting there snoring  jennifer creature hasnt acted in combat yet  liam yeah but i have to share speaking in accent but out of game as a former rogue  boohoo this one is asking me 
none	 if assassinate is good in this moment to get a special surprise  attack on gargantuansized dragon yes  jennifer he doesnt know im here  matt its true  travis is she asking quazi or is she asking vax  liam you would almost definitely hit dragon but it would be like taking donut and hitting side of  empire state building absolutely you will hit absolutely you will take off half of one scale of  dragon i mean you can do it this is dungeons  dragons do whatever you like but im just  saying the 
none	 game will end in two minutes  matt technically its kobolds  catacombs  jennifer point made  liam i am curious to see  travis its still sleeping what else do we see in this  matt make a perception check  travis okay with advantage still blue fungus still  matt you do yeah  taliesin youre a fun guy  travis thank you taliesin 19  matt 19 glancing about you can see that the crystals across the room appear to have been  either naturally grown or some have been placed with some sort of faint 
none	 magical light behind them  that when it refracts it actually acts as a light source within the chamber almost  intentionally so to make the place prettier looking throughout this large cluster of coins on  the floor you can see broken bits of furniture and decor things that have been jammed into there  and bent slightly like vases and sculptures various pieces of art that are scattered in this  horde what does catch your eye is there is a beautiful jaggedlooking dagger with a series of  red gems across the blade a chain affixed to 
none	 its pommel that is currently resting partially jammed  underneath one of the hands of the sleeping dragon  liam tempting tempting  travis i bet hes a heavy sleeper  liam yes if anyones going to fuck with that shit its going to be you but its still a big  if  jennifer im in  travis yes  liam i also have a question about this item that im attuned to lets say that this ones not  crazy enough to grab dagger and we just want to go by this says that if you ever attempt 
none	 to flee  from danger you make wisdom save does sneaking by  matt avoiding is different than fleeing  liam i just wanted to triple check part of me thinks it would be hilarious to see me rush in  but  matt oh believe me part of me thinks itd be hilarious too but distinctive fleeing is  different if the dragon were to be awakened and engage you it might be a different deal but  slaying a sleeping creature is no glory  liam and matt yolo  travis are there any other exits out of 
none	 this room  matt currently from what you view no the rest of the chamber appears to be the home to where  this dragon is you do not see an exit and it seems strange that a dragon of this size would  find its way in or out  travis not to be a stickler for our contract but do we see any candles  matt looking around with your perception bit you glance around and you can see there is a trail of  flecks of wax that lead across the left side of the chamber into 
none	 the exit where it goes so it  looks like whatever has been transporting the mass of candles went that direction  laura great theres the exit  taliesin im going to start making my way that direction no matter what  laura sneaking sneaking as stealthy as possible  matt whos sneaking first  taliesin sure  matt make a stealth check please  taliesin thats all right 19  matt as you make your way slowly around the edge of the chamber carefully stepping gingerly on  your dwarven toes with a sudden snort it shifts slightly as 
none	 it blows hot air from its nostrils a  few coins glitter and come to rest stillness your breath is held slowly you exhale as it does  not appear to have disturbed the dragon you slowly make your way the rest of the way across  the chamber and youre now standing at the archway for the tunnel that extends beyond to the next area  whos next  liam i elbow the gnome and lip sync and i say chain  laura no no  liam i know  laura dont do it okay are you going okay 
none	 im going to try to go  matt okay make a stealth check  liam you all need to go through because you know im so big and heavy  laura once youre through and then shes got to go last because shes going to try and steal that  dagger  matt whatd you roll  laura 13  matt 13 okay as you slowly make your way through theres a slight shift to the dragons  neck position as it turns snorting one eye slightly opens and you watch as the interior  secondary lid flicks a little 
none	 bit and a voice grunting and it instinctually lobs out a jet of  flame in your direction i need you to make a dexterity saving throw please  laura ten  travis thats a lot of dice  matt you take 38 points of fire damage  laura well im unconscious oh wait no okay wait let me do my math because i have my mage  armor up which means that my arcane ward is active which means i have 19 hit points on my  ward  matt which it takes those off first yes  laura 
none	 yes so that means theres how many 38 minus 19 so 19 left so im still alive  matt so the dragon after snorting haphazardly in a brief moment of being roused from its slumber  its dream it goes back to sleep as the jet of flame subsides you look over and see this what  once was a tightly and wellplacedtogether bun is now a singed mat of scraggled gnome hair as the  mage stands there covered in soot little bits of fire burning off the edge of the cloakrobe  taliesin im going to throw a 
none	 cure wounds at that to help with that  laura im going to stealthily run toward him  matt you catch up with bundle as he goes ahead and heals go ahead and roll for that  taliesin you get 11 points back to help  matt all right whos next  travis ill go  matt make a stealth check  travis thats a five  matt all right as you follow suit behind your gnomish friend clank clank a couple of  footfalls hit and you hear how loud it is you stop snorting heck yeah its totally 
none	 sleeping  two more steps clang clang clang snorting you hold still okay its fine two more steps  clang shink your foot hits a small pot on the ground which breaks and shatters at the impact of  your armored foot grunting and whooshing make a dexterity saving throw  travis nope five again  matt okay  travis let the dice hit the floor  matt 35 points of fire damage  larua oh jeez are you alive  matt as this gout of fire slams into and burns all of your flesh it takes all personal strength 
none	  to not scream out in pain as the flames subside youre like gasping  travis yeah can i  matt are you still holding the rope that connects  travis oh i was wasnt i i still had reek  matt yeah the rope is burned off now reeks while still bound doesnt have a tether  travis did he get smoked by the fire too  matt no because he was a number of feet behind you hes like gasping but you can make the  rest of the way if you would like to  travis yeah 
none	 i would like to and can i lay on hands dump the rest of my hit point pool into  okay  matt and so the three of you are across now its just the two of you and reeksus  liam okay so you want to try to tangle with the devil and try to take this blade  jennifer i do i do  liam hm and what is the landscape like from where they are to where we are here  matt it looks like most of it is either a small maybe eight to tenfootwide walkway 
none	 with bits of  furniture and gold that are pressed over there and a few small pillars that have nothing resting  on them at the moment and along the curved wall where everyone has been stealthing around the  rest of the chamber is filled by hoard pile and the dragon  liam heres what i think if i fucking move big noise jig is blown you need me to stay still so  you do your thing and if it goes well you go and then i go if things go bad we all die together  jennifer 
none	 things go bad can you run while i distract him with my things going bad  liam you know no promises well see what happens good luck  jennifer here goes nothing  matt stealth check  liam stealth oh its a one does she have she does not does she have what i had  matt are you talking about reliable talent thats a much higher level skill unfortunately  liam oh too bad so sad  matt so as you approach and grab the base of the dagger you slowly climb up the coins and get your  
none	 hand around the hilt as you tug its caught on something youre like no i dont know if this  is worth it you pull again its caught on something eventually it comes free whew you  glance up and watch as this large yellow eye is looking right down at you as a deep voice begins  to vibrate the ground the coins jangle at the sheer bass of its intensity might i ask what  youre doing  jennifer i thought it was stuck in your hand i thought i would help  matt well allow me to 
none	 help you the arms suddenly reach out and grab as it lifts its torso  back its head retracts as it inhales  taliesin power word shield  matt okay so youre using power word shield on her go ahead and roll up for that you guys are  over there what are you doing  liam lrjenkins1234  matt what are you guys doing this large dragon is now rearing back what are you doing  liam running forward  matt i need everyone to roll initiative  jennifer 16 temporary hit points what does that mean  taliesin 
none	 it means add 16 that youre about to probably lose  liam so youre there  jennifer 56 62 72  liam but this is where youre at isnt it or is that where youre at  jennifer no im right here thats where im at  liam you shouldnt be there because you cant go higher than that so now you add 16 to that and  thats where you are so 45 add 16  jennifer 61  liam yeah  matt all right so initiative everyone 25 to 20  laura 20  liam 24 oh shit

none	 points of damage as you strike arching your adventurefury blessed blade of the thrill  seeker across the chest of the red dragon it scrapes through and you see a little trickle of  blood begin to spill from the little bit of scales that you carved through its still inhaling and  seems to not even notice your presence  liam oh buddy lets go  matt all right that ends your turn greldamine  laura im going to hide and not fight a dragon  matt okay so youre retreating into the hallway and hiding  laura yeah 
none	  matt you run deeper into the hallway are you trying to make a hide action  laura sure  matt make a stealth check so you disappear into the screaming into the cavern  laura oh i didnt stealth very well seven  matt okay you feel like youre pretty stealthed all right lohkor  travis i run forward with my warhammer and im going to take two attacks and im going to dump  divine smite into both of them  matt go for it  travis smite 22 for the first one  matt that hits

none	 second strike you go to swing at  it and it hits the scales and the impact causes your entire body to shake from the sheer force of  its armor against your impact no effect that ends your turn  travis yes it does  matt all right the dragon rears back and releases an entire burst of fire breath towards  all of you except for you youre just out of range because you ran everyone else make a  dexterity saving throw please  travis you have plus two because youre near me  liam what did

none	 like the light  source seems to be moving of its own accord almost alive a smaller elderly kobold stands  next to this wax throne with a tiny violin and hes playing music as the kobold king sitting on  the throne has his eyes partially closed listening you see through the shadows of the  flickering candlelight amongst the various piles beyond your vision apparently other kobolds are  also in the chamber rummaging around moving organizing placing goods theyve received thats  what you see  laura how far away is the throne  matt its about

none	 the violinist is ashes as the flames subside you watch as theres a kobold shaped skeleton  clutching a now burning violin that tumbles into a pile on the ground at which point the other  kobolds jump out damaged and burning looking to king togwaggle as hes sitting there the edges of  his chin beard burning and curled up he has this giant shovel that he has resting at his side and  he glances up at his crown and goes rakanishu it looks like company we has and you no take  candle slams the shovel onto

none	 the impact as the jaw slowly falls slack both  eyes are cross eyed the forehead is pushed inward and he gurgles before falling onto his  back onto the ground unconscious and bleeding horribly all right that end your turn  travis yeah  matt all right at the end of your turn you glance over and you notice the mage is down and  you watch the shattered lantern suddenly flames are beginning to emerge and swirl you see all the  nearby candle wicks that have been slowly burning away from the heat of the room the 
none	 flames are  almost being drawn from the candles towards this lantern and this flame that is growing in the  center and you see all the kobolds are now going rakanishu rakanishu rakanishu that ends your  turn aerwin youre up  jennifer we need to get to safety for a minute and get everybody healed i think  matt you have two outs here there latrine room and there is the crack where you were in  jennifer latrine room  matt you go darting for the latrine room  jennifer yep  matt okay so you double 
none	 dash around leaping over the body of king togwaggle leaping off of  the soft wax mound out of the range of the kobolds that can get a swipe at you dart into the  open latrine room and as you dart inside you see a makeshift royal restroom complete with a  terrible smell youd expect from a kobold latrine there is a rickety wooden commode series three of  these nasty looking supposed to look nice but arent really nice at all kobold toilets even  dangerous to sit in they look like they have shards of wood

none	 ten  so you watch first off rakanishu takes double damage for that takes 30 points of cold  damage being vulnerable to the cold you watch as the fire entity freezing sounds the flames  slightly flicker and pull in there and the ice thats encased around it seems to create this orb  or sphere thats holding it in place the source of the fire thats drawing towards it seems to be  temporarily cut off and all but one kobold are all locked by ice one seems to break forth growling  and snorting my candles now 
none	 all right does that end your turn or do you you can still  move  laura im going to move im going to run towards the latrine  matt okay half your movement to get up from prone because you were unconscious so you can get  about ten to 12 feet you rush over youre about maybe ten feet away from it but youre making  your way as best you can  laura are there any candles around  matt there are dozens of candles  laura still  matt yeah i mean they seem softer and

none	 who got back up and swing at you its going to rush up to you and  swing with its pickaxe  thats going to be a 17 plus four thats going to be a 21 you take five points of piercing  damage are you still up  laura yeah  matt the other two are going to begin throwing their pickaxes they have a whole cluster of them  in their bag and theyre throwing them as best as they can one of thems going throw at you and  then one more because one of them died 
none	 is going to throw at you so against you thats going to  be a 14  travis misses sorry  matt against you thats going to be a 12 you guys are deflecting the pickaxes in the middle of  the air ending their turn it is now rakanishus turn  laura at least he cant move you guys  matt all right so beginning of the round the ice breaks his movements still zero so  rakanishu cannot move but youre watching as he begins to gather the flames again from the nearby  candles this is a 
none	 burning fire elemental entity made of pure rage and flame and this flickering  voice goes free that foolish kobold knew not what he had i will be the new firelord and his  mouth opens and you watch as all the flames begin to pull out all of the candles in the room are  snuffed as the flames are consumed and the elemental begins to grow bigger and bigger as it  does so everyone whos still in the room which is you you and youre at the door and you all  suffer one point of fire 
none	 damage  and then as part of his attack hes going to use his explode roars and detonates in the chamber  40foot radius so thats all of you  liam is that a dex save  matt nope all of you ignite no immediate damage but youre all on fire at the top of your  round you take 1d6 fire damage until you take an action or something to put the fire out all  right so thats the end of rakanishus turn its your turn  travis pained noises i run forward  matt top of your 
none	 turn you take six points of fire damage  travis i run forward with two attacks from my warhammer against rakanishu that is 16  matt misses you swing and the flames seem to dodge out of it you hit air as it seems to be  reforming its body to avoid the blows and then going back into its semisolid fire form  travis 23  matt 23 hits  travis ten and i will use my bonus action to dump searing smite into this one so thats an extra  five points of what kind of damage im 
none	 not sure i think its fire  matt searing smite yeah thats fire damage that does nothing against a fire elemental  travis that was so smart  matt so as the flames consume your hammer and it hits it devours the fire from the hammer  travis well cool good deal all right next  matt laughter you still do weapon damage on top of it so roll that  travis it was ten points  matt all right ten damage there that ends your turn that brings us to you aerwin  jennifer im going to go after 
none	 it with the kingslayer try to take it out  matt at the top of your round because youre on fire technically you were low in the water  because you were low in the water the flames when they begin to take form on you and begin to  engulf you duck low and you would have probably been unaffected water puts out the flames all  right so you let go of the pole you rush back into the chamber you cannot get quite close  enough to hit him with a melee you could throw the dagger 
none	 if you want to or shoot it  jennifer oh with the crossbow yes im going to do the crossbow  matt okay so bolt in release it fire with the crossbow  liam is lohkor adjacent  matt he is yes so you get sneak attack  jennifer im going to add because its the dagger  liam no youre doing the crossbow you said you can do the dagger  jennifer its the dagger in the crossbow  liam you cannot fire it you can throw the dagger or you can fire the crossbow  jennifer throwing the 
none	 dagger so 30  matt 30 thatll hit roll damage  liam so 1d4 roll the pyramid then roll your four cubes add that all up  jennifer eight 11 13 16 plus poison  matt no poison damage the elemental is immune to poison unfortunately its made of fire there  are no veins for the poison to affect the dagger slams into the fiery torso and you see a moment  of resistance as the blade carves into the flames then falls and clatters to the ground below it it  seems like it did some damage but 
none	 it doesnt seem to be reacting to the impact  jennifer so now i daggered him can i shortsword him  liam no you cant do another attack you can use a bonus action  jennifer im going to back up  matt you can dash back into the water if you want to so you go back to the water holding on  there the waters rushing below you you can see the water as its rushing in its disappearing  into a small opening where the rest of the river is disappearing towards that ends your turn that 
none	  brings us to bundle  taliesin first thing im going to do is attack with the spiritual weapon as my bonus action so  thats oh that probably hit 23  matt wait no i got the order wrong quazirat hold onto that roll  liam okay so im on fire fuck it i run and i attack i shout for argus and i run forward to  him and i would like to attackattack for my attack but then also use my recovered action  surge so ill hit this fucker three times first one is good dont

none	 28 all told  matt 28 all told gotcha okay so as youre slamming into it the flames are burning your  skin and youre wincing swinging as hard as you can a few make purchase into its body and you  can see it carving away it reacts a bit from the hits but the giant jackolantern fire grin  continues to swell and grow with its physical size  liam its all right i hold my ground and block my friends  matt okay ending that now it comes to top of the round your turn  laura 
none	 are there any more kobolds alive  matt there are three of them actually yes there are three of them but theyre on fire it  didnt distinguish everything caught fire in the room and there are three kobolds going pained  noises as theyre burning up rakanishu dont give a shit  laura okay well im going to cast sleep at 2ndlevel so that gives me 7d8 worth of hit dice  to knock people out  matt okay roll that  travis whoa sleep  laura im thinking theyre d6 but theyre not counting  liam dont act
