i believe that gets us caught up and ready to  dive into tonights episode of critical role  click tv static  groovy critical role theme  /none/ matt hello and welcome back last we left off the mighty nein had gotten in bed with a rebel  group who had been meeting in the interior of zadash unhappy with some members of the local  government of this city they had been trying to discover a way they could discredit some of the  corrupt individuals that have been causing some strife in this city to some of the locals you had  met some of these individuals a few times to discover that there is an end of harvest gala that  was arriving fairly soon /none/ that was going to be a distraction period to allow them to infiltrate the  abodes of two individuals in particular lord sutan and the highrichter prucine you discussed  with them last time a plot fixing their notverywellputtogether plot into a better  direction thankfully  travis were all fucked  matt to acquire a wax seal within the home of lord sutan to create a letter that you feel would  be incriminating then to infiltrate the highrichters home do the same and then report  them to the lawmaster or whoever else youd think would be of /none/ higher estate this is transpiring  tomorrow evening where we last left off it was later in the afternoon after your final  discussion you guys have a day to prepare however you wish to  sam a whole day  laura well half a day and then a whole other day  matt mighty nein what would you like to do  travis whats the lawmasters name  matt orentha  marisha dayana prucine  matt thats the highrichter  marisha oh orentha  laura where are we right now  matt right now you guys have just finished /tavern/ meeting with the other members of the knights of  requital in  travis at the song and supper inn  matt song and supper yes  taliesin previously known as the knights of requital  everybody right yes  matt no longer  travis we’ve got to figure out where fucking lord sutan is right we dont have any eyes on that location  marisha i think it might also be smart to see if we can drum up any type of handwriting samples for  possibly both the lord sutan and the highrichter so we can more convincingly /none/ forge documents  taliesin we have book boy too he could probably tell if theyre the same or not with his  marisha with his brain  taliesin with his brain  marisha with his head  taliesin yes well the eyes in it yes  laura wait what did you say i wasnt listening  sam groans  laura there was a spiderweb in the corner of the room and its really pretty  marisha youre good at forging right  laura yes i am why do you ask  marisha we have to get some handwriting samples right /none/ of the lord and the highrichter that way  we can write letters make it seem like theyre  laura yes i’m very good at writing letters  travis where would we find something thats handwritten  sam maybe on the job board at that place  travis would that come from them you think  sam i dont know  liam they might have some sort of edict written by prucine  travis yeah we didnt really check to see if they had signed any of them did they  taliesin we had them would we have noticed if /none/ they were handsigned or if they’d been printed  matt at the job postings you had seen on the task board outside of the kings hall they were  handwritten but they all had been written by the herald of the hall he was the one who was  handling most of the jobs that were being distributed whatever information comes to him  hes the one who posts them it seems  laura well i guess we we’ll just have to find a letter within their house and then i can forge it  right away  sam on /none/ the spot how fast a forger are you  laura im a really quick thinker and im also a pretty fast writer  sam here lets test you im going to write down stammering oh what a goose i am copy my handwriting  laura okay  matt laughing  sam its pretty good  laughter  matt i was going to make you roll for it but no you got this  marisha nott i think we’re going to need you to both break in the house and also maybe into some  safe that they have in there /none/  sam me  marisha yeah youre good at lockpicking  sam okay will i be in there alone  marisha no we’ll be with you  liam we will decide who goes in i also want to discuss what exactly we are going to forge before  we go in because the plan that they laid out for us was not good  marisha you can say it  liam scheisse is a word for it but they talked about making it look like sutan had broken into  prucines home and rolled it i dont know what effect /none/ that would have on her so i think maybe we  hatch some sort of conspiracy between the two of them to assassinate orentha so we will go to  sutans house and we will leave  sam i’m drinking  marisha nott what was the last thing caleb said  sam i always listen to caleb hes my righthand man  marisha what did he say  sam poutine  marisha that’s not what he said but that is delicious and now i want some  liam follow me please for a moment we have to do our homework /none/ first but after we do homework  we go to sutans we find this seal we hold onto it we leave fake communication that you will  write that is from the highrichter calling for a hit  laura but how will we leave something from the highrichter if i dont know actually what her  handwriting looks like yet  travis i was thinking do they have post here in this city someone that comes and picks up mail  could we jack some of her fucking outgoing mail  liam you have stolen mail  marisha i have /none/  liam you can do it again  sam youre proficient in mail fraud  marisha i am definitely proficient in mail fraud  travis what time is it  matt its later afternoon  travis whats the exact time no im just kidding  matt dont pull a liam  marisha there would be a public record somewhere right  laura a public record of her handwriting  sam well if she’s issued any sort of royal official things yeah there should be some sort  of record  laura she is a judge after all right  marisha /none/ and generally those public records tend to need to be open for  taliesin these are the most intense public officials ive ever attempted to swindle so im  not entirely sure what we do at this level  marisha well i will say worst case scenario we dont necessarily need to match her handwriting  but some type of coding potentially linked back to her we can almost mimic it people who are  doing sneaky things never use their real handwriting  taliesin leave a mark on a tree etcetera if you agree to these terms and then /none/ we leave a mark on  a tree similar sort of thing  marisha sure maybe some accounts of the myriad  taliesin a bag of gold in a trash receptacle  travis what the fuck are you talking about  sam were leaving a bag of gold in a trash receptacle  taliesin im saying that theres nothing to commit proof other than money actually exchanging  hands we used money for these things all the time back in my day so if that letter asks for some  sort of assurance or some sort of money to be /none/ placed please hire a couple people you can  leave some money in this location for them and if they find that money then they know they  actually consented and agreed to this whole argument  laura this is very complicated  sam extremely  taliesin it isnt that complicated  travis what if we divide our forces for now and try to find that handwriting sample one of us  goes and looks for the post the other one tries to find those public records  laura what if i go find the highrichter and ask for her /none/ autograph  sam like youd be a fan  laura yeah  taliesin i dont know if richters have fans  travis yeah she was kind of unpleasant  laura really  travis yeah she wasnt really about that fan life  liam did not care about your buttons  laura that’s right she was vain  liam the goal to be that we leave something in sutans house that would make it seem that the  highrichter has ordered a hit on orentha and we leave something behind in sutans house fake  communications with the myriad so we /none/ tie sutan to the myriad we tie sutan to richter and then at  richters house we leave forged documents we have a letter from sutan with the seal and also  we leave communication with the knights whatsit  marisha of requital where i thought you were going molly which isnt a bad idea to leave some  sort of money trail is leave a certain amount of money with any type of paperwork that might also  be mentioned in a document in the adjacent house so paranoid rich people are always paranoid rich  people right so /none/ they always have these safes filled with documents  laura oh yes we had one of those at our house  marisha were you guys paranoid  laura well no we just had a lot of secrets  silence  marisha yeah  taliesin im baffled by the notion of building a box inside of a larger box inside of a larger box  to hold papers but fine  sam step one is find documents this is the most exciting thing we’ve ever done  marisha we also need to find where lord sutan lives  sam oh so /none/ find addresses and documents  marisha correct  sam ooh cue the music  laura i bet that the people in the knights previously knights they would know where lord  sutan lives  marisha they might even have some sort of documentation or record remember dolan was saying  that they got ousted from their practice because of this lord sutan maybe they already have a  paper trail  laura dont we know where dolan lives  marisha we do nott tracked them  sam i do i saw their home he lived  laura oh yes harold /none/ horris  liam also they will put out of businesses if possible they have some sort of paperwork that  would come from the desk of the highrichter  travis possibly but if we go by there we cant be seen  laura we cant be seen wed have to be in disguise or one of us  travis or knock on the back door if such a thing exists  taliesin lets start by talking to our friends before we start investigating our allies  laura yes lets go that way  marisha do we have any  laura /none/ go get him monk  marisha thats going to be really cool when i can do that really cool catch a fly anyway moving  on that was me  laura should we go to dolans house  sam all of us  travis is that how we want to find lord sutans address  laura maybe the richters handwriting too  marisha i wonder if we can track down ulog  travis that seems like a good idea  sam one thing at a time  liam thats another thing and we can table this but there is also /none/ the possibility that this  is all just a honey trap and that we’re being drawn in for as big a fish than the knights are themselves  marisha you think were big fish  liam well i think that they think they are looking for potentially big fish im not saying  that we are big fish but we might be walking into a trap so eyes on a swivel is all i’m saying  travis so youre saying ulog probably is in trouble and is going to roll over on us in order  to get something taken /none/ off of him  liam potentially or any of them ulog seems the shiftiest but that doesnt mean that he would  necessarily be  laura ulog’s probably listening to us right now  travis to dolans then  sam all of us all right lets go  matt all right you guys make your way following nott who had previously trailed dolan to the  home and you eventually find your way to the outskirts of a very simple it’s a hovel but  only because its been in disuse for a while there is a single front door /none/ it looks to be a  twochamber home with one large central main living space and one bedroom in the back the roof  itself is made of heavily pressedtogether thatch and stick as soon as you approach you can see  that the front door is closed and you see a little bit of movement through the window someone  walking around  sam who wants to go knockyknocky  laura we shouldnt be seen with them  travis yeah you said theres no back door right side windows anything like that  sam no i just saw a /none/ window and a door right  matt from what you saw yeah  travis well it should be one of the three of us because thats who theyll know  liam you two have been speaking to them the longest  travis mmhmm  laura go do it fjord  liam you are a good talker fjord  travis okay  sam in disguise or as is  travis yeah im going to fucking change it up is there a little alley that i can pop into before  i head over to his place of residence  matt yeah /town/ two buildings over you look off to the side and theres a small alcove of shade where  you could probably pop in quickly and dispense a spell without it causing any ruckus  travis yeah i cast disguise self and i turn back into that black cloak with gold trim the long  black hair  matt the same figure you brought to the highrichters  travis thats right  matt all right  marisha i tie my robe  matt okay  travis nice  marisha its all ive got  matt doesnt take a spell slot  /none/ laura youre not going up there with him right because hes in disguise now you look the same beau  travis yeah if you look like you  marisha no i got that yeah  travis we dont want to have them see us going over there  marisha okay well then you go  travis cool all right  marisha feel free to give me like a  travis oh whats the sign  laura screeching bird call  liam no thats not it  travis a peacock  laura i thought that was a hawk  sam pigeon /none/ cooing  travis was that supposed to be a hawk a pigeon pigeon cooing  sam pigeon cooing  travis fair enough its a pigeon a feral pigeon  marisha ill listen for the pigeon  liam a peacock is a fancy pet  sam what are we signaling for  travis if theres trouble  laura and sam okay  travis all right  marisha theres a signal we have one  travis i walk over to dolans house  matt all right knock on the door  liam what happens if a pigeon goes by  laughter  /none/ sam a flock of pigeons come down  liam spell noises  matt all right as you knock on the door theres a pause and you see out of the corner of the  window the edge of a face peek out there and then disappear behind and a voice goes who is it  travis yes it is i bring word from the mighty nein may i come in please  matt you hear some rustling some unlocking process and the door opens up and you can see  horris opens the door and dolans behind yes please come /none/ in looks just past you as you enter  the building and they close the door behind you  travis is there anyone in the room that i dont see besides horris and dolan  matt its just the two of them at the moment  marisha do i see sorry  travis ill drop the disguise  matt okay they both pause for a second oh wow all right you are as skilled as they say it  seems thats pretty useful  travis i apologize we realize that after you drawl i apologize  laughter  travis after /dung/ we finished speaking we realized we werent aware of where lord sutan resided  matt oh right his abode he lives in the gilded willows in the trispires  marisha knew that much  matt hes i would say not too terribly far from the skyscape park and where the constellation  bridge tower stands its a threestory house dark wood gold leaf carving its a bit gaudy  hard to miss amongst some of the other ones there although all of them are gaudy in their own right  look for the threestory irongated dark greenwood building in that /none/ vicinity  travis great will do another thing that we realized in our efforts to frame and forge  which are vast you dont happen to have any handwriting from lord sutan do you  matt unfortunately no most lords are very careful with documentation transfer back and  forth they usually go through direct parcel services  travis there was nothing that ousted you from your business any sort of receipt or  matt oh no chuckles nothing that was directly from his hand at least they usually go  through intermediaries for that purpose  travis is there /none/ anyone else in the area that we should know that he does business with that he  might communicate with regularly  matt i mean that would be the one that replaced us and he nudges over to horris on the side  that would be i had that written down somewhere in here oh shit its my older notes  travis theres a pen pal and finding out who the pen pal is  matt exactly  sam pigeon cooing  marisha this is really good all to know now were getting all this information  laura and sam /none/ as pigeons highrichter  travis no theres no fucking pigeons  laura as pigeon highrichters handwriting  matt i believe its ren sutan  travis ren sutan  matt yes if not the internet will correct me  sam ren sutan is his name  travis thats who he wrote to though  laura oh i thought sutan was a title like lord lord lord  matt oh no lord diedric sutan is his name ren  travis its who he wrote to  matt ren is his son who he placed to destroy and take over our practice  /none/ travis well he sounds like a real son of a bitch  matt you hear horris off to the side arms crossed now hearing all this goes yeah you  could say that  travis this ren sutan any idea where we might be able to find him  matt they both look at each other and you watch as dolan glances out the window not that far  outside of the apple tree tutorship vicinity you will find a white and peach building with a few  banners in the front and thats rens new practice  travis a /dung/ physician also  matt yes  travis a dark physician most likely hmm  matt i mean sure he looks confused  laughter  matt dark physicianry i guess is an issue in some parts of the world i suppose  travis yeah rampant where im from just real fucking dark  matt he looks back at horris horris is like right well if you come across any dark  physicianry please do your best to quell it where it seeds  laughter  travis indeed i will indeed  matt thank you  travis you probably will not be /none/ hearing from us again before the task is done  sam and laura as pigeons highrichter  travis no  laura as pigeon we need it more highrichter  laughter  taliesin i keep trying to make a sound its just nothings working  travis was i supposed to say stuff about the highrichter  marisha i dont know id say take the footinmouth signal  laura we need the handwriting of the highrichter more than lord sutans handwriting  matt youre not there  laura exasperated sound  laughter  sam we blew it  laura fuck as pigeon /tavern/ highrichter  sam as pigeon highrichter  travis thank you we wont trouble you any longer  matt no worries i suppose since tomorrow evening when everythings set to go me and  horris kara were not going to be present when all of this goes down so we have deniability when  we turn our information in for this whole endeavor but i think ulog and you guys should  meet on the outside of the tavern that we met at earlier today to kick this off  travis song and supper inn  matt you got it  /none/ travis mmhmm  matt well good luck and  marisha drawl mustard biscuits  liam drawl youre just a little feller you oughtn’t talk like that  travis lock that door behind me and i leave  matt all right locks the door  sam how did it go  laura did you get the handwriting  travis stupid pigeons  sam and laura did you get the handwriting of the highrichter  travis yeah but im not sharing it yep got it got it no problem read it looked at it i  understand what it looks like lets /none/ go  laughter  laura fjord we need it really bad  travis nope sorry not going to help you  laura did you not get it  marisha what did they say though  travis a whole bunch of stuff but i cant say it around them i just won’t out of principle  marisha okay all right yep  liam yeah but actually do you think you could go back and say that you forgot to ask a question  laura just say hey the whole point of this was to find the highrichters handwriting as well  /none/ and maybe  liam i understand that these two are really busting your balls and i commiserate with that  but we do need in fact to ask  travis now see if you ask nicely yeah things will ha i walk back up to the door  laughter  travis knockknockknock  matt the eye peeks through the window once again  travis one more thing  matt door opening  marisha im keeping an eye out for anyone watching  travis totally forgot to ask you dont happen to have any handwriting from the highrichter do you  /none/ matt no that would make this a lot easier  travis yeah i know  laughter  travis great  matt sorry  travis have a good day  matt you too door closing  travis no none  liam okay well we checked that box off so now we have to get to work  sam we got some good information we got sutans address and rens address  travis yeah blah blah blah rens address and the address now you got it  sam oh my god  marisha oh and its super interesting  laura whoa that /none/ is really good fjord you did a really good job in there  marisha also super interesting that they mentioned having other people do their work for  them pause okay lets go  travis was that mentioned  marisha he said they have other people do parcel service and stuff for him  travis oh okay yeah that blah  marisha see  sam so youre saying that we could use other handwriting as well and it wouldnt be out of the  ordinary as long as it beared the signature and seal of said place  marisha well /none/ maybe not even a signature most people trying to be smart about not getting caught  arent probably like my name and social security number  laura what if we get some parchment that says from the home office of lord sutan  sam ooh a letterhead  marisha you want stationery sure  taliesin beyond actual personal stationery i think the notion would be is that you would  actually send your actual handwriting in something like this because that way they would know that it  was you you would be very careful how and who you would /none/ send that through you wouldnt want a  second person taking dictation as you plotted to overthrow the government  marisha okay well how about this i think the seal is going to be good i think any type of  money amount mentioned in any of the letters and then we cross that and leave that type of amount  of gold in the like theres been a money hand off  travis were getting ahead of ourselves lets stay on task lets head to the gilded willows  where in the trispire where the fucking scottsdale party what /none/ do these notes say  skyskate park and constellation boulevard  liam knotts berry farm  sam constellation bridge  travis yeah that thing  sam constellation bridge  matt constellation bridge tower and skyscape park  marisha in between adventureland and frontierland  laughter  travis yeah i was writing real fast  taliesin its good theres a bathroom on the way to that that works out well  marisha yeah yeah yeah  sam so were going there with the express purpose of  travis just recon were trying to see what this place looks like if we /none/ can see lord sutan then  well make a decision if we go after his son or not who maybe has some of his handwriting  sam thats in the trispire so we need to go through the sewers to get there  taliesin maybe a birthday card  laura or we can go up a few of us through the actual front gates and then meet up with everyone  marisha okay well how about half of us go to lord sutans and half of us go check out rens  travis sure  laura okay  sam what /none/ are we looking for at rens  travis handwriting  sam okay from his papa  travis and see if rens a son of a bitch yeah  sam okay  marisha ill go to check out ren  travis yeah me too because i cant make it through the gates  laura oh  sam i dont think anyone can make it through the gates except for you  travis thats what i was wondering what you were talking about  taliesin i thought we were going to take the sewer to get in there  laura i thought /none/ beau might be able to get through the gates actually  marisha i could get through the gate  laura huh  travis because shes got a cloak now  laura yeah and its not a magical disguise  marisha okay  travis cool  marisha ill go check out yeah  laura okay  travis caleb where you want to go buddy  liam i will go to sutans  travis wait theyre both sutan  liam no the elder im sorry  sam will you be able to get in  liam not without you youll come with /none/ me  sam well sneak on in through the sewers  liam well how do you want to do it  sam theyre talking about going straight in through the gate because theyre you know respectable  laura distraught well its such a thing to get into the sewers we have to make a distraction and  everything every time  taliesin perhaps we should just have a two person reconnaissance for now  laura right  marisha we can manage ourselves  liam okay  marisha were good  laura yes we wont get into any trouble  travis /tavern/ yeah you wont bring back clarota or nothing itll be great  laura we know our way around  taliesin too soon  travis cant be  marisha we got this lets go  travis should we meet back at the song  supper inn at what sunset  marisha what time is it  laura or just at the leaky tap  matt you got maybe an hour and half to two hours before sunset  laura lets just meet back at the leaky tap  travis okay fair enough  sam at the leaky  laura yeah  /none/ marisha the leaky or the song  supper were talking about two different leaky tap  travis leaky tap  marisha hour and a half all right  laura lets go  marisha break  laura woo  matt you both make your way toward the trispire as you make your way towards the front entry gates  there one of the guards posted there is familiar with you and begins to let you through as you approach  marisha i flip it to the blue side cobalt  matt as you pass through a few steps behind jester the /none/ guard approaches “halt i dont  believe ive seen you through here before  marisha oh im  laura she came through earlier shes with me  marisha literally like 24 hours ago  matt very well  marisha thank you  matt steps back you guys make your way following the directions to the gilded willows  you see the massive treetops that fill out the skyline from your perspective every home seems to  have a row of greenery between its a very very beautiful neighborhood you can follow where the  constellation bridge tower as a beacon /dung/ and as it guides you towards its area it doesnt take long  for you to see the large gaudy threestory complex that is lord sutans home you can see the  gold leaf carving along the edges of each of the various stories in between the dark green slats  that are there are coated in some sort of a lacquer material that almost glistens in the  sunlight as it passes the sunset colors now starting to make their way into the cloudcovered  sky you do see marble pillars at the corner of the estates grounds with /none/ iron gates that link  each of them with about maybe five foot bit of simple lawnhill that separates the gap between  the gate and the building itself  marisha are the gates chained shut or does it look like theres a lever  matt well the gates on all them are solid except for in the very front and the very back both of  them appear to be closed and locked you do see posted at the front of the front door there are  two crownsguard that are there keeping watch on the back end as /none/ you case around to the rear side  of the home there is a singular crownsguard and a dog that is on a chain  marisha two in front does it look like theres any blind spots any trees that go up and cusp over  the walls  matt make a perception check  travis hashtag nbc blindspot  marisha not good eleven  matt its hard to see where any perspective would be a blind spot for entry other than above or  from the sides because the front and back seem pretty well covered by these guards /town/ as theyre  currently posted and standing there so the only things that really make sense would be either  flanking the building or something that guides you over top thats all you can think of  laura how high are the buildings next to the house  matt the one that is immediately to the left of it is twostory its a shorter building there is  a tree to the immediate right of it that rises up to about the height if not a little taller than  the actual home itself the building next to it is /town/ another two stories this one lords over the other  buildings but there is one large tree that is about five feet from the edge of the wall  laura okay that seems usable  marisha its a big jump but we can do it its not too big  laura like a five feet jump  marisha thats doable yeah  laura from like a swinging branch  marisha from rooftop to wall  matt its five feet to the wall and then about five feet from the wall to the actual building so  its a ten foot /none/ from the tree to the roof  taliesin could you parkour the wall  matt you could certainly try  marisha that was what i was thinking wall to wall  sam monk shit  taliesin i knew you were already there  marisha do they look like one of the  matt the gates about eight feet tall and the building is three stories so i mean there are  some roofedge perches the stories kinda taper with each additional floor so there is a small  space maybe a foot a foot and a half wide that you /none/ could shoot for if there was something you  wanted to try but  laura are there windows on that side of the house  matt there are no windows on the base floor or at least none that you can see the second floor  you do see one set of double windows that open though they are currently closed those are on the  two side edges of the building  laura is there a balcony connected to them  matt no theres no balcony  marisha no balcony so there appear to be  matt the only /none/ balcony you saw was in the large balcony at the front of the highrichters home  but not on this one  marisha no balcony okay  laura so a few guards  marisha uhhuh  laura a dog  marisha a dog i like dogs  laura i love dogs  matt as you glance at the back of the building the doors that you see immediately there is one  set of doors that is the front with the two guards are the back where the other gate entrance is  there isnt another door that leads into /tavern/ the home there is a doublecellar door that descends  beneath that is what is currently being guarded with a man and the dog  laura okay i wonder if anything would lure the guards away from the house  marisha yeah maybe a drunk a drunkard trying to break in somewhere else  laura maybe  marisha you know a public disturbance  laura maybe a drunk trying to talk to them in the front of the house or something  marisha yeah  laura or in the back  marisha i mean our group is pretty good at /none/ causing distractions  laura yeah  marisha they can do that thats totally  laura some people jump up and over  marisha yeah its going to have to go fast  laura yeah oh man maybe we could get some rope and a grapple  marisha yeah we could do that  laura we could throw a grapple for ten feet i know that  marisha do i have a climbers kit  matt do you have a climbers kit  marisha i dont have a climbers kit but we can go buy a climbers kit  laura we /none/ can go get a climbers kit  marisha yeah okay  travis i just got a shitload of ball bearings  taliesin i got ball bearings man  laughter  marisha guys lets challenge ourselves we have to break in only using ball bearings  travis yep  marisha how do we do it  matt the new dd nightmare mode  liam shiftily you need some some ball bearings man  matt youre all level one bards with nothing but ball bearings go  taliesin call me pinball wizard  laura we did a good job scouting this place /none/ out and stuff  marisha yeah do there seem to be any weak points any loose bricks in the walls  matt unfortunately  marisha as we walk by im playing with the wall but im testing for weak spots  matt well the wall is an iron gate theyre all long iron fencing gate there are the marble  pillars at the corner of each one so its open its a series of bars  laura are they pointytop iron bars  matt they are they are poodle impalers  marisha oh  taliesin yeah that changes things the /tavern/ landscape  marisha i understand now  travis you can see if it hurts your hand if you touch it  laura i bet it does  marisha oh theres no  laura can you stick your fingers through the bar  matt do you want to try it  laura yeah  matt okay  liam you die  matt okay as you place your hand through the bar  travis no fucking way  matt nothing happens  travis laughs ah you son of a bitch  matt no its fine  marisha okay  travis vaporized noise /none/  laura disintegrate  matt game over  travis yeah new character  laura oh no  marisha you know when i used to hop fences back where i came from  laura mmhmm  sam where was that  matt youre not there  sam oh im not there  laughter  marisha if youre ever trying to get over barbedwire or any pointy fences you take a rug  or a bedroll and you throw it over there and you hop over and you  laura thats personal marisha experience isnt it  marisha yeah i mean  /none/ travis thats some fight club shit  marisha im just throwing that out there it works  taliesin a plank of wood will work too  laura i feel like that would be a really good idea i feel like it might be a little noticeable  to carry around a rug  marisha a bedroll is not too bad  laura most people in the trispire dont carry around bedrolls  liam coo haversack coo  laura yes but its little  matt shh  laura youre not there  sam its not him its a pigeon  matt /none/ thats true youre right sam  sam theres a metagaming pigeon in this  laughter  travis coo remember coo  matt coo bonus action coo  laughter  travis coo hunters mark  laughter  matt can we please make the metagaming pigeon a thing now ive played with a few in my time  laughter  travis turn undead coo  matt all right anything else you guys want to do while youre there  laura i think are we good  marisha yeah yeah yeah lets go  matt okay do you guys want and try for /none/ a climbers kit on your way back  marisha sure  matt okay it takes a little bit of time to find a place because some of the shops are starting to  close past sunset the time it took you guys to get there do a full casing and come back the sun  has set and the sky is getting darker however thankfully a climbers kit is not all that  expensive with a full cost on that come on climbers kit ha i was wrong 25 gold  marisha groans  laura what if we dont want /none/ the whole kit just the grapple part of it and the rope  matt just the grappling hook  taliesin we have rope  matt two gold  laura and the rope  marisha were just trying out the gym were not fully committed to it yet  matt laughs right can i get a consultation first  laura what is fully included in the climbers kit  matt funny voice ah climbers kit includes a lot of things normal voice includes special pitons boot tips gloves and a  harness thats for mountain climbing  liam crossfit tshirt  /none/ matt yeah  taliesin i have pitons and a hammer and rope  matt some nice core balls you can sit on yeah so you want a grappling hook and rope you can get  those those are cheaper  laura yes that would probably be a good idea  matt grappling hook is two gold and the rope you want silk or hempen  laura whispering the cheaper one  matt that would be hempen so thats one gold  sam youre probably more familiar with silk bindings  matt so three gold for a single grappling rope and /none/ rope  laura that i use for different things  sam got it  laura i dont use them at all  matt so mark down that you have a grappling hook and 50 feet of hempen rope  laura okay  matt all right as you guys are accomplishing that the rest of you  laura ill get rid of ill pay for it  marisha all right  matt the rest of you what are you doing  liam i dont think we want the group to be too big let these two handle this ren and you /none/ and i  will wait at the leaky tap and lay low  sam you want to let them go off on their own  liam we dont want to create why do we want a group  travis youve never heard of safety in numbers and all that shit  sam they have to break in somewhere theyre going to be  travis yeah man i just figured youd be a part of this  sam i mean im with you caleb if you dont want to go then lets go back to the leaky tap  liam no /none/ were going to break into houses together of course im willing to do this i just  feel like for this what are you planning to do  travis just some simple reconnaissance see if we can see ren maybe have a conversation with him  if hes not a total prick i dont know maybe hes got some of his dads handwriting  liam yeah okay  sam we dont have to go i dont care  liam no its fine  sam it sounds scary to me  liam no i my head is not in the game /none/ well go along  travis great were going to head towards the apple tree tuneship what did i write here  matt laughs the tutoring village  travis thank you  matt make an investigation check  travis oh god nine twelve  matt twelve okay it takes you a little while to get there you havent actually been to the tutor  village before  travis 13  matt okay same difference so you manage through asking questions and finding your way  around you manage to get to the tutor village right around sunset you do see about /none/ one block  over the large whitepeach building that you had previously been told by dolan you see the sign  up its called the guided hand infirmary its one story but it stretches wide towards the back  its like a large shotgun building  travis guided hand infirmary  matt the guided hand infirmary you can see light from the interior there are two windows at the  front and a row of windows as it continues down the back of the alley the alley you can see  actually lights up because the bright interior warm light /town/ reflecting off of the buildings on the  opposite side down the alley on each parallel end of it the building itself seems fairly well made  theres elements of a plaster material put against the wood to make it seem a little less cracked and  broken on the vicinity around it it looks like a little more money went into this complex than a  lot of the surrounding buildings  travis right hes a physician well before we put a personal touch on it do you people with  sneaky abilities want to see what you can /none/ see in the windows  liam yeah well we could send frumpkin to have a look around  sam thats a good idea  liam i send frumpkin he will run around the entire building if hes able hes also able to  climb things so i will get him up on top of window sills if he can to take a look inside  matt as frumpkin curls up and jumps onto the windowsill and you glance through the vision of  your familiar the first window you come across inside its a simple room it’s painted a similar /none/  white peach color theres a single bed maybe twin size with a single sheet you see an  individual who is currently lying on it with not quite caleb dirty clothes but not an  upperclassman by any means upperclassman not what i was going for thats fine  travis seniors 99  laughter  matt wooo sydney football rules weird but you do see this individual is currently has a full arm  bandaged with blood soaked and dried on parts of it and they are currently asleep and the door is  closed there is a lantern /none/ inside that is set to keep the room warm  liam is there the ability for frumpkin to move around to the exact opposite side of this building  matt yeah have him move around go around the front  liam yeah he will jump up to any windowsill on the back of the house as well  matt as frumpkin keeps watch on each of these each chamber seems to either be empty or theres  somebody in some state of either rest or waiting you see one person a younger girl maybe fifteen  or sixteen years old /tavern/ who is waiting on the edge of a bed sitting quietly in a room by herself  glancing around she looks over and sees frumpkin and goes kitty and makes the hand motion to  try and pet you go around the back door and you can see one room has two beds that currently have  two individuals that are coughing heavily theyre sick with something pretty bad and there is a  person inside that is dressed in a white robe that is in the process of bringing them both broth but  they have a mask over /town/ their face a piece of cloth tied behind and it looks like theyre treating  some diseased patients this is for all intents and purposes an infirmary  liam yeah did you say this was a one story building  matt its a one story building but its quite long it goes back quite a bit other buildings  are spotty and build the space around the outside of this block whereas this infirmary stretches  the entire length of the block  liam five to ten minutes of hopping from ground to window a bunch of times all i /none/ find are patient  rooms no sort of office or anything else  matt correct it looks like all it looks like its built so that all the rooms that have  sunlight are the rooms where the patients would stay anything important would be kept in the  interior of the building  liam one last thing how high is the roof  matt the roof is about id say 12 feet up  liam fjord come here scooch down for a second and i jump up onto ive taken my vision back i  jump up onto his /none/ back now stand up  travis 11 strength okay… oof  liam okay i snap at frumpkin and he vanishes and i reach out and frumpkin appears i am now  within ten feet i would assume of the top of the building so frumpkin is on the roof  teleportation noise i want to send him to look then i hop down off of ford and put my hand and  steady myself on fjord and have frumpkin look for any holes in the roof or if theres a skylight  or anything probably not but its worth a /none/ try  matt as youre focusing fjord you notice a small child maybe five or six years old this scruffy  reddish hair and a dirty smashed face walks up and goes what happened to the kitty  travis oh you know it ran up on the roof we were trying to chase her down you want to see if  maybe she ran around the corner  matt i was going up to pet it and it went away  travis yeah theyre tricksy like that  marisha second time your cat just vanished  travis tell you what /none/ if i see it ill call out whats your name  matt oh im simon  travis simon okay  marisha simon  sam we found him  laura simon became a real boy  matt hes a real boy  laughter  travis simon ill call out if i see him why dont you see if you run the other way see if  you can find him  matt okay he runs around the other side of the building frumpkin is on top and looking at the  top the front of it looks really nice the top /none/ which nobody sees doesnt look that great its a  pretty shoddy wooden slats over wooden slats across the entirety of the roof complex you can  see one small trap door about the center of it that is currently closed  liam okay i call him back  matt meowing  liam then i snaps fingers and then hes on my shoulder  matt at which point you hear a kid go whoa simon is now on the side staring at this  disappearing and reappearing cat  liam yeah cats are the best i dont know theres a /none/ trap door up there but i mean were  not going in  sam go go away go go away shoo go away  matt make a persuasion check  travis laughing oh my god  sam 14  matt 14 screaming and he runs  sam oh sorry  liam well done there yeah what do we want to do this place is full of sick people  travis right unless ren is actually on the inside if they had an office maybe we could  rifle through some  liam yeah and if were going in what do /none/ we do we could have one of us be ill perhaps  travis yeah or just ill on the front doorstep and keep them occupied  liam yeah  travis yeah i could you know kick the shit out of nott in the face and then be like yelling  sam i mean weve got mollymauk with us why dont you just do the same thing to him  travis i could kick the shit out of nott in the face and then like  sam i dont appreciate this at all i feel like im being singled out because /none/ im a woman  laughter  liam a better idea perhaps is for one of youre able to disguise yourself right  taliesin to a point  liam theres three of us that we can all disguise ourselves i can make myself look like  like a sick person  travis although hes a physician so he might try to you know check and i think up to touch  it falls apart  liam well you can make yourself look like you but with not green skin  taliesin its standard carny practice to be able to fake boils /none/ and stuff with a disguise kit to  leper up a bit  matt it would take you about an hour or so to do so to a studied physician probably not going to  hold up  taliesin sure  matt you can certainly try depending upon how high you roll  taliesin could fake some sick on people  travis yeah i mean i could mimic whatever you have and try to stay at arms length  taliesin you can just drag me in  travis i like it yep  taliesin i can make a scene  /none/ travis yep i like that then you two try to get into the office somehow  sam if there is an office  travis im assuming there is its a doctors office right  liam there is some sort of trapdoor in the center of that building that i dont think is mirrored by  any of the rooms that i was able to see on the outside of the building so its like a donut with  a hole in the middle is where maybe what youre looking for  travis i think that makes sense well cause a /none/ ruckus see what you can find  liam yeah ruckus you and i go in  sam okay  taliesin have we talked about the other house yet because the distraction was obvious  travis is it  taliesin and marisha what kind of dog was it  travis well theyre not here  taliesin was it a guard dog  taliesin they havent gotten back yet nevermind all right im jumping ahead  travis it was a chihuahua on a chain  taliesin we’re in  travis fierce as shit spiked collar tongue out  taliesin were going to /none/ need a bigger boat  marisha its name was princess  caleb were going to walk right in these two are going to create such a fuss  travis how long do you need to make your face all lepered up  taliesin about an hour  matt about an hour  taliesin and who said i was going to do my face  liam couldnt you maybe act like  taliesin we dont want them to look at it too closely  sam look like youre just cough and stuff  liam could you be a sick tiefling  /town/ taliesin oh im going to do that too ive got a plan  matt you’re going to spend time and apply  sam oh ive got it ive got it faster what if caleb burns all of your clothing and you go in as  a burn victim  taliesin youre not going to touch my clothing  caleb thats not we’re not doing that  taliesin no were not setting fire to my clothing im going to mess up my junk what fierce  travis oh my god  laura gross  matt in the street  taliesin no /none/ back at the do we have a place where i can work or am i going back to the leaky  tap or is that too far away  matt thats up to you you can try and duck into a shady corner and spend an hour  laura spend an hour painting your dick  taliesin an hour painting my dick no im going to need some privacy for that  laughter  taliesin im also going to need to order some breakfast food something eggy  laura ugh  travis for fucks sake jesus really  taliesin really /tavern/  travis okay all right  taliesin i thought you wanted a distraction  travis i do im all about this lets go find breakfast jesus  liam when we go in we dont walk in just you

myself  travis all right lets go we go up to the front door where are y’all going  liam were going to hang back is there a nook or an alley within view of this  matt theres alleys on each side /none/ but they both have windows that are lit so you would be in one  of those vicinities  liam can we go half a block away  matt you could you would be at a distance though  liam yeah thats fine for the moment for the moment yeah get ready were going to do  mothers love  sam how will we know when to go  liam were going to watch them at the door  matt all right so the two of you enter you go through the front door its a double door it  /none/ pushes open it doesnt appear to have resistance its on a hinge you push in and at the front  theres a clerk there wearing the same white robe a middleaged man receding hairline short  hair big bulbous red nose some pockmarking on his cheek he looks up can i help you  taliesin no im fine im perfectly perfectly fine i dont need to do any of this  travis coughing no you need help its real gross  taliesin im fine  matt he reaches down and pulls a cloth up and puts it immediately over his /none/ face okay um   taliesin no i dont  i was born in a place like this i dont want anything to  im going  to give myself a little grunt sir theres  vomit im going to go for it right in his face  liam the ruckus is audible all the way down the block so i turn myself into a halforc woman and  pick up nott like my baby and put her head on my shoulder and start walking towards the building  matt okay as youre doing that i need you to roll /none/ a deception check with advantage because  youre helping  taliesin magnets how the fuck do they work thats nice 21  matt 21 as soon as you spray in the face hes like sputtering takes the scarf off and  panting sit

blood im giving myself a good cut maybe  therell be a little /none/ ice fleck i dont know if i want to activate that if itll work on my  fingernails but what the fuck im going to start crawling leaving a trail of vomit into the next  room going no no  matt take a point of damage  taliesin yup  travis i go the opposite direction he starts walking hacking cough  matt the clerk at this point goes please stay tight im going to shit he leaves the room  sam go go go go  liam we peer in the door what is going on in this /none/ room at this point  matt you walk in as you see theres a spray of stuff across the clerks counter you see both  mollymauk and fjord crawling in opposite directions across the floor as you hear footsteps  and the clerk had just rushed out of the chamber down the hallway  liam we are going to go between them like noah through the water oh thats the wrong  moses yeah  sam like noah through the ark  liam theres vomit and eggs everywhere  matt what you see now is theres two hallways theres one /none/ to each side as you enter where the  clerks desk was it looks like theres all the rooms you saw on the right side all the rooms you  saw on the left side and there are chambers in the center of the building with the two hallways  that bisect the two areas you can choose right or left its up to you the clerk went down the  right side  liam i will take the left one if the clerk went down the right side  matt okay as youre rushing with nott in your arms /none/ you head into the hallway on the left side  and you glance and can immediately see another person with a robe who is holding a small satchel  of some sort of greenish material they walk and see you excuse me can i help you  liam crying  sam baby wails  matt make a deception check please  sam oh no me thats a negative one shriek  matt what seems to be the problem he looks as opposed to being empathically interested in your  wellbeing is genuinely disturbed by the sound the child is making /none/ rosemarys baby style  liam frumpkin appears on the back of the guys neck and starts tearing in  sam oh god youre using it to attack you can do that  matt roll an attack for frumpkin please  travis my allergies are going to be shit in about five seconds my worst nightmare  liam oh my gosh for a cat i mean its a 13 plus i dont know what  matt that hits hes wearing a robe go ahead

and throw him off frumpkin  fullon spins scatters all claws and legs out lands on the ground angry cat sound full  puffup tail and everything at this point you watch another doorway flip open and you see a man  come out with very short brown hair on the sides with a pompadour in the front and a similar white  robe but it looks like its longersleeved with more detail he goes what is /none/ all this ruckus happening  marisha ooh i hate him i hate him already  matt what is a cat doing here get the cat he watches as the clerk says i dont  shoo shoo  shoo hes trying to get frumpkin to leave now  taliesin off in the distance you hear you have no legal authority over me vomit  travis hacking cough  matt theres now other workers of the infirmary coming out of the rooms that are all starting to  gather the one who saw you in the hallway is now coming towards you /none/ while shooing frumpkin out you  watch the guy who had left the chamber head back into the office and close it people are starting  to scatter you guys are waiting in the two rooms now you said you found two separate rooms  taliesin im just running the hall  matt youre just running the hall  taliesin im crawling in the hall  matt what are you doing  travis im standing there like hacking cough i think i shit my pants  matt so youre coughing loud in the room youre crawling in the hall behind /none/ them  liam is there enough chaos for us to step into one of these open rooms and shut the door behind us  matt well find out in a second now we have you spitting and freaking out the two clerks that are  trying to push frumpkin out are trying to escort you they see you theyre like “sir sir” they  start grabbing your arms and lifting you up  taliesin vomit im still bleeding from the neck  matt they start dragging you into one of the rooms on the side they open one room and /none/ theres  somebody in there already who was sleeping but is starting to come to going whats happening  sorry they close the door go to the next chamber and start dragging you into an empty room  taliesin im going to immediately  im going to go limp  matt okay  taliesin then the minute the doors open im going to make a break for it  matt

actually this would be your choice  taliesin oh yay thats nice nine  all nine  matt you try and pull away but in the moment theyre genuinely worried about your wellbeing  theyve probably had patients try and make big physical actions while theyre in their care and  they hold you back  taliesin its magic im possessed i turn to one and go in a guttural voice the power of christ  compels you im going to use devils tongue and im going to do a couple points /none/ of damage to him  matt devils tongue or vicious mockery  taliesin vicious mockery  travis oh lord oh no  taliesin its only a couple

do  matt knocking hello is there somebody in here  sam shh  matt the door opens and you see that theres a clerk who had apparently heard the door close  behind you as you had entered the room and is now walking into /dung/ this darkened chamber as soon as the  door opens you guys are on the opposite side of the door he walks over towards the lantern in the  corner to light it because the room is dark that youre in theres nobody in there at the moment  he walks over  liam lets go out we go  sam okay lets go were going to run out the door  matt oh wait wait you guys bolt past into the hallway

want it  running down my thighs and stuff  matt theres an outhouse about two blocks down outside come back    travis you dont have anything in the building  matt get in the room well get you a pan  travis all right yeah /none/ i go in the room  matt you go in the room and one of them pulls out a metallic bedpan and sets it down on the side  travis can i have a little privacy while i check my undercarriage  matt they close the door immediately and then turn to you two “we’ll get to him in a second  what’s your problem”  liam soft voice fever she has a fever  matt “let me see her” he comes forward and puts his hands out towards nott  sam hisses  matt do you do that make /none/ an intimidation check with advantage  sam intimidation negative three how is that possible 13  matt 13 the physician goes screams falls back the other two clerks or physician helpers  catch him “get it out get it out out shoo”  sam i’m going to scamper towards the office if i can as fast as i can  matt make an acrobatics check to try and dodge past their grasp as you begin to dart through their  sam oh god nine they got me they got me guys  matt as you run all of a sudden /none/ there’s a tug on your cloak and the same younger physician who had  told you to get out is clutching the back of your cloak and lifts you up off the ground “well then  someone’s going to play nice with the crownsguard” and turns and starts bringing you  towards the exit “you too outside”  sam oh no this couldn’t have gone better  travis am i in the room by myself  matt yes  travis can i cast disguise self and give myself the same sort of clerkorderly outfit as…  matt yeah easily  /town/ travis maybe not looking exactly like one of them but like them in a uniform  matt yeah  travis okay can i exit the room and come out into the hall  matt you exit out and the two other ones are looking a bit confused he’s currently dragging  nott who’s flailing on the edge of the cloak dangling out into the main area  travis get him out of here i walk past them towards the office where the doctor is  matt okay he goes and throws you out onto the street pushes you out caleb /none/ and goes “guard”  and begins pointing loudly over there down in the direction of where you tumbled and landed on the ground  liam wait so who’s where outside  matt you guys got shoved out into the front of the facility nott got tossed landed and  stumbled a few feet and they’re now shouting for the guard and pointing at nott  liam pointing at us okay  sam enemy of my enemy now  liam groans that still seems extreme we should just book it  sam are you fast all right fine i’m not leaving /none/ you i’m much faster than you  matt you guys start bolting  sam we’re going to start to run  matt as you guys run they don’t give chase because it’s not their job to do so but they  start shouting and shouting i want you both to roll stealth checks to try and see if you can  avoid the sight of the crownsguard that are in the process of responding to the shout  sam 15 from me  liam only a ten for me  matt okay as you guys dart into the nearby shadows /none/ plugging down a few alleyways you hear  some voices in the distance some conversations some shouting and then some footfalls that get  loud and then get a little softer and eventually a little softer and fade off you just  barely scraped by on that one  marisha and laura oh my god  matt you however darted off towards the open office and as soon as you glance in there you can  see there is a desk set up there is a chair there are a number of large books and stacks of  parchment it /none/ looks like there is a whole rack up top with various medicinal herbs and salves that  are categorized into small makeshift cubbies this is where a lot of the treatment seems to be mustered  travis can i turn and as i start to close the door behind me can i look down the hallway and  see if anybody is walking towards me in the hallway is it relatively clear  matt well it’s clear for the moment but the man who was just in this office just finished  throwing nott outside and is in the process /none/ of talking with the crownsguard you don’t know how  long you have until he returns  travis can i grab a handful of papers off the desk and put them under my shirt and start walking out  matt you palm a bunch and throw it in there all right you exit just as you see them returning to  the hallway with the physician straightening his outfit making his way in your direction doesn’t  even make eye contact with you just brushes by and shoulderchecks you which is hilarious  because the size of your visual is /none/ much smaller so it’s like impact “watch it” and was two  inches away but doesn’t seem to notice in the moment that he actually did so makes his way into  the office you hear the door close behind you and the two other clerks frustratingly start  scattering and making their way to the other chambers one of them is talking to the other  about “i don’t know what happened he went crazy and started spitting and was bleeding everywhere”  and they’re both making their way to the door where molly is in  travis that /town/ was very unruly i need to excuse myself for a moment i’ll head out of the infirmary  matt okay you head back out onto the street you are in that chamber for a while are you doing anything  taliesin how long has it been  travis i’m heading out of the infirmary and i’m going to start wrapping around the building  towards the side of the building that he was in  taliesin i’m seeing how is it possible to open the window  matt make an investigation check  taliesin god all these numbers i used /tavern/ to be good at but i’m not good at anymore ten  matt ten nothing easily does so you can try and pry one of the panes out but there’s a decent  chance it might break in the process if you’re not careful  taliesin that’s fine  matt you’re going to try you take one of your blades and you wedge it up underneath where the  metal bar is it’s holding the pane in place to see if you can wedge it out go ahead and make a  straight dexterity check  taliesin nope one  /none/ matt it shatters and breaks on both sides of the window you watch as the window shatters outward  taliesin i’m going to jump out of it  matt the pane itself is about that big so you’re going to take more of the window with you to do it  taliesin yeah that’s okay  matt all right you shoulderrollleap through shattering the window out of the infirmary  rolling into the alley you see this happen as molly is a chaotic spill of glass shards and  purple skin  travis run  matt you guys bolt at /none/ this point as you head back you’ve now seen the guards that have just  run off to go after nott hear the shatter and turn around to begin some of them to double back to  where the sound of the glass breaking came from  travis can i point off in a different direction than molly’s running since i look like a hospital  clerk nurse  matt make a deception check  taliesin carry me i’m going to jump into your arms while you do that  laura no no he’s pointing the other direction  matt /none/ it’s too late  taliesin wait no i’m trying to understand the scene here i thought they were looking at him  matt they are  laura they’re looking at him but you were running away  taliesin well if i’m already because i didn’t know if i was just standing  matt okay  travis 15  matt 15 the guards approach and they both look antsy but they see you pointing away and they  both head in the direction that you were heading them off towards as molly’s about to leap into  your arms  taliesin /none/ i was already towards…  matt you guys have managed to find yourselves back into the chaotic evening of the streets of zadash  liam i think i was imagining a small momandpop place with two physicians but like 50 people in  white coats came out  matt it’s like six  liam i think it was more like 72 matt let’s be honest  marisha in the meantime me and jester are like what’s taking them so long  liam oh that only took five minutes to go that bad  marisha he took an hour to cosplay /none/ his dick  matt which is still there by the way  taliesin i know i’m going to save that for later  travis as we’re walking back can i start looking over the papers looking for some sort of  signature that says richter or prucine or anything  matt yeah as you guys make your way back to the leaky tap to eventually meet up going through the  paperwork unfortunately none of them have anything that signifies the highrichter they all  seem to be various quick notes on bones breaks and resets on various illnesses that /none/ have come  through and treatments that have been applied keeping tabs on return visits it’s all various  notes of  sam anything from his dad  matt nothing from lord sutan unfortunately  travis yeah it was just on top of the desk  matt if you had possibly searched a little longer you could have maybe found something you  think but given the circumstances it did not occur  travis i don’t really have anything to hold him crown of madness  matt so you didn’t find anything you wanted to and you probably definitely fucked /none/ up a few  people’s recovery routine but that’s fine you guys eventually find your way back to the leaky  tap your monk and your cleric are waiting for you and you watch as these four individuals walk  in looking a bit haggard  travis great success went off without a hitch  marisha why are you covered in mayonnaise and egg  laura why do you smell like beer  marisha and hot sauce is that hot sauce  taliesin that is in fact hot sauce i’m going to empty out my canteen into the fire  /none/ laura gross  taliesin i was making a distraction  travis we found ren we  sam he’s heavily guarded there was no way to get close enough  laura did you go in and say “can i speak to ren” and then somebody else go in his office while  somebody was in the front asking to talk to ren  travis that’s actually exactly what happened it just didn’t go as well as you thought it might go  laura oh okay  travis great minds think alike though jester  taliesin fools seldom differ  marisha you /none/ guys look real defeated over here you look palpably defeated  sam we almost had to kill an orderly  marisha what  sam it’s very embarrassing  liam that’s true it came very close  travis how’d it go for you two  laura oh well we cased out his house we found a big tree that we can hop the fence with oh and  we bought this rope and this grapple so that we can climb  liam so you looked at the house and then you went shopping  laura well so that we can break /none/ into the house yes  liam tight that’s tight  taliesin i jumped through a window  marisha you what  taliesin full glass it was great  laura is that what all of these things are  taliesin well some of those are sequins but yes essentially  marisha all right  sam it was a good dry run for our real heist that we’re going to be doing in a day so we’re working  out the kinks…  travis not promising  taliesin it’s not about the plan it’s about the desire to improvise  laura i /none/ cast cure wounds on molly  taliesin oh yay i had very little so thank you for that  marisha you know this could lead back to make it look suspicious if we go after lord sutan if his  son was just broken into right  sam well don’t worry about that because they definitely saw our real faces  liam not my face  sam oh yes you’re right they only saw my real face so maybe that’s okay  marisha he’s going to know his medical notes are missing right  travis it’s an infirmary they got /none/ to see terrible people in there all the time  liam yeah agreed in hospitals you see all nature of people  marisha all right okay  laura yeah nobody mentioned anything about needing handwriting right  sam no no  liam no there was not a lot of  laura no talk of his father at all right  liam there was not a lot of talking in fact  taliesin it was probably just an attempt to steal medicinals  marisha sure sure all right  laura well we have ren’s handwriting we could potentially put a note /none/ in somebody’s house with  his stuff but i don’t know if that’s what the plan is  marisha well i mean that works because as dolan said these fancy people tend to get other people  to write their mail and do their paperwork for them so…  liam well it could add credibility to the tapestry that we’re trying to weave here the goal  is still to get into sutan elder’s home and get this seal  marisha yeah that never changed  liam within the writings that we forge we could include some by the junior /none/ sutan so that would  add some credibility to what we’re doing  travis might get us in past that outer wall at least  liam we still have to figure out what we are going to if we are starting at sutan’s house  then… we don’t have any writing of the highrichter’s we are either trying to focus on  finding that somehow or going on what you were discussing which is creating the appearance of an  underling or a forhire of the highrichter’s or some kind of code saying that they are  communicating with sutan /none/ elder on behalf of the highrichter yeah  marisha nott over here knows a little bit of thieves’ cant  sam do you need me to write something  marisha it would look shifty  sam i could do that  marisha i’m just saying from my experience normally if you’re trying to do a coup  liam experience as a what  marisha as a rebellious teenage woman in my experience normally if you’re trying to do  something bad you’re not like “dear diary i did this bad thing signed beauregard” you get what  i’m putting down /none/  travis yeah it’d be obvious  marisha correct we want to look if it’s too obvious it’s the opposite of convincing  travis sign it somebody else’s name  marisha this guy goes by the gentleman because he is smart that’s all i’m saying  liam we want to put information in sutan’s house elder right we could have some sort of  writing that is not from the highrichter but that says “hr would prefer the plans to go into motion  laura “hr wants a meeting with you”  marisha “spoke to the myriad” yeah…  taliesin /none/ “finalized the plans”  liam i propose that we make it seem like sutan and the highrichter were conspiring to have  orentha killed so we have a note put into sutan’s house that says “on behalf” from an  intermediary “on behalf of hr wants the plan to go into motion immediately and that orentha will  be out for the festival tonight  laura the big o we should say big o  liam the big o that is good  sam we are so much better than the other people at planning like this  laughter  /none/ liam then we plant that in sutan elder’s house when we successfully quietly break in  laura i’ll start writing that note right now  sam in block letters can’t be traced to anyone that sort of thing  liam well it’s an intermediary so does not have to look  marisha it doesn’t really matter  laura i’ll make it look crisp and  sam make it look like evil calligraphy  laura yeah like evil handwriting  liam this letter perhaps on its own is not enough but with the seal if we have a matching  letter /none/ planted in hr’s home  laura yeah got your messages i will move the meeting up and the big o is going to die for sure  sam ooh yeah  marisha and a little bribery if we’re trying to go for something  laura but where are we going to get this money you keep talking about  taliesin we can just promise them money  laura here’s the thing having seen people be bribed before you need very large sums of money  for bribing especially with rich people they’re not going to need 500 gold to do /none/ this sort of  thing they want 5000 gold for this sort of thing  marisha it depends if you’re just handing money off to an assassin if it’s a lowly level person  might not need much doesn’t need to be the whole amount just needs to be a payment maybe  sam a check  laura a check an iou “on behalf of hr “  liam keep your writing very plain not immensely charming  sam traceable  liam no i mean not charming like the way you speak  laura so no hearts above the i’s /none/ then  liam no no  laura i write “on behalf of hr “  liam yeah that’s good  laura what comes after that  marisha the big o thing the plan against the big o  liam “hr would like the plan to be moved forward”  marisha “it will commence “  travis “as discussed”  marisha “commence as discussed”  sam sounds official  laura “on behalf of hr the plan “  liam “the plan is moving up to tomorrow night at the festival”  laura “the plan is moving up to tomorrow night at /none/ the festival”  liam “the moment has come and it is time for us to seize it”  laura that’s what i write  matt okay you work out the logistics of that letter  marisha and it sounds super boss  laura “yours truly forever and ever your bff “  sam no no  laura no  sam take out the part where you say “do you like me if so check this box”  laughter  taliesin i thought that tied the whole thing together  laura yeah i thought it was good  travis and no /none/ perfume on the letter  marisha aw you beat me to it no signing it with a kiss  laura if i fold it up like a little triangle just a simple  taliesin what kind of dog  sam what  marisha what kind of dog  laura oh wait should i fold it or should i scroll it  sam scroll it because we’re going to  matt the guard dog that was outside of the home  taliesin there’s a guard dog  matt it was a mastiff  taliesin it was a mastiff was it a /town/ wellkept dog or was it a dog of pride or just a dog of  matt from what you guys saw of the mastiff it wasn’t a show dog by any means but it wasn’t a  street dog they’re just using for the moment  travis was it a talking mastiff  matt one way to find out  taliesin does it look like the sort of dog that you can actually be proud of or is it just a utility  matt it looks like it’s a utility dog you’ve seen some dogs go around with members of /none/ the  crownsguard before as part of the general it’s more for an intimidation tactic they’re rarely  ever utilized but the presence of a dog just make some people especially those who work in darker  categories unsettled  taliesin we have a cat  marisha can the cat become a mastiff  laura can the cat get the dog  liam to chase it away  laura yeah  taliesin then someone would have to get the dog back  sam just shoot the dog with an arrow and kill it  taliesin i’m just talking about getting /none/ the dog no  travis nott  taliesin somebody’s going to have to retrieve the dog if the dog goes running  marisha here’s the deal nott  liam we don’t want a dead dog  marisha yeah we need to leave no trace the only way this gets pulled off is if  taliesin this is the subtle one  marisha is if no one thinks anyone was there ever  sam show the dog your dick  taliesin i’m not showing anybody there’s no more of that what if the dog runs the guard will  have to /none/ get the dog back  laura they’ll chase after the dog  liam yeah frumpkin can do that very well  laura we can try that if it doesn’t work then we try to jump up and over  liam also sausages are very inexpensive so we have that as a plan b  marisha we also have good ol’ fjord who can always disguise himself as a guard  laura and relieve him  marisha correct  laura say that somebody really wants him over at the party  liam are they private guards though or are they crownsguard /none/  marisha and matt they were crownsguard  matt they were assigned  liam do you know what nott if you want one idea if you want to help is you can also write a  note in your thieves’ cant it should be vague on details but a message from the myriad or don’t  even get that specific but write in thieves’ cant a note saying that everything is in place  for the festival  marisha i think that’s a good idea  sam all right sure i need a few papers  marisha a few papers /none/ are always good  matt all right as you guys work your way through preparing this letter condensing your plots for  the next evening and eventually find yourself to a night’s rest in preparation for the next day’s  events we’re going to take a break  liam no but i think we should go back to the hospital one more time  matt laughs fucking dd  laura watching your face matt as all that was happening you were like what are they doing  matt those are my favorite moments of the game i’m like i don’t /none/

throat oh caleb nott here i have a favor to  ask of you /none/ i absconded with some items recently and i wanted you to take a look at them with your  keen eye  liam where did you get these items  sam it was not i didn’t break in anywhere i mean we did but it was cool because other people  were with me it’s when we went down into the basement to scout around for other entrances into  the bottom of the leaky tap  liam under the leaky tap and you found  sam i found a skeleton that had these bracelets on her him they  /tavern/ liam you found a skeleton  sam yeah i dont know i didnt really have time to look at it  liam you found a dead person  sam a very old dead person could be ancient  liam yeah but its not really typical to keep a dead like a skeleton in your basement  sam i didnt think about that but yes  travis nor in your closet  liam well thats a topic for the group were staying in an inn where there was a dead person  sam i dont think its haunted or anything it /none/ just seemed like someone it was stuffed way in  the corner behind some boxes  like someone wanted to  liam yeah thats worse thats not better thats worse  sam i didnt i mean im really just interested in these  laughter  liam okay well thats somewhat unsettling but show me these items that you have  sam these are just bracelets that i found i was wondering if you could use your magic skills  liam i place them down on the bed and go through the process of casting identify on them it takes  /none/ about ten minutes  matt okay as you finish the focus you glance down at them extending your consciousness to see  if theres any residual magic energy theyre not enchanted but they are made of a very nice solid  platinum with a gold spiral lay on them once you pull the dust off so they’re probably worth a  little bit of money  liam you should sell these these are not little and adorable like buttons  sam no but theyre shiny and nice  liam do you want to wear them  sam ooh maybe i /tavern/ could  liam well you could what  sam are they big  liam are they huge for a goblin’s little wrists  matt for a goblin’s wrists theyre pretty big looks like theyre more they may have been made  for a more masculine figure’s wrists probably or a thickarmed lass  liam maybe your ankle or calf you could put them on or sell them and then you could put them to use  sam all right okay  liam im still a little disturbed that theres a dead person under this inn that were in right  /none/ now  sam i understand well we can go back and i can show you if youd like but it didnt seem like  liam well i take your word for it that its there i dont need to go poking about  sam how do you do that where you look at something and you just see what it is  liam well it is a spell that i learned when i was  sam its so cool its very impressive  liam you could potentially learn this as well  sam really  liam of course if you /none/ apply yourself  sam i dont know you know so many spells and so many things youre very strong im continually  impressed by you i must say how strong would you say you are on a scale of one to 20  liam how do you mean im not very strong nott i do have things that i want to do with my life  and i mean to apply myself and study and find knowledge  sam is that the way youll get even stronger through study and books  liam ja that is the best way to /none/ do that for anyone  sam would magical items help further your abilities or blessings  liam that seems like an abstract question there are certainly very useful things that can be found  in this world you never know  sam all right  liam are you okay  sam oh im fine im just fascinated by all things wizard and i want you to succeed thats  all i have great faith in you i know youll do great things and i just want to help you get  there  liam well thank you friend  sam /none/ sure yes anything anything to help the cause  liam well maybe we go to bed and tomorrow we dont tear the roof down off of every building we  go into again yeah  sam okay sounds good  liam so i take out my silver thread and i start casting the alarm spell on our room before bed  and then i go to bed  matt all righty anybody else have anything to do before the evenings rest or are you happy to  continue the next day  travis next day for me  laura shouting /none/ pillow fight  marisha beau gets a little too aggressive with the pillow fight  laura ow okay were done  marisha sorry sorry  liam mess with the bull get the horns  matt all right so as the evening comes to a close the next morning greets you on a somewhat  chilled misty morning the sky gray but the light is out you can see a faint mist is burning  off of the streets in the early morning like six or sevenish you all gather yourselves is there  anything you wish to accomplish during the /dung/ day or do you wish to jump ahead to the meeting of the  afternoon the evening  marisha should we get some awesome allblack clothes  laura maybe we should so that we stealth better  marisha yeah something a little bit more stealthy  laura we can put it in the pink bag  marisha oh i like that  taliesin i was thinking some carnival masks from the other direction  travis yeah all black looks like youre up to no good  liam yeah and if you are actually in the dark you cant tell the /none/ difference and if youre in  the light you look like a ninja so i think were good maybe  marisha i see what youre saying yeah  taliesin everyone’s going to be pretty fancydressed  laura the carnival is going on today  matt yeah the festival is happening this evening  marisha do we know anything about this festival like culturally do they wear masks  matt i mean the harvest is celebrated at different points and in a few weeks is the  official harvest end festival this is done in advance its more of a private /town/ event that is for  the more elite some folks come in from out of town from local smaller townships that are pretty  well off and trying to rub elbows with the local elite its a festival that contains food music  drink youve never been to one of course and youve heard of it from the time you spent in  zadash youve never seen it but youve seen folks take care through the street towards the  event and it seems to be fairly like a more subdued mardi gras colors but the colors are more  /none/ reds and browns and golds they have masks theyll wear for it but they arent full face just  habitual eye masks only some will some folks dont get fully into the spirit  marisha i think we should go shopping  taliesin masks on sticks  marisha masks on sticks  laura well were not actually going to the fancy gala so we probably dont need the fancy stuff  because its just for the rich people  marisha but will it get us through the gate  laura well i figure for all of us to get in /none/ we should go through the sewers probably  taliesin if someone stops you if you have a mask they know why youre there  liam yeah in a pinch  laura sure  liam a lot is riding on sutan and the highrichter going to this festival  laura yeah  liam thats it thats all  laughter  taliesin i was really expecting more there  liam no its just pessimism  laura lets go buy some masks then  marisha are you afraid theyre not party people  liam well i worry that if we break into sutans /none/ house and stuff a bunch of letters there but the  highrichter stays in with a tummy ache then it all falls apart  marisha well then we go from there  laura theres no point in worrying about things you cant change yet caleb  marisha shes got a point  taliesin be the chaos you want to see in the world  travis yeah no point in worrying it only makes it hurt twice  liam yeah lead the way ill be the caboose  matt all right who’s helming the expedition to acquire costume pieces  travis /none/ molly  matt molly go ahead and make an investigation check  laughter  matt ill say because of your dress ill give you advantage on this  taliesin thank you  marisha show us where melrose is  taliesin looking for melrose 11  matt 11 it takes you the better part of the morning about noon you manage to find a place  that will sell similar outfits since a lot of them are either custommade for the individuals  that are going its hard to find a place there is no shop that sells fancy clothes to /none/ the random  folks who arent going to the event but you manage to find a few individuals that can cobble  together a few masks and basic attire because its a quick build its going to be a little  pricier than normal cost so the commission will take the better part of the afternoon and will be  ready by sundown for enough outfits for six of you or accoutrements  taliesin i was about to say i dont need much  matt youll be fine its just a mask id say between all of you for the /none/ time the materials  and the construction of it it’ll run you about three gold pieces  taliesin ill pay that  travis youll pay for all of it  taliesin yeah i will get reimbursed at the end  liam i’ll pick up some sausages  matt okay how many sausages do you want  liam oh just the one string of them four or five  sam maybe two strings  liam two strings in case  laughter  matt in case you get hungry fair enough okay thats going to put you back a silver  laura /none/ oh and im going to write another letter that says something about the knights of requital  that says like what should it be im glad to be working with you you sure are nice  travis what about a signoff like the knights of requital are rising  sam what if you take a letter and just sign it “knights of requital” and rip off the rest so who  knows what it was its just from them  laura yeah ill end it with the big red door the knights of requital then rip it and then it /none/  is just the bottom part and leave it in the highrichters house  marisha leave it in the trash thats not bad thats not bad  laura oh can somebody burn the edge like the rest was in the fire or something oh and then we  can put it in the fireplace like the rest of the letter was burned  marisha man that is the oldest trick in the book sure  laura caleb burn just these edges here  liam okay put it down on the ground  laura but just the edges dont set the /none/ whole thing on fire because i spent a really long time  writing that little bit  liam ah well then use a hearth fire or something because i will probably put that into  flames also alternatively would we want maybe something instead that said that the knights are  ready for this evening’s pursuits and they’re to support any endeavors as needed great  highrichter it is time for change  laura i write all of that okay fine  marisha dont write “the knights” though just write the little symbol  laura yeah then ill put the /none/ symbol but im also going to keep this one to put in the  fireplace because i think it will be really cool  liam yes the two together but i worry that just the one piece she could have written it down on a  list of things she does not like its not very conclusive but the two together  sam she doesnt like red doors she doesnt like the knights of requital  laura now we have those letters im going to keep track im putting them in the side

matt you have no idea where ulog is or if hes /none/ in the vicinity unfortunately all right so  liam we should also youre invisible we should also discuss whos going in whos outside how we  are tackling each house  laura i should definitely go into lord sutans place because i have this really fun spell that  lets me find things so i could find the seal  liam how does it work  laura i go i want to find this wax seal and it will help me find the one that’s closest  liam then youre right you should go in nott you should go in /none/ because youre going to pick  locks ja  sam yes  liam if anything is locked i strongly believe that i should go in as well because these are two  very wealthy powerful people and there could be magical  laura youre going to steal some stuff  liam only if that is you know easy to do  marisha once again we should leave no trace that we were there  sam dont worry about that ill eat everything we leave behind  taliesin now im really worried about it actually  travis ill be out front /tavern/ i can be a crownsguard if i need to  taliesin and i can be in the back and be drunk and lookout  sam which is our first house that were attacking  travis lord sutan  sam and we know that theres a guard and a dog out there  marisha correct so first  sam so you guys need to distract the guard  marisha with the cat weve got the cat plan  sam and the sausage  liam and the sausage just in case  laura sausage for the guard cat for the dog  /tavern/ liam regardless even if this goes bellyup we just disappear you know we have no ties to this  we walk away yeah we just get out with our skins even if things go as badly as they did at  the hospital and then we go we just walk away  marisha yeah the last thing we want is for the crownsguard to think that this was all us  laura where are we meeting ulog  marisha in front of the  marisha and travis song and supper inn  liam oh also frumpkin is up here in /none/ my sort of scarf position and i bring him down in my lap  and i take the sausages out and i sort of like knead one of the sausages in my hand a bit and i  say you know im sorry but the next time that you go off to your pocket place and come back  this will be gone and i start squishing sausage grease into his hair and rubbing it down his back  so that he smells like sausage  taliesin thats a very good plan  liam i love you very much so /none/ thank you for this okay  all angry cat noises  laura do you want to eat him even more now  liam some other time perhaps  sam ill drink instead  matt you gather the outfits that were commissioned for you you have your materials as  the day grows later eventually the sun begins to crest over the western mountain range the sky  though cloudy still the colors begin to shift to the oranges and purples of dusk you begin to see  carriages come through the streets and make their way towards the trispire district /none/  laura oh i wonder if we can hide under the carriages and just ride in  marisha i was going to say can we hop a ride  matt one of the carriages just passed you and its about a block up the way if you want to try  and catch up  marisha no that brings a lot of attention chasing after a carriage  laura its all about trying to get into the sewer system  sam cant we just go to the sewers  laura lets just go to the sewers  matt all right /town/ as you guys head back towards the entryway to the sewers where you had previously  been with your various outfits and attire you can see now theres not two crownsguards theres  a single crownsguard at the moment you approach and you see theyre not directly against the  grate theyre across the street it doesnt appear to be watched at the moment  sam the gate  matt the entranceway into the sewers  laura maybe i can go talk to the guard distract him  sam it seems like theyre not looking right now  laura oh /dung/ hes not even looking at the gate  sam no theyre not looking we can just go  matt well hes not looking at the entranceway to the sewer  marisha that doesnt mean that wont change in 30 seconds  laura its dark outside too  matt yes but there are lanterns and stuff up on the side of the street  marisha do you want to distract him and well meet you on the other side  laura oh sure ill go meet you at the sewer entrance on the other side  marisha okay nott or caleb /none/ can send you a message  laura okay i walk up to the guard  matt okay evening  laura evening how are you doing today  matt i am well how are you  laura pretty good i was wondering if you could answer a question for me  matt

best direction  matt try the pentamarket probably  laura /town/ the pentamarket um okay can you tell me exactly where that is because im not familiar  with the area  matt make a persuasion check  laura oh no oh thats okay  19  matt all right so down this way and he starts giving you the full playbyplay of the  street corners to the pentamarket where a candy shop is that you had missed earlier so now you  know theres a candy shop in zadash  laura yay  matt as its happening what did you roll  travis 12  marisha 15  liam /none/ eight  sam natural one  laura oh come on  taliesin 19  matt hold on so a natural one eight 19 15 okay natural one’s tricky  sam plus eight  matt still a natural one but yeah that brings it to nine as you guys begin to quickly slide in  one after the other nott as youre rushing down youre glancing off because you hear them talk  about candy for a second over the side  sam ooh  matt as you rush down the side whack you hit your head and give out a /none/ natural instinct a  pained squeak as you do the guard whos talking to jester goes “wha”  laura fake coughs loudly can you help me i think i’m choking  matt make a deception check  laura oh no seven  matt seven  laura fake coughs loudly  matt “hold just a second”  laura oh no i can’t breathe at all though  matt he begins walking over to the sewer edge he steps over and begins to glance down  laura i fall over on the ground and really like choking sounds  matt he’s looking /town/ back at you like  laura choking sounds  liam i send frumpkin screeching away from us up the street clattering into anything  matt from where out of the sewer you mean  liam yeah out of the sewer yeah i pop him back up  matt as soon as frumpkin he kicks and  gasps  matt misses  laughter  sam it’s the same guy its the same guy  liam caleb appears at the sewer like pennywise the clown  marisha why is that their natural response in this town  matt well he got scared /none/ by the cat the first guy was a dick this guy was yells like kicking  wildly anyway he falls back and frumpkin runs off he’s like grunts it seems to be enough to  take him off the scent of nott and he turns around “miss” he walks up and helps you up  laura oh it was my spit i was choking on my own spit  matt right all right well go get your candy have a good night  laura thank you very much for all of your help  matt sighs he goes back to /none/ his post you guys make your way through the sewer back up through  the tintersection  travis mindful of the damn rats  marisha ratballoons  liam i held back two minutes to let frumpkin quietly come back  matt all right fair enough frumpkin does slowly make his way back to join you you make your way  towards the gate and without issue are entered into the trispire you make your way towards the  side of the alleyway where the  laura oh we didn’t meet the guy at the song and supper  matt you /tavern/ did not  marisha oh fuck  sam what guy  marisha shit we were supposed to go fucking meet ulog damn it  taliesin we’re so good at this  matt jester do you want to go do that  laura yeah i just remembered it i’m going to the song and supper inn  taliesin we’re going to sit in the sewer like so much clown  marisha we recapped this at the break too damn it  matt you guys are sitting there waiting for jester to show up and meet you to let you out  /dung/ sam i cast message a few times we’re here where are you  travis where letterr letteru  matt you however you make your way to the song and supper and on the inside you can see  nervously at a table in a dark cloak ulog “what the” gets up and meets you outside shoves you  back out there and you both begin to walk sidebyside “i was waiting here long enough”  laura we were waiting for you it’s so weird that we totally missed you though  matt make a deception check  laura well well /dung/ well 11  matt he goes “right well where’s the rest of your team”  laura they are here’s the thing how rich do you look how rich does he look  matt he looks down and he has fairly plain dark clothing for nightstealthing he has like a  single looks like a gold chain of some kind with a single yellowish amberorange bead on it that  looks like it’s worth a gold or two dark greenbrown cloak it’s hard to see the color  this late at night he doesn’t look super rich  laura can i /none/ put some of my costume on him  matt yeah  laura i’ll put some of my festive wear on him  matt you put some of the festive wear on him it’s all not at all fitted for him and it looks  like a kid who has outgrown his snowoutfit and he’s like “this is humiliating”  laura it’ll get you in the door don’t worry here put this mask on  matt he’s seething beneath it you can see him grinding his teeth but he follows you  nevertheless  taliesin candythemed too  laura oh that’s /none/ great  matt you make your way to the gate once more the guards there one of them walks up and the same  one from earlier gives you a nod “hold”  laura guest of honor for the night he’s a comedian  matt make another deception check  laura come on it is being so mean seven god damn it  matt he goes “a comedian tell me a joke”  marisha oh come on ulog  matt ulog looks at you with the mask back at the guard “um”  marisha it’s open mic night you got /none/ this  laughter  matt he goes “what do you call the king on his birthday” the crownsguard goes “i don’t know  what do you call a king on his birthday” “an arsehole” the guard goes  laura here’s the thing he’s not a joketelling kind of comedian he’s more of a farce kind of  comedian physical comedy it’s more like a jester if you will and i push him and so he  falls down see  matt impact noise at which point the two guards go  laugh  laura he’s so good he really sells /none/ it  matt ulog like gets off the ground and glares at you this very furious fiery stare and then gets up  and then stumbles again and falls on the ground flat again the guard goes  laughs all right get in  ulog now has like a bloody nose and as you ushers him in he looks back “oh we’re going to  talk later”  laura but i got you in the door right  matt you eventually make your way over to the edge of the alley coming up to the hatch that  leads you /none/ out of the sewer there you guys see the two approaching shapes of jester and ulog ulog  looking festive if the wear is a bit tiny making his hair and beard poof out of the sides of  the mask  marisha pigeon coos  sam where have you been  laura i got ulog  marisha oh shit we almost forgot about ulog  laura i know  marisha oh shit  sam what’s ulog’s job in this  laura i have no freaking clue hey ulog what do you want to do  matt “well first off /none/ i’m pretty keen at infiltration i have a long past of doing sort of  the breaking and entering thing plus i want to be there when this happens have a personal stake  travis yeah he should be a part of the team that goes in  laura okay  marisha how well do you know lord sutan’s place and the area  matt “i know the area alright”  marisha all right  laura we cased it earlier  matt “do you think you know where he lives”  laura yes  matt “all right that’s all we /none/ need the rest we can all do lead on”  liam can i insight check him just get a feel for that  matt yeah go for it  liam that is 17  matt 17  sam whispers whispers  taliesin mysterious whispers  sam dd beyond  travis and far cry 5  marisha yeah  sam far cry 5 it’s five better than far cry 0  travis or four better than the original  marisha the fiviest  sam yes  travis takes place in america  sam montana  liam guys it’s larkin  matt /none/ well there goes the campaign as you guys make your way through the city streets you can  see the closer you get to the silken terrace for one the usual silk banners that adorn the various  edges of the streets have been changed from the usual white silk banners to bright yellows bright  browns bright reds the colors of autumn are now starting to show and appear throughout the vicinity  marisha i hate the color yellow  travis really why  marisha i just hate it  laura it would look really pretty on you  /none/ taliesin i don’t think that’s true  sam no i don’t think so  laura i think yellow would look good on you  taliesin the blue works stick with it you know  sam more of a spring…  matt you also hear the music begin to swell at the various performing bands towards the center  where this gala is you can see all the banners leaning in the center space the sunset colors  have vanished and now the night sky holds above the crownsguard are clustered in greater numbers  in the trispire specifically to keep /town/ a perimeter around the event as you glance off to the  entrance gate where you were you can see there’s now stationed more towards that space since you  originally passed through more musicians are arriving some locally some appear to be from  other areas within the actual empire the social elite are gathering in the center of the silken  terrace and you can now see the small carriages are stopping and letting other individuals out to  join the crowds the mingling beginning you can already see about 60 or 70 people with more still  /none/ arriving they all have their various colors and masks on they’re all grabbing drinks and laughing  and seeing old friends and introducing themselves to new people they haven’t met before some of  them live in the trispire some that live throughout and beyond  marisha any of them look familiar  matt make a perception check  marisha don’t fuck me gil meh you kind of fucked me there  liam may i also do the same thing  marisha ten  matt make a perception check  liam no no good eight  matt unfortunately you’re too /none/ far away and the masks obscure any of sort of details you’re  unable to see anyone you recognize per se but you do see that there are long tables that mark  the perimeter that are already holding already preset glasses of wine and ciders you can see the  central tower of the triumph chime sits glowing right at the front and center of this gala it’s  all surrounding the base of it and up in a spiral you can see lanterns and similar colors of  autumn that spiral up the front of it you guys /none/ begin to carefully and out of sight make your  way towards the estate of lord sutan please make stealth checks everybody  liam this is a lot of people  laura oh wait who sucks  marisha fuck  liam i rolled well  laura who hasn’t rolled yet taliesin i give you a blessing  taliesin all right advantage that’s awesome  travis 14  marisha why does it feel like you roll crappier when you’re lower level 13  liam 17  sam 13  laura 20  taliesin 19  travis uh  matt pretty good /town/ spread you guys duck in between avoiding being seen and blend in with the  crowd as you pass other individuals that are making their way to the actual gala event there  are nods and smiles occasional laugh as folks are conversing and chatting as they pass you make  your way over to the outskirts of the gilded willows beyond the skyscape park and where the  constellation bridge tower stands to see for many of you the first time the threestory dark  wood home of lord sutan the marble pillars mark the cornerstones of where the /none/ metallic iron fence  gate matches the perimeter there’s a singular tree and still there are two guards posted at one  and the same guard with the dog at the other  marisha same guard  sam must be getting tired  liam i’m sorry can you set the scene two guards at one end and one at the other  matt well it’s been a day later  marisha are we catching them around the same time this is his shift same watch  matt seems to be  marisha all right  liam and it’s like cornercorner /none/ or front and back or…  matt if look at the if the building’s a square the house is mainly built as a rectangle there’s  the front door and the back where the cellar door is and there’s the perimeter fence  liam okay  matt in the front there are two guards in the back where the gate and the cellar door is  there’s a singular guard and his dog the tree is up on this side  laura but there’s still a gate  marisha all the way around with the spikes  liam the guard /none/ with the dog is within this perimeter of fence  matt it’s just on the interior of it just within the gate  marisha and the gate is closed  matt correct  laura how wide are the openings in the gate does it look like the mastiff could get through the  openings in the wroughtiron fence  matt probably not no  marisha but he can still be enough of a distraction to get the guard to chase the dog  while we get in if we can get the dog  liam to the front side of /none/ the home  marisha maybe to the front side  liam maybe temporary though  sam we can get in through the gate and then we get to the tree or we’re going to go straight into  the cellar  marisha that’s what i was thinking go into the cellar  laura we could use the tree to get over the fence and then run to the cellar  marisha as soon as the dog chases away the cat  liam yeah but what about our exit because we have to come back out  marisha well  sam /none/ we worry about that later  liam no no we worry about that now  marisha maybe that’s when fjord can come and relieve the guards  travis i can do that now  marisha or he can do that now but how do we get fjord on the other side of the gate  laura he walks up to him and say  sam that’s very risky now because what if the guards says “i don’t know you” you know then the  plan never starts if we do that at the end at least we have a fighting /none/ chance  travis that’s true i could wait  liam i don’t like being stuck in there though  laura ulog what do you think you’re really good at this  matt “who’s staying outside”  travis i am  taliesin i am  matt the two of you all right  marisha what were those guards’ names there were so many guards  taliesin what were those guards’ names  laura that was at the highrichter’s house that wasn’t here  travis yeah that was at the highrichter’s  marisha yeah but as long as you do a guard /none/ that’s semirecognizable  matt “if we can manage if what you’re saying about this tree we can possibly scoot past their  visual range and not have to worry about it and just use that as a backup”  laura right  matt “but we got to climb the tree”  laura we can climb a tree we’re good at that  travis the tree means worst case scenario  laura and i got this grapple so we can swing across to the roof on the other side  matt “all right those that are staying at the base the /none/ rest of us let’s get to climbing”  taliesin if we hear the dog bark we can walk by  liam also i have another question how far from the fence to the home  matt it’s about five feet  liam five feet only  marisha yeah but spikes  liam i’m rethinking if frumpkin gets away from this dog in the beginning he can run outside the  fence and he will not be far from me i can stay in touch with him so when it’s time to leave i  can have frumpkin reenter the yard /none/ and create mayhem a second time  laura or let him create it the first time because we might not need it  liam we might not but if we have no other option and we’re trying to get out and there’s guards in  both places frumpkin can come in and create mayhem again anyway just an option  sam okay  matt we get to the top you use your little cat thing to distract it preferably the other side of  the fence  liam hes just a cat  matt right your cat on the other /none/ side of the fence while theyre faced and focused in that  direction we make our ascent  laura we swing it over somebody needs to make a loud noise when we throw the grapple over  sam you can cough or something  laura so that it doesnt make a clang sound that they hear  matt that might be on one of you  liam a natural sound  matt all right  sam i will signal you when we are grapple throwing  marisha all right  taliesin if you also hear me make the same sound /none/ again that means trouble  laura i could maybe use like thaumaturgy to create a thunder sound  sam ooh thats good  laura if it happens at the same time  matt actually not a bad idea  laura okay ill do that  liam hows the weather is it clear or grey  laura sometimes thunder happens out of nowhere  matt its cloudythe sky itself is cloudy and has been even though the storm blew by its  still pretty heavy cloud cover  laura oh good  marisha all right up the tree  taliesin if /none/ you hear me make noise  matt those who are climbing the tree athletics checks please  marisha ill go first so i can try and help anyone else as i go up can i do that  matt yeah you can do that so beau goes first  marisha athletics or acrobatics  matt for climbing well say athletics  marisha whimpers  matt it doesnt have a lot of branches  marisha but parkour  laura do we get advantage because beaus helping us  marisha thats not great  liam well shes got to get up there /none/ first  marisha i got to get up there  liam she didnt roll that good  marisha eight  matt eight well youre not helping anybody chuckles you get partway up and ulog is  actually like grunting hes doing fine so he pushes you up the rest of the way  marisha give me a boost  laura shh  marisha whispers sorry  sam i rolled an 18  matt you climb up fine skittering up past them you actually climb over beau and ulog to get to  the top first  sam watch my nails /none/  laura i rolled 11  matt 11 thats fine you manage to get up there  and caleb  liam 17  sam ooh  matt you guys all get up there beau is the last to arrive  marisha pants  sam i thought you were a monk of some sort  marisha im sprinter im not an endurance person okay  matt its one if those things too where she starts first but each person keeps putting their  feet in her face on the way up  sam youre all legs and no arms  matt /none/ okay you guys get up to the top of the tree  youre up in the branches in the bow at the top you can see now its a beautiful view of  the gala in the distance you can see the three towers all arcing up all lit from underneath  from the lanterns and the light that have been significantly brightened for the events of the  evening you have a clear shot of the rooftop which is at a slight decline from this current  position its about ten feet from you and about three feet down /none/ below you can see there are two  smokestacks that look like theyre attached to fire places that might be good indicators of  places to connect the rope whos throwing the rope  laura should i try it  marisha youre strongest  sam what is this why do  laura its a grapple connected to a rope  sam all right  laura so i hand the other side of the rope to ulog so it doesnt fall  matt he takes it hes like all right you got to be pretty good at aiming this  sam /none/ yeah are you  matt its about 15 20 feet from here  laura well im strong  matt but can you aim it  laura yeah but youre weak arent you  sam i dont know i feel like im more precise than you but no youre strong you go for it  laura no but youre precise  sam i dont  liam frumpkin is pacing back and forth just outside the fence  sam parchment boulder shears  laura yeah on three  sam yes on three one two three okay youre throwing it  laura okay /none/ ill throw it  matt so go ahead and roll a d20 and add your strength modifier  sam ooh strength  laura oh that was good okay  11 no 12  matt you throw it tink tink  laura thunder

not staying on  matt it didnt manage to it got over to the roof but it didnt /none/ catch anything  marisha oh god  sam reel it back in reel it back in  marisha dont let it get caught  laura i do another thunder sound right when i pull it so it doesnt make noise  matt okay so you pull it and it scrapes falls and then dangles down you manage to pull it up a  little bit dangle it up yeah  sam give me that give me that  laura here it is a strength thing though  sam squeaks  matt are you just throwing it  sam yes natural /none/ one  laughter  matt all right so  sam weve lost our grapple  laura no no ulog was holding  onto the end of it  matt he was holding the other side of it the grapple arcs up really high and arcs past  theres a brief moment where you see it go up and then pass by you heading down towards the wall  is anyone going to do anything  laura i catch i try to catch the rope to try to keep it from hitting the ground  matt you could try  sam /none/ oh boy try  laura ill try  marisha i dont know what to do  laura i did i tried  matt go ahead and roll  marisha is it flying out of our grasp  is that what’s happening  matt it looks like it’s just out of the grasp shes going to try so go ahead and roll a d20  marisha shes going to try and catch it  laura i rolled a 19 i dont know what im adding  matt yeah thats fine so you manage to just catch it holding onto the edge /none/ of the rope  before it clanks onto the ground its just dangling now  travis oh my god  matt you pull it slowly back up  marisha wait  sam you said strength i threw it as hard as i could throw it  marisha quiet shut up  sam thunder  marisha whispers okay maybe if i get over i could hold the other end and help people  laura you can jump ten feet  marisha i think i can  laura oh dear lord what if you fall on the ground beau  travis let /none/ this happen let this happen  marisha look were basically gods okay  laughter  marisha i can make this jump  matt you going to try  marisha

ropes not oh were you holding onto the grapple  taliesin shes got the other end  marisha i was like tracing the rope  matt you grab it affix it easily to one of the smokestacks you find up there  liam she is really cool  matt all right  sam shes amazing /none/  laura great so well tie off the other side yeah  matt ulog takes it and ties the other side of the rope you guys can all begin to shimmy across and  make your way  laura whispers we shimmy  matt so the rope is set up are you guys just going to shimmy across  sam sure  marisha when do we do the cat  sam oh wait do we have to cast do we have to have a distraction  marisha the cat  sam oh were going to shimmy across because what if /none/ the guard looks up and sees us  liam only frumpkin is down at the bottom of the tree he runs around and  sam so we do that now  liam yeah i think  laura well we do that  sam now  laura when we lower into the cellar right when  sam no were going through the roof now i thought no  laura well how  liam wait hold on is there entry through the roof  matt youre not there you cant see it from here  liam we cant see from here  /none/ marisha there is a chimney stack though right  liam a chimney stack were not santa claus  travis we are now  laughter  laura is there a door on the roof how would there be a stupid door on the roof  sam there could be  taliesin sometimes theres balconies  laura theres no balconies  matt theres no balconies on this house  sam look around for a door on the roof  marisha what who would have a door on the roof  sam rich people  matt make an investigation check  marisha i /none/ look around is there a door on the roof  laura maybe like an attic access or something  taliesin french roof  marisha 18  matt 18 you dont find an entry way per se one of the chimneys is wide enough for someone to pass  through it looks like there is a part of the roof that if you were to try and remove some of the  shingles there might be some sort of entrance below it  marisha okay  matt youre on an angle there on each side  marisha it looks like they /none/ need to reroof like they havent done it in about 15 years right  sam sure  marisha so maybe we could get in or go through the cellar or be like santa claus  laura i think we should go in through the roof  sam yeah yeah yeah lets shimmy across make the distraction now  laura we already shimmied  sam no we didnt  marisha its happening now its real time real time i think  liam im sending frumpkin now okay  sam go sausage cat  matt you watch as frumpkin runs past cat /none/ yowling outside of the gate immediately dog  barking hes like no guard stuttering the dog drags him to the opposite side like around  the outside into the fence and is now trying to bite and frumpkins on the other side of the  fence going meows and hisses barking right into the fence the guys still holding back like  shit no stop god stop it is pulling you guys all make it acrossno one seems to notice  none the wiseronto

like a trap door a little bit  marisha oh my god  matt as its pulling up the shingles that are overlapped on it are overlapping the /none/ gap and start  sliding a little bit you immediately feel like if you open this youre going to send a bunch of  shingles sliding off of the roof  liam no get them get them  sam lets go down the chimney at least i can go down there and look to see if its possible  matt there is a very faint trail of smoke coming out of the chimney by the way  laura theres a fire in there what if we pull up these shingles  marisha yeah pull up the shingles  laura and /none/ like stack them  matt so you begin to collect them where are you putting them  sam in the haversack  matt okay so you take a moment to go ahead and carefully you have a collection now of roughly  23 roof shingles in your haversack  marisha those could be valuable  matt so you can add that to your equipment  marisha are they clay shingles very valuable  liam look out giant red dragons  marisha yeah laughs  matt well say it takes you about five minutes or so to finally get all those /none/ off carefully you  manage to pry it open and it opens up ever so slightly and theres a chain on each end that  prevent it from slamming open it opens up just enough that you can slip inside and there is a  small ladder there that you can use to slowly get down into a small attic  laura ill hold it open

crawl /none/ space  marisha well i look real cool for five feet  matt you do its a very small crawl space its maybe like ten foot by five foot its very  dusty in here it looks like there are a few clay pots there looks to be a portrait like some sort  of a large art piece thats leaning against the wall and has some cobwebs over it other than  that it looks fairly empty like it hasnt been used fully you casting detect magic let me  check real fast  yeah so you look around /none/ the vicinity in this chamber and you do not see any  sort of faint magical aura in the crawlspace  sam are there any other doors in this crawl space that lead into the main  matt make an investigation check  sam natural 20  matt you do find there is another trapdoor on the opposite end of the crawl space that is  partially blocked by the art piece thats leaning against it you shift it out of the way and  unhinge the top and it opens and drops down to a hallway that has like /none/ faint a crackling firelight  inside this hallway you glance down inside you can see a long hallway with tapestries on each  wall of a beautiful writing there are two ornamental armor sets that are set up on the side  you can see an ornamental sword that is bolted on the wall on the opposite end and stairs not too  far from where you are that head further down into the building and there is a doorway that leads to  the right on the opposite end of the hallway  marisha jester can you go ahead /none/ and cast a spell  laura what spell  marisha the locatethething spell  laura i am distracted by looking at this beautiful piece of art  sam do you want to draw a mustache on it or something a dick butt  laura i think i studied this artist back at home  liam you know we want to be efficient here quick  laura oh okay it

down and there are two torches that are burning in the edge but they dont have a  fuel source they are an everburning torch and they are both fixed to the wall giving this  flickering light in the vicinity you’ve come down to the hallway  liam yeah  marisha leds yeah  /none/ matt so you guys have made your way down into the hallway you’re still concentrating the spell  right  liam hells yes  matt there are magical auras emulating from these torches theyre both everlight youve seen this  magic before they just continuously burn it’s continual flame you also get a faint magical aura  from each of the suits of armor and a faint magical aura from the sword across the way on the  opposite wall  liam okay  laura like traps or they are just  sam im going to look for traps  /none/ matt go ahead and make an investigation check with advantage  marisha oh fuck  liam do i know the school of magic  sam 20  matt whatd you roll a 20  sam 20  matt 20 you carefully go forward and both you and ulog pay attention the floorboards of this  hallway progress one after another and theres a cluster about four of them about  afootandahalf across each of them that are slightly lifted on one side glancing forward you  can see there’s some sort of pressure device that triggers when those boards are /none/ stepped on  liam theres no magical aura from those at all those are separate youre not saying  matt youre not sure  liam okay  sam ulog you didnt find anything i found a trap  matt actually fine  liam the spell says i know the school of magic for whats on these things you able to tell

about these suits of armor  laura so we wont touch them  /none/ marisha that was him that was him i did not say that  sam lets jump over this little hump  liam okay but i dont know exactly how these work but i have a strong suspicion that these  things can start moving and try to cut us up both these suits of armor and that weapon  laura are those traps would set them off  liam maybe  matt jester as you finish concentrating on the spell and focusing on the wax seal you get a blip of its  location in the next chamber beyond where /none/ you are in the door on the right  laura oh my gosh how great because we came in  sam lets go  laura we have to avoid the traps  sam jump over that little hump  liam hopefully things will go very well but theres a chance that this thing that you are  indicating is not connected to those so be ready to fight  laura so duck down its like the neverending story dont be afraid you guys just go  sam wait what if we are up shits creek so we need schmidts creek /none/ what if you have schmidt do  something can schmidt go do something  matt as this is happening ulog is sighing loudly pulls out some tools and begins to fiddle  with where the boards are on the ground he manages to get a shortsword of his pressed  underneath where the boards are and slips it across slightly lifting each one as he goes until  the sword peeks out the opposite side acting as a platform beneath  marisha dope yeah  sam i told him to do that i sort of  he goes watch and /none/ learn little one  laura its like a training session  matt he goes and carefully steps on the boards and then steps across with no effect  sam is he mansplaining to me  matt roguesplaining technically  liam this is exciting  laura come on this only lasts ten minutes lets go  marisha someone stay watch were going to go this way  sam were making progress you can respond to this message  travis im over here  sam were making progress  laughter  matt as you guys head in theres the

ahead and make a thieves tools check so roll a d20 add your proficiency  modifier and your dexterity modifier should be plus six i think  sam yes 16  matt 16 as you carefully get down to where the knob is you begin to turn it ever so slightly and  you hear this spring begin to tighten and youre familiar with that sound so you manage to get  your tool underneath and you find where the spring is its barely in the space /none/ between where  the door and the edge of the door frame is you get the tool underneath capture it and as you  pull the door open it prevents the spring from pulling back into the device you slowly as you  expose it reach in snap the opposing side and remove the spring entirely leaving the trap  inert  sam these are your tools beau  liam i wish i was still a rogue its the best class  sam i feel so alive  matt as the door opens into a fairly welldecorated master bedroom you /none/ see a large  canopy bed a beautiful detailed embroidered rug that consumes the center of the floor you can see  a fireplace to your right the one that you saw that was attached to the top of the roof that has  a fire burning in it it has two giant statues of lions on each side this cool detailed shelf  there you can see a table with chairs to your left you can see a slight opening to a balcony  thats not visible from the outside  sam ooh an invisible balcony  liam i /dung/ walk up behind nott and scan the room with the spell  matt okay youre just scanning the room  liam im just walking up behind nott no further and looking in to see what glows  matt all right as you glance in and look there is immediately to your left a large metal cabinet  of some kind it is made of dark iron and gives a very faint magical aura to it the rug in the  center of the room gives a faint magical aura as well  sam the rug  laura flying carpet  /none/ taliesin no  laura look for traps in the room  sam okay did you see the lock i just  travis fuckin focus  laura i did but hurry  sam 19  matt youre looking for  sam traps  matt okay investigation check you glance around and look in the chamber you dont see anything  that gives the essence of a trap to you it looks like the trap was part of the entry here but  theres nothing immediately in the vicinity that resembles a triggering trap  liam what kind of magic is emanating /none/ from the carpet what school of magic  matt the carpet its also transmutation and the magic on the large case has a faint abjuration  laura where is the glow for the seal is coming from  matt its underneath the rug  liam i alert everyone the carpet is magical  sam we should not step on it  laura well i need to move it because the seal is under the rug  marisha the seals under the rug  sam do we have anything that can negate the magic or  marisha do you have dispel /none/ magic  liam i do not  sam can schmidt stand on the carpet oh i can move it with my mage hand or something or peel it  back with my mage hand  matt mage hand very helpful when

want me to move the carpet  laura move the rug  marisha can /none/ i do a look for anything that looks out of place any papers anything trap doors  matt investigation check  liam i have a question the carpet reeks of abjuration or i would know that the carpet is magical  sam it was transmutation  liam transmutation if the carpet is magical i wouldnt  matt you can only see magical sources from what you can see so if a things behind a wall or  behind an object you dont see an aura  liam right the carpet seems magical to me i wouldnt think that something under /dung/ the carpet is magical  travis yep i saw it  marisha natural 20  matt natural 20 as theyre having this conversation you glance by the fireplace the  fire is crackling in there and you glance down and right underneath the hearth up where the  fires tickling you see a piece of the stonework that doesnt match the others its slightly  offcolored it looks like the burning of the fire thats been given this dark and blackened look to  it theres one brick there that doesnt seem to have been affected by any of the /none/ soot at all  marisha i avoiding the rug lightly step over it and see if i can jiggy the brick out  matt as your finger presses against the brick it slides in about a half an inch and you hear this  click sound over by where the metal large cabinet is  laura you just unlocked the fucking metal shit  marisha oh shit  liam do i see any change in the abjuration magic when she does that  matt yes  marisha does it go away  matt it vanishes  cheering  sam im /none/ going to cast message we are the fucking best

there is something  laura use the mage hand to move the carpet  marisha give me the papers  sam i cast mage hand and slowly peel back a corner of the carpet  laura i hand the two letters that we made for lord sutan  matt okay /none/ the carpet peels back and it reveals beneath it a section of the wood that has a hinge  bolted to one side of it its a square thats cut out of it it looks like its an open case the  carpet peels back and then begins to fold back in its space and then fold up again it begins to  slightly shift and rise and the carpet almost seems to be gliding in the air on its own in the  vicinity it spins towards you and then rushes in your direction i need everyone to roll /none/ initiative  marisha were fighting a carpet the fuck  laura were fighting a carpet  taliesin we

letters in and the seals lets place it all  matt make /none/ an intelligence check  sam suspense  liam 18  matt 18 while the shape is not familiar to you the size and the length of it youve seen these

you  reprobates breaking and entering the home of a highrichter i believe that carries a life  sentence in the umber dungeon wouldnt you say if i might ask what are you looking for you  have my curiosity piqued theres a brief pause as youre all glancing down ulog holds up the  paper in his hand and he goes you you put my wife in chains and you know shes innocent we  got proof now its over for you she chuckles and scoffs as she falls onto her back leg /none/ and  how do you plan to deliver it curious you think my home wont be swarming with guards in a few  minutes she pulls a brass bell out from under her pouch and rings it outside  laura no i was going to say i cast guiding bolt at her but  matt its such a fast moment if you didnt have anything prepared it happens too quickly youre  like ah and the bell rings you stump sucker ill bleed over the extra years of your sentence  into your wifes that way you can both rot /dung/ together on opposite sides of the dungeon ulog  looks at you all like absolute fury and sadness in his eyes you see like tears down his cheek  laura whispers oh i had it shitballs  taliesin hold person  laura yeah i had it prepared and thats what i wanted to cast fake sobs  matt he goes and takes the paper in his hand and puts it in your arm caleb making eye contact  with you and goes promise me youll see her freed friend  laura i cast hold person on her  matt on /none/ her  laura im just going to do it  travis yeah do it anyway  matt all righty natural 20 she resists it she goes what are you trying and ulog goes  roars grabs towards his neck and runs leaps off the stairs towards her and attempts to tackle her  laura we should take off while he does it  matt you watch yeah he goes and boof she falls onto the ground and onto the landing of the  spiral staircase they both slide a moment you watch as she goes what are you and he /none/ grabs  and pulls that orangeish bead that he had on his necklace and slams it into her mouth and holds it  over theres a moment of tension before  explosion a flash of white fiery burning  light explodes a fireball sundering the interior of the staircase you all have your ears ringing  the pains there the ones that are closest by would have been you caleb i need you to roll a  dexterity saving throw please  sam whispers it was a suicide  liam seven  matt thats a failure  travis oh my /none/ god  matt thankfully a shitty roll for you that is 21 points of fire damage  liam unconscious  matt caleb goes unconscious onto the ground as you guys all come to in the moment you look down  at the middle of the staircase the walls are blackened the staircase is currently in the  process of burning and down you see the twisted gnarled corpses of both ulog and the highrichter prucine  laura gasps we have to get out of here  travis yeah we got to go  matt you hear boom  travis jester /none/ help me we start backing up yeah  laura i run down i grab caleb and we run out the back door  matt as you head down the stairway you can see the front door being hit from the opposite side  marisha what do me and molly see  matt you guys watch this flash of light the glass windows shatter outward from the balcony  the two guards at the bottom go uh they quickly throw open the gate and are now currently  slamming themselves trying to barricade into the door  marisha to the back /none/  taliesin yeah were going to start flanking to the back  matt okay as you guys are rushing make a perception check  travis oh my god  taliesin natural 20  marisha 19  taliesin and laura finally  matt okay as you guys are rushing you suddenly hear this very loud highpitched whine sound  youre like pained sound it causes your head to and you especially glance over as you begin  to surmise the direction you look past and you can see the trispires there in the direction  you see the mighty zauber spire /none/ of the halls of erudition there in the distance and you see there  this growing black spherical mass beginning to emerge from the side of the lower third of the  tower you watch as it expands the whining gets louder and louder  taliesin im going to take cover  matt you hear this crack sound as the black sphere suddenly folds into nothing and where it  was you see all the stone that made that part of the tower collapse crush and then stumble the  tower begins to slowly shift as you hear in the /none/ distance screams echoing around the music stops  the attention of the guards suddenly shift over from the banging door to the tower crumbling you  watch as the tower suddenly theres a flash of blue light and the tower stops you see a brief  shift of a force field on the bottom that holds it in place partially collapsed you see two figures  take off from the top  sam what is going on  marisha what are the figures  matt you see two other figures leap out of the hole from where the explosion weird /town/ black sphere  was at the base of it and leap down about 3540 feet below the tree line you see the two figures  begin coasting flying through the air in the direction where they were as bolts of energy  start arcing out of their hands towards where those two other figures fell the screams are  getting louder now and you can see now the guards are starting to rush out of the various street  corners you guys are rushing around you were rushing towards the back and then slowed as this  started happening its /none/ distracting you you guys start hearing this cacophony outside as you rush  through the back door you get to the back wall what are you doing  marisha theres something bigger going on other than us  taliesin weve got to get out of here  travis calebs unconscious weve got to get him out  marisha i try and  laura i dont have any spells left  travis i have a healing potion ill put it in calebs mouth  marisha i try and get that back door open and try and get them out  matt /none/ you get that door open you guys start rushing out there you heal up caleb you come to  consciousness being dragged your feet grinding  liam i was doing death saves and it was not going well just for shits and giggles  laughter  sam alone upstairs i pick up the scrolls and put them in my pocket  marisha i mean the house is on fire now god damn  sam im going to open the gable windows if they open and jump out them  matt well the windows are shattered the explosion  sam i /town/ jump out the windows and scatter as far as i can  matt make an acrobatics check followed by a stealth check  marisha holy shit  sam ooh acrobatics not great ten stealth 16  matt well you reduce the damage you take by one die so you only take two points of bludgeoning  damage as you land your ankle twists and you tumble and roll and get up whats your stealth  check  sam 16  matt using the chaos that way and the guards that are now out in the middle of the street you /none/ land  behind them one of them goes to turn in your direction and you dart behind the wall leap over  the side and arc around to meet the rest of the party as you all slowly begin to climb over the  back wall where beau and molly are waiting for you  taliesin weve got to get out of here  travis yeah  laura that went so bad  marisha i think we were a bigger distraction  sam whats going on  marisha i think theres something else going  sam did we do this /none/  marisha no we didnt  sam its molly isnt it molly did it  laura we’re running to the sewers  matt running to the sewers everyone make a stealth check as youre trying to make your way  through there people are now starting to run back to their homes you can see people running and  screaming now dressed in full attire for the gala leaving their masks behind screaming bloody murder  travis 15  laura five  marisha 12  liam five  sam 19  taliesin 14  matt okay  liam give it /town/ to me  travis bunch of teens and a five  matt i know thats okay so a couple of bad rolls but for the most part you guys averaged  okay thankfully with the chaos and the way you are dressed you manage to push through and mingle  well it wasnt too hard you make your way through the town you can see the tower still  being held in place and the two figures that you saw gliding before as this is happening and  youre rushing through you see a few other bolts hit a large /none/ bolt of lightning grind down in the  distance before eventually they both begin to peer over and are now looking up and down the  streets as you make your way back towards the alley over by where the gala is you see a  shadowed figure dart out from behind and a bolt of lightning strike theres a detonation of  burned ozone as the figure falls to the ground smoking  marisha i go over to the figure i go over to the figure  matt as you walk over to the figure you see one of /dung/ the flying entities floating down you can see  now this robed mage figure with a staff in hand wearing a large ornamental mantle long grayish  hair is now gliding down in the direction of the dark figure of the ground  sam male or female  matt male  laura steer clear of lightning people  matt yeah you guys see this as you come around  liam age  matt the age roughly from this distance from what you can see its later older age 70s human  if human but you cant quite get the details /none/ it starts shouting one has fallen find the other  and coasts back off doing a pass looking through the various streets  marisha once hes gone can i wait to  matt well the guards have rushed forwards and grabbed the body and are now dragging it back  towards the tower  marisha what does that body look like though  matt make a perception check  travis come on  marisha big money screams in anger fucking shit what is with these fucking rolls 18 sorry  sorry no thats super wrong  matt aw 18  /town/ marisha i saw an 8 and i was adding shit 11 sorry 11  matt all you can see is the cloak the cloak is blocking most of the body you see a hand behind  thats like a leather gauntlet except for fingers exposed the fingers appear to be the glove or  design of it are almost like they were dipped in blue like theres some sort of a blue tipped  glove as its dragged back thats all the details you can make out unfortunately as its being  pulled away off the street the guards are /none/ now swarming people are trying to get back to their  houses people are swarming the gate out of the trispire and the guards are trying to hold them  back calm them down and it’s nearing a riot at this point you guys make your way over to the  edge of the sewers begin to look around for a moment where nobodys watching and one by one  make your way down into the darkness closing it behind you as you all get down into the quiet of  the underground theres a moment where you can hear /none/ the distant muffling of movement footsteps  making their way back and forth across the alleyway other yells and screams information in  the distance far too far away for you to make out the details of whats being said what do you do  travis those men were flying  marisha those men were super powerful  sam we need to get far away from here  laura we need to get back to the other side oh my gosh  marisha who were they targeting  laura they were targeting i dont know  liam not us  /none/ laura are you sure they werent looking for us  liam no i dont think so  taliesin this was something entirely different  liam we need to go find a shitty place and lay low  marisha he was in blue his gauntlets were dipped in blue  laura like the cobalt people  travis lets get back to the leaky tap weve seen the power of the dwendalian empire that was  more than anything ive ever seen weve got to get back  laura ive never seen someone fly before  travis neither have i lightning it /none/ turned him almost into ash lets get back we can talk about  it when were in our rooms safe  laura the highrichters dead you guys that wasnt part of the plan  sam and ulog too i think i was sort of mean to him  taliesin what happened  marisha i tried to get ulog to stay and he didnt listen  travis ulog sacrificed himself he killed himself and the richter  matt caleb at this point you glance down and youre still clutching in your fingers  liam the stone  matt no the paper /none/ that ulog left behind  liam oh  matt are you guys making your way back  travis hell yeah  matt youre heading back through the sewers the direction you came  liam we are walking away  matt okay  laura be aware of the rat balloons  matt barely sneaking away from the insanity of the district you walk through the darkened sewers  down the same familiar path that you walked to make your exit coming up on one of the false  junctions where the left side of it is partially collapsed but the right /dung/ side continues to where  the tsection is beauregard caleb and molly and jester because you guys all have the higher  passive perceptions you begin to notice this area where theres no water that drains down the centre  groove of this part you see spatters of liquid  laura does it look dark  liam what is it  matt well theres no light in here currently  liam ah foomph dancing lights  matt dancing lights open up the area here as you hit the intersection you see it is dark and red  marisha blood  /none/ matt it is spatters of blood and as you glance up right there at the intersection you see a  figure one hand against the wall breathing heavily you glance towards it and take a moment  as the light globes are now shifting out to light the space you see a humanoid figure seemingly  male in outline adorned in jet black almost insectlike leather armour that protrudes in large  sweeping hooks at the joints  the elbow joints the shoulders a helmet thats formfit black  leather and onyx studs wraps around their head it looks demonic /none/ the brow plate sweeping backwards  into rear facing horns their other hand is dangling clutching a cannonballsized  twelvesided dodecahedron shape about that big that has a handle on each side its emitting a  dull undulating grey glow  travis i cast armor of agathys on myself  matt as you cast armor of agathys on yourself the figure which you now see is the source of the  blood looks heavily wounded and is breathing heavily the lights now up its head creaks  turns towards you and you hear a voice say guttural speech does anybody /none/ here speak  undercommon  travis undercommon anyone  liam i cast comprehend languages  matt what are the components of that one  liam that is verbal somatic and material a pinch of soot of salt which i throw out in front of me  matt as you begin to make the incantation the figure pulls their hand away and draws this  horrible gnarlylooking hooked blade from the sheath and goes snarls and rushes in towards  you and thats where were going to pick up next week  yelling  taliesin no  laura everything went to /none/ shit  travis it went perfectly ha  marisha that was a crick  sam whats a crick  liam people from xhorhas  sam i thought that was a story  liam no  marisha
