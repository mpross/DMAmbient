dwendalian empire since forming not but a few months before their  friendship strengthened through victory and through loss theyve decided after a few weeks  of downtime to take on the next route of their journey of all the different avenues that had  come to their attention it was decided to make their way towards the menagerie coast to pursue  some threads that seem to tie into some of the directions that fjord would like to travel as  well as jester /none/ returning to her home you bought some supplies got your wagon prepared and made a  trip south through previous locations that you first made your way up north through going to  alfield and drinking with bryce heading to trostenwald and paying off the rest of the debt  for the previous runner gustav of the carnival which had sparked this whole union of friends  continuing southward past the wuyun gate had a brief encounter with two ettins you managed to  make your way to the menagerie coast itself seeing the gorgeous shores the eastern jungles  /none/ the waves in the distance and on the way actually purchased some pets as well from a  traveling merchant caravan  laura it was a totally smart idea  marisha what have we done  travis ridiculous theyre going to be dead in a day  laura best idea ever  sam best  travis oh jesus  laura what did he write  marisha why would you do this  laura gasps and you did that with blood on your hands terrible  taliesin this will work out way better than that tamagotchi you owned  matt mighty /none/ nein as you close the final miles to the outskirts of the northern side of nicodranas  the first and one of the major port towns in the menagerie coast what would you like to do  laura what do you guys want to see what do you want to do when were here  marisha were here what is there to do  liam ja what is there to see  marisha whats the main points of historical interest  laura i dont know a lot but theres the lavish chateau  sam the lavish chateau  marisha is /tavern/ that where your mom works  laura yeah  marisha yeah i want to see that  sam thats a tourist spot  laura well its a really nice its an inn you know and my mom performs there its really nice  taliesin well that sounds nice  travis this area is known for its entertainment i mean everybodys seen the ocean before right  marisha no  taliesin well actually  sam no  liam no i have never seen the ocean  travis wait one two three never seen the water  sam not interested really no /none/  travis you should its amazing  marisha i want to see that  travis have you not either four  marisha no ive been landlocked my whole life man you guys are the only two  travis wow i feel like were about to improve all of your general experiences of the world  laura its really its the opposite of fire caleb  liam what do you what  laura its really cool  travis maybe we drive towards the coast and then you know take the pch down to nicodranas what do  you think  laura /none/ sure  taliesin big sur is nice this time of year  travis yeah carmelbytheseas a peach  laura i should probably keep myself disguised while were here though just in case  marisha oh yeah why exactly arent you allowed back home  sam shes told us  laura yeah i pissed off that guy and he said he would kill me  marisha oh thats right to kill you thats right  liam does that mean that he would hire people to kill you or he would personally kill you  laura no he didnt seem like the /town/ type that would really do a lot of killing himself you know  liam but is wealthy and connected  laura yes and theres a lot of people you can talk to here if you want to get somebody killed  heres the town to do it  travis jester caduceus looks awful confused maybe you could fill him in again about why your  laura fjord you dont remember do you  travis no i do im looking out for our tall cow friend  taliesin i heard the whole story between games i dont really you should just /none/ know  travis no i know whats happening im just trying to you know schedule a tea break  laura yeah no i pissed off this guy he was there to see my mom the traveler was teaching me  different spells at the time you know i had just started learning about them so i sort of made  myself look like my mother  sam and he tried to get with you  laura well i sort of lured him out onto the balcony  sam oh thats right and embarrassed him in the nude  laura yeah /none/ he was just stuck out there thats all  liam you locked him out  laura yeah  marisha i mean without pants right  laura yeah  marisha thats really funny yeah  travis would you remember his name  laura yeah  sam what is it  laura lord sharp  sam lord sharp  marisha wow is that a chosen name is he an edgelord sharp  laura no he was super not sharp  marisha oh hes a dumb dumb  laura oh you were talking about the mind  marisha yeah sure  travis did /none/ he just visit all the time or is he well known in nicodranas for business or shady dealings  laura i dont know i didnt even know he was a lord  travis oh you just found out afterwards  marisha so this was a random hit he was a random hit job for your traveler shenanigans  laura everybody was a hit job with everybody nobody made it out clean from that place  liam what about besides your mothers place of employment do you know are there other things to see  laura well all over the opal /none/ archways is this really pretty its a great marketplace and  stuff lots of shops i didnt see too much from my window you could see all the houses it looked  like a quilt it was beautiful with the roofs and you could see the ocean so i know the wharfs are  around there you know  travis yep indeed  liam okay  sam well should we go to some of your favorite places first  marisha can we see the ocean  laura you want to see my room  liam you want to go straight /town/ there  laura well we can go to the ocean first  travis the road down is treacherous the benefit of being on the coast is that you limit your field  of danger right its only going to come from one direction thats just something to keep in mind  taliesin thats a very fair point  laura fjord but what about all the sea monsters  marisha yeah you definitely have sea creatures that haunt your dreams  travis yeah no not true actually i have never seen  laura giant sea monsters  travis nope  marisha /none/ you coughed up salt water and you werent even near the ocean that feels like the  oceans real dangerous to me  travis that could be a pituitary thing i have never seen a sea creature in my life  laura theres so many i saw a giant tentacle come out of the water one time  liam right on the coast you saw that  laura yeah  marisha a tentacle came out of the water  laura i saw it from my window it was a really really really big tentacle  travis did you really  /none/ laura of course i did  travis do i believe her  matt make an insight check  travis ooh thats not terrible oh it is terrible 14  laura i really really really saw a tentacle  travis oh shit okay  laura a really big one  marisha how close do we have to be to the ocean while we walk alongside it  travis oh i mean as close as you want to be if you want to put your feet in its an amazing experience  taliesin i definitely want to do that that sounds great /none/  travis its colder than you might think  taliesin i dont have any expectations so im not sure if thats true or not  travis from where we are now would i have any idea how far from the gates that we just have we  passed through the gates  matt you havent made it to the gates of the city yet youre probably about 20 or so minutes from  reaching the exterior of nicodranas if you were to head straight south as opposed to continuing  on the somewhat southwestern path towards the city you would /none/ eventually hit the shoreline on  the eastern side of the city for about 40 45 minutes or so to get there  travis well were so close we might as well stop in  laura stop by the ocean  travis yeah well or your moms place whatever you want to do first  marisha so is there a location to go to the ocean  travis yeah i forget you havent seen it so if you look in one direction and you look  immediately to your left and then immediately to your right all that shit is /dung/ ocean  marisha fuck  travis all of it and as far as you see that line  marisha yeah  travis the horizon thats all ocean too  marisha thats crazy  travis it is  laura its really big its like a lake only a lot bigger  marisha ive seen big lakes but you can always see the other side  laura yeah imagine not  liam well sometimes okay point stands  laura and the water is not that greenish dark color its really beautiful and light blue  marisha see i like these literal examples /none/ because ive only read flowery poetry that makes  it talk about  laura once we get up over this next hill youll see the ocean  sam lets go  marisha okay lets go  matt so heading southward deviating from the path that leads directly into nicodranas the  mighty nein makes their way southward towards the shoreline the better part of an hour passes you  can see to the right the exterior walls of the city and beyond the somewhat light gray to white  patterned walls they may have been gray at one point but /none/ the white pattern you can see across  them seems to be layers and layers and years and years of seagull excrement having gathered  stronger towards the southern side of the wall as you pass near that section of the city  laura i cast disguise self  matt okay what do you look like  laura basically me only human  matt okay human jester  laura all the same only yeah  travis blue skin gone  laura blue skins gone horns are gone no tail  marisha that cute little bob  laura cute little bob /none/ but its black hair instead  marisha so cute you look like catherine zetajones in chicago  travis super tan skin  laura yeah  marisha i love it  matt okay great continuing on this way you begin to see the seagulls now new birds for a lot  of you here you can see these white cawing going overhead as they begin to cluster and hit  the shoreline you see a few of them diving towards the water as you begin to look past the  edge of the rock into the sand bank you can see /none/ eventually as your cart begins to make its way  towards the rougher bit of terrain before it breaks at the ocean the actual waves now crashing  up against the shore and now pulling away pushing again  sam its horrifying  laura what  sam its everywhere  marisha it is everywhere  sam its coming to get us its literally coming to get us  laura no it stays right there it goes in and  sam it comes towards us every 15 seconds or so  marisha its so blue  travis those are seagulls they /none/ are some dickheads if you leave food out theyll snake  that shit in a second  marisha they make horrible noises  sam will they  travis oh yeah and they drop shit on you from above so keep your eye out  laura most birds do that fjord  travis these ones in particular are pricks  marisha i join caduceus in the water  matt okay yeah looking past the afternoon sun at this vantage point especially you can see it  dancing across the distant horizon shore like hundreds of little glistening flecks of glass the /none/  shores sound itself is very soothing as you approach and pull up your pants and take off your  boots to begin to step into the soft sand you can see large rocks that occasionally break up the  beach itself that jut outward and on these you can see small carvings you can see things that  have been drawn on them with chalk it looks like that have been mostly washed away or eroded with  time as close as maybe 150 feet out you see a small fishing ship that is on the outskirts of the /none/  southern portion of the city glancing off to the right to where the city docks begin you can see  dozens of ships that are in the middle of the harbor that are coming into the harbor many that  are in the process of being anchored and then set up within the docks themselves this eastern side  you recognize as the restless wharf of the city and you know the harbor is broken into two  different sides  taliesin im going to take a moment to look through the sand and rocks and see if theres /none/  anything interesting  matt make an investigation check  taliesin 15 investigation wait hold on investigation never mind thats a six  matt you find a lot of really soft sand you start putting it into piles and then you start  building a cool little mound and a wave comes and destroys it and youre a little sad but thats  how life works  travis oh the lessons  taliesin makes sense  marisha can i go out to the rocks and see how far i can hop along the rocks  matt okay yeah theres the /none/  laura do you know how to swim beau  marisha yeah  matt the rocks are pretty disparate amongst the shore here there is one section where you can see  a string of four rocks at different heights that eventually get to about 30 or so feet out into the  shore before they disappear beneath the ocean surface so before you even touch the water you  dive on up to one of the rocks and as you get to the top your hands hit there and you can already  see the top of the rock /none/ is bleached white with seagull shit but its dry glancing over the  side you make a leap to the next one make an athletics check  liam is there easy access to the water here  matt yeah you can just walk right into it its an open beach right here  marisha 25  matt 25 you deftly leap from rock to rock until eventually you get to the final one its maybe  breaking about three or four feet out of the water and youre perched on it and looking out in the  distance you can /none/ see the rolling waves coming in you can see just like that yeah its a  beautiful sight the sun maybe has a few more hours before it begins to become full dusk and the  colors begin to shift in the sky but for you having never seen the ocean for many of you its  serene its different its beautiful its warm and caduceus as you put your feet into the water  it is quite cool it isnt freezing its a comfortable temperate temperature you feel the  sand grip and slowly dissipate between your toes as /none/ you pull it in its a really unique sensation  and you cant help but be excited by it  taliesin youre right this is spectacular  travis right pretty nice soak it up man  marisha beau is going to perch on the rock and for the first time ever willingly meditate while  just focusing on the blue that she is now surrounded by  matt okay  liam caleb has just been staring for a while and is standing next to nott he takes off every  stitch of clothing and everything except for one thing and /none/ hands it to nott and walks in  matt you watch as caleb  laura calebs naked  liam yes  matt caleb slowly submerges entirely into the ocean  liam im just going to walk out into it  matt up to the neck or fully submerged  liam he would keep going and eventually start floating on my back  matt eventually you see caleb vanish beneath the ocean theres a brief moment of worry as a few  seconds pass with no sight before you see bloop buoyantly finding his way to the surface  travis see /none/ nott easy as pie  sam mmhmm  laura we can still see your weenie i can see it  travis i think his ears are underwater  sam im going to nicely fold his clothes and put it on a nearby log or something then ill pull up  my cloak of elvenkind and put out a couple of pieces of meat because fjord told me that  seagulls come for food ill hide and have my crossbow loaded and ready to go  travis im not stopping her  matt as you crouch down you notice the clothing /none/ you place as caleb begins to shift moving slowly  to one side  sam are you trying to prank caleb i will not stand for that well ill go fetch it pick it up  matt you pull it up and you see beneath it a large sand crab that emerges from underneath it  looks up at you with two small black beads for eyes and the claws snapping  sam im going to try to grab it  matt make a dexterity check  laura oh god  marisha yes yes  sam ooh not good dexterity /none/ check 11  matt 11 it rolled exactly an 11 on its dexterity so you manage to just capture it its  going to attempt to snipe at you thats a 17 to hit with the armor class  sam it hits  matt your thumb clamps down and theres an immediate flash of pain through your body  laura hes bleeding so much theres so much blood  matt as youre trying to shake it off its still whipping back and forth holding on tightly  sam im going to go down on it with my knee jump up /none/ and knee down on it  matt okay make an acrobatics check  sam ooh not good ten  matt ten thankfully it rolled lower than you it takes you a little bit of effort it takes you  two or three leaps because it keeps skittering out of the way and youre not about to be bested  by a small crustacean for the third try you manage to get just enough leverage as you push  into the air and with one resounding crack down through its external shell it releases its grip  somewhat on your thumb /none/ you have to actually pry it off it seems to be locked into its death grip  sam you fought bravely hmm more bait ill break a bunch of the crab and put it out and go  back to my perch  matt okay and over the next ten minutes or so you watch as one seagull comes down eats and  grabs it whooshing about 25 of them suddenly descend as word gets out and youre surrounded by  white birds well say for the sake of narrative you manage to pick off about eight of them before /none/  they end up scattering away from it you have this beach riddled with dead seagulls with crossbow  bolts out of their bodies  sam ill retrieve the crossbow bolts and thats it  laura you just leave them dead  sam no im going to take the bodies too  liam i have a question right now where is the lavorregard menagerie  laura what  liam where is the owl the weasel  matt in the cart i believe  laura oh no i have nugget with me weasels little sprinkle  liam owl too owls with /town/ you  marisha yeah owls by the cart  liam i need constant updates to where these animals are  laura sprinkle is here  liam thats the weasel  laura yes like on a doughnut  marisha we did some training on the road  laura yeah i want to play fetch with nugget here at the beach  matt if you guys are doing some training what are you training him in  laura i want to train nugget to blink back to us  sam on a command  matt its going to take you a couple /none/ hours of working with him here on the beach but you can do  that make an animal handling check  laura oh god im so scared  travis say goodbye to that king charles spaniel  laura 17  matt okay utilizing bits of the feed and the snacks that you had purchased off of the original  vendor with sprinkle tucked up in your neck and theyre focused on their various endeavors  jesters tunnel vision focused on this adorable little blink dog the fur is a light tan color  with bits of faintly darker brown stripes /none/ and a hint of calico elements to its coat but very  faint along the back oversized puppy paws that look soft and goofy but the limbs themselves are a  little unnaturally angular for a natural dog you can see some of its fey nature peeking through in  its features its ears are very tall and pointed though wide at the base as you start teaching it  to blink you watch as it prepares each time and as it begins to figure out the commands and what  youre trying to guide the eyes begin to go /dung/ from a dark black to a bright blue right before it  blinks over here and the eyes fade from blue to black as soon as it manages to find its next  location over the next two hours or so of you working with this you begin to eventually develop  the early stages of finding ways to command it to teleport when you want it to although you cant  really guide where its going to teleport yet but youve learned a command or a whistle of your  choice that will tell it to blink  travis /none/ so happy  laura yeah this is so wonderful  travis cant wait for this to go wrong  matt so you get to decide on that  liam if she has ten gold pieces worth of incense she can bring it back to nope  matt did you name your owl  marisha i did  matt what did you name your owl  marisha this is professor thaddeus  travis well yeah sure  laura he looks like a professor  marisha exactly  taliesin he looks like a thaddeus  marisha i couldnt decide if he looked /none/ more like a professor or more like a thaddeus and then i realized  taliesin why not a both  marisha exactly  matt do you meditate for the full two hours that shes training the blink dog or do you return to  professor thaddeus in the cart  marisha no beau could not meditate for two hours no i meditate for ten minutes tops then i  go back and i want to train professor thaddeus to come when i look regal and hold out my arm  matt okay so you stand about 50 yards from the /none/ cart and hold aloft your forearm and attempt to  find a way to coax professor thaddeus  marisha professor  matt roll an animal handling check  marisha professor come  sam offer it tenure  marisha exactly oh thats pretty good 21 i rolled a natural 18 21  matt okay 21 over the next hour and a half or so you realize that your owl wont just come to you  you begin to find coaxing it with pieces of meat that you scavenge from the remnants of the meal  marisha can i have a gull /none/  sam have a whole seagull  marisha thank you  matt youre waving the seagull it seems a bit large but eventually in smaller pieces you begin  to realize you can coax it and you can get it to come to you when you have a piece of food in your grasp  marisha hes so moody  liam mr owl how many handling checks does it take  laura oh wow  travis and taliesin a one a two a three  marisha owls are dicks  matt yeah youve begun the process of forming a bond /none/ with your animal  taliesin im going to take a minute to try and explain to the professor what a doctorate is  marisha okay  taliesin if hes confused  marisha no i just nod and hope that thaddeus is listening  matt thaddeus seems to already have a stronger bond with caduceus than you  marisha stop talking to my owl  taliesin all right  matt while this chaos is happening with caduceus slowly wading through the shoreline caleb floating  in the distance practically nude nott diminishing the population of the various  waterfowl and those /none/ two training their pets what are you doing fjord  travis nott are you sure you dont want to come in im sure jester would hold your hand or something  sam that sounds lovely but i think ill just watch from the shore  travis okay ill walk up to the shore and put my boots in ankles deep in the water and stand  there then ill summon the falchion next to my side  matt as the falchion emerges from whatever pocket space it resides when not in use theres a splash  of ocean water across /none/ the ground flung from the very faint bit of force that is released upon its  summoning as you hold it in your grasp and hold it before you looking at it for a moment the  sunlight gleaming off the blade showing the intricacies of its curvature of the falchion  summers dance mutation that has come from the consuming of the blade not long ago it feels  cold same temperature of the ocean that youre currently sitting in and as the temperature of  the ocean warms to your touch so does the temperature of the blade /none/ youre holding  travis hmm how far out is caleb in the water  matt id say hes about 15 feet out not too far  travis can i use misty step to appear right next to him in the water and scare the shit out of him  matt yes you may caleb as youve been lying there looking up into the beautiful blue sky with  faint tufts of white drifting by but mostly this unending sphere of blue color before you fjord  just appears a shadow above you looming in the water  liam scheisse coughing /none/  travis whoa hey all right there chief okay all right youre good sorry  liam you cant just sneak up on a person  travis sorry i just figured you want some company its really tranquil isnt it  liam groaning oh its very quite nice  travis yeah you seem very at home in the water im surprised  liam i tuck down four feet  travis caleb  liam well no i am just submerging my bits  travis i mean i must commend you a lot of people are very trepidatious in the face of a /none/  force of nature like this  liam no its expansive it just keeps going forever  travis it suits you very well  liam why did you leave it  travis oh i didnt leave it intentionally i tried to make my way back up north to see if i  could learn more about the sword and everything but ive always loved the water yeah  liam so it feels good to be back ja  travis it does yeah i would live right on the water if i could yeah  liam so maybe you stay this /none/ time  travis yeah i take care of what i need to take care of i think a calm life on the water would  suit me just fine  matt as a unique visual perspective here too as caleb is no longer just floating buoyant but who  has probably not had too much experience swimming in the past is having to haphazardly thrash  liam 15 feet out  travis those sandbars are unpredictable man they drop right the fuck off  marisha 15 feet out is far  matt its closer to 20 well say enough to /none/ the point where you can submerge and touch your feet  underneath but to stay above the water youre talking as you thrash fjord is gently buoyant occasionally  putting the hands in the water the armor itself keeping you mostly aloft by its enchantment and  just being comfortable in the water its fjord looming over as youre keeping up with him best  you can  laura its like us when we went scuba diving  liam i take a moment and scan the beach and call out nott the brave live up to your name and jump /none/  in the ocean  laura there is no comma there is no comma  marisha is that it yeah yeah yeah  sam its so big  laura there is a comma there is a comma i know what im talking about get in there  liam who cares go swimming  sam give me a minute i just ate some seagull i need to wait a half hour  travis thats an old wives tale its not true  sam i think its true im cramping im cramping already it could be the crab that bit me  /none/ travis what is it with nott and the water do you have any idea  liam i dont know she doesnt like to swim i dont think but youd imagine seeing something  like this would give perspective  taliesin oh yeah im going in forget this  matt as you guys are having this discussion you watch as this beacon of pink hair emerges from the  water next to you  taliesin this smells weird i really like it  liam is this one of those sea monsters they were talking about  travis it might be yeah /none/ i think that might have been the tentacle that jester saw from  liam you have not seen the ocean  taliesin never before  liam its pretty nice isnt it  taliesin its amazing  travis youre actually in for this is a treat the sunsets are gorgeous here  taliesin oh man i cant even imagine  liam should we stay here for the night  laura no  marisha can we camp on the beach  laura dont you want to see my mom though  taliesin i think we can camp on the beach before we /town/ leave town but if people are anxious to get  this done  laura i mean i can go see my mom alone if you guys want to  travis no were going with you yeah  liam what about tomorrow do you want to go tomorrow does she know youre coming  laura i cast sending  liam what are you doing  laura hey mom  liam who are you talking to  laura im sort of in the wat at the beach right now well not in the water but i was wondering  if youre singing /none/ tonight or if youre singing tomorrow  sam buzzer  matt as you continue talking the voice creeps through and goes jester i only received a  portion of what you were saying but i am singing tonight are you nearby  laura excited gasp my mom is singing tonight you guys  sam oh then we should leave the beach and go to where she is singing  travis agreed  laura she doesnt sing every night you know so if we miss it we might miss it for a while  sam is this a headlining prime time /none/ night or does she get the off nights and matinées  laura no its a special occurrence when she performs  sam oh really were very fortunate then  taliesin it also occurs to me this is an eastern ocean isnt it so it would be a sunrise or a  sunset for this ocean  matt this side of the coast it would be because where you are on the ocean it would be  setting in the west  sam which we have more than one sun though right theres multiple suns in the sky  matt you /none/ have multiple moons  liam get the map wheres the map  taliesin we need an orrery now to figure this out im very excited  matt from the menagerie coast the sun does set in the ocean  marisha okay okay okay west coast  travis well we should definitely go see jesters mom  taliesin without a doubt  travis listen the ocean will be here and weve got plenty of time to come back and fish all  sorts of stuff  sam oh good we can come back then later thats great  travis i know /town/ i can feel the disappointment  sam because i didnt make it in today  travis yeah i know but hey the anticipation keeps building right and then payoff  travis itll be that much more special  sam maybe we can buy some new swimwear while were in town  laura oh yeah  sam or any swimwear  laura because i think your bandages might come off in the water  travis well get you some floaties  laura oh yeah  sam they will help me  travis yep theyll sink you like a stone  laura /dung/ you know nott you also have that fabulous ring you could just walk out onto the ocean  sam i know but i dont know how that works on moving water  laura maybe you should find out  liam seems like it could be potentially hilarious  sam if we want to get a good seat though i feel like we should leave now i need to be up front  because i cant see over people  laura that is true  sam so we should probably get going  travis fair enough it is getting dark lets /none/ dry off get our clothes back on and get moving  matt as you guys gather your things dusk has set in and now the sky shifts from light blue to a  deep blue and purple on the eastern side as the oranges reds yellows and pinks begin to  overtake the western side of the skyline  taliesin thats really beautiful thats amazing does it do this every night wow  marisha yeah i feel a little robbed its just gray and rainy where im from all the time  laura guess you should have come here sooner /none/  marisha yeah  travis but you get amazing storms right thunder lightning  marisha yeah it snows a lot  travis it gets foggy here sometimes  marisha ah we have fog  travis oh well  liam the closest thing ive experienced to this is inside jesters backpack in the dodecahedron  laura oh i thought you meant the abyss of my backpack  taliesin thats exactly what i thought too  liam there was a lot of baked goods in there yeah now its just  laura are you high are you high on the ocean  /town/ travis thats just the jellyfish sting taking effect  liam no its a good day  laura how long of a drive is it of a cart ride is it to the  matt are you heading back to the main road to one of the entrances to the eastern gate of the  city or are you heading towards the coastline to the actual wharf itself  laura whatever way is faster  matt probably the wharf  laura lets do the wharf  matt okay you head along the coastline eventually finding your way to where the wall /none/  itself slowly diminishes in steps it does extend out into the ocean there is no direct path where  you can walk along the shore and go into the city it is specifically marked off there is an archway  there that is gated by two of the guards that run the city  laura i cast disguise self before we get up there  matt okay you do see about six zolezzo that are currently guarding that entrance the rest of you  see armored guards varying from the scalemail and the maroons and muted colors of the /none/ townsguard  youre used to seeing in the empire here the zolezzo have a blue and green base but you can  see on the armor each individual zolezzo has their own unique decoration and flair to it some  way of customizing it making it their own as such even within their own ranks there is a sense  of color and individuality and their own armored senses that doesnt mean theyre not still armed  and wondering who the fuck you are as you approach the exterior of the city as your cart begins to  approach four /none/ of the six zolezzo immediately raise their weapons and they begin to approach  halt what is your business in nicodranas  laura we came to see the ruby of the sea perform tonight ha  matt the one at the front you can see beneath his helmet which has these two bits of chainmail  that curl open like curtains on each side of his face he pulls them out of the way and looks  forward towards the rest of the crew there you can see his darker skin and his thick brow its  almost like a /none/ unibrow that sits over sundried lips that are a bit cracked and parched he  glances forward looks over the rest of you and goes the ruby of the sea  laura yeah  matt make a persuasion check  laura ill use the red dice for the ruby 15  matt 15 okay he goes all right and where do you hail from  laura we hail from port damali  matt port damali is from the other side but its fine he goes all right its roundabout and  you are  laura i am fiona fancypants theater /dung/ critic extraordinaire  matt now make a deception check  laura that fell out of my hands it doesnt count oh its the same roll shit seven  matt he looks back to the rest of the zolezzo and they discuss for a moment for themselves and  he says well i apologize but there is no entry after dark on this side of the wharf regardless  if you want to enter you have to enter from the main gates  laura oh no but shes performing soon and were going to miss it if we go all the /none/ way around  matt well then youll have to find some way to make it through the gate he holds his hand out  laura singsong here we go we need some money lets see how much i have i have five gold to put  in his hand  matt you put five gold in his hand  laura thats a lot of gold isnt it i dont know here you go  matt he shakes it in his palm very well let them in to the side they have a portcullis that  is held up by some /none/ sort of chain mechanism that is beyond the wall they step aside and let you in  they usher you through quickly because nobodys supposed to come through this entrance as they  all walk by you can see them all looking each of you up and down taking a mental note of what you  have on you who you are what you look like as well as what they perceive to be inside the cart  a few strange faces at the cluster of creatures around jester and the rather disinterested looking  owl thats clutching the forearm /town/ bracer of beauregard you pass through this archway on the  exterior wall and immediately look before you and you can see the eastern side of the harbor here  what is known as the restless wharf immediately before you you can see a plethora of people that  are walking along this heavy dockside harbor there are a number of warehouses and small huts  and buildings that are built both on the dock and built along the side of where it adjusts from  stone and sand into wood and elements that turn into the docks themselves you /town/ can see tall cranes  made of wood and cord and rope some of them ten feet some of them 2530 feet or so that are in  the process of either loading or offloading various materials from the trade ships that are  making their way into harbor or loading up to leave in the morning you see two or three larger  guild buildings that tend to be the hubs of information for those that are coming from the  docks there are a few dockmasters that are walking around who are in the process of taking  /none/ down information of who it is entering or exiting with their ships making sure that everything is  being handled and you see a number of zolezzo that are also keeping a close eye torches are now  lit as the sky grows darker and theres one thats going through the city and lighting the  actual oil lanterns that hang on these tall thin poles that dot the city that have to be lit at  dusk one thing that does catch your eye is right towards the center of this harbor where the  restless wharf would be /none/ transitioning into what you know as the open quay which is the other half  of this harbor there is a massive lighthouse that sits on this one bit of rock that protrudes where  the docks come to an end and an element of the stone floor continues out before breaking off into  a shelf into the ocean below you can see this beautiful lighthouse you know it as the mothers  lighthouse it catches your attention specifically caduceus because the beautiful  design of this lighthouse while it seems natural and a gradual towerlike point on the /none/ back side  on the northern side the southern side that faces the ocean has a 20foot relief of the upper torso  of a woman that is emerging from the lighthouse looking out over the ocean a beautiful sculpture  with wild hair that tangles and curls around the shoulders and then merges in with the stonework of  this lighthouse but whats unique is the way the lighthouse itself is placed as it rotates as the  light beacon comes across you watch as the eyes of the woman flare up as the light passes that  side /none/ of the tower you recognize the closer you get to this area this large sculpture is that of  the wildmother of melora that is where the mothers lighthouse title comes from  taliesin how long has it been here for  laura as long as ive been alive i dont know  liam that is how long again  laura you dont know how old i am caleb  liam no idea  laura i thought it would have been obvious and i turn around and walk away  taliesin thats beautiful  matt you guys are making your /none/ way through the restless wharf and getting odd looks from the  side of various sailors and dockhands that are curious as to who you are and how you made your  way here are you heading directly to okay that being the case  travis this is all very familiar to me  matt yeah youve spent a bit of time here  sam youve been here before  travis yeah  sam when did you meet each other you and jes  travis well just on our way up into  laura yeah a few weeks ago  /none/ sam you were near each other for a while and didnt know each other  laura well he grew up in a whole different city  travis yeah im from port damali but i had seen her a couple times in the city  laura well only after i left here  liam how far is port damali from here roughly  matt its a little over 400 450 miles from here its quite a distance  marisha its on like the other side of the the lower part of the continent  matt yeah along the menagerie coast port /town/ damali is the westernmost port city which is why its  the largest here its the major hub of trade between all the western bits of civilization  taldorei marquet issylra with the port town nicodranas being the furthest east the two of  those mark the two endpoints the bookends of the menagerie coast there are a few other port towns  in between but theyre smaller by comparison and nicodranas is about half the size of port damali  travis right as were walking through to make it to jesters moms place any familiar faces  catching eyes /none/  matt make a perception check  travis nine  matt nine everyone seems to be going about their business you are drawing some attention from  folks as it is their job there are a few zolezzo that keep an eye as you pass by you see one male  dwarf figure that appears to probably be the wharfmaster who has a number of people talking to  him who watches you pass by and as he does so he scribbles something in a book and then goes about  his business but thats the most you notice you /none/ pass beyond the restless wharf heading  northnorthwest into the city eventually the hustle and bustle of the docks begin to fade the  warehouses begin to slowly diminish their overtaking of the central business area of the  city and you come upon a large 15foot tall stone archway its a gradual arch as opposed to  being straight and then turning over its a slow gradual arch there with a large gem embedded at  its peak at its zenith  laura the opal archway  sam opal archway  matt there are eleven of these throughout the /none/ district  sam one of the opal archways wow  matt these if you were to recount what information of history you know about the city  here the opal archways once marked the goddamn it  laura no you go ill just repeat it  matt there you go they once marked the exterior of the original city i will fucking kill you  never mind you dont get lore i can give and i can take away no the opal archways mark what  were the original boundaries of the city when it was first founded and the /dung/ city has expanded far  beyond that but that now marks the richer most lively district where a lot of the political  elite where a lot of diplomats and the wealthy merchants come to either live andor spend their  money you pass beyond this archway the original occasional set poles that hold the oil lanterns  that give the faint bit of flickering firelight through these dark cobblestone streets give way to  much more vibrant magical baubles that hover about ten feet above the air theyve already been  set and you see them give off a /town/ brighter glow and the colors seem to shift one of them has a  whiter color but then slowly turns to an orange then shifts to a green about ten feet away on the  other side of the street you see another one thats colors are shifting but in a different  pattern so theyre kind of complementing and also contrasting each other at this point too you  begin to see the streets while not as crowded as the wharf people that are here are much better  dressed you see a carriage make its way by to /none/ your right and you see a few folks that appear to  be welldressed nobles of some kind wearing a crushed silktype clothing that is bright blues  and purples and jewelry of all sorts of gems and colors compared to a lot of the drab decor that a  lot of the noble families wear in your experiences up in the empire the cultural mishmash that tends  to build here on the coast over time with so many people coming from so many places it all has  built this mixing pot of styles and ideas and selfexpression /none/ and it immediately is visible in  the people that live here you do notice strangely that there are a few townsguard among  the zolezzo here  sam townsguard  matt crownsguard crownsguard of the empire  sam oh but were not in the empire  matt correct  marisha do they look like theyre working or do they look like theyre  matt they look like theyre keeping an eye out and you two have had the experience here  crownsguard do have a small presence here because nicodranas is the closest to the empire its also  /none/ the crossover point where the two entities the clovis concord that oversees the menagerie coast  and the dwendalian empire make their laws and agreements and all of their essential intent to  not attack undermine or destroy each other takes place so while the laws of the clovis concord are  enforced here technically the crownsguard can enforce imperial law if they were to see anything  that does break imperial law however their presence is much thinner than anywhere else in the  empire and its more of a courtesy given to them by the concord to make /none/ them feel more comfortable  in the city that is closest here thats largely why this city here in nicodranas is considered a  popular escape for those who want to get away its the vegas of the dwendalian empire where  its close enough they can go travel to and still enjoy a bit of comfort and some semblance of home  in places but its still different and alien and unique enough to the point where it feels like a vacation  travis we can tell from their posture that theyre not on leave theyre actually there more /none/  on duty  matt theyre more on duty though youre not sure if its their own duty or if theyve been given  some sort of post specifically by whoevers paying them but it catches the rest of you who arent  familiar with this sight a little offguard and you immediately adjust your posture and get into a  little more of a naturally defensive position knowing that there is now two forces of law  enforcement now looking to the streets of the archways  laura its okay most of the crownsguard here dont really give a /none/ shit when they get stationed  out here theyre like okay okay and they do the fun stuff too  travis its more of a cush posting  marisha do they give these postings to people who are fuckoffs or do they give these postings to  people who are  travis no theyre pretty legit because honestly this is where the bigwigs go so they  want the best right theyre not going to take a bunch of jackoffs with them  marisha got you yeah  sam so theres a lot of people with jewelry around  taliesin /none/ i was just thinking i felt a little underdressed  sam should i steal some for you  laura well heres the thing you can steal stuff if you want nott but the laws are enforced a  little bit stricter here  travis yeah the clovis concord is iron clad its some hefty penalties everything from  stealing to murder puts you away for quite a while and its a hefty fine  sam all right i wont steal or murder then  travis that whole spectrum in between you can fill in everything that happened in your mind /none/ when  i said those two it applies to that shit as well  laura what else is there really between stealing and murder  sam arson  laura oh thats a good one  travis kidnapping  laura oh right  marisha are we talking about things in between  travis yeah in between those two  marisha so what about mail fraud is mail fraud in there or is it lesser than stealing  sam thats the worst thats the worst crime there is  taliesin no one talks to anyone that commits mail fraud  marisha you /none/ are all accomplices i just want to point that out  sam when caleb and i were in the clink there was a guy in there who had committed mail fraud  marisha yeah  sam he was fucked up by every other prisoner in there  travis they dont like them  sam marked for death  travis dont fuck with the postal service  sam no thats sacred  liam we were the only two people in that cell  marisha were you  liam coughing that is correct  marisha still got saltwater from where fjord goosed /town/ you  travis i shouldnt have surprised you man im sorry about that shit  liam ja thats on you buddy  travis sorry youve got to nah im not going to say it  matt in passing further through the opal archways district you begin to hear the music of various  street buskers and performers beginning to take to the roads they have their own lighting  arrangements and you see a small whats the word for it a topped cart a vardo thank you  laura it was right on the tip of my tongue  taliesin /dung/ it was on the tip of mine but thats fair  matt well it would be on yours a vardo tucked into one corner where there is a small group of  about four performers out there doing juggling acts it reminds you of the early days when you  had first come across the carnival in trostenwald most everyone in the street doesnt pay them mind  occasional silver is tossed their way passing that still you go by a building that catches your  attention immediately this gaudy nearly a palace of an estate you see this large /none/ building white  silkdraped dull brass and orangeyellow stone a sandstone base construct of a building you know  this youve passed it before but youre uncertain this is the marquis demesne this is  where the marquis of the city lives  sam marquis demesne  matt even at a glance you can see that theres probably well over 40 rooms within this establishment  laura we get lots of visitors all the time  marisha so its a big house like a mansion  matt it looks like a small compound with three low towers four or five /none/ story towers two at the  front and one towards the back thats the taller of the three all one singular building it looks  like a palace small for a palace but too large for a mansion its that weird inbetween state  a lot of money has gone into its construction and the closer you get to it you can see that maybe  its not in the best of upkeep but what you do notice is that the presence of zolezzo is very  strong theres probably about 20 or more zolezzo that are in the process /town/ of keeping an eye on the  vicinity walking around the boundaries of the exterior of the demesne you can see eight or so  that are stationed at the front and a few that are walking along the upper parapets or high  walls keeping an eye down on the street  laura does it seem like the same amount thats always been there  matt yeah it can vary but you get the sense make a history check actually  laura 13  matt you get the sense that theres probably a handful of diplomats that are staying /tavern/ there as  guests and thats why the guard is a little more heightened than normal  laura whispering theres probably diplomats there tonight  marisha wartime  matt as you curve around the bend of the exterior of demesne you see before you what is considered  the highend inn of the opal archways you see this beautiful threestory thin but very tall  building of soft sky blue pigment thats been painted across the stone and each windowsill you  can see this goldleafed wooden frame that dangling from it is a deep cerulean crushed  velvet curtain /none/ that open up across glass windows that appear to be stained glass and glowing from  the inside emanate this slightly shifting kaleidoscope of color from the inside out the  steps that lead up to the front double doors which are currently open emanate a very soft  sound of music a four five piece band apparently playing gentle atmospheric music to  the interior this is a very familiar sight to you jester as this is the lavish chateau this  is where you grew up this is your home  laura she hasnt started yet you guys /none/  sam i hear music is that the warmup act  laura sure but if you dont hear singing she hasnt gone yet  travis do we have to pay to get in  laura no i never had to  sam well you lived there  laura so yeah its probably free  sam is this a hotel  laura yeah  sam you grew up in a hotel  laura well i mean it wasnt a hotel to me we had a lot of the top floor  liam but under normal circumstances because you look this way /none/ but would everyone know you here  laura you mean like as a human or would they know me as a me  sam as jester do they know you  laura well yeah of course they would  sam but you dont want them to see you so how will we get in  laura well im disguised  sam i know but how will we get in  travis what was your name again fiona fancypants  laura yeah  travis okay just fiona  laura okay  matt you know disguise self lasts an hour right  /none/ laura has it been an hour  matt its been over an hour but ill say that youve kept it up but mark off two more 1stlevel  spell slots for the time its taken to travel since you arrived at the ocean  laura well two more since wait  matt from traveling from the ocean to the city and making your way through its been the better  part of an hour so it would be two spell slots  laura okay okay  matt yeah a little over an hour since you left the beach  laura /none/ i just recast it  sam sure well then how are we going to get in  laura what do you mean how are we going to get in we go in they dont know you they know me  and i dont even look like me  sam im going to disguise self too  travis do they check weapons at the door anything like that  matt from what you recall they request weapons be noted you can keep a weapon on your person  as a means of selfdefense but you cannot come in fully decked out /tavern/ ready for armor you can have  one small personal item on yourself as a means of selfdefense everything else can be kept at a  coat room at the entrance you also do see two zolezzo that are stationed on either side of the  open doorway that is part of the protective presence here at the inn and the higherend  customers that they see  liam before entering i would look for an alleyway in the last few minutes before getting  here to make all of my clothes look i cast disguise self on myself and /none/ dont change my  appearance other than to make my clothes look brand new and slightly more expensive than they are  taliesin i may join you in that if thats all right  liam by all means  taliesin ill also humanize myself and put together something that looks appropriate for the  sort of people ive seen walking around lot of pearlescent whites and greens  matt make an intelligence check  taliesin oh thisll go poorly  travis youre still very tall  taliesin no im not  matt he can adjust his height  taliesin one /none/ foot up and down  laura what  matt thats part of the disguise self ability that he has  laura i thought it was just a thing  matt no its a racial trait of a firbolg  taliesin straight intelligence check 14  matt okay youve taken a bit of time to study the accouterments and fashion of those around you  in the city specifically those that appear to be common denizens of nicodranas as you emerge with  caleb you see caleb in this beautifully clean wellpressed coat with a higher collar a wider  sleeve /none/ and with cuff you can see a bit of a cravat poofing from beneath a very nice presence  and you see with the same pink hair how would you like to be dressed  taliesin definitely the same pink hair but tied back hes a thin adult human man whos got a  little bit of a scruff going into a bit of a shaggy goatee if this is appropriate for it a  little bit of the french restoration but nice pale opalescent whites  marisha i keep imagining lord strider  taliesin oh my god okay yes /none/ thats fair its muted but fun  sam i will also cast disguise self and turn into a female dwarf with a simple muumuu  travis a simple what  sam a muumuu  liam dont insult my dignity just give me the muumuu  matt all right so you almost look like one of the ghosts from pacman  sam a blue muumuu  matt okay perfect  marisha is that blinky i think that was blinky  matt as you approach and begin to step out of the cart you see a young human man in his early /tavern/ 20s  or so his hair gelled back but it tends to curl up and poof a bit towards the base and around the  sides of his neck hes wearing a vest with a plain but wellmade silk white shirt and a pair of  trousers you recognize him as tyral he is essentially the front hand of the inn as he  approaches he looks up to you are you leaving your cart here are you going to be staying  laura yes were going to be staying here  matt all right well i will see that /none/ this is taken care of please enter  marisha do you board animals  matt we can there is a charge  marisha cool heres the pigeon hes been eating  sam seagull  marisha sorry its a seagull  matt um sets it on the railing of the stairway on the side and goes very well i will see and  tend to the horses and your hawk  marisha professor  laura its an owl  matt ow ow ow  travis that sucks  laura what is that for  sam other pets  laura no thats /none/ for money  matt this is actually to pay for the service  marisha here i pay him how much is it  matt he doesnt say how much do you give him  marisha for the service of boarding the animals  matt boarding the animals and taking care of the cart  marisha i give him five gold because i saw jester do that earlier and it seems to be the  common courtesy of nicodranas  matt all right you drop five gold in his hand and his eyes go wide hes like oh of course  /none/ marisha was that a lot of money  matt right this way  laura for this particular thing i think it was  taliesin thats a lot of happiness and thats okay  laura it looks like were really well off though thats good  matt he seems to be immediately swallowing the pain from the talons that are grinding into his  forearm and is now smiling brightly and eager to please the new arrivals on the outskirts  travis theres more where that came from if you take good care of them  taliesin lighten up a bit /none/  sam what about the other animals  laura theyre staying with me im not giving these things up  sam youre walking in with a dog and a weasel  laura well the weasel is tucked in so really no one will notice it but yes im walking in with a dog  sam okay all right  liam yeah its like a lap dog  laura my mom will want to meet him  sam sure okay  travis the dogs going to piss everywhere  laura no blink dogs dont pee  travis oh  laura its /dung/ a rule its canon  sam have you named the weasel yet  laura yeah  matt as shes saying this a dark spot is slowly spreading across  travis yeah you just got peed on beautiful  laura his name is sprinkle  sam sprinkle  laura yeah  sam sprinkle the weasel  matt it is a male  liam sprinkle and nugget and professor thaddeus excellent  taliesin i named the seagull in my head too  liam whats the name  taliesin steven  matt it would be a steven  taliesin steven seagull  marisha /none/ steven seagull thats good  travis oh yes i got to give it up  matt your cart is taken care of one of your animals has found a temporary companion you make  your way up the steps the zolezzo keep an eye out and nod as you pass walking into the interior  the warm light and music embrace you as you step within the lavish chateau the first thing you see  are four chandeliers hanging from the ceiling in different corners of this very tall chamber about  15 or so feet from floor to ceiling /none/ there are rafters that align with a series of wide wooden  bars that hang from the right to left side and the chandeliers that hang from them appear to be  made of a polished silver color and on them hang about 20 or so candles per chandelier that are  giving off this gently flickering warm light that trickles down into the main area you see two  bars one to the right and one to the left in the far corners with each being tended to by one  bartender you see a few servants that are /dung/ jogging from table to table and ten or so tables youre  used to the dark wood taverns and the dives in various degrees all the tables here have fine  very highcount white cotton or a white dupioni silk that is pulled across and around these  circular tables and across them a silver platter that contains candles fresh fruit complimentary  slivers of cheese and crackers that are set out there there arent a lot of people in here  theres maybe nine patrons that are currently in the tavern but those that are in here are very /none/  well dressed theyre clustered around three separate tables three three and three at three  different tables  liam im a heathen what is dupioni silk  matt dupioni silk its a type of silk material that has an interesting texture to it  liam okay  matt ill show you at the break  liam i was just curious  laura its really pretty its basically the nicest kind you can get its really fancy  liam is it like the velour juicy sweatpants that i saw when i first moved here  marisha im going to google /none/ it dipi how do you spell it  taliesin everybody at home gets out their swatch they got  matt it looks a little rougher than just smooth silk it has a bit of a texture to it and it  looks a little more natural  liam legitimately just curious  matt there you go  marisha its shiny its shiny silk  travis you said with those nine people that are in the room how many tables are there about  liam thats dupioni silk i knew that dupioni bob dupioni  matt exactly you see ten tables /none/ in the room total  travis ten tables  matt yes though the clientele can shift based on time as you enter and look around on the far end  there is a single staircase a wide tenfoot staircase that ascends up towards the back wall  and then splits in two different sides into two separate staircases that ascend to the second  level along that you can see all the wood painted in a faint gray or very light tan color  there is a carpeting that is draped over the center about eightfoot wide down the staircase /none/  that is a similar light blue color as the paint on the exterior of the building  laura isnt it pretty  sam its beautiful  laura i used to run up and down these stairs late at night  sam can you remind me so i dont call her mrs ruby

a private show  laura she doesnt do that it would cost a lot of money  sam well maybe it wasnt publicized maybe its a surprise dropin show  laura what  matt as you guys have been standing in the middle of the foyer area youre pushed ahead by another  group of about four individuals they look to be merchants welldressed for the occasion and they  push passed ah excuse me they go and find another /none/ table and you get the sense that the room  probably is going to be filling up  laura we should probably get a table as soon as possible wheres the backstage door where do i  get to my mom  matt your mom actually descends for her performance so youd have to go upstairs  laura i want to go upstairs  matt okay just you  laura yeah  matt all right so you guys all find a table  taliesin

possible  matt okay you guys all find a table you ascend the stairs with the normal route youre used to  taking which is to the right of the stairs split towards the second floor you can see on the brief  landing before it goes up to the second floor there is another zolezzo guard whos stationed  there keeping an eye out he looks to you nods you run up /tavern/ to the secondary floor where there are  a number of various rooms for the inn that are for rent you head up the next flight of stairs as  they both meet in the center theres this second flight that mirrors the bottom floor parallel on  the floor upward that one splits again on the top floor and there as you get to the third and  final floor of the chateau on the left side there are a number of inn doors but there is one  doorway that is made of a different wood grain than /none/ the rest of them it was a gift from a very  interested suitor years ago and it has been installed but it marks the chamber where the ruby  of the sea makes her home and for most of your life until recently you made yours  laura i go up to it  matt okay you go up to the door  sam we stay downstairs right  liam i buy the group a round  taliesin aw  matt you can hear muffled through the doorway a little bit of practiced singing some scales some  la /dung/ la la la la you hear other voices talking and theres some rustling moving through someone  seems to stub a toe and goes ow were trying and theres a few other people rushing  around in there  laura i knock on the door and say good evening marion lavorre the little sapphire has come to  see you  matt theres a pause and the door creaks open you can see one of the servants who works within  the chateau an older woman in her forties human with very short crimped dark hair who generally  helps /none/ prep your mother helps her get dressed and helps get her prepared for the performance  glances past her name is actually let me look it up nadine she peeks through looking at you  im terribly sorry what did you say  laura im here to see the ruby of the sea  matt unfortunately she is going to be performing shortly  laura i know tell her that im here  matt she is not  laura i know tell her tell her shouting the little sapphires here to see you ruby  matt you hear a voice /dung/ from behind her go im sorry what from peeking over her shoulder as  your vision focuses into the chamber beyond low lit beyond the series of candles that are set  around the single mirror you see the beautiful red skin of your mother and the dark hair tumbled  past the shoulder as shes been wearing a mostly laced up bodice as the other servant is in the  process of lacing and tying it glances over her shoulder and pushes past the edge of the chair  laura its me  matt you see her smile brightly /none/ her faintly white glowing hint of yellowishgold tint to her  eyes brighten immediately and goes well come in please close the door  laura excuse me nadine  matt nadine closes the door and goes im very confused by this mistress but whatever you  require at which point the other one whos lacing is still pulling on the back of the bodice  and without even looking at her marion pushes her aside shh  laura i run forward and give her a big hug  matt as you give her a hug she holds you there and /none/ goes you look different  laura whispers its a spell im actually still me dont worry  matt theres a nod and the tension in her body melts as her arms close around your shoulders and  back and pulls you in close this moment of warmth and relief that washes over both of you and being  reunited here in this chamber the two servants sit in the back awkwardly not quite understanding  entirely either and whispering to each other while marion continues to hold you and rock you  back and forth my beautiful jester i have /none/ missed you so much  laura i missed you so much i wanted to come home sooner but we got distracted because  we went to the empire  matt i remember you telling me you telling me you were going to go there  laura oh thats right i sent you messages yeah  matt how was it i have not traveled beyond the boundaries  laura its really cold and the people are pretty strict but theres some really nice people that  you can meet i met a lot of friends you should meet them  matt /none/ id be happy to  laura theyre downstairs  matt she traces her fingers down your face  laura here i put her hand on my horn so she can tell its there  matt she feels it can i see my little girl  laura is it okay with  matt theyre fine you drop the illusion and even though she knew it wasnt until she gets an  opportunity to look upon your face and your hair and your eyes and your smile that you watch life  breathe in like a renewed fire into the chest of /none/ your mother immediately she grabs the sides of  your cheeks and pulls you in ive missed you so much brings you in and kisses you on the  forehead and starts running her fingers through your hair  laura be careful of the weasel his name is sprinkle mama  matt he is very adorable  laura im going to say i left nugget downstairs with you guys  marisha okay  travis after he peed on you  laura yeah  matt she immediately starts brushing your hair with her fingers on the side youve gone so far /town/  and traveled so much you have to tell me about what youve done  laura i will of course do you want me to finish lacing you up your performance is tonight  matt yes it is please do not mind she knows what to do now in front of the mirror with you  behind her shes looking at you through the mirror over her shoulder as youre helping  lace up the back of her bodice  laura we went to a town and it was burned down and we killed a bunch of gnolls and we /none/ took off  their ears then we went to another city and we fought these fish people in this swamp and it was  really crazy oh my gosh you should meet this monk girl that i know shes crazy and she fights  with her fists and also with a staff and shes really strong theres this other girl who has  wings and i tell her all about it  matt shes enthralled listening to all this i would never have thought my little jester  would be seeing the world and fighting creatures  laura fighting so /none/ much you should see how strong ive gotten  matt i want to see how strong youve gotten  laura well i mean okay do you want me to punch you  matt perhaps wait until after the performance ive just applied my anyway at that point she  stands up and nadine helps her put the rest of her dress on its this beautiful deep purple  satintype material its lowcut with this beautiful long training sleeve that hangs down  past her knees when her arms are at her side puts on her necklace a faint velvet choker /none/ that pulls  across the back of the neck there and in the center is a small blue gem that she keeps to  remind herself of you she takes a moment to look in the mirror well how do i look  laura you look beautiful mama  matt then perhaps you should go join your friends  laura oh right i cant disguise myself anymore though can i borrow a cloak or something  matt perhaps you can technically spend higher spell slots to cast a lower level spell  laura shit  matt if you want to /none/ its up to you  laura okay thats all that ill do ill cast it again  matt okay  travis youre going to see a show what could happen  laura all my spell slots okay i run back downstairs  matt okay you run back downstairs join the rest all right  marisha we still have caduceus yeah  laura shes almost ready shes so beautiful  travis thats great was she happy to see

the way i look any glances  looks anybody we recognize anybody lingering on us  matt in the 15 or 20 minutes or so that jesters been gone the rest of the room has filled to the  point where there are a few people hovering around your tables in hopes that perhaps you will leave  and they will try to snipe it from you occasionally clear their throat in your presence  hoping that maybe youll recognize /none/ their status as higher  travis oh yeah were here we are here  marisha i make myself look real big put my staff out  travis feet up on the other chair  marisha yeah holding the chair for jester  travis what move on friend  matt they eventually make their way to the opposite side of the room perpetually throwing  stinkeye in your direction  liam are we in the front or the middle or the back  matt you guys i believe took a table near the stairs which would be on the right side /none/  probably for a table that was available looking from the entrance you came so it would be on the  northeastern side of the building  liam okay how big an audience space is it  matt its ten tables  liam roughly how many people are crammed in here at a guess  marisha ten tables is a lot  matt yeah throughout the interior of this whole chamber you probably have now including  yourselves close to 50 to 60 people  liam okay  matt that includes the people who are standing because the tables have /none/ either been taken some of  the tables here are set in reserve for people that are only two folks that sit there and no one else  is allowed to take the table and it is enforced they come with their own zolezzo bodyguards  marisha are they there the two people  matt yeah there is a couple that is currently situated on one of the central tables  marisha what do they look like  matt the first one you see is a human woman probably in her early twenties or so very vibrant  blonde hair /none/ that is pulled back and left into these curls that spiral down off the shoulders  wearing a lowshoulder dress thats made of a very fine you cant really make out the material but  it has a sheen to it beautiful jewelry across the way you can see a much older man receding  hairline a bit deep grayish turning white hair very deep set crows feet in the sides of his face  where his eyes are almost not visible the eyelids themselves seem to be almost drooping and the  wrinkles beneath are encroaching upon what little /none/ of the eyes you can see probably in his seventies  or so very well dressed with a coat and tails both their attire seems to be more dwendalian than  menagerie coast at least in the styles that they are wearing though they do have two zolezzo that  are hired and keeping a watch at the table  marisha jester you recognize those stuffy pants people  matt you do not  sam good one  marisha thanks  laura no ive never seen them before have you eaten any of this cheese its really good  sam /none/ no but we got you two milks because theres a two drink minimum  laura oh

end liquors or bottles of wine  marisha table service  liam whatever is expected here caleb covers  matt all right that will cost you approximately  marisha one platinum  matt almost six gold for two bottles of wine  sam wow /none/ so generous caleb thank you  matt actually no im sorry i read that wrong for the liquor it would be six gold for the two  bottles of wine its ten gold apiece so 26 gold total  laura i told you i was rich  sam do you tip in the menagerie coast is there tipping  laura do you tip here  sam in the menagerie coast tipping five percent ten percent  matt i dont know do you tip here  travis the whole fucking society is based off of tipping  liam but caleb does /none/ not not know that and does not tip he has no experience with any of it  marisha just like a zemnian  matt the doors are closed on the other side of the chamber the band brings their song to a  close a bit of a murmur takes the quiet room as the lights shift the candles that were all that  warm yellowish orange light suddenly all at once reduce to a low red flicker  sam this is exciting i shouldve peed before the show started  laura i never really get to watch from down /none/ here  sam this is

away  matt the proper way to celebrate  travis singing dd beyond  matt all right as youve all been sitting in your seats enjoying your small table snacks the  chamber has closed the lights have shifted and there is a bit of anticipation and tension in the  room as the musicians begin to slowly build /dung/ up to a new type of song that begins to fill the space  you hear the gentle footfall down the stairs curving down from the right hand side to the  central staircase the beautiful visage of the ruby of the sea in her dark dress the train  dangling up about six or seven steps behind her as her fingers trace the sides of the railing she  comes down takes a breath and begins to gently sing to the audience around you and you watch as  everyone in the room begins to lean forward entranced the /tavern/ beautiful voice filling the  interior of this inn the lights seem to almost flicker and shift with her emotional intent of the  song as her voice fills the space with warmth the light seems to brighten ever so gently with  each crescendo even the bartenders themselves have stopped though theyve seen performances  like this hundreds of times its still a performance that draws attention from all across  the coast and beyond jester youve seen this many times as well but it doesnt ever lose its  luster you see as all the tables themselves are /none/ quiet as she steps into the center of the room  walking from table to table tracing the edges with her fingers making eye contact with each of  the patrons you see that older man and the younger woman sitting at the table both sit  comfortably watching but cant help but smile in the presence of this fantastic vocalist you see  at another table there is a rather burly looking man who is well dressed though a bit rugged for  what hes wearing who is flanked by two dwarven bodyguards and hes leaning in real intent /none/ on the  table towards her and as she steps by he touches her hand and she touches it and pulls away a bit  and gives him a wink and continues singing he pulls back into his chair resting you watch as  one of the other tables has these three merchants that have been there since the moment you arrived  who seem to be eagerly counting out coins and pushing them to the edge of the table to tip her  as she passes by she glances off to one of the assistants who rushes over and /none/ scoops them off the  table she does not accept the tips herself  marisha classy  laughter  matt nevertheless for those of you who this is your first time here within the lavish chateau  this is definitely one of the most beautiful performance youve seen and you immediately see  why jesters mother why the ruby of the sea or at least one of the many reasons that shes  renowned across these lands as she completes the piece she ascends back up the stairs back to her  chambers vanishing from sight as everyone within stands /tavern/ up and begins clapping and cheering  sam brava  laura i see it yeah nice  sam well put it in post  matt with that the doors open to the backside of the inn some folks begin to saunter out their  performance that theyve come to see for the evening complete others go back to their meal  and their drinks and their conversation some individuals begin to approach the bartenders and  eagerly ask for what you know to be the availability for companionship that the ruby has  for the evening  laura good luck /none/  marisha dude jesters mom has got it going on  travis that was really something  sam she was so good  laura isnt she wonderful  sam so much poise  laura turn your fucking thing away from me its hurting my heart  travis you cant even watch aspca commercials  liam so i got to look at it  sam she was amazing  laura i know  sam i mean how much does she make for a performance like that  laura oh i dont know we never counted it  marisha does she only /none/ work on tips or does she also get paid from the venue or is that  laura well i mean she lives here  marisha oh right  laura but she gets paid for other things and the tips from the singing the singing pulls in the  other things you know what i mean  taliesin no  travis it was mesmerizing jester i mean she really had an effect on the room was it just me  or did the lights seem to dance when she was singing  laura thats her thaumaturgy  sam oh  travis /none/ you have that  laura i do i make the lights flare just a little bit  matt you watch as the lights flicker and shift in a similar way that they did with the performance  some of the patrons stop and look towards the stairs to see if shes coming back down again and  then sigh  laura keep your pants on  travis making them want an encore huh  laura are you all in love with her now  sam shes a striking woman  travis stunning  taliesin very impressive  liam would she /none/ sing with you when youre alone  laura well yeah she sang to me all the time  liam did you sing with her  laura sometimes mostly it was just her though  travis do you ever wish you could do what she does  laura be that pretty and graceful and sing really good and have a bunch of people think  shes wonderful  sam yeah  laura no of course not i like myself just the way i am  marisha i think youre pretty and graceful and pretty graceful  laura thanks beau  travis /none/ your singing voice is nice  laura thanks fjord when did you hear me sing  liam when you first told us about your mother  laura oh thats right i did sing for you youre welcome  sam hey look weve made it through a whole show with no frog people attacking us or anything  so thats good  liam the night isnt over yet  sam that happened at the last show we went to  taliesin oh  laura yeah big scary dude  travis oh thats right man that was our first  sam show /none/ first show  travis did you want to spend more time with your mother did you  liam i would assume so yeah  laura well of course usually after the performance is taken by other things  matt the heavy footfalls catch your ear as this stomping sound start making their way down the  stairs you watch as a male figure comes down in a huff one of the men that you saw watching the  performance earlier the more muscular fellow getting a better look at him now you can see he  has a rough tangled /tavern/ like a bowl cut that is a bit unkempt at the shoulders a very wide neck  and once again hes well dressed but his sunweathered skin and lack of social grace and  his physicality belies this weird space between how he holds himself and how he dresses  nevertheless he storms down the stairs his two dwarven bodyguards leaving along with him they  end up exiting the inn  travis he didnt look very happy  taliesin no he did not  laura singsong he probably got turned away because my mom was already taken  sam /town/ how does she figure out whos going to be the customer is it a lottery or a wait list system  laura its kind of a wait list but usually she only has you know a few patrons during any given  period of time so shell have the best diplomats that come to town and if theyve claimed that time  then they can spend time with her for an entire week or even more and nobody else will come to see  her you know what i mean  travis does she have to deal with a lot /none/ of jealous suitors  laura sometimes theres a lot of people that want to marry her and have tried to court her and  stuff like that but she only ever you know said yes to my dad  sam aw  travis shes got lots of security obviously this place seems you know pretty well  laura yeah theres lot of security guards around here unfortunately  sam well should we leave her in peace if she has work to do we should leave  liam is there a time of the day or the week that you would /none/ have motherdaughter time  laura it would usually you know shed come tuck me into bed late at night afterwards  sometimes i would already be asleep but shed come in and say im just saying good night to  you love then she would go and then wed wake up and sometimes wed have breakfast but  sometimes we wouldnt and then sometimes she was gone for a few days at a time because the people  here they dont really want to know about their daughters or anything like that so i would stay  hidden she would /none/ tell me to and then sometimes shed be free and then we could have lunch or  something  sam sounds fine sounds normal  travis i think wed all like to meet her would tomorrow be the time for that  laura i can send a message or tell you what im not going to waste a spell slot im just  going to run upstairs and tell nadine to not disturb my mom but to ask if its okay if i come  by tomorrow maybe  matt as nadine opens the room actually your mother and opens /none/ the door and your mom who has  taken the dress off and has currently put on a comfortable robe turns and goes jester i have  taken no suitors this evening so we can spend it together  laura what really  matt youve said you wanted me to meet your friends i want to hear their stories and i need  to say thank you to those whove kept my little girl safe  laura mama thats so wonderful ill be right back can they come upstairs  matt of course of course  laura do you know

we supposed to follow okay we follow  matt you guys head all upstairs and eventually /none/ make your way to the third landing and the  chambers open and there nadines waiting and escorts you in beautiful chambers with a large  canopy bed you can see silks in the windows that have elements of gems and beads knitted into these  braided cords that you can imagine during the daylight would add bits of colored speckles  throughout the chamber you see a balcony that overlooks the entirety of the wharf below and also  know this to be the balcony where jester got in trouble but there you can see within this  travis /dung/ marquis demesne  matt exactly  liam its marquiz  travis marquez  marisha marquayee  matt im very confused by that exchange but chairs are being brought up more food is being  brought up behind you two more bottles of wine have been fetched to your chamber and there robe  placed on most of the jewelry removed but still fully made up and smiling as you enter you see  the beautiful redskinned ruby of the sea her dark hair now tied up behind and resting down the  back of her robe with a single curl /none/ that runs in front of the face on the right side  faintly white yellow gold eyes the horns that curl backwards and then shift off to the sides  abruptly before curving back a little bit its this beautiful curl that extenuates the way her  hair falls behind it gives this wreath and a crowned look to her this regal presentation even  when shes just wearing comfortable robes as you all enter one by one she goes please know that  you are guests of me here within this call this your home for as long as /none/ youd like to stay  laura we could stay here forever if we wanted to  sam i dont think thats what she means  matt well you would have to eventually

of her mother as well she puts her hand out  travis ill give it a kiss  matt she pulls away but rests just a moment on your finger tips before pulling away and smiles  i can see you are a very strongwilled and protective man do you watch over jester  in my stead  travis i do i try to  matt good i feel better knowing that shes safe in your care anyway  laura this is beau /dung/ shes really

good  laura this is nott shes very very brave even though shes very small be careful of your rings  sam i wouldnt steal from your mother and if i did we would solve the crime  laura thats right

the two bottles that were brought up as  opposed to the smooth wine bottle this has a faceted gemtype crystal design to it the cork  itself has a deep crimson ribbon thats tied around it theres a little wax seal placed upon it  laura oh hold on let me go get the aerator  sam oh whats that  matt its a cantrip  laughter  matt aerating sound you begin to tell her tales of the adventures youve had and recount how  youve met and /none/ you talk for a number of hours or so shes smiling and listening and engaging  while shes this beautiful matronly woman there are moments when you can see that warmth and pride  creep through when she looks at jester you can also see that there is a very reserved and  controlled wisdom and intelligence to her shes a very perceptive woman that asks the right  questions at the right moments to throw you offguard a bit and also get a bit of honesty  you begin to see how the quality of her companionship comes from /none/ her insightfulness and  ability to bring comfort to any conversation though you had all these expectations and you  have your guard built up you cant help but strangely feel welcome and open with a person that  youve just met you take a moment to think on that and see this is really an incredible woman  but youve all said so much about yourselves i am afraid there has not been too much happening  here that is different performances are great there is two new songs that i have requested  written that should be completed /none/ by the end of the year  laura gasps i cant wait to hear them  matt i cant wait to perform them for you  laura what happened with lord sharp did he cause too much of a stink  matt not with me he knows better than to go after a wellconnected and mostly innocent figure  i have been working to try and get those charges eliminated but it is a difficult process he is a  man who his pride is very important to him so in time but for now perhaps just do more of /dung/ what  youve been doing to not look like yourself once you leave this space  laura yeah  sam hypothetically if he were to pass away would the trial charges disappear with him  matt laughs i mean yes but i would not insinuate such a dark thing  sam no no  travis nott remember what we talked about criminal penalties  sam thats murder  travis yeah thats one a1 bingo  sam thats on scale all right  laura we do really good things most of the time though  matt well what has brought you /none/ here i mean im happy to have you but if you are just here to  see me perform then i  laura we should show her the letter  sam oh yes were solving a mystery  laura yeah like remember we told you we were detectives  matt right  sam were also here for some other fjord things but he has the letter were trying to figure  out the provenance of this thats a detective word of this letter and who wrote it and who  is it for and stuff whats that  travis indeed /none/ would you mind if i asked your mom a few  laura oh not at all go for it  travis just because youre so wellestablished in this region so wellknown and connected as you  mentioned does the name marius lepual ring any bells  matt not directly but i may be able to ask around  travis well if it wouldnt be too much of an inconvenience  matt i would perhaps she hands it back to you  sam does that letter say evantica on it also  laura yeah it says evantica  sam does that /none/ name mean anything to you  matt unfortunately no i have not come across an evantica  sam how about the captain  matt there are many captains here in the port i apologize but i know many  travis ionos is another name mentioned in the letter  marisha ionos is the time of year no  travis no its many thanks to you i think its an i  marisha oh yeah  matt i dont know an ionos either you do recall that ionos is a member of the jagentoth  family up in shadycreek run  /none/ marisha and sam thats right  matt yeah that was the connection with who that letter was intended towards  marisha to the iron shepherds right okay  sam another dead end  laura well figure it out  matt but continue to ask this is a vibrant city and there are many people that come and go  perhaps you could find somebody to help you out there i will continue to ask around im  being careful with my socialization these days  travis please we dont want to get you in any sort of trouble  matt /none/ well its no trouble i just  laura socialization why mama  matt ive been having some problems with a client  laura what are you talking about  matt its fine hes a very intense man who relocated here from fionen about two months ago  a burly fellow named algar dyomin  taliesin funny hair  matt yes kind of strange interesting taste in presentation  laura was he the guy that was here tonight  marisha yeah kind of buff  matt that is him yes he is very  liam what was that last name again /dung/  matt dyomin dyomin sighs hes become very possessive he has been a client of  mine a number of times and while his conversation was on the duller scale of individuals ive been  with he paid well and did not seem to bring a problem but he has become more and more  possessive and only in this past week ive been hearing of him threatening and telling other clients  of mine to back away i do not enjoy people threatening my clientele or my business i have  twice now explained to him precisely the nature /none/ of our arrangement and relationship that does not  seem to be enough for him now the zolezzo of the chateau are my guardians and theyre very good  about keeping watch i have my friends in the archways but the more i look into it i believe  algar works directly for the concord within the city so he is with his own powerful allies as well  sam the concord  marisha travis and liam the clovis concord  matt this is my first time dealing with scenarios like this but id prefer to avoid any  sort /none/ of direct confrontation by any means necessary any bloodshed within the chateau sighs  laura we lure him outside of the chateau and then we kill him  matt laughs  laura i dont want him to hurt you mom  sam if youre trying to break up with him you could tell him that you have the creepies the  crawlies down there and that might scare him away  matt i appreciate your cleverness little nott however rumors travel quickly  sam oh that would ruin you for the other clients too  matt for some of them /none/ perhaps  sam smart  liam you are unable to speak to the law here  matt he has not broken the law his friends in some places enforce the law that is where  my conundrum lies  marisha what exactly does he do for the clovis conclave concord  matt honestly im not certain what kind of work he does though he often brags about his  importance as men are wont to do he does seem rather wealthy and he bears enough respect  perhaps the wharfmaster may know more  laura maybe we can get him /none/ to fall in love with someone else  matt that would be helpful though i dont mean to brag but good luck  marisha we could just kick his ass intimidate the shit out of him tell him hes not to fuck  with you anymore  laura yeah but that links it back to her  matt be careful how you dance around that  travis oh sure discretion is appreciated  matt very much the old woman of the lighthouse has been here for some time could ask her perhaps  travis the who  sam and marisha /none/ the old woman in the lighthouse  matt yes  sam someone lives up there  matt yes the keeper of it the lightkeeper  taliesin does she have a name  matt gladys i think  travis i dont mean to pry into your business too much but are your appointments exclusively here  or have you ventured to his place  matt no they only meet here it needs to be on my terms it needs to be in my realm of safety  travis understood do you know where we might be able to find him does /none/ he say where he stays  matt no hes also been braggadocious but not forthcoming with personal information either  which is unfortunately a sign of perhaps dubious andor dangerous business hes told me  twice he wishes to one day show me his secret his great servant beneath the city but  marisha what  laura his great servant beneath the city  travis sirens understood im sure with a personality as large as his it wont be too hard  to find some information on him some gentle poking around  liam just speaking hypothetically it would not /none/ upset you any if he were to disappear  marisha accidentally  liam not be around  matt i dont believe hes done anything that would warrant anything too disastrous but if he can be  ensured that his presence is not welcome and agrees that is the case that would be optimal  liam well we will try our best to reach the optimum result  marisha do you know if theres a place where the lowlifes of the city like to congregate the underground  matt there are many there is the skew which is where most of /none/ the riffraff and common folk live  but if youre looking for more social environs all across the restless wharf there is the open quay  those two places a lot of curious folk wander and celebrate fisticuff it is not uncommon  to find bodies in alleys  marisha i love celebrating fisticuffs  travis that you do  laura what was his last name  liam dyomin  marisha algard right  matt dyomin algar algar  travis jester i have to say i dont feel any great rush to continue on out of the city until  /none/ you at least feel that your mother is safe and protected  laura really you guys will stay here  matt please i do not mean to impose my responsib  laura mama theyre going to take care of you  marisha yeah i mean you did take care of us in those early days even if you didnt know it  jester picked up the bill a lot  laura thats why i ran out of money thank you for sending that package by the way  matt of course im sorry it took a little longer than anticipated /none/  laura no no no its fine  taliesin you mentioned the lighthouse would we need anything to enter the lighthouse some token  of familiarity or some name that would get us a tour to meet the proper people there  matt as far as i know there is but one person there i have not met them directly only heard of them  taliesin gale  sam and matt gladys  matt shes the lightkeeper of the lighthouse i know that she can be rather ornery so perhaps you  need to win over her interest  taliesin /none/ all right  matt she is a bit older in human years so be respectful i guess  liam what are these interests you are referring to her interests you said to our friend mr clay here  matt i dont know i dont know what her interests are but perhaps if you could find out  or at least not make her extremely angry  liam well it is good that we have the worlds two best detectives with us that should be an  easy task to fulfill  sam us  taliesin oh thats right  sam /none/ you havent seen us solve a crime yet but  laura we do a really good job  taliesin sure  travis jester looks extremely motivated perhaps we taking care of this simple errand for you might  help compensate for a few nights stay  matt i do not require compensation but if it makes you feel better about it certainly youre  quite the gentleman  marisha hes actually not the gentleman we met a guy who goes by the name gentleman  laura have you heard of him mama  marisha oh shes like oh okay got /dung/ it i dont know who knows who  laura hes blue as well and hes always sweaty dark hair  sam hes wet  laura yeah hes always really wet  sam hes a wet walker  marisha a wet walker  matt yes i know of him  sam you know of the gentleman is that a good thing or a bad thing because were not  cool with him so much  matt well i know of a man of you describe of blueish skin and quite sweaty yes he has come  through before  laura was /dung/ he nice or was he not nice  matt he was very nice he was very dashing  laura yeah  matt i told you about him before  sam and marisha what  laura wait a minute but not the gentleman though  matt i dont know of the name the gentleman but  laura he has dark hair hes got black hair thats really long  marisha and blue skin  taliesin oh my god your mother knows the gentleman thats so cool  sam it goes a little deeper than that deucy is that  marisha whats /tavern/ happening  sam thats why you always have a little sweat right there  laura no  marisha this is why you can do watery stuff right like cold stuff can you do that  matt tell me more of this gentleman please  laura oh my gosh okay well he lives in zadash and he lives in a bar and hes got long black  hair and hes really charming but kind of snarky at the same time  matt well dressed smooth voice little patch of dark hair on the chest right there  marisha the leaky nip /none/  travis leaky tap  marisha leaky tap not the leaky nip  laura he wasnt in the leaky tap  matt thats a very different place  marisha i have it in the other book  sam the evening nip  laura no no  sam thats the gentleman the evening nip  matt yes the evening nip is the name of that one  marisha okay were fighting over taverns  travis oh my god were freaking out keep it together  laura we have a gift for him or something we have many gifts or something  /tavern/ marisha we have nothing to offer but we can provide many gifts  sam he has a barkeep man named clive binz he knows a guy around here too named father pierce  matt i dont know about anything in that regard but he wasnt named the gentleman when i met him  travis what was he named  laura i never asked  sam i have a vial of his spit can you analyze it i dont know  matt she smirks a bit and says oh honey  laura he did wear lots of rings on his fingers /none/  matt we had a bit of a romance years ago  sam how many years ago by the way  matt i told you about babenon  sam marisha and laura babenon  matt babenon dosal  laura i didnt ask if that was his name though  sam your dads name is bob  laughter  matt bab  marisha wait bob bobanon  matt babenon  liam bob loblaw  matt bob loblaws law blog  sam i have no idea what his name is  laura babenon babenon dosal  marisha wait babenon what  sam /none/ bob babylon  matt you say hes in zadash now  laura but you said he lived in the ocean  matt thats what he told me  laura oh my god what if the gentleman is my dad  taliesin wait what  liam are we saying if or are we saying is  laura well we dont know for sure  liam your mother might know for sure  laura do you have a picture of him do you have a drawing of him  sam why dont you draw the gentleman youve probably got drawings of him /none/ in your book  laura ive got a drawing of the gentleman in my sketchbook  taliesin this is the perfect time for a game of pictionary im so excited both of you dont look  sam yeah you draw one and she draws one  marisha and then compare  travis draw off  liam id like to think the party is legitimately this excited  marisha oh hell yeah we are  taliesin i dont understand whats happening  marisha this is the best episode of maury ever  matt marion seems both present and not shes trying /none/ to process all of this she reaches over  and goes to her counter and begins drawing shes not anywhere as good an artist as her daughter  laura well this is pure gold whats happening here  taliesin it is amazing whats happening over here oh yeah  marisha im glad that an offhand joke about the gentleman led to this  liam that is the cartoon character daria  travis those are some huge sweat drops  marisha wait let me see  laura it looks like daria  sam daria with a beard  laura jesters a /none/ really good drawer even though im not  taliesin yep theres no getting around it  laura imagine this is like davinci  marisha its very scott pilgrim have you seen this woman  sam are you drawing matt right now  matt well yeah if youre going to draw a picture im going to draw one real fast too  marisha matts a really good drawer  matt not at this speed im not no im not shes not a good artist either so shes like  sam thats so much better  laura that is him  marisha /none/ lets see lets see  taliesin does it look like the same person when we look at the two drawings  matt you can make a connection  taliesin okay  marisha so is it the same person we need to know that  travis jester that is quite the revelation your dad i mean babenon is tracking us  laura he has our blood  matt i am so confused by this but youve talked to him youve seen him you know where he is  laura yeah hes in zadash do you want to go see him  /none/ matt i cant leave  laura oh my gosh oh my gosh im going to send him a message okay and then we can see if its

god do you know the ruby of the sea oh my god  marisha hes going to think hes being wiretapped  matt okay so /none/ the spell sends no response  sam maybe you should say this is jester  laura no hes gotten my messages before he knows its me  liam that message probably interrupted a threesome  laura ive seen him having sex and stuff we havent seen it but we know  travis probably doesnt bother your mom  laura but i wanted him to be true to her forever im going to try one more time  sam oh gosh  laura what do i have is it nighttime already  matt its late evening its probably close to midnight /none/ by now  laura okay im going to think about what im going to say on this one im using my pearl of  power its my last 3rdlevel spell okay hello gentleman this is jester please respond just  yes if youve seen the ruby please is that 20 oh oh shit balls  laughter  matt oh my god  travis please tell me it plays with those exact pauses  matt of course it does  liam i want to hear some 1988 phone voicemail message thrown on top of that  matt there is a palpable /none/ pause of nothing and then he responds no thats preposterous  laura thats preposterous he says  matt maybe it is  marisha did the guy that you know use words like preposterous  matt i know a lot of people use the word preposterous its a fairly standard word  marisha is it i dont it feels okay preposterous  matt im sorry maybe i just got a bit excited my apologies  laura i didnt even think to ask about him in zadash because i thought he would be in the ocean  liam in the ocean  /none/ laura yeah he told mama he was in the ocean  matt said he had to leave and take care of some business on the sea i never saw him again  sam just like a man  matt youre not wrong but though he may be gone he left me with the greatest gift ive ever  had so she runs her hands through your hair once more for that im thankful  marisha do you still love him  matt love is a funny thing theres still a part of my heart that will always be his but /none/ its been  decades you move on  laura decades holy shit  matt that could mean literally two decades  travis youre 60  sam do you not know how old you are  laura of course i know how old i am im just questioning my moms math is all  sam decades could be 20 years  marisha or 30  liam im 50 50 years old i kick  laura i stretch  matt regardless you can see shes flushed in her face  sam weve gone through a lot tonight so maybe well leave you /tavern/ to your peace you need to process  some things and then in the morning well go notmurder this guy  liam definitely not definitely nott  sam yes i see what you did there  taliesin i dont is there a thing oh well  matt i will have rooms arranged i will send the servants to get it taken care of you will have  the finest suites at the inn for the better part of this week and longer if need be just let me  know you can see shes a bit shaken by everything but /none/ trying to put on the facade that  shes good anyway it is a pleasure thank you for the companionship for the words for the  stories and for bringing me my little sapphire i should probably sleep good night  travis thank you  matt thank you thank you if you need anything to be shown taught i have friends  who can help you  taliesin i dont understand what that  sam its a freebie you can have sex with someone  matt well  laura not a freebie  taliesin thats fine lets go ahead  /none/ liam oh i was going to ask if she could recommend any bookstores but i was mistaken about  what the topic was  taliesin no you might not have been i dont know  liam can you recommend any bookstores here in the city  matt i dont really go out to the bookstores i have books brought to me but you may look around  there are a handful im certain  marisha okay lets go  travis yeah lets call it a night thank you  matt good night and she pours her glass full holds it /none/ and sleep well and she kisses you on  the forehead  laura goodnight mama  matt good night jester closes the door  liam caleb for all of this for the last hour has been trying to figure out if she seems okay  so in this moment does she seem okay  matt i dont think she seems okay  liam but you know what i mean even prior to finding out that news i mean seeing her mother  im saying for the entire evening here even before that  matt well thatd be more of a /none/ question for her  liam yeah but im not asking im just wondering  travis how do you feel  laura well kind of stupid for not thinking to ask the gentleman when we met him but  liam ask him what  sam he didnt ask you  marisha hey crime boss are you my dad  laura i did think it was fun that we were meeting somebody else who was blue  taliesin theres a lot of blue people in the world  laura are there  taliesin i assume  liam youre also not constantly perspiring /none/ or anything  taliesin only just now  laura thats true  travis did you want to have a drink and think about it or go for a walk  sam or a swim  laura why would i need a swim  sam i dont know because youre half water person  laura oh  liam nott are you going to go swimming with her  sam if she wanted me to i could  laura really  sam i would do that for you  travis what about a night swim  laura its actually pretty dangerous to /none/ go through the skews at night  sam yeah thats what i thought can i see if your fingers are webbed or anything  laura theyre not webbed what if hes my dad you guys  sam well then youve had nothing but positive interactions with him right what did we do with  him did we do anything weird  travis weve done very right by him but weve also tipped him off to the fact that you assume  that he might know your mother at a more intimate level  laura is that bad that i put /none/ that out there  marisha i guess it depends on if hes trying to hide it or not  travis would be nice to see his face when you ask the question you know what i mean  taliesin this is the sort of conversation one should have in person i suppose  liam its a question mark right now but there will be another chapter to that story  laura ill just send him messages every day  taliesin and travis well  sam i dont know if thats a good idea  liam why dont you give him /none/ a few days to ruminate on what you have just said and see if  anything returns or maybe we will return its your decision  laura its going to be so long before we go back to zadash maybe  liam at the very least i think you should sleep on it  laura okay  travis should we turn in for the night then  laura i guess so its pretty late  liam i bet youll go right to sleep ja  laura yeah sure  marisha what stories did your mom tell you about your dad /none/  laura just that he was very charming and that he wore lots of rings on his fingers and that you know  travis he came from the sea  laura well that he lived on an island in the sea and they were going to get married he said  he wanted to and he went to prepare his house and never came back she thought maybe something bad  happened to him  taliesin perhaps hes hiding which is why he couldnt answer that question  laura but she said he was very charming and very sweet and /tavern/ very funny he always made her laugh  liam its good that you got to see your mother though you seem very happy to see her  laura i am shes really wonderful isnt she  taliesin oh yeah  travis yeah  laura we should go to sleep  sam all right  matt your rooms are arranged for you theyre pillow trovelevel presentation the interior is  warm and the beds are ostentatious  travis four poster gaudyass  matt yeah from what you guys are used to sleeping in you almost dont know what to do with /none/  it once you lie in bed its almost too comfortable  liam are they all kings  matt roughly yeah queen to king you all managed to find yourself some rest for the  evening some more tense than others some setting up invisible threads the morning comes with the  light of the sunrise you open your windows and look out over the ocean and the city below you  can smell the salty air the marine layer has brought in a familiar gray sky to those of you who  grew up to the more northern regions /town/ of wildemount you can still hear the distant calls  and caws of the flying seagulls and ocean birds you can see some of the higher buildings and  towers with their little perched clusters you watch as a few dive down into the merchant  districts of the city and some distant echoing yells as they shoot back up with a caught fish  that was supposed to be sold the ships are already out and starting their day you can see  maybe 20 or so that are out in the main harbor and scattering further to find /none/ their specific areas to  begin throwing their nets into the water the morning is yours  travis howd you sleep jester  laura great i slept really good  travis you know i was thinking one thing that might help take your mind off this is making sure  your mom stays safe right take some solid steps to making sure that galdar  all algar  sam algar dyomin  laura that he stops  travis yeah  sam lets go find him  laura okay  sam i have an idea  laura okay whats your idea /none/  sam if you go on a date with him fall in love with him get pregnant then hell want to settle  down and make you an honest woman and hell never go back to your mom again  laura thats perfect but then i might have to stay with him i dont want to do that  travis there is actually a lot to do this morning i feel like we should send some to check  out the lighthouse maybe talk to the wharfmaster and maybe send someone to  marisha maybe go to this open quay /none/  travis yeah just some lax scouting you know  taliesin ill head to the lighthouse  sam were trying to find him where he lives who he works for  travis anything i think  taliesin survey the territory  liam you should probably be speaking to the people on the docks yeah  travis yeah i would like to find the wharfmaster  laura i wonder where the concord yeah where theyre based isnt there a headquarters  matt actually the palacelike center here  laura the marquis  matt the marquis is the head of the local /none/ chapter of the concord that looks over nicodranas the  concord itself is a loose union between all the cities in the menagerie coast theres a margrave  in each city that is the head of the city but then works with the other margraves to interface and  make sure everythings good bad and business is well that would be the center of concord  influence here  laura okay  travis weve managed to enter relatively quietly i think if we can maintain a certain level of  anonymity we can acquire some decent knowledge meet back here /none/ in a little while and share  marisha do you want to do two groups  travis i suppose we could lighthouse and the wharfmaster  marisha all right  taliesin works for me  marisha maybe we can all meet up at the quay afterwards  travis ooh i like it  marisha the open quay  taliesin thats a great idea  travis midday  sam midday at the quay  marisha midday at the quay  sam what do you say  marisha i say okay  sam the wharfmaster is going to tell us what now /none/  laura yeah why are we talking to the wharfmaster  travis i would like to talk to the wharfmaster  sam oh you want to go talk to the wharfmaster great  travis plus it would be a good chance to ask around about algar hes influential in the city  liam in zemnian its pronounced key you said quay  marisha i dont know  sam what is a quay  laura im so confused lets go  sam okay  travis whos going to the lighthouse  sam people who can talk they said that shes ornery /none/  travis okay you three nott do you want to come to the wharfmaster so you can take a swim  sam ill go to the lighthouse  taliesin also on the water  marisha ill go with you  travis yeah guns out  sam what about you jessie  laura im going to the lighthouse i said  travis four to the lighthouse two to the wharfmaster i like it  matt okay heading to the wharfmaster is fjord and beau  marisha biceps and triceps  travis before we get there i pull beau aside all right /none/ so this is my turf  marisha yeah  travis there may be some familiar faces we came in before and i didnt change the way i looked i  wanted to see if maybe that caused a rustle im going to change the way i look now  marisha okay you didnt notice anything before when you came in as is  travis yeah  marisha do people not like you here  travis i dont know i want to ask about my old crew and my captain son of a bitch betrayed us  and all that i /none/ dont want people to know that im alive when i was back in port damali and i went  looking through stuff my mere presence there when none of the rest crew was was enough to get looks  its what drove me out so i think ill be able to discover more if  marisha if youre not  travis  me yeah  marisha deal am i your servant your bodyguard am i your yesman i can be your yesman  liam hype man  travis sure yeah  marisha copy that  travis yep ill use mask /none/ of many faces to make myself look like a very tanned human with jet  black hair pulled back into a tight ponytail in the back with a black goatee maybe slightly overweight  laughter  travis had some better days in the 80s  matt all right steven so you  liam russian accent vague  travis my name is sheagal  matt okay  travis sean connery voice steven seagal  liam you cannot mix those two impressions together its too dangerous  sean connery voice i suddennly remembered my charlemagne normal voice doesnt work  matt doesnt /tavern/ work the two of you make your way back to the restless wharf youre searching for  the wharfmaster specifically make an investigation check  travis oh god yes i know what that modifier is no  matt and since beaus helping you you can do advantage on that one  travis thank you that was the same roll both times that was really shit eight  matt okay beau have you retrieved the professor or have you left it with the inn  marisha hes staying at the inn  matt okay you spend the better part of two /town/ hours or so wandering up and down the wharf asking  questions before you eventually have somebody point you over if you looking for the  wharfmaster hes at the wharf load right there and points over one of the larger center parts of  the dock that jettisons out into the harbor a good hundred or so feet there is a central dock house  that is one of the buildings you saw when you first entered where you saw a lot of the business  was bustling around although it is not as busy as it was at /none/ dusk when you first entered the city  marisha of course the wharfmaster is at the wharf load we probably should have checked  there first why didnt we do that  travis yeah i dont know  matt but as you approach the building you open the front door and someone is pushing past you  there are a handful of zolezzo looking around but it looks like entering the wharf load isnt a  notably guarded experience so as you enter there is one zolezzo across the way that is sitting in a  chair and looking out /none/ and chewing on some sort of rough tobaccolike leaf in their jaw across the  way you can see a couple of folks humans in the process of filing out big leather books  ledgers and receipt books of various people traveling through and you see in the back over a  table with a bunch of papers rolled out either charting maps or large assembled lists of previous  excursions you see a male dwarf probably middle to older age red hair that tends to eventually  expire into a deep gray at the end of this really curly /none/ matted beard you see big gold thick  earrings that hoop from each earlobe the weight of this heavy thick lobe has dragged the ears to  stretch a bit past the face the hairline comes in a deep widows peak that recedes almost back to  the top of the head before coming in and there you can see in a similar tangled tuft the rest  of his hair that coasts past his shoulders before it exerts into a strange puff he is wearing a  simple leather tunic over a work uniform but three or four fairly /none/ expensive necklaces or  amulets that clatter around as he moves you get the sense of his placement by the other  individuals going up and asking him questions hes probably the wharfmaster  travis ill make my way up to him if hes not busy  matt he looks busy and there is a counter that prevents you from traveling in without going  around it as you begin to make your way around the counter one of the individuals up  there puts his hand out whoa whoa whoa can i help you  travis raspy older voice /none/ yes im so sorry i was wondering if i might be able to speak with the  wharfmaster and ill produce two gold coins and start to rub them together  matt ill see what i can do he takes the coins and pockets them and walks behind and begins  whispering the dwarf puts his hand up for a second and finishes making a couple measurements  and then huh all right he jumps off his small stool and comes over with heavy footsteps across  the wooden creaking floor now extending over the wharf he approaches the edge /town/ of the counter  across from you and goes right so youve summoned me to you what can i do to help you  travis im sorry were quite new in town unfortunately my companion and i we are from  port damali where we are trying to put down our business roots here im sorry does vandren and  his crew do they make shipments here regularly its one of my return clients  matt make a deception check  travis 26 off of a natural 19  matt did you have advantage on that  travis oh why /town/ did i roll advantage on that  matt what was your first roll  travis 20 why did i do that sorry  matt i dont know just double checking he looks at you and goes hold on a second  you see his gears turning and he goes through a couple books unfortunately by the records  records we have here vandren and his ship was lost at sea months ago  travis you dont say  matt i apologize  travis thats quite unfortunate ive been given a task here in town algar does he do a lot /none/ of  business here on the wharf  matt yes he comes and goes rather commonly yes  travis i happen to have crossed paths with him one night while drinking i guess we made quite  the impression on him and we are to deliver some items to his place of residence however my  friend here was shitfaced and we forgot to ask where he lives i was hoping perhaps if you  could give us a point in the right direction  matt i honestly dont know where he lives but i know where he works  /none/ travis oh yes then that would be most helpful  matt all right he works in the sluice weave  travis the sluice weave not loose leaf sluice weave  matt the sluice weave sluice sluice weave  marisha i definitely wrote down sloose sweef  matt sloose sweef there you go  travis oh fantastic that helps us immensely do you know of anyone else looking for a merchant  perhaps on the cheaper side services  marisha we sell things  travis yes rare things and very boring things at times  matt if you are looking to /none/ sell you are welcome to go to either meandering treasures here in the  restless wharf they tend to pay maybe not top change but quickly as far as dezima does  his business usually  travis dezima  matt dezima he is the proprietor of the meandering treasures  travis wonderful this has been most helpful well i thank you for your time are there any  available docks for rent or for lease if we happen to come upon some vessels or ships  matt we have and he looks back to one of his sheets of paper /tavern/ and pulls it out for a second and  looks at it we currently have eight dock spaces not spoken for that are available for rent if  that is your interest depending on the size of the vessel of course  marisha seems like a lot of dock spaces have a lot of openings business been slow  matt no weve just had a lot of ships leave recently there is a lot of movement in and out  marisha oh sure just curious  travis one other thing we heard a gentleman over at the bar speaking and /none/ someone called out to  him marius lepual does that ring how do you say that name  matt make a persuasion check  travis how were we saying the last name  liam les paul  travis 15  matt hes like ive seen him around hes a dubious sort of prick  travis yes very gregarious personality from what we could see what does he do exactly  matt fuck if i know to be honest he takes up space hes done some work at the docks here and  there but he rubs me the wrong way /none/ probably find him drinking at any of the dives  travis that is where we should look  matt if not drowned already  travis ah yes we did notice actually last night there seemed to be an influx of strange  characters coming in last night did you happen to see anything around this area  matt there were some strange cats that came in last night off the docks yes  travis anything in particular that caught your eye  matt he starts giving you a curious look youre asking a lot of questions for a person ive /none/ just met  travis im sorry im so new here i was just hoping to acclimate myself and perhaps  matt of course let me give you a very prestigious piece of advice i think that will  help you in your business dealings here dont ask so many questions  travis ah yes perhaps its time we take our leave  marisha grunts  travis thank you  marisha sorry salt water air is not coughs used to it  matt good day then he turns back and clomps back over to his table and is working but keeps /none/  looking up expectantly waiting for you to leave and kind of like  travis maybe we do like the three backward steps and then the turn and then both walk out  marisha that went well right that was really great right i was fucking awesome  travis yeah you were great  marisha thank you i was just following your lead man you know just nodding  travis yeah that came out of nowhere you got a lot better at that okay so i dont know where  do we start well i guess we meet back up /none/ with the others  marisha and he said that guy hangs out at the dives  travis i know  marisha so like two birds one stone  travis smash all right lets get him  matt so what are you guys doing  travis were going to head to what time is it ish  marisha yeah it is midday  matt at this point in time id say its probably a little past noon since the morning  travis oh shit fuck  marisha its midday  travis yeah we should go meet with the others  marisha /none/ yeah we go to the open quay  matt okay so you guys heading there to meet with the rest of the crew right the rest of you folks you  matt make your way to the mothers lighthouse during the day here and as you approach there  are a few fishermen that come up there are a number of small wooden plates that are weathered  and dried and cracked in places theyve been left out for a long time theyll walk up and place dried  meat fish theyve caught sometimes somewhat ripened and some rotting fruit /none/ that have been  placed there these appear to be offerings as a subtle worship to the wildmother you are  familiar with some of these practices though not quite as crass usually in presentation but  it seems to work for travelers that wish for safe exit from port  laura its really pretty  taliesin its beautiful  laura we should go inside  sam were going to go inside and talk to gladys yeah  laura i wonder if it looks like you can still tell that theres boobs from the inside  liam maybe its built /dung/ into the architecture of the rooms within  laura snickering maybe you can sleep in one of the boobs lets go  liam only one way to find out yeah  taliesin ill find the door  matt you walk over to the door it is a standard thick dark wooden door with a small  slot to look through that is currently closed  laura knocking  matt you wait about a minute and theres no response  laura knocking louder  matt the louder one seems to echo a bit and after another minute or so of waiting /dung/ you hear  this faint creaking sound  laura its haunted  sam its a robot  matt it gets louder and louder until eventually the small door opens and you see this really  shriveled womans face these beady little dark eyes peeking through and goes can i help you  taliesin are you gladys  matt i am  taliesin i think were supposed to talk my names caduceus mother sent me  matt make a persuasion check with advantage  travis hes a damn serial killer i knew it calm motherfucker  marisha mother sent me  /none/ taliesin thats not terrible 12  matt she peeks in and looks at you and may the grace of melora bring us to talk and it closes  and you hear locks clicking it creaks open and for as high as the slip was the womans heads about  two feet lower than where it was theres a stepping stool thats attached to the back  of the door as it opens up slightly and she escorts you in slightly and the woman you see  if you can imagine a more burly after working physically every day estelle getty /dung/ a little wider  she has no sleeves on this long working dress and leather apron or uniform that she wears  her arms while the skin itself is sagging and wrinkled there are some guns on this  old woman her hair is a tuft of tightly curled white hair no glasses just the beady little  dark eyes where she smiles the wrinkles cause this butterfly effect across the rest of her face  liam and human  matt human yes so you invoked the mother i assume you are also a follower of hers  taliesin i /dung/ am i am this is a long and complicated story i suppose weve been holding  the north against something dark something threatens our small temple have you ever been to  the blooming grove before  matt i cannot say that i have my apologies  taliesin its quite all right this has been the first sign of the mother ive seen since leaving  my home  matt well im happy that she could be a beacon to you as shes been to so many who have  passed through nicodranas  laura shes a really big beacon /none/  taliesin her temple is under threat up north i was waiting for a sign and i think this is the sign  matt perhaps her guidance is going to be very useful to you in seeking out a way to cleanse this  temple you speak of  taliesin yes im so sorry how rude my friends and i its only fitting is there any service  that we can provide for you for your graciousness in allowing us into your lighthouse  matt i cannot guarantee entry to the top at least and peeks around behind to the /none/ rest of you  sam and laura hi  matt hello  liam hallo  laura do you sleep in the boob  matt no  travis the triple blink afterwards  matt i dont know if i can be of much help to you i am but a simple mistress of the tower but  taliesin i feel that there is wisdom here would it be possible to learn more about this place possibly  matt i can tell you of its history come in  taliesin thank you  sam all of us noisy out here  matt /none/ sure  marisha so many horses on this lighthouse  matt yep kept trying to find the right audio file and now this kept coming up real busy  travis we shoot horses outside just on tuesdays  matt its a really busy wharf guys anyway fuck me for trying to add atmosphere right  liam hes juggling a lot of plates  sam we know  matt i know  liam please last week i was like how does this shit work what do i do here  matt its all good as she lets you all in with /none/ a bit of a grimace she goes all right this is the lighthouse  laura its really nice  matt it is of the mother melora looks over those ships at sea keeps them safe  sam not just the ships at sea but farmers as well right  matt probably but the lighthouse mainly helps the sea  sam sure  laura so this is kind of like a temple then  matt more or less  liam how long have you been presiding over it  matt i have been here for the entirety of my life for /none/ now 86 years in nicodranas  liam that is respectable  laura you climb all these stairs all the time  matt yes thats how ive gotten to this age and still as spry as ever starts walking up the  first set of stairs come you should see the view  taliesin im very excited  travis oh my god i love her  sam as we walk i know this was our way in or whatever but weve got to cut to the chase at  some point right  taliesin what chase  sam theres been a /none/ lot of forepony but we need to get to the actual  laughter  travis oh fucking callback amazing  laura what are we supposed to ask about  sam about the guy about al gore dyomin  taliesin well get there  marisha we should call him al gore  sam al gore he invented the internet  taliesin its an inconvenient moment right now  travis fuck your character names  matt every time you do it just adds more hit points  laughter  taliesin were having a moment right now  liam oh man you just /none/ triple lutzed over purvan and flew beyond  travis so good  sam but we need to ask about the guy that we came to ask about so wrap up the god stuff  matt so here in this tower the lady looks over us those who wish to have her guidance to prevent  dangerous storms at sea or the draw of the tide to bring them to the depths are wise to leave for  her some gift before they traverse on their journey you will see here is the viewing window  tis not for sleeping and /none/ it is not the mothers boob  laura oh its her eyeballs  matt you glance up and you can see now there is a window thats set right about where the clavicle is  laura just kidding its where her clavicle is  liam so its past the boob  matt its a beautiful view of the entire harbor especially this time of day when the suns at its  peak you see this beautiful set of ships out there and fishing vessels and galleons and a  handful of different designs to each different make from all over /none/ the world theres one that  appears to be of marquesian make you can even see through the very clear ocean waters here you can  see shapes far below the waves from this view as well you can see elements of a reef in the  distance you can see a few broken and long siltcovered remnants of ships that had sunk in  this harbor from long ago its breathtaking in a way you werent expecting you can keep gawking  if that is your preference but the lighthouse is up top follow me  taliesin exciting  /none/ matt to the top floor you have the view of everything around you not just that front view  of the harbor but this beautiful image of the ocean and the shoreline and the fields and rolling  hills that surround nicodranas of the cyrios mountains to the north and then far to the east  you can see the jungles that then vanish up the sides of the ashkeeper peaks its a tremendous  view and then the entire city below its once again increasingly breathtaking from the one you  previously had this is my home  laura /none/ this is a really good home  taliesin its beautiful  liam its a lot of steps i can see why youre in such good shape grandmother  matt damn right you should keep up do more cardio  laura you get a lot of visitors here  matt no not really  laura really but its so cool inside why dont people want to come see you  matt kind of prickly  laura and marisha no  matt no seriously if your friend with the pink hair wasnt here i wasnt going to let you in  sam /none/ hes a good one  taliesin im not even looking at the view im looking at the lighthouse  matt now that youve focused on this there are no windows to the lighthouse theres a metal  structure that holds up the top this faint 15by15 foot dome that marks the ceiling of it  each of these openings between these metal rods that holds that up are where the light protrudes  you can see now the marine layer starting to burn away in the midday and most of the fog is  receded towards the horizon the blue /dung/ sky having returned you see this roughcut quartzlike  crystal thats about three and a half four feet in diameter thats set in the center of this top floor  taliesin im going to compare it to mine a little bit  matt it is my responsibility to invoke the mothers blessing of the stone and each day have  its light guide the ships back to safe shore  taliesin i have my own responsibilities to her as well  matt i can sense even looking upon you i can smell decay  taliesin this place its so different /none/ was it perhaps a gift from the lawbearer long ago  matt that is very astute of you it was at a time when their temperaments were less in conflict  they two the union blessed upon this shore the gifts of stone that then built this tower  taliesin it is beautiful i will admit we have many tasks that weigh upon us that bring us here  i have two favors that i would ask of you and i understand if theyre not possible  matt well i can maybe help with one and probably laugh at the /town/ other so choose carefully  taliesin very fair we have a friend in town in need of a good turn and this good turn we have  a friend whos threatened and were hoping to maybe glean some information  laura its my mom  taliesin its my friends mother  laura a mother so theres your in right there  matt cute  taliesin shes having difficulty with somebody  sam al gore dyomin  laura algar  sam algar dyomin  matt ive seen this man around in the streets below  sam youve just seen him from /none/ above have you ever talked to him or any of his  matt no i dont really talk to people i look at them below she points over to the edge and  theres actually a spyglass leaning against the edge she goes i see a lot that goes on in this city  taliesin do you perhaps see the thing beneath the city  matt no but i know there are things beneath it  taliesin i fear that he may be in contact with something inappropriate  laura do you see where he goes  matt there are /none/ a couple of places i believe  laura do you know where he lives  matt i do not know where he lives  laura can i look through your spyglass please  sam wait tell us where  matt make a persuasion check with disadvantage  laura easily distracted  sam its shiny  laura its shiny  taliesin with disadvantage  laura aw why though 11  matt as you instinctually reach for the spyglass she slaps your hand no  laura why though  matt because it is my eye in the sky not yours insolent child /none/  taliesin keep on target  liam but it seemed like you were about to discuss youve seen his pattern in the city  where he goes day to day  matt depending when he disappears to do most of his work beneath in the sluice something  there are two submerged gates in the harbor  liam the sluice weave perhaps you are talking about  matt the sluice weave yes not that youd know that technically  liam you said sluice weave oh they said it eh shit happens forget it  matt its fine its all good /none/  liam banished from the game  matt i know youre done caleb is murdered no  taliesin meta that sluice there  sam pigeon cooing sluice weave  matt metagaming seagull  laughter  sam i killed like seven of them already  taliesin oh boy  sam two submerged gates under the harbor  matt sighs the harbor has protectors and has for many generations that exist beneath the  waters in this city that is part of how the sluice functions i believe this algar person you  mentioned works in some sort of managerial position there /none/  laura at the sluice  sam at the sluice so we go there and we can go down do we have to swim to get in there  matt probably need some sort of a small boat or something but if youre going to go there and you  dont have approval youll probably be arrested  laura oh i dont want to be arrested  taliesin im sure we can figure something out  matt are you a goblin  sam do i look like a goblin  matt yes  travis shit  sam i um people /none/ have told me that that i do look like a goblin um im a goblin  laughter  matt and youre working with these people  sam they looked past my hideous features to  laura youre not hideous  matt shes pretty hideous  liam she is invaluable to us she is a capable woman we need her  taliesin she does good work  sam i may be ugly on the outside but inside i am  laura youre wonderful and youre beautiful on the outside too  liam youre hardly ugly on the outside  matt look /none/ its okay it is something we have in common  sam what do you mean  matt what do you think ive lived alone here my whole live because im a spinster  sam well i mean you seem like a relatively normallooking person  matt scoffs its okay  laura i think youre beautiful  liam i think you could snap me like a twig  matt i think i could too  taliesin i do have my last request and ill take these people out of your hair  matt please theyre beginning to grate on me  /none/ taliesin im looking for a sign of where to go next im waiting for the mother to speak is  there a place to sit quietly and find her voice  matt laughs  laura thats the laughing thing she said  taliesin ah thats fair for your trouble im going to pull out one of my teas  matt sniffs what is this  taliesin its blessed from the mother herself from one of the graves of the less scrupulous  families of the north good for muscle tension i find grew it myself  matt this is a /none/ very kind gesture very thoughtful  taliesin you serve the mother well its only fair that you be rewarded  matt you as well all right now get out  taliesin thank you for your time  matt sets it down on a little side table and quickly pushes you back towards the stairs  laura does she start walking us down the stairs  matt yeah above you  liam that was a long walk though this is an awkward goodbye  travis youre not ganking that telescope  laura im not trying to gank the telescope  taliesin /none/ shes trying to get in the boob  laura maybe i am  matt what are you trying to do  laura well i wanted to before she started ushering us out to invoke duplicity and make it  look like i was in front her but really stay behind  sam oh boy  taliesin this is going to end poorly  matt make a stealth check  liam i was also going to say as they went down that caleb is going to make a big todo and start  saying you know we didnt have a chance /none/ to talk about when were above i am in the market for  some books and i was wondering if you knew of any bookstores  laura oh im going to give myself the blessing of the trickster  matt you got to do that beforehand  laura motherfuck  sam how did it go  liam did you call dibs on the dodeca  laura no eight not stealthy  matt as youre heading down the stairs you jump off to the side in that small alcove where the  window is and then a second one of you /none/ appears she begins to walk past you then stops and turns  right and looks right at you and goes are you going to join your friend of you  laughter  laura mmhmm yeah im coming downstairs  matt good go  sam come on jessie  laura okay shit  travis ive mastered standing so still  liam but you know a fullon library or perhaps you know a smutty bookshop even because you  never know what youre going to find in there or even a used a vintage book oh youre not  even shouting are /none/ there any bookstores in the vicinity of this lighthouse  matt as she pushes you all shes not answering any more questions shes like out out out  out you both of you her hands pass through your duplicitous image she goes thats strange  okay out thank you for the tea goodbye goodbye goodbye  liam yes but  matt door slamming locks clicking  laura have you heard of our lord and savior the traveler  taliesin i thought she was really nice  laura shes pretty cool i liked her a lot  liam i dont think /none/ she liked most of us but shes pretty cool  laura she loved us we were great me and my duplicate skip away  sam all right lets go its midday we got to go to the open quay  taliesin did you mean for that to rhyme or was that just  sam its been rhyming a lot  taliesin its the first time i got it  matt beauregard whats your passive perception  marisha my passive perception 13  matt 13  marisha 13  matt oh theyre down here actually okay good to know all right /none/ you guys eventually meet up  laura how long have we been outside now  matt you guys have been outside probably about three hours or so total of travel and asking and  getting questions id say two and a half  sam are you keeping your just spelling and spelling and spelling  laura im doing my disguise spell and keeping it up the whole time  sam damn  matt yeah  sam we should get you a disguise  laura that probably would be smarter than what im doing  matt you guys eventually gather in /dung/ the center of the open quay this is the western side of the  docks on the city whereas the restless wharf seems to be a really busy dockyard that runs a  very tight ship and seems to be filled with elements of cheap entertainment and in that vein  the open quay its a little a little bit smaller it seems to be less organized but in the center  of it is this one massive tower that looms over the entire district of this side of the docks  its an emerald stone dark green with elements /town/ of light green flecked through it spire that  seems very out of place amongst the rest of the storage buildings and the various other small  homesteads and businesses that fill this entire area it seems to be dotted with a number of small  balconies and comes to a slight roofed peak that is like a sharpened point its very out of place  here youve passed by it a couple times before but you havent really inquired much about it as  most of your business here had been on the job so youve not really cared /town/ to ask or question  travis i was going to say as were walking can we snag a passerby and ask what that structure is  matt sure you grab an older fisherman thinning hair very sunweathered face is carrying a small  sack over his shoulder various supplies and coiled rope over the other shoulder as hes  heading off towards the docks stops and turns can i help you  travis raspy voice yes were new in town and couldnt help but notice that structure there  very unique what is it  matt thats tide peak thats /none/ the tower of yussa errennis the mage who owns this district  travis theres a mage that owns this district  matt yes to the chagrin of the clovis concord yes  marisha the chagrin  travis they dont get on do they  matt you could say that i need to get to work  liam yussa renis  matt yussa yussa  sam yussa errenis  matt errenis errenis  liam we got a wizards tower  laura wizards tower flank up it  taliesin thats where you find carpets i was about to say yep  laura /none/ lead us to the carpet  travis around the tide peak do we see the zolezzo the guards around it or is it not as  guarded as other structures are  matt there are zolezzo around the area theyre still keeping the peace here but there are no  zolezzo guarding the tower  travis are we far away hundreds of feet less  matt yeah a few hundred feet i would say from the tower  marisha and it stands out like a sore thumb  matt yeah  travis im sure a detour wouldnt hurt us  /town/ marisha i mean its on the way  travis a closeup scenic  marisha you know its fine exactly  travis lets do it well make a detour to go closer to that on the way to the open quay  matt okay you approach it the district distinctly around this tower the road is very  wide surrounding it no buildings are buttressed against it it seems to be solitary amongst the  rest of the constructed buildings here  marisha like people deliberately trying to stay away from it  matt the folks that are walking in the /town/ streets nearby tend to walk on the opposite side of the road  travis no bodies of water pools lakes decorative  matt nope its just ground its built in the center of this district and everythings either  built or shaped around it  marisha does it look like its been there for a really long damn time  matt make an investigation check  marisha 15 wait nope 19 wrong thing  matt you get up to the tower and begin to inspect its build all the stones here look freshly cut  not a lot of wear /none/ and tear weathering to them its hard to tell how long its been here it  seems like it couldve been installed last week or 25 30 years ago  travis how close did beau get to investigate like that  matt about ten feet before you began to really make that assessment  travis i thought he said before you started to melt  marisha sizzling  travis weird that theyre avoiding the thing  marisha i mean these bricks look so new  travis and green why so different can we touch the outside of it  matt /none/ you go and touch it its cold stone  travis do you see an entrance  marisha did i see an entrance  matt not yet  marisha no  travis is it a super long like a tower  matt yeah its a tower spire but the base of it is probably somewhere between 80 to  100 feet in diameter  travis how about we nonchalantly walk by the entrance to get an idea  marisha okay do you want to go that way and ill go that way meet around okay  matt okay you guys run /none/ around meet on the other side no entrance  marisha the fuck  travis i didnt see a door  marisha no me neither  travis windows  matt no windows there are the balconies but the first balcony is maybe 25 feet up  sam are there flying carpet ports  marisha i know i keep thinking of alluras tower  travis 25feetup balcony and other balconies above that  matt yeah theyre sporadically cast around it at its peak its probably about 450 feet tall  travis oh shit its real tall  matt yeah its this long /none/ spire  sam oh dang  travis well how do you get into a tower with no doors  marisha id imagine you fly or maybe theres an underground entrance around go under and up  travis yep you cant parkour up that wall 25 feet can you  marisha are you asking me to try  travis yes  marisha all right you want to give me a boost  travis i absolutely would love it  marisha okay i want to see if i can boost off of fjord and maybe get up to this tower does it /none/ look  like these are bricks that can  travis 25 feet is pretty far  marisha its very high wait 25 feet 45 feet 25 feets a lot  liam this is the worlds largest mimic  matt no and to help the visual thing i said 100 feet wide diameter thats a bit wide for what i  was originally thinking its about maybe 60 feet  marisha in diameter but can i climb up to the balcony  matt thats your estimation from this fore point make an acrobatics check  travis im helping her im giving /town/ her the old grunting  marisha acrobatics acrobatics  sam broad daylight scaling a building  marisha yeah one hundred percent a terrible idea a building that everyone is trying to avoid  in town 17  matt you have advantage because hes helping you  marisha not that one cobalt  travis ugh  marisha ill take the 17 i know it was almost a 20  matt you run leap fjord catches your foot and gives you the meager not very strong lift but  something to help your first foot hits the wall the second one hits /none/ and you get a moment of  traction before you slipping you only get maybe 12 13 feet off the ground before you impact  travis i did not catch her  marisha oh you dived out of the way  matt fjord steps back and you whack  marisha catch me ca what  liam goosh  marisha my ass bone  travis im sorry im not real strong i thought youd make it up  marisha i thought i would too its really slippy stone  travis youre getting damage because of that  liam yeah 1d6 per /none/ ten feet  marisha yeah i already know this math  laughter  matt thankfully you have slow fall as a monk ability  marisha i do which ive never had to use  matt you would take six points of bludgeoning damage from the fall  marisha but i reduce my damage five times my monk level up to 20  sam oh thats all of it  matt yeah monks can fall from very high and threepoint landing and be fine you still hit  your tailbone and it still stings a little but you dont take any /none/ damage  travis well let the others know okay and well go to the open quay  laura arent you supposed to fall gracefully as a monk then  liam did you reach up as hard as you could right before you landed to split that speed  is that how monks work  marisha yes definitely  matt you guys round the corner and you watch beau suddenly slam into the ground near the  central tower  sam yep theres our friends  laura ay thats beau  sam whats going on why are you jumping up and /none/ down  marisha oh i was just doing some onefinger pushups  travis we were trying to get into the tower theres no doors  liam why were you trying to get into this tower  travis well ive seen it several times coming through before its called the tide peak but  there are no doors  liam well okay ive seen all kinds of places many times that i didnt try to get into  immediately what were you trying to accomplish  travis did they have doors  liam sure so you saw it as a challenge /none/ you saw it as a mountain to climb  travis yeah everybody seems to be avoiding it it sticks out in the general area and theres no  doors i just found it odd maybe its a puzzle  marisha also apparently hes a wizard that has a beef  laura maybe we can blink into it  travis oh maybe they said theres a mage here that presides over this district  liam thats interesting how does it pertain to what we are trying to do today  travis and laura it doesnt  sam thank you for keeping /none/ us on task caleb  travis jester do you know anything about this tower  sam no but we do know about the sluice we heard about a place called the sluice  travis we heard the same  sam thats where this fellow algar might be  marisha the sluice weave  sam no it was just called the sluice  travis pretty sure its the sluice weave  laura its underwater or something  marisha yeah  sam did you find it  marisha no we just heard about it  sam lets go find it  laura /none/ we need to get a boat but we cant just go there because well be arrested  travis why  laura dont know the old lady said that  travis oh you need an invite  laura yeah  sam its a gate that protects the city from bad underwater creatures or something  marisha well we heard the whole thing was underwater did you hear that like submerged  laura something like that submerged gates or something  marisha yeah  liam but we dont have to go we could keep working on this tower  marisha you know /none/ i feel like youre throwing a lot of shade about us investigating this tower  travis we were here on time you know  marisha yeah we were killing time it is midday we are at the quay  sam beau  marisha what  sam he gets a little picky when he hasnt had a book in a while so we just need to find him  a book and hell be okay for a bit  marisha i mean you would think the wizard would be fascinated with the idea of the wizard tower  thats very mysterious /none/ in the middle of the city  liam it is very interesting but i thought we were helping our friend here  marisha do you have wizard envy its okay its a very large tower  liam right thats an easy thing to go to so go to it  travis long and rather skinny so  sam what did you find  travis we did find out that marius lepual fuck that last name hes sometimes seen at some of the  taverns around some of the shadier ones the skew or the open quay  sam okay well /none/ were in a shady area right  laura mmhmm  sam so were close to marius lepual were also close to the sluice maybe is that close to here  marisha is that close to here  matt you dont really know  sam goddamn it  marisha well lets go into the quay we havent been in yet right  matt well the quay is the district youre in the district right now  travis yeah were in the district its like a wharf  marisha wait but the open quay was a lowlife dive right  sam its /tavern/ a lowlife area  marisha i thought the skew was the lowlife area  laura no the skew is a place where you can live  matt yeah its a heavily residential district for the more affordable and cheaper residents  marisha is the quay inside the skew  matt no  travis the meandering treasurer  matt the meandering treasurer is a shop  travis is a shop  marisha is there a bar  matt make an investigation check  sam lets go find a bar  liam thats our solution for everything  sam yeah i will /tavern/ aid  marisha okay please do okay okay okay thats 17 again nope sorry 15 keep looking at the  wrong numbers  matt if youre looking around the open quay there are a few people that point you towards the  withered bird inn which is an inn and tavern and youve probably passed by it before once the  direction is pointed out youre like yeah no ive been there its a little divey but its popular  amongst the sailors and folks that come through if youre looking for something in the restless  wharf the only /none/ place that really comes to your attention thats told is the wayfarers cove  sam weve been told about that place  travis yeah  sam yeah thats where they said marius lepual might hang out  travis yeah wayfarers cove is is supposed to be delivered to marius  sam thats why  travis and laura we should go there  sam lets go there  laura were stupid we could have gone there already  sam but were not looking for marius lepual were looking for al gore  laura algar  sam algar but we should still /none/ go there because we can maybe kill two birds  laura well youve already got seven dead birds  sam ive got seven dead birds  matt more birds must die  taliesin we get nine birds its nine  travis we got to take whats given to us and right now we dont have an invite to get down to  the sluice so we might as well go by the wayfarers cove  sam but were in the quay how far away in the wayfarers cove  liam oh boy  matt its maybe 30 minutes away  /none/ sam 30 fucking minutes  travis were going were on the way were going unless you want to fuck with this tower a  little bitthe tower is super interesting to me its 400 feet tall no doors  sam well come back to the tower well go to the wayfarers cove  travis can you climb 25 feet  liam we were at a lighthouse that is even taller than this you we could go try to climb that if  youd like  marisha okay once again with the shade towards trying to climb the tower  liam /none/ it is open shade beauregard because it has nothing to do with what we are trying to do today  i am not hiding my shade it is out i am providing shade for you we have something  to do yeah i am blotting out the sun we have shit to do  marisha no you blot out the sun everywhere you go caleb  travis ooh salt  marisha lets go  matt you make your way out of the open quay towards the restless wharf district once more fjord  travis yes  matt you keep looking /town/ over your shoulder your interest towards the tide peak tower its  interesting the further away from it you get the shorter it looks and you begin to understand how  you didnt notice a 400foot tower when you first entered the city or one youve been around before  and youve been to this city before it seems the further away you walk the tower seems to visually  shrink within the city skyline its still visible as a tower and its still taller than most of the  buildings but as soon as you guys get quite a /none/ ways away youre like that cant be more than  maybe 150 feet tall  travis we are continuing on but i just want to point out that the place with no doors  also fucking shrunk  liam fjord 100 it is very interesting and i have checked the box in the back of my brain i do  want to understand what that place is  travis yeah it tickles your pickle doesnt it  liam hmm im curious but lets shelve it  laura has yussa ever come to see my mom sing  matt no  /tavern/ travis within somethings up mmhmm  marisha i mean this is coming from the guy who spent two hours in a smut shop trying to find magic  liam i know that youre embarrassed for wasting your time here but you will get over it  laura lets find the bar please  sam guys look at this cute puppy look at this adorable puppy its such a cutie pie  travis make it do the thing  sam make it blink  laura poof  matt it vanishes and then you hear poof and you look over your shoulder /none/ one of the small  tables on the side of one of the various warehouses that contained a bucket that had a bunch of tools  and various repair materials for ships has been knocked over and the puppys tumbling out of it  laura oh poof  sam we have to go save our puppy come on  matt runs up to you and jumps back into your arms  laura that was so close that was really close to us that time  sam aww its so cute right guys  liam thats what i really want you /none/ know how little puppies they crash into things when theyre  theyre walking every time he poofs out i just want  matt thats basically what he is  marisha hes a fainting blink dog  sam hes cute though right  matt puppies are useless at this age man  sam im just saying hes cute so lets be friends again and lets just keep going  matt finishing the rest of your jaunt here as fjord is making equations in the air in front of  him you eventually make your way by asking a few more questions /dung/ towards the wayfarers cove as  you approach this dark looking dive that is probably furthest of all the other bars or taverns  youve seen here out towards the docks itself the super dark wood that its constructed of makes it  look almost like a blighted barnacle on the rest of this wharf area as you approach the exterior  you can see a large piece of driftwood that probably belonged to a ship long before that had  either fallen in the ocean or after its final voyage was pulled apart and then elements of it  /tavern/ were used to either build or embellish on the structure it looks like the kind of bar that was  salvaged or was built from salvage  marisha whispers rad i know so cool  matt as you step through the entry way the doors open slightly ajar you pull it open the  interior has no music there is just whispers and conversation the smell hits you immediately the  smell is a combination of mossy musk from wood that has been soaked with seawater and then left  to dry hundreds of times over as well as the /tavern/ various forms of liquor and ale that have been  spilled and left to stain the wood where it lies and a lot unwashed sailor scent  laura ugh  matt yeah the odor in here is not pleasant definitely that of the working man or woman who  comes in from the sea glancing inside there is a bar to the immediate left where there is a rather  crotchety looking fellow halfelf who is heavily scarred on one side of his face a bit heavy set  for a halfelf for the elven lineage its rare to see /tavern/ someone who has not displayed the more  lithe side of the blood line but this elf has either worked hard to fight that side of their  bloodline and has a bit of a paunch and a bit of a soft chin and jawline he looks over to you and  nods he goes let me know if you need a drink or something spits off to the side looking  inside glancing about the small number of patrons here theres only five of them at the bar this  time of day you see one really old salty /dung/ looking sailor who has this heavy cap pulled down over his  ears to the point where he has these bushy white eyebrows that poof underneath where the fold of it  brims upward and has this big puffed chinstrap beard around the side his lips are pressed up to  where you can tell he probably has no teeth so his jaw can press all the way up towards the roof  of his mouth and hes sitting there with a large dark green bottle of some sort of beer or ale and  is just staring forward chewing /tavern/ quietly off to the right hand side you see for some of you the  first time what looks to be a very very large humanoid turtle you see them sitting on a bench  youve seen a few tortles in your travels but they dont normally travel northward into the  empire this one is sitting there hunched over a table by themself with a heavy tankard that  theyre clutching with both of their hands you see bits of rope that are tied across in a lattice  over elements of the shell and on the right side /none/ of the shell you see emerging three pipes or  horns of some kind that are either carved or embedded on the right side of the shell it looks  like three exhaust pipes if you will but theyre made from some sort of ivorytype material they  look chipped a little bit and worn as it turns back its extended head and a snapjaw type nose  curves back and you see an eye patch over the right eye and just grins you see these series of  tattoos up each arm that look like swirling water that curl /none/ into themselves and end right at the  forearm it goes back to its drink and sips a bit from it you see another patron in the far back is  a woman with weathered darkbrown skin the hair itself is this tattered wild mass of  curled and crimped hair thats graying heavily towards the tips she has a long light brown coat  made of leatherlike material that probably hangs down to the floor from where shes sitting and  where her calfhigh boots are visible from under the side shes sitting across from somebody whos  dressed /dung/ as a readytoaction shipmate they have a basic billowing shirt that is opened down to the  mid chest they have a ruddier complexion probably sunburned over and over again to the  point where now it just looks like theyre perpetually sunburned he looks younger probably  in his 20s the woman looks maybe in her mid to late 40s or so both human and they both glance  over as you enter the dark interior contrasted by the very bright light that silhouettes your  figures as you step within the wayfarers cove and thats where were going /none/ to pick up next week  laura fuck so awesome  marisha it was so awesome  taliesin i like turtles  marisha the tower
