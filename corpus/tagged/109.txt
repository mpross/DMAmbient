the group  laura but only with allies that /none/ weve traveled with not vox machina  liam not vox machina keyleth would be a great ally no come back to me then  laura allura  liam do they have to be a friend could they have been an enemy  laura but is it a trial by fisticuffs  marisha man we are way overcomplicating this we are overthinking this way too much  laura i just need to know  marisha people wonder why vox machina does this were just like this  liam i mean part of me would like to run with delilah briarwood yeah /none/  laura i feel like vex is getting close to that anyways so  taliesin wow  ashley i feel like id have to go with my triedandtrue my bestie grog i do actually  feel like we would be a really good combo though because youre the brains and im the brawn  laughter

hah i used to do broadway  laughter  marisha next question  brian all right thats good thank you whats your name  justin justin  all hi justin  justin hi so my home dd group also happens to include a lot of stage and /none/ improv actors from the  boston area and so i take a lot of inspiration from what you guys do and im wondering for any  of you the whole approach or the headspace youre in to do critical role does it have any  relationship to what you would do or how you would approach a stage role or an improv scripted role  is there a relation or is it totally different  liam oh yeah some of us were talking in the green room before coming out here right before the  show started i spent years /none/ in the theater and its been ten years since my last one and three  years ago i was like man im getting really itchy ive got to get back on stage and thats  gone this scratches that itch so much and were living in a role for five years is it five  years  marisha yeah in a weird way it feels like the longest longform improv  laura i feel like the preparation for it can be very similar i feel like we slid our way into our  backstories and everything like that we had /none/ loose ideas of what it was before we started playing a  lot but when youre starting a new role in a theater show what am i talking about then yeah  you would do the same thing you would establish all of those ties in your mind and you would  figure out what is their favorite music to listen to and what kind of food do they like and all  that kind of stuff and its the same stuff you do with this  marisha yeah part of the reason we did the playlists is because we /none/ were all already doing  them and then we thought awesome well publish them out and the playlists i think its  actually a good tip for people trying to find their character who might be new to it is build a  playlist for your character it informs a lot and it gets you in the mood right before you go  laughter  taliesin yeah its good for the drive over you really get the headspace  brian let the bodies hit the lava is that on your playlist  marisha yeah  travis those are actually all /none/ on my playlist these are the songs  laughter  travis just rage and death and destruction  laura what is it c is for cookie that was one year  marisha yes cute  travis always learning  laughter  matt awesome thank you so much

that i cant think straight oh my god dd  crossovers what a crazy idea  marisha can we jump into shield of tomorrow and do a star trek crossover  taliesin i would love to do a star trek crossover ive got to admit  marisha im /none/ into that  matt oh my god vox machina in star trek would be so horrible  laughter  brian look at all the shield of tomorrow people going bring it on  sam yeah scanlan would spend a lot of time in the holodeck  laughter  liam knocks what are you doing in there  sam one more minute  laura ive always wondered about the holodeck in that way because  liam just because they dont put it in the episodes doesnt mean it doesnt happen  laura it has to happen right you have an entire /dung/ crew of people that are like hums  sam that room must be so nasty  laura i know maybe they have a secondary holodeck you know what i mean  matt im not going to dungeon master your holodeck experiences guys im sorry i got close  enough with an audiobook once and that was weird in its own right  liam id like to see vox machina skinned into cyberpunk i think  laura thats actually valkana  liam its more blade runnery a little bit whatever  laura i think they would all get along with lemley /none/ so well  matt that was an awesome question  brian thank you so much manleth  matt vax if you are that intrigued alter self she can use at will  laughter  liam im aware  marisha once again never mind  liam just because vax has never pooped in an episode of critical role and you havent seen it  doesnt mean it doesnt happen  laura vex doesnt poop im just putting that out there she never poops ever  matt vaxdoesntpoop  liam not anymore  laura oh do you eat  liam i dont /none/ know  laura oh no how are you going to have a heroes feast  liam well find out  matt next question  brian yeah weve got to move on or were going to get spoilery  audience member so the rest did enough questions so super nerdy inquiry to matt about old school  dd since youve introduced the current arc and you start going to the upper planes of the gods  pretty much all i can think about is the final add book die vecna die its an essential  story about him and im wondering /none/ ive been going through the campaign book and looking at  your pantheon and so forth and have you considered the stuff from those old stories in  regards to the serpent and lady of pain and sigil and the stuff above the gods if you have that  figured out and those cosmology and whether it will come out either in this campaign or  eventually i assume they fight tharizdun in the next campaign  matt right i take a lot of inspiration from elements of that vecna story because vecnas such  an intrinsic villain to dd /none/ lore to change him too much would be upsetting to me and a lot of  you guys as well there is a lot of expectation there so i want to make him unique to this  campaign in this world because hes definitely not the exact same character there are elements  of that that are classic lore that are pulled into this that may be revealed in the future  especially now that were releasing campaign guides and this has become a world now that we can  bring to you guys to play in i have to /none/ be careful to not pull in too much of the very licensed dd  lore otherwise we would have to reskin everything and you all are like oh wait which  ones which oh no im trying to keep that to a minimum but if you know a lot about vecna  laura then tell us  matt then dont tell them anything  laura tell us his weaknesses  matt dont listen to her  liam this is the perfect time to segue into our next comiccon announcement though which is in  season three we are converting to /none/ first edition dd  matt the characters will die before you get artwork done  brian okay next question thank you very much hey whats your name  sean hi my name is sean  matt marisha and laura hi sean  sean hi i actually saw matt first in front of me for the thundercats panel in this room  matt yeah oh way back then oh man  sean my question is actually related to that how much critical roles grown over the years im  sure none of you expected it to grow to this type of /none/ audience and i still remember the days when  you were reading all the donations even on stream do any of you miss anything from those  early days when it was still such a small show  liam i liked eating fried chicken on set  laura that was great  marisha i feel like we cant go through all the fanart we do but after the aftershow reactions  and responses we cant really go through it as much anymore  taliesin it was much easier were getting to a point were like whoa  travis excuse me /none/  taliesin i miss when the correspondence was more manageable as opposed to this is something i have  to set aside time every day to do it but yeah thats the one thing i miss oh five minutes a  week i can deal with this  brian does anyone miss shooting in a threeyearold childs bedroom  laura it was pretty i liked it  brian me too i was just wondering  liam the race car bed was just out of camera i mean i love what were doing now but i also  liked we were /none/ still dumb idiots at the beginning of the show we didnt have the weight of the  world on our shoulders really so it was nice being carefree  matt sorry what am i supposed to do at level 16  liam exactly what youre doing  matt some clown scared a family things get a little heavy in the later levels but well get  back to the carefree feeling probably in the next campaign  laura when were all dead  laughter  brian great question  matt for me i guess what i miss a little bit /none/ is the anonymity to go into the dealers hall but  other than that i wouldnt change anything this is amazing this is amazing  brian put on ivans demogorgon outfit and wander the floor and nobody will know its you  laura you could put on a mask  matt well now i cant do that costume thanks brian  brian i might have not thought that through all the way he said to a microphone thank you for  the question though youre awesome youre great hey whats up all right were going to  have to lightninground /none/ this because weve got about seven minutes left so go ahead  mc all right hi my names mc really quick what has surprised you about all of your guys  character developments and i guess for matt the world developments that have come up over the  past few years  matt for me surprised that people want to play there and everythings been reactionary creating  the campaign guide was reactionary that wasnt our idea green ronin came to us they were like  you want to do a campaign guide okay so were amazed that people have /dung/ interest in them  laura um  sam skip her  laura no oh its lightning round shit shoot no im surprised that she is willing to take  responsibility for more than just herself and her brother and her bear  liam never thought that vax would get dark as he has it ties into the last question i thought we  were like a couple of han solo characters for our entire home campaign at the beginning of the  campaign and would never have predicted that it would be so freaking serious ever  sam i was /dung/ surprised that taryon lasted longer than two episodes and thats it  ashley i think most recently im surprised i didnt realise pike would ever be able to have  wings thats pretty good  taliesin i was expecting percy to end a terrible mess and it somehow has not happened hes  actually kind of a functional human being which was not the plan ever  marisha i think its that the developments never over the world is always affecting the way you  go keyleth fell from pretty high and got dark literally smeared on broken rocks that /none/ was  shocking ill pick that  liam that was not in your vision  marisha no  liam this ones for keyleth thuds  travis i was surprised grog became the smartest member of the group  cheering  travis that happened right  brian thank you whos up next  mikelyn hi guys my name is mikelyn i was wondering matt what scenario were you most proud  of throwing at the group or what is your favorite kind of scenario to throw at them  matt timed scenarios dd is a lot of planning and arguing and /none/ trying to figure things out and  theres game time versus planning time and i love a scenario where i can tell the players well  you have this much time to do both go it ups the intensity so i love me my hourglasses  definitely  liam stupid rakshasa  mikelyn thank you  matt thank you  brian next question whats your name  alex hi im alex thank you ashley for gortys because shes the most adorable character ever  laura shes pretty great  alex thank you laura for lucina because she is the best /none/ and matt what time is it  marisha man almost got through a panel  matt mccree voice its about 34 minutes till its high noon  cheering  alex thank you  liam panels mexican restaurants the dentists office  brian anywhere  matt i am so conscious of what time it is at all times now  laughter  brian all right go ahead man whats your name  alex my name is alex really quickly couple years ago i attended my first panel with you  guys i had no direction now im auditioning for things all /none/ because of the advice and inspiration  you guys have given  applause  alex as a fellow dm matt if youre able to tell us for the next campaign its going to be  chronologically after this current timeline or is it going to be before  matt yeah ive mentioned a little bit i think but the next campaign im planning to be  roughly 20 or so years beyond the end of this campaign and its going to be in a different  continent and theres a possibility depending on which characters and npcs survive this final /none/ arc  theyll be existing somewhere in the world  ashley what  laura so we could visit ourselves if we live yells oh man thats so cool  sam reveal  liam i remember your greatgreatgrandfather trunket oh  laura oh trinket babies oh no tova you have to come back  laughter  brian oh my god what a sentence  matt next question  brian okay weve got time for one more its up to you  audience member one more so for all the couples on the stage how do you guys deal with each other /none/  after the game you guys have the car rides home how do you deal with some of those more  intense moments that somebody gets something matt you may have killed a character or whatever  i cant get through a game of monopoly with my wife without going to bed angry how do you guys  deal with it  marisha i push him out the window at the taco bell  matt yeah seriously calm down taco bells definitely after an intense session like driving  scratch the knee you want taco bell mopey voice yes okay /none/  travis thats insane because we live ten 15 minutes from you guys and we do the same shit  marisha yeah  travis we have our own taco bell im like why did you take my deck of many things laura  marisha i feel like for us at the end of the game for matt hes like sighs done for the  week and im just getting revved up  matt why did you ever get the thought it was me going oh done for the week its me going  im sorry its what the story did /dung/  marisha im just saying your stress seems to happen before the game and mine happens after so  the whole time im like i mean i dont know whats the raven queens deal is she to be  trusted i dont know and hes like  travis you dont know  marisha im just talking to a brick wall  matt you want to talk about people that prod though travis every given moment turns to me and  goes so whats this item do you dont know and hell go ugh  travis hes
