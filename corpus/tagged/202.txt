none	 you  guys have a lot of homework to do and a lot of stats to think about  matt yeah yeah  liam ill have to figure out how assassinate works  brian some of you could start learning the rules of the game  matt thatd be nice  brian well stay tuned to the gs socials for all those details so ladies and gentlemen without  further ado lets begin now the way that we have decided to break this up is were going to  discuss the entire adventures of vox machina however we know that 
none	 it didnt begin with  critical role vox machina actually began at a home game which was a version of pathfinder and  then for critical role it transferred into what you guys are somehow getting away with calling  dungeons and dragons so we have broken up the show into five major arcs beginning with the  first arc which will cover episodes one through 23 kraghammer and vasselheim  musical crescendo  brian all right our first question for the first arc of the show is for anyone who wants to answer  except for matt this comes 
none	 from nerdyscotsman yes it is you can still say something if you  want youre just not allowed to answer the question why did you all trust a mindflayer more  than a holy paladin  laura because were vox machina  marisha we were such assholes yeah  taliesin shes not a polite paladin  laura well everyone likes the underdog right i mean thats why  travis its called the underdark  laura i mean he had been you know shunned by the rest of them so we thought he wanted to get  even  travis plus 
none	 you guys were super happy about what you found  laura yes very much  marisha that was a good moment man  laura but it didnt mean we didnt trust kima we just also trusted whispers clarota yeah  sam he charmed us with his handsome good looks  brian thats happened a few times over the campaign i think  liam we thought he was the diamond in the rough we thought he was the one the one that was  different than them all  brian travis tell me your thoughts youre shaking your head violently  
none	 travis i think i wrote five weeks in a row on my legal pad i dont trust clarota i dont trust  clarota  matt before you started chasing people with a mallet yeah sounds about right  brian matt question for you from jesse was there anything in the underdark areas you made  that the players missed or passed up encounters puzzles or any other areas of interest  matt yeah there was the dwarven city around or the duergar city around the emberhold which you  guys managed to circumvent for the most part that had some 
none	 possible encounters there and social  elements then within yugvoril itself the cavern there you saw the shimmer of a portal to the far  realm  laura oh yeah thats right  matt the far realm is the place beyond known space where weird creatures come from  laura could we have gone into that realm  matt if you stepped through that might not have ended well  laura and we all would have just died  taliesin we would have gone so star trek or something  marisha would we have just died or would it have 
dung	 been a whole totally other campaign  matt you know in event horizon when they  liam was that in the little side cave where we saw that  matt yeah it was around the northern side of the cavern of yugvoril and then there was the actual  city around the pyramid i had all this stuff planned for you guys making your way through the  city and then multiple layers for the actual pyramid this upward dungeon crawl into the top  with the battle of kvarn at the end and you guys went lets just fly 
none	 over and drop a giant on  it so that happened  brian incredible  marisha that was our little polymorph trick right we polymorphed the giant and then dropped  it that was fun  brian such babies then i have a feeling theres probably a lot of areas where stuff was missed and  they didnt get to  marisha plus we had that flying carpet which i know you just hated  laura you didnt want us to have the carpet  matt no i gave it to you guys and then i took it away and 
none	 then i gave it back  brian the dm giveth and the dm taketh away thats a tshirt right it should be put matt  mercers face on it and give me 10 our next question is for liam obrien the actor most known  from this show for playing vax this is from animlae what info did you get from insight  checking keyleth  laura do you remember  liam i do i do a little bit yeah the dm told me that keyleth seemed unsure and scared if im  remembering right and feeling cut off from 
none	 topside and it mightve been the first time  like the twins all throughout the home game and the beginning of the show i think our most common  shared response to a lot of your decisions was like and it was the first moment where i stopped  doing that  marisha interesting  brian stopped insight checking her  laura no stopped questioning  liam i dont know something about being on the show and the way matt whatever he phrased into  my ear made me look at your character in a new way  marisha aw 
none	 felt bad for little derpy keyleth felt a little bad just a little what was the  turning point i dont think ive ever asked you this question what was the turning point when you  were like oh maybe vax has a crushy  liam it mightve been that i dont know if it was that it was after that i stopped being so  snarky 100 of the time which allowed me to have different i dont know  marisha like every other adolescent male you stopped being an asshole and then realized  brian at what age 
none	 do you stop being that because i still am that im pretty sure travis you and  i are the prime examples of that marisha save us from traviss face with an answer to this question  from synchroraven can you delve into your own and keyleths insights on that vision she spoke of  having when she met the earth ashari  marisha okay my insights  brian your own and keyleths insights if you can  marisha well that was right after i killed the kid yeah the first one  sam you never forget your first  
none	 laughter  marisha because that was also one of the first big charactertype changing moments that happened  in our prestream game i remember talking to you about it and you were like you should probably  think about how this is going to affect keyleth you snapped a kids neck and i was like aw  shit now ive got to own this and so she basically was really depressed after that and had  lost herself and had continued on into her aramente where she went to the earth kingdom and  was having a hard time basically 
none	 functioning or fighting or doing any type of magic or  natureshifting so the vision ended up being my way of writing in her own epiphany and it was  more or less to represent the consequences of inaction in that vision i considered her to see  her death at the time it was so early that it was supposed to be a not meaning to be something to  ever come to fruition ever but yeah it was supposed to be her lesson to herself that you  figure it out or die  brian one of the 
none	 first of many lessons like that i think she was going to have what was the  biggest difference switching from the home game to streaming did you guys change anything about  your characters obviously you changed the ruleset and stuff like that was there anything about your  characters in the home game that you didnt want to bring into the stream or you chose not to or  that you changed or did it pretty much just smoothly you carried everything over  taliesin yeah i didnt feel anything  laura i feel like that was one 
none	 of the biggest things when we switched over and we started  filming the show was we didnt want anything to change from the home game  brian it was important to keep that  laura yeah  matt some abilities changed from the systems a little bit a little bit of relearning elements  of the classes and stuff like that  marisha and we changed our name  laura yeah from the shits  brian biggest regret so far changing the name from the shits  matt technically vox machina the name was taken during the ceremony in 
none	 which sovereign taldorei  had a giant parade for you guys  laura we had a reason for it because we knew we were going to be starting this stream  taliesin i think we wouldve changed the name anyway because we were making the noise of do we  want to be known as the shits because we have to start making a decision but even ingame we  were like are we the shits or are we  brian did anyone vote to stay the shits  sam i wanted to stay the shits  brian my man 
none	  marisha yeah it ended up being more of an rp thing from taliesin and keyleth or keyleth and  percys perspective because we both were the ones from royalty i had a goal  matt they were asked were going to present you before the people of emon as the celebration and  thanks for you helping us through this difficult time how would you like to be announced and it  was that moment of give us a we need to talk  travis it was pike scanlan and grog were the ones who were like thats a 
none	 good name well  keep it that way  taliesin and it was the two of us who were going absolutely fucking not  liam there is a little bit of a historical record of it though because there is that video  floating around of you breaking the news to us and your question after he finishes telling his story  is do we have to change our name from the shits and you have travis from off going  no deal no deal  matt yeah that mightve been right around that same time when all that went 
none	 down  brian thats hilarious matt question from tiamatzx what ultimately made clarahta turn on  the party  marisha clarahta  brian im joking remember earlier when i asked for the correct pronunciation so that i could do  the opposite what ultimately made clarota turn on the party was it already planned or was there a  chance he wouldnt only for his free will to be overridden by the elder brain  matt it wouldve had to have been a lot of work to try and appeal to clarota and convince him that  his separation from 
none	 the elder brain and his people is a permanent thing and now he could accept new  society new friends but that wouldve taken a lot of role play  laura hes like hugh in star trek from the borg i loved hugh  matt kind of i guess you could say but it wouldve taken a lot it was possible but because  at the time it was well hell help us and then push along for him it was just survival i mean  him even allying with you guys was purely out of your initial social confrontation 
none	 with him and  being like whoa were okay were not going to hurt you and hes like okay i can survive  with these guys i will convince them im a friend they will take me to where i want to go  and maybe if i free my people from this influence and free the elder brain from the influence of  kvarn theyll take me back  liam and youve got to imagine being linked into that elder brain system probably feels real good  matt oh yeah well an alhoon which is an illithid who has 
none	 arcane capabilities like that is  shunned forever and is told you can never be part of the elder brain connection again its like  being unplugged from your hive mind and so for him once he reconnected it was yeah there was  no coming back  brian its like when i left scientology taliesin  taliesin you left  liam you think when you left you think  laughter  brian oh man i cannot wait just to see the art of liams beard every time liam grows a beard  tumblr goes insane its the best i 
none	 spend way too many nights on there looking up all the fanfic of  liams beard taliesin question for you from joustingjose  laughter cheers  taliesin solid name  brian did percy worry about flashing his name knowing that the briarwoods were still around how  come the taldorei council didnt connect him with whitestone having heard that he is a de rolo  taliesin he was flashing again percy spent almost the entire game in the midst of an intense  nervous breakdown and he was specifically flashing his name almost like running around  saying im superman 
none	 looking for lex luthor so he was kind of trying to put feelers out there  to let people know who he was and what was happening whitestone i feel like they knew  that he came from whitestone i just felt that news of what had happened in whitestone hadnt  really processed through the kingdom  matt yeah everything that happened to the de rolos was kept close internally information got  out about the briarwoods currently running the space there was that the de rolos got very ill  the family all died off and these friends 
none	 came to power to continue their legacy and that was the  story that was suffused throughout taldorei beyond the citys limits so whenever they heard  de rolo either they think well hes crazy or maybe hes a relative but they werent very  politically connected  taliesin they wouldnt even necessarily know that who knows the name of the royal family of  nova scotia unless you need to  brian well sam does right its the berkin the berchins  sam scotians  brian the scotians ah yes  taliesin the new england scotians  sam daryl 
none	 and hannah scotian  marisha wait daryl and hannah  brian thats what he said  taliesin daryl and hannah thats pretty fantastic  liam just a skosh  taliesin yeah it was intentional and he was fine whether people believed it or not it was  more for him than it was for anybody else just to build himself up into this notion of a superhero  brian yeah absolutely and it worked  taliesin too well  brian too well yeah ashley stay awake with an answer  laughter  brian thank you for joining us right after 
none	 a very long day working on abcs blindside see that  every sunday at 2 pm on cbs make sure to watch that show ashley this question comes from  vexmeupbeforeyougogo  laughter singing along  brian i dont think you ever went into detail about what pike had been doing on her time off  just that she was on the seas can you elaborate on that for us  ashley oh boy well i knew that after i guess when we found out that when we were going to  start streaming the show and after pike had 
none	 died in our home games i had talked to everybody about  wanting to have pike be a little bit stronger and get a little bit more strength so when she was in  battle she could fight and offer a little bit more to the fight than just healing which is still  important so i think this is a roundabout answer but i think i wanted her to spend some time at sea and  on the broken howl and on a boat just basically doing simple boat work getting her strength  brian maybe some of you 
none	 guys know this but ashley lived on a boat for a while as a kid so  she knows her way around a boat too  marisha i didnt know that  brian yeah they lived on a boat for a little bit out in the marina she knows how to tie a  couple different windsor knots i dont  laughter  taliesin can you do a monkeys fist thats my favorite knot  brian im terrified of water im not allowed to go anywhere near the boats  taliesin you sprout more brians if you get wet is 
none	 that it  brian i wish set up a franchise take over then host all the aftershows ashley was there more  you wanted to add to that or do you feel  ashley thats pretty much it honestly it was one of those things where when we knew we were  going to be on the stream i was like okay this was what i wanted to have done on my time off and  because of my background on boats i was like lets make her a little bit of a sailor but  honestly i dont think 
none	 she had a very exciting life on the boat other than getting pretty  swole  laura howd you get the scar though you had a scar on the boat  sam yeah the scar  ashley was the scar from that time  laura yeah  ashley i thought id already had it  laura no  sam also didnt you fall in love with some dude on the boat  ashley no  sam oh  marisha she fell in love before and then went on the boat  liam next question  sam i didnt know that 
none	 get to the good stuff forget the boat stuff brian get to the love  stuff  brian were going to get there were going to get there i dont want the people will tune out  the second they get those answers so were going to tease them a little bit because thats why  people came here laura question for you from frankelstein constantly percy had to craft  more bullets but never did we see vex fletch arrows or go out and buy them why was that was  it just an assumedbetweenepisodes thing and if so 
none	 why not the same for percy  laura no that happened before the stream we just had  matt well two reasons on this one bullets dont exist in this world really outside of  percival and eventually some elements so you have to make them theres no other way to get  them whereas arrows you can buy them anywhere but even before the stream happened once you guys  got hold of a bag of holding you went and bought i think it was a thousand arrows and  just threw them in the bag  and at 
none	 that point i was like all right dont worry about it were fine  laura i think towards the end of the campaign you were like you may be running low on arrows  matt yeah  laura what  matt but yeah at that point they were so cheap and you guys had enough money in the bank that it  was like ill just not have to worry about this ever again  brian liam you touched on this earlier but shardee asks youve said before that the first  time vax realized he had feelings for keyleth 
none	 was during a moment in the underdark what was that  moment  liam well i dont really know the ball might have started rolling from that whisper i think  thats probably likely but i dont know where it happened i do remember whats going on laura  sam shes picking your nose  liam exaggerated sneeze  laughter  liam i do remember the months though playing the game and having that secret it was a home  game it was a secret i wasnt thinking of telegraphing it or leaving breadcrumbs or tipping  anybody off and 
none	 i didnt know if i was going to admit anything so i thought well ill just do  the little things that im doing here quietly and then either someday spill it or not and i  wasnt going to let anything out as soon as i did but when that thing with the briarwoods happened  i thought he was gone so i was like well hes dying so im going to let it out here oh hes  not dead uh sucks in a breath and ill pull it back in  marisha plus you know kash kind 
none	 of beat you to the punch a little bit  laura yeah he did  liam sure and again still had all that stuff brewing in my head for months after the kash kiss  and didnt want to show my hand  taliesin kash kiss  sam good reality show  brian supposed to be cash cab yeah  matt announcer voice season three of kash kiss on tlc  laughter  brian you might have just gotten your job as the narrator  matt oh god yes  brian travis question for you from mispronounces myrnorunshot whatever we 
none	 never  heard about grogs mother did he know her at all is she dead or alive  travis oh grog has no idea yeah i mean grogs idea of family i think growing up was just his  father stonejaw strongjaw  laughter  travis and like the herd the herd was the family as a whole and in my mind the herd of  storms was just kinda like free love man you just hook up with who you hook up with and then  you get kids and then you just teach them how to fight and 
none	 send them out into the wilderness and  they eat a deer with their bare hands and then you just move on to tuesday yeah he just never  really i dont think he ever really figured out who mom was and i dont think it was until he met  pike and everything and understood what a loving nurturing caring family was about that didnt  involve knuckles in your face that he might have even started to wonder hey who gave birth to  me and why did i never have a nurturer it never really occurred to 
none	 him  brian yeah interesting  ashley i forgot that was your dads name  laughter  ashley stonejaw strongjaw  travis to be fair i didnt make that did you make that did i i did make that name up  matt and sam you made it up  travis yeah thats right  marisha but i think it was before you had a last name right  matt no because he had a last name but i think when he made up the name of his dad they werent  using last names a lot in the game 
none	 he said it once at the beginning and it never came up for a  long time and so then stonejaw came out and eventually the two points connected and marvelous  times were had  laughter  travis yeah thats right on course  liam and we had to go deal with stonejaw  travis thats right you dealt with him when i wasnt there thats right  laura yeah we had to deal with  travis thanks for that he was a bitch  laughter  brian thanks for that help all those years ago matt something that 
none	 a lot of people wanted to  know from shandraa who was the anonymous person who took out the contract on the rakshasa  matt oh interesting that would have been i believe one of the members of the arcana  pansophical which member was it  travis i dont know what he just said  marisha that was most definitely a thing in our game that definitely was a thing  laughter  matt ive mentioned it a couple of times but the only person youve really dealt with from the  arcana  laura was the guy with 
none	 the purple hair right was he arcana pansophical  marisha yeah weve dealt with a few people from it  matt yeah well alluras a member  all oh yeah  laura obviously laughs  matt so was drake thunderbrand and a few other people but it was one of the members there and  the idea was they were working on developing some sort of a portal that connected to the hells and  they needed demon parts and theyd found there was a rakshasa that was in the space of the area and  was kind of a 
none	 twofer deal weed it out and also harvest parts from it that i could use as part of  this ritual not really understanding or caring that whoever killed it would be locked into a  cycle of revenge with whoever it was but thats why you pay people to do it for you because now  the vengeance isnt on you  brian absolutely  matt oh mages  taliesin money well spent  brian i have to say we are going back not just a long ways in time but a long ways in the journey  of 
none	 these characters and im surprised at how well everyones doing with remembering a lot of this  stuff  matt so are we  brian i didnt want to send everybody the questions beforehand because you know the fcc  and weve all seen quiz show popular 1994 film directed by robert redford  now matt you brought up allura a second ago mishapmaster13 says when kima was introduced was  the relationship with allura already planned out or did that evolve in response to the party and  the community  matt no that was part of the characters 
town	 plan to develop them as far as a past history i didnt  know if it was going to become a reconciliation or like we once had a fling but now were just  friends doing our own thing and the first time you guys even heard of kima was maybe the second  session when you were looking for grog in westruun and back then i was like she would have  had this past history with this mage character ill introduce down the road during the campaign  but when i developed the whole underdark arc i was 
none	 like okay theyre still good friends they still  care about each other even though their lives are separate and then that reunion was what  resparked it you guys retrieving kima and the idea of losing one another on her pilgrimage was  what began to rekindle that process for the two of them  brian did you have any idea that those two characters would become as beloved as they have  been to the fan base  matt no i had no idea and once again you dont know what to expect what magical combinations of  
none	 characters and people make for good storytelling and what people will cling onto and they became  as important to a lot of other people as they were to me as it progressed i didnt expect them to  be so impactful to me either you know allura eventually became as we all realized a  selfinsertion into the story at times and yeah it was cool to just watch it evolve  brian yeah  liam gosh i mean two shopkeeps are beloved on this show gilmore and victor  brian yeah thats true  laura good ol victor 
none	  laughter  brian marisha  marisha yes  brian question about keyleths antlers before i get to that did you ever have any idea that that  would be such a thing that that would become such an iconic sort of  marisha no not at all  brian well smokeontheraze wants to know keyleth has had the antlers since day once and  never took them off sometimes getting defensive about them is there a story behind the antlers  marisha she had a circlet in our home game she had a circlet that i kind of looped 
none	 into was one  of the last relics from her mom and her ashari tribe that she took with us or with her you  get what im saying  and then kit was the one who drew it as the antlers i told kit i was like shes got a dope  circlet and that was about all i told kit and then it came back with antlers and i was like  oh i love this  laura yeah so much of the original characterizations came from kit like the  feathers that wasnt me that was her 
none	  brian oh interesting  laura all these little things that ended up becoming so  brian iconic  laura yeah with our characters  liam yeah a lot of little things came up just by chance or from art and then we wove them  backwards in time into the story so much happens by accident and thats the magic of the game  brian taliesin did percy have glasses in your mind or was that  taliesin uh yes yes he did although they werent quite as complicated as when kit came out  with the fourlens that 
none	 was like oh wow thats wonderfully complicated and impractical i love it  laughter  brian makes for such cool cosplay though and art matt  matt yes  brian ickulus wants to know i believe you mentioned that the thunderbrands were supposed to  end up as allies or a bigger part of the story if the initial encounter had gone differently what  did we end up missing there  matt laughs yeah the thunderbrands i designed to be kind of an ally in the journey into the  underdark the idea is when you converse with them 
none	 there is a story with a family member who is  lost in the underdark and if you guys had brought it up and discussed with them like were going down  there its dangerous can you be of any aid they would either provide some equipment and possibly  send somebody along with you who would be kind of a guide into the underdark one of the  thunderbrand mages  laura oh man  travis liam would have probably killed that  laughter  liam no no that lost relative went on to be the nothic that i 
none	 shanked underground  laughter  matt yeah you eventually found the necklace that was part of that thread which was eventually  returned to house thunderbrand but yeah instead of that you guys and tiberius and once you guys  walked out to the front of the house and attacked their wards with spells and then got in their  face at the door and then scanlan turned invisible and snuck inside for no reason and  laughter  travis yeah thats right  laura that was the first time you went invisible  travis you went invisible and we 
none	 were like screams  matt so that thread didnt continue laughs  brian yeah  laura wow  matt but yeah it would have been just like an alliance that would have led to some possible  bonuses in equipment options and possibly an ally to guide you through the underdark but  laura damn  marisha whoops  laura i wonder how many times weve fucked that up like different relationships huh  travis every week  taliesin every week  matt laughs  laura a lot of times  brian every single time  taliesin every week is 
none	 a friend we never will make  liam next campaign will be better next campaign will be better  others sure laughter  travis well get it all right  brian were going to be saying that for the next couple of weeks matt  liam optimized our combat decisions will be optimized  sam yep  matt sure  laura next campaign still a bunch of dicks  brian streamlined  marisha yeah  brian after we roll initiative everybody knows what they want to do matt payattention007  asks  laughter  brian how did a sphinx come 
none	 to be hidden beneath vasselheim  matt thats an interesting point so ioun and the knowing mistress and the following there is a  belief that knowledge and the dissemination of knowledge is of paramount importance to elevate  and teach people about history about lore about truth and when she was wounded and when her  following was largely culled during the calamity and then shortly after the divergence they had to  go into hiding so the followers of ioun outside of the cobalt reserve which are like the most  prominent members of them but they are 
none	 well protected by the governments including osysa  they had to go into hiding and in doing so kind of i imagine almost like those truth groups  that find secret information and then disseminate it to the press this is the truth about this and  kind of reveal and whistleblow certain things thats kind of how a lot of iouns followers have  to work in society because if they reveal themselves there are a lot of darker elements that  will hunt them down and try and destroy them followers of tharizdun the chained oblivion and  
none	 other individuals that want to see this wounded god eventually taken away so osysa has long been  an agent of iouns will and they needed a bastion of that in vasselheim and so the creation of the  slayers take was all a cover in a way of ingraining that within vasselheim society and  osysa needs to stay hidden to be that heart of the information network for the followers of ioun in  that part of the countryside of issylra  brian can you believe he holds all this in his head  murmured agreement  travis 
none	 that just blows my mind  brian watching traviss face im like yeah thats how i feel thats how i feel  laughter  brian last question for this arc and then were going to move on matt from telepickups where  was the other horn of orcus and could the players have found it  travis good question  laura wait can we know that we cant know that  matt actually you shouldnt know that because its still in the world  laura ah  brian oh wow  matt there might be some questions that i cant 
none	 answer because they might and im not saying  they will pertain to the next campaign but they might the other horn of orcus does exist in the  world as there are a number of other artifacts and vestiges that  laura its underneath dalens closet  matt yeah its right in the sand there its two feet deep some kids going to find it on  vacation  laughter  marisha just need a metal detector beep beep  brian yeah just a retired guy with a metal detector at the end of each arc were going to 
none	  give some critrolestats that cover the whole campaign given to us by our friends at  critrolestats up first were going to talk about rolls the total rolls for the campaign 10819  matt thats crazy  marisha the fact that they counted them how  brian and they all have real jobs and real lives its not like theyre just sitting at home doing  all this theyre just really smart total nat 20s including dotys matt crit 548  travis damn  brian nat 20s yeah taliesin only cheated on a few  taliesin only a few 
none	  brian total nat ones do you think its higher or lower than nat 20s  laura lower  sam way lower because some of us  laura we have advantage and luck  brian 497 versus 548 its really close what was that liam  liam you get to reroll things what was it burning a grit or something  matt he gives himself advantage on attack rolls  liam thats still rolls  marisha he eventually critted on a 19  matt you did have indomitable where you can reroll saving throws as well  liam so luck 
none	 is allpurpose but that was like a morelimited version of  brian per player lets look at the most nat 20s oh no top two vax 107 percy 104 beat you by  a few most nat ones vex 76  laura oh shit really  travis thats what you get for having all of those fucking dice time to cull the herd  brian followed not too far behind by her delicious brother with 61 yes  liam they walk alike they talk alike  marisha you guys are rolling a lot more too because you have three attacks 
none	 right or do you  have two attacks  all attack attack attack attack attack  laura dagger dagger dagger dagger  brian that is all the time we have for the kraghammervasselheim arc we will now move onto a  big fanfavorite arc of the show episodes 24 through 38 this arc saw our heroes dealing with a  darker more sinister and more personal beings than theyd ever faced before the briarwoods  musical crescendo  brian all right briarwoods lets get into it  taliesin you made it weird man  brian were going to discuss the 
none	 briarwoods arc now  travis fill in the story from what happened before that  brian no nope let them wonder matt question from saraheliz135 what was seeker asums plan to  investigate the briarwoods before vax threw a wrench into it  matt he was trying to find some sort of proof that they perhaps didnt have the political power  for the promises they were making to build the bridge between the shearing channel and  wildemount the whole ordeal of the dinner was this meeting of the strange mysterious and somewhat  secluded whitestone society and the 
none	 council of emon in hopes to bridge this gap with the  briarwoods who represented interests from whitestone they seemed to have connections and  boasted a lot of knowledge of whitestone political connections asum was reading something  off about them he was trying to seek some element of proving or catching them in a lie about them being  able to do so and as such save the council from anything negative i dont think he really knew  how deep it went obviously he didnt trust that their politics were in line  brian interesting threw a 
none	 wrench in it  liam oh well  brian oh well  liam great episodes  brian vaxs got to vax travis question from mike garcia how close were you to murdering liam  when you destroyed the pencil how close was grog to doing something more regrettable to vax cask  of ale destroyed close  travis wow well mike that was a pretty hot moment shaving ole groggys halfbeard while he  was asleep that was a new level the mechanical pencil bends to rage really easily that kicked  off months of me trying to get you 
none	 back actually  liam but it wasnt the beginning it was a midpoint  travis it was a new echelon a new world order had started thats when i realized how damn  slippery you are because i could never get my damn hands on you to do some shit i kept trying to pants  him or trip him or whatever but i kept failing it was pretty gnarly  brian liam what was that like on your side of things  liam i dont think i realized in the game how furious travis was  travis could you 
none	 not feel the 100 degrees kelvin pouring off of my person  brian you couldnt feel the leg violently shaking under the table as all the violence went to that leg  taliesin trucks going by all the time  liam it was magical i figured it would just come back hed already fucked with my shit plenty of  times i thought it was just tit for tat i was wrong  brian matt question from settiai just who was the woman in her late 40searly 50s that percy saw  with his nat 20 roll in the sun 
none	 tree the one with the wolves outside whitestone  matt that was a hunter that was a denizen of whitestone who was out hunting with the wolves at  night if they had seen you it could have been either an opportunity for you to learn things  about the city and its current state as opposed to wandering in and figuring it out as it happens  or if it went poorly someone who could try and escape and go back and relay information to the  briarwoods in hopes of not being killed or getting some possible favor 
none	 with the overlords out of  fear they werent a follower or a toady they were just a person who lived there and wanted to  survive and would have done so if they didnt feel you could help them  brian interesting i know  laura that womans haunted me for a while actually i think about that one a lot  travis really  laura yeah  brian is she wreaking havoc in your guest bathroom and doing all kinds of stuff in your  house liam zombiecaddies has a question for you i actually cried when the 
none	 briarwoods killed  vax with his last thoughts going through his head being his friends and kiki what was your  inspiration for that moment  liam for making that happen i thought i was out just like i thought i was out in the raven queens  tomb there were things that i wanted the game because we were playing it so often it was already  evolving heavily i hadnt worked up the gumption to say anything in the story to keyleth so i was  like im getting it out here also at that point it was 
none	 starting but vaxs world was still 98 his  sister i dont know it was just a chance to vomit out my inner monologue before exiting the  game i thought  brian yeah you did a great job  sam good vomiting  laura great vomit  brian it says that on his cv professional vomiter question from argentumlupine for sam  sam thank you for coming  sam hi guys i was late  brian hes so close to ash in my eyeline that every time i go to ask him a question i just want  to 
none	 look at her  taliesin we all have that problem  ashley hey  brian i like to see her on a screen hey sam what tipped you off that percys gun needed to be  destroyed  sam because he did crazy shit with it all the time and werent you marking things off the gun at  that point  taliesin yeah but  sam thats weird scanlan is not very perceptive not very wise so it took a long time to realize  that something was wrong with it i think matt was there a roll associated 
none	 did i ever insight it  or something  matt there may have been and i dont recall the specifics of that  taliesin there was a roll to get me to give it to you which i was not pleased about  marisha wait did he use friends  sam i did  matt im pretty sure you figured that out on your own i dont think i made you roll to figure that  information  sam it was pretty apparent i sat next to taliesin for most of the campaign so i feel like  i saw 
none	 him more but i guess i didnt  liam theres also no mistaking taliesinpercys utter shock and dismay at that happening it was  not manufactured it was real  taliesin i was not happy dont do this please dont do this  sam i did not think that he would be upset with me at all i thought i was doing him a big favor  getting rid of the bad thing and hed be like aw thanks scanlan no he hated that  marisha he would have done that himself way sooner  taliesin built it in a 
none	 fucking barn two mystical elements involved nope nothing  laura how much did that gun cost  taliesin it was priceless and i never managed to build another one  laura i know you didnt you were magic weaponless the whole rest of the game  taliesin because it was impossible to recreate  sam i just thought it was a good gun i did not know it had any of those things associated with it  taliesin so pristine two magical elements welded into oh lord  marisha and you were going for the trifecta yeah you were going 
none	 for it  liam that tesseract thing you can make  another one of those right  laughter  taliesin but it was cursed apparently so there was that  marisha would there have been any other way to break him from that  matt the only way to break it would have been to physically kill orthax go to where orthax would  reform in the abyss and then destroy him there or destroy the implement in which the curse had bound  him in so honestly it was the better choice  taliesin orthax is still out there 
none	 though  matt from what you know yeah  taliesin yeah cool all right  brian matt are you keeping track of some of this stuff from the campaign since the new campaign is  going to be set in the future of the current world are you having to keep notes of whatifs  and are you trying not to tie the two too closely together  matt well both well now yes i dont want the new campaign to tie too strongly to this campaign  i want it to be its own thing i want the story 
town	 to be something wholly unique and new and not feel  like its living in the shadow of or trying to connect directly to the last game its a very  different part of the world there will be choices that were made and things you guys did in this  campaign that have affected the world and will effect elements down the road per se but i dont  want it to be a continuation directly i want it to feel new and different so im keeping track of  it all for my own internal consistency and for 
none	 answering questions for people who are playing  their own games in taldorei and beyond but thats my idea  brian okay that makes sense matt actually if you could arthur ornelas asks could we get a  little insight into sylas and delilah and the life choices they made that led to vecna how much of  that was tals notes and how much was your brain  matt taliesin you just told me the briarwoods came and murdered your family  taliesin i tried to hand you nothing i wouldnt have known everything i gave you about whitestone 
none	  was all i remember you specifically going saying like if you have anything else to add do it now  matt yep  taliesin yeah i didnt know anything about them so i didnt write anything about them  matt which i think is a great tool for players when youre creating character backstories write  in as much as your character knows because it gives the dm room to create in that space and  surprise you and you know create things behind the scenes for them its like in this  perspective with the briarwoods id created 
none	 a scenario where they were not like super powerful  lord and lady in the dwendalian empire but they had some renown some power some connections and  they existed a comfortable life out there she was a lesser mage working with an academy out there  and her husband had gotten sick the disease that had begun to take him they couldnt find a cure  for so she went out to try and find a way of curing it trying to find somebody who could  concoct a means of doing so and did and returned too late 
none	 and he had passed she was so  distraught by it that she began to just delve into her meditation delving into her magics trying to  find something to stop him just screamed into the astral sea her fury and a voice whispered back  and it said i can help you and that was vecna she didnt know that at the time but these  whispers started to come to her in her dreams and began to give her elements of information and in  her grief she began to just follow them blindly and eventually it led 
dung	 her to one of vecnas old  laboratories with an old servant of his that forgot his name for ages hes so old that he  doesnt know his name just kind of this undead servant this powerful creature that watches over  it and thats where she found through the whispers the rites of vampirism and he was  like i can give you the secret to bring your love back to life but then you owe me youre  mine and so she said whatever it takes the resurrection of sylas as a vampire was a fraction  
none	 of vecnas power that tied them to him  laura that makes them even cooler  travis we shouldnt have killed them  laura no  matt however because of her toying with necromancy which is outlawed in the dwendalian  empire and people were seeing her acting weird she was pursued discovered to have been toying  with necromancy and there was a hunt out for them both they were both arrested they got away and  there was a hunt to find them and have them executed and so they fled the dwendalian empire  went to the 
town	 menagerie coast which is where port damali is which is kind of like the last major  port town on the way western to taldorei and that was where they ran into ripley and ripley  had her own thing she was fleeing from and they both were like hey were both fugitives from the  dwendalian empire with really no direction lets work together and thats where they had heard  about this place of whitestone and they began to talk and get in with the family and began to make  these trips from port damali to whitestone 
none	 to build a relationship with them to take their  guard down made some alliances there turned some people who worked in the castle with this whole  plan of just completely gutting this family that had for the most part for their own intention  cut themselves off from the rest of the world politically so no one would really know or care if  they went missing or died  liam not gonna lie i wouldnt mind playing in their campaign  taliesin weird note on the briarwoods also in my head when i wrote them for myself 
none	 i gave them  no supernatural elements whatsoever in my head but i was reminded of a married couple from new  orleans theres an old ghost story in new orleans that they do on the haunted house tour of  a house that had a fire and when the fire brigade went in they went upstairs and they just found  disastrously mutilated bodies of people who were obviously kept alive for way t were still alive  like a torture chamber of just awful and weird and as they were trying to figure this out the  rich 
none	 couple just got into a coach with their stuff and left and were never seen or heard from again  they were just out and i find it interesting that they kind of had a similar like later  were out of here  matt yep thats kind of how they done it thats funny i didnt know that  taliesin oh yeah ill find the story its a really big new orleans ghost story  brian my parents had a similar story  taliesin explains a lot  brian it does laura gloriarokicki would like to know did vex 
none	 have feelings for percy at this  time and how did watching this darkness bloom in him affect her  laura oh yeah the darling take the mask off that was definitely starting around then i dont  know i think it attracted her to him more how fucked up is that  laughter  brian got a nice fist in the air for that one  laura yeah sorry  marisha was it like a ooh hes broken i can fix him  laura i can help him no its just like edgy  laughter  marisha amazing  
none	 brian thoughts  taliesin he didnt know the voice in his head was real he literally thought it was he was in the  midst again it was a very nervousbreakdowny reality for him his hair went shock white he  woke up on a boat in shock for months and just didnt talk to people until he did and yeah the  dream he thought was just  laura i mean smoke came out of his body  taliesin well that was the first time that it ever happened though thats the thing is he had  had some 
dung	 weird dreams and was like im going to build this weird thing but it had not connected  that that was actually a real thing at all until that point it had just been like maybe im just  having a really bad time  liam also can anybody correct me if im wrong i dont remember any whiff of any of that from the  home game at all it just percolated under the surface until we started the show  matt even the story that taliesin gave me was just he had a dream where some dark entity 
none	 showed  him how to make a gun and that was it and the way i developed it was orthax was not going to  begin to manifest itself until the moment of possible vengeance arose the minute that he  allowed that fury to see someone who he intended to kill before him as part of his list that was  when the demon would begin to manifest itself so it didnt until the briarwood arc  taliesin oh yeah no it was entirely possible from what i handed i very specifically was like  if you decide that 
none	 that isnt anything it doesnt have to be anything it could have just been had  a weird dream one day woke up and built something awful  brian yeah you seem not too attached to some ideas i know youve mentioned that before on the  show where theres some stuff where you leave it to matts discretion do you guys all feel that  way i know you get uncomfortable when i say this but because matt is like a one or two star dm out  of ten or whatever do you find that its easier to 
none	 trust him with stuff does that make sense  laura well thats half the fun is going halfway with it and letting him take the rest because you  dont want to know all the mysteries you know the fun is discovering it  brian and hes going to also spin it into a beautiful story with a bunch of different layers  and things too as were learning  matt it gives me the opportunity and like anybody out there who has dmed a game can agree with me  brian dont look at me  matt gives the 
none	 opportunity for the dm to play  laughter  matt gives the opportunity to collaborate on the backstory element too and surprise the  players thats the thing its really cool as a player to play through a game and not have all the  answers to your own story and then to have things surprise you and change your perspective and then  it becomes more intriguing to you as a player so the more you outline the more you detail  specifically the elements of your history as a character the less you have to look forward to 
none	  to surprise you down the line in my opinion  brian you guys have to be so excited about the prospect of sort of hitting the etchasketch and  starting again with that  sam its going to be so exciting nervewracking the first session is going to just be us  liam who are you who am i  sam yeah like why is travis talking like that  laughter  taliesin swedish chef voice  travis highpitched voice i will speak with this  laura see hes joked about this multiple times i think it might actually 
none	 be honest  travis highpitched voice hiya  brian 115 more episodes of travis talking like that marisha question for you from  blangadager  laura thats awesome  brian i know its great considering where vox machina was at during this time point had vox  machina continued to kill with extreme violence without concern of moral consequence would  keyleth have left the party  marisha that is such an extreme way of putting exactly what they were doing its very accurate  she was i had a weird crisis with keyleth for a little bit for a 
none	 while i was like i cant stay  what i am i doing here your friends will be the first people to drag you down theyre bad  influences  matt i remember you talking to me about that we were discussing what would happen if you decided  to go that route we were like well keyleth just leaves and you make a new character and maybe  shell come back maybe she wont  marisha and also at that time i think it was about that time i kept repeating i have to  continue my aramente i 
none	 feel like im just dicking around at this point i still have work to do i  got to go you were also going through a character there were a few character crises  liam im real glad you didnt make a new character  marisha yeah me too i mean keyleth was pretty boss there at the end i almost left  laura pretty freaking boss  marisha respect the antlers laughing practically goldfish  brian matt this is a really interesting question from theoodsigma what would have happened if  they had left ripley in the cell  
none	 matt ripley probably would have either found a way to escape or once the briarwoods were freed you  would have to go back down to deal with that but the minute she had any chance of escape she would  have or probably try and work her way into your wiles if she was purely unable to escape the  prison and you knew who she was and you had defeated the briarwoods and whitestone was yours  once more and you just had her prostrate in a cell with no weapons and you intending to murder her  
none	 she would have done everything in her power to be as sly and convincing that she was as used as anyone  else as cassandra was and to get in your good graces and the first chance she had to abscond  with any of your technology gone  brian wow really  laura what a bitch  taliesin i imagine her as the evil version of the librarian character from the mummy  matt thats a good point of reference  taliesin the psychotic joker version of that character  matt yeah very much so definitely  brian the 
dung	 brendan fraser mummy franchise or the newly minted now matt followup question for  you watched it on a plane as god intended this is from maxvsthegames what happened with  the bodies of the de rolo family were they buried or did vox machina end up fighting their skeletons  in the streets of whitestone  matt no to get a little dark here no the briarwoods in order to cement their rule they  needed to instill absolute fear of fleeing or any sort of rebellion so you dont just murder the  family you leave them in 
none	 public as a sign so those bodies you saw hanging from the sun tree  werent the first to hang from that tree  taliesin i had that vibe  matt in fact i never got to tell you because it never came up and nobody would have told you at that time but  when you saw the vox machina hanging from the sun tree those were almost the exact same arrangement  as percys family were after whitestone  taliesin i assumed i like the way you think  liam can you imagine percy 30 years in the 
none	 future being an old happy fart and just going out to the  window and seeing beautiful whitestone beautiful tree and just the invisible imagination of that  taliesin oh yeah never gone  travis what the fuck man the power of christ compels you get out of here  taliesin its a very bloodladen family to begin with at some point ill write a little bit of  the stuff ive scribbled down its just one more ghost story for that bloody castle theres a  lot of them its highly appropriate for whitestone  brian droll me away 
none	 baby hey ashley cure our darkness with a 9thlevel  marisha i thought that was the handle at first  brian no i wish the handle is much better and its serpouncealot is pikes ability to astral  project across great distances to help her friends a sign that she is special to sarenrae  ashley highpitched um  laughter  sam or just a sign that you live in new york for most of the year  ashley i would like to think that thats the reason why but i believe its because i live  across the country 
none	 so i know matt found a way around that which im so thankful that he did  and here i am still an astral projection  brian but at least youre in high definition  ashley a highdef astral project  liam she brought sarenraes faith back to the continent didnt she  matt she was one of the main figures that began to restore the knowledge of the experience  brian okay okay i cant not say it when i hear it its one of those things when i hear it i  say it matt frostdragon85 wants to 
none	 know what would have happened if lady briarwoods ritual  succeeded  matt it did she succeeded the ritual but she didnt know what she was looking for like all  things piecemeal with vecna she was told to prepare all these things to succeed and when it  succeeded it triggered the siphon which became this tiny dot that did nothing from her  perspective and so she went from all right this grand ceremony to thats it we failed it was  too early they were pushed to do it and they were already afraid it wouldnt have 
none	 functioned  but the idea was they succeeded entirely and if you guys had prodded it enough over time began to  delve into the research and make that a big point you might have discovered that it was a successful  ritual but the fact that you didnt made it more fun for me to play in the background anyway as  far as delilah was concerned it failed but when she was killed the first time and then recovered  in her clone body and began to reconnect with the whispers of vecna vecna was like no you 
none	 did  good and now to move onto the next one now to prepare for the next siphon to be triggered and  so that was the background progression of her arc while you guys were battling the conclave and  everything  brian it stresses me out that its so layered and involved because you guys have to face a whole  other campaign and hes even better now than he was at coming up with this stuff im just trying  to make you guys nervous and scared travis lizlevelup wants to know percy gave grog craven  
none	 edge in this arc episode 36 when you first got given the card what did you expect from the  sword did you have a what have i done moment when you read the card fully  travis oh man i didnt even know what a sentient weapon was i had never even heard of  that he just described it as some big gorgeous greatsword and i was like i can wield that  ill take it and percys reaction of reading the first few lines of the card and showing a little  dismay having just been cured 
none	 of his current curse i was like give it to me itll be fine so when matt  started talking it was a total shock reading it was only half of the story what did we have to  do identify or we had to do something else  matt you had to attune to it to reveal it all or identify it in advance  travis yeah the rest of that card is super important thats a big part of it so i think he  was enjoying this new friend that talked to him and helped him shishkebab 
none	 people really well  brian turned out great talk about no strings attached matt question from jessie lewis how  did you intend for vox machina to get out of the acid chamber  matt i didnt no there were a number of ways they could have attempted to focus all their  strength towards the residuum wall that was blocking them off they could have tried to block  up or destroy the chutes in which the acid was being delivered to the chamber and bought some  time i believe the way you got to the button  
none	 liam i used the cloak of the mountebank  matt yeah the mountebank to teleport through there was a way of opening the door but it was  elsewhere in the chamber there was a possibility of waiting for the briarwoods to leave and then  fiddle with the buttons but kind of jumped the gun on that one  liam yeah i thought i was hitting the door open button  matt no you were not but that once again wonderful dd moment  liam yeah that was a rug yank moment  marisha how did we end up 
none	 getting out of that  matt you didnt the rest of the campaign is a dream  brian its kind of like that tv show about the plane crash and the island sam cast true  resurrection on your career with an answer for this person oh its also blangadanger back for  you had scanlan learned of his daughter before kaylie confronted him what would he have done  differently  sam say that again i wasnt listening as is frequent with this show  brian people talk had scanlan learned of his daughter before kaylie confronted him what 
town	 would  he have done differently  sam not try to get with her  laughter  brian thats all the time we have for tonight  sam i dont know probably would have run away from that information thats scary information  and not seeing her in the flesh if he had just heard you got a daughter out there shes  looking for you hed probably be like lets go to another town  brian i have a tendency to not ask a lot of questions when im drunk  liam dont try to get with her the 
none	 scanlan shorthalt story  brian and the problem is that if she resembled him he would be even more attracted to her  because she  sam i feel like that was part of the problem  brian that was part of the problem taliesin gornuk23 wants to know can you believe theres  23 of them who was the final unnamed barrel on the list meant for  liam reveal it  brian this is the episode where you can reveal everything  taliesin i think its going to be slightly disappointing it was not meant for him which 
none	 i  know a lot of people thought it was for himself it was his acknowledgement that the list was not  the end and his acknowledgement that the minute he started this that this was going to be an  unending cycle of awful and so that barrel was meant to be a fresh start for a brand new list  and it was going to be once you hit that it was theyre all dead its time to find the next six  people and this is who you are now i know ive said this a lot 
none	 and people hate it but i want to  make this clear the reason i give percy a lot of crap is because when he started building this  thing and going on a revenge run he was acutely aware of what he was doing there was no surprise  and the first time he saw a gun in the wild it wasnt oh no it was that went a little more  slowly than i expected he was expecting ripley to have guns he was expecting all of this to go  horribly wrong because he knew it would 
none	 and so he was like i really want to kill these six people  and im excited to help thousands of other people in my lifetime die this way as well its  worth it trade done and that was the line of i know what im becoming i know what im doing  and im doing it anyway even though its really dumb  laura he was a pretty bad guy  brian he was what does it say about you for falling in love with him laura question for you  from buzzrock1 how did vex get vaxs 
none	 snake belt back do you remember  laura how did his snake belt go missing in the first place  liam it went missing when i  travis threw it at the  laura oh i went and flirted with the guards i talked to matt about that  sam liam and taliesin classic  laura yeah i went and flirted with the guards and got it back for him  marisha was it one of those cases where you saw one of the guards wearing the belt and you were  like dude for real  laura i think 
none	 there was a lot of winking involved  matt yeah it was a lot of hey i lost this thing could you please go get it for me please  and he went well see  liam that physical belt buckle is sitting on my treasure shelf  laura i saw another snake belt this weekend and i almost got it for you i was like he doesnt  need another snake belt now its going to be another sort of thing it was a really cool snake  belt though if i hadnt gotten you the other one i 
none	 would have got you this one  brian we had a few questions about cassandra for this arc we only have time to get to two of them  but matt from tiliacordata if he had failed the saving throw would percy have been forced to  kill cassandra had you always planned for her name to appear on the gun  matt i had planned if they had encountered her yeah i guess i did always intend for her to  appear on the gun based on the encounters as they were going to reveal unless there was some 
none	 way  in which they met cassandra they had snuck into the castle and came across her room beforehand and  managed to break her of her cycle of mental abuse with the briarwoods possibly it could have been  averted but for the most part it was designed to be one of those crux moments where its a point of  showing percival how deep this terrible choice and deal he made can go  brian somebody had asked what would have happened to percy had he shot everyone on the list  including cassandra what would have happened 
none	 to percy  matt oh six more names would have appeared  taliesin thank you  matt yeah which is why i think its so interesting that you say that because i didnt  know that and the intent of orthaxs revenge curse is that its continuous once youve made  that deal you take those six names out well now theres six more people you have to kill and if  you dont have anybody you need vengeance for lets go find people  taliesin percy wouldnt have even blinked he would have been right into it  liam 
none	 what would have happened if he had blinked what if he had tried to fight that deal  matt that was when the will contrast comes the list is still there the creature is always there it just  means that if it lost the current battle it would bide its time and come back stronger again until  eventually he loses the will to resist  laura go scanlan  sam i knew all of that  laughter  brian marisha our final question for this arc is for you from raibdarkin it was during this time  that 
none	 keyleth made two of her most impressive moral stands the first refusing to have vox machina  send the young roc to whitestone and the other by refusing to let the skeletal army overrun it  is this where she began to realize she could be a leader  marisha oh no probably not 100 percent no no she was still suffering from crippling  selfloathing yeah just no she still didnt believe in herself and still was dealing with  insecurity issues it took her awhile i think keyleth still didnt fully believe it until she  was getting 
none	 that mantle put on her over in the final ceremony i remember one of the bigger  turning points of stepping up and making sure she was a leader was the kraken fight i put a lot of  responsibility on keyleth and conversely myself for not stepping up and forcing a better plan on  us it was my task that almost got everybody killed we almost tpked that one and we could  have done that way better and i think that was when she was like oh once again those moral  lessons of inaction someones got 
none	 to fucking herd cats  travis and we almost got rid of tary  laura so close  liam such a strong decisive leader moment at the end of that though when you chose to get out with  as many as you could and the way that you did it  brian so foreshadowing of later leadership qualities which probably were there the whole  time but needed to be fermented and you needed the experience and the trials  marisha i forgot about that that was probably the exact turning point that moment  brian anything else from 
none	 the briarwoods arc that you guys want to talk to matt about or ask or ask  each other  marisha i have a question had i not rolled a natural 20 when i stuck my hand into the ziggurat  anything under the natural 20 what would have happened to keyleth  laura and brian his eye twitched  matt a natural 20 was pretty close to what you needed or a high roll i think the dc was an 18  to try to resist the impact you saw what happened when they put anything through it that 
none	 would have  been keyleth she would have gone through taken a shit ton of damage and either died or if she  survived thrust out into the shadowfell seriously jacked up on the outskirts of thar  amphala and you would have found a lot earlier what the vecna tiein to the story was and it  would have changed a lot of the story at that point if keyleth had survived i cant recall the  exact amount of damage but the average was somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 to 150  damage  laura you didnt 
dung	 have that many hit points at that point  marisha no not at all  travis aint none of us coming in after you  marisha no one even knew i was down there everyone was asleep and i didnt even tell  anybody you would have woken up and keyleth would have been gone  taliesin that would have been dark and weird  marisha how crazy would it have been it if i would have come back like robin williams in jumanji and  come back 20 years later and im like the shit ive seen  laura 
none	 what would have been crazy is we would have gone to thar amphala and then we would have fought  you undead  matt few things would have been more fucked up in the game i thought about it afterward than  having the success of this arc and then your character out of curiosity dead and then me  having to tell you im sorry keyleths gone and they dont know where you are  sam we would have been like did we say something grog did you say something  laura maybe this is too much for her 
none	 i dont know  matt and if that was the case then whatever new character that would have come along would have  progressed from there and when you finally got into thar amphala there would have been an undead  keyleth probably under vecna  taliesin that would have been so fucked up  brian i would have been so into some undead keyleth art for sure speaking of damage our next  round of critrolestats for the vox machina campaign is about damage the party together has  dealt a total of 50074 damage the most damage taken 
none	 who do you think took the most damage  sam vax oh wait maybe grog  brian the answer is grog with 5646 damage taken who do you think dealt the most damage though  travis keyleth  brian okay keyleth is your guess anybody else  liam yeah also keyleth  sam pike  laura maybe vax  brian well youre correct the answer is grog most damage dealt 10038 my man thats right  laura and we dealt 50000 thats so much percentage of our damage dealt  brian damahge yeah stanima that concludes our round of questions 
none	 for the briarwoods arc lets  move on to discuss episodes 39 through 83 and the dangerous alliances questionable party decisions  the items of power and mystery that led our heroes into the path of the chroma conclave  musical crescendo  all right we will now discuss the chroma conclave  beginning with matt mercer question for you from hadley  diforti during the conclave attack did you plan who you would kill off for story purposes or did  you roll the dice on their fate  matt i decided what made more sense the sovereign i 
none	 wanted to die because i wanted it to  be a transition into the council the republic of emon and taldorei and i wanted it to be a  central figure that had previously become the highest ally you had attained to have them  slaughtered immediately would be one of those giant wind out of the sails youre on your own  type sensation i decided on that and i thought of which members of the council would be the most  brave and resolute and probably throw their lives away in trying to attack this unassailable force  
none	 that had just arrived so i decided on those based on what the narrative made sense for  brian interesting seems like a good choice liam question for you from commanderclay would  vax have left vox machina if the chroma conclave had not attacked  liam thats interesting im not sure i know the answer to that he definitely wouldnt have left  without his sister i think the challenge and the fun of it would have been having to come up with a  reason despite it was similar to your moment the way i thought of it 
none	 was im really going to  have to do some tapdancing to figure out why im still here i think he would have been conflicted  and dealing with it i guess eventually it would have reached a breaking point there was a lot of  butting heads at that time in the leadup too and i think part of it was off the stupid prank war i  dont know and i often get questions like what would have happened if this hadnt happened i  dont know thats the fun of this game  marisha would you have 
none	 ever gone with him would you have ever left with your bro  laura yeah if he talked me into it i wouldve left i wouldve fought him about it but if he  made that decision and he was going to go i wouldve gone with him  brian interesting sounds like family matt question for you why does everyone laugh when i  say something nice  taliesin its so surprising and out of character  brian matt coelkiking asks did vox machina bring the dragons down on emon because they messed  with the orbs or did 
none	 this event just happen to  coincide with that  matt no the event just happened to coincide the plan that the conclave was still intending to  happen it was still geared towards the conjunction set upon by the winters crest and  thordaks escape from the fire elemental plane this was all longplanned by raishan and the  council however because you had been noticed through the orbs it gave a face so now there was  an element of recognizing who you were these meddlers to a certain extent when you did arrive  when you did 
none	 confront certain members who may have been aware it also put you on raishans radar  very heavily which led to raishan finding information very quickly ascertaining your  location in whitestone once things had gotten a little rough with the conclave and trying to find  a strong position going forward  liam may i ask a followup question for matt was it always your plan from when we were at home to  get to that and playing every six weeks would we have gotten to that conclave attack this weekend  matt probably yeah it was my 
town	 plan when i introduced the orbs and i introduced krieg and  brimscythe that was all going to be a lead up to the attack of the conclave back then i intended  that to be an event down the road and that was the tease to it but going at the pace we were  playing at home we would have gotten to that by about now  brian yeah taliesin question from heather johnson what was percys plan to take out grog  in the workshop over the skull he seemed very sure of himself in a tight 
none	 space with a raging  goliath  taliesin my thoughts were several a i can give him disadvantage on every attack every round and  b i know what is in every one of those bottles and i had a working kiln i thought i had enough  stuff around there that i could have had him bathed in acid kneedeep in sodium and probably  set on fire pretty quickly and kept out of his reach and kept keeping back pushing back and  giving him as much disadvantage blinding him it would have been keeping lots of status 
none	 effects  travis see i heard a great comparison on el twitter which was the game of thrones fight  between the mountain and the sand viper staying on the outside and all of that stuff until i get a  hold of you and then i squish your head like a pumpkin  taliesin i was of the opinion i could probably ride that out a long while  liam i love freddie he is a darkly fascinating character i think grog would have turned him into  a skid mark  taliesin kept that skull away from you 
none	 man didnt i  laughter  brian matt question about everyones favorite npc from coelkiking how close was gilmore to  dying before vox machina found him under his shop  matt he was really close it was a choice it was whether or not you pursued the treasure the  money gold and items that had been shifted away from the clasp and looters or go directly for  gilmore and you had that choice vex and the rest of you as you were looting your way through and  the idea was going to be if you chose 
none	 to go for the money for the treasure gilmore would have  been dead when you found him mind you you could have possibly resurrected him or not depending  on what the timing was but that still would have been the knowledge going forward that you were  responsible for his death it was meant to be one of those crux choices of learning what it meant in  moments of crisis to fight against your own greed and selfserving ideas versus the greater good  andor friendships you made  laura but we did it  matt you 
none	 did it  travis we saved him  liam i also think its important to say that the last time we had dealt with death was way back  before it was a show we were in our home game and it was that and then vex dying in the tomb  were our first real brushes with death in the game so we didnt know how likely it was we  didnt know the rituals were this strange thing i thought it was just this onetime thing that  happened for that moment i didnt realize it was going 
none	 to be this mechanic that you implemented  into the game so both finding gilmore and when vex went down at least for me i was like oh my  god this is the end its all over and when i went unconscious too and we got more used to it  as a game mechanic i dont want to say we got used to it because every time was rough but it  was very new and unsettling in the beginning  matt good  brian yeah just what you want to hear laura question for you from kuributt 
none	 what did vex find  under gilmores bed when he sent them to marquet  laura oh have we not answered this before  brian i dont believe we have  laura oh man i found a bunch of love letters from gilmore and his first boyfriend  brian oh really thats awesome  laura so thats why i didnt tell anybody i just put it back because it seemed like okay  this is personal it was a good confirmation though that we were actually in gilmores bedroom  because up until that point we didnt know for sure 
none	  travis when did something being personal ever kept you from snagging something  laura it was letters what good was it going to do if it had been letters gilded in gold i would  have kept them but they were just letters  liam was there a name for the old beau  matt oh for his original  liam that she would have found on the letters  matt i believe it would have been  laura i dont remember that  matt i dont think i told you the name at the moment but it would 
none	 have been  brian taryon darrington  matt tie it all together no it would have been another marquesian boy and i would have had to  come up with a name on the spot  laura purvan  matt no were going to leave that name to the annals of history to never be brought up ever  again  brian next question matt crepuscularious wants to know i havent been in latin for a while do  they have latin class matt what were the horrible possibilities the team sidestepped with  kashaws resurrection of vex was invoking 
none	 vesh as much of a razors edge as it appeared  matt vesh the threat and the belief that kashaw holds in vesh was very powerful and vesh is a  dangerous entity on the scale that you guys were dealing with at the time definitely i dont  think it was so much a razors edge but it would have piqued her interest essentially an entity  that had been for the most part kept at the shadows and primarily focused on kashaws journey  would have been forced to turn an eye to vox machina and meddle in 
none	 those affairs and in a  weird way the deal with the raven queen circumvented that so much of the story changed  the moment that vax stepped forward the raven queens tomb the thought had approached me of  having vesh appear in that circumstance but because it was the raven queens tomb i think she  would have overridden that circumstance and what little glimpse vesh would have had would have just  piqued her curiosity she wouldnt be able to be there or exact any sort of immediate strange  occurrence its hard to look back in 
none	 the moment because some of that was improvised some of it  was just trying to feel it out yeah vesh isnt necessarily a god though she likes to put herself  in that form and say that she is kashaw definitely believes she is but shes not a god  brian okay interesting practically gods ashley question for you from thehollyphoenix  how did pike feel knowing that going and getting her armor probably made the difference between  daxio being destroyed and not  ashley uh  laughter  ashley you know i think very happy about it 
none	 what am i trying to say here i would say its a  good thing always a good thing  laura wait so we went and got pikes armor and fort daxio got destroyed what happened i dont  remember  brian there was a choice right between going and getting your armor probably made the  difference between daxio being destroyed or not that was the chest piece of gloriousness  matt plate of the dawnmartyr  brian thank you  marisha i like chest piece of gloriousness  travis you used it a billion times  ashley yeah 
none	 getting that was huge i mean i dont know how many times that i went unconscious  in battle after that but  laura a lot  ashley a lot and you know getting that vestige was such a huge part of pike feeling important in  battle getting the courage to go out and be in the middle and knowing that it would be okay if  she got knocked out a couple times and shed be fine  travis as grog it is not okay if she gets knocked out  marisha hey ashley can i ask you 
none	 a question  ashley yes  marisha what does the banner behind you say because it looks like it says boobs are magic  ashley books are magic but both are true  sam can i ask you a question who was the guy you were in love with  brian hey were going to get to that  sam we are  brian you can ask her i want you to ask her instead  ashley sorry i initially was trying to figure out what question you were asking brian sorry  sam shes ignoring me  brian did 
none	 you hear sams question to you  ashley oh i did im just not acknowledging it  laughter  brian matt mercer a question for you from someone with three names stephen david dugan  liam can i ask a connected question to the armor to matt senokirs box  matt were also going to get to that  liam thats later okay  matt i hope we are i hope were getting to that  laura is that a later arc or is that the same time  brian fucking let me do my job i will get there 
none	 goddamn it matt stephen david dugan wants to  know you guys are keeping stephen waiting how did kevdak come to have the titanstone knuckles  what were his aspirations beyond being a dragons lackey  matt i envision he got the knuckles by beating to an absolute bloody pulp the previous owner it  could have been a chance meeting it wasnt something that he sought the previous owner was  moving through the countryside in taldorei got waylaid by the herd of storms and unexpectedly  was bludgeoned to death and took them and once connected with these 
none	 gauntlets was like oh i  can rise to prominence in this kevdak was not the leader at the time and then brutally worked  his way up to become the person helming the herd of storms this would have been a young kevdak he had no  aspirations beyond that and just expanding the herd and taking what he wanted once the conclave  came and destroyed most of what was society protected society at that time that was when he  saw the opportunity like these guards cannot repel us they are disorganized they are focused  on 
none	 this other foe nows the time for us to finally live like kings that was when he  convinced the herd to charge westruun with him they were unprepared for them with a smaller  number of very focused and very powerful warriors and a populace where much of their guard had been  slaughtered or scattered they carved right into the heart and center and took over the city that  was when they made the deal with umbrasyl in which case at the time he was like i will work  with you but of course once you 
town	 have that taste of power and having the gauntlets as long as he  did he fully saw himself down the road destroying umbrasyl or bending umbrasyl to his will and then  being like dragon king kevdak i dont know if that would have ever happened but thats  definitely where he saw himself it was a fast power ramp in his mind of where he wanted to go  once he saw what he could do  brian wow so no dragon lackey for long  matt no not for long with that scenario  brian ashley you 
none	 had a question for matt what was that  ashley whats in the box that is the one question that i had this whole entire evening  brian she told me before the show i told everyone if you guys have questions for matt or  questions for each other interject those are the  most important ones ash was like i have one  question and its whats in the box what was in the box of senokirs wifes ashes  ashley yeah it still drives me crazy and when we were coming back for the last part of 
none	 the  wrapup and when we all met up and were like okay this is what we did in our time off for the  last games i was going to go look for the box and i forgot to tell you that when we were all in to  figure out what we were doing we started the game and i was like shit  matt do you really want to know ashley  all yes  sam another smaller box  matt practically no it was his wifes ashes he was completely 100 percent honest  travis ah 
none	 no kaiju no nothing growing out of the tree  brian was it the voice that made you guys uneasy for me it was the voice  laura he had that weird like uneasy noise  matt not every npc is out to fuck you  sam he was so squirrely and weird  laura i liked him i really liked him  taliesin he was one of my favorite npcs  matt oh my god i dont know where he came from  travis you almost desecrated a grave ashley  ashley i still dont believe you  travis 
none	 cant let it go yes he is real  taliesin he made the jewelry i gave everybody  liam its the other horn of orcus thats in there man  brian liam cainhurstcrow wants to know were you intending to multiclass into paladin before  the events of the raven queens tomb  liam i was strongly considering it i hadnt made up my mind but i was leaning that way because i  was already forming this new branch of friendship with pike and being fascinated with the things  that she did and i was feeling like such 
none	 a the same vax who was saying what the fuck are we  doing here this is stupid there is no purpose to our lives he saw that in pike first people  were like i think liams going to go cleric and i was like nah this is just part of the  story but then i started believing it myself and then when everything eh  matt yeah because youd even strapped a symbol of sarenrae to your hand at one point you  were starting to push that direction of a faith follower of sarenrae  liam 
none	 and without dragging everything out of the store rough time in my life and when that  happened i remember we had a meeting the group got together like a week later and i was not  happy about how that went down  laura you were so mad  liam i wasnt interested in the armor i didnt want the armor with everything going on for me i  was like this is so heavy on top of my heavy and it turned into this i dont know i wouldnt  trade it for anything at this point but 
none	 boy it was a tunnel  matt im sorry  liam no none of us know what were doing  matt its just where the narrative went i didnt expect any of that to happen i didnt expect you  to die i didnt expect there to be a ritual i didnt expect it and it was one of those things  where because it was in the raven queens temple it would be any place where she would reveal  herself as part of this ritual or an image of herself an avatar of herself and then when you 
none	  made that decree it was like oh shell accept this changes the whole direction of the  character and where that story for you was going on just one series of chance moments  liam followup question fatetouched always going to be a thing or do you think that just  sprang out of that moment  matt no to be perfectly honest i decided on the fatetouched thing because i knew you were going  through some hard stuff and i wanted to give some little special light to you  sam oh matt  matt i didnt 
none	 know when it was going to come up  brian oh buddy dont go under there  laura i saw spiders  brian wow thats really special  matt i didnt know when it was going to come up i thought it might be more of a latecampaign  reveal like once things got more epic in scale and you were working with divinity someone would  recognize and point that out and would be like oh but that moment made complete sense when  you made that decree to the raven queen and with her being the purveyor over 
none	 fate i was like  well this is the moment where it would come up  liam this fucking game  laura i have a similar followup question are there any more cookies because i really want a  cookie  brian you can go get them at the break  laura yes  brian you can absolutely have cookies at the break travis during the kevdak fight  cainhurstcrow wants to know did you initially go in thinking you could win headon against kevdak  or did you always intend for vox machina to come into the fray  
none	 travis i had no idea i just know i wanted to face him headon to start with even if it was  going to go south super fast like it did i just wanted to get an idea and i was woefully  unprepared especially when matt was like you realize that he is not taking as much damage as  you think he should i was like oh shit it was nice that everybody had taken up positions and  everything and then i knew it would be a good chance to just call in arms and just trying 
none	 to  set a little bit of a trap but he got to face him on his terms and thats all i really wanted  matt i was really rooting for you in that fight there was a possibility that grog could have won  that oneonone but if i recall the dice just did not go in your direction  travis the rolls were not happening he pinned me on a spike disarmed me i only hit two times out  of five turns yeah it was not going well  matt i had considered both sides of it 
none	 if you managed to take him down in oneonone combat it  would have been a very different scenario then it would have turned into a temporary very tense  diplomatic conversation with the herd but then when you guys had finished the fight and destroyed  him and his righthand man it was like all right we need to reevaluate this  travis and we were learning what the knuckles did i remember matt saying you remember seeing  kevdak reached out and crushed a guys skull with his bare hands and i had no idea he would  
none	 enlarge that the bloodaxe would also add all of this stuff and i was just like oh god what  did i step into  liam such a ride though that night  matt its one of my favorite moments in the game  taliesin the toothpicks alone those toothpicks made me so happy  brian question for laura from aegisofages when you found out you had been assigned a new  alignment did you change the way you were playing vex i only ask you this question because you  just rudely put food in your mouth during an 
none	 interview show  laura i dont think i deserved that change in alignment  brian why  laura chewing because it wasnt that bad  brian what do you mean  laura chewing all i did was steal a broom  brian all you did was what  laura steal a broom  brian thats all you did how come its still brought up to this day if it was all you did was  steal a broom lots of people  laura i was going to give him a whole bunch of dragon scales but he walked away too 
none	 fast  brian i didnt understand a word of that were going to have to move on  liam on my sisters behalf im shocked that vexs alignment changed and percys did not  because this guy is a fucked up motherfucker who did fucked up shit left and right  brian thats true  matt you can have fucked up thoughts and not necessarily act on them completely  laura he did though  liam he gave a sword to this dude he shot a kid through the hand hes a lunatic  matt well the shot to the 
none	 hand was  travis the sword is a gift how is that bad  laura i think it changed because matt misunderstood my motivations for things  brian matt do you feel like you misunderstood lauras motivation for things  matt its possible but i considered a lot of lauras motions going in those specific moments  and a lot of things that had happened going towards a series of selfish things that  didnt necessarily toward the betterment of other people  laura hey thats a good point  matt and that is the calling card of a chaotic 
none	 neutral character if you had stolen the broom for  a greater good or a necessary purpose to save people or  laura no it was just because i wanted to fly  matt it was purely because you wanted to fly and there had been a number of moments like that where  i had kind of been considering it for a while and that was a big moment where i was like all  right ill knock you down but once again alignment doesnt make a huge difference i dont  think alignment should be a guide for 
none	 the roleplay i think it should be reactive to the  roleplay and more of an indicator i agree with elements of alignment in games and i disagree  with elements of it i keep it in because its a relic of the times and it works as a decent guide  here and there but its not a big deal  brian yeah sam  sam yessir  brian question for you from karraxx what was in the letter that scanlan gave to pike  sam what was in the letter that scanlan gave to pike  brian yep 
none	  sam ill just read it to you  travis incredulous oh you got it oh the old digital device  sam lets see mmhmm okay  laura you just have it right there  sam i figured this would come up  laughter  sam ahem dearest pike my entire life ive been half a man not in stature nor confidence nor  certainly not in reputation but you see even though my heart has pumped blood for these 69  years it has done so only as half a heart the moment i first saw you was not 
none	 a choir of angels  singing nor silly butterflies fluttering in my chest no the moment i met pike trickfoot i  havent read this in a year the moment i met pike trickfoot was the tragic moment i realized  that my heart my soul would be forever incomplete without you for years ive strived to  mend to mend my incomplete heart to join it with yours and find true bliss at your side though it  may not have seemed so everything ive done these past years has been to impress you please you  protect you 
none	 i knew early on it was a futile effort im not stupid the entire world may be  mad but that doesnt nullify the laws of reality one law being that you are and will always be  too good for a poor pennysinger like scanlan shorthalt but even though i would not win you  your love i could never stop trying does the sun stop rising when the clouds blot it out no like  me it knows its purpose to illuminate the world so that mortals can witness such beauty as you  travis oh my god 
none	  sam jesus this is good  laughter  travis youre getting laid tonight by yourself  sam but now as the sun sets on my lifei guess i was dying  travis you cant open it unless you die  sam oh thats right okay good but now as the sun sets on my life i have discovered something  new i have a daughter whose heart beats my blood and whose life is my own and she unlike her  father can be good and right and one day worthy of your love which is why on my 
none	 deathbed i  leave her to you dont you see this whole time i thought i was chasing a lover but instead i have  been chasing a mother for my child you pike trickfoot are the savior to kaylie that i could  never be your wisdom and honor and goodness can give her the chance at redemption that i never  had pike take my daughter as your own show her the light of sarenrae guide her to be a  kindhearted gnome teach her to be everything her father was not that way in death my oh 
none	 man  im going to cry  laughter  sam that way in death my heart will be complete and it will beat inside kaylie by your  side like i always dreamed it would with love and respect burt reynolds esquire  cheering  marisha how much is scanlan repurposing that for his vows  liam dani carr just ascended straight to heaven off camera  laughter  brian that was fantastic well done  sam i havent read that since i wrote it thats really good  laughter  brian itll be hanging in several critters houses soon 
none	 probably  travis ashley did you feel bad for reading that early  ashley nope  laughter  laura wait a minute you wrote 69 in that thing and then in the wrapup episode you said you were  in your forties or fifties  sam no 70  laura really  sam yeah  laura okay  brian matt evilgeniusreborn has a question in your head what vestiges did you intend to go to  which player  matt i had some vestiges that were definitely geared towards specific players like mythcarver  for scanlan the titanstone knuckles for 
none	 grog and the spire for keyleth but when it came to the  deathwalkers ward the cabals ruin those were a little more open it was going to be between the  three of you guys and there was the possibility of someone doubling up on vestiges with fenthras  that was probably going to go to you but depending on who wanted to focus on what it was  either the opportunity of people swapping them or one person was better with a single vestige or  multiple vestiges that could be decided i didnt know who was going 
none	 to take deathwalkers ward but  it was the first vestige you had encountered and it was probably going to be one of you five who  would use leather consistently other than those few that were very specifically tailored for those  classes i left the others open for choice and who wanted to adopt them and then once you had made  the choice with the raven queen and the temple it was like well i feel like that choice is  definitely made  laura yeah but it didnt go to you right away  liam no 
none	 you took it initially  laura yeah and then i gave it to him  matt thats right  laura yeah and then i found out it fucking had wings mother  liam a lot of disappointments in this game laura  taliesin did we exalt all of the vestiges  travis everything that we had  matt everything that you had  taliesin okay just curious  laura i like that theres other vestiges in the world for the next campaign  matt oh yeah theres plenty of vestiges good and bad vestiges theyre everywhere  brian taliesin a 
none	 lot of people were interested and you didnt want to talk about it at the time  but if this is the time and place question from phorsi what did the party have to say to  convince you to come back from the dead  taliesin oh god it was less what they had to say and what they could have said that wouldve made  him say no there were certain appeals that they could have made that i wouldve ignored  matt i feel like religion was a big one  taliesin religion was a big one 
none	 i was prepared for any attempts to call upon a god to bring him  back he would have been like no no no but it was all about finding reasons to come back i  was really happy to let it be a 5050 flip i could have gone either way that could have been a  great end to that character  matt it would have been a great end to percys story i had made peace with that end for him and  we had talked about other character possibilities i think elements of your character in 
none	 the next  campaign started as your alternative character for percy and decided to go  taliesin absolutely  matt but when vex dropped that bomb in the middle of the  taliesin yep that did it  matt it was like well thats going to be a hard press for taliesin to talk that one away  taliesin yeah that did it  brian matt concerning the dragons charlie john boychuk wants to know what would have happened  had vox machina permitted raishan her time with thordaks corpse  matt so what raishan was doing with thordaks corpse 
none	 was an ancient variant of speak with dead  now when you cast speak with dead you rise the spirit up and you can ask it questions and it can  decide whether or not it wants to answer truthfully or answer at all what she was  concocting was a more intense version of that that actually tortures and forces information out of  his soul what she was trying to do was be given a moment where she could extract information from  thordaks soul and the information she wanted was the location of opashs lair and what 
none	 he wanted  what was the secret the secret to her it wasnt opashs lair it was what was the secret to her  getting rid of the disease that she knew she saw in his eyes that he was truthful about from the  very beginning and that information was opashs lair and when you interrupted her she sealed you  guys off continued with the ritual got enough information to get out of there to opashs lair  teleport there and then got the rest of the information she needed when she had absconded with  it so 
none	 thats why when she left and she put the force wall there it was just to keep you at bay  just to give her enough time to get the information she needed to know where to go and  then took his corpse with her so she could get the last bit of information when she had found herself there  brian what were the significance of the eggs  matt oh thordak was mutating thordak was becoming something new  brian yeah was the sickness real or was that a power play thing  matt no the sickness 
none	 is very real  brian okay okay so the eggs  matt the soul curse on raishan was very real and raishan was very very desperate to find a way as  it began to it was continuing to spread as the years went on and she knew her time was limited  and she needed to find a way out and she as a natural deceiver can see through lies at an  instinctual basic level and when her first battle with thordak led to thordak saying i can help  you with that i know a way to 
none	 stop that which was his eventual plan of becoming a dracolich  brian wow and then the eggs  matt and the eggs were an unexpected circumstance when they had put the soul anchor  within thordak and kept him in the fire elemental plane the sheer force of elemental chaos began to  change him and shift him and eventually he began to in a jurassic park kind of way no longer be a  particular sex just began to become an entity that gave birth to create progeny  travis life finds a way  matt life finds 
none	 a way so the eggs were and are a representation of a new species a primal  elemental dragon  laura and we killed them all  matt you killed them all as far as you know  brian i hate that term  travis what does that mean  matt that means thats an invitation for anybody whos playing a campaign in taldorei thats for  any of you guys out there that are playing in the game that could be something  laura fuck we should have kept a baby dragon  brian that is all the time 
none	 we have to discuss the chroma conclave now we are trying to focus  tonights discussion on obviously you guys talking to each other and also discussing things  that havent been talked about yet either in panels ad nauseum or on previous talks machina  episodes or whatever so if theres something you feel like we didnt touch we are now in where we  started talks machina so you can go back suffer through the first few episodes and then find joy  later in life towards episode 53 which was i believe last weeks character stats as 
none	 we end  arc three grog rages 86 total  travis 86 rages  brian 86 rages  sam almost every session  brian i wouldve thought more right but yeah almost every session pike healing 3658 hp  travis dang  brian vex arrows 474  laura oh see so i had plenty left  sam well there were some offscreen i assume  laura meh  brian now i have to check with andrew at critrolestats to make sure this means what i think  it means but it says percy misfires 36  taliesin that sounds about 
none	 right  brian dm facepalms 264  marisha he did that more than you raged  laura oh my god  matt thats what you guys do to me thats your fault  marisha sorry  brian keyleth beast shapes 110 times what do you think the most used was  laura eagle  travis planetar  marisha earth elemental  brian youre correct 15 earth elemental times scanlan inspirations 136 and every one of them  fucking gold  laughter  brian and vax oneshot kills 21 oneshot kills  taliesin 21 friends we never got to make

none	 to the dealers left they only get three thats the price you pay for going first the  remaining cards become the draw pile next four luminary cards are randomly dealt facedown and  placed in the corner of each field the bottom of the game box known as the illimat is placed  center and four okus tokens are placed on top align this box so the arrow is pointing to the  dealer illimat is played over a series of rounds usually two to three per game points are tallied  at the end of each round after 
none	 players have harvested cards from the mat heres the scoring  system four points to the player who harvests the most cards this is called the bumper crop two  points for harvesting the most summer cards minus two points to whomever harvested the most winter  cards each fool card luminary and okus token are each worth one point gameplay starts to the  left of the dealer each turn a player must play one card from their hand and perform one of  the following actions harvest by playing one card from their one hand a player can 
none	 collect one  or more cards with the matching value from a field in addition to taking single cards a  player can also collect combinations of cards from a single field that add together to equal the  value of the card from their hand they then add the cards to their personal harvest pile for  points at the end of a rond sow a player may discard a card from their hand into a field  stockpile by placing a card from their hand onto an existing card on the field a player can create  a 
none	 single stack for future harvesting this stack acts as one card and cannot be separated stacks  can either be multiple instances of one value or individual cards combined together to create a  higher value if a stack has multiple instances of one value its considered locked on that value and  cannot be added to as single cards in order to do any stockpiling a player must also have a card in  their hand that matches the value of the stack within these three actions some other effects may  occur for instance if a face card 
none	 was played on a turn rotate the illimat so the season of the  field matches the season of the played card any face cards from the star suit mean a player can  choose where to rotate the illimat seasons also have different effects on the field they face  winter means no harvesting over there autumn no sowing spring denies stockpiling of course in  summer anything is possible when harvesting if a player clears a field by removing the last card  a number of effects can occur first if any okus tokens remain on the illimat 
none	 the player gains  one if the luminary card in the field is face down flip it and resolve its effects effects are  listed in the rulebook im not going to go over all of them here but they include things like  forcing the seasons to change and allowing players to use two cards in a harvest instead of one if  the luminary card is already face up the player adds it to their harvest and resolves any of its  reward effects the field is then reseeded with three cards from the draw pile unless the 
none	 draw  pile has less than three cards or the luminary is already face up ooh a fool of summer a fool  card can either be a one or a 14 depending on what you want it to be if you harvest a fool  card you get an additional one point at the end of the round at the end of their turn players  draw back up to four cards in their hand and play passses to the left this continues until all the  cards from the deck and the players hands are gone then points 
none	 are totaled for the round once  a player reaches 17 or more points they win and thats illimat i should mention this game was  commissioned by the band the decemberists thats why im having chris funk and the games creator  keith baker to play illimat on a special game the game on december 6th you can watch this live on  twitchtvgeekandsundry or projectalphacom come check it out and keep playing games  music  brian welcome back and please welcome some of our favorite guest stars from critical roles journey  thus far mary elizabeth mcglynn 
none	 will friedle darin de paul jason charles miller and noelle  stevenson thank you guys for joining us thank you for coming  will thanks for having us  mary were not dead  brian well theres still time before we get into a few questions we have to do a round of  quick plugs because you guys you know theres so many people in the geek  sundry and alpha family  now darin and amy do a morning show every monday at 800am  darin monday morning at 800am really early on alpha we do stuff we 
none	 have a couple episodes left  and were really excited  brian its been awesome  darin yes its been an absolute dream amy vorpahl is a wonderful partner and makes me laugh  harder than anyone i know and its just joy  brian some of the producers sean and dani were telling me how much of a joy it is to get up at  430 in the morning on sunday nights to no but everybody says if you have to come in early and  do an early show darin and amy are the best people in 
none	 the world to  darin were very happy people and also awful people for being that happy that early in the  morning  brian yes absolutely  will shes really cool  darin shes really cool and a great dd player as well  brian indeed yeah indeed and painters guild is coming back  will season two painters guild january 8th yeah were bigger and better this year so its  very cool  brian because youve been lifting weights im confused  will no because before where we had a table in a hallway that was literally 
none	 it so yeah we  are  brian oh yeah thats true yeah theres a set  will we have a big old set and were interviewing guests and meeting some cool painters some cool  artists so yeah its a cool season  brian jason youve got starter kit too  jason starter kit every thursday and thrashtopia every wednesday  brian my god and noelle and mary are unemployed currently have nothing no we were just  talking you guys both have several projects but you cant talk about them  mary cant talk about any of them 
none	 weve got the kingsman chip in our necks our heads will  explode  will i can tell you what they are ive signed no such forms  mary i know everything therefore  brian it is funny to think about going back to the beginning of critical role coming onto geek   sundry and now thinking about the three of you who have been on the show and now have your own  shows here and how beloved you are from the community and the two of you as well when we  sent out and said who 
none	 do you guys want us to have on as guests and everyone said joe no im  kidding  will i figured it wouldve been us sitting here like this and you wouldve just seen the torso  brian the tweet joe replied and said everyone better say me or ill come after you  will hes a large fellow  brian he is yeah not next to travis though i was told i had to say that what has been for you  guys the biggest difference between coming on a show like critical role and playing dd at 
none	 home or  maybe even a event stream or oneoff or something like that whats been the biggest difference  between stepping into this behemoth than doing something at home  mary well it was my first behemoth i mean i learned on the show id never played before i  had no idea what i was doing and it was just trial by fire  will me too exact same thing id never played first time i played was on camera  brian going back would you prefer to be thrown in the deep end like that or yeah 
none	  will i liked it yeah i mean if youre going to play  darin i liked being the character that id played years and years ago because ultimately  its acting its what we do its a big improv scene its yes and so getting to work with  fabulous performers and creating a character and creating an adventure thats pretty cool  noelle i think the biggest difference is that people actually care about your character which  if you play a home game and youre like oh my god let me tell you about my sorcerer character 
none	  or whatever and theyre like yeah all right i dont know you what are you talking about but  then all of a sudden everyones like oh i saw your character i love your heres a drawing of  your character im like this is like a dream come true this is so amazing i didnt know that this  was allowed to happen  will its like what they say with fantasy sports they say theres nothing more interesting than  your own fantasy team and nothing less interesting than somebody elses so thats what its like  
none	 with dd people come and tell you about their home games and until i really played i didnt  care and now you kind of hear it and youre like oh what are you doing and so you do you want  to listen you want to hear and all that good kind of stuff  noelle its like having a dream and someone is like tell me more about that  darin heres the thing im breaking it down for you im getting real when you play at home you  dont get fan art end of discussion  
dung	 mary with this were part of a community now that is a continually expanding community of  positivity and positive worldcreating building improvisation its creativity and in times of  darkness to create something is a wonderful source of light right and its a great community  to be a part of  will its like when you go to a convention and you walk around you go oh theres millions of  me because you think youre the only one that paints minis or reads comic books in the dark and  then you walk around you go oh 
none	 other people are dressed up too it makes everything great  darin youre home and it kind of feels that way coming on to critical role its like  sharing a time with everybody oh im home  jason i think playing the game with matt as the dm its a great game but then what happens  afterward thats really the difference of the fan art the people that are interacting that are  talking about your character that know your character better than you thats really the big  difference in playing a homebrew game and playing it 
none	 here  brian everybody whos come on the show even for just one appearance has said that that exact  thing has been one of the biggest impacts on them afterwards besides the amazing fan art that ends  up happening mary and will for you guys what was it like being on the show in the early  episodes versus coming in and being in the later episodes what was the biggest difference for you  besides not shooting on what looked like the bedroom of a fiveyearold  will and sharing a bench with somebody half your asscheek 
none	 off one of the benches as travis needed  space  mary well it was weird because id never played before and theres felicia day and everything and  i was terrified steves whole philosophy of parenting is just keep your kids alive until  theyre 18 so my whole philosophy about dd was dont kill the team dont kill vox machina and  i was more terrified about that than anything you know but to be there sandwiched between laura  and travis i was home already so i felt safe and i felt inspired to fail to screw 
none	 up and to dive  in unabashedly and bravely  will my philosophy was smile nod and shift your papers around like you know what youre doing the  old shifting that all i was doing was shifting my papers because again the improv i didnt have  a problem with but then you get into rules and you get with somebody like matt i mean the  perfect example was one of the episodes that we did were there with wheaton who i think knows a  thing or two about dd as well and at one point it 
none	 was apparently my cleric i had no idea you  could turn undead so at one point he looks at me and he goes turn undead and it was like i  dont know what im doing give me a break here so it was that moment of just keep your mouth  shut smile be funny and shift your papers around until we figure out what to do and youre  trying to figure out the spells and all that stuff its a very indepth game and when you jump  right in the middle of people who know 
none	 what theyre doing it can be really disconcerting  brian just shout what youre supposed to do to your other players dd 101  mary but then later on when we came back we would get together and be like okay what are we  going to do lets team up and i think thats what sort of birthed their relationship  will when we teamed up everything kind of changed with playing because you and i formed a  bond and it was like lets just go from there so that was helpful  brian thats true and that 
town	 was a bond that the community really resonated with  darin that was my first time actually on set here  mary that was the first time i met you  darin yeah we met for the first time we were watching and you kissed  will oh that was the kiss scene kash kissed keyleth yeah  darin and i was just going i wonder if ill ever be part of this world  mary i just got into town i like voiceover whats your name  will thats when i realized how big the community was when kash 
none	 kissed keyleth i was like  okay two fictional characters kissed no big deal and then artwork and everything and it was  like oh man yeah it was a big deal i didnt know that was going to happen it was kind of fun  it was like yeah just kiss her and walk out  mary but thats the fun  will yeah its great  brian it is thats improv i mean too  mary we made up the pregnancy right before we came on stage  will literally right before we came on stage she looked 
none	 at me and she goes zahras going to be  pregnant i was like oh youve got to do that and that was it  mary hiding behind the paint cans like  brian oh yeah you guys were hiding back here by the paint cans because the cast didnt know you  were here jason in addition to doing the most epic theme song of all time  all yeah applause  brian i have a question for you but before that we had a moment in the office where i saw jason  before we started taping and 
none	 his phone went off and he has the critical role ring tone i was  like hey hell yeah dude thats a badass song you should have that as your ringtone so for  you going back what was it like to play a character who wasnt really on the same side as  the players wasnt necessarily on the same side as the players  jason well i mean the problem really was i can separate myself to a certain extent but i love  everybody already so i wasnt on the same side but luckily there was a 
none	 uneasy truce because we  were all trying to survive at that point and maybe if he had continued there might have been  some foul play but at least for that moment we were relatively on the same side id say yeah  brian what surprised you the most about that episode  jason there werent really too many actually what surprised me was i was sitting next to liam  and he had the chatroom open and i remember that in combat i called out that there was an attack  of opportunity for my character and then 
none	 chat just went crazy like oh yeah this guy knows  how to play this game he knows about attack of opportunity so for me it was the instant  commentary of every single move that i made in that combat was immediately on liams phone so i  thought that was pretty cool  brian thats so weird and whats crazy is liam was in a total chatroom that wasnt for critical  role at the time hes a part of several of those  will fetish what  brian i knew you would have one for me noelle 
none	 talk to me about jumping into such an intense  episode because you actually ended up being part of the nine hells  noelle yeah  brian why did you choose to play another prisoner versus a plausible demon that lived there  noelle well if i could have i wouldve played a shopkeeper or another shopper who might have been  maybe introduced in the episode a little sooner  brian you got to answer a lot of emails though before  noelle yeah it was like okay all right no by all means carry on but no that 
none	 was actually  something that matt told me that night that i was going to be a prisoner and they were going to meet  me because that was part of my backstory but it was it was really intense i was playing tova as  a burner character a little bit where its kind of like if she dies it would be okay its the  only time im ever going to play a character where maybe i do want to go out in a blaze of  glory a lot of it was trying to have fun play 
none	 the game but also try not to step on any of the  really big moments that were happening with the team and try and help them get to their next big  thing so im really glad i got to be there for that last scene it felt really important and  even though tova didnt end up going back with them it was a really moving moment it was cool  to see  brian and she survived too as we found out  noelle yeah canonically its true shes alive shes what running a bear society not 
none	 entirely  sure  brian some sort of weird bearland type thing yeah i am interested whats more nervewracking  or terrifying starting the show at the beginning or waiting for your character to come in in the  middle of an episode how some of you were introduced the waiting is really hard right  noelle my heart was going so fast i was like is that me no thats not me  brian oh yeah whenever matt says and you turn a corner and you see like nervous yelling  will well its the difference in starting at 
none	 the beginning of the river where you can get on the  boat slowly and go or just jumping into the raging part so theres times when theyre in the  middle of something huge and its like oh and then here comes and you walk in like oh my  god were right in the middle of this  mary what if we screw it up  will yeah youre going to die because of me because you said something interesting there are  times you do go all right im a guest star so if i die thats 
none	 kind of okay and might be a cool  way to go and you do have that moment and then youre thinking oh my god what if i take one of  them with me oh my god so its pretty horrifying as well  mary we talked a lot about doing a thelma and louise  will we thought about trying to go out in a blaze of glory  mary well just if somebody was on the verge were just like all right gun it  will but then i think i rolled a natural one and we 
none	 were both thrown off the cliff that was the  end of that there we go thanks for coming now leave  brian that final vecna battle episode where we had a few guests here you were hidden from the  cast and we were in the back room and stuff and then joe had this backpack with his wyrmwood and  his players guide and all this stuff and then at one point were all sitting in the back and he  wasnt trying to hide it all he grabbed all his shit and was like well see you 
none	 later guys  and then he walked out and onto screen and we were like well there goes that surprise  will we were trying mary was like i have to go to the bathroom and then five minutes later it  was like i have to go to the bathroom  brian you guys did great and then i think everybody caught on and it was like screw it  will did we tell everybody that while we were in the back room we had a death pool going  brian yeah we did we talked about it i 
none	 think we tweeted pictures of it too darin  darin hi im darin  brian yes we should really start the show by the way your storyline really dealt with  redemption and that seemed to be embraced by the fans in a really intense way that not a lot of  other even characters or even some of the more beloved npcs that had longer drawnout storylines  were identified with i think a lot of that has to do with the sentiment that you had played 37 years  ago with matts mom in a game and all 
none	 that stuff talk to me about the experience of playing a  character who ultimately i mean lost everything in one episode only to find a purpose with ioun  talk to me about that experience  darin coolest thing ever again i thought that when he was shot full of arrows that was it i  went thats a great way to go out and then we got better and better and better and i love that  he had redemption originally i thought of him as fagin that he was going to steal everything he  could but 
none	 the goodness about everybody brought out the goodness in him playing as an actor i  would look over and liams face was in such delight that it was a joy to watch and im like  oh well were just going to have fun with this and that he is still alive that hes still  up there and that he had this wonderful exit just arguing with ioun thats kind of cool it  was a good little thing to play i love playing funny characters who are also tragic i think  theres a lot of depth 
none	 in that and maybe thats what resonated with the audience that this utter  goof got to have his hero moment and got to cry with keyleth i do that  brian and looked so good while doing it darin  darin thank you has anyone else worn fancy clothes when theyre playing  mary i wore a white tuxedo jacket for the final battle  will thats right you did i had pants on  mar i had a shera shirt on under it  darin so two of us  noelle i wore my fancy flannel you guys 
none	 got the good ones  jason i wore my favorite hat  brian theres a shocker  will we have to beg you to wear a shirt during our home game  mary im just hoping you wear pants  brian mary put a sign on the door that says no shirt no pants no brian  will were only doing that because you roll so poorly  brian wil wheaton and i roll terribly what is something from your experience on critical role  this past year and a half that you guys will definitely take with you i 
none	 know we talked about  the community but what was something about being on the show it could be something hilarious that was  said it could be a sentiment or perhaps a hidden crush on one of the cast members  will you werent supposed to tell travis  brian i didnt he cant hear hes in the cone of silence  mary whats amazing is were roleplaying but there are these unbelievably emotional moments we  brought lauras character back to life just crying and it was like im playing dd on the  internet and im crying 
dung	 its so moving its great to just completely invest yourself in  something that youre making up as we go i talked to laura about this a lot at a convention im not  a writer so this is the one thing that ive created with the help of matt as mine with  everybody else we create our characters ensemble its amazing unique experience  brian when you guys are out and about going to conventions or events theres people everywhere  who come up and talk about this show  will dress like our characters  mary they 
none	 named a puppy zahra i mean come on  will its nuts  brian and still making art and everything else its crazy  darin theyll come up and be in tears no this was as special for all of us as it was for you and  thank you for embracing these characters taking them to here and here  jason i was playing a concert in baltimore and someone yelled out we love you garthok okay  awesome  will its crazy  mary thats amazing  will i have to say what i will take away as 
none	 much as i love the game and its completely  transformed certain aspects of my life because we have our home game i knew matt well because we  did thundercats together but i knew travis and laura id met all these people but i didnt know  them well so getting to know them and becoming close to them and friends with all of them thats  what ill take away i feel like ive gotten all new friends of out this you and mary ive got a  whole new set of friends out of this which is 
none	 something ill take with me forever dd is  amazing critical role is amazing the relationships its formed is something ill never  forget  brian our game is one of the hundreds or more started because of this show  darin i knew working with matt in my episode was going to be delightful and i wanted to have a moment  with marisha that was my aim because i think shes a wonderful actress capable of so many  things that was my favorite thing when she thought she had killed me and we were just weeping  
none	 and in tears and going its okay were just there and we couldnt touch and it was just this  is acting this broadway this is a scene i hope you appreciate it because its really good  brian you know when you feel it you go i hope its coming across as strongly as i feel it  darin you hope that the picture youre painting in your mind other people are because its so  vivid and wonderful i would sit home and watch these guys on the show and marvel in it i was a  huge 
none	 fan before i even got the opportunity to go on  brian i remember one of the first nights of talks machina i come on the set and darin is taking  pictures i go whats going on he goes sorry dude can i take some pictures im like yes  dude im so honored to meet you what the fuck he just showed up and hes geeking out over all  the trinkets we have no pun intended  darin im just mouthstupid i told matt its my theater coming from theater in new york i was  like 
none	 this is what i watched on thursday for the story and characters and it was theater for me i  loved how it evolved and the tragedy the comedy  will good storys good story i dont care what medium it comes in good storys good story plain  and simple  noelle theres a universality what am i trying to say universal nature to dd that is all the  stories are different every game is different every dm runs things a different way but there is  this familiarity to everything we were talking about this before when 
none	 mary and i met for the  first time and it was like okay were going to work together whats that going to be like i  think she was wearing a d20 necklace so i was like oh you play shes like im a tiefling  warlock and i was like im a tiefling warlock and that was all we talked about for the rest of  the day everyone else in the room was like what the fucks going on  mary do we now want to keep talking about the show  noelle the job the show 
none	 and its like oh no hang on what about that infernal theres  something that you recognize and everyones experience with it is different i was pretty new  to dd too it was the second character id ever played on critical role but it was the community  and the way that people connected with that because it was familiar it was recognizable in some way  that was what elevated it its not just about you and your character its about contributing to  this much bigger thing even outside of critical role to the wider dd world 
none	 thats what people see  themselves in thats something thats really special thats something ill take away and  continue to treasure about dd in general  will anything positive in this world is so beautiful  brian i completely agree  will its such a wonderful thing we need more of it if it comes with you and your friends sitting  down and playing a game thats what you do  noelle collaborating with people to create something like a story it means something  brian i want to live in a world where we continue to engage 
none	 the imagination in a way that  doesnt involve us simply being a participant  mary or an observer  brian yeah thats what i meant watching tv versus being the story  mary watching people play games or whatever its getting involved make your own game  will waking up every morning and saying i will create  darin thats what happens with this game with these performers is total commitment to character  its not im a joke character with a joke name and im just here to add some jokes no i am in this  world

none	 question is for sam this comes from quietbatpeople if revivify had been  successful in the second fight against raishan and scanlan hadnt had to go through the res ritual  would he still have left vox machina was it the act of dying or the circumstances surrounding the  ritual kaylie etc that were more influential  sam this is so exciting for me it was the act of dying that pushed him over the edge he was not  present for the revivify ritual so he does not know what happened in it not really he heard  
none	 distant voices  laura only the ones that succeeded  sam yeah sorry travis  travis that hurts  sam no it was the dying there was a long buildup to him leaving he had discovered his  daughter it brought it front and center that he was a shithead for most of his life the gang  didnt really listen to him that much he was doing stuff with drugs or trying to anyway then  he had this terrible streak didnt he die twice in a row or get knocked out a bunch of times he  didnt 
none	 even have that any more he didnt have his mojo pike had said no it was a whole big bunch  of stuff that was not going well for young shorthalt then to get knocked down again he  cant even help his people in battle what use is he hes nothing he should have walked away and  then they made fun of him when he woke up oh my god terrible  brian you wouldve done the same though  sam oh yeah  taliesin i was waiting for that thank you  sam yeah but in the 
none	 moment it seemed particularly bad  marisha sure  brian matt regarding the kraken hawaiianxngel wants to know could vox machina  have had the chance of killing it even though they werent supposed to what would have  happened if the kraken died  matt they totally could have if circumstances allowed them to or if they decided to if the  kraken had died the lodestone sources that both prevent the expansion of the rift between the  water elemental plane and the ocean there would have been lost the lodestones do slowly  degenerate over time they 
none	 also keep vesrah aloft above the ocean it wouldve begun to sink  marisha thats why i kept screaming dont kill the fucking kraken grog  matt it wouldnt have been immediate it wasnt like all of sudden it dies and it collapses over  the next five or so years when they began to degenerate and they wouldnt have had a source  the would have had to find another kraken and either continue to farm in that area or lure one  closer to the rift it would have fucked up their entire ecosystem and wouldve had to 
none	 find a new  way to do it  marisha go find another kraken giant squid go find a second one  brian plenty of krakens in the sea as my grandmother used to say ashley a question for  you before bedtime from shackleface which is technically ashleys pet name for me youve  mentioned that if youd been able to be there for scanlans departure pike wouldve had a few  things to say to him what sort of things would you have said  ashley i feel like i got into that as we played some games 
none	 with scanlan again i think grog and  pike were so hurt i think me as a player was hi i think me as a player i was bummed because i  was gone so much and then he left while i was gone and then there was this new guy i mean taryon  was great but come on i want to play with scanlan i know i said a lot of the things in one  of the later games after he came back once pike got the courage i dont know thats one of those  things 
none	 that you never know that maybe i dont think pike would have been able to stop him he  was going to go no matter what  brian sam any thoughts  sam she couldve probably stopped me  marisha she wouldve been the only one right  sam shes probably the only one who couldve stopped me  marisha i remember deep into that conversation i remember all of us reaching this point of were  talking in circles youre going to leave  sam you helped you changed the trajectory of what i was going to do i 
none	 was just going to go off  and then little vexy said why dont you go spend some time with your daughter and i was  like oh thats a good idea  brian matt question for you from luap82517 what would have happened if keyleth had failed  her aramente trial would she have been able to try again  matt no actually in failing the aramente keyleth wouldve stepped aside she could still  join whatever small council there is to the air ashari alongside her father korren but somebody  else wouldve been chosen to take on 
none	 the aramente to become the next leader  laura damn that wouldve sucked  marisha its not meant to be redone at all  matt its not always bloodrelated classically its a generational thing but it also can go to  whoever is the most worthy and willing to take the aramente  marisha you have the choice to tap out  matt you can say no if you dont feel like you want to  marisha once again keyleth got close several times to being like fuck this  brian laura question for you from thistinsoldier this arc is 
none	 where vex saw the  true face of wealth in tarys arsenal and his pomp and attitude was this one of the deciding factors  that mellowed her moneygrubbing tendencies  laura nah  brian matt question for you  laura no i mean no once she got money thats what mellowed her out once she became rich enough  that she didnt have to fucking worry about paying for things anymore she was like okay this is  what its like  sam yeah we all know that when rich people get rich they stop theyre like im good 
none	 and  they just are good people from then on  brian i have reached the number i told myself at five would satiate me and yeah our next question  comes from jorncener so close to john cena matt what was the plan for hotis assuming vox  machina hotis was the pit fiend i dont need to remind you i should remind the audience  matt the rakshasa  brian im like matt if you dont remember let me mattsplain something to you  matt incorrectly  brain wait wasnt hotis the  laura the rakshasa  brian 
none	 goddamn it wait what was the pit fiends name  matt utugash  brian utugash ill turn in my notice matt what was the plan for hotis the rakshasa  assuming vm hadnt ended him would have have shown up in the final arc or would he have been  left as a lingering threat for the next campaign  matt he wouldnt have been a lingering threat for the next campaign the rakshasas bent on  vengeance towards the one that killed him otherwise it goes about their own business their  own plans and plots so hotis would 
none	 have eventually acknowledged at the end by the time  hotis wouldve come back the campaign wouldve been over so it would have been a postcredits  scene if you will where his vengeance against vax cannot be acquired because hes no longer  around it would instead turn towards ashley towards pike  travs as grog no you cant  laura good thing shes so powerful she wouldve taken him down no problem  marisha were bosses by that point  matt hotis at this point knows what hes up against and would not just go up against you 
none	 by  himself a rakshasa upon realizing what you can do especially if you killed him once or twice is  going to instead go after the people you care about im glad it worked out the way it is it  made for a better end point that would have been a recurring nightmare for pike until she dealt  with it once and for all as was  liam followup question did tova live  matt youve already asked this question  liam but it was in a bear context  matt it was in a bear context 
none	 yeah tova lived  brian honey heist is canon we already established that  matt tova did live the only reason tova survived is because of the ring of invisibility it was just  enough of a tool to enable her to get around the smaller dangers and avoid the bigger ones that  could see through invisibility and find a way out unfortunately she didnt recover any of her  allies but she survived  brian sam question for you from hakumennarukami you mentioned before that tary  was only meant to stay for a couple of sessions when 
none	 was scanlan meant to come back before the one  year break  sam no idea i assumed it would be a two or three episode dalliance and that everyone would grow  tired of taryon and he would die probably he was pretty weak then id have to figure out a way to  get scanlan back but turns out taryon was so dashingly charming that everyone fell in love with  him instantly  liam those three episodes was how long it took for us to chill the hell out  sam there was no finite plan for 
town	 how to bring scanlan back right he went to go do his thing  matt i wasnt sure how long you wanted that to be we had just discussed his  sam we discussed his goals so when he went back to ankharel he went for revenge matt explained  to me that he didnt just get revenge right away he had to lie in wait for those two guys who  wronged him to come back into town eventually plot and figure out a way to destroy them in some  way so he took their counterfeiter away from 
town	 them and ruined their business shamed them created  this meat man character to shame them and intimidate them in front of all the underworld and  chased them out of town forever we had to roll for all this stuff too  matt yeah we did a whole series of rolls to see about successes and failures by the end you had  their counterfeiter you knew their underground and there was a power vacuum in this small scale  of what business they were running  sam i had been sitting there waiting for them for months and 
none	 months  matt i asked you what you wanted to do and you said  sam i guess ill just stay  matt ill invite kaylie and the two of us will take over the business thats where that  happened it naturally went that direction  sam it was a fun year  marisha what kind of a counterfeiter like a money counterfeiter  sam furniture art pieces antiques  matt expensive antique furniture things that youd sell to the upper lordship  marisha thats right i do recall that yeah  sam fine art pieces  marisha yeah 
none	 thats crazy  taliesin peter otoole  brian peter otoole  taliesin thats what i think of when i think of highclass counterfeit art  marisha yeah sure  brian matt save us from taliesin with an answer to this question from forsakengrundle is there  anything the soulstones from dis could have been used for  matt the soulstones from dis other than the quick high and perhaps the ingestion of one right  before battle giving a temporary advantage to initiative maybe not really theyre not  designed as sustenance for human beings the benefits are generally gained 
none	 by devils and  entities that can subsist and gain power from souls its a whole different ball game but for  these chuckleheads in dis it basically meant you got a brief headrush and realized you devoured  something once living  laura i still have one in my inventory  matt for one of those special nights  laura yeah  taliesin what would happen if a tiefling ate one would that change things  matt might be a stronger brief headrush  taliesin curious  brian taliesin jacob thomas bush wants to know there was a moment 
none	 after percy used the scrying  eye that felt like he wanted to kill scanlan but vex talked him out of it if she didnt intervene  what wouldve happened  taliesin im happy to answer he wouldnt have killed him he was going to find him again under  the rules of this world i understand how this works sneak in cripple him take all of his  stuff and tell him never to come back again i was not happy with him having a vestige i knew that  he had taken shit from the house and i 
none	 wanted to send a message that we were not happy i didnt  feel that he was responsible enough to have a lot of the stuff he had i wouldve just snuck in  kneecapped him taken his stuff and say dont come back  travis use your words  taliesin that wouldve been the end i was ready  brian so what youre saying is you didnt really have much of a plan in mind  taliesin i didnt have any plan in mind  liam neutral good folks neutral good  brian travis save yourself from your own 
none	 crippling boredom with an answer to this question  from melzy89 grog has come close to finding lady love or at least infatuation on a number of  occasions do you consider any of the women grog encountered the one that got away  travis no  sam and liam follow up  brian please  sam did you boink the nymph  all chanting nymph  travis so the only people in the room that know the answer to this is matt and i and the answer  is no  gasping  travis i didnt no she was 
none	 very genuine in the conversation we had grog was super meek when  confronted with this super hot naked nymph creature  matt it was suggestive a little bit i remember she pushed you onto this slab and straddled you  and you were like whats going on  marisha yeah well call that suggestive  matt it was her bequeathing the heart to him  laura yeah thats what you do you straddle somebody when you give them your heart  matt it was ceremonial from her perspective but it was also trying to make travis uncomfortable  as 
none	 im describing this to him in his kitchen  travis he has gentle tendencies underneath i think he just wanted to let you guys wonder for  five years  matt yeah nothing happened  liam grog did or travis did  travis whats the difference  brian question for anyone that this might be applicable to from tiamatzx were there any other  small things that the group did together on their year off that have not yet been revealed did  everything pretty much come out  travis i think it came out during previous talks and the 
none	 show  taliesin the only thing was the eloping and that eventually came out  laura we didnt talk about how we broke up we broke up and then got back together and then we  got married  brian youre that couple  laura yeah  liam how was the wedding  laura it was very private  taliesin it was quiet and personal  laura trinket was there  liam where was it  laura it was in front of the sun tree  taliesin this is right  marisha was it really  sam were there any 
none	 witnesses  travis i was there because im super important  laughter  brian matt deralpi wants to know what were the consequences of being caught listening to theatre  in the feywild  matt ah okay if you are found to be listening to the theatre and you are not a member of the  theatre they converge on you and make you a member  laura they kill you  matt they pull your soul to join the theatre which means you either have to flee or fail to  flee and become a member of the theatre 
none	 begin as an audience member and the longer youre there  eventually youre pulled into one of the various performances or troupes that cycle through there  brian the phantom of vox machina  laura so everybody that was there got caught  matt got caught or was a spirit that eventually wandered into the theatre and found a home there  marisha exactly like getting taft hartleyed is what youre saying  matt essentially yeah you must join after your third show  brian speaking of everyones third favorite couple laura  taliesin tfallenangelt wants  to know can 
none	 you share with us the marriage proposal who asked who  how why did you not  tell vox machina who married you was it pike and did tary know  laura oh how did we say this happened i think it was we were out on a walk and then we were  talking about marriage  taliesin the whole notion was very punk rock from the top to the bottom i think it was also a god  i do not want to be a couple like your brother was a big part of it lets not be 
none	 your brother  and keyleth at all  laura lets just do it lets just go for it yeah  taliesin i thought it was a good reflection of life is complicated and we could die at any  moment  laura it was very spur of the moment its not like  there was a proposal and then we had a whole thing it was  like should we do this lets fucking do this and then we did it  brian who performed the ceremony  matt the taldorei vegas wedding  laura did we say you asked 
none	 as a joke or i asked you as a joke and the other said yes  taliesin yes it was like i doubledog dare you and  laura we should probably get married then huh  taliesin its just doing it then huh  laura yeah  brian who performed the ceremony  taliesin was it the priest from im trying to remember  liam taliesin jaffe  taliesin i marry everybody to be fair  brian did tary know was the last question  laura no tary knew before anybody else did though because he was in the house 
none	  brian he was there okay  liam oof  laura yeah sorry bro  liam probably one of the biggest heartbreaks of the entire campaign massive if circumstances had  been anything other than they were he would not have known what to do with himself there was just  too much going on massive heartbreak  laura you were going to get told  sam doesnt it warm your heart to know that tary knew and could give her the support she needed  taliesin oh wow  laura yeah everybodys going to hate me now  brian 
none	 now sam snickerdoodle65 asks was scanlan close enough to hear pike with the earring  whenever she tried to talk to him  sam she was always in whitestone right  matt i think you were too far out of range  sam i got out of there fast well i spent some time in the  matt you spent some time in the turst fields but even that was too far the range on the earrings  is like 1000 feet  sam yeah so no never heard pike but scanlan did do a fair amount of praying to 
none	 sarenrae while  he was on his aramente  brian thats hilarious matt this is a really interesting question from heididobson2 after  the year break it was said that no one found scanlan when they searched for him how many  actually found him but had modify memory cast on them  matt none he didnt want to be found and there were a few attempts i asked you guys this when we  were over the break and everyone said nope if he wants to do his thing let him do his thing  laura not everybody ashley 
none	 really tried  sam yeah  matt thats right ashley really tried  travis and i really tried  matt the two of you went to try and find him youre right thank you for correcting me on that the  two of you unfortunately didnt know where to go didnt know what to look for  travis i dont know why were a bunch of big brains  matt youd expected him to still be nearby or on taldorei you asked in emon you asked in  westruun you looked around for any sort of sign but he was 
none	 in marquet the whole time so there was  no chance of finding him  travis what a dick  taliesin i tried to tail him briefly  matt you did  sam he was doing awesome stuff  laura making fucking forfeit counterfeit furniture  sam he was making money  liam he was reconnecting with his daughter no  sam sure that was part of it  taliesin did scanlan ever shoot the gun  sam he shot the gun once  taliesin that was the only time  sam yeah  taliesin he just had it  
none	 marisha i dont think you gave him any bullets  sam i had 15 bullets  taliesin he had 15 oh then technically shot but not bullets you had 15  sam he never had cause to shoot the gun  taliesin did you just pose in the mirror with it and try to look cool with a towel like a cape  brian commissioned paintings with him holding it in different poses hanging up over the fireplace  laura as a gnome wouldnt it have been a twohanded weapon for him  taliesin ooh  brian he has another 
none	 one of those doesnt he  liam shouldermounted  brian liam talatag has a question for you what would vaxs reaction have been had he found out  about vex and percys wedding before everything went down with vecna and the raven queen deal after  vex herself had specifically told him not to get married in secret  liam wait go through it again you lost me  brian what would vaxs reaction have been had he found out about vex and percys wedding before  everything went down with vecna and the raven queen deal after vex herself 
none	 had specifically  told him not to get married in secret basically telling you not to do the exact thing that she  ended up doing  laura i dont even remember telling you not to get married  liam i super hardcore remember it hardcore remember it  marisha so were back to the wedding  brian do you think he would have said you hypocrite or it would have been i understand  why you had to do this  liam he wouldve done neither of those he just would have asked why  brian seems very vax 
none	 of him to do  marisha it all hit at a really inopportune time  laura it was a bad time for all of it to come out  marisha if anything its kind of what you said about you guys not wanting to be like your brother  and keyleth i mean it kind of paid off in the end it ultimately is a good lesson fuck it  dont wait if you love somebody dont wait go marry them tell them you never know what could  happen let them know  matt after a responsible period of 
none	 time  marisha yeah dont be like creepy about it  sam the first time you think you want to marry someone you should definitely marry them  liam it would have been different even though laura doesnt remember it if she had not so  specifically said dont go off to zephrah and get married without me there i know but i do  and factored it into all of my thinking what am i supposed to do  brian those statements happen so often its hard to keep track marisha futureshocking wants to  know at the temple 
dung	 of melora after burying senokirs wifes ashes it seemed like they really  wanted their spire of conflux back given that at the time the chroma conclave was defeated did  keyleth ever consider handing it over  marisha you know i thought about it but nah we worked really hard for that  liam loot drop  marisha its mine it would be better used in my hands ruling my people than in a museum  somewhere  taliesin it tied the outfit together  laura it really did it looked so good  marisha i know anyway i 
none	 did think about after the arc had ended and we were talking about what  we were going to if i was going to go back to meloras temple and give the staff back then i  was like nah i just like it too much really pulls the whole voice of the tempest thing  together  brian it makes the art even better ashley question from legotti would you have wanted to  play an evil pike had her familys tales of the curse been true what were you expecting through  this bit of story  ashley 
none	 that would have been very fun that goes back to all of us giving matt a little kernel of  something and him taking it with his amazing storytelling i just knew that my family was going  to be tricksters and thieves and that whole thing hence the last name i didnt know any of that was  going to happen obviously but i would have gone with it if it would have happened that would have  been fun to see an evil pike  marisha its kind of crazy because at that point in time it seemed 
none	 like all of the ghost stories  that we had been dealing with were real and then hers yours wasnt  taliesin scoobydooed so hard  laura yeah we were scoobydooed  ashley we were very scoobydooed  brian ash how does it feel to be on a pedestal right where you belong that was a question from  brianwfoster our last two questions for this are matt first up for you alwayzb but they  dont say what to always be i dont know what to always be always be closing if sam hadnt  rolled so well using 
none	 his fate die no less to convince lord darrington to back down how did you  see things going  matt not well for the darrington family the way it had gone back and forth leading up to that  final roll if he had rolled poorly and didnt have that die roll or that die roll rolled poorly  that would have been the end of the family unit it would have been an unfixable divide between him  and his father he would have been probably cast out of the house indefinitely his mother would  have had 
none	 to choose between it would have just sundered the whole family  sam im a loner doty  matt it would have made for a very different and a very interesting story arc for taryon at that  point and then the honestly that might have been more of an opportunity for him to stay with  vox machina if he wanted to  sam theres still a chance guys to take him back  matt yeah for a little while longer at the very least because he didnt have a family to try  and help right the story 
none	 for i was really worried for him i had forgotten about the fate die at  that point and when you rolled so poorly i was like shit there it is and then you had just  won the battle royale and got that die and i was like well that if you cant you cant call  it a fate die more than that fucking moment that was ridiculous  laura can i ask you a question that does have nothing to do with that but the fate die kind of  reminded me of it  matt mmhmm 
none	  laura did you have plans for the hag cashing in the favor from vax  matt i did but by the time it had come around to where i was planning to maybe pull it in other  story threads were prominent in the front and it just would have made things messy  travis his life was already fucked  matt yeah the way things had gone a hag who liked to play with fate and toy with the soul of  another but when that soul already belongs to the goddess who is the goddess of fate 
none	 and the  transition of death the hag can sense that and be like nah im good  sam she doesnt want her 75 gold  matt yeah no at that point it was like okay i invested poorly im going to cut my losses and run  brian its what im going to do after this show travis roadrunner032 wants to know how long  did it take for grog to get truly angry with scanlan for leaving would he have been as angry  if lionel was not a barbarian as well  travis no i was not 
none	 mad at or grog was not mad at scanlan until he came back with the  illusion and the wearing the disguise and everything it was instantaneous rage from pike  and i a that he had to pretend b we had been worried about him and then c brought this  jackass that was like a halforc imitation of grog an idiot a barbarian and grog had the  biggest jealousy issue of all time i was ready to pick scanlan up and just smash his brain into  jelly and just paint on the wall  brian what 
none	 would you have painted what phrase or perhaps image  sam he cant spell  travis yeah i dont know anything just noisy crying tears  brian it would have been use the code mumbles yeah never mind  all critrole  brian use the code hearthstone okay our final round of critrolestats for the vox machina  campaign is most cast spell per character i want you to guess what your most cast spell was  that you did so keyleth well start with you  marisha my most cast spell  brian yeah you cast it 43 times 
none	  marisha call lightning  brian close transport via plants scanlan 47 times you cast which spell  sam bigbys hand  brian healing word  sam oh thats a spell thats right i am the healer of the group  brian percy 27 times you cast this  taliesin i already know but i knew going in hex i only have three spells  brian i know but you still had a one in three chance of guessing right and you did correct  vex 80 times you cast what  laura i would go hunters mark but i 
none	 think its pass without a trace  brian you are incorrect it is hunters mark with 80  sam you cant even get that hunters mark right  brian you couldnt even remember that  laura i really thought it was pass without a trace  brian vax 25 times you did what  liam smite doesnt count because its not a spell  travis luck  brian no luck would have been the tens of thousands  liam bless  brian close lay on hands  liam lay on hands is not really a spell its like a feature 
none	  matt its an ability well let it slide  brian pike can you guess 40 times you cast what  ashley guiding bolt up the butt  sam that is the full name of the spell  brian that is correct  laura from here on out its guiding bolt up the butt  brian nope cure wounds up the butt cure all the up the butt wounds  matt i would hope it would be cure wounds as a cleric  ashley me too  brian grog 18 times  travis i cast something  brian you cast 
none	 something via the titanstone knuckles  travis oh enlarge thank you  brian as if he needed it  travis i forgot yeah i had a spell  brian thats all the time we have there we go thats all the time we have to discuss jesus  christ thats all the time we have to discuss jesus christ thats all the time we have to  discuss the adventures of taryon darrington our fifth and final arc dives deep into the reality  that with great power comes great enemies with ramifications that shook the very foundations of  
dung	 their world in episodes 100 through 115 vox machina made their way into perhaps the darkest  dungeon they would ever face the mind of vecna coming up next  musical crescendo  all right our questions for the  final arc of vox machinas journey begin with you matt as we always do question from alwayzb i  guess the end of that is always be asking matt questions how many other gods could vox machina  have talked to related how many trammels or boons were possible to get  matt possible from each deity they reached out 
none	 to they could have acquired a seed or a spark  that could be created into a trammel but they went to all the gods they knew were closest to  them those were the fast tracks to the ones that would have the closest connection and the easiest  most finetuned challenges to what youre able to do other deities that you didnt have a strong  connection to youd have to research what theyre about where they are how to get there and then  each one of those experiences would have been a much longer protracted and 
none	 challenging endeavor  thats more time that would have added to the progression of vecnas power if you had gone to a  fourth deity there probably wouldnt be a vasselheim standing vecna would have performed  the miracle would have begun to understand  abilities beyond the avatar form if youd gone to  two more trammels the expansion of power would have gone past the ocean into taldorei and  marquet i had a scaling element to his power based on how many things you went for had you  gone beyond those core deities that you already 
town	 had connections with it was going to get more  challenging down the road  travis we did good  laura it was a scaling sort of thing  matt it was a good balance you guys got the ones that were close quickly and then went there  before things got too out of hand  brian sam nuclearwhale94 wants to know why did scanlan choose ankharel to go back to we know he  got scammed out of some gold but why did he stay longer than just long enough to get his revenge  sam as i 
none	 said in the previous segment it took some time to get his revenge those guys who  wronged him did not live there they were traveling assholes he had to sit and wait as he  sat and waited he got used to living there and got a little taste for the power the crime power  taste of furniture  brian whats it taste like  sam it tastes like pleather  brian ashley question for you from baylaust was there a specific moment when pikes feelings  for scanlan began changing if so what was it that made 
none	 her reconsider  ashley yeah i think it well i dont think i know a lot of it started in the letter even in  our home games i think the two of us would flirt a little bit sorry babe  brian i dont give a shit you think i view that as competition look at this beard and then look  at that beard thats all i have to say  liam i have a name how dare you  taliesin that was so good  brian i love my life continue  ashley she didnt take it 
none	 very seriously because she didnt think that he was very serious about  it as you guys heard that letter is very intense when he left she realized how much she  cared for him and missed him when he came back he was different and a little bit more mature and  she thought the time had passed that is not so it was this slow climb after the letter  brian i could see that having an impact  sam brian when you write things ladies like it  brian i wouldnt know man not much of a 
none	 words guy myself matt question from brooke casey  where did vecna keep his phylactery  matt i know where no one else is going to fucking know that thats not campaign  information thats world lore information  brian hes right behind you is it on the bottom does it say hes right over your shoulder we did  that on purpose  matt that miniature is his phylactery no you have no idea brian foster and the internet you  dont know  brian laura tiamatzx wants to know did vex take the name de rolo after her 
none	 marriage  laura yeah  brian great matt msmaggie357 the titanstone knuckles vibrating seemed reminiscent of  mythcarver vibrating in the slave market battle what were the knuckles trying to tell grog  matt a couple of things they were resonating because they were close to the source of which  they were carved the earth titan that was raised is what the titanstone knuckles were forged from  the vibration when you got there was a key to that and a possible other key to tackling the conflict  with vecna because of the siege elements of it and 
none	 the resonation between it the gauntlets gave  a bonus in structural damage against the interior of the titan there were other ways to slow it if  you decided not to the stealth topside element you could also begin to damage around the legs  knee structures and cripple it from the inside that would have stopped the titan from moving it  would have been slowly regenerating but you would have slowed it down or stopped it for a period of  time that would have also notified all of thar amphala that you were there it would 
none	 have been an  upward fight through the armies there were benefits to all the different choices you made  but that was one option that you could have made  travis we didnt want to ring the dinner bell that was one thing we were trying to be as  stealthy as possible  matt the gauntlets were a nudge to that if you wanted to explore that the gauntlets could help you  travis interesting option though ooh  marisha that would have tapped us out by the time we would have gotten there  matt you couldve 
none	 been quick and let them bypass hide as they went past there were a lot of ways  you couldve tackled that  travis between that and the one if i had punched thordak in his jewel in his chest knowing that  would have shattered afterward i was like oh ive got to explore these things better  brian those were some awesome knuckles in the art too really beautiful  matt they really ran with that made it cooler than i ever imagined  brian looked like cooler infinity gauntlets taliesin  taliesin speaking of cooler infinity gauntlets 
dung	  brian yeah youre mine taliesin amun1221 wants to know was percy troubled by the escape of sylas  taliesin no  brian why  taliesin he had transferred a lot of his angst over that whole process to other people by that  point i feel certain that if he comes back we can deal with him we had ruined him already he  had shifted his anger and frustration at the world onto other people by that point  laura sylas has a pretty shit existence at this point which is nice  taliesin again it was never 
none	 about sylas on a certain weird level  liam delilah seemed like the brain  taliesin yeah  brian imagine being married to that conniving of a woman what must that be like i wonder  travis why are you looking at me  brian i wasnt i was looking right past you to our producer max matt question from  davidmomahoney could always use mo mahoney who was the death knight  matt oh actually this ties into what i answered earlier remember when i mentioned that delilah  had found one of vecnas laboratories and there was a 
none	 nameless servant there that had been keeping it  that was the servant as it grew closer to vecnas ascension this servant was rewarded for centuries  and centuries of undead vigilance looking over and keeping hidden these spaces in wildemount he  was elevated to death knight status and became one of the great warriors of vecnas return doesnt  even know his name hes been old and held in that space alone for so long that has no recollection  of the living life before and only understands its existence at the behest of vecna  laura harold 
none	 his name was harold  taliesin hes like the roommate from what we do in the shadows hes like the fourth roommate  matt kind of yeah totally  brian the one that stares in the basement thats a little too turnt yeah liam oateygoat  wants to know  liam and laura oateygoat  brian oateygoat is there anyone that you wish youd had time to say goodbye to before the raven  queen took you  liam oh thats a huge question  brian thats why i saved it for when your beard was at maximum growth  
none	 liam thank you for that consideration if he had a week to go on a tour and see people he would  have tried to make an awkward peace with his father he wouldve said goodbye to korren at that  point  sam the food corn  liam the band korn  brian he knew he would never again be able to listen to his korn cassettes  liam he listened to elvis costello thank you he wouldve said goodbye to his friend gilmore  everything was so quick his little sister he barely had any moment with before 
none	 he was gone i think  thats it these are the most important maybe im forgetting somebody but these are the most  important people in his life its his family 100 his family not even like this is my  family this my other this is his only family  brian damn straight marisha forsakengrundle has returned to us with a question  marisha and thank god he did  sam or she  brian or they i know theres no image attached for me to see how blessed of a person this must  be do you feel 
none	 keyleth was ready to lead her people by the end of the campaign  marisha yeah i think it still would have been a learning process getting into it but i think she  had made peace that she was ready to do that and retire from adventuring because she was pretty  exhausted by the end of that she was pretty done ready to move onto the next chapter in her life  brian heavy is the head who wears the antlers  marisha especially when they keep growing like jeez  brian i read that in a danielle 
none	 steel  marisha i will say when we cosplayed and did our opening title sequence and i was wearing those  things theres no practicality in that shit it was awful  laura those things were in the way  marisha they were always in the fucking way  brian some of the great keyleth cosplay they are even more extreme  marisha we all suffer as one impractical antlers  taliesin keyleth and loki cosplayers are really upset  brian all the hela cosplayers are going to be in on that too  marisha yeah i stabbed everyone that 
none	 day  brian at least once matt marionavalon wants to know did you know what sam had planned with  his level nine spell to save vax  matt vax you mean  brian thats what i said i said it very lazily  matt i knew that you had an inclination because you came to me and asked what can this spell  affect its such a broad spell i outlined some vague ideas its powerful because it has so many  things that it can do but there are limits to its power and what it can achieve 
none	 so its important  to consider timing scope specific words i knew that you had possible interest in using it i tried  not to outline too specifically and give you the space i knew it was a possibility but also its  a clutch spell for battle it has so many great uses i didnt know if it was going to show up at  all at that moment so when you said that as the counterspell in the final battle it hit me all  the conversations we had it all hit at once you can see it 
none	 on my face on the episode im just  like oh shit okay oh god yeah for some reason i knew that was a possibility but that  moment was when it hit me the ramifications of that choice and that moment its one of my  favorite moments of the game  sam me too it was great awful  brian sam i have to primer you this question may sound aggressive or perhaps its a little  rough but bear with me this is from cardamonelaw i understand what hes saying im  not saying he said it 
none	 fuckerdly scanlan went toetotoe with a god and between true polymorph  and wish can potentially do almost anything except save or bring back his friend how do you  imagine he it gets worse  marisha oh god  sam also youre ugly  brian no nothing nearly as  sam in real life the question is  brian how do you imagine he reconciles being both allpowerful yet completely powerless in his  retirement  sam i mean he cant reconcile i think he feels like it was a big opportunity lost and that he  ultimately failed 
none	 but probably as he gets to be in his older age and surrounded by people he loves  that he realizes that its okay to fail you dont have to succeed in everything to make a difference  in peoples lives who you care about hell just try to be a hero for his wife and his kid and  thats it he still might use wish every once in a while to see if maybe he can get a message to or  from old vax but i dont know if it ever works probably not  liam vax 
none	 would never see that as a failure never see scanlan as a failure  matt i imagine out of that standing guilt that a lot of stories a lot of tales told about the  deeds and memory of vaxildan and the great things he did i dont know  sam also i think part of his maturing process over the whole campaign was learning its okay not  to be the center of attention its okay not to be the best at everything its okay to just do what  you do if you do it for the right 
none	 reasons  brian i agree completely wow thats a much better answer than i was anticipating laura how  great is this question for matt this is from myrynorunshot what was on the opposite side of  entropis from the lab the party passed through  matt oh in the tower entropis the side you guys went up had the bodies the torturing devices and  such the opposite side you didnt go up had a bunch of ancient holy relics that had been  sundered and destroyed it was the research laboratory for the creation of the seed that 
none	  ascended vecna one side was the torture mutilation gathering of information from the  flesh the other side was the desecration destruction and tearing of information from ancient  relics past the two together is what eventually led to preparation for the ritual of seeding  which allowed his ascension  marisha wait which side did we go up  matt there were two sides to the tower  marisha yeah which one of the  matt you went up the side where you found the bodies and the torture devices you saw familiar faces  marisha the other 
none	 one would have been the relics okay  sam for next time  taliesin temple run  brian taliesin cat1832 wants to know what were you originally envisioning for percys ending  taliesin percy was going to save vax percy was going to make a deal at the last minute and sell  his soul get the punishment he felt he deserved eventually when death came even though he  understood that that contract would go horribly wrong he wouldve convinced himself that it  didnt matter where he went when he died anyway he was of the impression im 
none	 going somewhere  awful already why not get something out of it  and then once doubt crept in it became that weird moment of what am i doing with my life  and why am i making all these poor decisions i dont know how i lied to myself to convince myself  that was going to work but somehow it worked  matt to be fair if you had called in the last part of the contract and been granted the wish if  it was carefully placed you couldve found a way to alter or adjust it 
none	 because the deal hadnt been  closed the same way that scanlan was going to but once again at the cost of your own personal  soul i dont know its interesting that moment for percival that whole sequence leading up to  and after that was my favorite percival moment  taliesin i was not okay for days after that  matt i watched you break it was wonderful  taliesin it was rough  liam also to both of those questions if either of them had tried to get the wish spell off i  dont even know 
none	 how it would have played out its complicated because in my mind as a player the  only way i was going to live is if the raven queen said you pass the test go live be happy and  have a handful of years that was the only way in my mind  brian did any part of you anticipate that happening  liam no i thought it was a 5 chance  brian so youre saying theres a chance travis were close to the end here aegisofages wants  to know what was grog thinking about when he 
none	 decided to seek an education  travis oh i think he just wanted to get smarter  brian thats pretty good matt phoenixheart815 what was syldors reaction to vaxs death  matt grief though they were estranged for many years he regrets the treatment of his two twin  children and has been spending a large part of his life thereafter trying to reconcile the choices he made  as a father to them beyond the grief and sadness there theres a lot of pride in the things that  hes learning that his son accomplished and his twin daughter 
none	 has continued to go into hes learned a  lot of lessons about the issues in syngorns society and acceptance of other races cultures  hes doing the best he can within his own lower political position to try and influence future  generations and politics between the nations to be a little more open  brian yeah on a related note laura from glorairokicki did vexs relationship with her  father change after she saved veloras life  laura yeah thats one of the things that we talked about later in life they made peace with  each other 
none	 she worked to rebuild that relationship that came from having five kids with  percy and going oh this is what family means this is what having children means it suddenly  became very important in a different way to reach out to syldor  brian yeah our final round here this is from zeldacrfan what happened with vax and the  raven queen after his death did he keep her company as she once mentioned or did he simply  have a peaceful afterlife  matt i dont want to answer too much of this because i like to 
none	 leave the ethereal essence of  these questions to interpretation i think a little bit of both as part of that process vax  was able to reconnect with the spirit of his mother even if temporarily or occasionally but  also as was decided and discussed between the two of them prevent an element of loneliness in that  transition for her the small section of mortal self that she maintains takes solace in keeping  the champions close ever watching and doing the work she needs i dont want to go any deeper than  that because i 
none	 dont think i need to  brian i understand also cardamonelaw wanted to know was there any other means of stopping the  titan other than binding and slaying vecna  matt that was one of the things we mentioned earlier the titanstone gauntlets destroying it from the  inside hobbling it from the interior those were really the only means that would have functioned  the exterior was too powerful it could only be damaged from the inside its serious business  brian wow titans are no joke our last few questions are perhaps the most potent marisha  
none	 brandiefree wants to know would keyleth ever cast speak with animals on the large raven that  visits her every day  marisha i think she wouldve hesitantly tried yeah i dont know if she wouldve gotten the  results that wouldve wanted which is why she would even be so tentative to doing it in the  first place almost better to keep the illusion it for sure is vax than the confirmation that it  might not be at all  brian what if you did and it was like im gary  marisha totally i was like 
none	 oh fuck you bird  travis its been 300 years  marisha yeah i think she might eventually but i dont think she would right away  laura im gary  matt i like your hair  marisha feed me  sam i come everyday because you feed me  marisha aww  brian man what a beautiful answer travis xarkost wants to know what were the final  contents of the bag of holding  travis oh man there was a shitload of silverware there were some candles stones i had a  shitload of caltrops and handcuffs  
none	 laura dried poo in there  travis yeah the dried poo disc broke though i had a nice solid cow frisbee patty there was  some armor the big black sapphire i gave to scanlan to get married to old pikeypoo with a  shitload of expensiveass bottles of wine basically a bunch of other random shit it was  like a bustedup home depot at the end percy probably couldve made something from it all i  was just randomly collecting shit  liam singing and a troll dick in some mage robes  laura forever i have the 
none	 kevdak skin in the bag of colding just a big piece of skin  travis theres 10000 pieces of platinum in the bag  laura shut  brian liam f3ntin wants to know how does vax feel about his ending is he a little bit bitter  about how soon it was or is he only concerned for his friends and accepts his fate gladly  liam in the final moments i dont think theres an answer for after this is similar mystery is  better but in the last moments no he was not bitter it was very heavy 
none	 he felt very full as  well and knew that his sister was taken care of  laughter  brian she lived to annoy you  liam i dont know what to say  brian i get it yeah ashley this brings us to perhaps our mostasked question for this entire  wrapup episode ifthenanderson was the lucky person got their version of the question chosen  who was pikes other love interest and how did she come to reconcile those emotions with her  ultimate choice of extremely settling for scanlan  ashley well for a very long time 
none	 it was percy i think that  marisha get it getting all the vox machina ladies all three of us  ashley i think she saw through her faith and the light that she carried within her that he was a  marked man she could see the weight on his shoulders and the darkness that he carried with  him she did so much thinking and praying for his soul i think all of that time spent on him was  confusing to her obviously it never wouldve worked but in the end it was always scanlan i  
dung	 think there was some time there where she was a little taken by the dark side  matt she wanted to fix him  taliesin way to dodge a bullet there ashley he was oblivious man  sam even taryon fell in love with that guy  laura true what the fuck  sam everybody loves percy and hes like the worst  matt dont let anyone ever say that humans arent a good race to choose in dd because youre going to get  all the folks up on you  taliesin percy didnt have a fucking clue either 
none	 last to know anything  brian just a clueless teenage asshole our final question of the night my favorite could really  not have come from a better screen name and that is the pragmaticbeaver thank you whoever you are  out there this is for everyone to answer we dont have to go in order if you feel compelled  if you think of something just answer when your characters look back at their time as world  renowned adventurers what memories stand out the most as moments they will never forget  travis dropping on kevdak from the 
tavern	 necklace bar none  liam saying goodbye  marisha yeah cherry blossoms in the tree in the voice of the tempest ceremony  liam cows  laura oh cows  marisha god so many  laura talking to trinket for the first time  sam trying to kill trinket for the first time  liam gilmore stabbing me  laura flying fucking flying  marisha the hanging tree that one stuck with me  taliesin letting go when ripley shot me actually on the other end of that realizing that  percy was in love with vex was pretty impressive 
none	 ive never had that kind of pc character  interaction before that was a strange moment  brian matt some moments for you that youre going to remember beyond however many other games you  play or even this next adventure  matt everything theyve mentioned here and so many more its hard to pick it really is  theres so many  marisha they feel like real memories  matt they do they are  travis they are  matt its the magic of this  sam i always figured scanlan would tell their stories or whatever and he 
none	 will and hell try to  and everything but i thought about this actually while we were playing for him anyway  it was not the epic stories of glory and saving the world he would have liked just impressing his  friends and healing them or inspiring them just the friendship that was his favorite moments from  the epic journey  taliesin eventually you produce a raphiphop show based off of our adventures its a huge hit  marisha remember the cannonball competition in the pool that was great  liam vax was pretty impressed i was pretty 
none	 impressed in that last fight when we realized  youd been fighting with your hand tied behind your back the whole time saving that spell  sam i almost did it too  laura scanlan was pretty impressive the whole fricking time lets be honest  taliesin your fight in whitestone was pretty intense  matt can i say as a man who grew up playing dungeons  dragons and continuously being told  that bards were the worst class and that charisma was a fucking dump stat and fighting that because  i knew the potential for storytelling with 
none	 that kind of a character even though older editions  didnt do them service theyve done better as theyve gotten out im so thankful that you  stepped up to the challenge of the worst character and worst race and shown just how  amazing it can be  travis hear hear  sam well i will do the opposite in the next campaign  brian ashley any memories that stick out to you  ashley its all just a little bit more personal i think it goes back to my first game that  changed my life  travis 
none	 yeah  matt it changed all our lives dramatically i mean we have this family now  brian yeah indeed and an extended one too matt im interested from your perspective having  some of these people never even touched dd before and here we are at the end of this thing  and not only are they moderate to lowlevel okay dd players but to see how theyve woven story and  character and improv and the dd system five years later and at the end of this arc of these  characters you must be not only proud 
none	 but just excited to continue on now that to some extent  most of them outside of sam know what theyre doing now  matt its true its weird its very strange to look at myself as a 35 year old man who has spent  his entire life trying desperately to do something with his life and to genuinely believe that the  greatest thing ive accomplished is with you guys in this i mean thats the truth thats the  truth i am so proud and so happy to have been part of this with you guys and 
none	 we get to make a  new one soon  travis we get to go back to the beginning  brian i will end with a sentiment that might sound cliché but ive been thinking for weeks  and trying to sum up my feelings in some way about this whole thing only coming in ive been with  it since the beginning but coming into it in an official capacity a year ago and halfway through  the thing has been incredible and i will leave you with the words my grandfather used to say  which sounds so 
none	 cliché but he used to say when god closes a door  he opens a new campaign january 11th  and that is all the time we have  laughter  brian for this wrap up of vox machinas adventures make sure to tune in to our very  special critmas episode of talks machina this tuesday night at 700pm pacific thank you to  everyone who submitted questions everyone whos watched thank you to our wonderful cast our  guest stars our crew thank you crew so many wonderful people and most of all you the  community we
