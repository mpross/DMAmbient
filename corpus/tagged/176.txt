dung	 wind that have burrowed this small  walkway through these big cliffsides you turn around the corner and you can see immediately  about a dozen or so dotted lights in the distance the dark maybe a quartermile away there borg  goes that there thats where he is thats where urgram and the tark have been preparing  laura is the bright lord down there  matt maybe  sam how do we get inside  matt i dont know ive only had to go outside of it  darin youve never been inside  matt oh well ive

none	 its toward the bottom  darin oh 14  matt all right some decent rolls all around okay you guys can see on the other side of this  wide valley where the torchlights encircle a fenced walled encampment a single ramshackle  watchtower marks the center of the interior of this large sharpened pikelike wall the back  half of the wall is buttressed against the mountain base across the valley from you  vanishing into a large cavern so its not a full encirclement you see the wall encircles around  the base of the mountain and each 
none	 side ends at the mountain theres an actual natural cavern that  the base of it hides in shadow  laura thats a nice camp theyve got a real nice camp  travis location location location  sam but do they have grog  travis i hope  matt you had the 22 you also hear faintly off in the distance this snuffling and growling  youve heard this sound before its kept you up at night whenever the caragors in their cages  were particularly rambunctious it sounds like a caragor as soon as you hear it you also 
none	 hear a  alert yelp a second one not far from it goes snuffling  laura theres caragors  matt yeah but like near you maybe 40 feet from you at the moment  travis are there trees around us  matt no trees youre in mordor right now  travis yep just thought id ask you know some ashen trees  matt i mean there are jagged rocks part of the terrain itself is a series of broken shale and  large rock faces that jut out of the ground from seismic activity  laura should we hide behind 
none	 rocks its caragors  travis you hear caragors  laura yeah like real bigsounding ones  travis prepare to fight and i hide  matt okay make a stealth check  sam hide no we should sneak past them  travis thats true we should 16  matt okay so you watch as skak disappears behind a rock what are you guys doing  laura i also try to duck behind a rock  sam are we going to sit here  laura im going to duck behind a rock and wait for one to show its face around a 
none	 rock and then  im going to hit it with my maul  matt okay make a stealth check with disadvantage  sam why dont we try to go past them  laura seven  matt okay you watch as arby nods follows suit right behind where skak is the rocks almost the  size of arby so you see this outline of arby clutching this rock and trying to act quiet as the  armor clanking  travis look and see if we can make it past them you stick your head out  sam all right i will 
none	 stealthily see if i can see any caragors move out look around  matt make a stealth check  sam ooh 25  laura sneaky sneaky  matt as you climb a little bit of the rock face on one side of this pathway thats carved into the  mountain base here you glance up you can see the faint bit of moonlight that breaks through one of  the nearby clouds you can see the outer rim of two fullygrown caragors that are currently  walking maybe 15 feet from each other a dual hunting scenario theyre both like 
none	 sniffing and  grunting on the ground and theyre smelling for any sort of possible prey that might be in the  vicinity  sam hi we need to distract them somehow does anyone have any meat on them  laura no but i have a bell  sam a bell  laura yeah  sam that would distract  laura well its a bell it makes noise  matt bell clanging the bell is now ringing in her hand  sam throw the bell  laura i throw the bell as far away as i can  matt the 
none	 caragors at this point snarling they both go jumping and leaping in toward where the  source of the bell sound was  laura i throw the bell  matt make a strength check  travis oh my god please throw it a mile  laura 18  matt the bell arcs behind where you guys were  laura oh wait no 15 because its not a saving throw  matt right it arcs off behind you and you watch as one large caragor nearly 15 feet from end to  end leaps from the top of the cliff down 
none	 into the ravine behind you the rock ravine where you  were and pounces on right where the bell landed you hear it ping crushing with an impact you  see rocks get thrown as it scrapes across the ground and it tears where the sound source was it  sits there tearing at it the other one comes right up to the edge to inspect inside right over  where you are it hasnt quite noticed you right now as you guys are all standing still the bell  is quickly being noticed to not be anything fleshy  
none	 laura i look up is it like right above the head  matt its about maybe five feet above you right now  laura so i could take my maul and go like this  matt sure  travis i could use mage hand to create a better distraction  laura too late  travis yeah  matt go ahead and roll an attack you have advantage on this strike since its unaware of  your position  laura 26  matt 26 hits yeah  laura laughing aw 11  matt 11 points of damage nice so as the 
none	 one that its snout kind of creeped over the edge  you can see its teeth are this thick underbite of its jaw pulling open as its trying to take in  the air both through its nose and its mouth snarling at which point out of the darkness  this giant maul head slams right into its snout and it backs up briefly and as that happens and  you pull the maul back it glances down with this look of absolute hatred and death in its eyes  roars  laura i think it saw us  matt 
none	 you do get a second attack because you did take the action on this one and at this point  the other one spins around from where the bell was hearing the pained sound of its ally  laura 17  matt 17 hits  laura yes 12  matt 12 points of damage all righty so as its gearing up over the side you take the maul and  slam it again this time it moves its head to the side and it hits the side of its neck its a  heavy hit and it takes the brunt 
none	 of it but its so big i mean youre pretty big as an  ologhai its probably at least two or more times the mass of your body  laura oh its so much bigger than i thought it was  travis i think you were thinking it was like a dog  sam oh because you didnt play an orc in the game so you dont know that these things are  really powerful  laura no  travis really terrible  darin but they can be defeated by a bell  travis its like a giant liger  
none	 matt and on that note i would like everybody to roll initiative please as these two caragor are  now bearing down on you in this ravine oh okay  laura we got more of them than they have its okay  darin 17  matt oh nice  sam i think we should try to run  matt laughs yeah these guys dont seem very fast  sam six  laura oh no  travis yeah only fourlegged  laura nine  travis greyhounds of death 15  matt all right mozuu youre up first theres the one thats 
none	 up behind you on the path maybe  about 15 20 feet from you and theres the one thats right above the edge right now that she  slammed twice in the face what are you going to do  darin thunderous smite  matt all right so you pull forth your war pick and youre going to go ahead and strike which one  darin the one that was closest to arby  matt okay  darin or i should go for the other one  matt its a little high for you right now because of her size 
none	 she can barely reach it  youd have to try and make your way up either arby or climb part of the cliff side up to you  darin do you mind if i climb you  laura not a bit  darin im going to climb  matt make an athletics check  darin okay  sam thats either a one or a 20  darin i dont know what that is  sam its a 20  darin oh its a 20  matt oh snap okay so using arbys body as a ramp you begin to leap 
none	 up from shoulder to back  to shoulder the top of her head and jump in the air warpick in the sky as you scream to bring it  bearing down on the first caragor before you  darin yelling i speak for sauron  matt laughs all righty so make an attack roll against it  darin 16  matt 16 hits go ahead and roll for this  darin i think its a 1d8 plus three  matt so yes 1d8 plus three and then you add an additional 2d6 thunder damage to the target  darin thats 
dung	 eight and the six that is three and that is a one 12  matt 12 points of damage  darin yeah  matt all right so as you slam the war pick right into the front of its snout it jams into  one nostril and tears through across the side of its face releasing this gout of dark purplishred  blood and as the impact hits theres a burst of energy the sheer force of your anger as you  scream in its face scares it back and it blows about ten feet behind you and is knocked 
none	 prone it  rolled a natural four plus four thats eight and i believe your spell dc is 11 right  darin yes it is oh yeah  matt this caragor now gets thrown back ten feet and is knocked prone on the ground on its side  its trying to snap around and get its feet any sort of purchase to get back up on to the ground  but currently its open  darin the forcs are a powerful team  travis we dont forc around  matt that ends your turn okay so skak youre up  
none	 travis skak because its laying prone i probably cant see it from below right  matt no youd have get up  travis ill aim to the other one that turned at the sound of pain and i will use my crossbow to  shoot at it  matt all right go for it it just turned around growls  travis thats terrible 12  matt 12 okay that does not hit you turn around and you fire and it  travis whimpers bonus action hide  matt ill let you move around the rock where you are and try 
none	 and hide  travis okay fair enough 18 on stealth  matt okay good to know all right that ends your turn its now their turn so the one that  was knocked prone gets up off the ground ten feet away it still has enough movement as youre  standing now on the shoulders of arby its going to go ahead and lets see  darin and we put on a big coat and pretend were one person and we sneak into a movie theatre  matt it takes a fivefoot step back and goes into a 15foot leap 
none	 right towards you its a deadly  leap snarls it lunges towards you  darin mmhmm this was a wonderful game thank you for letting me play  matt yeah i need both mozuu and arby to make strength or dexterity saving throw your choice  travis get its attention you can do it  darin thats a 13  laura 25  matt you succeed you do not all right so here we go  travis all the dice come out just all the dice  matt 14 points of bludgeoning and slashing damage to you mozuu and you 
none	 are knocked prone as it  lands on top of you knocking you off of arbys shoulders you are now on the ground with it on  top of you going snarls and its tearing and biting at you as you are currently pinned to the floor  darin hes trying to rip out my throat sure is poetic  matt turnabouts fair play you take seven points of damage arby and you are not knocked prone or  thrown off you manage to keep your weight there however its partially standing on you now its  hind legs are 
none	 up on your back and its using you to hold itself as its currently putting all of  its weight on mozuu the other one that was shot at by skak is going to go ahead and rush forward  and its going to go ahead and make a deadly leap as well lets see all that going on with that  space its going to have to go after eden i need you to go ahead and make a strength or dexterity  saving throw your choice  sam ill choose dexterity and thats a 21  matt 21 
none	 all right okay you take six points of bludgeoning and slashing damage together and you  are not knocked prone it doesnt pin you in the space you just manage to pull out of the way but  its right up in your face now and your backs against the rock that hes hiding behind theres  your friends and the other caragor right behind you over your shoulders and this one is right in  front of you right now slashing and snarling at you thats going to end their turn arby youre up  laura im going to 
none	 spin around and try to hit the one thats standing on me  matt okay thats the one youve hit before so go for it  laura yeah ooh 26  matt 26 hits  laura aw dang plus seven plus five is 12  matt all righty so that first hit slams into its side you hit it again you hear the crunch one  shoulder blade seems to almost buckle a little bit its looking pretty hurt but its still  standing there  laura im going to try to hit it again thats a 19  matt 
none	 that hits  laura 14  matt 14 all righty and with that you slam up your maul a second time it actually catches it  right underneath the jaw and forces its head to snap up so fast that its spine seems to break into  place and with a whines it falls limp the entirety of its weight sliding off of your  shoulders and onto mozuu who is now prone and pinned underneath it  darin ive gotten the most damage of this entire game  laura eden do you want me to try to hit that 
none	 one too  sam yes  laura im going to action surge and try to run up to the other one and attack it too  travis action surge  matt okay so taking a little bit there shoving it off to the side you rush up to the one thats  right in the face of eden its a quick jaunt  laura thats a 24  matt that hits  sam youre so powerful  travis wow  laura are you kidding me  travis double ones both times  matt what  laura sorry thats seven points 
none	 of damage  matt all right seven points of damage you rush up and swing at it this time it brings its head  back and manages to deflect some of the blow with the side of its face not quite doing as much  damage as youd like  laura ooh natural 20 on the next hit  matt make up for that there you go  laura 25 points of damage  matt 25 points of damage so while it deflects the first blow as it turns its head back to  strike at you you put your 
none	 foot up and hold it right in its jaw to keep it from getting away you  use that to aim it up and whack right up the side of its temple it rings its bell and you watch as  it pulls away the slobber and blood dripping from its jaws shaking its head back and forth from the  pain you just inflicted i believe that ends your turn  laura yes it does  matt end of arbys turn brings it to you eden  sam growling i will attack relentlessly 23 to hit  matt 23 
none	 hits  sam that is five points of damage  travis relentless damage  sam i will use my flurry of blows  matt you get two attacks and then you can use your flurry  sam got it so second attack doesnt hit its 12 so i cant use my flurry of blows  matt you can  sam okay flurry of blows  matt so you get two more attacks  sam thats worse and 15  matt 15 just barely hits  sam eight plus four is 12 points of damage plus i will choose a condition 
none	 for it strength saving  throw if it fails no it probably is strong its probably dextrous too im going to choose  that it cant take reactions until the end of my next turn  matt so it cant take attacks of opportunity there you go perfect that ends your turn eden  mozuu youre up currently prone and pinned under the dead body of a caragor  darin may i call for help  matt yes you may  darin i would like to do that you thought i was going to say something else but i would

none	 matt 26 points of damage all right yeah as you peek out of hiding you see it snapping and  snarling at both of your friends over on the side you take a moment and slow your breathing heartbeats  and release the crossbow bolt you watch behind as it streaks forward between your friends  the caragor turns opening its jaw to snap over arby and it goes right in the back of the throat  up into the brain and it collapses to the ground no longer moving  travis oh are you okay mozuu  darin yes 
none	  laura and sam mozuu  darin i am a talking caragor  laura i walk over and try to push the caragor  matt since youre not in immediate danger it takes you a minute or so you all manage to push  this giant caragor corpse off of mozuus body youre sore youre crushed youre sweaty and  covered in blood but youre now standing  laura see that wasnt so bad  sam is our prisoner still around or did he run away  matt make a perception check  laura oh i forgot we even had

none	 a front actually for you guys that are closest go ahead and make a  perception check  travis yeah 17  matt all righty  sam nothing  laura five  darin nine  matt okay so as you all stare off and its about as much as you can make out you however skak  looking ahead you can see one theres a main entrance theres two large eightfootwide doors  that are currently closed on the north side of the wall you also see what happens to be a  muckcovered mud hole thats towards the south 
none	 side where the wall meets the mountain where you  can see its a little swampy and it looks like some of this thick muck and mud meets up to the  side of the wall there  travis so the doors lie ahead but i see off to the side a little quagmire  laura whats that  travis its like mucky muddier earth and liquid  laura oh we could take a bath  travis we could yes or we could see if perhaps theres a way under the wall  darin do you know what that is 
none	 have you been through there before  matt well ive seen it aye  darin have you ever seen anyone go in or out of there  matt not intentionally its the shrak hole  groaning  laura whats that  matt i could show you coughs its wrapping is all around the face and one eye it was already  swollen from earlier and is now hes a wreckedlooking goblin  laura what happened to your neck  matt i dont know  travis so we either go in through the front door  sam or the back door

none	 one of the unlit braziers youve  seen these before theyre used usually as a beacon a warning a signal for any sort of undue  sam lets go through the shrak hole right away fast charging in  laura you kill him  travis the guy walking towards the brazier yeah but there are three longbows above us and we have  the low ground  sam thats why we have to go through the shrak hole as fast as we can  laura kill him so he doesnt light it then we go into the poop  travis 
none	 okay i eye the guy walking with the torch towards the brazier does he look like he intends  to light said brazier  matt he looks like he intends to light it  travis i will draw very quickly the crossbow and try and put one in while hes not looking  matt go ahead and roll for an attack  travis rolling with sneak attack  sam how high is the wall matt  laura is it a surprise attack  matt no it is not a surprise attack its probably about 15 feet high  travis but

none	 of them is going to fire at  you actually theyre both going to fire at you because you killed their friend you revealed  yourself they suck though thats an 11  travis that will miss  matt yeah and a ten  travis that misses as well  matt so you duck out on both sides and they both go for secondary arrows and begin running towards  the brazier themselves now what are you guys doing  laura oh no you should hit them too because theyre going to light it  sam im going to jump 
none	 up onto the wall  laura can you do that  sam im going to use my step of the wind which doubles my jump distance distance does that mean  height  matt well yeah but horizontal distance well say height for this whats your strength  modifier  sam four one my strength modifier is one  matt right it doubles it so you get grunts ill say you barely because of your height  because you are an olog you barely get your fingers up on the top go ahead and make a  strength saving throw 
none	 to try and pull yourself up  sam okay scoffs nine  matt you drop back down its just too high  laura are there any rocks around  matt make an investigation check if you want to  darin we did take a rest did we regain any spells we use  matt no its a long rest  laura 12  matt a 12 you find a small rock in your hand its really small  laura im going to try to throw this little rock at one of them  matt make an attack roll laughs

none	 im going to go in the shrak hole  laura im going to pick up the body of the guy that fell and try to throw him at the other guy  matt make an attack roll  laura yeah im big  matt this is just your strength modifier youre not proficient in bodies  travis laughs body chuckings not a thing  laura eight  matt eight laughs you slam it against the wall it slides down and hits the ground you hear  this horrible crunching sound as a number of previously unbroken bones are now freshly 
none	 broken  in the dead body you have another attack if you want to walk up and try it again  laura i want to try it again but this time since i didnt throw him high enough im going to spin  around and try to lob him up yeah  matt okay make another attack roll with a crumpled body  laura laughs thats terrible seven  matt you release a little too early and it heavy impact hits the wall right next to you one of  the arms tears and flies off against the mud you 
none	 liquefied his insides at this point  laura hes not feeling very good  travis are we going into the shrak hole  sam im going into the shrak hole  laura how big is the shrak hole can all of us fit in there  matt well as you dive in it pushes you out the other side you get shoved out plopped out  covered in shrak and you look around immediately you can see as you wipe your eyes off the  shrak everybody is now starting to look around at the signal and begin to grab 
none	 their weapons and  start preparing for an incursion you dive into it you get halfway in this is a very small  space underneath and youre a very large olog im going to need you to make either an athletics  check or an acrobatics check to try and push through your choice  sam acrobatics 19  matt 19 you push through and watch as the bottom of the wall splinters and breaks but you manage  to make your way through and now you stand up behind mozuu a good number of feet taller than  him 
none	 also covered in shrak and you both now look around at this chaos happening what are you  doing  laura well go in skak  travis no yes and i jump in i jump in after him in the shrak hole  matt all right you dive in the space has been opened thankfully you follow through they paved  the path  travis oh i could barely make it through so big  matt you glide through and now its just you and your friend borg whos looking at the archers  well the archers the one thats 
none	 with the torch is going to go ahead and try and take another  shot theyre both taking a shot ones going to be at you and ones going to be at you now that  you guys are on that side against you that is a 21  travis hits  matt you take ooh nine points of piercing damage  travis uncanny dodge no i already used my reaction  matt well you used it from last time so it returns so you have it back again you can use  it yeah okay its reduced to four 
none	 points of piercing damage and then one against you is a  14  laura doesnt hit me  matt it breaks off the armor theyre both firing arrows down at you all right so what are you  guys doing you glide underneath as they fire at you you slip under youre back there with borg  laura im telling borg to go through before me go on  matt dives in like slowly wades into it groans and goes under and pushes his way through without  an issue  laura all right im going to gingerly lower 
town	 myself into the shrak and then go under slowly  matt okay as you guys get up on the other side you can now see about 40 to 50 various uruk have  now gathered at the base of the wall where youre standing theyre all armored and ready their  weapons are drawn and you are completely surrounded on the interior of this wall nothing  but liquid shrak at your back as you all stand there but theyre all keeping at bay you watch as  a hand comes up behind the crowd and goes hold everyone was 
none	 like they are ready to tear  at you but they begin to part at the center and you watch with heavy steps as an ologhai  approaches with a giant mutated underbite with tusks that reach up past the nostril the eyes  peek through from heavily scarred muscle tissue where a face once existed but has since been torn  and not healed very well over you see clutching a giant greataxe in its grasp what you assume to  be urgram the faceeater whos approached and goes who who enters my home  darin the bright lord 
none	 called to us  matt make a deception check  darin 15  matt the bright lord you say  darin yes  matt then stand at me walk up and prove you bear the mark  darin i bear no mark yet i desire to ive literally gone through shrak for this moment  the bright lord spoke to me in my head he told me the strong take what they want and i want to  be part of the bright lords army  matt at this point you see urgram is taken aback by this response and 
dung	 glances over his  shoulders he steps back and you hear a voice from behind him go let me see this orc bring him  before me and as urgram steps aside you see a human male standing with long somewhattattered  dark hair beard towards the base of the chin wearing leather and hide armor and bits of  chainmail beneath a dark cloak with a single long blade extended to one side all the rest of the  various uruks around the area separate and back away as they do you see a familiar flash in  their 
none	 eyes that strange graywhite light that you saw when you first had your fortress attacked the  human man walks forward you say you came this far for the bright lord then come stand before  me be marked as you say your request  laura whispering mozuu mozuu  sam whispering hes been chosen  darin i walk towards the bright lord i kneel before the bright lord i am mozuu the chosen  choose me bright lord  matt as he looks down upon this snivelling uruk his hand protrudes forward and you see for a  second 
none	 the outer image of his form begin to shimmer and for a moment you see a familiar sight  youve only seen towards the outskirts of the dead waste and swamps on the western side of mordor  you see spiritual energy pull out of him and you see for a brief instant a wraithlike form of  some longdead elf that marks the exterior of his body as the hand reaches forward this voice  echoes around come may you join the rest of this army takes the hand and places it against  the side of mozuus face 
none	  laura i scream out no and run forward and try to tackle him manswine  laughter  matt i need you all to roll initiative right now  travis oh crap oh crap oh crap  darin thats really something  laura oh shrak oh shrak oh shrak  darin so much for that idea  matt okay you rolled a 12 initiative  darin yeah  matt all right so we have  sam nine here  matt all righty  laura 18  matt oh wow you are dead even with the tark  travis 16 for

none	 20  matt 20 okay yep contested against athletics or acrobatics all righty weirdly enough you  manage to get in fast enough your large ologhai form heavy footsteps and slam with your shoulder  into this tark he goes flying off spinning in the air and landing barely catching himself as he  skids back about ten feet or so looks up at you and still the wraith form is on the outside the  eyes flash with this vibrant scary white light and the wraith form fits back into the body as the  tark stands to his 
none	 feet the blade at his side and goes very well so youve chosen death  laura shouting death  laughter  matt all right so you still have another attack if you want to take it  laura okay i want to keep attacking him i dont know which dice to use though okay 26  matt 26 hits  laura shouting manfilth 14  matt laughs 14 points of damage nice all right so as you hit him you hear a ringing out  behind him the voice of the faceeater himself urgram says gravewalker smash the invaders  
none	 travis oh jeez  laura were all going to die  laughter  travis theres only 40 of them 40 or 50  matt all right so at this point the gravewalker  whos now up in front of you takes the hit and  glares back at you with the burning white eyes hes going to go ahead and make two strikes on you  with urfael his sword that is a 21  laura that hits me  matt and that is seven points of slashing damage and 19  laura ugh that also hits  matt that
