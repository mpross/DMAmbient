much about football in my entire life as i do right now  which is saying i dont necessarily care a lot but definitely  laura more than it was  travis everybody send sam a tweet hes going to be crying at the outset of his team sam a moment  of silence  taliesin i think hes lighting the set on fire  laura sam walked away so he wouldnt be on the same set as you were saying that  matt anyone else have anything they want to talk about /none/ before we jump into the game  taliesin no announcements until i get back i think  matt all righty that being the case then lets go ahead and hop into tonights episode of  critical role  dramatic music  matt hello and welcome back so to get you guys caught up our band of adventurers vox machina  in raising an army hopefully of allies and powerful artifacts to face the chroma conclave a  gathering of powerful dangerous chromatic dragons that have been tearing through the countryside of  taldorei and distant wildemount they have recently found /none/ some information had a close call  with the frigid doom known as vorugal the white dragon flyover did not pierce through the  illusionary barrier that was placed with the help of allura gilmore and pike there in whitestone  you then decided to go ahead and using that cue before the dragon returned to its current roost  that it has created over the ruins of the city of draconia you traveled across to the continent of  wildemount  you had a meeting with the ravenites a rather subverted longenslaved offshoot species of  dragonborn kin tailless /none/ and now surviving amongst a recent winter that seems to have come with the  ruin the dragon brought you also discovered that most of draconia and its royal elite have  been slaughtered as a means of the dragon establishing its dominance and the worship of the  ravenites that survived the fall of draconia  you made a deal with tooma the current clan leader of the remaining ravenites that you would  aid in destroying this dragon basically the master that they replaced the draconians with when  it came however to ensure your help there was /none/ a twoweek time limit and if you do not return  before then they would see you as not keeping your end of the deal and they would then instead  direct the dragon towards what was going to be whitestone until you altered her memory which she  recalls now as emon  anyway before you could be finding your way home one of the corpses upon one of the ice spire  spikes outside of the dragons new nest percy saw to be the remains of your longtraveled friend  tiberius stormwind the party had a fateful farewell /none/ set him to rest within the ruins of the  nearby library fallen from the islands of draconia said your goodbyes and then upon  prepping a bit plotting and planning found your way back to whitestone to continue the next leg of  your adventure  and that is where we begin you have now taken some time in your own respective rooms its still  late afternoon going into dusk you all took some time to yourselves within castle whitestone to  take a short rest and ruminate over these recent events and reveals the evening sun draws /none/ close to  dusk it is your choice which you wish to do if you wish to spend the evening resting here and  then leaving first thing in the morning that is up to you  liam taking the initiative this one came to my room then inside i think weve probably been  quiet for a while staring at the ceiling and after a while finally say weve really fucked  things up havent we  marisha in which particular way do you mean aside from all of them  liam i need to tell you i know /none/ with all thats happened between my new patron and my sister  pretending to gag literally every time we attempt to share a word together and mostly my own being  fucked up in the head for weeks now that ive pushed all of you away you most of all because  ive been afraid you would im sorry and you didnt deserve any of that keyleth i need you to  know through all of that everything nothing has changed  about how i weve had so many nearmisses and now  finding tiberius death is unavoidable and its /none/ all the more reason for life to be lived and it  doesnt matter to me what this is what we call it if you are willing to spend some time any  time with me then i will simply count myself lucky to have it youre very dear to me  marisha youre talking too much its not like ive made myself very accessible either its not  on you it might be a little on you but its on both of us anyway my point is for the longest  time i was terrified that i was going /none/ to lose you first to death and then to the raven queen  which is still kind of like death and then ultimately to yourself and then i had an interesting talk with  pike recently and she said something that really stood out to me and that was that some people  just have more of themselves to give and i realized this whole time that i was afraid of  losing you to a future that ultimately has not yet been written which is stupid  liam maybe so  marisha but youre ultimately right we have nothing /none/ to lose i love you vax and im sorry  for being me that it took me this long to say it  liam sniffles im sorry  marisha yeah me too  liam i love you thats pretty fucking great  marisha that is pretty great yeah high five yeah  liam i tackle her into a bit of a hug into the bed  laura oh  liam were already on the bed  marisha and thats it for now  sam pan to the fireplace  travis laughing pan to the fireplace  matt all right so /none/ vox machina taking your time to mourn in your own interesting ways what is  your path of action what is your course going forward  liam sleeping in  marisha bacon  laura yeah i think we need to spend at least the night in whitestone and get up in the morning  matt okay so youve all spent the majority of it in your respective rooms most of you in your  respective rooms figuring out where you are as a person and where this story leads you after an  evenings rest the next morning comes around /none/ breakfast is already prepared by the servants in  the castle though maybe not the amount of bacon you were hoping and easily rectified upon  request its at your disposal there is a tension in the city the barrier remains up  as youre having breakfast you can see zahra wander in at the smell of bacon glances over the  rest of you still holding a book at her side that she slams closed oh im glad to see youre all  right and youre safe please tell me theres more bacon  travis not for long  /none/ laura theres more coming dear  travis what she said  matt she comes and sits down and spends breakfast with you guys catching up on what has transpired  and what your current plan of action is  taliesin zahra it occurs to me you come from a family with power connections  matt kind of lets just say were estranged at the moment  taliesin well were looking for any ally we could and we were curious if  matt you will find no allies where youre asking believe me id be happy to offer if we  /none/ could but no  taliesin i had a feeling it just felt worth asking  matt its all right im going to continue with my research since the rest of the ziggurat clan  are now scattered about or maintaining that barrier guess who has to do the research in the  meantime and she rolls her sleeves up you can see the slightly smudged dirt across her reddish  skin shes been hard at work digging around trying to figure out what the basis of this  enchantment beneath the city still is  laura sorry you cant be /none/ out having your fun dear  matt im certain time will allow me at some point it better im going a little stircrazy  she grabs the bacon from the table and walks out of the room  taliesin is kashaw around by any chance as well  matt im sorry what  taliesin kashaw is kashaw around  matt i havent seen him for a couple days ive been underground most of the time  taliesin yes of course we have to send a letter to the slayers take at some point that should  happen sooner rather than /none/ later  marisha trying to wrangle a beast  taliesin trying to wrangle a beast or seeing if they know of anything thats in the vicinity that  we can at least feed to it in the meantime  laura maybe we can stop through on our way back we are going to marquet arent we  taliesin i would hope so  marisha and whats our intent in marquet to get the next vestige  taliesin to get to the next vestige and to perhaps make some friends the more the merrier  liam and the means of travel /none/ is  taliesin we have a sigil we can teleport  laura gilmore gilmores from marquet  taliesin this is a teleport sigil this is not going to require his attention  marisha yeah its located in whitestone castle correct the teleport sigil  matt its actually a sigil by memory that he has and its a spell that he casts its not a  permanent fixture in the city  taliesin so we need him but he can do it  sam yeah but hes concentrating on the defensive wall right now  laura its up as long as /none/ the dragons not here and attacking  matt its a renewal feature he has to spend some time each day maintaining it hes not stuck there  the whole time  sam that would be awesome  taliesin the worst job in whitestone  sam before we go to marquet lets say marquet takes 13 days  taliesin thats an awful long time  sam i agree but lets say it does do we know what were doing with regards to draconia when we  come back do we have some sort of a plan were getting a beast thats /none/ all we know  travis yep weve got it covered its planned out to a t  laura how are we even going to get a beast  taliesin talk to the slayers take and see what is already on the continent  sam what constitutes a beast because me and keyleth can make some beasts  laura i think a large enough beast to attract vorugal  sam like a triceratops  taliesin no  marisha they said it hunted something really intense recently  laura he said they hunted remorhaz  marisha yeah they went to the ocean /none/  sam what is that  matt roll an intelligence check  marisha but i wrote it down  sam for me ooh a 19 plus two  matt thats what they look like  laura oh those are big and scary  sam is it a gargantuan monster  matt theyre huge most definitely theyre nasty they burrow the actual blood within their  body is heated to such a degree that even to be in a scuffle with it is to scar yourself with flame  and heat  sam and it was bored with that  taliesin /none/ we want to find a creature that would threaten a mediumsized city  marisha so it wants competition  taliesin we want to wear it down a bit before we go in for the attack we want it to be breathing  heavily  sam and how are we going to get this creature there  taliesin were going to find something thats already on the continent  laura and vorugal will go to the creature  taliesin he will be happy to attack it  travis can you put it in your necklace  sam on the continent what /none/ continent the draconian continent  taliesin yes  sam so we have to go back there to search  marisha the slayers take should know theyve got contracts everywhere  sam all right this is slightly a better plan than i thought  marisha we thought about it a little  taliesin six people cannot wage a war  sam then we should go talk to the slayers take now so they can get started on this hunt  taliesin were going to send them a letter  sam a letter  taliesin yes  sam whos the letter carrier /none/ and hows he going to get out of this city thats protected by an  invisible wall  taliesin were going to make kashaw take the letter  liam when we were last there hadnt they talked about a brass or bronze dragon but there are  brass dragons as you well know  laura i know because im an expert  liam is that overkill wed have to convince a dragon not capture a dragon  taliesin it would probably kill the dragon  marisha wait are we talking about capturing another dragon to fight another dragon  sam /none/ no were talking about convincing a dragon to go fight this dragon that would clearly kill it  taliesin i was going to find kashaw and see if he would run the letter to the slayers take and be  our emissary and convince them to do this so that were not doing everything ourselves  sam wait is there anyone else who can make this message delivery faster or safer  taliesin literally everyone if we could find a child in a pub who could take it  sam no but faster and safer  taliesin kashaw is possibly /none/ slower than a child  marisha no more small boys percy no more  laura we could ask zahra but shes busy with research  travis i think kashaw is a great peopleperson  taliesin just to get rid of him they would say yes  sam all right  liam he wants to help he does  laura yeah lets go find kashaw  matt you guys head outside of castle whitestone not far from the base of the pathway into the  actual city you can see there is a series of neweroutfitted guards they are people being /none/  trained in the force of combat you can see that theres definitely a rampingup of the defense  force for whitestone as a precaution  marisha do they look like townspeople  matt many of them look ablebodied and people that are strong and fit but they do appear to be  civilians that have had to take up the cause just in case  marisha any kids  matt no kids no they all look to be at least of strapping age to be carrying a weapon  sam strapping boys  taliesin strapping the strapping age  /none/ laura did we ever talk to cassandra or anyone else about starting an alarm system here  sam yeah and they were working on it already werent they  taliesin no they started they are working on it now  sam i think its done taliesin id buy that yes it was proposed  marisha i do want to maybe talk to gilmore though  taliesin well were going to have to if we leave the city anyway  matt as you are watching the group go through their different weapon practice moments theyre  breaking off into small sparring /none/ groups and theyre going up against ramshackle built  training dummies there are a few that are doing forms in succession grunts you know the deal  you do see on the opposite end that the person who is currently helming one section of the training  is kashaw you can see a bunch of shield and spear fighters right now and hes basically giving them  instruction on how to use a shield defensively and the spear offensively simultaneously  laura maybe hes not the best messenger if hes training our armies  taliesin this is not an army /none/ this is something for the population to do while they pass time the  dragon shows up theyre all going to die no matter how many times they learn how to put the  spear forward  marisha as cynical as percy is being right now hes right  laura all right  marisha but it doesnt mean that kashaw is going to think that its any less important and im  sure he might not take it as a compliment if we ask him to be the messenger boy  sam its an incredibly important mission  laura its /none/ not just a messenger its defeating a dragon  taliesin and its convincing the slayers take to join  sam the slayers take if i recall doesnt do things for free were going to have to pay for  this even though were members  taliesin were going to have to bring them some dragon parts  laura no we take a contract on a really large creature and then we let the dragon do the work  for us we get the best of both worlds  taliesin ooh thats very clever  sam we take a contract on /none/ an existing creature that we have to somehow find in draconia  travis no we bring the dragon to the creature  sam how  laura he hunts them thats what he does  sam not transcontinentally  travis you cant broker a fight between a huge beast and a white dragon  taliesin we could sell tickets  travis i think youve done better  liam we dont necessarily have to sacrifice a dragon were fighting a war here theyre fuckers  sam no were not talking about sacrificing a dragon were talking about finding a beast  liam /none/ well im talking about a dragon couldnt we try to talk a dragon into helping us do what  were doing theyre not all evil are they theyre not  marisha yeah but do we know of any other dragons here  laura well then were going to have to fucking go to the slayers take  travis can we go somewhere in the next 60 seconds  laura thisll be great  marisha lets talk to kashaw we go up and we talk to kashaw  matt as you approach you see him leaning in with younger early twentieslooking /none/ men a bit  scrawny theyre still armored the helmet looks a little lopsided kashaws like youre not  supposed to put the shield away sighs oh wonderful take five take 30 so youre alive  thats great im excited what can i do for you  taliesin kashaw how would you like to be anywhere else other than here right now  matt depends on where and what youd have me doing  taliesin thats exactly the sort of enthusiasm i was hoping for we have need of an emissary to the  slayers take we need to convince /none/ them to help us kill the next dragon  laura and vanessa really likes you  taliesin she does  marisha we need a big beast on draconia  matt so youre saying that i go back to frozenass vasselheim to deliver a paper message  to the headmistress whom already i am so happy to be away from  marisha yeah see  matt he glances over at the rest of the soldiers yeah ill take it  laughter  laura thank you  taliesin we are in your debt ill have the paper drawn up and anything you /none/ can do to put the  weight of the situation behind us and make sure they know how clear it is and how necessary this  is and how desperate we are  matt ill do my best to muster some semblance of emphasis  taliesin and well figure out ways to make sure theres money in it for them or at least dragon parts  matt all right give me a list of what youve got to offer ill bring it to them  taliesin excellent  sam what do we got to offer  liam we dont have /none/ the troll dick anymore thats gone  laura we have 40 pounds of dragonhide black dragonhide  taliesin and white dragonhide  laura we dont have white dragonhide  taliesin we have white scales  travis we have 64 pounds of scales from me we have four claws left  sam i have a tome of leadership worth 30000 gold  laura no thats keyleths remember in the next century when shes still living  sam well get it back before 100 years are up  marisha ill lend it to them for 100 years  sam a 99year lease /none/  travis and we got umber hulk pieces too  taliesin mostly i was thinking of also offering them whatever we can take from the dragon itself  once its destroyed  liam i was about to say yeah we put into the contract that it has the remains of the beast we  take down which we will take down  taliesin we keep some scales we keep some teeth we split it  liam sure as a souvenir right yes  marisha were basically doing a contract for free  liam its a very large creature  sam /none/ thats provided we kill it if we lose they get nothing im just saying from their  perspective were offering them literally nothing  marisha if they lose they dont lose anything either right  laura no they do they lose a contract  marisha but wouldnt the contract just go right back into cycle  laura no if the dragon kills the creature and then we all die and we cant harvest it the slayers  take doesnt have anything from its previous contract  liam but that could happen with any contract any band of idiots could go /none/ die on the battlefield  marisha theyre used to having people die  laura well fuck it  marisha i think grogs getting antsy  taliesin i like this im going to have it drawn up  liam i look at grog and see hes really bored i pick up a wooden sword and i hit him as hard as i  can on the small of his back  travis yes  matt make a check  liam its not going to be that hard  laura while all this is going on grog you could be training these /none/ soldiers  liam 17  travis what train them  matt as youre having this conversation whack right in the knee cap a surprisingly painful  and forceful blow its less the strength behind it and more the precision in which it strikes you  right between the kneecap and the rest of the lower half of your knee  travis like when a doctor hits you and your knee jumps  matt yeah and youre like grunts and you glance over and you see vax hide a wooden sword  quickly behind him as he backs away  liam /none/ come on big guy i know youre bored come on i hit him again  matt roll a strength check actually this time its an attack roll as well  marisha hit him in the nuts  liam okay cool thats a 20 oh but its with a stick just strength modifier  matt youre not proficient with a sword  liam oh dear im going to use luck 14  matt laughs you whack him this time it hits the meat of his thigh and has no effect  liam i missed the nut ugh come on  travis /none/ do you have a death wish  liam come on take a swing im trying to do you a favor come on get it out  travis what am i missing here  taliesin im seeing this going down ive walked away  liam i see a gauntlet on a table and i throw it at his face  matt okay roll an attack roll  liam its a one  laughter  sam i see this going on and i stand up on something and i yell to the students  matt before this happens as youre getting up /none/ you watch as vax rears back and as he throws it  yelps he pulls a muscle in his shoulder and it drops to the ground and youre like  pained noises  laura seriously  sam i jump up on a chair and i yell to the students instructor kashaw has instructed us that  this is a drill you are to attack that man right there that large man as a test of your strength  and training now  laura dont kill them grog  matt make a persuasion check  taliesin oh this is going to /none/ be awful wow that is cruel  sam 34  laughter  matt you watch as roughly 45 armored soldiers all turn towards you with their shields and spears  and freeze they all slowly look towards scanlan and whisper among themselves then look back at  grog and stay frozen and two creep forward for a minute get a little closer  travis i take the gauntlets and i smash them together and i grow in size  laughter  matt as your form swells into your now enlarged goliath battleready form you notice a few of  them /none/ start giving off this rattling metal sound as their armored knees clanging together many of  them step back about ten feet and kashaw who hasnt left entirely spins around and goes the  gnomes fucking with you its fine he walks up to you scanlan pats your arm and goes that was  pretty funny  sam i try  matt dont get the people killed ive been working on them for four days  sam he wasnt going to kill were you going to kill them grog  travis yes  sam oh shit  travis i look /none/ at vax and i go you were just playing around right  liam yes  travis and in my giant state im going to kick him like a soccer ball  liam im going to dodge uncanny dodge man  matt well well see go ahead and roll an attack roll  travis thats good 32  liam ooh no i didnt miss that  matt roll a strength check  liam wait im going to use another luck and make him roll again and pick the lower of the two  matt okay  travis 15 on the strength /none/ check 25  liam got to roll again for the hit  matt roll again because he used a luck point to force you to reroll your attack roll  travis 24  liam that hits  matt what was the strength roll again  travis the strength was 24  matt strength check was 24 so as you peek out of the corner of your eye you hear this heavy steps  and as you try and spin and dodge out of the way instinctually  liam uncanny dodge  matt i know and well get to that instinctually /none/ you turn to dodge out of something grogsized not  giantsized and in that brief minute that you remember that he grew you pause just long enough  to whack feel the force of what feels like a giant battering ram slam into your side sending  you off your feet and arcing a good 30 feet before you impact tumble and skid to the ground whats  your strength modifier  travis seven  matt seven you take 14 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to half because youre taking  uncanny dodge so only seven points bludgeoning damage you /dung/ stay there for a second stunned you  feel a bit of bile and iron taste in the back of your throat  liam and in the distance you hear strained i feel so alive  laughter  taliesin first rule of fight club  travis can i check the titanstone knuckles have they changed now that ive kicked a friend in the face  matt laughing make an investigation check  travis damn it eight  matt they appear to have maintained their composure as gauntlets  liam theres some blood and five long dark hairs on them  /none/ matt you watch as a lot of the soldiers who had been watching this endeavor step even further away  from grog and some of them begin walking off taking their helmets off all right were done  laura hey bonus hes on our side eh thats encouraging  matt they all nod their heads yeah i know that thank god but theyre all doing this while  still locking eyes with him thats great and slowly walk off  travis chuckles  liam vex  laura yeah  liam help me up  laura dont you have wings  /none/ liam not going to use them right now just a hand groans thats going to bruise worth it  travis thank you i was getting so bored  liam sighs i know  travis thanks bubby  taliesin what are the chances i would have at least a basic portable writing desk theyre not  that complicated  matt a portable writing desk  taliesin 16th centurystyle just something to write on  marisha what do you need a writing desk for  taliesin just something with paper pen and something to write on  matt you have access to /none/ a quill and ink you have access to parchment  liam how about a fucking clipboard  taliesin its basically a fucking clipboard  matt you have access to that yes  liam percival de rolo inventor of clipboard  taliesin no it was called a writing desk back then it was called a writing desk theres a  thing it was that big and you put it on your lap it was a writing desk  matt all right yes you have access to that  sam so wait what is in this letter what are we offering them /none/  marisha yeah hows the letter going  taliesin im writing the letter up ive basically gotten it together ive explained the  situation briefly i assume theyre aware of the war and the current reality  sam and to clarify for me were asking them  taliesin im getting there in this im asking for their assistance in killing a dragon for  this assistance they will get all bounty of biological remnants of the dragon with a small  percentage of scales and teeth kept for us asking for 20 percent but negotiable we want them to  /none/ supply either a local or give some intel into where we can find a beast large enough for this  dragon to attack information that we have on this dragon so that they actually help us strategize  any ways of defeating it and any other help that they could give in defeating this creature and as a  token of our goodwill we are sending them a small package of black and white dragon scales and a  dragon tooth  laura yes and make sure to include that this must all be completed within 14 days  sam /none/ but wait  travis and taliesin theres more  sam asking them to help us kill a dragon  taliesin for stuff  sam no but thats not what were asking them were asking them to find a beast  laura yes thats what he said  taliesin its in the letter  laura thats part of that listening thing scanlan  sam im sorry  liam he did talk for quite a while  taliesin is there a way to enchant me so that i have his voice and then hell listen more closely  marisha yeah actually  /none/ matt he has a spell for that  laughter  taliesin dont answer that  matt as you finish penning the letter you read over it once twice make sure all the  information is contained you go ahead and grab the little bit of your offering of dragon scales  and teeth present them to kashaw he takes the letter and reads it over sure  sam should we add an nda  taliesin theres a rider at the end of everything i send  laura kashaw no mention of whitestone at all anywhere you go very important  /none/ travis good addendum whatever that word is  liam again please  laura and taliesin no mention of whitestone  laura do we have a way to get him there very quickly  marisha what kashaw  matt are you going to do your tree thing for me otherwise i can walk but itll be a month and a  half before i get to shore  marisha yeah were going to be here the rest of the day right  sam how will he get back

time on this  matt all right you guys make your way towards /none/ the building that has recently been essentially  given to and is acting as the abode for shaun gilmore while hes here in whitestone as you come  to the front door the doors closed you knock knocking no response  liam shaun shaun its us are you home  matt you hear a muffled voice in the distance within the building go yeah hold on  laura did it sound like anyone we knew  matt it sounded like gilmore hes under some sort of duress  marisha sounded like he was under duress  matt slightly  laura /none/ is everything okay  matt yes hold on please and you watch as the barrier flickers for a second and restores itself  almost like a wave of energy brought what was a slowly dwindling bit of the blue energy now  restored to its full strength  travis hes got to use the privy at some point  sam yeah hes probably squeezing one out its okay  matt a moment passes before the door opens again and you see gilmore there beads of sweat down the  front of his face hes got his fuzzy purpleblue robe wrapped /none/ around him my sincerest apologies  i had to take care of the now morning ritual  laura how are you holding up gilmore  matt im fine this is childs play compared to what youre having to deal with on a daily basis  im sure  marisha can i do an insight check  matt go for it  marisha 15  matt 15  laura oh you got a whisper on a 15  sam this is an early whisper a firsthour whisper is rare  taliesin it came at such a high speed i wish it /none/ came so quickly  liam i wish i knew more about loot crate right now  sam well its not just loot crate liam its loot wear those come in a separate bag  liam different than loot crate  sam yeah its different you can find out all about it at lootcratecomcriticalrole  laura actually the shirt youre wearing sam is from loot wear  sam what it is oh my god and im so handsome  taliesin anyway back to the game  matt what can i do for you  laura well we plan to go to /none/ marquet  things have progressed much quicker than we expected it to and unfortunately we are on a  twoweek time crunch before all hell breaks loose  matt well at the very least that gives us a series of days to make the best of the time we  have so marquet it is all right come in he closes his robe a little bit and walks in and you  enter you can see theres a halfdrunken tea set and he begins to walk past tea anyone  sam id like a looseleaf oolong please  matt ill /none/ do what i can  taliesin how many cups are currently sitting with the teapot  matt currently there is one cup but as he walks by he does this with his fingers and you watch as  multiple cups drift off the shelf and find their way cups landing on the table  laura how does his house look does it look together like it would normally be or does it  look disheveled at all  matt it looks a little disheveled but also it hasnt been too long since the assassination  attempt on him and he /none/ threw his attacker into the far wall but it looks like the furniture has been  placed up there are still some bits and pieces of broken things here and there but for the most  part it doesnt look like hes had lot of time to clean up other than just making it functional it  seems livable its not too bad  he goes into the kitchen he comes back out a moment later with a fresh pot of hot tea and sets it  down all right so this isnt going to send you to where youre /none/ going  sam we literally know nothing about marquet  matt its hot its dry bring some water if you can  liam youre not able to leave are you  matt i should not got to keep this going until allura comes back  sam is there anyone that we can say maybe vouches for us or someone who we are against so that we  can win favor with the locals something like a notail longtail binary  liam we walked into a sort of political snafu because we didnt know the lay of the land so is /none/  there anything we should know in advance  matt best i can tell you because i havent been there since i was very young one this going to  send you not to ankharel itself its going to send you to shandal which is a small oasis  village a little ways south of ankharel its where i grew up  liam what was that name again  matt shandal  liam shandal  matt i will say that it has been about 15 years so i dont quite know what to expect there i  apologize in advance /town/ for any ensuing chaos but its a nice town its small its sleepy its  not my speed hence why i came here however in marquet its mostly music culture fun people  good food dont break the laws dont drink the water freely from the various channels you may  stumble across water there is a commodity it is controlled and sold throughout the city  liam we got a jug  travis we got loads  matt those are the main things i can think of i dont know what else youre really looking for there  sam /none/ well i can tell you  taliesin cabals ruin  sam thank you  taliesin and marisha the den of druja  marisha druyah drujah  taliesin druhah  marisha jaja  taliesin thanks  matt i dont know anything about that unfortunately but most folks that have  information are eager to give what they know with a little coin to grease the palm  taliesin or a little water  matt depends on who youre talking to anything else  liam no go ahead  matt he pours tea for everyone else who asked for it and for /none/ each person that asked for a different  flavor of tea he begins to snap his fingers and the tea color changes  laura we are looking for a merchant warrior outside of you do you know of any very powerful merchants  matt there are many  laura one with a missing eye  matt that would definitely probably narrow it down but none that i can remember off the top of my head  sam why dont we bring jarett with us is that a thing  laura we should talk to him  sam okay shaun you /none/ do so much for us we do nothing for you is there anything we can bring  back for you or messages to give to someone there  liam is there anyone you havent seen in all these years  matt when you meet them and youll know who they are tell them i say hello and actually  he thinks to himself for a second rushes off comes back with a small backpack made of leather  and thick light tan wool he opens it up and reaches inside pulls out a small silver locket  and takes it /none/ and puts it in your hand vex he goes just give that to them  laura to them  matt he closes the bag and places it back in the other room  marisha shaun are you doing okay you look a little worn out  matt sighs we do what we must  marisha i could only imagine a barrier of this size of a construct can be quite taxing on ones  physical energy  matt yes i guess if i had one request of all of you this goes universally can we end this dragon  business /none/ soon please i really just want to set up shop again  liam we would like nothing more i think were on the same page  matt great  laura were very interested to start paying you for your service again gilmore and stop  expecting it for free  matt good because ive been keeping a tally i dont know about you guys but the tab is running  very deep  laura oh believe me i have as well this locket will take a nice little chunk off of that tally  matt fantastic i love it  /none/ liam birds of a feather you two  sam should we go talk to jarett and then come back  taliesin lets go talk to jarett well have appropriate clothing set up and prepare ourselves  for the trip  sam robes and things  matt ill be here if you need me  laura thank you  sam well be back in an hour  matt all right you dont want the rest of your tea  sam oh ill drink it  laura do you have any togo cups laughs just kidding  matt these didnt belong to /none/ me so please take them if you want  laughter  matt he transitions the tea over into a couple of cups and hands them off to you guys who havent  finished you head out as youre leaving you see sherri coming up her hairs a bit tattered shes  usually more put together when she runs the shop now shes in casual sherri mode her hair is  frazzled and pulled back her glasses are pushed to the end of her nose and shes carrying a  bundle of groceries various bits of produce and such oh hello /none/ everyone im bringing gilmore  his breakfast  liam sherri we asked him but hes modest hows he doing  matt not that hed tell me anything but he doesnt have a very lengthy period of keeping this  up without him probably collapsing like he did back in the city just please try to do your best to  get this over with im worried at the very least until allura comes back at least they can  share the load all right she knocks on the door and opens it gilmore gilmore breakfast the  door closes behind /none/ her  travis hey i have an idea  sam oh boy  travis i know its thrilling we need eight gallon wine skins or bottles or jugs  because the alchemy jug can make out eight gallons of fresh water we pour it all out and then at the  end of the day it starts over so we have eight gallons sitting in the bag  taliesin in theory we all have water skins dont we  marisha we should have a spread of our survival kits  liam but all the same that is a very good /none/ idea grog  laura im surprised you even know how many eight gallons is grog  travis yeah eight gallons  sam but if we had an extra skin or something we could trade it we could give it away so we  should go get one yeah  travis yeah we could give it away give it away give it away now  laura wow i walk off and look for jarett  liam a rift just opened in the universe  matt it doesnt take you long he is still stationed as one of the central figures guarding /none/  the actual castle of whitestone itself similar to the place you saw him last time you guys had a  conversation walking up to the castle he stands there with his crossbow at the ready giving a  long view over the surrounding valley before he watches you approach friends you have returned  i hope all is well on your end can i be of service  laura you can tell us all about where youre from actually did you leave marquet a long time ago  matt it was maybe ten nine years ago  and it /none/ was not under the best terms probably would be in jail had i not got away  laura oh really  matt they are not very forgiving of broken laws there and based on certain judgments lets  just say a slap on the wrist usually takes the wrist with it  laura what did you do  matt sighs whatever was needed for survival  liam well were going there so im hoping either you can give us a lot of tips so we dont  run into problems or i dont know if anyone can take your place /none/ right now do you want to go on a field trip  matt to ankharel  liam yeah  matt no  laughter  matt im sorry i respect this i think my strength and skill set is much better used here  than in the scarlet prison beneath the cerulean palace i do not want to even conjecture spending  the rest of my life there or in pieces also possible  liam forget it we need all the knowledge in your head in ours  marisha yeah what was that scarlet prison you just mentioned under the what /none/ now  matt the cerulean palace the cerulean palace is where the hand of ord generally keeps most  justice where most of the courts are kept it is also where the tower of jmon sa ord is maintained  for watching over the entire city and most of that eastern side of marquet the scarlet prison  is where people go to disappear it is also referred to as the scarlet oubliette people are  placed there to go away people are placed there to be tortured people are placed there rumors  say to be part of various /none/ experiments regardless i would highly recommend he looks  to you dont steal anything unless you are damn sure nobody knows of it  liam i havent stolen anything in years  travis coughing bullshit  laura me neither laughs nervously  marisha ive never stolen anything  laura have you heard about the den of drujah drujah  matt he closes his eyes a second that was a very very  laura its unscrupulous  taliesin it would have been in a tale of a oneeyed merchant  matt not any merchant i know but this den you speak /none/ of they were a rather serious gang running  rather violent activities in the city maybe 70 80 years ago  taliesin would they have been in the walls is it possible to be in the walls of ankharel  matt in the outer walls the outer walls are solid they are thick they are meant for defense  only i did not run with them i do not know anything it was before my time but they have not  been around for at the very least 50 years  laura all right  sam do you know who /none/ rules ankharel now  matt it is jmon sa ord  liam what can you tell us about him or her or it  matt jmon i have not seen jmon though i have heard the stories jmon brought the city together  400 years before when it began to grow expand when it became this great oasis long ago it went  into chaos and there were many who wished to utilize those who lived within the center desert  to be abused to be swindled to be enslaved  jmon started the hand of ord which was the /town/ peacekeepers and really brought the town of  ankharel into the grand city it is today not known to appear in public very often there are many  rumors that circulate some say that perhaps jmon is some godling an entity that has existed long  before ankharel and will exist long after  there is also and this is my personal belief i think jmon sa ord is many people i think jmon  is more of an office a station a title thats passed on from person to person because ive  heard referenced as a girl ive /none/ heard referenced as a boy  laura its like the man in black  liam what story is that  laura its this famous tale of the princess bride dont worry about it  sam does the hand of ord carry any symbol do you know of any way of identifying them  matt they carry ornate armor of a deep blue sapphire color and brass  liam brass  laura like the dragon  sam and this other city shumble humbal  laura and marisha shandal  matt shandal yes laughs its more of a podunk  laura a /town/ very small town  matt comparatively yes ankharel is immense shandal is usually a small stop in case camels or  other horses have died in transit as well as a small water stop on the way to the city  laura is it a long trek from there to the city  matt id say maybe a days travel  sam in which direction  matt it is to the southsouthwest of ankharel  liam on par with emon the city bigger smaller  matt oh emon comparable a bit bigger  laura wow shit  taliesin well make /none/ waves  marisha yeah maybe we shouldnt  taliesin well were going to have to get someones attention  marisha its a city that has no water we shouldnt make waves  laura do you remember in all your time there did you ever deal with this is completely  ridiculous a merchant who only had one eye  matt i dont recall ive met people missing many limbs and parts of their body kind of  happens it a dangerous place the deserts in marquet but there are also many people that live there  liam and youre sure /none/ we cant talk you into going percys giving out titles  taliesin i am absolutely not  matt i have no interest in titles i just wish to stay alive im sorry i am much more of use to  you here i assure you i would be a perpetually nervous paranoid wreck if i were to come with you  laura i cant even imagine you like that  matt good well keep it that way  marisha jarett was there still a control of water going on while you were there  matt yes for many long years /none/ yes the oasis is built around  marisha is there anything we should know about that  matt well most of its controlled in the river district a number of canals begin in the river  district this is where there is the spring the perpetual oasis that fuels the city and many of  the caravans that travel to and from  travis perpetual oasis  matt yes  travis source of power  laughter  sam good notetaking grog how do people greet each other there in ankharel is there a kords  strength be with you thing /none/  matt there is be pleased with a small bow preferably with the hand down towards the stomach  with the hand out be pleased  laura be pleased  travis beepbleep  liam bleepbleep yes no stealing got it  sam water is valuable  laura dont drink the water  liam is there anything thats offensive we dont want to offend anyone by accident  matt to be honest anything you do will offend somebody in the right place right time but  people are pretty laid back in ankharel as long as you follow the rules its /none/ a beautiful city  im actually excited for you to see it im very proud of it had i not made some mistakes  liam can we bring you anything back  matt you know what if you can there is a special spice that is harvested not far from the  city if you could find me some fusaka spice bring me a small not a lot just a bit  travis is it for food  matt its for food yes  liam i would love to do that well keep an eye out  matt its a /none/ bit

to buy a fine pig  marisha to market  sam home again home again  laura i didnt realize marquet was /none/ like emon this might be a bit difficult to find a oneeyed  merchant in a city bigger than emon  taliesin i think that once we arrive hell find us or she  laura this is true  sam we get there we start poking people in the eye until someone doesnt flinch then well know  we found them  taliesin can i point out that now we have to learn an entirely new lore weve worked so hard  and now spices rivers canals fusaka oh god id gotten everything together and now  laura weve only /none/ got two

should you place them  liam five gold mark it off  laughter  taliesin wow  sam how we doing on potions we got potions  laura we need to get some potions  travis theres no stores  matt the healing potions that were available in the city you guys have already taken  marisha yeah weve tapped them out there  taliesin yeah whitestone is not functioning  sam all right well /none/ get some in marquet  taliesin trade them for water  travis one for each  taliesin you stabbed her bear while maintaining eye contact  laura how many jugs did we get five jugs  matt five jugs  marisha slowly very slowly oh yeah  laura and we fill up our wineskins with water  taliesin were changing out of the winters into the lighter clothing  marisha i bust out some of my clothes from the fire ashari go lighter  taliesin its a shame kits very busy or else we could get summer clothes  matt /none/ shes so busy getting married or something  taliesin getting married or something  liam i break into a cold sweat thinking about the desert and this armor oh shit  laura youre going to be a gross sweaty greasy mess  taliesin okay actually there is a solution for this  liam yes percival i have never needed your intellect more than right now what is the solution  taliesin im going to find him a white silk and cotton linen cloak very simple to throw over  his armor the way the templars used to do so you /none/ wont cook in your bloody armor  marisha does his little sachet  taliesin yes itll attach to the sachet  marisha well i was going to say does his sachet need a reup of herbs i thought you  stuffed it with something  matt percival presents you with a nice flowing light whitishgray cloak ceremonial within older  whitestone gatherings it seems nice it seems light  liam and i can put it over everything else  laura over your other cloaks  liam cloaks plural fucking 90 episodes later cloaks cloaks cloaks  matt you can totally /none/ place it over your displacer cloak  taliesin yeah its just a heat sink  liam yeah its to bounce the heat off  laura perfect  liam liam knows science vax doesnt know shit  matt all right whats the plan  sam before we go quickly guys im sorry i havent done this yet so can i try to see where  kaylie is and do a little scry  matt you close your eyes and concentrate and you see peeking out from the metallic rim of the  sword which you gave her the aberrations bane longsword /dung/ you look up and you can see the edge of  a wooden table you hear faint music in the distance it sounds like some sort of a piano  being played no accompaniment just a straight piano you hear distant whispers of conversation  the occasional burst of laughter and you can see the edge of kaylies elbow leaning against the  edge of the table theres a long pause no movement then all of a sudden she shifts back  from the table and goes thats right all the money on the tables mine nice try scoops down /none/  throwing her hand of cards on the table you hear a couple voices go groaning you see her  scoop the coins over and go place them into a coin bag all right so perhaps another round then  sam yeah shes doing good  matt where are you going are you a coward or something shouting this in the distance as  apparently the previous people she card sharked walk off frustrated and growling you see one of  them comes up to the edge of the table and goes best be giving that money back little girl /town/ or youre  before that happens you see a large meaty hand grab the back of his neck and pick up him by the  scruff you see appear into view the very edge of dr dranzels chin and hat and he goes im  sorry were you talking to my lady friend that way thats poor manners and drops him there at  the table  the guy adjusts himself better not see you guys in the street he walks off  she reaches her hand up watching the guy leave and fistbumps dranzel your vision fades back and /none/  your consciousness comes back to you  sam shes okay okay good all right i feel good lets go  liam what were you doing  sam i had some bad tikka masala earlier  liam we havent even gone to marquet  sam they dont have middle eastern food there i hope  taliesin well  liam not going to touch that one  travis are we going  liam and taliesin lets go  matt all right you guys make your way back towards gilmores home at this point in time you  come in and find /none/ there are a couple of plates crumbs to the side gilmores sitting in the chair  with his tea eyes closed in a meditative stance as soon as you enter the room he jolts back to  momentary awareness all right gathered your things are you ready to go  liam pretty much  matt if you dont mind he grabs the edge of the central table in the center of the room with  the tea on it he looks towards you  travis oh yeah no problem  matt you guys shift it move it to the side /none/ leaving an open space on the ground he kneels  down and places one hand in the center of the floor the other hand he reaches back into a small  pouch on his side and pulls out a small amount of shimmering glassy sand material you recognize as  a hint of residuum processed into its dust crystallized form he scatters it around while  hes muttering under his breath as he does with his hand in the center you see the dust pull  together into these small symbols on their own almost like magnets to iron filings /none/ theyre  forming into these rigid structures as they do they begin to flare up and glow and he takes a  step back his eyes still closed brings his fist together into a grip as he does they light up  and you recognize this as a teleportation circle he goes all right it wont last long in you go  travis running through  laura thank you gilmore  matt my pleasure is the last thing you hear before you dive in as it begins to fade each of  you guys step into and transition past immediately /dung/ piling up into each other as you come  out the other side as youre in a dark and enclosed cupboard or closettype circumstance  taliesin im reaching for a door handle  laura anywhere  matt it looks like there is a set of doors to it its a giant armoire you guys are pushed into it  but it is latched over  liam ugh grogs pec is right in my eye  laura can i get a little dagger through and flip the latch  matt flick it up it bursts open and you all come stumbling /none/ out  liam i think he stabbed my eye out jeez  matt as you all stop vex you look back around this is a very large dresserlike armoire its  empty it looks like there are a number of hangers inside like it was a place for various outfits to  be kept and stored on the floor of the wood you can see carved into it a small symbol or a  sigil if you will  sam and laura drink  matt marked as the symbol he put  laura good thing no one destroyed this thing /dung/ while he was gone  matt glancing around you can see a small dark wood room atop a winered circular carpet in the  center empty shelves and cobwebs fill the corners theres a bit of dust and sand coating  over where the bed rests against the wall a closed window hides behind a drawn curtain with a  little bit of peeking sunlight making its way through there is one single door that sees you  out though it is currently closed  taliesin im going to stand on the carpet and will it to fly seems worth /none/ a shot  laura every carpet here  matt step onto the carpet close your eyes how do you will it  taliesin i do believe in fairies i do believe in fairies i know it ive killed several of  them theyre definitely real  matt moments pass no effect  liam im going to do my due diligence and make sure the doors okay probably is but just in case  taliesin im going to look out the window as well  laura i look under the bed  liam 22 just to make sure that its not /none/ trapped or locked  matt the door is locked it is not trapped youre peeking out the window you said  taliesin yeah i am  matt you glance through the cloth and it looks like it is a glass window but it is partially  opened and looks like theres a little cluster of sand thats gathered over time underneath the  sill from what little bit the winds pushed through glancing out as soon as you push out the  light is very bright and you have to take a moment for your eyes to adjust looking out /town/ you  see a simple street there are some small buildings built of fine wood nothing too  extravagant you can see a number of trees that protrude from the sand long tall thin palm  frondtype tops to them bearing some sort of large nutlike fruit you can see what look to be  small troughs of gathered water whether it be from rain or them placed there intentionally but  theyre currently locked with some semitranslucent top and chained shut on the  outside of two of the buildings you do see a few people walking back up /town/ and down the street  general civilians all dressed in longer fullbody robes some of them with scarves around  their neck i wouldnt say peasants per se but definitely not welloff in their appearance  casual civilians darker skin looks like theyve definitely been living in the desert for a long  time that is what you can see from the windows point of view  taliesin are we on the first floor or second floor  matt currently youre on the first floor  sam is there a second floor  matt you dont know  sam are /none/ there stairs oh were in a room lets go out the room what could happen  matt looking under the bed you see what appears to be a small wooden box that is closed and hidden  toward the very back and what appears to be a small series of shirts that have been folded up  and have gathered a lot of dust over the top of them  laura can i reach them  matt yeah pull them out really nice highquality silk and cotton based embroidered  shirts look more ceremonial special event type long maybe kneelength /none/  marisha whats the decoration like in the room  matt currently its pretty bland you can see a couple of colored tapestries similar to the center  of the floor rug that are hanging but there are a lot of blank areas it looks like decorations have  been removed or at least havent been there for a long time the room for the most part seems to  be abandoned  laura is the box trapped  matt make an investigation check  laura almost good and then not 14  matt 14 it does not appear to /none/ be trapped  laura can i open it  matt you do open it up glance inside it looks to be a series of folded papers  laura is it gilmores stuff  liam yeah youre going through shauns shit what are you doing  laura im just seeing if this is his room  marisha ooh whispers  travis oh shitballs i have to move  marisha how are those cowboys doing travis  travis tenten halftime  marisha oh snap  taliesin is that a good thing tenten at halftime  travis no not good  taliesin thats

them under the bed  liam can i read your diary then is that all right  laura i was seeing if we /none/ were in gilmores room thats all  liam yeah  laura yeah  liam all right  laura dont act like im a dick im not stealing the letters im putting the shirts back  all right  liam i didnt say it just maybe he wants a little privacy i dont know think about it  marisha shes learned from you well  laura is the door open can we go out of here  sam did you find anything good  liam if 25 opens the door then its opened  matt its easy enough like butter creaking /dung/ door the door opens  marisha he did say we would meet his family  matt as the door opens up immediately your nose catches the smell of sage and cooked meats as the  door opens you look into a large room to your left with some furniture not too extravagant but  nice and a humble living space as the door opens the other way you look to the right and you see  two figures sitting at a table seemingly eating an older couple with dark sunweathered skin  graying hair and bright eyes they look confused /none/ and slightly scared at their table staring back  at people wandering into the middle of the room  travis its okay  marisha hi  taliesin this is a bit awkward  sam were friends of gilmore  laura shaun  matt they both look at each other  sam oh be pleased  travis bees knees  matt they both look to each other and then immediately begin mouths filled with food  laughing laughs this is unexpected friends of shauns you say  all yes  matt the man himself stands up and begins to walk over /none/ wiping the edge of his mouth with a small  piece of cloth finishing chewing and swallowing the food he has currently as he walks up the man  has thinning white hair that grows long straight down towards his back simple long robelike dress  with simple cloth pants that go round these slipperlike shoes on his feet he approaches  which one said shaun  sam you said gilmore  matt gilmore and shaun approaches you as you stepping forward as one of the more you know  assertive members of the party and goes how is he /none/ if you could please tell me  laura hes quite well hes very powerful actually and has wonderful businesses all  through  marisha taldorei  laura no i know its just not there anymore  matt opesa opesa come  and the woman gets up from the table yes im sorry it has been a while since weve had guests  from so strange and sudden arrivals she walks up and pulls these small glasses out from her pocket  and puts them on you can see her eyes open up wide behind them and she comes leans to /none/

quickly  taliesin were sadly on a mission  laura can you tell us the direction to ankharel  matt you are going to ankharel  laura yes  matt yes follow me he takes her by the arm and they both walk arminarm leading you guys to  what looks to be a front door of this abode as he pushes it open revealing more of the street of  this small /town/ oasis town he goes lets see if you follow that is the sun he looks up and you  see his eyes adjust to the brighter sky the sun is there it will be setting that direction  continue what is the word you speak  sam north northwest no northeast  matt that is west you want to north so go that way yes that is where you want to go  laura thank you  sam is there a road to follow or is it just a direction  matt i havent been in many years as far /none/ as i know there are signs there are not roads there  are guides you could hire to bring you there  marisha can i do like a nature check or take note of what he said so i remember because that was vague  laura im assuming these are the people that gilmore said i would know  matt you get the sense these are probably who he was referring to  laura yes so as shes doing that i want to pull out the locket and say actually shaun asked me  to deliver this to you  /none/ matt what and he looks to his wife  the woman steps forward adjusting her glasses thank you so much she holds it and opens it up  looks over to him and shows him you get a bit of a glance at that point you can see its a  picture of gilmore hes happy jewelencrusted rings its almost a promotional still if there  was one for gilmores glorious goods she takes it she closes it and goes gilmore is originally  geddmore he changed his name when he went for better business to the taldorei place glad /none/ hes  doing well  taliesin hes respected across the continent  liam is there anything we can let him know  matt give him our love and tell him he is more than welcome to visit it has been many years  liam we will  laura thank you

of water with our compliments you said give them a jug  taliesin where do you store your water in the house  matt we have around this way he leads you towards the back of this small kitchen its very  condensed you can see there is a high metal fence and there appears to be a rainwater  receptacle there like a well that is built into the homestead it has chains over the top he  begins /none/ to pull keys out and lock to it and as he pulls off the chains one by one he pulls back the  lid this hard dry wooden lid and within it is a very deep well though it looks like the water  levels maybe ten feet down from the top of the well right now  travis you want me to pour the alchemy jug in here or just one of the little ones  taliesin pour the alchemy the little ones for us today the alchemy jug this is where its going  travis all right i /none/ take the alchemy jug and i go you want to see a trick look inside do you  see anything  matt hey opesa do you see anything  and she blinks a bit

travis i am a great sorcerer  matt all right i can see now gilmore has his work cut out for him  travis geddemoray  matt he pats your shoulder geddmore indeed as you finish pouring the water out they lead you  guys back to the front  laura what time is it here  matt he pulls out a small sundial from his pocket holds it up it would be closer to late afternoon  laura no we arent /dung/ going to make it to ankharel by dark yes of course thats all thank you  matt well thank you so much for coming  taliesin good day  travis beepbeep  sam taliesin and liam be pleased  matt be pleased and they both in a very rusty joints way give you both a bow as you leave  liam they were a couple of sweethearts  sam they are adorable theyre both over 70 so whos going to kill them should grog or should i  taliesin i think its our turn  laura you broke him  /none/ sam you kill one ill kill the other  liam throwback thursday  taliesin this is what a d10 is for hold on one second  marisha do we have any more reason to be here or should we start heading off to ankharel  taliesin i think we head off to ankharel  laura yeah unless we see any kind of potion shops here  marisha i can mist us i brought it today  taliesin oh we can mist  liam is there enough moisture in the air i have no idea how it works  travis shit /none/ if we evaporate ill be so pissed  marisha wait can that happen  travis you dont know  taliesin i think itll be fine  marisha because were mist  taliesin were mostly water i think its our water i think we end up very dehydrated at the  end of it  marisha sorry i just spit all over you im sorry  taliesin its okay now im moister  marisha thats how mist form works  travis now im moisture  marisha i dont think wed evaporate i think hes fucking with us i dont think wed /none/  evaporate  laura lets mist it  matt that would be the saddest tpk ever lets go guys and so ends the journey of vox  machina  laughter  marisha they fade into existence  laura that would be the worst thing ever  taliesin was that a global warming metaphor  travis no songs to be sung just fucking another cloud in the fucking sky  sam some say you can see them still overhead  laughter  marisha i dont think well evaporate  laura lets do it  sam were going to mist it  /town/ marisha do we need anything else while were here before i do this  taliesin its a onecamel town  marisha i mist us  matt all right as you guys take a moment to concentrate each one of you transforms into mist  as you begin to go one by the other you do hear a couple of gasps you glance over your shoulder  to see three kids all looking up at you all with these big scared smiles  marisha before i go i say stay in school kids and then i mist  taliesin im going /none/ to slimer the kid  laura as i turn into mist i go im melting melting oh what a world  matt make a deception check  marisha i was trying to inspire them  taliesin youre a terrible person  laura 20  liam do they speak common  matt after you give your presentation they whoa as you begin transforming you do that and  they go terrified screaming and go running indoors  taliesin im still going to slime them on their way out  marisha sliming them  sam were tormenting children  liam hey thats /town/ a step up for us  matt thats what vox machina is all about  taliesin scarring children for life  travis if you cant kill the old terrify the young  taliesin were leaving them with a promise that well be back to finish the job  matt you are terrible people you guys rise into the air as the sun begins to bring itself to set  in the west you shift up over the city you look down probably maybe 150 200 buildings make up  the entirety of shandal its not a very large town but /none/ you can see little dots of moving  caravans both to and from the city it is a fairly lively stop for people traveling to and from  ankharel  taliesin we can follow traffic  marisha follow traffic  taliesin theres a traffic line then  matt every now and then as you follow the direction theyre going youre traveling much  faster than they are the hot air does feel a little uncomfortable against your cloudbased  misty forms but you do not feel like its responsible for evaporating any of your form  marisha yeah were just /none/ sweating a little bit more  matt youre like oh this is  uncomfortable you continue to press forward as  the sun slowly begins to set the temperature begins to get colder and colder and the sky grows  darker  marisha do we condense a little bit turn into a lowlying fog never mind  matt if youd like to its up to you entirely the form is your choice  travis could we turn into a marine layer  matt you continue to travel throughout the night  sam how long does this thing last  laura /none/ eight hours right it lasts eight hours  sam well travel eight hours  taliesin well take a late night once it wears off then well camp  laura can we get the whole way there  marisha wind walk you said it was a days journey and we can travel faster by wind  walking  sam at night will we know where northeast is  laura yeah ive got an excellent sense of direction  taliesin if its only a days travel at some point were going to see the city  marisha i think we should be /none/ able to get there right  laura and we can camp just outside the city maybe  sam okay lets do it  marisha because we have a flying speed of 300 feet  matt yes you guys cruise you guys push forward for another four to five hours postdusk youre  now hitting the early hours of the morning before you begin to see in the distance hundreds of  sparking lights begin to appear up above a distant sand dune you can see the lit lights lanterns  and general glowing night life of a massive city over /none/ the high walls that surround its exterior  this is a pretty amazing sight for those of you who have not been to such a large desert  atmosphere and it is pitch black below you and at the height youre traveling how high are you  traveling versus the ground i guess i should ask  taliesin 300 feet  marisha an appropriate cloud height  sam thats thousands  marisha hundreds a couple hundred feet  matt okay from this view you can see a large queue about eight heavy caravan carts long of  caravans that have /none/ camped for the night outside of the front main gates you do see along the line  of the outer wall there appear to be a number of small spires that open up like guard tower  parapets that come to a pointed what looks like a hand cradling the outside of each section of the  wall on the outside but on the inside you see a hundred or more of these long multilevel spires  that progress all throughout the city and it goes on and on in its large ovallike shape its hard  to make out /none/ much color other than the thousand small lights you see throughout the entire city  orange yellows greens blues it is a beautiful view what is your plan  taliesin i say we camp outside  liam are we still clouds though  taliesin were still clouds  liam cant talk at all  laura should we mist down  sam are we getting to the end of our eight hours anyway  marisha its been five or six  laura its still night  matt still night yes  laura its good to camp  matt its two in /town/ the morning at this point  marisha does there look like any patch of shrubs or a low point in the terrain cover  matt you cant tell from this height unfortunately  laura we mist down a little bit  matt you scoot down around the outside of the city walls the landscape here near the town  appears to be more packed and hardened badland dust and sand you can see where lots of it from  a recent rain have caked and hardened and then broken in places it leaves this soft shaletype  texture to it /none/ that breaks into sand upon crumbling underfoot from what you can see there are a  number of various heights of dunes in the distance this city is thrown right in the center  of what appears to be hundreds of miles of desert from the view that you had as the sun was  setting  laura and the gates to the city are closed at night  matt the gates to the city are closed from this perspective yes  liam we did it you guys we made it to burning man  matt you guys timed this /none/ i didnt  laura can we see guards around do they look aggressive  matt the giant iron gates stand about 65 feet tall and about as wide from end to end they have  a very tight weave of iron bars between them to where its almost a very thick fencing that you  can almost see through you can just see the outline of things that walk back and forth behind  it however on the front side you can see a number of guards  laura we can see your piece of paper on the screen still /dung/ see it  matt stop looking at my piece of paper on the screen  liam theres a vestige  matt not actually not anymore its not its gone all right amongst the carvedout circle of  caravan carts and people that are camping overnight before entering the city you do see  what appear to be a dozen guards all dressed in dark blue and dark reddish metallic armor many  carrying heavy scimitars to their side or long pikes and shields theyre all wearing intricate  helmets that crest down past the nose to the point where it /none/ looks like they just have eyes and a  lower jaw it flares out at the bottom and then curves to a point right across where the clavicle  would be the armor itself is designed in a very beautiful ornate fashion but also looks very  functional youre at a distance they dont seem to have noticed you as youve all crested down  still in your cloud forms  laura we should probably land far away  taliesin im going to demist there seems to be a section where people are camping lets just  for once take /none/ this by the book we want to make sure they know were here no sneaking into the city  marisha i dont think theyd take kindly to surprises  taliesin at worst weve got the pretense of being emissaries from emon looking for help  marisha yeah  liam they punish people for nicking things i dont think we want to try to break in  taliesin no were going to try and be truthful as much as possible although nobody say the w word  travis wine  laura wine definitely wine  marisha im assuming that thats the /none/ hand of ord that were looking at  sam the hand of ord is supposed to be super secret  taliesin it might just be guards  matt the hand of ord isnt secret  marisha no he said the hand of ord is the name of the peacekeeping guards  taliesin yes thats right  laura all right  taliesin lets camp for the evening  laura shall we camp in the mansion then  taliesin yes  laura so comfortable  sam sure  liam were still a distance though where we are from the guards  laura /none/ yeah were off a little bit  matt how far are you guys how far did you decide to stop and transform thats up to you  liam i dont know  taliesin where were the other people camping for the night  matt theyre maybe 40 feet from the gates  taliesin well lets camp 40 feet lets camp with them  travis you want to put a magical door 40 feet  taliesin im perfectly okay its not like they can come in no one can enter who cant be  invited  liam you want to make /none/ a mystical door floating in the middle of their tents  laura do the people seem friendly do they seem tired  taliesin were going to camp next to their campsite  matt make a perception check  liam in this world on the ground i love it we havent done it that much lately  taliesin weve been too used to being careful  marisha in the mansion  laura 22  marisha so not really camping were glamping  matt at a safe distance you can make out some detail and there is some lantern light on top /none/ of  some of these carts it appears that a number of the folks have set up small tents and most appear  to be sleeping there are a few guards that are set on top of the carts with crossbows resting  over their lap keeping an eye in case anyone decides to get too close to their wares throughout  the evening  laura how about we keep a distance  marisha yeah lets not mist down in the middle of a group  laura no lets keep a distance from them and be another group of people /none/ coming into the city  travis id say 200 yards out  liam percival said he already unmisted  marisha were deciding how far so 200 yards  taliesin i can remist  liam we can all do that  taliesin as long as the eight hours hasnt passed we can go in and out as you please isnt  that correct  matt yeah it takes you a minute to transform  sam should we use our misting while we have it and mist into the city  travis thats what i said but they punish crime so harshly /none/  sam we havent committed any crime  laura no but they have to document who goes in and out  sam they wont even know  liam scanman lets start by playing nice please  marisha and if we get caught theyre going to know we didnt sign in correctly  taliesin they have giant spires yeah and theyre going to say who are you and were not  going to be on the list  liam we know nothing about these people or the customs here  travis yeah weve got to learn a little bit before we /none/ kill all of them  marisha i dont see any trees and those guards look heavily funded that looks like expensive  armor theyre all wearing  taliesin youve got a good eye yes  laura can we have the mansion scanlan  sam sure yes we can do the mansion  taliesin get close enough to the other group that they are aware that we exist but they couldnt  quite make us out so just another group of travelers camping for the night  liam with a door floating in the air  taliesin its magic its not /none/ like theyve never seen it before  matt the light radius beyond the wall itself is not very strong it only lowlights maybe a 30 to  40foot area around the gate itself and there are a series of small torches that appear to be  everburning on the outside of the wall there are a few campfires that have been set up by the  caravans that are waiting amongst the sand and broken ground there they give a little more  light as you guys get to the outskirts of this your shapes becoming visible to those that /none/ are  keeping watch you see a few individuals stand up on their carts with their crossbows at the ready  just have a seat and keep an eye bead on those of you that are visible doesnt appear to be any  aggressive action just an acknowledgement of your presence and a show of readiness should any  aggressive action be taken  liam im going to not say anything but do the be pleased motion  laura he already did that  liam well im doing it as well  laura im going to watch you do it /none/  sam so weve unmisted are we going to mansion and go to sleep  taliesin were going to mansion its 200am its time to mansion and go to sleep  sam all right well do that  marisha okay the people who are camping what do they look like pretty common folk im assuming  matt best you tell at this distance the few that you can see because a lot of them appear to be  in small tents encamped the few that you do make out appear to be dressed in a little more wealthy  attire /none/ than the people you encountered in shandal you can see the gentlemen and ladies that are  guarding the encampment are dressed in functional leathers with hints of hide and metal plates  incorporated in the defense but nothing that shows overt wealth or overt destitution general  mercenary guardians for a traveling caravan  marisha okay are we going to talk to any of them  taliesin unless theres a brazenly loud group around one of the campfires  matt at this hour no you get the sense looking at the surroundings of the campfires it looks  like /none/ some sort of party or gathering may have transpired earlier in the evening but most  everyone have passed out at this time  laura the guards are guarding anybody that approaches is a threat  sam yeah well just go to sleep  taliesin goodnight all i am ready for bed  matt scanlan  sam i will make the mansion  matt the doorway glows with a faint purple hue in the distance you see some of the guards step  forward and keep an eye out there attention has been gained by the doorway but none of /town/ them are  approaching immediately you guys begin to step into the doorway one by one as three of the guards  begin to slowly walk towards the doorway  taliesin ill go last itll be fine  marisha i go in  liam scanlan why dont you hang with percival i go in  travis yeah in  laura i stand in the doorway  sam we going to talk to these people  taliesin were going to let them know who we are and what were doing this is just that we have a  very expensive tent /none/  sam great  matt so with that percival scanlan and vex wait outside the shimmering doorway to scanlans  magnificent mansion you see the guards begin to approach the one at the front a squarejawed  intenselooking man who looks to be not enjoying his current time schedule as a guard on the  outside of the southern gates of ankharel approaches hand at the side clutching some sort  of weapon that he has currently sheathed may i ask the business of this strange conjuration  youve brought at this hour of the night  taliesin it is /town/ our very expensive tent  sam taliesin and laura be pleased  matt make a persuasion check percy  taliesin thatll do 23 yeah 24 actually 24  matt i do not know of the nature of this magic that you bring but i recommend that you keep it  outside of the city  taliesin oh yes of course  laura wait is magic not allowed within the city  matt oh magic is allowed but this is unknown to us and unknown magic is a dangerous magic  taliesin i thank you for your advice we will heed /none/ it well what is your name sir  matt it does not matter we have 12 crossbows trained on this doorway and will for the  remainder of the evening should anything strange happen we will not hesitate but to fire  taliesin the strangest thing you will see this evening will be us  matt good  laura thank you for the warning  matt turns around and walks back to the gate  taliesin that could not have gone better  travis singing weve got to kill everybody  laughter  laura magic is allowed but this is /tavern/ strange magic how will we know what isnt strange magic  taliesin everything we can do is strange magic be prepared that not being from around here is  going to be trouble  marisha yeah i think were just strange  laura i hold the door open  liam weve had old magic new magic strange magic  matt this is all the new schools of magic  sam we go in  matt you guys go in mansions prepared servants are at your ready beds are freshly fluffed  damaged kitchens are rearranged to have been not touched /none/ at all  travis what  laura wonderful  sam i love it  matt you are able to rest for the evening as you prepare for your next day entering the city of  ankharel itself  taliesin i make my way quietly in the night to grogs room i was just kidding sorry  travis laughing i was like come get some bitch  laura no i want to go to sleep and im holding on to fenthras and thinking about everything  matt mulling over the events that recently transpired and digesting all the questions you  /none/ still have  taliesin i gave you a lot to think about didnt i sorry laughs  sam i play a card game by myself  matt okay as you guys have a restful night were going to take a break well be back here in  a few minutes and well pick this up in the following morning as they enter the city itself  see you in a minute  break  matt welcome back everyone returning from the break vox machina has an evening of rest in  scanlans magnificent mansion you come to consciousness the following /none/ morning stationed  within the beautiful confines of this magical mansion unaware directly of what awaits you on  the other side of the doorway however the morning is yours what do you wish to do  liam im going to stealth back to my room  matt okay laughs  laura oh  marisha no one sees anything  matt make a stealth check  liam no worries i got a one but ill use luck  marisha youre using a luck  liam two ones  taliesin two ones  all yelling yes  taliesin there is a /none/ god and he hates you  marisha you are so walk of shaming right now  laughter  matt so as the morning comes

brother slowly slinking away from keyleths room  laura retching i go back in my room  liam oh hey hold on a second though  travis oh man laughs talk it out  marisha /none/ talk it out right now  laura

laura something with veggies  sam lets do ravioli staff  matt yes scanlan  laura oh they speak  travis shit they do talk  /none/ sam could you make us some chicken ravioli  liam you unlocked ravioli in marquet  laura theyre learning  travis theyre smart we have to kill them all  taliesin theyre going to learn  matt the servants vanish for about ten minutes and return with a robust meal of bowls and bowls  of chicken ravioli  travis chicken ravioli laughs  laura delicious  sam yummy  travis good call  taliesin adequate  matt slightly you finish your meal feel yourself satiated as much as you can be with  chicken ravioli for breakfast you guys /none/ exit find yourself on the exterior walls of ankharel the  sun blazing down in the early morning a hotter temperature than youve been used to in quite some  time would be the equivalent of probably the low 100s fahrenheit by our standards all of you with  layers of armor which is all of you except for grog immediately feel this is going to be  uncomfortable fairly quickly grog you are used to higher colder climates even without being  heavily armored still fairly uncomfortable  travis sucks  liam youre really pale too  matt its /dung/ not great you can see the caravans that you guys were camping loosely next to are no  longer there it looks like there have been a couple of dark spots in the dust and the sand that  have been kicked over where the campsites were where the fires were put out and tracks of where  the carts and wheels have been dragged to and through the gate you can now see about ten guards  that are all stationed at the front of that iron gate on this side of the ankharel wall  sam well should /none/ we go in and be traveling people and kill everyone that we see  travis how about you let me take the lead on this  laura how about no  sam whats our angle we are weary travelers from taldorei seeking  marisha i thought we were going into this one with honesty thought we agreed to that  sam seeking help  marisha were ambassadors from emon  travis keyleth do you really want to be honest or is it a ploy do we want to be honest  taliesin the ploy is to be honest  marisha /none/ our normality is dishonesty so technically were switching it up  laura this is the ploy  taliesin this is a radical shift  marisha were not honest so lets try it for once  sam all right lets do it were from emon we need help fighting dragons  marisha i feel like thats pretty compelling  matt grog make an intelligence check  travis laughs yeah thank you travis needs to make an intelligence check oh jesus its a 12  minus two  matt you have no idea what theyre talking about you find yourself instinctually nodding /none/  sam well just go in big guy well be fine  liam first chance for violence is all yours youre the first one in  travis im all in violence thats what i came away with  marisha sighs we have to be careful with our word choices with him  taliesin we head towards the gate  travis garbled this ravioli is delicious by the way my compliments to the little purple men  sam theyre not men but yes  matt as you guys approach the outside of the gate you can see seven of the guards /none/ stay behind  while three seemingly the same three that had been keeping a close eye upon your initial  approach in the evening walk up the same man walks up now looking a little tired his day is  probably finishing out the rest of his station here at the gate approaches hand still on the  side of his sheathed weapon so you awaken you have rested what is your business here in  ankharel  sam we are weary travelers from emon and we have come to seek assistance with the security of our home  matt /none/ what is your contact within the city who do you wish to speak to  liam go for the top  marisha oh thats a really far stretch the king  sam we are seeking a man called  liam jmon sa ord  sam no i dont think we want to talk to the king do we  marisha merchant warrior no not that one who the fuck are we trying to see  sam we would like to talk to jmon sa ord or his or her advisors to seek advice  matt you come for an audience /none/ with the emperor  taliesin we come for an audience with many people to be honest we are looking at many  avenues of possible help contacts trade anything that can help us in our time of dire need  matt make a persuasion check  sam me or him  matt you  sam oh okay it was a million  taliesin i didnt know that that die went that high  sam 34  laura its a million  matt his arm relaxes at the side of his weapon and he looks down upon your diminutive gnomish  /none/ structure though glances over at the much larger goliath and back at you if you indeed have  business with jmon sa ord then the emperor will let you in if you do not you will be sent out  we have no business between either of those answers if you wish to enter do so but keep  your weapons sheathed and keep an eye on that one  sam the big one  matt yes  liam hes wellbehaved  matt i dont trust his face  taliesin his face is usually not the trouble  liam is /none/ it the beard  matt very well welcome to ankharel be pleased  all be pleased  matt he turns around and walks away his bow is much smaller than you were originally taught by  jarett you get the sense that thats more of a formality and is on a smaller scale for more  informal conversations as he walks back he lifts one hand and does a loop with it as he does  door thudding the gates open ever so slightly enough to bring through as broadshouldered an  individual as grog as well as the rest /none/ of you easily you guys walk up and approach  laura is anybody looking at trinket weird or is it okay hes with us  matt actually no one seems to bat an eye at the large bear thats wandering inside  travis but they give a shit about the goliath thats fucked up  taliesin one last question for our good friend at the gate  matt okay as you walk past him  taliesin one more thing good sir if you were going to find a place to sleep comfortably  quietly and without incident for the evening /none/ in the city is there a place that you would  recommend to a friend  matt well best i can think there are many fine establishments of rest where rooms can be rented  throughout the entirety of the city depending on how much coin you have to give i would say you  could he thinks for a second as i look at my notes  taliesin where you would put a brotherinlaw that you liked  liam medium to high  matt i would recommend within the suncut bazaar you would find the debts respite the shade /none/ or  the corner cove all very fine establishments and very well watched by the hand  travis the hand  sam are you a member of the hand  matt i am is this your first time in the city then  taliesin it is absolutely yes  matt laughs  marisha what was the name of the district  laura the suncut bazaar  marisha suncut bazaar  matt as he watches you guys enter the gates closing behind you you now see the incredible  reveal of the interior of the mystical city itself streets of smooth /town/ cobblestonelike red  pebbles lead your eyes to hundreds of visible verticallyinclined buildings of reaching peaks  and smooth pointed rooftops as far as your eye can see across the cityscape its a city of  vibrant color you see nearly every home storefront and outhouse has some form of draping  silks or painted mural to give it individual character standing out against the rest of its  neighboring abodes creating a calming beautiful symphony of really nothing in the presentation of  it all the people are walking with purpose and the sounds of foreign barking and shouts /none/  occasionally break the air welcome to ankharel  taliesin lets get arrested right now  marisha fight  matt what do you guys wish to do  sam we need spice we need to find out about this merchant guy  travis got to get laid  sam we got to get laid every continent right thats our pact  laughter  travis theres nothing that doesnt mean its a pact  taliesin were going to need to talk to some gentry were going to need to talk to a library  marisha well we should probably start with /tavern/ a tavern  taliesin and i should also mention not just a tavern is available but we do in fact have three  titled people within our crowd so we can actually talk to people of standing and note with very  little difficulty  liam are we certain that that will hold any water on this continent  taliesin it holds water on every continent only people who are not titled think it doesnt  sam should we split up into a couple parties no all right  taliesin lets find a tavern find some rooms lets go to /none/ this bazaar  marisha people tend to know things in taverns  taliesin get the word out of what were looking for  sam to the suncut bazaar  travis wait what if theres a market like an open farmers market we could get some spice  laura yeah as we look around do we see any markets actually the shopping district would be  a wonderful place to look for  marisha is that in the suncut bazaar or could we head that direction while we look  sam oi oi you there boy  laughter  matt as /town/ you glance over you see walking down the street what appears to be two teenage boys  huddled together wearing drab anklelength cloth robes one of them has a purple shawl over  their shoulders the other has a hood up and theyre both carrying small satchels of fruit in  their arms they both stop and turn they look curiously at the small gnome the small pale  gnome in foreign clothes and adorned beautiful armor that walks up to them in the street  sam that looks like fine fruit where would you go to go shopping for /none/ things here markety things  matt muttered conversation you are a very small man  sam ive heard that its a glandular condition  laughter  matt im sorry to hear that  sam yes my cross to bear ive seen many medicine men about it but they cant cure it but  many have recommended that i get a diet of vegetables and fruit where could i buy some just  like the kind that you have  matt this fruit is actually very difficult to find and come across if you wish you could  purchase this batch /none/  sam okay ive seen this before im not interested in buying from you i just want a  market or a bazaar or anything  matt bazaar you are looking for the suncut bazaar  sam yeah that  matt it is farther down that way look to the blue tower in the center of the city walk in its  direction to the eastern skyline  laura im not looking in the direction im keeping my eyes on them the entire time hes  talking  matt okay make a perception check  marisha im desperately trying to /town/ commit every direction to memory  taliesin i am so fearful that hes about to try and buy meth from children  laura 20  matt look for the strings of crimson flags that hang across the very street corners that will  signify the entrance to the suncut bazaar  sam youre so helpful  matt 20 they both seem confused but also strangely enamored with this tiny man whos  talking to them no shifty behavior beyond that  travis their hands arent moving into someones pockets  laura no  sam thank you so much young men /none/ for your help also spice  laughter  travis yes oh my god  taliesin no  sam do you spice  marisha do you spice  travis yo you cool you cool dog  matt muttered conversation i dont know what youre talking about  sam im not an authority do you spice spice it  matt i am sorry im confused  sam its cool ignore that part thank you so much what do you think a little spice  matt he puts his hand out  sam i flip him a coin  matt he takes it /town/ good luck finding your fruit  sam okay thank you  matt and they both walk away but at a slow pace looking over their shoulder at you the whole way  sam they seemed legit they seemed like they were street kids  taliesin what about that was legit  sam theyre riffraff they could know what spice is  taliesin they were carrying fruit  sam they look normal but ive got a keen eye for these things i was a kid on the street for a long time  liam sam no joke thanks for the ab /town/ workout  laughter  taliesin oh god  travis fuck that was great  taliesin i cant  liam deep sigh  travis do we go in the direction  laura we walk towards the suncut bazaar keeping an eye out  matt all right as you guys continue deeper into the city the sheer size of this town reminds you  of a mirror universe form of emon in the way that the streets narrow and then open and the  liveliness of culture around you in its heyday and it saddens you because it reminds you of back /town/  when the city was at its prime when you first arrived and made it a home for yourself but at  the same time the energy is infectious and you cant help but feel like theres a lot of  interesting people culture and momentum all about you no matter where you seem to walk across  these streets though the culture here appears to be far older than that of emon that youve  encountered even the buildings and constructs range in ways that maybe not as old as  vasselheim per se but at least you can /town/ see that theres some variation to some of the abodes here  that have been worn through time more so than any you have encountered in taldorei for the most  part these decorated and intricate buildings fill the streets you can see pride in their  construction and the smells of horses and hot desert air combine with various burning spice and  sage that occasionally wafts through the air to your nostrils the everchanging exotic skyline  occasionally grabs your attention you see the distant shadow of what looks like a skyship docked  at a sky port /none/ you get looks of many citizens expressions ranging from amusement to mistrust as  you pass by until you come upon a massive building that shines with the sunlight  above you you see a number of red flags that hang and drift about five feet in length these thin  draping pieces of silk that shift with the breeze and you can see numbers of these strands across  different roads and its at this point that you look up and realize that this is the entrance to  the suncut bazaar looking off towards the left and what /dung/ youve been watching as you  approach there are this cluster of dark blue and purple towers of various widths marking a  central place in the center of the city in the center of them there is one very large  cylindrical tower that rises up past them all into what looks like a chalice or a cuplike platform  at the very top that is impossibly high amongst the rest of the structures here in the city it  seems to be a beacon or watchtower over the entirety of ankharel  but your attention now here in /town/ the suncut bazaar as you step around the corner you can see tents  and storefronts and buildings and voices raised as different barkers are shouting out for their  wares you can see carts being drawn through the streets by horse and camel you can see what  appear to be dozens upon dozens of people coming through with small satchels and coming by and  purchasing their necessities for the day you can smell cooking meats and food in the distance you  can see street performers juggling and distant music of buskers in the side of the /town/ street  playing various flutes and instruments some you recognize some you do not you actually see a  shawm it catches your attention on the side of the street  sam i need a new reed for that  matt and here you are amongst the suncut bazaar  travis can i whip around and see if anyones following us  sam ooh dust of tracelessness  matt make a perception check  travis hammer down 14  matt 14 no matter where you walk eyes are on you  travis i am a gorgeous man  matt most /town/ people you come around here it seems a largely human population beyond that youve not  seen a single dwarf as youve walked through the city but you have seen a number of darkskinned  halflings a few halfelves not an elf has caught your eye since youve wandered through youve  seen a couple of tieflings that walk openly in this city which is a rare thing from emon even  there most tieflings generally are met with mistrust and prejudice in the street here no one  seems to pay mind or bother you do see a few /none/ halforcs this team of halforcs that are shouting  out in a language that none of you understand some sort of sales pitch theyre giving and  theres a few people gathered around them this is a very wide variety of people that live in this  city and everyone seems to mesh together without issue or prejudice but not one goliath has caught  your eye and youve caught the eyes of many and wherever you walk you can see the townspeople  stop and they dont gawk they dont stare intently theyre more curious but no one  /town/ appears to be following you  laura are the shops here indoors or are they outdoor tent markets  matt there are a few that appear to go into buildings but the majority of this as you look  at now the suncut bazaar itself while it is a section of the city it is mostly open sky and is  probably hundreds of various tents carts popup standups and even the center of the street  blankets set out with the various merchants there with their wares strewn across the ground waiting  for anybody to come and approach /none/  laura do we see any spice merchants  matt go ahead and make an investigation check  liam also while shes rolling do we all see people eyeballing him  matt yeah its pretty easy to see and most everyones  travis in love enamored jealous  laura 11  matt 11 you look around and ask a few people and most everyone shrugs their shoulders or points  you in an odd direction and no immediate spice merchants catch your attention youre still on  the outskirts of the suncut  marisha do there appear to be any /none/ fruit merchants  matt there are a few actually yeah and its interesting in this very hot desert environment  and you understanding how most plant life exists fruit should be pretty damn rare and what fruit  would make it here seems to be pretty dry and withered but everything you come across here is very  plump beautiful and fresh  taliesin life  marisha and taliesin needs things to live  marisha theres not many things no can i go up to one of the fruit merchants  matt you go up to what appears to be /dung/ a woman probably in her late thirties her hair is long  past her shoulders and these dark black brunette waves that spray out like mermaid hair across her  shoulders as you approach she eagerly reaches out you look like you are traveling here to  ankharel in search of beautiful delicious fruits of which to whet your palate yes would you like for  these fine apples of which are the finest you could find  marisha apples oh wow i was looking for something a little bit more exotic something  native to this land  matt /none/ ah well she takes the apples back what youd prefer then would be the kurrak  fruit and she pulls out what looks like a mango but the exterior of it is very rough with these  little spines all around it while it is difficult to hold crack open for a delightful  flavor it is gentle it is like a sweet water experience  marisha that was very descriptive thank you  matt of course  marisha how much do i owe you for this  matt for this that would be two silver pieces  marisha two /none/ silver and how much just for future reference are the apples  matt the apples would go for one silver piece apiece  marisha one silver apiece thats pretty steep dont worry about it here you go i give her a  little extra  matt thank you so much for your patronage anything else you would like  marisha i think im good thank you  laura i peek around her shoulder where would the shade be  matt the shade the shade would be its hard to explain do you see that building over there  with the /dung/ dark green steeple and you glance off in the distance you can see layers back there  appears to be one spire this very harsh point that has a dark green tint that is the roof of  the shade thatd be what youre looking for  laura thank you so much  matt not a problem  liam i would like to walk by and as im passing vex im going to do that thing where you walk  past a friend and you do that sideways kick in the butt and im going to go stand by grog /none/ and  anybody i see giving him the evil eye im going to match it back  matt okay you watch as she walks away she had her hands out to vex and as soon as vex keeps  walking away she goes  marisha i toss her a gold shes with me  matt you are free to shop here any day you like  marisha and what was your name  matt she pulls the coin out and pops it away and says i am shubad  marisha shubad  matt shubad  marisha keyleth  matt a /none/ pleasure to meet you  marisha a pleasure thank you so much  travis are any of the barkers talking about magic stuff  taliesin im also looking for a soothsayer  liam what do you want to see a show  travis well i dont know it just seems so exotic  taliesin anything out of the ordinary andor a soothsayer cardreader bonesreader whatever  they have thats like that  matt okay both of you make investigation checks as you look around and ask around  liam and i dont like the way these folks are looking at /none/ big man so im going to stay by him  matt you stay close to grog  laura no going up from that thats what it is  travis negative two  laughter  sam is that true  travis yep  taliesin i am cityblind apparently  laura what are you looking for  taliesin im looking for anything out of the ordinary but specifically a soothsayer a  cardreader a bonesthrower  matt grog glancing about you look to see something shine across the ground as you rush up  and find it you find what looks to /none/ be a magically enchanted stone about that big rough around the  edges but the reddish color is brighter red than the rest of the stones on the ground and youre  sure that this may be exactly what you were looking for  liam im watching him  travis i quickly get on my hands and knees and i start moving the sand around looking for one just  like it just to make sure its unique  matt there are many red stones around it as you press the bit of dust and sand gathered around the  /none/ other cobblestones but this one appears to be unique  travis oh what does it taste like  matt theres a hit of saltiness to the dust that has gathered in this vicinity  travis i gave away my saltlick rock  matt you did  laughter  liam i take a moment to marvel at how a being of such ferocity and power can be such a doofus at  the same time its amazing  sam im going to plant myself at the end of two rows of the intersection and wait for people to  walk by /none/ and as they do i say spice spice spice spice you spice it spice spice spice  laura can i have seen percy looking around  matt yeah  laura can i help him look  matt percival what did you roll  taliesin where did it go investigation i rolled a nine  matt yeah its funny for all the preparation of being a noble and public speaking you are utterly lost  taliesin oh im terrible in urban areas ive learned this i get flustered  matt the culture is so vastly different from what youre used to /none/ and the people dont seem to  really pay much mind to your relatively important outfit and presence and youre lost at sea  taliesin ive never rolled a decent investigation check it has never happened  matt vex walks up to you  laura what are you looking for dear  taliesin beyond anything interesting everything is too interesting  laura its very colorful  taliesin a soothsayer of some kind perhaps it might be a good way to start getting the word out  of the sorts of things were looking for  laura what sorts of things /none/  taliesin were looking for a cloak were looking for a merchant with one eye  travis i found a rock  taliesin and were looking for rocks not anymore i suppose and those are usually the most  trustworthy of the untrustworthy people you find in a city  laura investigation 19  matt 19 the two of you begin to meander around look around you see after some wandering what  looks to be a single blanket set out with a small halfdome shade structure of various cotton cloths  that have been layered and pinned to create /none/ this loose escape from the sunlight and you see what  appears to be an older man with a very long braided beard that goes past his bellybutton he  sits there sleeveless open shirt baggy pants no shoes and before him a deck of cards that is  laying in a stack and he has his eyes closed with his hands resting at the ends of his knees  liam it sounds like fun  laura want to walk up yeah  taliesin you mind blowing a little bit of money on this  laura no actually  marisha /none/ are we all there  matt depends on if you guys want to follow  marisha id like to follow  matt okay as you guys are approaching you over in the corner  sam spice it spice it fusaka  matt make a deception check  sam a billion deception  matt deception yeah  sam 32  matt this marks your ability to doubletalk or subtly put out the vibes for an individual  liam why arent you a crime kingpin  matt who knows what scanlans ultimate destiny is  taliesin i have a song for your /dung/ next playlist im so excited  matt after a few moments of you doing this and a few people walking away looking frustrated and  taken aback partially by your visual form and the unexpected contents of your words one man in his  early twenties walking up what looks to be a damp cloth wrapped loosely around the head to keep the  head cooled under the suns heat walks up and leans in and goes youre asking about spice yes  sam yes hardtofind spice i dont know if they have it in this particular bazaar it takes /none/ a  seller with a keen eye to identify it  matt well i know folks who are purveyors of many spices here please what do you seek  sam its not really something that i want to discuss out in the open but we could take a walk  and talk about it  matt good good lead on well have a conversation as we go as he stands back up after  leaning down for you you get a little glance at what appears to be a slightly pointed ear and what  looks like a hint of /town/ a mustache thats grown through very similar in visual presentation as to  your comrades not full elf not full human though definitely a much darker shade due to the  outintheopen lifestyle of ankharel you begin to walk with this figure through the street well  get to you in just a moment so as you guys make your way to the older gentleman sitting on the  ground eyes closed  laura we sit down in front of him  matt his eyes are still closed  laura taliesin and marisha be pleased  matt be pleased his /none/ eyes open and you can see his eyes are snowblind they are clouded over  with what would probably be terrible cataracts or something else that has caused him full blindness  but he stares past you as he opens his eyes so you wish to be read then  laura marisha and taliesin yes  matt five gold for my services  sam whispers he wont know what you put in his hand  taliesin youre not there  marisha he will know hes a fortune teller for christs sake  liam five plumbing washers  laura should i /none/ put five or 15 for each of us  taliesin five for the moment he knows theres three of us  matt he places it into a small side pouch what do you wish to be read for he takes the cards  and begins shuffling  taliesin we search for a garment we search for a man  matt his way of shuffling cards is interesting as opposed to the usual like double shuffle he  picks up the deck in one hand and splits it and then shuffles it together turns it around splits  it and then /none/ shuffles it together on each side its this weird boy with a crystal in labyrinth  but with a card deck its wild as he stays still looking past all of you  taliesin and we search for answers towards the future that we inevitably run to  matt the shuffling stops and he grabs the deck you search for a garment and he takes two cards  out and throws them across the center of the blanket for you guys you guys step back and take  a look one of them appears to have a fire or a /none/ camp flame with smoke pouring up out of it and  the other one appears to have a storm a torrent of water and he goes this garment you seek it  looks to be in motion moving if you seek this garment here may haste take you your second  question what were you saying in the second one  taliesin we search for a man  laura with one eye  taliesin well i didnt say that far  marisha a merchant warrior missing  taliesin he doesnt need that hes fine  matt what did you say /none/  taliesin oh we search for a man  matt pulls up two more cards and throws them and they land almost exactly in the same place as the  other two cards that he tossed before they scoot to a stop one card appears to be mostly blank  except it carries some sort of a stylized symbol or letter that you dont recognize and the other  one appears to be a hand of cards stuffed within a pile of coin you seek this man yet it is not a  man you seek to where the luck /none/ brings you the answers lie and he puts out his hand  taliesin five more five more  matt and the third question  laura can i insight check him as hes reading the cards see if his face twitches at all if it  looks like hes making shit up  matt go for it  laura 21  sam oh the whispers so many whispers how are the cowboys doing travis  travis i stopped looking  sam i can tell you how theyre doing  liam sounds like a sad man right there  taliesin wait lets /none/ consult the cards thats the third question  travis its preseason nobody playing right now  sam oh yeah sure  taliesin the cards say the cowboys are not  sam hey maybe you and me should go to a game sometime  travis i would love to  laura okay and the third question  taliesin we move towards a conflict what should we know what should we be prepared for  matt pulls the two cards forward throws them down landing once again almost precisely on the  same space as the last two tosses they slide to /none/ a stop one of them shows a chasm cracking in the  earth and the other appears to show a singular sunken skull the path is to change historic but  many will fall as the transition is to take take your time wisely for the hourglass runs  quickly  laura goddamn it five more gold  matt is this all of your questions  taliesin that will do yes  matt he bows his head ever so slowly towards you then be pleased and he takes the cards and  shuffles them back into the deck rights them /none/ into a perfect square with one quick move of his hand  and places them back in front puts his hands back on his knees and closes his eyes and puts his  head down theres a pause and he reaches over and grabs a small partially eaten apple and  chomp  laura i as quietly as possible put another five gold in front of him  matt his chewing stops and he swallows reaches out patting around it and finds the gold coins  puts it into a pocket you ask for one more question what do you /none/ inquire card shuffling  laura did i make the right choice  matt two cards land across the carpet before you one of them shows upon it two hands joining and  the other one shows a symbol of a sun rising over a mountain range he says youve made many  choices but the one you speak of brings unity and a new dawn  laura be pleased  matt he nods be pleased takes the cards up shuffles them back into the deck and sets it  down he goes back into his meditative trance  taliesin i /none/ feel that was money well spent  marisha i guess  laura that was so cool  taliesin well we know we do not necessarily look for a man which is important we know that time  is even more of the essence than we first implied and considering that almost every soothsayer ive  ever met is as crooked as the day is long the word is now out that were looking for them  laura well thats the shade should we head that direction  taliesin we should  laura grog  travis yeah  laura do you /none/ want to bring your rock  travis my what  taliesin we should grab scanlan  liam where is he  matt scanlan is gone  liam well shit  marisha we need one of those leashes for him  liam shorthalt  taliesin lets maintain a certain level of plausible deniability  laura fuck  marisha i come over the earrings scanlan just making sure youre okay wondering where you are  no biggie just checking in  matt as youre walking with your halfelvish friend down one of the nearby alleyways you hear  keyleth speaking over the /town/ earring  sam i say im cool  taliesin were going to die lets get a room  travis all right  matt so you guys make your way towards the shade  laura yes scanlan were heading towards the shade its the big green tent follow  sam clicks tongue yeah  matt your halfelven compadre goes are you all right  sam im cool im cool on these desert nights and i need something to warm me up at night so  thats why i was inquiring about this spice  matt please which spice are you seeking /none/  sam it might not be entirely legal but fusaka  matt he nods it may take a bit of time i know someone who could bring this but i could not  bring you to them theyd have to bring it to you  sam where can we meet  matt well where are you staying  sam im staying outside of the walls in a small encampment but i can meet him sometime tonight  inside the walls  matt where would you need to meet  sam how about where we first met at that same intersection /tavern/ or is that too busy  matt that is far too busy it needs to be private away  sam im sort of a visitor here  matt if you want a place to stay there is lucks run the casino there are back rooms there  sam theres a casino  matt yes  sam hells yes  matt there is the debts respite inn which has its own grasp of lowlifes those are probably the  best bets  sam lets meet in a room at the casino  matt the casino it is which room  sam /none/ the red room im not familiar with this casino ill need some guidance  matt wear a red shirt he will find you in the casino  sam okay that sounds good  matt all right hour past sundown well find you there  sam tonight

travis be cool man be cool  sam enough /none/ to get me through a week of heavy use i want to go on a bender  matt make a deception check  sam a billion more than before 35  taliesin how are you rolling that  matt he gives you a look and bends down  sam ive had a rough few weeks and i need to get away from it all and go to that place  matt he gets close to your face interrupts you and goes i mean this with all due respect  being as small a man as you are you have to /none/ be careful  sam dont tell me what to do i can take it all right  laughter  sam lets just say that when i started using i was your height  laughter  matt he backs off hands up he goes very well the amount you ask i have no specific amount id  have to inquire but i would say to be safe bring about 200 gold pieces with you just in case  sam itll be pure not cut with anything else i want the good stuff  matt he looks at you confused  sam /none/ am i buying cinnamon here  marisha might be  taliesin its going to be a living baby  sam its going to be a pound of turmeric  liam cardamom  sam yes we have a deal lets shake on it  matt he reaches out and takes your hand and you shake very well hour after sundown casino he  brings his cloth up and brings it up over his face for a second and darts into one of the nearby  corners and vanishes  sam where did you guys go hello  laura were at the /none/ shade  sam okay im coming where is that shit where am i i ask around for the shade  matt you eventually find it  marisha scanlan stop panicking i can hear you hyperventilating  sam im sorry ive just never done

with you  sam no ill tell you later  taliesin these earrings are tapped /town/ you know that  sam they could be listening im coming to you  liam pike hears everything  laughter  matt you guys find your way to the shade and its a large circular sandstone wall that has a  pointed tent roof above it held by a singular pole in the center it is segmented into various rooms  that have no ceiling so everyone shares the same roof this is what appears to be a lounge tavern  meaning there are drinks and wine served but each room seems to have a carpeted and pillowed floor  /none/ looks like there

catches up to you guys  laura are we staying here its not very private  taliesin its not very private and privacy is definitely higher on the list  laura can i find a patron that seems chill  matt yeah you look around you can see what looks to be a matronly older woman wearing some  nicer dark purple and black clothing who is sitting there with one big hookah next to her  side by herself with a glass of wine to one of the sides /town/ and is staring into space  taliesin i can literally only see my mother when you describe this image by the way  laughter  taliesin and only you and you know

looking for her  matt there are many merchants that live here  taliesin are there many merchants with one eye  laura shes quite strong actually  marisha some call her a warrior merchant  matt warrior if youre looking for warrior merchants youre probably looking for the  scarbearers  taliesin yes that sounds about right /none/  laura yeah she is a scarbearer are they around here  matt well this definitely narrows down your search the debts respite is where youll want to  go its actually run by one of the heads of their ilk  marisha ilk  taliesin not an animal  matt scarbearers theyre a bit of a roughandtumble lot  laura oh are they  matt they hunt for coin sell what else they find odd jobs some of them maybe not the most up  and legal but they work with a guarantee and the head of their troop /none/ i think runs or at least  partially owns the debts respite  taliesin thank you what are you smoking at the moment by the way  marisha i was just about to ask her the same thing  matt this i dont know raises her hand and one of the various workers there approaches with  another bottle of wine  yes may i help  what is this you put in here blows it in her face  that would be a dusk blossom sage walks away  dusk blossom sage  taliesin its very fragrant  matt /none/ pungent would be the world youre looking for  liam i walk over to keyleth and say ive done this but i dont think i

into my head  travis getting our own  laura yeah we go get our own  matt you guys are brought into one of the small sections of the shade you are given your choice  of various tobaccos while its not a large room per se you can all comfortably lounge in there  its a nice place to get away you can hear the distant sounds of the /none/ city but for the most part  theres a soft violin music that plays towards the center of the area so at least it has a nice  atmosphere to it  travis as were in there do we notice anyone with any large scars walking around  matt make a perception check  travis thisll go great 12  matt you see people with small large scars people with scars all over life out here can be a  little tough at times but no more scarred than most of the people youve encountered in your  lifetime and /none/ definitely nowhere near as scarred as the people youve run with for half of your  lifetime  travis there are no really large scarred people in here  laura good to know thank you

is it bottle service because if this is bottle service  were here for the night  travis okay maybe theres champagne though yes  matt he comes back a little later with these two dark green glass wine bottles that have this  heavy leather wrapped around them and bolted together at certain places it looks like leather  at times but as you get closer you feel its actually hard its almost like a chitinous armor  on the outside of the glass  travis this was meant for me /none/  matt both of these vials are given to you with heavy corks that are waxcoated over the top  here you are  travis oh may i start a tab no fine then i give shit mutters how much do i owe  laura 700  travis 700 heres 800 gold  sam oh my god  matt thank you very much and please do let me know if you require anything

taliesin oh theres no weapon in here  matt youre currently private in the room  taliesin oh were private in the room  marisha i thought this was an open tentcommune thing  matt its an open ceiling but there are rooms segmented by cloth and what looks like sandstone  walls so there are little pockets and alcoves and you guys currently have /none/ one that youre in  right now  taliesin its not no weapons its just no usage of them  liam lets keep them sheathed he said at the gate but we are pretty hidden  taliesin ill just pop it  matt comes off and the cork flies and bounces off one of the nearby walls the smell that comes to  you is extremely strong it resembles a very vinegar turned wine mixed with this for lack of a  better term a very earthy scent its almost herbal medicinal its not at all what you would  /none/ have expected for something so expensive  travis who wants to be first keyleth  marisha fill me up oh wait you want me to go first  laura i want a shot  travis you want a shot  sam percival just took some  matt as it touches your tongue that smell transitions into a very acidic taste it actually  burns your tongue and it goes numb within a matter of seconds it is not a delightful flavor  and as the tongue goes numb the back of the throat goes numb as you swallow as the /none/ numbness  continues down the rest of the body the flavor has not improved at all but it brings this  universal numbness and as the slight pain of the burn subsides you with just but a few sips  become extremely intoxicated but also just numb  liam and marisha how is it  taliesin slurring not very good  laura oh shit  taliesin slurring but if  laura oh hes fucking wasted  marisha i slap him  taliesin slurring you should do that again that felt really good ill do it  laura oh shit  /dung/ sam liquid mdma  marisha i take a sip  laura im not drinking mine here grog  marisha i want to know i take a sip  matt you take a sip and the same sensation takes and the numbness sets in this  slight vibration at the back of the skull elements of this remind you of being very drunk  with but a few sips  liam hey can you hear me yeah you all right  marisha slurring oh holy shit  marisha and taliesin slurring this is so weird  marisha laughs  taliesin slurring /none/ were good  liam i take them by the cheeks can you feel this  taliesin and marisha yeah  liam you can  marisha affirmative grunt  liam can you feel this  taliesin and marisha affirmative grunt  travis does it taste good  taliesin and marisha dissenting grunt  liam do you recommend it  taliesin and marisha noncommittal grunt  laughter  travis highpitched it hurts man oh my god  laura are you going to try it grog  laughter  liam i am not going to have a sip of that right now definitely /none/ sometime but  laura back in the mansion maybe  liam yeah  laura but not when we have to do something tonight  taliesin slurring what do we have to do  laura as charming as you two are right now  travis im going to stopper it and then im going to put the extra bottle in the bag of holding  sam you didnt have any  travis nope  liam just these two  travis laughing money well spent  laura can i step out and find that waiter that we paid for  liam yeah /none/ youre both really cute right now but youre useless  marisha i lean on vax a little bit  laura wonderful beverages you just served us how long does that last  matt depends on how much youre drinking  laura just a tiny bit  matt hour maybe  laura fabulous they came with quite a price tag didnt they  matt its very dangerous to harvest and create yes  laura i could assume what exactly is in  liam yes what are they harvested from  matt he thinks a minute then goes i dont know which /none/ part of the sandkheg it is but it is taken  from the usually venomous bile or spittle of the creature  taliesin slurring thats really good bile  travis its a living thing  laura im assuming i mean back in the city that were from  matt mind you it is refined and pickled by the finest of various it is a delicacy across  ankharel and northern areas of marquet i was merely fulfilling the request of your companion  taliesin slurring no its very good  laura thank you so much where were from usually when /none/ purchasing such a great and expensive  item room service is included im assuming we have somewhere to stay for the night  taliesin slurring i dont think that its that kind of place  matt i mean you are welcome to stay should you pay an evening price yes but that is not part of  the price of the drink of which you have purchased no  laura oh cultural differences good to know  taliesin slurring we have to move  liam hey can you say your full name right now  taliesin slurred percival fredrickstein von /none/ musel klossowski de rolo the third of whitestone  sam dont say the w word  taliesin slurring whitestone  sam okay its fine now  taliesin slurring what shushing  travis how long until you have to meet this guy at the casino  taliesin slurring whyre you talking just shushes  sam what time is it has the sun gone down  matt no you guys woke up maybe two and a half hours ago  taliesin day drinking yes  matt youre maybe getting close to noon the sun last you saw before you got here was /none/ close to the  center of the sky  travis well weve got time to kill right  laura we need to go find the debts respite and maybe get a room  sam is that where were going to sleep tonight  laura thats where the scarbearers are we can get a room here  liam and your deal is this evening yes  sam yeah weve got some time for that  travis so we take off for the debts respite  matt okay whos leading the charge for that  travis no youre not i will  /town/ matt okay go ahead and make an investigation check if you dont mind  sam investigation youre terrible at those  marisha laughing this is everything i wanted  taliesin im so happy right now  laura 26  matt 26 investigation check within ten minutes youve asked the right questions between a number  of various street urchins and street salespersons to be directed straight towards the debts respite  sam i wrote it down correctly matt  matt in following the direction you end up walking up to what looks like a rather  rundownlooking establishment the broken /none/ glass windows and missing front door lead you to think  that perhaps its been abandoned for months looks a little rough and ramshackle  laura but they said this was being guarded by the hand of ord interesting  sam my contact in the underworld said that this was a place that is a known hangout for seedy  types right am i remembering that correctly  laura no the guard at the front of the city told us this was one of the places that you could stay  and it was guarded  matt he said it /none/ was a place you could stay because you were asking for taverns and inns  liam we have accounts from two different people and theyre two different opinions  taliesin its like yelp but better im going to knock knocking  matt as you approach the front door its partially ajar and as you push it open you can see  the inside is a whole different story as your eyes adjust to the interior you find actually a  bustling business of barhands slinging tankards across seven stained wood tables some of the folk  look rather daydrunk similar /none/ to these individuals though it has worn a bit off since  the original sip and most look to be various miscreants or postwork farmers taking a break  the interior is familiar and probably closer to the taverns youre used to in more of the poorer  districts of emon and surrounding cities than some of the more luxurious areas youve recently found  yourselves in vax vex and keyleth actually keyleth make a perception check with  disadvantage  marisha aw i see why youre doing that with disadvantage  matt yes  marisha 17  matt okay /dung/ vex and vax as you guys walk into the room you do catch off in the distance behind a  series of barrels that are stacked and the edge of a shelf that contains rows and rows of glasses  tankards plates and various things you just barely make out what looks to be an androgynous  figure face masked with dark blue and black cloth with a hint of leather armor hiding in the  corner like barely visible to you and you can make out the details due to your very keen ability  to gather your surroundings /none/ quickly  liam is the armor similar to that suit of armor we saw on the other guy  matt nope this is very muddled low leather armor  laura are they wearing a cloak  matt cant tell their backs hidden and theyre quiet  laura so they dont have something up do they have a hood over their head  matt they have a hood and a mask looks to be like a cloth mask wrapped around him  liam im going to hang by the two soberingup twins over here and keep an eye on that person /none/  matt you guys also watch throughout all the various patrons and people that are wandering  about this establishment one figure stands out amongst the others you see a bronzescaled  dragonborn bulky and thick muscular armored in light hides and bracers he clutches an untouched  mug that is brimming with an ambercolored ale and is lost in thought staring off towards one of the  broken windows that leads outside very heavy muscular arms maybe not quite the height of grog  but definitely a similar build  laura tail or no tail  matt sitting down /tavern/ you cant tell  liam you dont know  matt what do you guys do  taliesin slurring were fine  laura wow i guess i walk up to the tavernkeep  matt there is no tavernkeep there are barmaids walking around and passing drinks but there is no  barkeep right now  laura i grab one of the barmaids who do we speak to about a room  matt you would speak to treev and points to the dragonborn who is currently staring out of  the window  laura oh well there we go i walk over /none/  travis i go with her  matt hes spacing out as soon as you approach he goes groans what do you want bothering a  fellow in midfantasy  laura sorry sir  matt what can i do for you  laura were interested in a room for the night actually  matt all right well whats your name  laura vexahlia  matt vexahlia treev treev bonebreaker and grabs your arm as opposed to a handshake like a  fullon forearm meaty grasp treev treev treev bonebreaker current caretaker of this fine  establishment looking for rooms ive /none/ got three available  laura wonderful mind if i sit down  matt at this rate sure i doubt im going to find myself back to that dream anyway what do  you and your rather scrawnylooking friend there have to say  travis i look around  laura were actually here on a rather important mission from emon  matt never been there  laura it was quite a beautiful city not as much anymore  matt well thats unfortunate sometimes cities fall to the lowest despots it happens  laura yes it does  matt rooms  laura /none/ yes three you said  matt three rooms available  laura and how much would those rooms be  matt how many are staying  sam six  laura six of us  matt and your bear  laura well yes but he doesnt take up much space  matt well we have to put a bear tax on this you realize  laura a bear tax  matt yes i havent had a bear here before who knows what damage it can do consider it protection  laura you know what he can sleep outside dont worry dont worry /none/ about the bear  matt all right i take no responsibility what happens to your bear outside  laura thank you  matt thatll run you ten gold per room 30 gold for the night  laura whispers ten gold louder are these really fancy rooms then  matt no god no i dont know where youre from in emon or what the prices are there but here  its expensive  laura every fucking thing is expensive here  taliesin can i attempt to start looking around the room to try and find anything interesting and  try and /none/ be useful  matt make an investigation check with disadvantage  laura can i insight and see if hes just taking fucking advantage of us because were tourists i  dont want to roll that one i want to roll this one  taliesin investigation 12  laura natural 20  marisha oh shit  matt yeah he straightup jacked the price up he can see the foreigner on your face  laura you know what we probably dont need the three rooms they offered us some over at the  shade its fine  matt certainly whatever your business /none/ may be is that all you need  laura are you from taldorei  matt me no not originally  laura no  matt why  laura so you havent heard of draconia can i see from here if he has a tail or not  matt there is no tail behind him  laura have you heard  matt of draconia unfortunately  laura have you heard what happened  matt no  laura draconia has fallen  matt grabs his drink that hes holding up slams it on the table it spills over you fucking with me  /none/ laura no  matt well theres a reason for celebration and just chugs the entire drink in  one go you can see his dragonborn gullet just accepting the entire drink in one gulp sighs  laura well id be happy to tell you more detail for a reasonable price on the rooms  matt laughs sit down all of you 15 gold for the lot all the meaty details sure  laura so we tell him  matt you tell him about everything and he listens in he starts enjoying it and eventually  falls a bit sinking in /none/ the stake of things and eventually that celebration falls to acceptance  taliesin does anyone mind if i fill him in on the future of draconia  sam if you do it in a slurry speech sure  taliesin its going to be slightly slurry but at this point at least im english again we have the  next several weeks we were going to attempt to free the populace from their new lord and master  but in order to do that we are here on a mission were searching for something were searching for  a oneeyed merchant /town/ warrior and a cloak  matt well look if youre looking to hire youve got to explain the task then we do have a  code fuck what the rumors say  taliesin ive never found anyone who doesnt have a code who lived very long to tell about it  matt aye long enough whats the point in living without one thats how you end up shivved  in the stomach and left to bleed in the street what you looking to hire for  taliesin we are looking for the oneeyed merchant warrior who wears the coat of /none/ cabals ruin  matt i know who youre seeking aye mistress asharru  taliesin mistress asharru  marisha we have a name goddamn it  matt shes one of our finest and expensive because of it but friend shes been off for a  week since her last job so mayhaps her schedule is open would have to inquire write me a summary  of your job you have for her ill have it delivered her answer may take a week or so  taliesin we do not have sadly a week or so the dragon falls in two weeks /town/  matt well write her a letter shell receive it and shell return to you when she sees it fit  our business is our business if you dont like it shove off find someone else  taliesin sadly no one else will do not that i want to inquire of the sort of business shes in  because thats inappropriate but is she in the town at least if we were to write her could we  get word to her quickly  matt why i can get word to her immediately but its up to her when she /none/ wants to respond  taliesin is there anything else you can tell me about her  matt he starts giving you a curious look and goes you come in here asking to hire one of my  finest and dont know what work she does  taliesin i know what work she does  matt what work do you need her for  taliesin we need to save the world  matt and you need her help to save the world  taliesin sadly but true we at the very least need her blessing  laura while hes talking can /none/ i keep an eye on the figure in the corner  matt yeah make a perception check  taliesin there are things that have been released upon this earth that will burn everything and  they will make their way here draconia is gone taldorei is gone all swaths of civilization have  been wiped off the earth  matt weve weathered beasts weve weathered dragons here in emon  taliesin not like weve seen  matt so be it but nevertheless you want to hire her youve got to write her a proposal and  he slides across a /none/ piece of parchment with a small quill about it ill deliver it and shell get  back to you when she sees fit  sam does she have a normal price  matt depends on the job youre asking shell set her price  sam okay  laura 30 perception  matt 30 perception the figure is watching all of you intensely but has not moved an inch all  youve seen are the eyes move but theyve been trained on your entire group since you arrived  liam ive been watching  sam okay  travis could i ask /none/ coughs other than gambling what sort of entertainment can you find in this city  matt all sorts of entertainment theres various singers musicians dancers performers if youre  looking for company theres all sorts of entertainment in that regard of all the  spectrums if youre looking for games probably a few months out before we get to any sort of the  gladiatorial events  travis im sorry could you just a bit more on  matt thats months away  liam theres no place for our friend to get into a scrap  matt well you could /none/ certainly find a scrap but none that are sanctioned by the hand and theyll  put you away  liam sorry big man  matt lest you have someone to duel you thats a whole different business  travis what duel  matt thats sanctioned by the law  travis a duel a oneonone duel  matt if you challenge one to a duel and they accept aye  travis in this city its legal anytime high noon midnight when  matt you just have to sanction it by the hand you have to make sure that you both agree /none/ to fight  to the death and the fight has to happen in the bowl of judgment  travis and sam the bowl of judgment  matt sits about the sandherald district outside of the cerulean palace  travis wait is that that super fucking tall thing we saw  matt thats the cerulean palace its quite close to it aye  laura are any items allowed in the bowl or do you have to go in barehanded  matt it depends on the sanctions of the ord and the agreement you come to but fisticuffs are  great for /none/ the gladiatorial events but if youre fighting to the death sometimes its nice to  bring a blade in  marisha so what type of people like to participate in these duels  matt the kind that got nothing to lose the kind that got a point worth proving with their life  those kind doesnt happen often when it does happen its a spectacle  taliesin is there like a lighter fight that can be found  sam arm wrestling match  taliesin arm wrestling or i dont know what would be worse less than  laura ufc  /none/ marisha less than a bowl of judgment  sam cup of truth  laughter  taliesin a wok of truth maybe  marisha bowl of wheaties  liam tablespoon of wrath  laughter  taliesin this is really uncomfortable  matt a few months until the games begin but until then thats about the only way youll find  bloodshed here at least that wont lend you up in prison  travis all right  sam and laura good to know  taliesin im sitting and im starting to compose a letter  laura hows his handwriting  taliesin flouncy /none/  matt youre starting to gain it back what do you write  taliesin im going to show everybody before i hand it in im going to write the truth top to  bottom of the world is peril we are facing a battle and she holds or knows of an item that  would turn the tide and i wish to know its price or know its rental  marisha wow  sam what are you asking her  marisha i feel like thats not going to work  taliesin im holding it before i hand it in im /none/ going to show i dont feel that there is any  deceit there is nothing i can think to say beyond the truth we are either dealing with honest  people or we are not  marisha i have a feeling that yeah  laura what if we just  taliesin im also putting my rank and title and letting them know that im willing to  sam give away vexs title  taliesin im willing to give away vex vex is entirely up for sale no  travis youre planning to recruit this person  taliesin im not looking /none/ to recruit this person im looking to rent or buy an object that she  owns or perhaps even trade and well put 400 gold  marisha just to meet with her  laura just to meet with her  taliesin as an offer of a meeting  liam and marisha thats not bad  matt he takes it he packages in in a small container a leather container  marisha did you put in there that it had to be prompt that it had to be prompt  taliesin and that time is of the essence  matt oh /tavern/ dont worry whistles whistles through his fingers and the figure in the wall  that youd been watching steps forward and slowly walks towards the table holds up the scroll and the  figure leans in covers his mouth and he whispers into the ear of the figure the figure takes the  scroll gives a nod to all of you and walks out of the tavern hell deliver that to her  promptly now be on your way 15 gold  laura oh yes of course thank you for the rooms  matt takes a keyring out and starts /dung/ fudging through the keys pulls a few off and tosses them  to you across the table all right youve got it for a night  liam i heard grog im going to follow out the door go stealth  matt okay you vanish out the door make a perception check  liam 22  matt 22 okay as you glance out the door and pull outside youre going stealth as well you  said roll stealth  liam that is 25  matt 25 okay you turn around the corner just as you see a flash of dark cloth /none/ around the edge of  the debts respite you rush off to the edge and look around the corner way and down the alley you  can see the figure full on arms out to the side rushed behind going into a very fast run down  the shaded hallway  liam shaded hallway  matt the alleyway  liam ill follow  matt okay so you continue to follow  liam at a distance  matt all right following the masked figure you continue to give chance it darts erratically  zigzagging between areas you can see this is /none/ a very trained pattern to lose anybody following  them but youre also trained in following those that wish not to be followed make another  perception check  liam 24  matt you come around one corner and you can see theres a wall that ends there and you see just a  little slip of material pass and as you glance over you can see the figure has jumped down onto  a lower walkway onto what appears to be a recessed sector of this part of ankharel and has already  darted beneath a nearby bridge and /town/ overpass that walks across to another series of buildings you  leap over keeping in the shadow and give chase down that way you turn around underneath the  bridge and you can see underneath the bridge there is an archway that leads into a dark path  down an actual hallway beneath the series of buildings you just saw ahead of you make another  perception check  liam 22  matt 22 you look down the hallway and you see the shadow of the figure framed against what looks  to be another opening on the opposite side /dung/ but the sunlight is coming through you can just see the  dark outline as it darts forward and then leaps off again down the right past that exit you  follow and you look off the side just as you see the figure slink behind one large crate next to a  storage section outside of a warehouse it ducks behind another one darts up to a building that  looks to be shuttered and closed it looks like a furniture store with a little sign at the top that  says a kingly home it moves an empty /none/ rain barrel to the side and slips the leather case  through a hole that was previously hidden by the barrel dropping it inside the building slides  the barrel over it again looks back and forth make another stealth check  liam 25  matt 25 doesnt seem to make notice and then darts off leaping leaping up onto a rooftop and  vanishing off  liam you said a kingly home  matt a kingly home  liam im going to stealth back to the debts respite  matt keeping a very close watch on the path you /none/ took and marking it mentally back to the debts  respite its probably a good mile off from where you guys were if not a little further you guys  continue your conversation go about your own business eventually vax returns with the  information the path of wherever this letter was dropped off to  travis just curious have you ever had the sandkheg hide  matt are you serious  travis yeah im just asking  matt no i aint drinking that bullshit  travis really  matt yeah  travis too stiff for you

desert i prefer my stuff taken from berries and the sweet stuff  travis what do you mean some beast whod make a drink out of some animals whatever  matt have you have some have you tasted it  travis yeah  matt then i guess you know what an animals bum tastes like eh  travis sputters hold on /none/ you mean they squeeze the asshole of something out there  matt oh completely  travis no  matt they

some  travis no  matt make an insight check  travis three  matt you brain is filled with image of whatever creature your imagination has come up with being  held down  travis its a giant /none/ hairy water yak  matt and it is squeezing some sort of yellowish liquid from its abdomen into a glass wine bottle  and youre now looking over at percy and keyleth who had just had sips of this earlier its not  sitting well with your stomach  travis we were gifted a bottle and a couple of my friends had partook  matt cackles  travis they say the stuff we had is aplus  taliesin yes  matt vax now appears

unusual if theres anything iffy about the rooms  matt investigation check  laura oh i would follow suit  matt investigation check  taliesin oh for the love of fucking  matt natural one  taliesin no

investigation check  sam 29  matt /none/ 29 you find dust dead insects a driedout rodent husk and thats it  liam grog you want to bunk up  travis yeah sure are we going two to a room  liam yeah theres

probably honor the offer first if that goes sideways then we have a  backup plan  taliesin its so rare that were actually given an opportunity /none/ to be honest about everything we  might as well try it once see if we like it  sam but do you know where this person receives her messages  liam absolutely  taliesin good  travis where is it  liam well i dont know the names of the streets i remember what it looked like if you want to  follow me its about a mile off it looked like a furniture store a kingly rest  laura and you didnt even have to say jenga  liam wonders never cease  travis a kingly rest all /none/ right  matt what are you guys doing  liam well the casinos tonight the deals off we cant get grog in a fight  laura do you have a red shirt scanlan do we need to get you one  sam do we own anything red grog  travis what  sam do we have anything red  travis we have three fancy robes left  matt you do not own a red shirt but you could probably find one not too difficult  sam

travis can we go back out to the bazaar are far from there or are we still close  matt hes gone through the bazaar youre not too far from it maybe a tenminute walk  travis they sell any weapons  laura and potions we need potions  taliesin trinkets  travis can i look and see if people are selling weapons  matt you walk around and there are weapons being sold /none/  travis are there any exotic weapons  matt no most weapons you find here are ornamental theyre for decoration theyre for  putting above mantelpieces there are various blades that have bolting mechanisms in the back  where you can easily mount them to a wall none of them that you can see at least that are open in  this bazaar for sale are presented as an actual item for warfare  travis okay  taliesin is there a magic shop  matt make an investigation check  taliesin oh god  marisha come on percy roll something /dung/ good thats better  taliesin 19  matt 19 asking about you do come to within the bazaar a small wooden building thats like a hut  but its constructed of dark wood panels it resembles those strange marionette performance boxes  taliesin punch and judy box yeah  matt except it just has this one frazzledlooking young woman standing there with long strands of  curly dark brown hair red lips dark eyeshadow shes eagerly looking out with a sign in the front  that reads oddities and eccentricities  taliesin good day  marisha be pleased  matt /none/ good day  taliesin be pleased  matt be pleased to you as well  taliesin im stocked up on eccentricities but if you have any oddities for sale id be very  interested  matt there are many oddities at my disposal im nisaba  taliesin percival hello  matt what kind of oddities are you looking for  taliesin honestly this is my first time in the city and im trying to get a sense of whats  available for sale and what sorts of things one would find in the city so really im interested  in /none/ touring your stock especially if you have anything exotic  matt well let me show you over the next five minutes she brings out all sorts of strange  knickknacks its essentially a display from the most awkward of vintage salvation armies youve  ever come across  taliesin god weve found a hipster  matt however you do catch a quick flash of what appears to be some small crystalline vials that  appear to be strapped to some sort of leather bandolier  taliesin well thats interesting what do you call that  matt this is for well /none/ a gentleman who passed through many years ago who claimed to be a great  alchemist sold this off when he had come into a lot of debt within the city so i made a good  price no one has really showed much interest in it  taliesin interesting may i may i take a look at it  matt you may  taliesin thank you  matt the leathers finely made if a little worn the chemicals inside one of them does have a  familiar color a deep herbal red this looks to be some sort of /none/ a low to medium level healing  potion most likely from your experience in the use of that the two others are grayish and murky  and dont really draw your attention or anything youre familiar with  taliesin interesting  marisha percy whats that  taliesin i dont know its quite nice though isnt it  marisha well can i do a check on the other two potions to see with my potion knowledge my potion sense  matt make an intelligence check  marisha not bad just straight intelligence 15  matt 15 they do appear to have /none/ been prepared in the way that you prepare magically enchanted vials  for potions themselves but youre not really able to make out just at a glance youd have to spend  quite a time to make out what their nature is  marisha id have to look at it not familiar sorry that looks like a health potion though  taliesin yeah it does look a bit  marisha healthy  sam its like storage wars just buy it who knows whats in there  taliesin what were you hoping to unload for it  matt well knowing that /none/ is now a magic potion of healing and two other magical potions that is a  very valuable belt with its contents i would sell you just the belt for five silver pieces to  include the vials and they do come as a set unfortunately that would run you 275 gold pieces  taliesin now see we dont know what kind of healing potion that is and those other two vials  could have there is an expiration date on those things and how long have you had it  matt weve had it for a number of years /none/  taliesin a number of years well in that case theyve probably gone stale by now i would say 75  gold at the very best  matt chuckles that is not going to work she reaches out and takes the belt away from you and  sets it back down on the inside  taliesin 75 gold will not do you for that then  matt for the belt maybe  taliesin for the belt obviously weve already established that thats in the silver range and  certainly not touching the gold  matt right but youre willing to /none/ have and to offer that 75 gold for it please  taliesin 75 gold for the entire set  matt no its not going to work im sorry  taliesin no and of course that makes sense that a hundred gold for that entire set would be very fair  liam im starting to take a nap against a column standing up  sam just buy it  taliesin 100 gold youve had it for so long  matt make a persuasion check  taliesin this is going to go terribly wheres my persuasion ooh thats almost a number oh /none/ good 16  matt she goes 225 gold for the set  taliesin 200 and an acknowledgement and compliment to your stunning hair im attempting  to flirt very poorly  travis laughing that eyebrow  matt make a charisma check  taliesin yes  matt just a straight charisma modifier to your roll  liam come on snitch  taliesin come on 12  laura you flirted with grass better  matt she goes i appreciate your patronage but i am a patient woman and that is how i hold  business  laughter  travis stonewalled  taliesin /none/ keyleth  marisha yes  taliesin i feel like i should have learned some sort of lesson here im just not entirely sure  what it was  marisha oh you know  taliesin hardly matters i suppose  marisha maybe youll come to it at the end of being in ankharel  travis hey guys i had a thought you know we were all supposed to have a meeting with the king  and i havent been paying attention if anyones watching and we got time to kill should we go  have a talk with the big man /none/  laura or at least put in for an audience  travis yeah who knows if theyll even get to us today  taliesin im sobering up a bit which we should probably do that  laura does it seem like a long walk towards the cerulean palace  matt maybe a 45minute to an hour walk  liam weve got hours and hours before we have to do anything  taliesin we do its 400 in the afternoon  laura what times the sun set here can i ask somebody  matt you ask around it looks to probably /none/ be about four hours from sunset  taliesin perfect  sam all right fine lets go  marisha plus the best way to see a new city is to walk you guys  taliesin wait hold on i have to open my pokémon  matt so you guys are making your way towards the cerulean palace as you approach the large  extremely imposing palace you come upon what looks to be an endless series of stairs that  brings you to the upper platform that is the central portion of the city where the palace seems  to reside /none/ eventually peaking in the sandherald district that you were referred to earlier as the  location of the palace and where the bowl of judgment exists you step up to the very top of  the stairs to find yourself already breathless at the sight of the immense purplebluecolored  palace a dozen towers reach for the clouds the daylight peeking through their slightly  translucent material like glassy waters everfrozen in a fall the central tower the one  that caught your eye that ends in a large cuplike position rises above all of them with a  slight /none/ spiraltype texture to the outside of the palace that is incredibly tall amongst the rest of  the cityscape  as you get closer you can see the main palace structure presents hundreds of arches pointed at  their apex in its structure smaller and smaller as it recesses further into the palace its very  architectural build is a marvel and seems to both have consistency and a chaotic feel to the  placement of some of these arches too in size its a very strange but fascinating structure  you can also see turquoise detailing and trim against /none/ many of the pillars and carvings and  statues that adorn the exterior of the grounds of this palace as you approach what appear to be the  front gates that ascend with a very bright blue turquoise exterior close to 50 hands of ord  patrol various elements of the grounds around it it looks like there are actual pockets of grass  and gardens that exist around the cerulean palace in here the topography changes almost to feel  like it belongs entirely anywhere but the middle of the desert the guards do eye you suspiciously  as /dung/ you approach and you watch as one armored woman her dark hair hidden mostly beneath an  ornate helmet of brass and blue approaches you guys welcome to the cerulean palace i must ask  your business here  laura forgive us for our intrusion we come seeking an audience of jmon sa ord  matt our emperor does not take meetings my apologies but i must ask you to leave  taliesin we are in fact a group of ambassadors from the continent of emon from the cities of  marisha continent of taldorei city of emon it concerns /none/ the fate of the world  matt make a persuasion check  marisha which one  taliesin not that one that one see listen to me im not taking credit for that  marisha 23 no 24  matt 24 let me inquire with the grand maven she turns around her armor clinking and walks  back to the palace leaving you guys there amongst these courtyard grounds a few moments pass before  she returns the doors opening as she descends next to her you see an older woman with these  long ceremonial robes that drag behind her /none/ spilling across the stairs as she descends  seemingly dozens of gemmed bracelets that jingle as she walks with each step she wears a tall  headdress with what looks like brass quills that press behind her head and down her back as she  approaches you all the woman earlier that you spoke to the hand that approached you stays  behind quietly and watches weapon at the ready the woman steps forward with a smile and unlike  the abrasive appearance that most of the hand have given she seems to be more welcoming and gives for the /none/  first time since youve been here a very formal welcoming bow with her hand before her the other  hand out says be pleased everyone  all be pleased  matt i must apologize we were not aware of your arrival here i am the grand maven gameshega  please enter and follow me  travis shes the what  marisha gameshega  matt laura and liam gameshega  marisha gameshega  matt and liam gameshega  taliesin this is good this is very good  matt as she walks past you and the female hand that saw you /none/ earlier steps aside and watches you  as you pass then ends up stepping behind you and flanking keeping a watch from the back as you  guys are led up the final staircase through the front turquoise gates of the cerulean palace and  they close behind you with a resounding impact the impact echoing through these long halls from  the interior massive pointed archways that lead down ornately decorated halls that echo with each  footfall that hits across what looks like endless white and black bespeckled marble  she leads you through a series of hallways /none/ more hands walking past as well as a number of other  robed individuals what appears to be a central chamber that has a number of steps and seats  where it looks like various philosophers are in midheated discussion in once again this same  language that you have not heard on your ears before  you are eventually brought to a very intricate and decorated waiting room with some finely  upholstered silk chairs couches the grand maven stops if you would not mind please have a seat  taliesin of course  sam sure yeah  matt /none/ she walks into a nearby doorway it looks like a single door that leads into a smalllooking room  from the brief moment you have to see it the door closes and you hear a magic sound two minutes  pass five minutes pass ten eerie quiet minutes pass  travis windows in this room  matt no windows in this particular room but you notice as you take a close look the roofs while  they are built of this deep blue almost glasslike thick crystal theyre ever so slightly  translucent and it gives this general blue glow /none/ about the entire room you cant make out any  details from the outside but there is this strange translucence to the entire structure  travis was that the only door to the room  matt there is the hallway that you left behind but there standing in the doorway is the same hand  that approached you guys and has been keeping an eye the entire time  laura hes in the room with us  matt is away from you standing in the large archway hall that led you into this waiting room  laura im up and /none/ pacing the room trying to pace near the door that she went through so i can keep  an ear on the door  travis i walk up to the guard and i say sorry i really should have peed before i came in is  there a privy i could use  matt she glances at you you look like a strapping young man perhaps you can hold onto  that for a time  travis it looks that way but i also have a strappingsized bladder and ive been known to  leave strappingsized messes in corners you /none/ see i dont really come from all this finery so the  side of the wall is just as good with me its just im trying to be polite  matt she leans behind the hallway foreign language just a moment another guard walks up  behind and kicks a bucket into the room  travis thatll do  liam put up or shut up  laura can i hear anything from the other side of the door  matt make a perception check  taliesin im laughing out loud  sam one  matt you have your ear up /none/ against the wall  laura i didnt want to have my ear against the wall i wanted to be subtly doing it  matt well youre subtly doing it and theres nothing you get closer and closer and theres  nothing the rest of you hear magic sounds but youre still eventually the door opens again  and there the grand maven stands again she looks up to the rest of you come with me you have  been granted an audience she steps back into the chamber  laura that happened much easier than i expected  travis thank /none/ you for the bucket ill hold it  laura are you sure grog  liam we were convincing  sam they must know who we are  taliesin trust our luck our luck is going im walking into this  sam anyone says jenga kill everyone we meet  liam its the only plan we have  taliesin im walking into it  marisha yeah  matt you walk into what is a cylindrical chamber of smooth bluepurple quartzlike material with  four strands of heavy chains taut between the ceiling and floor about 15 feet above you no  /none/ other exit you all enter and the door closes behind you the maven still relaxing her arms to  her side her headdress still giving her this ominous presence looks up and theres a impact  shuddering sound suddenly the bland uncharacteristic walls compared to the rest of  the palace begin to slide past the chains now making this rattling sound as the floor itself  seems to be lurching you feel a bit of pressure in the room that wasnt there before youre all  being lifted and the walls now no longer walled in by the rest /none/ of the palace you can now see this  occasional travelingdown line as the spiral on the outside of the tower you once saw now  surrounds you the walls are much thinner than the rest of the palace as you can see through this  somewhattranslucent glass exterior the entirety of emon surrounding you from upon high as it goes  lower and lower as youre lifted higher and higher into this tower  laura this is miraculous  matt its very offputting but beautiful at the same time everythings seen through this  shimmering somewhatrefracted blue passage as /none/ you go higher and higher you can see the  countless homes walls and towers getting smaller and smaller other towers eventually ending as you  go higher in the tower the maven says i request you do not touch the walls please  sam okay  travis i really want to touch the walls  matt the view reveals the entirety of the city around you and beyond that the distant dunes and  the desert that seems to have no end you view a faroff mountainscape a little bit in the northern  direction that just begins to /none/ peek past your view then boom the floor ceases again you all  seem to lurch for a moment yourself an inch before you catch yourself on your feet the maven  catches herself very used to this transition  you now see behind her where it has stopped there is another set of doors similar to the ones  you entered from in the bottom portion of this tower the door opens creak and you can see the  next room is a set of staircases of the same color that slowly curl off and disappear upward above you /none/  please follow me she walks in her robe dragging behind her you guys give enough berth  for it to follow as youre led up the stairway choosing right or left they both lead to the  upper platform in what is the top of the central tower of the cerulean palace  as you enter this room you see close to a hundred dangling silk tapestries from 50 or 60 feet up of  multitudes of different colors rainbowscapes of beautiful translucent cloths and silks gently  flowing with breezes and mingling and mixing into each other around /none/ the outside of the wall high  arched windows on each side and behind what looks to be a large opening reveals passing clouds  surrounding this height and obfuscating certain portions as they meet with the height of this  towers apex  you see a large balcony from the opposite side of the room that is opened from its own similarsized  arch that extends outward it has a railing about four feet up that is an opening that  overlooks in open air all above the city to see  in the center of the chamber you /none/ see a series of steplike platforms circular that rise up upon  each other and in the center you see what seems to be a tall throne of bronze and sapphire that  probably sits ten feet up from the base thin but extremely long and widens towards the top you can  see hundreds of sapphires put into and set into this shiny ruddy metallic material that frames  the entirety of the throne  and there sitting atop this throne you see a slender humanlike entity wearing no jewelry no  ceremonial adornments no crown just a simple /none/ brown cotton shirt over simple elegant pants  bare feet no shoes androgynous and beautiful youre unable to make out the sex of this  creature its not a man nor elf not fey but something somewhat alien almost the skin a  deepset reddish brown smooth and impeccable the features are extremely fine and delicate the eyes  are what catch you black like night but the pupils burning points of molten metal the entity  smiles and stands off the throne now at this height seeing it standing almost as tall as grog  by comparison the limbs /none/ are elongated extends a hand towards you as you step into the chamber  welcome to ankharel heroes of taldorei i am jmon sa ord and it is my pleasure to greet you  and that is where well pick up our session in two weeks  laura oh shit two weeks  matt two weeks  marisha two weeks  sam wow guys we did a lot of strange things  marisha yes that was a weird day  travis its the pharaoh
