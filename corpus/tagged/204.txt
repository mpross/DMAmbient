none	 002419451 matt youd probably have to go around a little bit but yeah you walk around the opposite side  002419451  002424848 of it looking in you can see theres some damage you can see there are holes blown out on  002424848  002429319 the side that you were facing as you curve around you can see where theres a large gaping  002429319  002432394 hole in the side of the cargo hold  002432394  002440388 marisha fjord i know weve heard the story probably a dozen times but can you refresh us on  002440388

none	 ship getting ready to exit or jump off  002543712  002549814 obviously he knew what was coming next then the explosion went and the last thing i saw was the  002549814  002553324 ship as i was being thrown off  002554141  002557721 marisha so you all were doublecrossed clearly  002557721  002604798 travis yeah i dont know why though i didnt see anybody  002609588  002611525 marisha onward i guess  002612071  002614104 laura he made it off safely  002614104  002616701 travis i dont know i assume  002616701  002624434

none	 002653623 wed found a way to work together but apparently not  002654854  002658266 matt as you guys have gotten closer to around the side of the ship where the most extensive damage  002658266  002705207 was taken you can see where the top of the deck and the edges are blackened from a fire that broke  002705207  002711543 out probably during or shortly after the explosion but before it sank fully the edges of  002711543  002715611 the cargo hold that are blown open as soon as you begin to peer in the inside 
none	 you can see the  002715611  002721304 interior is blackened as well amongst the other patches of sea life that have begun to reclaim it  002721304  002730483 as a home and bits of seaweed and general sea vegetation that has begun to find its way inside  002730483  002731863 the empty ship  002731863  002739257 travis ooh as an idea sword in my hand as we start to push in through that hole of the  002739257  002745852 explosion or peer in can i lead with the sword and see if the light andor

none	 space you can see there  003030802  003039587 are no bodies there are no signs of any individuals who were on this ship but you also  003039587  003044957 know from your experience on the sea that those who die at sea usually float to the surface  003044957  003047911 travis and drift  003047911  003054984 matt yes you do see some metallic materials that have grown rusted you can see the shattered  003054984  003101381 crates that i mentioned before a lot of them are burned and destroyed as frumpkin drifts past one  
none	 003101381  003107688 of them you look inside there may have been some metal bars or some sort of a constructiontype  003107688  003113971 iron material but its mostly melted and fused together in fact as frumpkin makes his way  003113971  003117488 around all the elements of metal that were immediately in the vicinity it looks like there  003117488  003123209 was a cannon there were some other bits of all you can make out is debris at this point but  003123209  003128573 other things that were metallic in nature that have since bowed 
dung	 and fused from the heat of the  003128573  003132041 explosion and the fire than ensued thereafter before it sank  003132041  003137049 liam its mucky and dark in there we would have to take a closer look i cannot make out much  003137049  003142448 travis if you dont mind i know this ship better than anybody jester would you come up with me  003142448  003146158 and we can explore the captains quarters might be a good place to start  003146158  003147583 laura of course  003147583  003148795 taliesin do you

none	 weight it brought you to the bottom easier so you didnt have to swim your way  003218673  003223806 underneath but now youre here the cannonball is unnecessary to weigh you down  003223806  003226026 liam were ed harris now  003226026  003233147 matt essentially you arc over and you land on the deck for a moment as you glance around its  003233212  003240048 very spooky to be back in this familiar place in a very different setting its a strange ghostship  003240048  003245109 type chill that runs up your back looking around 
none	 and having flash memories of pulling up the anchor  003245109  003251440 on that side and having conversations over that edge at sea you and vandren having a deep  003251440  003254564 conversation there under the main mast  003255764  003259559 travis his quarters are that way we should push forward  003259559  003301287 laura okay  003301287  003302716 travis swim over  003302716  003309605 matt okay you swim through the door its currently open and the hinges rusted and pulled  003309605  003316656 off and the tops of the doors broken and
