of critical role so to get all  of you up to speed the party has traveled to whitestone partially to free their name of some  negative political ramifications back in their home city of emon and to aid percy in possibly  freeing his hometown of whitestone from the oppression of lord and lady briarwood a couple  who have risen to power over the past five years after slaughtering his family and taking it over  and keeping it all this time  after arriving /town/ they found a very heavy undead presence in the town with giant zombies roaming  the streets as sentinels most of the townsfolk kept under perpetual watch in this slowly  willcrushing atmosphere but as vox machina arrived they began to instill the thoughts of  rebellion stoking those flames once again with the return of the surviving de rolo they began to  sway the peoples minds to make a final stand  during that time they also discovered that percys sister cassandra is also a surviving de  rolo and exists somewhere in castle whitestone seemingly under lock /town/ and key the party began to  systematically take out members of the new nobles who worked underneath the briarwoods setting many  buildings on fire leaving emblems of the de rolo crest across the town and written in the sky and  after an extensive battle began to make their way toward castle whitestone itself burrowing into a  partially collapsed but longremembered secret passage underneath the castle the party rested  for the evening with the help of their recently arrived cleric pike who had managed to project  herself through the will of sarenrae as a spiritual /none/ body given temporary physical form  while they were searching this tunnel it led to the dungeons the prison cells beneath the castle  whitestone where percy once woke up five years before before cassandra helped him escape while  they were walking through those cells they discovered an old woman currently locked down  below there who is asking for the partys aid in freeing her from her imprisonment and last time  we left off you were helping with  laura fake helping  matt fake helping with the lock much to her chagrin  laura yeah and /none/ i had just snapped it off into the locks so that its jammed it  matt yeah youre a terrible person all right so as you snap off the lock and pull away from it  having the strange physical interaction in the darkness around here trinket behind you just  breathing over your shoulder keeping close to you just in case anythings wrong she pulls her hands  away fine huff do as you wish leave me to rot  laura oh well be back dont worry  matt she backs up and sits in the far corner of /none/ the prison cell and huffs  laura i look around has everyone left me  travis the only people that are in the light  laura all right then i follow to where everybody else is going  matt all right  travis she only saw me and  laura me and scanlan  matt and scanlan yeah you all stepped out into the light the rest of you stayed in the shadows  laura okay  matt all right so there are the rest of the cells which vax has gone through and taken some  time to inspect /none/ where you found what appear to be the remnants of individuals who were imprisoned  here and then left to die long rotted their corpses picked apart by various resident rodents  and other creatures after doing your passes the conversation has happened you see no other signs  of life down here this being the sole prisoner currently within the cells below  laura i go and i find scanlan  sam oi  laura so question  sam yes  laura when you cast seeming on us our visual if you made me look like a cow would /none/ i seem like  a cow when i bumped into you or would i seem like a human  sam are you asking me to make you into a cow right now  laura no im saying that if something was different  sam because i think this is not the right time  laura i think that old woman was doing something weird  sam why do you think that  laura because she looked like she had full handses but  sam four hands  laura full  sam oh full hands okay  laura normal sort of /none/ hands but i didnt feel them  sam you didnt feel them you touched her hand and it just passed right through  laura her hand touched me but it didnt  sam thats an illusion of some sort yeah  laura so she was doing some sort of  sam i dont know what but yes if i were to cast seeming on us or some other sort of magic it  would make us look one way but not feel that way  laura i guess its good that we left her then  sam shes a caster /none/ of some sort  laura i dont know  travis can you dispel seeming  sam should we go find out  laura i dont know  travis how would we do that  laura can you dispel seeming  sam i dont know laughing lets go find out  marisha do you have a dispel magic on you right now  sam i have no  marisha oh my god i do  sam well  marisha i learned it  sam oh keyleth  taliesin are we calling everyone over for this conversation  sam i think we /none/ should  travis away from her  laura yeah im far away from her now  sam that prisoner over there is casting magic of some sort  laura i think she had seeming cast on her i dont know if she did it herself or if well i  dont think she was what she appeared to be  taliesin do we want to waste power on somebody whos  sam what if shes  travis an early warning system  sam yeah what if shes a guard  marisha what if shes lady briarwood like what we were /none/ saying thats what im most afraid of  sam well then we should find out now and kill the shit out of her  travis i vote for that  marisha well before we do that lets see who she is i did come prepared though  to dispel magic  laura so you can do dispel magic  marisha i learned it i did  laura stay in the shadows keyleth and cast it on her  travis percy youre wearing what  taliesin im wearing a hat of disguise so that im not immediately identifiable  travis what /none/ are you in disguise as  laura a dude in a hat  taliesin link from the legend of zelda i dont know  sam well youve got to figure it out right now  taliesin im going to figure it out right now just as a reasonable whitestone peasant  matt okay  liam terrible teeth  taliesin trying to blend in  matt by comparison to this troop youre some poor sap who got pulled along but yeah you are  that one questgiver in warcraft that walks way too slow and the party is like come on /none/ move  thats who you look like right now  travis before we dispel magic on her should we have someone put her in their sights in case she  gets a little funky monkey  marisha she will be able to feel it  laura well yeah shell look like shes not herself  taliesin we could also just ask her to drop it  travis we asked her who she was she lied a lot  taliesin well we could ask her to drop the seeming  marisha she lied pretty well too  taliesin she did  /none/ sam i could go talk to her and meanwhile she could be fiddling with her magic behind me  laura do it  marisha you go talk to her ill be prepared  laura ill stay in the shadows with my arrow notched  travis ill stay with scanlan in case things go wrong  marisha i stay next to vex  taliesin i stay in the shadows  liam how close together are the bars to this cell  matt the bars are about four inches apart  liam four inches  laura so my arrow will do much /none/ better than your dagger  liam well no im not saying for you not to but would i be able to comfortably throw through  matt yeah  liam yeah all right im not telling you not to  laura no its fine  matt shed have a little bit of cover  laura shoot your arrow too shoot your dagger whatever  marisha shoot your dagger  sam he doesnt shoot daggers  liam passiveaggressive much  sam all right so i stroll over back to the cell  travis with scanlan also  sam oh flanked by grog /dung/ yes  matt okay  travis not looking friendly neither  matt okay and there is the one torch thats a little off to the side that gives a little bit of  light into this one portion of the dungeon below here shes sat out into the shadows of the far  corner arms crossed you can see a little bit of the light framing her form you make out okay in  the darkness this close as a gnome but you can see that shes just hunched in the corner huffing  in frustration  sam oi old /none/ lady listen we said we were going to come back for you and release you when all was  said and done but we cannot make that promise if you dont tell us the complete truth now we know  that youre using magic of some sort tell us who you really are  matt im sorry what  sam we are smart little people and big people  travis thank you  sam and we can sense that you are casting magic of some sort on yourself to disguise yourself  now i have some familiarity with this so /none/ i make no judgment as to why but please reveal your  true self to us or else we cannot trust you and we will leave you here to rot and possibly die  travis whispered now  marisha now i do it now  laughter  sam now i do it now  travis hopefully quieter than that  matt as keyleth partially in the shadows the form of scanlan small enough to not really obscure  her presence but she nevertheless gestures in the air recites beneath her words the forbidden  druidic languages that coalesce the powers /none/ of nature around at which point theres a dull  flash of energy within the cell some of the nearby straw on the ground gets blown away from  her form from the general push of air the spell disperses and the impact  marisha sorry got a little squirrely on that one  matt the grey hair the tattered clothes all vanish revealing beneath it a woman in her early  midforties or so jet black hair pulled into a tight ponytail but strings of it in front of her  face still in disarray but nowhere near as /none/ wrecked as the previous visage you were presented  with shes wearing nice travel clothes with what looks like some sort of a long dusterlike coat  that is a little ragged you can see theres a little stain from being down here for a while as  soon as this moment hits she pushes back even further pressing herself against the wall arms  to the side  travis there you are  sam i must say you look way better like this  matt happy  sam extremely  travis yes id say so  sam yes so /none/ who are you for real  matt my name is anna and i would like to be set free if you dont mind i can be of assistance to  you i happen to know a lot of information about the people that currently  reside within this castle  sam how would you know anything about them  matt release me and ill tell you  travis you want to be set free  laura tell us and well release you  matt youve been so forthright in your interest in helping such an old and frail woman how /none/ can i  have any sort of guarantee of my safety should i give you the information you seek you could very  well slay me in this cell  travis that might happen if youre not careful  marisha whats percy doing right now wheres percy  laura do you recognize her percy  taliesin yes  matt you very much recognize her you do notice by the way her right hand the sleeve ends there  is no hand there it is just a missing hand and the left hand is visible  travis as far as we /dung/ can see unarmed right  matt yeah  taliesin anna  matt yes  taliesin lets be frank with each other you have two options either you are going to die in this  cell and i promise you you will die in this cell or you are going to convince us why you shouldnt  so i would start talking right now or i swear we will not leave this dungeon before youre dead  matt roll an intimidation check  marisha its pretty good  taliesin 16  matt 16 okay  liam and just as he finishes /none/ talking i throw a dagger a foot away from her head in the wall  matt okay  laura you gave her a fucking dagger and then it flashes back to you right  laughter  matt so the dagger which is thrown whoosh hits the stone wall next to her and jams itself between  two of the stone bricks and gets wedged there for a second she looks over for a second reaches up  for it and grabs the hilt as it vanishes in a puff of smoke  laura you are so fucking lucky it did /dung/ that  laughter  matt she leans forward and stands up and steps into the light and you have a better look of her  now and her face is a little weathered from travel you can see she definitely doesnt appear  to be nobleborn at least shes by no means a homely looking individual but you can see shes  seen the world or elements of it to have those dark lines at the sides of her face whether it be  from smiles or frowning she steps into the light and looks to you this peasant individual /none/ making  these threats and seems partially shaken but keeping her composure in the face of such threats  she says well for one thing ive been here with them for the past five years i helped them  reestablish their current social control of this city when they left it a pile of flames and  rubble and their little experiment beneath the castle  i was one of their chief scientific designers  taliesin tell us about the experiments beneath the castle  matt chuckles youll have to ask sylas or delilah for that i dont have all /none/ the details or  the reasons behind it other than the process i was brought in to construct  marisha can i see if shes lying  matt you can make an insight check  marisha not great  taliesin thats a number  marisha it is a number 16  matt 16 okay you get the sense that shes telling the truth youre not quite sure how far  off the truth but there doesnt seem to be any sort of baldfaced deception in her voice at this  point she speaks with a confidence and a brusqueness of /none/ a person who is frustrated by the  circumstance and has no other choice i wasnt interested in their zealotry or the whispered  dealings just the challenge behind the construction i enjoy challenge challenge that  pays well chuckles i enjoy that even more  taliesin question two what are you doing down here really  matt im down here because my work is done and i wish not to linger with an impending battle i  dont choose sides i merely let them fight while i live another day far far away i wouldnt have  gotten this /none/ far dealing with the people ive dealt with in the past if i had chosen to stick around  under such circumstances so i tried to leave it appears anders saw me packing and decided to gain  a little favor by turning me in so they threw me down here told me to wait out the rest of the  experiment at least until the ziggurat was complete so here i am living amongst rats in a  cell for over a week thats my reward  laura how did you lose the hand  matt experiments can be /none/ dangerous sometimes i dabble with chemicals and alchemical reagents that  can be miscalculated and i paid a price that will be an everpresent reminder until i can find a way  to fix it and there are ways  travis are you looking for ways to get back at the briarwoods  matt based on the way theyve treated me here and their possible intent to not even keep up  their end of the bargain now that im free to walk away perhaps  taliesin can you lead us to cassandra de rolo  matt she turns her /none/ head with a curious look i could yes why do you ask she looks at you very  intently  taliesin that may be what your life is worth  matt so what else do you wish to know what else do you need even to get me out from behind  these bars because im growing very uncomfortable and cold here in this cellar  taliesin i pull forward i look her very deeply in the eye and i say you should know who your  friends are here do you know that were friends and im going to /none/ become friends  im casting friends  matt okay  travis and laura what  travis is good percy casting friends or shadow monster casting friends  sam well never know until he and ripley kill us all  taliesin im getting creepy just for flavor there is definitely some creepy happening  matt okay you stare at her at this point intent pushing yourself toward the bars and shes still  looking you over like shes searching for some sort of an inclination as to why youre so  interested in these particular questions  taliesin youve been truthful /none/ with us so far correct you havent been fudging around or  playing games with us really have you  matt ive no reason to lie worst comes to worst you kill me where i stand or leave me here  to rot what do i have to gain by lying at this point besides youve already proven you can see  through quite a few ruses apparently  taliesin so youd be happy to help us find cassandra de rolo wouldnt you  matt if it gets me out of here and gets me free to do my own /town/ business then yes ill have to get  a few things from my room but i would be more than happy to be free of this desolate landscape  this whole town is a ruin of misery and it has no color it has no culture ive grown bored of it  laura you say youre a scientist  matt yes  laura do you use magic  matt ive no interest in paltry magics im more of one who embraces the sciences as a means of  understanding mystery my whole purpose here was one giant chemical experiment  /none/ laura then who cast seeming on you  matt oh that isnt to say i have dont have my tricks  taliesin anna you will take us to cassandra de rolo you will tell us what you know about whats  in the basement you will tell us where to find lord and lady briarwood and you will tell us  where to find professor anders and for this we may let you go  matt hmm may that word may  taliesin ill let you leave the castle  matt and if i agree to these terms youll release /none/ me at this moment keep me safe until it  is time for me to take my leave  sam we may chain you to a bear but yes  laura this is clarota all fucking over again  taliesin you are at the moment the luckiest person in whitestone do you know why because  youre at the bottom of my list  laughter  taliesin and i take off the hat  laura and marisha oh shit  matt as the peasant image fades for her theres an intensity to her eyes a widening of  realization as /none/ she steps back instinctually with a gasp and there is definite fear in her voice and  her eyes but theres an uncontrollable smile on her face which catches you off guard  percival laughs  marisha shes a nervous laugher  matt well then this certainly explains a lot i have many questions i found your recent work  very fascinating  taliesin i will be happy to give you an up close and very personal demonstration unless of  course you would rather have conversations about other topics  matt well start with the other topics she adjusts /none/ her coat regains her composure and steps  up to the bars expectantly  sam vax  liam all right i come out of the shadows  laura oh god are we really letting her out  sam get a chain ready or a noose of some sort  travis no we have manacles  laura shes got one hand hows that going to be useful  marisha one hand and then one on the bear right  taliesin it means theres only one to shoot off to make sure she wont be a problem  liam i pull out /none/ a pick and i walk up to the gate and i say hes a very good shot shes a very  good shot  laura he poops on things  liam this guy ive watched turn things into the jelly of the month so i would tread very  carefully  marisha and then i peek out of the shadows and go hi giggles  liam shes a nervous laugher  laughter  matt go ahead and make a check lock pick this will be more difficult than normal because  laura i snapped off a thing in there sorry /none/ about that  liam all right im going to use luck  laura youre going to use luck now  sam shall i inspire you  taliesin dont use luck yet  liam its not that bad thats a 20  matt thats a 20 baseline  liam yeah because of my  matt expertise all right 20 is exactly what you needed  liam skadoosh  matt that was the next one so you take a moment you walk up all slick and click  liam wait one sec this never happens  laughter  matt you have to /none/ get down and you spend the next 30 seconds actually managing to get the pin that  she has stuck in there out without actually breaking the spring inside  laura sorry about that  sam fucking doors  liam shut up  laura it never ends  matt about a minute and a half of awkward quiet as the sound of scraping metal and jimmying  thieves tools eventually click  liam were still very tough  laughter  matt and with that ting the lock comes loose and the bars creak open a little bit  laura trinket /none/ watch her  matt grunts the bear which at this point has been barely visible steps  out of the shadows as well  sam bearly  groaning  matt it would be you  liam kill him  matt steps out and presents a very puffedup trinket made to look intimidating growl towards  dr anna ripley  taliesin heres the deal anna you do what we ask you do not betray us you do not make our  life difficult in any way and you have my word that you will leave whitestone unmolested by us  if /none/ i sense the slightest hint if i have a moment where i think that you might make a run for it if  i have a moment where i think you may cough inappropriately i would ask you to think about  everything you did to me and i would like you to know that i have learned so much more than what  you taught me that day and i cannot wait to show you and i will but not until i find you again  matt understood percival well then shall we she steps out of the cell /tavern/ pushes the bar  aside saunters up past you steps over still facing you underneath the torch light  sam should we shackle her  taliesin no  sam oh all right  taliesin itll arouse suspicion  matt id like to gather my things  sam things they let you have things in a prison cell  matt well i dont have them here in the cell theyre in my room  sam we have to go to your room  matt i would like to  laura tell us what you need and well get it for you /dung/ dear  matt very well come and she begins to step up the stairway that leads out of the dungeon  laura can you walk quietly please  matt you can hear the slight chuckle in the darkness she goes i havent lived this long  without learning to step a little gingerly  sam oh boy  liam lets go parading through the castle  taliesin ill follow her  matt okay  sam lets all follow her right  travis we should check any of the other cells  laura we did we already checked them all  /none/ matt as youre walking up the stairs shes talking to you a bit out loud and shes just  saying this whole entire endeavor while it did pay well at the getgo and did pique some of my  curiosity im very happy to see it out of my life after this you guys get to the top of the stairs  and there is a closed wooden door there she comes to the door and listens to it for a second  creak opens it up and looks out huh empty holds the door open and says  who /none/ would like to enter  sam you would like to enter  matt all right just giving the offer and she steps into the room this is the end of a long  hallway that leads to a series of doors on the right and left side and it opens into a large  central entrance chamber to what would be the castle so she steps in shes not going too far  ahead shes being very conscious that based on the fact that she has nothing on her and you are  very well armed it would not behoove /none/ her to attempt to make a run for it  laura do we see anything in the room  taliesin perception is passive as hell right now i am keeping very sharp eye on  matt no i understand looking around shes taking her steps slowly and shes looking around  corners as you guys progress the doors that are there everyones being very quiet just the very  gentle sounds of careful footsteps against the smooth stone floor footsteps she turns around  looking at the rest of you a little confused and goes huh usually there are a /none/ lot more  individuals frequenting this castle  sam maybe theyve been drawn out by the thing that we incited outside thats been going on for  like 45 minutes now  marisha feels like a trap  laura no but there is fighting can we hear fighting  matt youre inside the castle right now you could go and if you want to try and enter one of  the rooms to the right or left you can see if theres a window  sam are there any open doors  matt all the doors are currently closed  /none/ liam i just want to see if i sense anything around  matt okay  liam 23  matt perception  liam perception yeah  matt okay you take a moment and listen around silent still its unnerving  sam does she have a window in her room  matt you asking  sam were at her doorway arent we  matt no youve just stepped up to the base floor of the castle youre on the base floor on the  side of it youre not even quite sure which way is north  travis nobody were looking for /none/ is going to be above us right theyre going to be below the  castle  sam for sure  travis so we dont want her to get her shit in her room we need to be asking how to get below  the castle  taliesin well get there  sam what are you getting  marisha she wants her weapons  taliesin and i want to see what shes built anyway  sam why would we let her have a weapon  travis were not going to  laura cant we look at what shes built after we /none/ fight them  sam it could be useful  taliesin as were walking i just want to very gently take my gun  sam and shoot her with it  laughter  taliesin and just put it gently at her back going nothing personal  im just feeling a bit nervous  matt understood she straightens up a little more and continues walking ever so carefully not  quite leaning her head or making too many large movements but definitely still keeping a  seemingly nervous eye on how quiet the atmosphere is  laura i creep over to one /none/ of the doors in the room and see if i can hear  anything on the other side  matt you dont hear anything inside the room roll a perception check  laura groans 14  matt you hear some slight muffled dull thud noise but you cant really tell how close it is  its very very faint  laura can i see if the door handle is  matt click its open  laura i step to the side and push it open  matt push it open creak the door opens everyone before you whips around hearing /tavern/ the  noise in the silence looking inside it appears to be a longuntouched music room a space for  hosting individuals where you would have small performances and there is a very cold fireplace  in the far corner there is a small circular window that is placed in the center of the room  that has a very thick glass pane with cross bar on it that seems to look out and this is your first  view for you especially since you woke up in the tunnel your first view of the outside  laura and  /none/ matt do you go up to the window and look  laura sure  liam im following my sister in doing the buddy cop thing  matt okay you two coast up to the glass and look out and another cloudcovered slightly drizzly  morning has taken the caldera between the mountains that houses whitestone in this forest  you can see the entire city of whitestone down below this elevated part of topography what you  do see one are large plumes of smoke about six or seven of them all gathered towards what you  can tell now /none/ is the north side of the city which is the closest to you you guys are on the  southwest side of the castle based on the spatial awareness youve now made  marisha where the more upperclass folk would live im assuming  matt go ahead and roll perception check while youre glancing out  marisha sure  liam so close  laura that couldve been so bad 20  matt okay  laura it was like whee oh  matt laughing love those little gasps moments taking a moment you pull your brother in  to point out /none/ where youre looking it looks like the gates to the castle are wide open there are  tracks through the mud that lead down the pathway to the bottom and right where the path from the  castle intersects with the outer wall of whitestone there is a fray going on right now it  looks like the remnants of whatever sort of undead army that wasnt destroyed by you guys combined  with what may have been a number of the individuals who normally guard the castle have  all been momentarily distracted by the rebellion you guys have /none/ started and for the time being at  least have left elements of this castle unguarded  laura nice i would loot but its percivals home do we see anything that looks like it could  be a doorway leading down or anything  sam weve gone up right  laura were on the main level  taliesin were going to try to get my sister first  laura do you know percival how to go under  taliesin yes unless theres something new then yes i was born here  liam before my sister leaves i grab her by /none/ the arm and say listen to me  creaking  liam what is that pizza forget i said that listen to me i do not have a good feeling about  this and i start to undo the cloak thats on me and i want you to wear this and i tie an elven  cloak shut up please i dont need it you will wear this you will stay hidden when it is needed  you almost lost me i almost lost you you will wear this as needed  laura i will wear it thank you  liam /none/ i walk out ahead of her  matt pull the hood up so you get advantage on stealth checks as you guys step into the hallway  and move forward pikes physical form is drifting along you guys as she takes each step you can see  shes stopped a little bit and shes lost in thought for a moment and she looks at the rest of  you and says there is a great evil here its and you can see part of her form flicker and shake  and almost blink for a moment and then she reaches /none/ forward and says somethings willing me  away i ca and with that her form just vanishes  laura oh no  taliesin damn  matt as you feel this warmth on your hand vax and the symbol of sarenrae that you have embedded  in your glove you look down and it has a slight glow to it similar to the color that her divine  energy form had taken and you see it just slowly fade but not entirely the symbol seems to just  have this general very faint radiation a reminder or at least what small /dung/ semblance of a  connection to her in this dark dark place  liam whispering goodbye pike  travis before we move on from that foyer can we see the front door from where were at  matt if you go another 20 30 feet ahead to the end of this hallway it should open up into the  main entrance chamber and you would be able to see the doors  travis so were not there yet okay  taliesin im going to take a moment and i have an epiphany and im going to shift my form into /none/ a  castle guard  matt okay  sam vex what you saw through the window should we move through the castle quickly because its  unguarded  laura i guess theres fighting going on now i dont want to eat right now  taliesin well get it on the break  laura i saw fighting lots of fighting i feel like if were going to move we need to do it  quickly  travis yeah were on a clock  sam okay lets go  taliesin anna i lower the gun and let her move forward  travis /none/ you dont need to lower it  matt she continues forward heads towards the rest of the hallway into the main entrance chamber  of the castle very carefully looking about she gestures to the rest of you to follow and as you  follow along beside her you can see the two large front doors that situate the entrance the main  entrance to whitestone  sam are they open  matt no they are closed  travis i have 20 caltrops can i throw ten of them in front of the door  matt yeah if youd like /none/ to  laughter  matt they scatter and clink against the ground scraping against the stone and eventually coming  to a stop loosely around the two doors which are about eight feet wide each so 16 feet of it so  youre scattering about one every foot and a half  liam i watched him do that and i shrug and i reach into my pack and i throw 30 more of them  matt okay the area has a little more coverage on there but nevertheless there is a nice cluster of  nasty spiked caltrops now  /none/ laura that was a good idea very smart there  travis yeah thank you  sam grog using your noggin  travis one a day  laughter  taliesin was that a thought for the day then dont sprain yourself we need you later  travis im back  laughter  matt ripley starts making her way up the stairs and the staircase ascends for a good 15 feet up  before it splits into two curved stairways that come around to a second landing  to the second floor  marisha so hang on one second real quick hes /none/ dressed as a guard  taliesin yes  marisha im going to go ahead and cast enhance ability on you for charisma  taliesin i dont need it  matt well you do now  taliesin has it worn off  matt it lasts for a minute so yeah its worn off  marisha oh it only lasts for a minute  matt friends only lasts for a minute  taliesin i had enhance charisma on for a while but now its gone so if you do it  what i had is gone  travis pour some sugar on /none/ keyleth  marisha ill do it im going to enhance in case we get busted so youll have advantage on  persuasion rolls  matt okay so you have advantage on all charismabased ability checks  taliesin all right putting that down  marisha also no one forget that we have heroes feast  laura wait if i put the holy oil on things it lasts for a few hours right it lasts for half a  day or something  matt id say it lasts for about an hour after application  taliesin wait until were in the thick /none/ of it  matt the oil will eventually just drift off as it is an oil  laura it dries and stuff  matt yeah it dries and gets rubbed off it lasts about an hour after application  taliesin lets head to her room  matt okay you head up the stairs shes being very quiet about it she comes up to the landing  heads to the first major hallway that opens up into a long set that goes all the way to the  eastern side of the castle you recognize this area this is where a /none/ number of smaller guest  rooms were arranged theres also a reading room around the corner and down the way is where your  fathers study is and around the back is where professor anderss study was she continues  forward and eventually stops at a door halfway down the hall motions to all of you  do you mind  laura what do you want whats in there  matt my belongings  taliesin i want to see what youve been working on  matt all right she opens the door creak  marisha ill wait outside and stand /none/ watch  laura i walk in with her  travis i stay right next to her  matt so in her room its very plainly decorated you know these rooms are generally very well  decorated just in case decorations have been taken off this room looks very minimalistic and  for the most part more for function than anything else you see there is plain sheets on the bed  most of the rooms open space is taken by a long table thats been put here that has a series of  alchemical glassware and you can see what /none/ looks to be small containers that contain different  materials and powders and seems like she does her own work here there are two open drums on the  side and there is this very caustic smell to the air there is an acerbic tinge to the nose as soon  as the room enters theres just this everpresent very heavy fresh rust smell to the  room she walks to the far end underneath the desk that contains this alchemical setup she  pulls a small chest out  taliesin i watch very carefully  matt she brings the /none/ chest to the top she opens it up and on the inside you can see just some  folded clothing she moves the clothing off to the side and she pulls out what looks like relatively  simple leather armor may i  travis very very slowly  laura dont be creepy grog  laughter  travis creepy im going to put her through the wall if she moves in the wrong way  taliesin you know i almost killed you in stillben  matt really  taliesin do you remember  matt huh i didnt know that was you /none/  taliesin i was kind of curious if you had figured it out or not  matt no  laura tell you what ill hold onto that armor for the time being  matt shes partway into it  laura yeah you can take it off well put it in the bag of holding you can put it  on after were done  matt heavy sigh she folds the tunic portion over the chest piece and hands it to you pulls  out some of the arm braces and leg guards and hands those over as well  taliesin /none/ show me your work  matt she goes underneath the chest and she pulls out two small glass vials and sets them on the  side she then reaches underneath and pulls up what looks to be a false bottom of the chest  places it at which point she reaches in and pulls out a metallic construction that you all see looks  not unlike in shape and purpose as the pepperbox that youve seen percy use all this time though  it has only a single barrel and has a small rotating fourpart chamber to it its a /none/ little  more refined than his construction and you can see now part of the alchemical setup she has in  here actually is and you recognize this as you get close part of it is designed in the creation  of ammunition and refining the powder that is used by this process you see a series of notes that  are off to the side that have sketches outlined of your pepperbox though not really accurate almost  like they were recalled from various individuals that had seen it in person and given accounts of  it shes been /none/ keeping a very close log of eyewitness accounts of your weaponry apparently  for some time  sam shes a fangirl  marisha yeah she is  taliesin im disappointed i was expecting something more imaginative  matt laughs youve seen my room have you not i prefer function  taliesin scoffs hack  matt she reaches down and  travis keep your hands away and step back  taliesin well give those to you when its time to leave  matt how am i to defend myself should things go and pardon my term assup  laura are you /town/ planning on fighting with us helping us  matt you say you wont release me until youve finished what youre doing here i assume that what  youre doing here is ending the current reign of those who rule this town i cant assume thats  going to end with a conversation  liam i lean my head in and say the goliath could turn your head into paste now  if you like  laura tell you what well take the weapons and give it to you if we need your help  taliesin let her have the armor /none/ as a sign of good faith  travis what if its enchanted armor  taliesin and give me your ammunition and when its time i will hand some to you  sam so youre leaving her the weapons but no ammo  laura no im taking the weapon  taliesin the weapons useless  laura i dont care  matt she gives you the weapon begrudgingly hands you a pouch about this big thats pretty heavy  containing a series of iron balls inside you can see theres the various instruments she uses for  forging them and crafting them /none/ there across the table she puts her hand out towards you for the  armor she puts it on a little quicker this time because she feels like she had a little victory  she takes a little vial puts it in her pocket she reaches over and grabs a little pouch inside  the side with change puts a little bit of money to the side there  travis what are in those vials  matt she reaches in pulls them out shows them to you and you recognize the color she goes  what you think youre the /none/ only one who doesnt occasionally suffer a wound i have to look after  myself as well its a greater healing potion  travis one of them is or they both are  matt the one she pulled out and showed you  travis what about the other one  laughter  matt really  travis really lest your brains leak out your ears  matt she pulls out the other one this is in case things go really poorly and i need to uphold  my sense of selfpreservation  laura what does that mean  travis yeah what /none/ does that mean  matt sighs angrily  taliesin convince us to let you keep it  matt it allows me to make a fleeting escape on the air as opposed to by foot  laura oh well then give it to me  travis axe  laughter  matt and with that the glass almost shatters with the amount of frustrating force she slams  it into your hand  laura careful thats made of glass darling  travis i was only stretching no need to get testy  matt so you have a potion of flying in your /none/ inventory right now  taliesin and god forbid youll see how gracious were feeling when we find cassandra de rolo  unhurt  sam yeah grog grog with the steal  laura ooh i get a piece of paper  travis shit potion of flying  laura this is awesome  sam all right do you have your shit can we get out of here  matt yes everything else here is of no interest to me she kicks one of the drums on the way out  slips back into the hallway  sam anything you could use percival /none/  taliesin was there any more black powder ive taken all of her ammunition and black powder i  suppose anything else that looks useful to me  matt make an investigation check  taliesin thats intelligence  matt yeah  taliesin oh well hell eight  matt eight you give a quick onceover of the room the place is pretty barren other than the  large drums of what seems like three inches of some weird caustic substance at the bottom  taliesin i hate what youve done with the place  matt its a recurring substance a lot /none/ of the vials are based around it theres a recurring  theme of this caustic liquid throughout all of her instruments  taliesin well have a conversation about what she was trying to do offcamera so i can have a better  understanding of it  matt in what way  taliesin i figure i may poke you later to get a better understanding just so we dont have to  bore other people with her technical accoutrements but i would like at some point an  outofcharacter understanding of what im looking at of what i could discern  /none/ about what im looking at  matt or we could have it on camera  taliesin all right no i just figured itd be i dont want to  laughter  taliesin i want to kill something tonight  laura yeah we were also running out of time  taliesin exactly  laura there are people fighting right now  taliesin committed as much to memory as possible lets go  laura when we defeat the briarwoods you can come back and explore this room to your hearts  content  taliesin touche  marisha itd still be your place /none/  matt now to your sister is it  sam up or down  matt this would be on the other side of this floor  taliesin which room  matt i think you know the room and you know that youre not too far from your sisters room  marisha they let her keep her room  liam see you later i go stealth 20 no 23  matt as you guys make your way across the other side of the hallway back toward the western side  of the castle eventually finding where not far from where your /none/ room was as well as the rooms of your  brother and cassandra theyre all localized in this one area of the castle so you were all  nearby she goes straight to cassandras room goes to the door and doesnt touch it yet  taliesin a quick question before i open this door am i going to have a violent reaction  towards you when i open it  matt i certainly hope not  taliesin good sighs  travis i stand right behind her  taliesin i motion to everyone stay back open the door and i push /dung/ dr ripley into the room  with me behind her  matt okay as you pull the door open creak you push her in the room is dark there is no light  what little bit of light that peeks in from the hallways in the poorlylit interior of the castle  for this time of day you can see there is her canopy bed you can see there is her cabinet in  the corner but the room appears to be dark and empty  taliesin torch  marisha are there any wall sconces around torch wall sconces on /none/ the outside  matt there are a few along the walls that are currently burnt out at this point  travis i take a torch out of the bag of holding and i take the firebrand war hammer ignite it  and hand the torch to percy  matt okay you glance about the room its lived in the actual bed covers themselves are pulled  off you can see she has a vanity mirror cabinet in the far corner its all put away the chairs  open a little like it was stepped out of the room is absent /none/ of anyone  taliesin i walk over to the closet i open it  matt okay you open the closet she has outfits there many of them dont appear to have been worn  in a while  taliesin looking for signs of life with the paper on the desk  matt you search her desk  taliesin yes  matt make an investigation check  taliesin lets have a real roll that will do  marisha thats a really good roll  taliesin thats a natural 20  travis it is  marisha yeah  sam classic percy  /none/ matt all right  taliesin it was doing this on group hug man  matt you go through her vanity cabinet and you find theres small gems there just little  keepsakes of hers things from her childhood you do find there is a tattered portrait of her and  your brothers and you that appears to be partially burned on one side that is kept on its own at the  bottom of the top shelf you can see currently it just shows half of your face her next to you and  your other three brothers to the /none/ side the rest of the family is burned off at the top point but  this was once a portrait that was in one of the hallways that apparently was destroyed in the  initial attack or since then and shes kept this scrap as some sort of memory and hid it within her  cabinet  you also do find a stack of paper a series of partiallywritten notes and ink and quill that are  false stops letters that were partially written and then crossed off or mistakes were made or  they never got finished that are /none/ all written to archibald and they talk about the general unrest  in the city preparation for a possible coming rebellion discussing past failures but the intent  to try again theres a theme through a lot of these notes that this appears to be one of the  methods she was using to communicate in the outside of the castle and was her role in  previous attempts at freeing the people of whitestone  taliesin shes not here  matt you see ripleys also like well if shes not here shes somewhere else in  the castle i /none/ assume  taliesin where would she be  matt i dont spend my time wondering or curious about her wellbeing i just know that she is  usually here  taliesin anna im going to take a leap of faith and believe contrary to all evidence that you  are a smart woman i pull out the gun and i put it to her head now if you were the briarwoods  where would you put my sister  laura an important question here percy are they keeping her or is she here of her own volition  taliesin i /none/ dont know and if you dont know make me believe it  matt i know shes not allowed anywhere near the ziggurat or near our distillery  taliesin distillery i pull the gun away  matt she breathes a sigh of relief thats been largely my project as part of this entire  endeavor all right so when i was brought in here i was tasked to experiment with the design  and create large amounts of a very very delicately prepared acidic compound one that  could dissolve the stone of your whitestone and distill it down into pure /none/ residuum this would allow  the bulk creation of a very powerful magical essence for use in construction materials that we  could instill and use apparently for this ziggurat as well as other such things thus that  was my main reason for being here we were ahead of schedule and i completed the bulk of our  development weeks ago and i no longer had much of a purpose here  marisha ahead of schedule im sorry hi by the way im keyleth we havent really talked yet  what schedule were you trying to keep what was /none/ the deadline  matt we were trying to create enough continuous acid to develop enough residuum to be used in the  reconstruction of the ziggurat once i had developed enough of the compound to where we no  longer had to create more my purpose was complete i had no interest beyond that the rest  is gibberish to me  taliesin so youre telling me that somewhere in this castle there is a storage facility full of caustic  acid that dissolves the very stones of this castle  matt yes  sam i reach out and i /none/ take out my potion of acid resistance and i drink it  laughter  matt okay mark that she looks at you goes yes if youve seen the vents of greenish fume  billowing out in the garden that is where the distillery exhausts to  taliesin well this is interesting  laura ziggurat whats it for  marisha what exactly does it do  sam hurry up time is of the essence  matt i dont know it has something to do with the briarwoods interest in some third party  someone theyve been working with someone ive not /none/ met someone who i have no interest in  inquiring within  marisha a name give us a name girl  matt i was not given a name they dont speak of this individuals name they are very secretive  about it they paid well they gave me land they gave me a title and when things were done i was  to go free which is why i was not happy in which the predicament you found me made me  travis where can we find this ziggurat  matt her eyes trail down to the floor the ziggurat /none/ itself is well based on the tunneling  structure the distillerys direction right beneath the city of whitestone  travis the city or this castle  marisha theyre going to destroy this fucking city  laura is it underneath the sun tree  matt no not the distillery the ziggurat might be  sam wait what  taliesin oh dear  marisha theyre going to yeah  taliesin are they still melting down the whitestone for magical energy  matt no i dont believe so not for weeks we finished that process for quite a bit now  marisha so /none/ youre done melting the whitestone but you still have a whole bunch of this acidic  compound kicking it in a warehouse somewhere  matt well not in a warehouse thats all kept stored underneath the garden of the castle  travis we need to finish clearing this house now i dont know if theyre even here  taliesin wed better move  sam downstairs  taliesin downstairs  matt you were asking about anders though do you wish to pay him a visit  taliesin growls  matt you can see a smile on her face she does not /none/ like anders  marisha shes trying percy percy shes trying to bait you shes trying to waste time right now  come on  matt he was your sisters keeper  marisha shes trying to percy la la la percy come on  laura hes probably with the briarwoods  marisha come on hes not there  liam im off sitting in the shadows but i say percival we need to cut off the head  taliesin is it possible that my sister would be with him  matt its very possible if shes not here  laura anna shut /none/ up  matt very well  laura percival  matt i only say because my whole  laura anna and i notch an arrow and aim it right at her throat shut up  marisha percy  sam where would this professor be  matt i imagine his study its around the corner  taliesin well check his study and then well go  marisha no  taliesin just his study then well go  marisha percy  taliesin even if hes there if shes not there well leave  travis go lead the way  marisha were running out /none/ of time  laura brother run and check the study  liam i start running towards the direction that was described  laura lets go towards the under  taliesin very well  laura lead the way down  matt very well  laura no talking  sam wait were going down  travis yeah were not leaving vax  laura were heading down hes going to catch up  matt she begins making her way towards the landing that leads to the stairway down whereas  you stealth off in that direction you find your way around that corner /none/ go ahead and roll perception  liam as im moving by the way its minor but i take out clarotas sniffs groans metallic cap  and put it on and i also whip out this other cloak that ive been looking at and whip it  around youre not here and now continue on  matt all right so both will attune to you at your next short rest  liam yes all right excellent its fine  laura well youve worn clarotas thing before  liam theres two things moving forward  matt all right make a perception check /none/  liam that is 22  matt all right as you make your way down the hallway you hear what sounds like a muffled  female voice from behind a distant doorway like a small cry in pain or worry  liam do i need to stealth again or am i already stealthed  matt you rolled stealth before this  liam yeah it was like 23 before  matt yeah  liam so im going to move toward that sound carefully  matt okay it leads down there are three doorways on this side of the hallway the central /none/  door there is where you hear the noise coming from  liam okay im sticking my ear to the door and im going to listen for a full minute to see what  i hear  matt you hear a little bit of quiet and a light sobbing then you hear another voice a male voice  an older voice just say quickly shh you be quiet until youre told to speak  they should be close  liam i want to gently try the door handle  matt okay it is not locked it does turn  liam /none/ i want to push it like one inch in and try to peek in  sam just the tip  laura dont  marisha im having deja vu  laura i know weve been here before  matt you glance inside the room and its a nice study and there is a fireplace on one side that  is part of a continuation of a twostory fireplace column that goes up through the castle on this  side there are shelves of books there is a desk in the far corner theres a couple of chairs  laying around from /dung/ this side from what you can see in the center to the back of the room is an  older gentleman wearing a breastplate you can see his very short gray hair a little bit of facial  hair thats grown in but not to a full beard it looks like its been left to go on its own for a  little while and hes currently holding a young woman roughly early twenties or so with dark  brown hair with a couple streaks of white through the sides of the temple holding her by her hair  with /none/ a dagger to her throat saying shh now when i tell you youll say what i told you to  say got it  and you can see she has tears streaking down her face shes like gasping  liam i back up about five steps and very quietly say jenga  laughter  liam and i run at the door and i kick it open and throw at him  sam yeah  taliesin well that happened  sam yeah  matt all righty  laura so we take off running towards him  marisha here we go jenga /none/ fucking asshole  laughter  taliesin dick  marisha its a trap its such a trap  sam of course  matt all right laughs so you have a surprise round  liam yeah  marisha come on sneak attack  matt both those individuals right there go ahead and make your attack  liam what am i looking at  matt okay so as you burst in you can see the mans holding theres the desk behind him right  there papers and stuff scattered on there theres some tables around with some chairs there  are these large /none/ bookshelves that hold this side and theres the fireplace in the far corner right  there flames warming the room theres a small chandelier on the ceiling that has magical light  emanating from it that gives the room this warm glow you dont care right now because youre  throwing a fucking dagger  liam right but hes behind her a bit right  matt yeah hes holding her right there with a dagger to her throat  liam well i recently added the sharpshooter feat so threequarter and half cover means  nothing to me so im going /none/ to aim for his eye thats peeking out the side all three are  going right in his eye  matt okay  liam so heres the first the first is 24  matt thatll hit  liam okay the second is 26 as you can tell ive been screaming monster sounds my voice is a  little ragged 26 on the second  matt hits  liam and 16 on the third  matt 16 misses but the first two strike true  liam the first its three plus seven is ten plus 14 20 26 29 33 39 /none/ thats the first one  and then the second one does four plus six is ten oh but its surprise so the first one is doubled  because its automatically a crit  matt all right so whats that now  liam well it was 39 so now its 60 78 for the first one ten for the second  taliesin i love you  matt okay so 88 points of damage you just went 80 miles per hour on your first turn as you kick  the doors open whoosh the first dagger he sees it coming towards him /none/ for a second and attempts to  dodge out of the way and as he moves this eye out of the way the dagger impact noise right into  this one he screams out screaming in pain as it just plunges into his eye socket not deep enough  to actually hit any brain but enough to definitely take that eye out as any sort of viable  method the second one just hits him in the shoulder and a reaction to that cassandra screams  out no run its a trap at which point he takes his dagger and /none/ just  runs it across her throat  laura softly i dont think its her  its not her  matt you see crimson start to pour down the front as she choking go ahead and roll initiative  liam all right im going to do luck yeah thats a 22  taliesin why would she be saying its a trap if its not her  laura could be a peasant  matt all right okay so youre going first also at this point as you throw the dagger  youre still at the doorway and you hear what sounds /none/ like two sources of metal clanking  together you cant really see a source but you hear other sounds in the room what are you doing  with your action  liam i am running at him and stabbing the shit out of him  matt okay as you cross this boundary i need you to go ahead and immediately make a constitution  saving throw  liam ill use luck again yeah  sam thats two lucks  liam thats 17 for constitution saving throw  matt great all right so as you step across the threshold of the /none/ room the tile in front of you  all of a sudden bursts in a flash of blue painfully cold energy like theres a concentrated  moment of shredding ice  liam am i able to use evasion for that  matt you can technically  liam so if i succeed i take no damage  matt correct okay so you take no damage you dart across just managing to use that momentum  and your intensity toward this horrible moment that just happened before you and you feel the  explosion happen behind you you just manage to pass /none/ beyond it you rush forward to him all  right and hes dropped her to the ground now shes fallen onto her hands and knees  liam im going into his guts  matt okay  liam so first attack is a 25 second attack is a 20 and the third attack is a 26  one two three  matt one two three  liam oh and im going to turn the poison on for the poison dagger which im going to use for the  second  laura just flip the little switch  liam well it just /none/ drips so nine for the first eight for the second plus the poison is shit i  didnt copy it down here i think its 1d12 lets say its 1d12 because i cant remember if anyone  wants to correct me they can five points of poison added to the five is 13 and then the last  dagger is nine  matt okay so as you rush up to him and shank him repeatedly in the side the breastplates  deflecting part of the blow but youre managing to find openings in the side and you go for a /none/  shoulder and jam it underneath his arm through his ribcage and he screams out yelps in pain  and you can see theres blood pouring out the side of his mouth and the daggers returned by  now but theres this giant gaping bleeding wound on the side of his face where one of his eyes is  completely ruined he looks both surprised angered and very very confused about the way  things suddenly happened  liam hello  matt all right so thats your turn  liam thats it im out  matt okay hes going to /none/ go  taliesin goddamn it  liam were six seconds in taliesin  matt first off there were two sets of decorative armor on the sides of the wall that  suddenly have filled with some sort of reddish arcane energy that gives them a solid physical  form and they both step off their pedestals and begin heavy impact making their way towards you  but before all that happens professor anders in front of you wounded and not looking terribly  happy at the moment is going to use his action to attempt to cast confusion on you /none/ so he goes to  step back and grunting just releases his hand in front of you as one functioning eye bores into  you as he screams out you can feel the pressure towards your head go ahead and make a wisdom  saving throw  liam wisdom which i have advantage  matt well wisdom saving throw because of that anyway so  liam that is a 20  matt a 20 the effect shrugs off nothing on you he is going to attempt to step back  liam oh attack him  matt so you get attack /none/ of opportunity on him  liam yeah its a 22  matt 22 okay that does hit  liam eight  matt okay he will use his bonus action and he let me look up the definition of it real fast  okay takes a bonus action as he steps back grunts come take this inspiration to defeat my  foe and he lends an inspiration dice to one of the armored creatures stepping forward towards  you now its their turn both these armored creatures pull out swords and they lift up the  shields that they had to /none/ their sides and they rush into you from two sides right there you see  this as they rush up to you theyre not really touching the ground theyre gliding across it so  the first one is going to attempt to strike you with two attacks of its longsword that is a 14  liam no  matt second one is a 17  liam no  matt all right the second one now is going to go ahead and take two swings at you that is an 18  liam yeah but ill use uncanny dodge  matt /none/ to reduce the damage by half  liam yeah  matt okay so the first strike hits you for 13 points of slashing damage  liam so half that or all of that  matt thatll be half that  liam half that okay so seven  matt there you go and then thats going to be a 24 to hit  liam that hits yeah  matt and this is not halved okay thats 12 points of slashing damage  liam all right  matt okay now to cassandras turn she is on the ground just spilling out her /none/ life essence onto the  ground shes clutching at her throat and is like gasping you hear that horrible sucking sound of  her feeling her life drain from her shes not unconscious but she doesnt have long for this  world all right that brings us to the top of the round the rest of you guys are now rushing i  assume dash motion making your way as fast as you can to that side due to distance you would  all get to the end of this hallway about there  taliesin is that including sprint  /none/ matt well the dash action yeah  taliesin thats full dash  matt

empty it and maybe drip a little on her neck as well  matt okay go for it  marisha maybe hold her /none/ neck make sure it goes down  matt well you have to roll to heal you pull back and its a really unsettling thing as you  pull up her head to try and feed her the potion  liam its 2d4  matt its just a regular healing potion  liam yeah regular its the lowest of the rung moderate i think its called moderate  matt sorry got it right here thats 2d4 plus two  liam so four six and then i want to step in front of her between her and that one and then  /none/ stab the one  matt okay as you take the potion its a messy process you get most of it in her but some of it  drips on the ground but the wound seems to close all the blood goes away on the ground around her  neck from the splashing of the potion which has vanished entirely and you can see shes  gasping  laura thats good  matt shes right on the edge but shes looking pretty rough  liam so is that the bonus action or is that the action  matt that was your /none/ action  liam action okay by the way im realizing i didnt click my boots so i did one two three  before and the third one missed so luckily that worked out but im not clicking those  matt thank you for the reminder so used to dagger dagger dagger im like wait no  liam so i just step between them and thats all i can do yeah  matt okay so you move into there great thats your turn  liam no i mean between her and the closest one to her  taliesin oh yeah weve /none/ got this new thing now thats so much better  matt for those who dont know we have a topdown camera for the players which is really helpful  for them to know  laura whats going on  matt so you move  liam i was hoping to stand in front of her yeah like that  matt so you push her aside and get in between the two okay cool that ends your turn  grog youre up  travis dead sprint after percy  matt okay and your speed is  travis 50  liam and taliesin /none/ heavy footsteps  taliesin yeah  marisha whats up grog  matt you can get all the way up into here but thats all you can do this turn yeah so youre  heavy footsteps bounding down the hall you push past percy and rush into the room and you see a  young girl on the ground doubled over barely conscious you see vax stepping in front of these  weird glowing armored creatures and at the back of the room theres a man with bleeding gaping  eye socket  travis what the fuck did you do  /none/ liam welcome to the party  matt all right scanlan youre up  sam im up i run as fast as my little legs will take me 25  matt there you go  sam i cant see them so ill just inspire whos going to get in there next whos behind me  can i inspire people that i cant see  matt i think they have to be in your sight  taliesin you can see me though whether or not you want to inspire me at this point is definitely  debatable  matt you can inspire /none/ somebody else in the hallway if youd like  sam all right they cant even make it in the next turn right  marisha no but well keep it  sam sure i will inspire vex behind me and ill say sings arrows and bows they fire at our  foes and kill them and they make them ghosts they wont let go  sam and laura sing arrows and bows  matt as the beat hits you you feel yourself a little more sure shot with any arrows take your  d10 inspiration die  liam forearms go explosion /none/ noises  laughter  matt all righty so that brings us to all right professor anders now is taking his turn  marisha professor anders  sam professor anders  marisha professor anders  liam mr anderson  matt he sees this giant creature in the room looming and he reaches up and closes up one eye  and goes you do this for me and as he looks at you for a second he releases another spell and  you feel a familiar arcane grasp begin to curl over the back of your mind go ahead and roll a /none/  wisdom saving throw with advantage because of your heroes feast  travis all right okay  liam come on baby one more time  travis 14  matt 14 your brain not tempered against these types of magics and having previously failed you  before you feel your will no longer become your own as now you are an instrument of destruction  controlled by professor anders youve been dominated  taliesin damn it  laura fuck  sam oh no dominate goliath  laura weve got to kill that motherfucker  matt okay i mean he looks to /none/ you and goes kill that one and points to vax and you look  down at vax with a grin as the bloodletting youve wanted so bad  your target lies before you  sam hulk versus wolverine  laughter  matt ending anderss turn  taliesin remember what he did to your beard  travis i know is it me grinning or is it dominated grog  laughter  matt moves to here  taliesin hulk versus wolverine man im excited by that  matt both of these horrors move and shift around now at this moment to get /none/ on each sides of you  giving them both a flanking bonus now its four strikes longsword against you with advantage  double eights cant roll shit  liam why advantage im just curious give it to me but whats the advantage from  matt they have advantage against you because they moved into flanking position  liam because theyre in flanking got it  matt which for those whore curious about it it is an optional rule in the dmg it exists second  attack three and a four i cant roll  taliesin sucking sounds  matt so /none/ this guy just whiffs with both of his weapon strikes  marisha youre sucking his energy  taliesin raspy i have your power  matt natural 20 on the next strike  laura and marisha spoke too soon  matt two natural 20s  taliesin damn it  matt it was a miss and a natural 20 on the first attack and then a natural 20 on the first roll of  the second attack  taliesin goddamn it im sorry  marisha spoke too soon  matt so you take on the first hit  marisha you mock fate /none/ fate punches you in the mouth  matt that would be 16 points of slashing damage and 20 points of slashing damage with the second  strike so a total of 36 points of slashing damage and you can feel this strange angry  vibrating growl coming from within this unhallowed armor that floats before you that ends their go  keyleth youre up  marisha im running like hell running running running can i see can i peek around the corner  just to see  matt you can just peek around the corner and see the circumstance  /none/ marisha can i see cassandra  matt you do yes  marisha healing word  matt okay go ahead and roll  sam do you know its her  taliesin yeah  laura either way whoever it is  sam do you know what she looks like  travis just do what youre going to do

 calling of jenga so go /none/ for it  marisha ill cast it no im just going to keep it at 1st level for now im going to save my  higherlevel ones for cure wounds so im going to cast it at 1st level so thats 1d4 plus my  spellcaster three thats not too bad no sorry 16 no 13  matt 13 okay good to know all righty thats your turn vex youre up  laura so im with anna trinket i tell him to hold onto her and drag her along with us  matt okay  laura so he clamps down /none/ on her arm  matt so one two hes going to attempt to grapple her go ahead and roll an athletics check  with advantage because shes not expecting it  laura 16  matt okay trinket grabs onto the scruff of her coat and begins pushing forward they both get the  rest of half of his movement because hes forcing her forward thats as far as he can get  laura but i can keep running i can run all the way up  matt whats your speed is it 30  laura 30  matt you get /none/ about there right at the edge  laura so i can shoot an arrow  matt no thats your movement and then your dash action to get there  laura okay cool  matt all right ripley is just going to stay put for the time being shes held by a bear and being  pushed along shes just ugh  taliesin with no weapons and no armor  matt leather armor basically  taliesin leather armor yeah  matt percy youre up  taliesin im going to run in i can move six right  matt you can move /none/ six squares yes  taliesin one two can i get a good view of professor anders and maybe get a little cover from  the dining room table  matt you can a little bit yeah  taliesin all right ill take my cover im going to pull out  matt as you walk in around the corner you can see these armor attacking grog his axe forward at  these two armored entities floating in the air you see anders in the corner clutching a hand  over one eye with blood streaking down the face a number of /none/ wounds bleeding out from the armor  already been a rough day for him and your eye slips down and for the first time in a long time  you see on the ground before you clutching her throat no wound or blood splatter but clutching  her throat and breathing heavily your sister cassandra and you look back up at anders and you  feel the burning rage begin to billow up inside you and as you walk in the room towards the  center of the table you guys who are able to see the room you see /none/ now from outside of his  sleeves outside from under his coat theres blackish purple smoke beginning to whoosh billow  out from behind  marisha does it seem more extreme than it has been in the past  matt it seemed pretty extreme in the past it just started you dont know go for it  taliesin bonus i pull off my hat of disguise drop it on the floor and im going to just unload  at that motherfucker  matt as you pull off the hat your image shifts fully to percy at which point anders looks /none/ back  and sees this source of smoke and glances over his hand falls away at a moment of realization  eye goes wide percy  taliesin shot one  matt all right  taliesin oh for the love of god  marisha oh when it counts  sam and marisha ricochet noise  matt in the frustration the rage and such you pull up your gun and as you go to fire the bullet  gets caught in the chamber and it almost ejects the entire barrel from the front of it its not  too difficult to repair /none/ but it definitely upsets the current flow  taliesin im going to attempt to repair it really quickly trying to remember how to do that because  i hate it mumbling  matt is it an action or is it an attack to do should say under the  taliesin action shit  matt yeah so you have to use your next turn to try and repair it  taliesin sighs so im just going to sit and scream a little bit shouting  matt okay you can see that this whole moment here as the smoke pours out from /none/ the front of the  gun you yell out angrily and there is this unnatural bassy reverb from your scream that  shakes the room anders actually takes a step back from this and is looking about the room and finds  himself basically trapped in the far corner of his study  marisha oh you better not  matt that ends your turn  taliesin thats my turn  matt vax  liam im going to use disengage and im going to hop over cassandra towards anders and stab him in  the other eye  matt okay  /none/ liam first attack is 21  matt that hits  liam second attack is 17  matt that hits  liam okay ten on the first ten on the second  matt okay needs to make concentration checks to see if he can maintain his dominate against ten  damage that succeeds and yeah that succeeds so he maintains concentration of his spell but both  daggers you just run up and stab him this angry grunt under your breath with each stab and you can  feel the armor itself is now warm with the pooling blood from the /none/ wounds that you gave him before  hes looking pretty rough  liam so question i asked if i could hit the eye did i hit the eye  matt unfortunately no its one of those things where a sneak attack would be an eye shot for this  one you go and try and stab towards the eye and he pulls away he knows whats coming and uses  that inertia to jam it into his side and stab a second time in there so yeah no purchase in the  eye unfortunately  liam okay and im squared /none/ off right in front of him  matt yeah just right in front of him that ends your turn grog  travis so when youre dominated does that mean charmed  matt essentially you have to follow his orders hes not directly specifically controlling you  right now but he told you attack him so you have to use all the things at your disposal to now  attack him  travis okay i cant try and break the domination or rage  matt nope you get a saving throw at the end of your turn  travis im not /none/ raging  matt youre not raging  travis so i only get two  matt one you step over cassandra impact noise stepping on the back of her leg and find your way  right there which is flanking him between anders so you have advantage on both your attacks  laura shit  travis its a three  laura thats good  travis 21  liam yeah  matt second attack  travis 26  matt both hit go ahead and roll damage  travis really trying not to enjoy this  matt laughs with your flaming war hammer /none/  travis 18 for the first one  matt 18 points of slashing damage no sorry bludgeoning damage  travis bludgeoning yeah and fire 20 21  matt 21 points of bludgeoning and fire damage with the second strike  liam i am on my feet but i am swaying back and forth  matt unexpectedly these two titanic slams hit you from behind the first one throws you into  anders for a second anders then pushes you away and as you are still reeling from the impact you  look up and see the hammer come down and /none/ whack you move your head out in time preventing you  from being squished but the impact hits your shoulder and the side of your neck and your whole  body crumples into itself you cry out in pain instinctively just screams from the hit and  your whole world blurs for a second as youre barely keeping yourself on your feet grog that  ends your turn you can make another saving throw with advantage to try and shrug the effect  travis yeah add wisdom right  matt yes  travis 19  matt 19 with that the /none/ momentary controlled bloodshed fades your mind becomes your own and  what little bit of remorse you may feel for the battered vax in front of you you cant help but  laugh a little bit but then you turn your attention to the one who bent your will and your  rage begins to swell up inside you so that ends your turn scanlan youre up  sam i continue my long journey into the room  matt you just get past there and you can see into the room you have visual on yeah pretty  much everything /none/ in the room from there  sam so i have to make a ranged shot if im to do anything  matt correct yeah  sam what do i see can i see how rough vax is  matt at a glance its hard to tell  liam im bleeding out my mouth  matt hes also facing away from you  sam looks normal to me  matt you see grog and vax facing off the guy in the corner you see two of these large armored  entities  sam okay ill go for them  matt okay /none/  sam wand of magic missiles and ill shoot three at the one at the left thats the first charge  and then use three additional charges on the one on the right  matt okay how many charges were restored in the wand from your last long rest  sam i roll every day and i restored five and i had used five so its back to normal i have  seven total  matt so youre casting three on one and then  sam an additional three on the other  matt okay go for it so thats /none/ 3d4 plus three to each one go for it  sam right 3d4 okay  matt magical sound effects releasing the wand on both flicks of your wrist you can see these  bursts of arcane energy swirl around and slam into each one of these creatures  sam 3d4 plus three is that right is that how it works matt  matt yes  sam okay so five mumbles eight lame and mumbles nine no wait yes nine  matt okay all right explosion noise the impact hits you see the armor shake for a second and  look /none/ angered and frustrated for what a faceless arcane entity in armor could and both heads just  go shhhh and look in your direction simultaneously that ends your turn  sam oh and i will inspire grog sings this is the dawning of the age of agrogius age of  agrogius agrogius  laughter  travis d10  matt the words are lost on you but its a nice theme you take a d10 yeah  travis not quite my jam but ill still take it  matt all right that ends your turn anders frustrated by the whole circumstance /none/ and on the  cusp of a really bad circumstance is going to attempt to cast dimension door  marisha i knew it i knew he was going to do that  liam do i get an attack a reaction attack  matt not unless you have theres a feat that lets you do that  liam no  matt yeah i think its mage slayer  liam i dont have that  matt okay all right  sam do i see him  matt yeah you see him  sam i take out my broken shawm and i piercing /none/ whistle and i cast counterspell on him  matt right because you took that when you leveled up  cheering  matt all right oh lord bards shit  travis laughs shit  sam wait i have to tell a level dont i  matt yeah you can tell me what level  sam do i know because hes a bard what hes doing  matt you are very familiar with the spell it is a 4thlevel spell  sam then i cast it at fourth level  matt okay then there is no roll with that he takes a /none/ moment to finish casting you see theres  a moment where this bit of purple arcane energy familiar to most of you as scanlans escapes begins  to sparkle behind him and as he goes to step into it the shawm shrieks out into the room he  groans reaches up and covers his eye as it almost seems to be shrill to his head and cause the  pain to pulse and the doorway just slams behind him panting  sam uhuh that door is locked motherfucker  laughter  sam get used to it because i am  /none/ laughter  matt yeah thats his turn that was his action hes going to use his bonus action to say come  to my aid quickly hes going to put another inspiration die to the other armor and thats  going to end his turn its now their turn they are both going to come around this one is just  going to move around grog no attack of opportunity because its still in your melee this  one is going to step into range from over here this one is going to turn and go for percy sees  /none/ this billowing as youre stuck there trying to fix the gun and just rushing towards you with its  shield forward its horrible jagged longsword in the air arcing towards you two strikes versus  you thatll be a 19  liam that hits  matt okay first strike you take nine points of slashing damage  liam im down  matt so you go down second strike because its still going for you hits automatically its an  auto critical you fail two death saving throws  liam thats it  matt that ends its turn this one is /none/ now going for you percy first strike  that would be a nine  taliesin no  matt its going to use its inspiration die add nine to that so 18  taliesin 18 thats my armor class  matt evil laugh bards im sorry i dont get to use them very often so that is 11 points of  slashing damage and the other strike oh thats a natural 18 so yeah that will be cocked oh  only eight points of slashing damage  taliesin so 19 points of slashing damage total  matt correct whooshing and its /none/ painful but not a huge thing at this point youre so focused  right now on the weapon all right that ends their turn keyleth youre up  marisha okay can i see vax down which one is he on the ground  matt vax is right there you see him get slashed from behind fall to the ground and you see it  raise a blade again and jam it into his torso pull it out and theres a streak of blood that  just spatters across the ceiling from the force of the arc  taliesin yeah i /none/ think you saw that  marisha okay so im going to move around tuck in the door a bit  matt okay so you move in and you see this as you rush into the room you see this arc  happening  marisha can i tuck right here god im shaking yeah right behind that door  matt right there yeah thatll be pretty much your movement to get there  marisha okay im going to duck down crouch on the floor im going to cast first im going  to god im so nervous im going to use /none/ healing word on vax and heal that motherfucker  matt at what level  marisha youre like down down right  laura hes unconscious  liam and i there wasnt even any rolls for that right  laura no  matt if youre unconscious and a creature hits you you automatically fail a death saving throw  and if its a critical hit which if youre unconscious a hit is an automatic critical its  technically two death saving throws  liam yeah and just to understand the whole breakdown but where do the three rolls come in  laura /none/ if nobody hits you  liam oh if nobody hits got it  matt yeah if nobody hits you and its your turn you roll to see if you but if something keeps  hitting you while youre down can kill you pretty quick  liam got it  matt like two hits  marisha but he just hit zero hit points so whatever i bring will bring him over correct  matt yeah and your death saves go away its per turn per time you go down  marisha okay im just going to do a im sorry a /none/ level one healing word for right now  matt okay  marisha yes which gives you 12 hit points and then im going to use my bonus action to cast  grasping vine and im going to take the vine and im going to wrap it around  matt your source  marisha huh  matt which source  marisha next to me  matt okay so right here  marisha i guess yes  matt okay so out of the wood a vine or its not wood actually this would be a stone wall so  out of a /none/ crack in the wall little bit of material begins to form into a giant vine that forms next to you  what are you doing with it  marisha i want to wrap it around cassandras feet her ankle and i want to  pull her toward me  matt you pull her over to the side and she gets pulled across the ground and shes on her back  now looking up her eyes are a little starryeyed but shes panting looks very confused and her  eyes are still adjusting to the whole circumstance  marisha and i /none/ say hi just hang on and thats my turn  matt yep all right vex youre up  laura okay so i saw him go down

let this be a little more intense  sam with inspiration  laura with inspiration that is wait hold on  liam acrobatics  laura acrobatics  matt yeah  laura oh thats good 17  matt 17 all right with that you rush forward just seeing this /none/ tunnel vision image of vax on the  ground blood pooling under his form you dart forward slam on your knees and begin preparing  the spell as you skid across the stone floor of the study you reach out and your hands meet his  form stopping you in the process just as the surge of healing energy jolts through his body so you can  go ahead and cast it on him  laura okay so im going to cast that at 3rd level so thats 3d8 where are my d8s that was  the worst roll nine /none/  matt so you heal nine hit points  liam thats good  laura thats okay because i slid

athletics check for  trinket  laura right okay its going to count even though it slipped out of my hand its eight  matt eight okay trinket holding onto the scruff of ripleys neck ripley then tugs away  /none/ from the grip reaches into the pouch she had earlier as a bonus action throws down a small  rock that explosion noise fills this entire tunnel here with a 20 by 20 fog cloud apparently  and now that shes disengaged shes going to  marisha she smokebombed out  laura she aint got no weapons  matt nope trinket does get an attack of opportunity on her as she runs past  sam yeah trinket does

there you can take the shots as youre stepping towards him  unloading  taliesin yeah im unloading as i walk towards him  matt so the first one gunshot blasts out the shoulder you can see the bone exposed the metal  breastplate sundered by the bullet as he backs up gasping as youre walking towards him he begins  shouting percival you disappoint us all all you had to /none/ do was die like a good de rolo  taliesin traitor and ive got two more shots next shot  matt this one gunshot into his chest and you can see the actual breastplate bends inward to the  wound and hes choking noise spitting out blood from his mouth as he bends forward this land has  a greater destiny you and that fool ripley you place your faith in toys and dust you seek the  transient truths  taliesin how close am i to him at this point  matt youre stepping up to him  taliesin /none/ perfect  matt and as youre doing this as youre pull the mask down he says i die to rise again we are  his blood  taliesin i put my gun in his mouth to shut him the fuck up youre the face i saw when murder  entered my heart this is your doing and i pull the trigger  matt with that a resounding blast explosion noise echoes through the room the back of his  head just scatters across the wall behind him the top of his head folds in a little bit from the  /none/ lack of a substantial base and he tumbles backwards releasing the gun with a limp splat  onto the ground behind youre still holding the pepperbox in front of you hands shaking as you  hold it there looking at it you can see theres a flash of purple energy across the barrel that  has anderss name across it and fluttering noise the name burns away leaving the barrel blank  taliesin heavy breathing  matt smoke begins to subside a little bit its still there but it seems like at the moment it  has this release aspect /none/ to it  taliesin thats my turn  matt yeah that is your turn vax youre up  liam how close are the suits of armor to me i cant tell  matt theres one over here and theres one technically its right next to you  liam right next to me and am i still prone  matt youre still prone  liam so how much movement does it take to  matt half your movement  liam half my movement  sam dont give him an attack of opportunity  liam no im going to get up and /none/ im going to use disengage  matt as a bonus action okay  liam yeah and im going to skip back into the corner and at this point i can throw one dagger  at that suit of armor so im going to do that  matt yes you can  liam that is 19  matt that hits  liam i have no voice left that is

the fire damage first one  matt okay  travis 18 on the second one  matt okay cool so as you slam your hammer twice into it the armor dents you can see now the  energy thats holding it together is flickering almost like the arcane entity that resides within  it is having a hard time keeping itself in physical form all right that end your turn  unless you want to move or do anything else  travis nope  sam did you hit  matt scanlan youre up  travis yeah twice  /none/ sam okay oh me oh man i cant do anything against these fuckers  marisha yes you can  liam youre scanlan shorthalt  marisha

just do 2d8 all right ill run up actually a little bit closer to the guy closest  to me  matt okay youll get into melee with him if you do /none/  sam what does that mean  matt means if you want to do any ranged attack or spell attack roll you would have disadvantage on  it but otherwise it has no effect  laura he can attack you though because hes right next to you  sam he wont be for long  matt okay  sam so i get up close in like five feet away and then ill just thunderwave him  matt okay  sam i do that thing where frat boys do the chest bump  marisha like come at me bro  sam /none/ yeah grunts  marisha thats awesome  travis quietly we did do that  matt all righty  sam thats just like 2d8  matt yeah okay  liam roll two d8s  matt is this the 1stlevel thunderwave  sam i believe it is yes  matt okay so makes a constitution saving throw no he rolled a natural four so it takes 2d8  thunder damage and he is pushed over the table and then would fall over if it wasnt now drifting  above the ground a few inches rights itself but it did push it away /none/ from you roll 2d8 damage  sam i did its only nine points of damage  matt nine points of thunder damage against that helmed creature all right that brings us to  their turn this creature you just slammed into is going to rush back towards you this ones going  to turn and attack you grog two strikes against you that is a 15  travis misses  matt sorry 25 rolled an 18 naturally  travis hits  matt and that is a 21  travis both hit  matt okay so you take six points of /none/ slashing damage halved to three and nine points slashing  damage halved to five so eight points of slashing damage total two strikes against you  scanlan that is an 18  sam oh yes that hits  matt okay and then a 12  sam hey that misses  matt so you take thats seven plus 11 points of slashing damage whoosh as it goes to strike a  second time you see the second blow coming and just duck out of the way that ends their go next  up is keyleth  marisha so there are two /none/ guys alive right now  matt correct yes  marisha ones on scanlan  matt ones on grog the one on grog is looking a little rough the one near scanlans doing okay  marisha hows cassandra looking next to me  matt shes fine theres no blood theres nothing the wound is gone entirely but other  than that she looks fine  marisha looks fine okay ive got my grasping vine still up im going to wrap it around the guy  thats close to scanlan and just yank him off of scanlan  matt okay this pulls /none/ him over scanlans form and slams him right next to cassandra  marisha okay and then i will just go oh and pop him with my staff  matt go for it  sam you can hit things  marisha yeah i got a big old staff yo im not great at it but i can do it oh thats not bad  16  matt 16 does not hit unfortunately  marisha aw ping  sam hes got armor  marisha it sounded nice though  sam it did  marisha kind of resonated a little  matt shakes /none/ off of it for a second all right so that ends your turn  marisha yep  matt all righty that brings us to vex  laura so im still down on my knees  matt youre still down on your knees your brother got up and rushed off he seems okay  panting taking a breath for himself  laura i look up at percy who is covered in smoke and i grab his hand and i say  percival how are you  matt his head slowly turns towards you the mask still on you can see his /none/ eyes just barely through  the glistening circular glass slots where he looks through the smoke still billowing up from  underneath the head slowly turns towards you  taliesin fine  laura darling take the mask off and i  taliesin i dont have a turn yet  matt no  laura and i shoot at the guy thats attacking grog  matt okay he is technically in melee with you so you get disadvantage on these strikes unless  you want to move away  laura does he get an attack of opportunity though if i scooch back /none/  matt he would unless he didnt take one against you when you ran back because you  disengaged so yes he would  laura okay yeah  matt okay so you move back a step that is a 21  laura hits  matt okay you take nine points of slashing damage as you reach back the creature whoosh  arcs with its sword and manages to strike you  laura bastard  matt roll for your attacks  laura okay that is a 26 and a 23  matt both hit  laura i didnt hunters mark him /none/ because im brilliant yes 15

them both one slams into the armor that one goes underneath the helmet and as it strikes  you hear this horrible echoing screeching screech that echoes as the armor thud falls to  the ground  travis yeah  matt you can take the rest of your movement if you like  laura /none/ i stand up  matt well you were standing up to move back  laura i scooched back right  matt unless you wanted to be like  laura yeah i wanted to be like  matt okay so you pulled back while on the ground release the arrows  laura yeah like up into them  matt there you go all right stand up brush yourself off that ends your go  laura and trinket isnt allowed to move any at all  matt trinket can if you want  laura can he run after her  matt yep /none/ rushes out will get there rushes through the fog and looks over and sees her right  there okay that ends your turn and now its her turn she goes into a full dash and takes off  taliesin does trinket get an attack of opportunity for that  matt trinket does get

that as momentum to rush in  the air go ahead and roll your attack  travis 24  matt 24 hits  travis and 25  matt that hits  travis 20 with fire damage  matt nice  travis and 16 with fire damage  matt gotcha grunts bringing the hammer down the helmet actually gets pushed into /none/ the armor and  has to reform itself before it has a chance to you bring around the hammer and hit the shield  with such force that it pushes it into itself and slams it against the wall you take the back of  the hammer and slam it up under the actual helmet hitting the creature you see the flames burn  across the side of its arcane form causing it to shimmer for a second its looking pretty rough
