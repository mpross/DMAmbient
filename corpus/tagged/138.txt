none	 destroying the longstanding reign and terrorizing assault of the chroma conclave across  the face of taldorei as you finished that chapter defeating raishan and collecting the  remnants of the necromancers sanctum of where the final battle took place you returned with the  unfortunately fallen corpse of your friend scanlan shorthalt you succeeded in the  resurrection however upon returning from vasselheim scanlan coming to consciousness  it was discovered that scanlan was in a place in his life where he needed to take some time with  his estranged and recently discovered daughter and arguments ensued and 
tavern	 agreement was had that  he would step away from vox machina to follow his own path the group took a period to mourn  and then began to decide what their next layer of plans were what loose ends still were held out  there and you made your way to the city of ankharel on the continent of marquet to return  the right hand of ripley the person responsible for assassinating a member of the scarbearers  within the debts respite tavern in the city as you made your way past the bazaar towards the  inn 
none	 on the outside you saw what appeared to be a large humanoid structure built of iron and metal  walking on its own behind a very flashily dressed blond gentleman with goatee and a for lack of a  better term braggartly demeanor who managed to weasel his way into the company of vox machina and  to continue his adventures alongside theirs as his robot friend doty continued to archive it in his  book of his adventures and that is where we left off as you guys step into the relatively empty  interior of the debts respite 
none	 at this hour with this individual taryon darrington in tow  travis is that really his name  laura thats his name  sam still his name  laura taryon darrington  sam still his name  laura we agreed to bring him along because hes paying us  matt correct  laura that is an important fact  matt that is a very important fact  travis oi t tar  sam friends call me tary jumbo  travis tary jumbo  sam no youre jumbo im tary  travis jumbo tar im tary can you spell out your

none	 the page  travis whoa  matt tearing paper noise tears it out and presents it to you rather forcefully just over  taryons head and it is pretty fine calligraphy actually not that you can appreciate it  travis i know  matt it just looks like a god damn scribble  all laugh  laura scribbles  travis mm yes uhhuh thank you  sam youre quite welcome jumbo  travis oh my god behind you  sam what what is it  travis it was nothing im always looking out for this group though thank you

tavern	 individuals that you  remember from before who are kind of masquerading as patrons but each while they have their drink  in front of them they havent touched it and they have their hand on the side of their  sword belts at the bar there is nobody currently manning it and as this conversations occurring  you do see the familiar face of treev bonebreaker the bronze dragonborn who is the scarbearer head  here within the facility turn the corner into the room it looks like hes wiping out what looks to  be a large tankard 
none	 as he kind of like gives it a shine and looks over  well look at that it looks like they all returned its not often you see folks who are at  least trying to stick to their word  laura  well thats us  travis weve been here before  laura  promise keepers yes dear  travis oh  taliesin were trying to stick to our word at the very least  marisha key word is try mainly by avoiding death at this point  matt one would recommend that  marisha yeah  matt yeah

none	 the sword  travis thought you had to oh yeah and it extends but  sam sure  matt do you pass over the hand  laura sure  matt while this is happening you kind of slam it down on the table the giant bronze dragonborn  claw reaches out and grabs it and rakes it forward picks it up and the fingers fall limp in  the grasp and he turns it around in his vision  sniffs its a strange contraption certainly looks like a hand  laura she was a strange woman  matt so youre 
none	 telling me this is the one that took out the mistress asharru  taliesin i put the retort pistol on the table she used one of these devices  matt right right very well  he takes the hand and begins scraping the pistol  back with him as well  taliesin the pistol was just for show it wasnt a gift  matt all right well at least the mistress can lay at rest i thank you for your deed  and he spins his finger in the air and one of the  men at the table gets 
none	 up and walks  out of the room and exits through the  front door behind you  taliesin i wont pretend that we didnt have our own reasons for it but we are grateful that you  recognize that we respect your authority  matt takes some balls to come back here and not have anything to show for it so glad you got  balls all of you except for that one  laura giant balls yeah his im not sure of  taliesin we havent checked his to be fair  sam theyre quite quite lovely

tavern	 dottie drink anything  sam doty  travis right  sam he does not drink  travis then thats two for you ill have two of your  strongest whatevers for blondchin over there  matt all right anyone else  taliesin yes please  matt  round it is and he goes and he gathers up a number of small mugs tankards its  ramshackle in here this essentially acts as a base of operations first and a tavern a distant  second so its barely functional really as a comparable establishment for fine drinks and  atmosphere but it 
none	 works  taliesin heinekens coming basically  matt yeah yeah the drinks are passed around some small talks made with treev discussing  just how things have been pretty lowkey since asharru was killed and you guys last left  there hasnt been an upset there was apparently a vision of some sort of a creature at the top of  the cerulean palace a few days ago  laura really  matt but people were wondering if that was a sighting of devossa and some of the rather  intense historians and younger believers in the myth of devossa 
none	 have been up in a tizzy  and treev just kinda shrugs it off and takes a drink and goes  just what we need is another  bigger fucking dragon  taliesin not for a long time one would hope  matt aye  taliesin so tary  sam yes  taliesin i have to admit im curious where did you get your friend there  sam why i made him  taliesin did you  sam yes i did  taliesin really whats his power hows he powered what runs him im just sort of curious  sam

none	 know  taliesin well just in case youre knocked unconscious by lets say someone sneaking up  behind you and hitting you with a weapon  sam wont happen doty has my back right doty  matt at which point doty crams in right behind and is dwarfing tary in size with the broad  metallic shoulders and is heavy footfalls  taliesin doty did he build you  matt no response  sam im a bit of a tinkerer i can show you a few things if we have a quiet moment not in public  taliesin can you

none	 to do this he is a very convincing person and looked  like he was going through a hard time  laura yes he is  matt and look i understand that and i warned him he knew full well the dangers involved hes  a much stronger man than i am who was i to tell him this and hes very persuasive  laura he is when was the first time you gave it to him  matt not more than maybe a week or two ago  laura thank you thank you for giving them to me

none	 in the distance  as you walk your way back to the castle  the rest of you as you walk through whitestone taryon you watch this beautiful  wonderfully slightly backwards city  taliesin hey okay  sam its amazing  matt its charming  sam yes quaint really  matt yeah and theres a castle they have a castle  sam tourists must love it here  taliesin we do quite well in the on season  marisha yeah yeah in years ago  travis do you mind if you come to the outskirts of the city with

none	 at this point would be to make your way to the unclaimed  gardens in the back of the castle  taliesin i was going to say  marisha castle courtyards  matt for awhile there was no greenery back there the processing and disposing of the excess acids  lead to the green fume that was billowing behind the castle when you first arrived here and  destroyed most of the plant life through your aid and the people who kept the castle those have  been filled in and it looks like the castle grounds are starting to 
none	 recover there is now a  fresh growing season of green back there and that is closed off it is protected  there are guards around and it is away from the general populace of whitestone  travis nice this looks like a great place now if you want your first taste of adventure  you need to bring dottie and come over here  sam doty  travis i have to whisper it because its very secret  sam foureyes shall i trust jumbo here because he seems a bit shady  taliesin yes no you should trust him

none	 sam whats going on out here  travis secret stuff are you ready  sam for what  travis wheres dottie  sam doty hes right behind me as he always is  travis nice so put out your hand like this  sam whats going to happen  travis and take your other hand and you either make a boulder a piece of paper or a pair of  shears right and we do it on three  taliesin to be perfectly honest im not entirely sure whats happening either  marisha youve never played boulder paper shears

none	 right because when attacked within five feet of me he gets to react  matt yep  taliesin what  sam to defend me or to attack  matt to attack the person who attacked you  travis see this is a real good way to figure shit out  taliesin im already excited by this  laura this is true this is smart  travis thanks  laura youre so smart  matt after this round actually for the tension basis of this and for the arrangement for the  circumstance im going to take a break and then 
none	 come back to this so we can give this  the real feel you want to so after this round all right so after  okay so you do seven damage you backhand doty impact sound  travis nine nine damage yeah  matt  and the head turns to the side the tome falls to the ground open on the ground  so the pages fold a little bit and the metallic creature shifting metal back to  you stands up and now goes a full six inches taller than you and then rears back with its  fist

none	 yourself teleportation sound thrust through the trunk of the sun tree and emerging on the  opposite side on the cusp of a deep bowllike valley that goes probably for a good mile and a  half or two miles across before you reach the other side of this crest  liam tary thats two times youve teleported two times  sam gasps oh my god every time its amazing wow thank you thank you all  where are we  taliesin uh  marisha well  matt central cliffkeep  marisha we are in the central cliffkeep  sam 
none	 of  marisha of taldorei and of the central of the cliffkeep mountains  sam so cool  marisha yeah  all laugh  matt you glance around and there are the edges of a forest here a lot of them are stockier  trees and things that live in harsh environments and a lot of them are rooted in cracks in the  ground and portions of the rock that have split open down within this valley you can already see  what appear to be dozens and dozens of trenches that seem to have been dug and there 
none	 are areas  of this valley that appear to have eroded or collapsed  like small long rockslides that are just kind of dotting the edges of the mountain walls  down towards the center you can see also a cluster of dozens and dozens of small abodes  it looks like homes huts structures made of rock this is terra this is the earth ashari  village here currently guarding over the localized rift to the earth elemental plane  you guys are traversing down into it  marisha yep  matt it takes you a short time you 
none	 find one of the paths that kinda zigzags down the side of this  mountain drop and make your way in towards the center the sun is now id say at this time  just over the very top kind of noonish portion of the day you begin to walk your way in and its  very warm here partially because the its northern enough where usually its a colder  temperature on the island dont you even you motherfucker  liam wow you lasered in on that like nobodys business  travis gunshots  matt im a little sensitive 
none	  all laugh  matt but the further down you get it is just the tree line has stopped and it is just rock  stone that is reflecting the light and it is warm youre starting to find yourself sweat in  your full armor as you traverse deeper and deeper into the center of this mountain valley  marisha its always like 20 degrees warmer in the valley  laura laughs terrible  matt disadvantage on the next roll  all laugh  taliesin thank you for turning us into an episode of california yes  liam thats 
none	 a little bit of los angeles actor humor for you guys over in sweden today  travis surfer accent californians  taliesin to get to critical role take the 101 with the 5  to get up to burbank to get to critical role  liam for all you fans in germany thats a little san fernando valley humor  taliesin from beautiful downtown burbank  sam i loved it you can do no wrong  taliesin yeah  matt exactly  marisha i like tary  matt yeah so as you continue downward you get maybe a quartermile into 
none	 this walk  still relatively far from the village before and you recognize this you watch as one of the  nearby trenches earth moving shifts up about two feet in stone and you watch as three  figures step out from within the trench and begin walking towards you  travis are we killing these  marisha stop no no these are grog  travis sorry but  taliesin theyre sending us to the things were going to kill  travis oh okay  marisha everyone wait for a second i step forward a second  matt okay you 
none	 watch as three humanoids approach  travis lambchoplooking motherfucker  sam just a stick just a stick it doesnt do anything  taliesin its from the walking company  matt they are clad in darkened leathers furs  and it looks like a lot of the armor and garb  here is taken from  hunted creatures and animals that have been prepared and tanned here within the sunwracked  center of this mountain valley the two to the flanking the central figure appear to be human  male and female both very short kind of tossed hair then at 
none	 the center you see what appears to  be a surprisingly short but very stocky and thick half orc female as she approaches she  has the hair is woven back into these thick braids that are pulled into a singular what looks  like a topknot on the upper back of her skull her jaw protrudes a bit you can see the two  lower fangs kinda pushing past the lips  marisha is this patisse  matt no this is  travis lower fangs  laura shes a half orc  liam yeah shes got the big teeth 
none	  matt this is rockcaller dryden  laura rockcaller  matt dryden  laura not that i would know that  liam singsong rock caller dryden  sam good old rcd  marisha do i know dryden from before  matt you do  marisha all right  matt this is not the headmaster of the tribe  marisha right  matt but one of the central sentinels thats around this portion here  marisha yeah yeah  matt approaches you and for a moment puts a hand out almost to hail you  and then recognizes your face and 
none	 steps forward  keyleth what brings you to terra  marisha kaitiaki dryden  matt kaitiaki  marisha how are you  matt we are well  marisha have you fared well here recently in the past several months  matt we have hunkered down our business was to make sure  that no more of the rifts befall the same fate of the pyrah  marisha have you talked to cerkonos or korren at all  matt not recently no  marisha we have slayed the chroma conclave all the dragons are dead  matt then this is a 
none	 time for celebration  marisha yes  matt i will pass this along  marisha i was wondering if i could speak to headmaster patisse  matt perhaps but what do you wish to speak on  marisha i am intent on continuing my journey on to the water ashari tribe  and i need information from him  matt to the vesrah very well i could help you with this information if need be  marisha is patisse indisposed  matt no no right this way  marisha i mean it would just be nice to like say hi 
none	 while im here at least  matt very well they turn around and begin to lead you back towards the outskirts of the city  not directly into terra itself but as you approach and walk past you can see the ground  here every ten minutes or so you feel a sudden shift and a slight quake beneath your feet  the landscape here the closer you walk to the center of the village seems to be in this  perpetual state of shifting rock and you watch as different areas kind of collide  areas of stone kind 
none	 of cracking noise and rocks tumble down parts of it break and  crack and reform at one point as you guys are not maybe 200 feet out from the first major  structures the ground has one major spike loud rock slide and you hear this heavy rolling  rumble and you watch as maybe 300 feet off from the side a new pinnacle is formed two big plates  kind of crack jut upward one kind of coasting over the other and coming to a halt there is very  heavy localized seismic activity as part of the 
none	 proximity to the rift of the earth elemental plane  here and you watch as three druids come rushing out of the side of the terra tribe and as they  focus the rocks crumbling noises crumble back down and subside the central mountain landscape  here brought back to a momentary beat of peace and quiet  marisha im like a new yorker on a subway  matt yeah just going straight in  marisha im just like whatever used to this  laura must wreak havoc on the local architexture  travis architexture  laura architexture  marisha 
none	 oh its built weve got infrastructure built for that sort of thing  its fine theyre used to it here  matt right as you progress inward and some of the other terra ashari  laura shut your mouth you wouldnt even know what architecture is  matt different visual representations some appear to be more ornamental jewelry seems to be  here like jewels and metallics used it seems to connote a level of prestige within the tribe  and every individual that walks usually with a cluster or protectors around them or at least  seems to be 
none	 in a place of notable importance within groups seems to be more adorned in this  naturalbased jewelry you know exactly where to go to head straight to the hut  in which the headmaster resides and as  liam and im watching her stride through here with confidence just impressed  marisha rockcaller rockcaller oh jerry how you been hows the kids  liam jerry jerry  marisha jerry jerry  matt what looks to be a heavy wooden doorway built out of a series of tree trunks that are  strapped to this one area just tree trunks 
none	 shifting shifts open and now you see walks a  very tall thin and older like mid60s human male who is adorned in a similar tattoo pattern  as the rockcaller you saw earlier but it seems to reside from the center of the cheeks and through  the jowls and then crosses across the neck and then  across the arms all the way down to the  fingertips  laura quietly tight  matt and there are certain portions which are broken up by hard lines its like this parallel  intersection multiple times as the tattoo progresses 
dung	 down very very loose almost a  flowing central shoulderbased robe that tosses down the front of the body and meets with a long  skirt that drags behind him as he steps out and as he looks over in the direction of you  you can see the eyes are very hardened dark deep brown in color and the sockets are very  weathered his skin texture in general is pretty weathered he looks over towards you  cleanshaven short white hair puts a hand up  keyleth you grace the terra with your presence what can we be 
none	 of service to you for  marisha i stand more in attention more formal  good to see you patisse its been quite some  time  matt you as well  marisha i just came to check in after the recent events in the world make sure everyone was okay  matt everything seems to be fine weve been intent of care to the rift and from the word that  seems to have passed quickly since your arrival over the past few days its come to our attention  that thordak no longer sits in the center of 
none	 the city of emon  marisha thats correct weve also slain his righthand man raishan who seemed to be the  mastermind of the entire orchestration  matt good good and well done  marisha thank you i couldnt have done it without your help and training  so i appreciate that  matt you are but a seed you allowed it to germinate so what do you need  marisha well im intent on continuing on with my aramente now that theres relative peace in the  world the vesrah people are quite insular of course i was wondering 
none	 if you could give me  some advice on how to get there and any advice in general on dealing with them  matt it has been a long time since ive attended any sort of gathering with the vesrah it is for  people of our skill set not the easiest of journeys as many of us are capable of traversing  through the sentinels of nature unfortunately most of the tree life  that exists around vesrah is beneath the water  marisha right  matt so your most likely form of transport will be that of a 
none	 vessel across the waves  marisha whos their headmaster there now do you know  matt the headmaster there uvenda the heart of the tides  marisha uvenda  matt uvenda  marisha uvenda the heart of the tides what can i expect of this uvenda uvenda  matt not what youd expect ill leave it at that  marisha thats very vague of you patisse  matt well what would be the fun if i were to unveil the next fold of your aramente  marisha no youve got a point do you recommend by ship or would flight 
none	 be more appropriate  matt if you have the means that is up to you  marisha all right any other words of encouragement  matt listen closely keep your friends about you that should be sufficient  marisha oh sorry i probably shouldve introduced by the way this is my band ive been  traveling with vox machina and tary tary darrington  sam lovely to meet you i have no idea where we are right now  matt good keep it that way  marisha hes new  laura can i ask a question is that all right

none	 you for your answer thank you  marisha are there any other landmarks or ways of navigation to find them  theyre an island in the middle of the ozmit sea  matt its not the island of usual appearance the beaches and sands of vesrah are built upon a  great circular reef and part of the city lies above part of it lies below  travis quietly sick  marisha quietly awesome  matt look for the white sands beneath the surface some structures will be visible from  above it would lie quite a ways to the 
none	 southwest not too far from the hespit i would recommend  perhaps procuring the service of someone who knows the sea well  marisha yes we were going to look into trying to do that well is there anything you need from me  patisse before we head on  matt no just do your best to have your friends keep the location of our village to themselves  marisha dont worry we have many places wed prefer to keep this way  matt good i trust you all safe journeys keep her safe  taliesin of course  laura

town	  laura i imagine you saying all that as you touch the tree  marisha stammers its been a long few weeks  travis the channel just  marisha only the best only the best  matt you transport from the outskirts of terra find your way back to greyskull keep and walking  towards emon proper you can see now even from the distance as you approach the walls some of  the larger buildings the higher towers and  structures that just barely peek over the wall  you can see are already in the process of repair 
none	 you can see  laura wow that was fast  matt  teams of people that are in currently trying to rebuild and restructure as you enter  from the southern gates of the city and enter the streets its more lively than youve ever seen it  people are returning people are coming back and reclaiming what remains of their homesteads  many of them still intact without a problem  the damage was extensive but not universal in the city  and so id say theres still a good 60 to 70 of the city that is mostly 
none	 without damage and there  are areas that are just destroyed but even those people are picking up reclaiming there appears  to be a process of memorial being constructed on the outskirts of the cloudtop to remember those  who fell in the battle for emon there is also the skyport which was on the outskirts of the  cloudtop and up there you can see the skyship deera  however it looks to have sustained a severe  amount of damage  liam damn it  matt  in the battle and is in the  process of 
none	 also receiving its own repairs  liam son of a bitch  laura oh i hope captain damons all right  marisha yeah  travis oh jesus  laura hes so dreamy  travis heartthrob damon  taliesin hes just gotten a little scar  matt there you go  laura the perfect scar  taliesin yes  matt now hes dangerous damon  marisha cap damon  laura hes got the no hes got the harrison ford  taliesin is this the harrison ford or is it the  scar right below the cheek  so that when he

none	 that she travelled with on the ocean  liam seems dodgy  sam theyre all dead  taliesin theyre not dead they just left her  matt but that crew i will say for the sake of  time is not currently docked at emon  marisha okay  liam she was busy doing pushups on that cruise  matt yeah  taliesin onehanded  laura lets go to the docks you guys today  marisha to the docks  matt you find yourself at the western docks of  emon  liam ter the dercks  marisha ter the 
none	 dercks  taliesin ter the dercks  matt you hear the familiar sound of seagulls and other waterbased fowl  mixed with the creaking of wood from  large ships that are all  making their way in and out of this rather large port here on the side of the ozmit sea you can  see theres a lot of goods coming into the city now as a lot of heavy orders have come from  nearby villages to transport goods as part of the recovery both from the south from the mornset as  well as things that 
none	 were too large to carry by cart from syngorn and have been coming up along  the coast avoiding dagger bay and making their way up to emon there are a number of individuals  around and who would want to spearhead the investigation  marisha im not good at investigating whos good at investigating  laura ill go  liam yeah  matt roll an investigation check  liam ill back you up me too me too  taliesin looks good  laura 19  liam 18 oh youve done me in by one  laura oh by one 
dung	  liam one  matt asking about for a while you eventually  people point you in the  direction of what appears to be an individual named dockmaster abban  marisha dockmaster oban  liam abban  matt abban abban  marisha abban  taliesin abban  marisha abban  matt youre eventually led to this  individual who pointed  out is dressed simply at first glance the clothing he wears just a plain white billowing  shirt nice tailored pants and some boots that go just up to the midcalf dark brownred skin  completely shaved smooth 
none	 bald shining in the sun no facial hair with piercing bluegrey eyes  as soon as you begin to approach hes finishing a conversation with someone and turns to you and  flashes the brightest of white smiles and goes  hello ah you look like you are looking for some help or in aid of something yes no  laura yes  matt youre staring at me what do you want  laura we are i dont know if youve noticed  but the city has just been saved  matt i have noticed it strangely enough ive watched 
none	 it be saved and  laura yes then you maybe saw us in the fray and now after saving this beautiful city we are on  our way to the middle of the fucking sea would somebody be able to take us  matt well are you looking for a to purchase a vessel  laura no to rent a crew of wellseasoned sailors who know their way around the ocean  matt i guess it really depends on the size of the vessel youre taking what ship do you have  taliesin were looking to im cutting in for 
none	 a second  laura sure darling  liam sure  taliesin  charter dear charter youre  looking to charter  laura were looking to charter a ship  matt okay  laura i just learn so much from you you know  taliesin i well this was just  travis barf  laura take over  matt and where are you travelling  taliesin no please  liam ah thats complicated  laura well just very close to hespit actually not far so very far southwest  matt how close to the hespits  liam were hoping for a 
none	 bit of a discount for the group  that is responsible for this city still existing  taliesin shes much better at this than you  marisha oh man  liam give it a second please  taliesin okay  liam doubting thomas  matt i have i apologise i do not follow this train of thought discount  liam sighs do your fucking thing whatever  all laugh  liam i didnt roll any kind of a check i just  got shat upon  but whatever do your thing and i walk off  travis i just got 
none	 shat upon  taliesin i just i dont feel the dice were  necessary at that point  travis laughs shat upon  liam i do i do theyre necessary all the time  all the time except when it comes  travis do i  liam to me go go do your thing do your  thing im gone  matt no you okay vax walks away before he  finishes his point  and doesnt get to make his roll  liam yep  matt okay  liam yeah yeah whatever matthew whatever  matt what  liam 
none	 what roll  matt all right  sam well never know  laura forgive my brother he gets very  embarrassed when he talks  about how much weve saved humble creature  matt im still very confused here youre asking  for a discount why  because the city was saved  laura oh well i wasnt of course not  matt look i dont know who you are  i dont know what youre trying to do here  travis we killed all the dragons  matt but were in the process of trying to  recover the 
town	 economy of what was once a very strong economy of a town that has been under attack  now we cannot offer discounts to anybody because right now were all in financial dire straits  laura understandable  matt so if youre going to ship if youre going to move  if youre going to charter if youre going to purchase its going to have to be the ask  laura were looking to charter a ship full  of sailors who can get us to  a circular reef to the southwest near the hespit  matt captain adella 
none	 that would be your best bet  laura captain adella  matt now  and he points off to the end of one of the  nearest docks theres two that are close by and theres a long row of various ships that are  in the process of being loaded and unloaded but there appears to be one sailing ship  they have some galleys and longships along the side but theres a sailing ship with the sails  currently tied up and bound to the mast and a crew that is lounging on the deck  there is 
none	 a woman towards the edge thats just walking past you cannot make out a lot of details  from this point but he points over  that is captain adella she will be able to  help you  laura thank you so much dockmaster  matt of course now if you wish to charter  speak with her let her know that the  dockmaster is the one that brought you that point and all shall be well  laura wonderful  matt all right good luck travel safe and he turns around and walks aw  laura percy 
none	 do we tip him i dont know how this works  taliesin no i think we just  sam no we do not tip him  laura oh all right  travis can i just ask before we leave how much are the ships that are for sale  matt oh well it depends on the ship that you  are looking for for a longship no crew  of course which is a fairly decent speed  requires maybe 30 to 40 rowers and a handful  of deck hands that would run you about  10000 gold pieces 
none	  laura oh thats it  taliesin thats a longship  travis just let me ask the important questions you all retire  laura we dont even need that  taliesin we need a big we need a bigger ship  travis if i wanted a ship that had lets say this many sails  and came with a crew how much would  that be about  matt are you talking about a fully outfitted galleon  travis that  taliesin yes yes you are  matt i would put that  well i mean the crew youd have 
none	 to pay whatever theyre asking but for the actual  ship the general asking price can range somewhere in around 30000 to 40000 gold pieces  travis 30000 to 40000 pieces thats what  i thought yep thank you  matt right obviously a man of the world  taliesin do you want a galleon grog  travis these dock pretzels are amazing  sam hes literally picking up dried pieces of  seagull poop  all laugh  taliesin there is this thing for seasickness  with seaweed  laura dock pretzels  travis its not pretty  marisha 
tavern	 grog thats thats not like free peanuts at the tavern  taliesin thats not thats  laura that was so gross  travis really crunchy  marisha the profile of that  laura oh my god  liam theres protein in everything everything  travis well lets go get a ship  laura oh my god wow we could seriously  buy a ship  taliesin we could or we could just  laura i mean we have no need for a ship  taliesin what are we going to do when were done with it  laura i know 
none	 right  taliesin i know really  laura weve gotta be frugal even though we dont have to be we should be  taliesin its not even frugal this is just what  you do once you have money  laura exactly  taliesin  you only buy things you need and just lease everything else  its very very common its all good  laura all right  taliesin this is very true  matt all righty as you guys walk to the edge  of the  taliesin leasing  liam its true  matt aforementioned dock that 
none	 was pointed out  you come to the outskirts of this larger sailing ship and as you begin to walk up  and your footfalls clackclack clackclack clack against the dock a couple of the  deckhands that are kind of leaning off to the side kind of just looking up one of them appears  to be taking a hit off of a flask of some kind both hear the footfalls and get up and turn  around spin and look capn capn  and they kind of point over and the coatwearing figure that you saw walking across 
dung	  the deck of the ship spins around and begins to abruptly quicken her pace in the direction of the  gangplank that leads off onto the side of the dock as she comes up to the edge reaching and  grabbing the sides of it you see before you a woman with long seaair tattered mass of hair  it is just this halo of crimped curled and wild dark hair thats also been sunbleached  to the point where the tips kinda go light it is crazed in appearance immediately as she  arrives she looks spry and 
none	 somewhat young maybe late 20s early 30s but her skin has been  very heavily weathered from all these days at sea and you can see already shes getting these crows  nests at the corners of her face but has a very bright smile and her light brown coat hangs just  past her calfhigh boots she looks like the kind of woman who captains a ship as she glances over  hi you looking for a crew  marisha you look like a pirate  matt i do not look like a pirate why would you say that
