ah welcome to the chaos of live internet all right so lets  liam i dont think we should go any more meta than it has to be  matt lets jump in guys lets jump in so a little bit of overview for those of you who are  just joining us at this point in the story vox machina this intrepid band of adventurers  misfits whatever you must call them completed an adventure through the underdark a very dangerous  cavernous  laura oh sams here  matt oh were gonna let sam in  marisha /none/ sams here  orion yeah he texted  matt all right so after completing this underdark challenge they discovered and managed  to extract an evil artifact known as the horn of orcus that held great power and seemingly has a  partner somewhere in the world that is unknown but the one they have acquired is indestructible  as far as folks know and it was decided by the council of taldorei and vox machina that it  should be sealed away and hopefully forgotten for the rest of eternity the best place to do so came  up /none/ in the conversation to be the city of vasselheim which is on a different continent far  to the northwest of taldorei the kingdom where most of the story as to this point has taken  place to be sealed in what is referred to as the platinum sanctuary the oldest existing temple to  bahamut the good platinum dragon deity so they were given passage on a skyship to cross the ozmit  sea to othanzia the continent that houses the capital city vasselheim so the group gathered  together rode on to the magically elevated skyship and are /none/ traversing the ocean carrying the  horn of orcus within this holy container hello  marisha hi sam  matt sam has joined us  sam hi  matt they found themselves over the ocean suddenly attacked by a band of what seemed to be wyvern  and griffinriding bandits the battle took place on the top of the skyship some of the magic being  taken out a few lives lost but the party managed to persevere take a captive and continue on  their journey the horn of orcus and its container kept safe and thats where we /none/ pick up and begin  sam can you say all of that again for me  laughter  travis you dont listen anyway  matt no  marisha laughs you dont listen anyway  matt all righty so as you guys have settled in the horn safe youve taken a couple more days on  this journey what was told to be about a sixday journey across the ocean six to seven days is  there anything you guys wish to accomplish at this moment  sam are we in the air  matt you are still in the air /none/ on the skyship  sam not much we can do  marisha well we just so we fought off the wyverns  sam oh do we have one we have one  travis is the little magician halfling still being polite and brushing her teeth and stuff  laura oh thats right our little halfling that we  travis who you saved wuss  matt yes  sam shes a mage right  matt that you saved she is a mage and she has also been bound at the orders of the captain so  as not to cause any /none/ issues on the ship while shes there so as to her future after your  conversation with him as to whether or not she could work on this ship based on the fact that  their first meeting involved her and her band attacking and trying to murder his entire crew  captain damon was not too keen on the idea at the time being and decided to lock her up  laura oh  matt so we shall see her fate in the near future  travis shes locked up  laura okay shes locked up  travis shes /none/ got tricks though right  matt she has tricks but there is an antimagic brig built into the ship specifically  for this purpose  sam ooh fancy  travis thats all i needed to know  laura oh thats good to know i was going to pay you to put the kibosh on her  orion shes negged  travis cool  matt laughs so ill say that percy is continuing to read his book the next few days  pass without incident is there anything you want to accomplish anything  orion you said the next few days /none/ without incident cool  travis could i try to further my beard  sam oh yes try to grow a beard  marisha yeah his beard lets go for the beard  matt go ahead and roll another percentage dice  travis yeah its a d20 right  laura its a percentage die  travis oh thats right thats right the two in a row i remember  matt two d10s  travis im learning im learning  marisha yep  matt first one and the second one  travis three eight  matt 38 the little bit of peachfuzz /none/ stubble on the chin of your goliath face begins to slowly  grow its coming out colorless its almost translucent with a hint of gray and white  sam and laura ew  travis im a targaryen baby  laughter  liam thats hot  laura its translucent like  matt a color is there its almost like fishing line is growing out of the bottom of his chin  travis yeah  sam ugh  ashley whoa  travis dont be jealous  ashley grog its sparkling its sparkling  laura its really creepy grog  ashley hey i /none/ feel it its like sandpaper a little bit  travis thank you thank you  matt keep in mind goliaths predominantly especially pureblood goliaths do not grow facial  hair the fact that this magical feat is even achieving any modicum of growth is in itself an  arcane marvel and who knows what detrimental effects this may have in the long run going  against your physiology  travis oh crap its all right itll make me look really wise you guys nobody will know  marisha i have some beads if you want we can braid it and /none/ put beads in there  laura ooh  travis im all about it beads and bells and shit  marisha okay  marisha i braid grogs beard  travis give me a staff and ill be gandalf  matt all right  marisha and put beads in it and a few flowers as well  travis wait ooh weird  marisha it looks nice  travis all right  matt it takes you a lot of concentration to try and get any sort of braidage through the about an  inch to inch and a half facial hair that is /none/ growing from his chin  marisha looks good  travis its really tight when you braid it like that it pinches  marisha youll get used to it  laura maybe you can cast grasping vine on his chin and grow it out  matt what could possibly go wrong  laughter  travis do it could be great  orion i suggest against this  travis i thought you suggest violence  orion no  sam he encourages violence  laura i encourage violence  orion im against this  ashley is it just violence  laura so were /none/ healed were healed right  sam oh days have gone by right  matt yeah you guys have rested days have gone by your spells have returned to you  liam hey dm days have gone by  laura trinkets feeling good  matt days have gone by at this time youve continued traveling over the ozmit sea  orion are we nearing the destination  matt ill get to that in just a second do you have a question liam  liam no not a question but last night while grog was sleeping i can see right up grogs /none/  nose while grog was sleeping i went and got a bit of rope from the ship and used my disguise kit  that i have i sort of frayed a part of the rope and spent about an hour using spirit gum to glue  bits of frayed rope to grogs chin into a small gilmoreesque goatee and he didnt seem to wake  up and id like to see how that worked out  matt laughs all righty  travis im gonna do a sleep check or something right i cant let him survive that  matt for /dung/ this go ahead and make a perception check with disadvantage  travis with disadvantage  sam because youre asleep  travis one  laughter  orion get it out now  matt you wake up the following morning and immediately run to the nearest reflective surface  to check on yourself and you have a glorious dark brown wellbraided mildly frayed thick  coarse goatee braid it goes about a good three to four inches from the bottom of your chin and you  are very proud  travis i knew it i knew it i am a special boy /none/ laughs  laughter  travis only this one strand is this color and everything else is white and translucent  whatever  orion i think it looks good on you grog  travis thank you  i wave my head and it whips around  ashley sings i whip my beard back and forth  travis sings i whip my beard back and forth  matt it stays taut on your chin all right so as you reach the middle of the sixth day of travel  the sky which up to this point had been fairly sunny and clear /none/ begins to slowly cloud over the  weather grows more gray and the clouds themselves seem to cluster more into i wouldnt say a  stormfront but definitely a more gloomy atmosphere  marisha can i do a nature check to see if this seems to be natural or arcane  matt certainly  orion nice  laura sings with her big fancy die  marisha okay thats a 10 plus 20 total  matt all right looking at these clouds it is a slow formation and they arent moving at an  unnecessary speed or seem to have any /none/ ominous press towards you it just seems like the weather  itself towards this northern continent seems to be of a colder variety  orion im going to sense the weather i suppose because this doesnt look fun  matt okay the weather is cold  orion ooh its cold  travis so the weather outside is frightful  laura good call tiberius good call i agree it is rather cold  orion i dont like this scanlan  sam oi  orion like we were discussing earlier would you be interested in the stillstanding trade of my  ioun /none/ stone for your circletcrown thingy  sam oh you know what tiberius i have been giving this a lot of thought and consideration  whats for lunch  orion what would you like for lunch i already ate  sam oh no no i was done with the conversation  travis oh good diss  laura and ashley oh  orion well keyleth if you could put a little slate up for me id like to illustrate something  for little scanlan and perhaps his tiny mind can comprehend it clears throat  laura ooh  ashley hey thats rude /none/  orion would you perhaps do this  laura his tiny mind is exactly proportionate for the rest of his body tiberius  sam well not the entire body  orion im going to walk up to the hull and be like  marisha no write it right here i throw up a slate  orion oh clears throat  matt okay its the strangest wall youve constructed as up in the air on the ship that is  mostly constructed out of iron and metal there is little to no stone available of which you can  sprout a /none/ wall of stone however there are weights set up on top so what you create is less of a  smooth wall of stone and more of a very thin brittle shale wall that may function for the time  being but probably wont stand up for more than five to ten minutes  orion i see prestidigitation some chalk  matt all right  orion you see scanlan youve had this particular piece for over ten lets say matches  or weeks you have used it zero times in over six battles over the same course  using it /none/ zero times  laughter  orion i being a sorcerer have a special ability called sorcerer points where i can do multiple  spells in a single round  sam yes  orion which none of you can do other than monks of course  laura thats true brag about it tiberius just keep bragging about it  orion when i can do multiple spells like two versus you who can do one that means that i can  do one more spell than you can per round  laughter  sam all right  orion and every round after /none/ that one hundred percent  laughter  sam this is amazing  orion your utilization of the actual item has been equivalent to nothing in the interest of the  group and the use of items in general it would be wise to switch it because you have needed extra  spells like invisibility  matt the shale wall cracks  laughter  orion several times  marisha im sorry  orion where my item would be more useful in general to you  liam may i ask is magical ability inversely proportionate to wisdom  orion oh me  /none/ sam who are you asking  ashley is magical ability inversely proportionate to wisdom  orion absolutely not i am one of the strongest casters in all of draconia and it only takes the  strength of my charisma to do my stuff  laura oh everything makes sense now tiberius  travis so are you saying you want what he has back  sam laughs i didnt recognize you grog is that you  travis it is i brad pitt from legends of the fall  laughter  travis my beard of glory  orion that is a movie /none/  travis its an old bards tale  orion so scanlan what say you  sam your mathematical skills have been quite impressive  orion i dont like to show them off  sam no no for a man of such low wisdom you are proving wiser than i ever imagined  laughter  sam i will gladly make this trade with you you have convinced me  laura hey  marisha aww  orion oh wonderful thank you  sam yes yes  ashley hey  laura thats wonderful  sam all right hugs hugs hugs  laughter  /none/ orion explosion sound  sam now what does this thing do  orion now you can store up to three level spells three of them in there  laura oh its better than the pearl of power  orion and you dont have to expend spell slots to do the spells  sam all right thank you very much  ashley hey  laura thats a good trade  travis oh my god that was so good  ashley that was amazing  orion you can put three lightning bolts in there and it costs nothing  ashley oh math /none/  sam all right all right im man enough to admit that hes convinced me  travis that was so good  ashley that was awesome  travis i dont know what you wrote but it looked good  marisha oh man  orion im sorry  matt the ioun stone which you had taken you place by your head and release it seems to fix  itself in the air and slowly rotate above your head  orion it orbits  matt almost held in its own orbital gravity around your head  laura ooh  sam pike  /none/ ashley oh laughs oh wow its like you have a halo  orion it is fancy  sam its like a halo like your god has smiled on me maybe and said hes cool go for it  ashley oh wow well i dont know if thats what it means  sam well you know religion is up to interpretation so i interpret it that way  ashley it is very coollooking  sam thank you pike  travis laughs so casual her god its cool go for it  matt laughs sarenrae the shebro you never had  laughter /none/  sam sarenraes my wingman  ashley we cool sarenrae  travis i cant breathe  matt many a cart hold that bumper sticker all right so as this conversation comes to a close  the temperature in the sky has gotten noticeably chillier and you swear for an instant you start  seeing what looks like specks of white snow beginning to drift from the clouds ahead  marisha gasps its snowing  laura its snow keyleth  sam sings im dreaming of a white whateverwecelebrate  travis festivus  orion festivus  marisha there was something i should /town/ probably tell you in this area of land in vasselheim on  this continent somewhere im not sure where resides the fire ashari somewhere in  the town of pyrah  laura whats that  ashley ooh  laura what are fire ashari  marisha well theyre my sister tribe theyre a part of my sister tribe i come  from the air ashari  laura right  travis uhhuh  marisha yeah from zephra  ashley whispers fire ashari  laura so they oh  marisha yeah so there are fire ashari so the point behind the ashari im /none/ not sure i have  expressed this to you all in the past few months the point of our tribe is we sought out the  weakest points where the elemental planes start to bleed with our plane of existence and these  planes need to be protected so our people have sought them all out in order to make haven there  and be the protectors that we were all born to be and as part of my aramente i have to seek out  each of the headmasters and prove myself a worthy leader  travis ooh  /none/ marisha which makes me really nervous  laura weve got your back keyleth  ashley oh youll do it youll totally do it  travis yeah yeah we can burn shit for days  marisha so i just thought you know maybe after we handle the horn maybe we can pop in you know  since were here  laura totally you know if you want to keyleth when we go well all follow your orders and make  it seem like youre an extraordinary leader of us  travis ooh yeah  marisha oh that could be good oh /none/ that sounds fun  orion oh good idea yes of course i will be your mage guard  travis do they make you burn things as a display of your abilities  marisha well they kind of teach me new things  laura ooh  marisha they kind of instill me with their knowledge  laura so the tornado thing you could be like a fire tornado  marisha i could i know  travis shut up  marisha im so excited but yes super nervous because social skills arent my strongest suit  laura weve noticed  travis youre /none/ a natural youre great  laura youre great though  marisha oh you guys  ashley but its very charming  travis we gotta go there its fire everywhere  orion laughs oh  marisha yes yes  liam is everything copacetic between the different tribes  travis oh good question  marisha what what  travis is it copacetic  laura are you guys friendly with each other  liam are they happy  orion the tribes  marisha well yes yeah no were all happy i mean thats kind of the thing where once a  generation someone /town/ sets out and goes on the aramente in order to come back a headmaster and  its kind of like our onceageneration checkin if you will to make sure everythings okay  travis exchange students  marisha unfortunately the last person to go on the aramente didnt come back which happens  sometimes yeah  travis like didnt come back ever  marisha no  laura so like you could die  orion or maybe they got lost to the winds of the road  travis right yeah  marisha it was actually my mother  orion oh goodness  /none/ laura gasps what  travis to which tribe  marisha i we dont know she left when i was a little girl so i dont remember much so i dont  know if shes alive or dead really but  laura keyleth  travis we did not know that  marisha its okay its okay  travis yeah no bigs right  laura yeah  travis just your mother  marisha i mean its i mean well its fine its just its weird i havent seen her so i  dont know  sam awkward  marisha i barely remember /none/ her  travis do you think theres a chance of when we visit this place we might have to defend  ourselves  marisha no no i wouldnt think so  orion which means of course  laura its not like your family grog theyre actually nice  marisha yeah were pretty were cool  travis look my family is nice too we just share love with fists  orion understandable  laura that sounds wrong in so many ways  travis it does actually  liam keyleth did your mother have to go alone or does your tribe permit /none/ there to  be help for you  marisha im assuming it would be okay were pretty welcoming  laura thats good  travis yeah we should totally be there  laura all right we will go  marisha yeah  travis and maybe ask them if theyve seen your mom  marisha yeah thatd be interesting  laura yeah  marisha its weird theres this part of me in the back of my head that kind of always wonders if  im going to run into her  travis how old when was the last time you saw your /none/ mother or do you even remember  marisha i was five six maybe years old when she left  travis wow  marisha so im the next in line  laura whispers wow  sam this is heavy  travis yeah  ashley this is very heavy  marisha im sorry i didnt mean to bring the mood down  sam no its fine its good to know this  marisha im just letting you know that were going to be in that neck of the woods  so i should probably  laura stop by  ashley yes  /dung/ marisha  you know go  travis absolutely  laura give a little hello  matt land sighted a voice breaks out from  the side of the ships bow  orion ooh  matt you guys glance over quickly to the edge of the skyship and you see right over the edge of  deera what looks to be this ominous continent slowly approaching through the mists the low  clouds of this area you can make out what looks to be a fairly heavily wooded and overgrown  landscape you can see dark forest peppered with a little /none/ bit of snowfall across the top  laura my kind of place  matt occasional mountaintops and peaks breaking through the canopy of the distant forest  laura look trinket home  matt trinket looms up to the side and looks a bit chilly and shakes it off at which point kima  comes up and joins the rest of you puts her elbows over and looks off wistfully for a second  and goes sighs its been some time welcome to othanzia folks its an interesting place  travis it is isnt it  laura well follow your lead /none/  matt she points off says this forest here we refer to as the vesper timberland and it goes for  miles and miles and miles before bleeding into endless tundra to the north so lets hopefully  not travel that far sighs thisll be interesting and she turns around and heads back  down into the ship as you continue  laura good talk  marisha why did she say that laughs i know  orion who was that person  marisha that was so weird right  orion everywhere we go its everywhere we go why cant people /town/ be normal  travis shes warming up to me i can feel it  matt as the ship slowly begins to descend you can see in the distance from one of the various  mountain ranges that break past the top there is one singular mountain spire that tends to protrude  from the center of the forest about 20 to 30 miles off the shoreline of the ozmit sea around  the base of this mountain you can see the closer you get to it what looks like hundreds upon  hundreds of stone buildings you can see little /none/ details along the mountainside countless  staircases are spiraling up this mountain in different directions in a chaotic fashion there  are large structures fortresses built into the side of this mountain spire as you progress up the  top and this city proper which spreads out id say about a third larger than emon layers of  walls and walls and walls this is probably the mostfortified city youve seen in  your existence up to this point slowly it begins to bring itself down towards and you can see as  you get closer to the city the /none/ walls vary in color and material some look recently built some  look like theyd been constructed in the past 50 to 60 years or so from fine smooth stone using  modern architectural techniques some walls look extremely ancient partially crumbled and having  to be refortified you also notice the top of these walls are completely covered with what looks  like these strange dragonheaded ballistae these defense ballistae that are along every single row  of walls this is a city that is meant to withstand  marisha a siege  matt  any sort of a /town/ siege or onslaught  laura does it look like its suffered a lot of sieges i mean is there battle damage to the  matt its hard to tell from this distance youre just starting to pick up details as the ship  slowly descends into the city of vasselheim proper but from what you can tell there are  scars across some of the larger buildings some of the walls look like they have sections that have  been knocked down and then rebuilt and then knocked down and then rebuilt this is a very  very old old /none/ city slowly the ship descends towards what looks like a smoothedout flattened  platform on top of some mill of some kind it doesnt look like its built for skyship purposes  more than its been haphazardly put together to receive a skyship should it come to the city but  it looks like that type of travel doesnt come to this area too often at this point in time you  can see now the crew is gathering their ropes theyre getting ready to go ahead and lower it  down captain damon is slowly steering and shouting directions /none/ back and forth to his  deckhands the scalebearers and kima come up to the top of the ship carrying the box that  contains the horn of orcus as well as the ship slowly makes its way to dock on the top of this  mill kima who has all of her materials over her shoulder says all right so its everyones  first time here in the city  sam yes  travis yeah  sam yeah well keyleth  orion ive never been here  marisha no  sam okay yes  matt all right  orion /none/ and theres enough in the interim for a short rest from us getting from there to the last  day to where were at  matt yeah yeah  travis a days rest all right  orion okay cool awesome  matt yeah  travis tiberius you ever been here  orion no  laughter  laura is it cold in the city  matt its pretty chilly as you come down i mean you wear furs naturally in cold environments but  this is the temperatures to the point where you may have to consider getting a little bit /none/ of  warmer clothing if you travel too far outside of the city  travis how do goliaths do not wearing much  laura i have a lot of winter cloaks already in my  sam we have some fancy cloaks too dont we  laura well those are fancy clothes  sam oh  laura but ive got winter coats that i bought for the group a long time ago  sam all right pass them out  laura all right  matt so she pulls out the really nice thick  marisha oh thats right we went shopping /none/  laura remember  marisha i remember  ashley oh we went shopping  travis we have three other fancy robes  ashley we had a girl shop day  marisha yep  sam a fancy i want a fancy robe  travis you do its huge on you you want it anyway  orion id have to take off my cloak though to wear that right  matt yeah  orion i wont wear one i keep my cloak on  travis i give you a colorful one  sam ill gird it  matt well say you could /none/ probably put it over it will just look a little chunky  orion okay  sam im going to take a large fancy robe and try to tie it up to gird it so that it looks okay  laura he wants a fancy robe not a fur  travis be aware we only have two left  sam im going to gird my loins  matt and you gird them well you look like the tiniest turkish wrestler youve ever seen  laura oh  laughter  matt its kind of adorable  sam also im going to cast /none/ lightning bolt into the ioun stone  orion yay  matt okay so mark that down you have a thirdlevel lightning bolt saved you still used  the spell slot but after you rest itll be safe inside there which is an interesting experience  you see him do this arcane finger wiggle in the air and then he releases what is a burst of  electrical energy that immediately funnels itself and vanishes into the stone which is now humming  with this low pulsing glow of greenishblue light  sam whispers pike are you watching this  ashley /none/ wow and youre  laura its green its a green wait is it like a diamond shape  sam i dont know  laura its like a sim  marisha oh its like a sims thing  orion its like a little  laura as long as its green youre happy scanlan  orion but i believe its white right its a white stone  matt it is a white stone but the energy glowing off it is greenish in color  orion ah there you go  marisha hes happy  ashley and youre so wellgirded  sam im /none/ girded and ive got a shiny head  matt eventually the ship comes to a stop you feel a little bit of a lurching sensation as the  ship suddenly halts its advancing all the ropes get dropped off the sides they start bringing  what looks to be some sort of a haphazard crane also in preparation for trinket to be lowered off  the ship you can see theres a look of i cant describe it better than anxiousness to kima she  says if you have any questions about the city just speak up and ill do /none/ my best  laura where do we take the horn  sam laughs thats a good question  laughter  matt i believe and she looks over the edge of the ship i believe our escorts will be happy to  guide us  laura our escorts  liam id like to do an insight check before we hustle off  matt on  travis kima  liam kima  matt go for it  orion i would like to look for any places oh sorry  liam i rolled an 18  matt okay and what are you trying /none/ to glean off of her  liam why does she seem anxious does she seem different does her demeanor seem different or  does she just seem in a hurry  matt you can probably take it as a little bit of being in a hurry but you also get the feeling  like theres a nervousness to her that stems its hard to really tell where it comes from but  there is a nervousness to her  laura kima when was the last time you were with your order  matt proper that would be eight years  /none/ laura oh  orion thats a long time to be out of order  matt of which we are about to meet them  orion sorry  sam high five  laura do you get along well with them  matt yes yes theyre just well laughs youll see and she leaps over the side of the  ship grabbing the rope and lowers herself down as do the rest of the the two scalebearers come  down in tandem clutching the chain on the sides of the box bringing it down almost like a big  jacobs ladder  /none/ travis quietly i love you  matt eventually you all make your way onto the platform and theyre waiting for you you see  theres a cluster of wellarmored men and women wearing semimatching gray tabards over patchwork  and plated armor they look like a really roughandtumble militia but they all stand firm  and as you guys walk up they give a nod of respect and understanding amongst them you see  one gentleman an elderly gentleman with no hair completely bald thick spectacles on the tip of  his nose wearing the same silver and blue robes /none/ as the envoys that met you at the council of  taldorei the ones that are carrying the box as you all approach kima steps out ahead and says  yonn its been a while  sam yonn  matt the old man steps forward it has been indeed kima it has indeed and thats  scalebearer yonn if you dont mind  travis scalebearer  matt i would prefer in mixed company the proper niceties of our presentation  laura oh were no proper company its all right  matt hm and you are  sam we are  /none/ orion im tiberius stormwind and we are vox machina everybody has names too  laura hmm  ashley im pike  marisha keyleth  sam im ioun stonebearer scanlan  laughter  matt he cocks his head curiously  sam you can call me kingslayer  i also did that  matt very well percy introduces himself as well  travis i have a beard  laughter  matt he gives you the most curious look of all which is hard to follow off of scanlan over here  and im to understand these are the bearers of the artifact /none/ kima gives a nod yes and i think  we should be on our way quickly yes yes of course please these are our escorts follow  suit we will bring you onward to the platinum sanctuary proper to dispose of this thing  sam how far is the platinum sanctuary  matt no more than a 25minute walk  laura and sam oh  ashley may i insightcheck yonn  matt you may  liam yes please  marisha oh so  orion im going to look for any temples that might have a sigil inside while were going /town/  through the town  matt all right do you want to ask around about that  orion ill ask the yonn guy  matt okay well first off you finish your insight check what did you roll  ashley what did you get liam  liam 13  ashley okay i got 15  matt okay he seems stuffy he seems definitely dedicated to whatever his intent is but there  doesnt seem to be anything deceptive in his speech  marisha so am i correct to assume our plan is that were going to march this horn through /town/ the  town until we get to the temple  laura well nobody knows what it is  orion right  sam well unless someone  laura so well just be aware theres a huge envoy  marisha i mean we can only assume yonn  matt yes  marisha how many people in this city are aware of this horn being brought here  matt well up until now other than myself you travelers and the highbearer vord himself no one else  orion hm  marisha highbearer vor his name is vord  matt vord the highbearer of /town/ the platinum dragon  laura what kind of man is he  matt you hear when he mentions vord kima twitches a little bit and you remember kimas  official title is lady kima of vord  laura and orion hm  sam her ex  travis is that her pops her pops  orion vonn yonn  matt scalebearer yonn yes  orion oh scalebearer yonn thats a fun name clears throat as we travel through town if you  could point me to any place that would have a sigil of arcaneness  sam arcaneiosity is what hes /none/ trying to say  matt there are none  orion oh  matt this city arcane magic for the most part is not allowed within consistent practice this is  a divine a holy place  orion ah  matt and the arcane tends to ah how do you say when unwatched corrupt and destroy from the  inside   liam oh shit tiberius  orion no im fine hes talking about other people  travis you dont have any arcane abilities anyway right  orion oh of course i do im a sorcerer  laura no no no /none/ right  sam ixnay  travis wink wink nudge nudge  orion no no i think he sure  matt this here in vasselheim the cradle of faith the dawn city of once all civilization and  current faith once stemmed from there is no way in but by foot it is a pilgrimage a journey for  each to come here and those that stay stay of their own will and divine right and as he refers  to the guards each guard you see now has around their neck a very visibly shown holy symbol of  some /none/ kind of deity most seem to fall  marisha weve basically walked into the crucible  orion its fine  matt  into the realm of arathis avandra melora and a couple with bahamut none of  ashley none of sarenrae  matt none of sarenrae  travis or as liam calls it sarenrae  laura the best one  ashley the best the best one  liam sarenrae  laughter  ashley sarenrae  orion im going to take it you dont see very many dragonborn in these parts  matt no and frankly youre making me a bit /none/ nervous  orion oh  matt however as we ourselves are followers of the platinum dragon we understand that it is  dragonkind at the heart of it the metallics that bring life and civilization and order to this  world  orion yes  matt your color i find offputting  orion its  laura ive always noticed a fine metallic sheen coming from your red scales  orion no im of the chromatic nature im a bit of an anomaly in my family theyre all of the  metallic brand i assure you the stormwind name runs true /none/ and wide throughout draconia but  matt i have heard of the stormwinds yes  orion i cast alter self real quick and i turn myself into i believe gold because thats the  red equivalent of red on the metallic scale  matt okay he gives you a curious look and goes  orion i think that would be better for everyone involved  matt i would be mindful to not do such things so openly in public in the future  orion oh sorry  matt ahem and he kind of adjusts his robe this way please follow /none/ me and scalebearer yonn  leads you  laura you look very nice tiberius  ashley you look really great in gold  orion thank you thank you  marisha so wait hang on hang on hang on  travis what  marisha before we move on were about to leave im assuming  matt youre stepping off the platform onto a staircase that leads off of the top of the mill  marisha should a few of us kind of like flank around and  laura definitely we should all kind of surround the box sure  travis like /none/ rooftops and shit  marisha rooftop shit yeah  laura oh  travis i like it  marisha i can go eagle form and have aerial support  travis i love it  laura i can stick to the rooftops i guess try to follow along  travis overwatch  marisha overwatch whats that yeah  laura ill snick to the rooftops and try to follow along sniper eye  marisha okay  travis yeah you two up top  ashley ill just stay right on the path  travis yep you and me  matt all right  travis /town/ smash hands  matt all right so  orion ill take the six  matt okay as you  liam im gonna stay with it but try to blend in with the crowd  matt all right all right go ahead and make a stealth check  liam yes  travis scanlan  liam 23 for stealth  matt all right ah if you wouldnt mind vex making a stealth check as well  laura oh  travis overwatch  matt just to keep your rooftop activity inconspicuous  laura not disturbing  travis we have a uav  laura /none/ oh well i rolled a one so thats lovely  matt okay  sam are you flying up above  marisha yeah im going eagle  travis dont you have advantage  laura do i have advantage in no  orion and im taking up the rear following behind  matt no not in this terrain unfortunately  ashley but there are forests here  laura but with the forests id be amazing  liam i do applaud your honesty though sister  laura yeah  matt so as you loudly clomp up and begin rooftophopping a few individuals in /town/ the city  kind of take notice and they point up which by the way  laura i wink at them as im climbing up  matt ah the classic vex wink all right so just you guys kind of atmosphere as you step down  the staircase and get to the main city street proper the first thing you notice the roads  themselves are not cobblestone are not brick they are mud they are thick recently sleeted  mud you hear the clomping of horse hooves as carts are pulled through and each one is a sickly  /none/ squelch sound as each footstep makes it through the people of this city are a very hardened and  rugged folk most clothing is swathed in furs and thick leathers armor is patchwork in itself most  of the men grow coarse facial hair and the women themselves their hair is wild and their  appearance very stoic and grizzled the landscape of vasselheim oh thank you kindly delivery of  our chicken  marisha chicken through the magic door  matt the people who live here you gather quickly walking through and kima gives you a bit  of /none/ insight as well live here not because its easy to live not because theres many comforts  its a very harsh living in the city of vasselheim but the city is also currently the  oldest known bastion of civilization in the world as far as its understood most human  civilization and a lot of humans believe preelf and predwarf although the dwarves and elves very  staunchly disagree all stemmed from this city which is believed to be tens of thousands of years  old they have uncovered the single oldest temples to the main deities of good /none/ and neutrality within  this city and as such it is considered the holiest place in the modern world which is why it  has been through many many wars and has seen much warfare and strife and difficulty and those that  live here live here because they feel that they can fight against this and they actually call it  a privilege to exist in this harsh landscape as devotion to their respective deities also  because it is such a holy place this is why the arcane is considered for the most part profane  in public /town/ and very carefully controlled otherwise  travis so we gotta be sneaky with that  laura yeah  matt the buildings look old  travis so ill put my spells in my back pocket for now  matt the buildings range from old to newer stone warped wood from just the weather itself you can  see a lot of the wood has a kind of mossy texture to it just from the general overgrowth that tends  to take the city its not kept for beauty its kept for function theres scars across most of  the buildings where /none/ you can see warfare has bled into the city and there are markings and various  points of ancient damage and certain structures that have not been rebuilt that have just been  left in ruin where they stand because they have not yet found somebody or a purpose to be  restructured its a very different landscape than what youre used to and the walk itself is a very  solemn quiet walk through the city the folks that do take notice just kind of give a nod of  acknowledgement or a gruff grunt as they pass by /none/ there doesnt seem to be a definite interest in  your travel this isnt a special occasion it seems like travelers and strange occurrences are  not that unnatural in this city  marisha okay so its like new york  matt you could say that yeah its a very ancient new york  sam and were carrying a large ark or a box of some sort  matt you are carrying the platinum box that the horn was kept in  sam how big is it  matt its approximately like a foot and a half or two feet /none/ by two feet  ashley oh taliesins here  laura oh  travis taliesins outside  sam and its platinum its just a platinum box  matt yes it is made of like solid platinum and silver with a series of very very intricate  scrolling and engravings on it  marisha is it sticking out like a sore thumb  laura there were some sapphires in there too some blue sapphires i remember  matt yes yes  marisha is it sticking out like a sore thumb  matt best you can tell there are people taking notice of /none/ it but none that like stop and gawk  they just kind of huh keep walking  marisha damn maybe we shouldve thrown a blanket or something over it  matt you could if you want to now  travis can we though  marisha burlap sack or something anybody  matt the guards still flanking you guys surrounding this ensemble as it presses towards  the base of the mountain you make your way towards the edge of the mountain or where the  mountain begins at the bottom of the floor and you can see dozens of staircases /none/ ascending the  outskirts of this giant pointed cragless spire that just sticks up into actually the clouds cut  off the top of it its reminiscent of gatshadow the mountain outside of westruun that you guys  traveled to long ago  travis right  matt but even larger you continue up this staircase and the stonework itself is a little  lopsided and awkward and with each step sometimes you have to kinda catch yourself especially as  the wind begins to pick up the higher up the mountain you go and it takes about 15 to 20 /none/  minutes to ascend this staircase your legs begin to grow a little sore until eventually you reach  the base of what you can only imagine is the platinum sanctuary you see before you built into  the side of the rock of this mountain a grand stone fortress that looks older than time in  itself you can see the elements have weathered to the point where even the solid points and how the  stonework was meant to be an edge has been rounded and smoothed down there are a series of silver  markings across the /none/ outskirts of it which tiberius you recognize as draconic  orion look percy its draconic  taliesin oh so it is  laughter  matt certain words in draconic  marisha percy youve been so quiet here lately  taliesin i dont want to talk about it  matt you see phrases emblazoned on the side of this giant temple that say things like honor  justice various very old base draconic stuff the current language is a more refined version  this is a very very ancient basis of that language  orion see that scanlan that says something /none/ like apollo justice something  sam its phoenix something  orion its maybe the rise of the justice of the phoenix  sam nah i dont know  orion its a lot of things  travis dawn of justice  matt on the top of this fortress you see three constructs that dont match the stone structure  these may have been constructed or built many years later and have been added onto the temple  but three ivory and silver spires towers that ascend from the top of the fortress itself almost  parallel to the very steep mountainside /none/ that this fortress is built into you come to the front  doors of this structure two very very large gray stone doors with almost what looks like white  marbling through them and you can see mostly worn away but still barely visible the symbol of  a shield with a dragon head emblazoned on the front of it the symbol of bahamut as the  scalebearer yes that there as the scalebearers approach the front the doors on  their own and open to the interior the grinding sound of stone across the marble flooring of the  /none/ fortress proper you can see the interior did you have a question  marisha can i see inside the temple or are the temples pretty enclosed  matt you can see now as the doors begin to open  marisha well i was an eagle flying overhead  matt oh yes you  marisha and i was gonna do a perception check to see if i noticed like kinda do a loop  of the temple  matt go for it  sam so im an eagle  marisha so im an eagle right now so  taliesin youre such /none/ an eagle oh my god  laura i very very poorly fall off of the roof and clamber down  marisha 20 total  matt best you can tell there are for the makeshift guards in the city which youve heard  them referred to as bastions theyre all volunteers and actually from what you gather  here probably a quarter of the populace are bastions so they have a very very heavy  civilianbased militia that guards this city  sam are those the guys who were with us the  envoys  matt yes no no not the /none/ envoys the envoys come from the temple of bahamut they have  the blue and silver robes you see theyre just wearing makeshift patchwork armor whatever that  could be scavenged or constructed to outfit a militia essentially  sam okay  matt you see them going up and down every which staircase just doing various passes and  patrolwork some of them have spyglasses and you see them looking off in the distance and as  youre getting higher up the mountain too you look out about and you can see the entire forest  around you very thick /town/ ominous and you swear every now and then you can see some trees move  suddenly and heavily before coming to rest in the distance  marisha im gonna go check that out first  matt the rest of you are entering the temple keyleth is not there  orion is it lit in there  matt the doors close behind you  sam hope keyleth is okay  laura keyleth  marisha eagle noises  liam i dont think that i was with the group i think i was back with the crowd  laura no you  sam /none/ great  liam  so i see the eagle fly off and im just gonna follow after her  laura what  matt the eagle flies out of the city  liam yeah  laura youre gonna leave the city brother  liam no  orion youre leaving  marisha gonna see if i can figure out whats making the trees move  liam now that i understand the  laura come on in the temple  liam but do i still get shut in my face so  marisha im flying im fine  liam its a big solid /none/ building doors are shut thats it  matt yeah i mean the temple would you like to enter the temple with the rest of the group  laura yeah you would  ashley yeah do it  matt all right  liam yeah  matt so just as the doors are closing you rush out of your subtle following pattern and wait  and put your hands up and manage to make your way into the temple right before the doors close  catching up with the rest of the group keyleth make a perception check  marisha i have /none/ advantage because im an eagle ooh natural 20  sam and travis nice  taliesin on the shiny die  matt all right  orion it is on the shiny die  matt its hard to see much of anything because the canopy of this forest is so dense and so  thick and the snowfall itself which is getting stronger through the air and is kind of obscuring  some of your vision but you glance down and you see another set of trees shift suddenly about a  quartermile away from the citys walls and you can see /none/ on the edge of the city wall a number of  guards are beginning to swarm up to the ballista and starting to load them and prepare them you  glance down and all you see are something fastmoving beneath the canopy something large  something you can swear you see it looks serpentinelike but multiple serpentinelike  bodies or forms and then its gone in a second  laura hydra you think its a hydra  orion i dont want it to be a hydra  liam stop gasping i dont see shit laura  orion oh thats right /none/  laura shut up  matt you see a couple ballista set loose the bolts go flying through the air entering the  forest you can hear a loud screeching sound and a few dozen forests now begin to shake to the side  as the creature makes its way away from the city before going still in the distance  marisha okay  matt you get the sensation that this is a  marisha a common occurrence  matt  a common occurrence  marisha okay good to know im going to loop back around is there like an /none/ open window in the  temple that i can just fly through  orion ooh is there a super clear one that she could try to go through first  marisha be like that windex commercial back in the day  matt the temple  orion crashing sounds dammit  matt you make your way  marisha i break my neck i die  orion no  matt there are small they are not windows more than they are slits for arrow defense  travis right  matt you as keyleth could squeeze through it would be one of those /none/ things where you have to  careen in transform and then squeeze through  marisha okay ill do that  matt which you do and as you do you come right into the face of a spear right there  laura gasps you should have transformed into a fly  matt  as another one of the platinum dragon guards says who goes there  sam oh boy  marisha hi hi  matt another guard begins to approach from the side  marisha i am with vox machina im pretty sure they just came through the front door its /none/ cool  i was just doing just like aerial support im just going to go and reconnect with my group  its fine  matt make a persuasion check  marisha im keyleth  travis whispers mention the scalebearer  marisha im not good at this shit  matt youre not there grog  marisha what am i doing a persuasion check  matt yeah  marisha christ  orion youre going to roll a one  matt sorry miss charisma  marisha shut up  taliesin oh wow  marisha oh wait i dont know why im rolling two /none/  taliesin thats real funny  marisha six  laura oh no  sam keyleths dead  orion whispers no theyll probably just put her in prison  matt the guy holding the spear to you keeps it there the other guy walks up behind and says  let me see your hands  laura gasps  liam shit  marisha why  matt let me see your hands he takes your hands pulls out a set of shackles  laura gasps  ashley oh no  matt  and locks them on  laura this is the second time /none/ youve been arrested  marisha yeah it is  matt the guy with spear turns behind you and just holds it to your back as the gentleman who just  cuffed you grabs the chain between and starts pulling you towards the main chamber  marisha you know can we just buzz by the front foyer and then well find my friends and then  well all be like hey those are my itll be fine  orion i think thats where youre going  matt he leads you down the stairway to an area where it opens up into /none/ a small courtyard takes  you to the right of the courtyard into a central chamber where the rest of vox machina is  currently being led  laura keyleth  orion do i see her  matt yeah you guys all see her being led in in cuffs essentially  orion seriously again  travis what did you do  laura again keyleth  orion your highness what is your problem  ashley oh shes with us shes with us she was just outside we got in before  travis no we dont know who she is  taliesin /none/ actually can we have a few minutes to discuss this  marisha shut up grog  matt at this point kima turns and says shes with me  laura oh  matt and both the scalebearers go lady kima i am so sorry and they go ahead and take the cuffs  off real fast and pull the spear back and step back  ashley wow  laura yeah you listen to lady kima  orion the classic  marisha the classic  orion the classic handcuff wrist twist  marisha ouch  liam hardass  laughter  marisha yeah /none/ im with her  matt they back off and bow deeply and escort themselves off embarrassed  marisha did you guys see that  ashley that was cool  orion i nudge grog  travis that was cool you were arrested  orion grog grog im nudging you  travis you hadnt done anything  taliesin i knew you had it in you  marisha im starting to feel so hardcore  orion im just nudging you  travis oh okay  orion because kima did something super hot  taliesin you need a tattoo  marisha i do need /none/ a tattoo  travis i know i noticed she doesnt love me though  laura she does grog  travis no not yet  matt all right scalebearer yonn continues to lead you through this main chamber and this  chamber like i said its the temple its strange because most temples youve seen to  bahamut or many other deities are extravagant or are you know built with a modernday sense of  architecture this is a very plain simple stone fortress its hard to grasp what time it was  built but just the smell itself seems very /none/ ancient theres a scent of dust and age and  functionality to its construct but theres still a sense of power to it especially you pike  where youre sensitive to divine energy this whole place is humming with it even though its  not the kind youre used to connecting with this is when they say this is a holy place you can  feel it  laura is everything okay pike  ashley its just theres a lot of holiness here  laughter  orion i would imagine  marisha oh  sam on a scale from one /none/ to five five being super holy  ashley probably six  sam whoa  laura whoa  marisha gasps  orion thats extra holy  marisha this temple goes to six  ashley this temple i mean this  orion laughs this temple goes to six  ashley just this whole land in particular i mean theres a lot theres a lot here but  orion that is good though  ashley yes good  sam do you need a moment do you need to sit down do you need me to hold you  ashley i think im okay /none/ to keep going  laura all right  ashley but maybe later well see if i get a little tired  matt at which you feel a nudge at your side and its an armored elbow from kima saying if you  wouldnt mind holding off on the fraternizing in the temple of bahamut i would really appreciate it  marisha oh thats right  sam message understood  matt at which point scalebearer yonn is now at the second set of double doors and he presents his  holy symbol above his chest it glows a second and what /none/ was originally just smooth stone doors you  see a divine glow and the symbol of bahamut you saw at the front of the temple appear for a  moment and then as it vanishes the two doors open on their own into a central worship chamber this  is a much larger domed room it looks like it goes up about 80 feet to the top of the ceiling and  the dome itself has what looks like an extremely ancient detailed drawing like sistine  chapelstyle the tale of the entirety of creation you see all the elemental /none/ planes  represented in the corners the theoretical corners where corners would be in a domed room  you can see a crude representation of how all the planes lay over each other you can see the astral  plane you can see where the nine hells would exist and the abyss itself and in the center  theres the prime material plane and across it you see a giant image of the great platinum dragon  bahamut drawn in all of his glory currently snapping down on one of the throats of a  multiheaded dragon this other dragon /none/ with five different heads of five different chromatic  colors and this struggle between what you know to be bahamut and tiamat  travis tiamat  matt tiamat  laura is that the bad one  matt you gather  liam that is the baddest one  laura i mean i know that because i know a lot about dragons  matt indeed  marisha whoa do i see or learn anything about the elemental planes that i didnt know before  matt not from the artwork its very pretty  marisha ah so pretty  orion i take it /dung/ all in and im reminded of one of the museums at home  matt and actually youve seen this art piece in a book its been a long time but you know that  this has been studied before and exists somewhere in draconia the tome that talks about this exact  temple  travis a book  marisha we just made cave drawings i dont  sam thats those square things  orion the square things with all the paper leaves in them and squiggles  travis right  laura is tiamat still alive is he still around  /none/ orion i read a lot of those cant put my finger on it  matt at which point both yonn and kima and the scalebearers kind of turn to you with a look of  kind of understanding that you dont quite know but also the fear and the knowledge that they  dont say anything they just give you a look that says yes very much so  laura oh i mean nervous laugh tiamats still around huh  orion unfortunately yes  matt they continue walking  laura oh  matt now the floor of this chamber which /none/ is a very simple stone you can see there are small  sculptures each one representing some sort of a humanoid entity dressed in similar robes to the  other envoys and members of this temple that youve encountered thus far some of them are in  full armor some are wearing just robes and theyre very very old some of them seem a little  more recent and you gather these each have some sort of cultural or religious significance to this  temple however one of these is not a statue in the center of this worship chamber /none/ which is  strangely eerily quiet there is one humanoid that turns to the rest of you what you see before  you is a slender elven male draped in long white robes that drag a few feet behind his form across  the ground he has jet not jet starkwhite hair that is slicked back against his head no facial  hair frail but very handsome features elves when they age they age very gracefully  laura yeah we do  marisha yeah  matt  and from the look of most elves youve seen this is a very /dung/ old elf that has aged very  gracefully he turns to the rest of you and you see across his neck a very very wellcrafted  intricate series of draconic symbols that finishes with a giant emblem of bahamut himself his voice  rings out and echoes throughout the hallway as you approach each footstep echoing as you get closer  welcome everyone to the platinum sanctuary i am called highbearer vord  laura oh right  matt keeper of this most holy of places i received word from a disciple of mine at which  kima has now stepped /none/ forward and bows kneels before him and says your holiness at which he  looks down with a smile ah kima i am pleased to see you it has been a long time my disciple  he looks up to the rest of the group i understand you carry something of terrible omen  let us discuss how to be rid of it please present the container  laura right here  matt the scalebearers step forward and set the container on the ground they go to reach for it  and he goes no no no do not open /none/ it and he kind of takes a second and holds his symbol to his  chest and closes his eyes and you can see this kind of divine glow pulse off  of him for a second  marisha kima whats happening  matt she goes shh shh  marisha okay  matt the box begins to pulse with the divine light as well and then suddenly vanishes and he  kind of gasps catches his breath it is as you said this must be sealed immediately  orion well yes  marisha yeahhuh we could have just told you /none/ that  matt he gives a look to the rest of the group here and you can see theres a noticeable bead of  sweat he kind of wipes off his forehead i just needed to confirm that this was not some  haphazardly constructed fake or some other artifact mistaken for such a horn but we indeed  have within our presence one of the horns of orcus and this does not bode well  laura whistles  matt thankfully  laura are you guys oh sorry  matt no please what do you want to say  laura /none/ i was just wondering youve had one of these before yes  matt no but we know that these exist a few of us do the knowledge itself has been lost to time  intentionally it was brought to my attention and through discussions with the council that sent you  on this journey that this would be the safest place to seal such an artifact and amongst all  our other options as of this time i see no other choice so whats been proposed allow me to  explain to you the plan one of our most divine /none/ relics of our most beloved protector bahamut was  kept deep beneath this temple within the mountain we rest against the star of exaltation a crystal  born from the tear bahamut shed for the sacrifices his first devoted made in the great war of the  beginnings the dawn war this item was unfortunately lost nearly 300 years ago giving  the last of its power to protect this very vasselheim the intervention it brought from our  great deity expended and left the artifact destroyed since the chamber that held this star  a blessed and everwatched nexus /none/ beneath the gaze of the great platinum dragon himself has gone  empty weve tended to it weve kept it fairly wellwatched and in the state it was originally  constructed for and we think no greater location to seal such a deeplyrooted evil exists within  our spheres of influence or any other unfortunately the last time the chamber was  cleansed and prepared was some 15 years ago our curate tasked one of our own scalebearers  and he looks over towards yonn who sheepishly backs away  was tasked with preparing it for  your arrival and /none/ the artifacts and it was found that the lower chambers have been infested with  some manner of foul subterranean spider creature  marisha oh man  matt our scalebearer fled at which point yonn leaves the entire conversation and exits the room  ashley quietly excuse me  sam yonn  matt you hear kima kind of give a spit in his direction  matt but not before initiating the vaults defenses  sighs so thus i ask you to complete your journey into the hall of the exalt below clear  out these meager beasts and guide your /none/ reliquary into the vault chamber to seal it for good  orion will we have to contend with the defense systems as well  matt not all of them but apparently in his haste to escape and defend himself he set a few  of them to aid his escape  laura great shouts good job yonn  marisha thanks yonn  matt you hear no response other than the pitterpatter of steps  sam why does he still work here  travis laughs right  orion laughs very good question  taliesin would you like to speak to his /none/ manager  sam does he have tenure or something is it a union thing  matt hes been with us for many many years and he has great heart and devotion though addled may  be his mind he does bring much to the temple  marisha he has seniority  sam all right  marisha so wait you said you lost the crystal of exaltation during the war of  matt it was destroyed during a siege of the city  marisha during the war of what beginnings  matt the war of the beginnings  marisha the war /none/ of the beginnings  taliesin that was close  marisha and how long ago was this war of the beginnings  matt well that oh im sorry it was created in the war of the beginnings  marisha it was created then  matt it was lost in a battle a siege of the city of vasselheim 300 years ago  laura 300 years  marisha called what during what war  taliesin the siege of the metal champions  matt that had no particular name  marisha oh  laura oh  marisha just a siege  laura it /none/ was just a thing  matt it was one of the sieges and there was  sam the battle where the thing was lost  matt yes there it is  orion right  laughter  liam vord hi question please well clear out your basement thats not a problem id like to  understand how you plan to protect this horn how you plan to keep it out of the hands of entities  who would use it for ill  laura that big scary creature living out in the woods sorry brother  liam then how thats fine /none/  matt he glances towards you and says oh that is but one of many  laura huh  matt let it be known that this temple is extremely wellguarded it is continuously under  the gaze of our patron deity and while some of the defenses have been put in place for your arrival  if the entirety of the vault is triggered there is nothing that will make its way there  unannounced  travis good sell  sam are we to carry the box down as we journey into the dungeons below or are we to leave /none/ it  here while we go clear out the basement  matt the scalebearers will bring it with you  sam okay  matt keep them safe  sam keep them safe oh all right weve got enough to worry about keeping ourselves safe  marisha so just to get one thing clear and i mean no clears throat disrespect but how was  the crystal lost 300 years ago if it was in this chamber so this chamber has been  broken into before  matt we can enter the chamber under very specific circumstances we at the time /none/ requested  the use of the star of exaltation as a divine focus  marisha oh  matt  a ritual that required the intervention of bahamut to keep the city safe  marisha oh so someone brought it out and then was clumsy and lost it  laura and then it was lost  sam and you know what  matt it wasnt clumsy and lost it was used as a focus in the ritual  marisha oh  matt it was by the will of bahamut himself that the star no longer was required to exist on this /none/ plane  orion she gets it she gets it  matt it served its purpose  marisha so it was destroyed  laura lost as in  orion like not around  marisha you should change your verbage here  taliesin charisma of ten ladies and gentlemen charisma of ten  laura while everybodys been talking can i have used my primeval awareness to see within six miles  if theres any dragons around us  sam sings primeval awareness yeah  matt so you take a moment and kind of zone out for a second you do not sense /none/ any dragons in the  immediate vicinity of the sixmile radius of the city no  laura oh okay all right thats all i wanted to know  sam sings primeval awareness over  travis can we drop off

matt you want a monetary reward  laura i was just wondering  matt  for your aid  laura im not asking  matt the temple can provide a sum of three thousand gold pieces  laura per party member yes  matt entirely three thousand gold pieces for your trouble on this journey at which kima steps  forward and says highbearer we do not need to take money from  laura we dont want money of course not i mean i  sam but think of the good we could do /none/ with that money giving alms to the poor back home where we are  laura yes spreading the word of bahamut where we go  ashley are we going to return for it  sam we do a lot of charity work and it would be wellreceived back home under his breath in our keep  matt you make a persuasion roll you make a deception roll  sam deception  laura its not a deception we really will  travis no no only one of you  matt laughs no he wont  taliesin the ladies of the evening /none/ really really do need the money apparently  marisha laughs no he wont  travis what did

marisha you should lie more its good  taliesin lie to me pinocchio lie to me  matt three thousand gold at your disposal to bring about and to share in the prosperity of your  people back home  sam amen  laughter  matt once the artifact is delivered and sealed  sam from one holy man to another i think weve struck a deal lets go  orion burt reynolds youve done it again  travis amen  laughter  matt as you all turn kima goes ill show you to the vault room  /none/ laura are you going to come with us kima  matt yes im coming with you  laura oh good  matt she glances over at you sarcastically shall we holy man  laughter  sam why yes my sister lead the way  marisha sister  laughter  matt as you guys are walking out of the chamber the doors close behind she turns to you and says  is that why you were blessed with such a temporarily swollen appendage before  sam i dont know how the lord works its mysterious  laughter  matt let us /none/ be on our way she kind of walks off flustered and frustrated you guys are led  down two layers this actual temple recedes further and further into the mountain until  youre led into what seems to almost be a storage basement its a very musty smell its old earth  orion its dank down here  matt yeah it kind of has that moldy scent to it there are five guards stationed in this storage  vicinity and as you approach they all stand up theyre all still wearing ceremonial armor two of  which you can see /none/ are really wellarmed one with a greatsword and one with a longsword at the side  they look pretty prestigious to be assigned to a basement this terrible  laura at ease soldiers  matt of course of course  matt and they step aside kima steps forward and takes her holy symbol and removes it from around  her neck she looks at the wall for a second then places it into what you didnt see before was some  sort of a slight recess in the wood it flashes with divine energy and suddenly the wood illusion  /none/ is dispelled and what you see before you is a stone doorway that begins to slowly shift to the  side and open up into a staircase  laura are we going to find any of these defenses right away or what  matt kima kind of gives you a look shrugs and to be perfectly honest i have not been within  the vault  taliesin well  ashley okay  marisha huh is there a blueprint somewhere  travis liam youre up i mean clears throat vax  sam i thought he was vex  liam sorry my /none/ communication earring was a little low there what was said  laura check for some traps brother  liam you got it you got it im glad to get out of upstairs i mutter to my sister because the  decor up there was shit  marisha laughs  liam that is high that was a 26  matt 26 for  laura traps in the stairway  liam just traps  matt perception for traps all right as you slowly begin to descend the stairway you keep an  eye out across the staircase itself and any of the /town/ surrounding walls the stonework here is also  extremely ancient marking probably a similarity to the most ancient of buildings youve seen in  this city this subterranean structure is probably one of the older parts of this temple you dont  see anything trapwise the stairway eventually comes to an end into a chamber about 50 feet by 50  feet its very very low light there appear to be  orion oh light  matt okay the brief moment of light before your eyes can really focus in theres a flash of light  at the end of /none/ tiberiuss staff and the room actually gets harder to see you see there is a  thick white mist that just kind of hangs in the air throughout the entirety of this room  orion oh fssh  marisha its like having your highbeams on when its foggy  orion i decast light  matt okay you dispel the light  orion what is all of this poppycock  matt your eyes adjust a little bit and you can see what looks like this room for the most  part doesnt have any sort of details there are a couple /none/ of sconces with low flickering light  that are embedded in the side of the walls of this 50 foot by 50 foot room its about 20 feet high  marisha i go ahead and i do a little wind gust and i go blows air  matt okay  marisha down the hall to clear out the fog  matt which spell is this  marisha gust of wind  matt okay so you cast gust of wind the mist that was filling this room blows out the other  side and you can see the room is a /dung/ little more visible now  orion oh very good light  matt theres still a light mist on the sides but the center of the walkway is clear for a second  you see now in the center of the room what were initially just dark spots in the mist there are  two pillars that are attached from ceiling to floor roughly about 20 feet apart from each  other kind of in the center of each side of the room each pillar is solid gray stone with what  looks like intricately carved small dragons almost curling and /none/ wrapping around the statues each one  of their heads kind of turned mouth opened kind of angrily in different directions  laura can i check for traps or see if theres anything  travis you should recast that  matt you guys both of you guys make perception checks  laura yeah  liam thats a 19  laura oh he already rolled look at him  liam yeah  laura perception  matt mmhm  laura 25  matt so looking about liam sorry vax you notice the base of each one of these pillars is  not /none/ flush with the floor there is a slight gap meaning there is some sort of a rotation or a  pivot to these pillars  laura hm  matt you notice that these mouths of the dragons seem to be whats creating this white mist and as  time progresses the mist begins to refill up the room rather quickly  laura all right do i notice any does it seem well without touching it any kind of poisonous  in nature anything like that  matt looks like mist  ashley should we run through  orion while were /none/ standing around id like to reassign the earrings to vax grog and scanlan  laura i dont get one anymore youre taking it off of me right now  travis yeah hes giving it to me laughs  orion because were always together were always kind of in the back together and theyre always  kind of like up in the fray so  travis thats true i do wander off easily  sam oh is that you grog  travis laughs hi i know  orion shes always kind of like in the middle shes the wild card hes /none/ always in the back with  us also because were the ranged dudes  laura all right  marisha wait do i still have one  taliesin im putting down my mask just in case this is awful  matt okay you guys are still at the stairway the mist has now filled the room again in front of you  laura ugh should we try breathing it and see what happens  sam yeah sure  marisha my gust of wind  laura i just reach my arm into the mist and just see  marisha my gust of /none/ wind lasts up to one minute by the way so i can keep  laura oh maybe we should just not touch the mist and go straight through the room  marisha im just airbending  matt okay  taliesin youve been wanting to say that  laura so you can blow it and we just walk through  matt as this conversation has continued lets say about 30 or 40 seconds has gone by in  transferring the earrings and the discussion so theres still a little bit of there is a clear  pathway in the center there /none/  marisha not much time  sam lets go  laura should we go  sam lets go through  laura lets go before it gets back  travis yeah  ashley i start running  taliesin yes go run  liam hustle hustle  laura go go go  matt okay you all start running through youre running through with them and keeping  concentration on your spell  orion vax check for traps  sam vorak desona come  laura i perceptionchecked the room it didnt seem like there was anything  orion oh are we good okay /none/  liam im running ten feet ahead of everybody i rolled a big old one  laughter  sam he tripped  matt okay  marisha wow  matt you continue forward and as youre rushing through the group not paying attention you  gently hit the edge of the mist barrier with your shoulder as youre rushing to the side  instinctually to stealth along the wall as your shoulder breaks the mist  liam bring it  matt all of the dragon mouths burst into bright fiery flame and begin spinning rapidly in the  room the people /none/ that are in the center running through right now which include keyleth scanlan  tiberius and pike all of you guys make dexterity saving throws  ashley what  sam whoa  marisha son of a bitch  laura vax  sam way to go vax  taliesin teacher teacher did i have time to finish my book  matt you have  taliesin yes  ashley dexterity check  liam you said dex save dex save  matt dex save yes  orion 18  marisha its all right  matt 18  orion mmhm  matt all right /none/ hmm scanlan  sam oh 13  matt 13  ashley three  matt all right  liam 26  matt all right  marisha also 13  ashley but im short im so short they would  laura super duper short  travis just going to hit you in the face  ashley they would just flow right over me  matt okay as the flames just burst out throughout the room tearing into the air with  this reddishwhite flame both vax and tiberius manage to try and dodge out of the way as best  they can /none/ only receiving each of them  laura well all vax has to do is roll because hes already on the freaking ground  matt 12 points of fire damage to each of you  marisha to who  liam well rogue with uncanny dodge for a successful save gets zero damage  matt you take none  orion and i take half  matt so you take zero damage you take 12  orion so i take half is it 24 total  matt no 24 total you take half  orion oh  marisha the rest of us  /none/ matt scanlan keyleth and pike all take 24 points of fire damage  sam ugh  ashley i got 24 points  marisha ouch  orion oh my robe  sam ow are we still moving  liam tuck and roll  orion are you getting used to your new foot vax  liam im back  matt you guys move through thats the four of you guys percy grog and vex and trinket are all  behind as they watch the flames burst out and they all kind of stop their inertia and now the  mist slowly fills /none/ up the room  travis whoa  matt about the time that your spell wears off for the first minute  marisha okay weak chuckle lets move  travis it fills up the room  laura were still in the room  sam the three of us youre still back  matt you guys are split right now with the bearers the scalebearers  laura oh theyre coming with us theyre like coming with us through the whole thing  matt theyre with you yeah  marisha wait hang on  laura keyleth blow the smoke again blow the mist /none/ away if you can  marisha burning another spell slot all right here we go  matt oh no  ashley we run through it  laura and now we run  marisha oh no he doesnt care  travis he doesnt care  taliesin no we walk gently through  matt burning the second spell slot wind noise the mist clears itself now that youre aware of  what it does youre very careful to direct it towards the center and leave an open path the  rest of you rush through including the scalebearers in the minute you /none/ have the wind is  blowing in your face from keyleths position its kind of like stepping into the force of a  hurricane you have to put your hand in front of you to see  laura shouts your breath smells pretty good though keyleth  marisha thanks i tried to get a little of a sage thing  ashley sagey rosemary  travis very minty  marisha a little orange blossom its nice  orion im going to prestidigitate a tiny air shield in front of me  liam when i bite into a york peppermint patty  /none/ marisha its also pure oxygen so we could get a little buzz  matt its a very very tiny shield it protects this much of your face  orion thats what im doing  matt your eyes are fine the rest of your robes are still windblown cloth sounds  orion yeah  matt you guys all make your way across the room you then finish your spell and the mist  immediately fills up and completely obfuscates that room behind you once more  sam one down  marisha we made it  sam 20 rooms to go  /none/ matt youre now in what is a tenfootwide chamber for an additional a tunnel or hallway  for another 20 feet before it opens up into another room but there is no light source in  there whatsoever you with light on your staff again you kind of step ahead to  laura do you want to shoot an arrow in  orion oh would you like to see  laura yeah lets do it  orion yeah very good light  matt all right so as vex releases her arrow light bursts forth from the wooden shaft as it /none/  arcs across the room as it does you can see the room as compared to the previous one that was  square in shape this one is circular it is almost a cylinder in its design go ahead and make  a perception check  laura 16  matt okay  liam 29  laura hes better  matt okay you notice that across this floor of the circular room there are these circles marked  across the entirety of the surface here  laura great those are probably traps  travis i bet those are fun  laura /none/ pressure plates maybe  orion okay or sigils or maybe we have to activate them or not activate them  travis i have darkvision now with a range of 60 feet  sam can we see to the other side of the room  matt hm  sam can we see all the way to the other side of the room  matt opposite side there is actually a much larger opening and what looks to be another  staircase that descends this one is 20 feet wide its a very wide staircase from what youre used  to seeing /none/ especially in these structures  sam and im hoping theres no door  matt no doorway its open it just descends down below and the only way you can tell is that the  arrow arcs across  liam everybody stand back  im going to click my boots of haste  laura what shouldnt we throw something onto one of the pressure plates first and see what it does  liam yeah me im going to click my boots of haste im going to run im going to do a sort of  a running roll land on the /none/ closest circle and wait for half a tick and then roll off of it  laura are you kidding me  orion what are you doing  travis no no let him do it let him do it  matt so as you guys are about to go wait vax is already off clicks the boots the arcane magic of  the boots of haste kick into his body he leaps forward make an acrobatics check  liam okay 22  travis i hope you get your eyebrows burned off  matt all right you leap forward your hand touches /none/ the first circle in the room as it does  theres suddenly a large shift in the room all of a sudden the hand which you had purchase on  slides out from underneath you you catch yourself on your feet but now suddenly theres a loud  grinding sound and the entire room seems to be shifting moving spinning in its own right and  you instinctually feel something moving towards you very quickly make a dexterity saving throw liam  sam oh boy  laura vax  orion i click my earring youre an idiot vax  liam /none/ im going to use luck because that blew and thats a natural 20  sam and marisha oh  ashley oh snap  orion yeah 20  ashley yeah 20  marisha yeah  matt so you barely manage to move out of the way before that circular portion of the ground  skyrockets up like a pillar one very similar to the one that you created for your spell slams  into the ceiling with a heavy thud retracts and continues again in fact looking around you all  of them in the room are now at different levels /none/ pistoning into the ceiling repeated crashing  rock noises this entire room is slowly rotating and theres just a series of pillars mashing into  the ceiling  marisha oh its like a minigame  matt you have to make an acrobatics check to try and get through this now because you have very  little space to move  liam okay  laughter  liam im going to use luck again  matt laughs  liam that is 18  matt 18 you manage to make your way halfway across the room dodging out of the way as these /none/  pillars are slamming and retracting kind of use the pattern of when theyre pulling down from the  ceiling but theyre moving very fast one of them manages to catch you underneath your ankle go  ahead and make a dexterity saving throw again  liam that is 15  matt 15 all right  travis uhoh  ashley youre going to hurt your foot again vax  matt it catches you takes you off of your balance and it rockets you towards the ceiling  you manage to pull most of your body out of the way in /none/ time but it still catches the back of your  shoulder blade you take 40 points of crushing damage  travis yes cackles  sam ohhh  marisha holy shit  matt as you are slammed into the ceiling and as the pillar retracts you roll off with a heavy  wheeze of pain groan catching onto your feet again make one more acrobatics check  marisha oh my god if you get crushed to death  travis laughs on skype  liam thats a 23  matt what was that  travis 23  matt 23  liam im /none/ like an acrobatic cheetah 23  matt 23 you manage to in the severe pain youre feeling you can tell theres probably some  serious bruising in there and you probably broke a couple of ribs but you manage to just barely  dodge and leap out of the way making your way across the room to where the staircase descends  out of the immediate danger  sam ah  laura jeez  matt the rest of you now are standing on the opposite side of this room which is currently a  rotating grinding mill  travis that /none/ was great  liam id like to check if theres any kind of device or anything on this side  orion okay hold on a second vax just chill out for a minute we all just took a little damage  this last time  liam im just trying a perception check  sam hes checking hes checking  matt all right make a perception check  marisha for a lever or something  travis for a switch  liam 25  sam 25  matt 25 you can see in the ceiling in the very very center of the /none/ room precariously placed  right where one of the pillars in the center slams into the ceiling there appears to be a small  quartersized hole gold piecesized hole in the ceiling  ashley yeah come on vex  taliesin race you for it  matt its in the middle of the room  in the ceiling where  liam is there a clear shot of it or is there bang bang bang going on  matt oh no its still going the pillars are still slamming into the roof and that one hole  you see is right where /none/ one of the pillars slams into the roof you only see it intermittently when  the pillar retracts  marisha go sharpshooters go  taliesin you first or me  laura well lets try this first because you might just break it down completely  taliesin oh very well  laura you are much more powerful than i am percy  travis yeah ladies first perhaps  taliesin ladies first  laura all right can i try to shoot an arrow into the little hole  matt you can this is a hard shot because its at an angle now /none/ were talking this is robin  hoodlevel splitthearrow because you have to hit it and then ricochet upward to see if itll  have any effect  laura oh jeez louise  travis well get up there  marisha i place my hands on her shoulders  travis can you inspire  sam i can inspire her  marisha and i give her enhance ability  sam ooh enhance ability  laura okay what does that mean  marisha you have advantage on oh ability checks its just ability checks  matt ability checks its not going to help for /none/ an attack  laura this is what an attack  marisha never mind  matt this would be an attack  travis i would like to offer my beard for a rub of good luck  laura thanks grog  matt as you offer the beard it tears off  travis what  ashley oh no  travis what did you do  laura you know what im going to tie this to the arrow its going to give it really good luck  sam that seems like its aerodynamically  laura im not actually going to tie it to /none/ the arrow  taliesin okay  laura im just going to tuck it  matt mark in your inventory you now have fake grog rope beard  travis is that a 1 to my confidence now  matt laughs it will come into play  travis cries  orion so the goal is to shoot an arrow into this like the death star  matt essentially yeah  laura yeah  orion okay cool as i see her ready im going to hold up my hand with my ring and point it  right at that hole  matt to /none/ do  laura so you can deflect it if i  orion i got your back  laura all right thanks tiberius  orion get it vex  matt all right and youre going to  sam im going to inspire her with inspiration ill sing sings ooh ooh shut up and shoot that  hole your arrow is my destiny yeah i said  all sings ooh ooh shut up and shoot that hole laughs  matt and with that you feel your focus you wait you breathe in you breathe out you breathe  in you breathe out /none/ in pattern with the slamming of the piston against the ceiling  laura oh im so nervous  ashley get it get it get it youre going to do it  matt you let out all your breath and you hold hold hold waiting between heartbeats and then  twwt release go ahead and make your attack roll  laura im going to roll the fancy one we got last week  liam get it girl get it  laura all right laughs oh no okay i add my attack bonus  matt yes you do  sam plus an /none/ inspiration  laura plus an inspiration dice  matt plus a d10  orion oh shit  marisha whispering its so quiet  orion i know  laura oh thats awesome okay 35  yelling  travis good inspiration  matt as you release the arrow you see the pillars slamming the pillar comes down just as  the arrow crests over it past another pillar that just barely manages to miss it by a segment  orion i cast telekinesis to swoop it up whoosh  sam oh god  orion just to help and guide it  ashley /none/ no but its already gone in  travis we dont need it we dont need it  laura oh let me just see if i got it first  liam she rolled a 35 we dont need shit  orion its going in there anyway i dont even have to roll  matt so as the pillar pulls down the arrow goes cascading forward go ahead and make a d20 roll  with the 5 modifier  orion sweet thats 17  matt 17 okay so as the arrow makes its way it ricochets off the bottom edge of the /none/ actual hole  and immediately bends itself upward the shaft bending as it begins to start heading up the  hole theres a sudden force of arcane energy that slams it even harder up into the top of this tiny  little slit  travis yeah good  matt as it goes up there you hear what sounds like a splintering of wood and metal then you  hear metal grinding you start seeing bits and chunks of grinding metal begin to pour out of the  hole and the pillars begin to scraping stone  laura hey  ashley /dung/ yeah  travis nice shot  ashley yeah vex  matt eventually coming to a halt  marisha a wrench in the machine  taliesin i could have done it  laura you totally could have done that  taliesin i could have made that shot  sam next rooms yours  taliesin yes next room next rooms all mine  orion that was one of those impossible things right  matt pretty damn close to impossible  orion i knew it  laura nice  marisha laughs pretty damn close to impossible  sam all right lets go across /none/ and heal our rogue  travis yeah we walk across  laura yeah all right  liam as they come to the other side i clutch my broken rib and injuredly hold a hand up and give a  halfassed highfive to my sister grunts  laura good job getting slammed into the roof like that  liam yeah youre welcome  laura yeah  matt all right  marisha so can we take a short rest to heal up and

into the fray  laura oh god okay  matt you guys after finishing your short rest healing up various wounds in that circumstance  sam plays note on flute  laughter  matt you make your way playing a fancy little ditty on the flute you /none/ make your way down this  long long staircase you continue down for id say probably a good hundred feet or so before you  start encountering ill say a mild change in the scenery at least what was normally just a musty  hallway is becoming thicker and thicker coated with large spiderwebs  laura ugh  travis awesome  orion everythings so sticky  ashley spiders  matt you manage to push through and cut through but it gets to the point where its just so matted  you guys are having to bushwhack your way through as /none/ if you had a machete  taliesin im not taking off my mask  travis can i turn to one of those clears throat scalebearers and ask if theyve ever dealt with  any umberhulks in this region  matt scalebearer vorak gives kind of a curious look to your question scalebearer desona looks to  you and says no i dont believe they exist in this region nor this close to the surface as far  as i know  travis right thats important isnt it  orion are the spiderwebs are they becoming more as we traverse  /none/ matt yes theyre getting thicker and thicker  orion okay so im going to make my way towards the front of the group because im noticing this  and im going to do a fire breath and im going to instantly cast control flame and catch as much  as i can of it and start spinning it burning the webs as we go  matt okay very cool so tiberius steps forward and breathes a heating breath of dragon fire out  of his mouth as it cascades forward burning through the nearby webs he casts a secondary  /none/ spell and captures it and begins to shape it almost like its a fiery clay in the middle of the  air and he utilizes it in a very similar way to how he uses telekinesis and begins to use that  rolling fire to burn through the webbing as you guys continue down the stairway  laura nice  taliesin thats convenient  marisha at least itll be disinfected  orion mmhmhm fire cleans all  matt it also leaves a terrible stench burning web has this awful kind of  travis burnt hair  matt its similar burnt /none/ hair with burnt plastic if you can think of it its awful  laura whats plastic  matt this is more for your own player knowledge sensory knowledge  laughter  matt the sound of crackling of the nearby webbing thats slowly retracting and burning and melting  is immediately joined by the sound of a low clicking  groaning  laura i stealth immediately  marisha oh that frickin sound do we i can try to cast pass without a trace on all of us if  we want to sneak through here  laura oh yeah that would /none/ be good  marisha do you want to try to sneak through  travis yeah do it  marisha i cast pass without a trace  travis now lets vogue  this changes every time  orion sweet  matt all right so pass without a trace is cast while you two both make stealth rolls  laura so with the pass without a trace  matt with the pass without a trace yes  laura 31  orion quietly to marisha is my magic on stealth too  liam 24  matt with the plus ten  liam plus /none/ ten from what say again  laura pass without a trace  matt keyleth cast pass without a trace  liam oh 34  matt all right you guys dart off to the side kind of using the remnants of the web to block  your physical forms the boiling fire that has been placed ahead of you is starting to reflect  small little points of reflected light throughout the shadows in the distance that are moving  towards you as you see giant hairy arachnid legs  orion i back up i have my cloak on and im /none/ going to go ahead and cast stoneskin thats what  i do right now  matt you cast stoneskin im going to go ahead and ask  marisha im also going to cast stoneskin  laura can i cast while theyre coming where did i write it down  sam im going to go invisible  laura never mind i cant find my spell  sam this is exciting guys theres a board of some sort  laura i cast entangle on the ground  matt in front  laura yeah  sam you have you can cast things  /none/ laura quickly yeah yeah yeah  orion quietly yeah shes a ranger she can cast stuff  travis apparently  taliesin as long as its at range  sam grog youve got a beard spell  travis i do  taliesin that was my terrible joke and i wish i hadnt now im embarrassed  travis i can also cast flatulence  sam and you have frenzied rage  matt all right you can now see skittering off to the side what appear to be a series of large  arachnidlike creatures as you cast entanglement you can  laura /none/ im reading it now  matt go ahead and read the spell  orion did i manage to catch with the control flame my entire fire breath when i did that and  im controlling it still  matt currently you are  laura oh thats not what it was thats the wrong spell sorry sorry its spike growth is  the spell  sam spikes growth  laura i cast spike growth  matt spike growth okay that is different  laura yes which is the ground in a 20foot radius centered on a point within range twists and /none/  sprouts hard spikes and thorns its difficult terrain for the duration but anybody that can see  me casting it doesnt take damage to it its only the people that dont see me casting it  marisha dope  sam really  matt all right  laura yeah any creature that cant see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a wisdom check  orion cool  sam all right but can they see the area  matt they can see the area  laura oh well thats not quite the same thing then what /none/ i saw yells forget it my spell is stupid  sam no no  orion its fine just not in a hallway with stairs  laura i know  sam its fine just stick to arrows really  ashley she can do so much more than just arrows  orion as i see this can i release my control flame and let the fire breath just happen and not  control it anymore  matt looking into your spell now oh control flames is a cantrip you are able to control just enough  fire to burn away the things /none/ it wouldnt actually do any damage if released control fire kind of  like captures an element of it  orion okay so thats what i was using the element of what i did  matt yeah  orion so i used it so i could have the fire  matt exactly  orion got it  matt you set it as a catalyst to it  laura they can see the ground  matt they can  laura then no dont cast it  travis doesnt it mess up the ground if we try to walk through it  /none/ laura not you guys but they  marisha but theyre spiders theyre probably not that wise  orion can i cast something else  matt no right now everyone rolls initiative  orion damn it  ashley ugh  matt there are only so many things you can do here tiberius  orion i know but i like doing lots of things  matt i know you do  marisha thats not bad ill take that  sam i lost my dice  laura thats my punishment  travis fuck yeah  taliesin i love my new stats  laura

be considered a net if we are considering /none/ a weapon that you are conjuring for this  ashley im just making it look really pretty  matt right  ashley basically  travis quietly it looks so pretty  matt so the effect of this im letting you hit multiple guys with this it would not do any  damage  ashley it wouldnt do any damage it would just contain them  matt it would possibly have an effect on their ability  ashley even if theyre thorny even like holy thorns oh  matt it would be very itchy for them  ashley all right you /none/ know what  orion oh well i mean thats not out of  laura i think you should stick with it its awesome  sam yeah man commit  ashley okay contain them  orion yeah its thematic  ashley contain them and then somebody could just  laura fireball  ashley throw fire a fireball at them  matt all right go ahead and roll a d20 and then add five to it  ashley okay 12  matt 12 okay  these four in the immediate front right there as you bring back your mace in the air /none/ you  kind of hang onto the side with the leather strap around your wrist you reach up and grab your holy  symbol as you release the holy symbol to hold your hand up divine energy streaks out from your  fingertips and forms into this kind of gold and silver net as your arm is doing this kind of  throwing animation in the air like that the net shoots out from the front and spreads down onto  the spiders and contracts around  you can see it catches them and they start scrambling inside these front /none/ four are considered  grappled  cheering  ashley all right all right  matt the one in the back managed to avoid it  orion cool  laura nice  marisha nice  matt thats it that brings it to keyleth  marisha okay with that new development  orion wait can you do lightning  marisha i can im

sam singing along with the battle music its the music that means were /none/ having a fight  matt all right so this one succeeds so no damage but these two take damage go ahead and  roll it  marisha okay so they take 2d12 six ugh seven damage  matt seven damage to each  marisha its not great i think he takes half damage though even though he fails  matt does he i think poison mist  marisha poison

front of the spiders  marisha youre good youre in front  liam okay theres a little bit of distance so im just going to start hucking daggers at them  im going to start with dagger of life stealing  marisha youre only two squares away  liam that is a 16 to hit  matt /none/ 16 to hit hits  liam okay so that is four six is ten of damage  matt all right  liam then the keen dagger follows that is a 27  matt that hits  liam that hits for ten damage and then  laura youre killing them  liam and then the flametongue dagger  matt youre not hasted anymore by the way  liam youre right forget it yeah forget that last thats right two  matt so as youre off to the side hiding among the slowly burning webbing you move around huck  both daggers /none/ one strikes a spider right in the center of where its eyes are and it screeches for  a second before it curls up its legs kind of pulling into its torso the other one begins to  pull out of the net that pike set and as it does you throw the secondary dagger it strikes it in  its abdomen and the blade retracts and returns to your belt and as it does it leaves this streak  of greenish liquid and you have a better view of these spiders now go ahead and make a nature  /none/ check both keyleth and vex  marisha dope  orion by the way im here but im also there  marisha natural 20  yelling  matt youre also there  orion cloak of displacement  laura good because i rolled an eight  matt oh  orion theres like two of me  matt all right so keyleth  sam whistles with the battle music  matt you notice as most spiderlike creatures go youre used to like the darker furry wolfspider  types these have a different color their physical bodies are more white and blue their  /none/ coloration is mostly white but with a kind of bluish hue to it and their eyes are almost  pinkwhite in color  laura ugh  ashley because they live underground theres no sunlight  matt theyre a very strange different kind of spider  liam i dont like this  marisha is that all i know with my natural 20  matt you havent encountered too many types of arachnids but theres something about them that  seems loosely themed in the ethereal  laura oh  marisha hm  matt you in your experience youve heard of certain /none/ spiders that can travel through the planes  rapidly  orion now damn plane spiders  travis maybe we dont have to kill it maybe they just pfft  marisha gotcha  hey guys i think these are like magical bamfing spiders  orion oh  taliesin okay  sam cool bro lets kill them  marisha yeah lets kill them  taliesin theres one spider thats not caught  laura theres what theres three spiders left  matt yes one back here  taliesin all right im going to take a couple of shots at it with my sharpshooter /none/ so lets start  with 24 to hit  matt what was it  taliesin 24 to hit  matt that hits  taliesin and lets do this my first shot  sam kapew  taliesin thats depressing  well i get the bonus so thats 18 points of damage  matt 18 points of damage all righty  marisha thats not too depressing  ashley thats not depressing at all  travis thats not depressing  taliesin thats not too depressing its because im taking a negative five to hit  laura oh  taliesin and thats oh thats /none/ not bad i have new numbers 16 to hit  matt 16 does also hit yeah  taliesin aha  matt same target  taliesin same target with an added fire bonus three fire damage and 17 as well  matt all right  taliesin 17 plus three fire damage  ashley that bonus is awesome  laura he is so dead  matt gunshot noise that spider gets splattered you see theres a burst of flame and a explosion  noise as its body is knocked in the air torn asunder and then consumed by the flame burst at /none/  the same time you see what looks like a scattering of ash across the ground and the steps  beneath it  marisha it looks like flash paper  matt essentially yeah  taliesin and i duck back behind grog  laughter  travis where are you going  matt all right these two spiders that are currently caught in the net both whoosh vanish  and the net falls flat  laura oh bamfing spiders  matt teleportation noise  taliesin oh shit  matt one is striking at you  laura me  matt that is a /none/ 21 to hit  laura it hits me  matt and against percy that is a 25  taliesin oh my god that hits  matt all right you both take 13 points of piercing damage  taliesin ow  matt and i need you both to make a constitution saving throw  groaning  taliesin oh bugger  marisha that cant be good  taliesin 13 points of piercing damage  matt mmhm  marisha they poofed poofers  laura 17 oh wait 19  matt 19 constitution saving throw  taliesin constitution saving throw blows raspberry  marisha /none/ oh no percy  taliesin rolled a one  matt so as all of a sudden the strange teleportation noise sound streaks behind you  you turn over your shoulder just in time to see the spiders pop out of seemingly nowhere and  strike into you the fangs sink into your side and you knock them off with your elbow  laura grunts in pain  matt you feel the venom extract itself from the fangs but just as you pull it out of the side  so it actually does not envenom your body percy youre not so /none/ lucky the venom pulses into the  side of your shoulder  taliesin groans in pain  matt and you feel this burning sensation ripple through your entire upper right torso you take 21  points of poison damage  marisha oh shit  liam what was that number again  all 21  sam hes fine hes fine  marisha is that all it does just poison him  matt yep  taliesin i am poisoned though  matt you are not considered poisoned its the damage thats poison  laura oh its straightup damage  marisha okay thats /none/ not too bad  taliesin it could be worse  matt that ends their turn tiberius youre still holding your turn grog  travis mmhm  marisha i did take protection from poison  laura i should cast that on us  marisha if thats necessary  matt all right tiberius  orion so were in a hallway a stairwell  matt yes its a stairway heading down essentially right here and then it evens out at  the bottom point there  marisha fighting on the stairs  orion is it like a big  matt its about 15 /none/ feet up to the ceiling ten 15  orion oh very well  how many are left two  matt two  laura yeah  orion obelisk of stone  matt okay  marisha squishy spiders  orion yeah these squishy spiders  matt so as both the spiders are knocked off both percy and vex you guys kind of rear back ready  to defend yourselves suddenly the stairwell shakes for a second and pillars of stone go stone  crushing noises from underneath similar to the trap room you encountered earlier  orion thats it 21  matt /none/ 21 and whats the dc on your spell  orion 17  matt 17 both spiders get mashed pretty horribly into the ceiling you see where the pillars are  slammed into the ceiling permanently you can see the legs kind of dangling out for a second and then  slowly curl in towards where the edge of the stone pillars are at the ceiling  laura eat it  marisha are there any corpses that are more accessible than the one that got torched and the  ones that are squished  travis yeah are there any spider fangs /none/ we can put in the bag  marisha yeah because i have that book that helps me do that now  taliesin theres the one i shot  matt you can actually there are theres one that you shot no actually the one that you  killed is the one that burst into flame  taliesin yes the one that burst into flame  matt that ones not going to be salvageable theres a few that you and vex killed vex and vax  both just kind of wiped out a few of the spiders go ahead and make an /none/ herbalism roll  laura ooh i bet we can get some of that poison dip the arrows in it  marisha what did the book do again gave me a plus or an advantage did it give me an advantage  on rolls or like a plus something  matt i asked you to write that down i will say advantage  marisha oh wait you did ask me to write it down and i think i did  matt advantage or a bonus which of the two is it  marisha oh no i didnt write it down i /none/ just wrote that i have the books  matt ah i dont remember what i did for that  i will say advantage thats the easiest to

the stonework  sam skipping  ashley percy 18  taliesin 18 thank you  laura scanlan no groans  matt into what is a large central chamber you can see webbing scattered throughout the entirety  of the stone room its about 60 feet up there is very low light from the flickering sconces that  are on the walls of this towards the base /none/ of the actual room the building in the center it looks  almost like an ancient mausoleum structure how its placed in the center of the room closed  stone doors but what catches your eye is that the entirety of the structure seems to be crafted of  the same platinumlike material as the container that you guys are carrying the horn in  laura oh wow  sam oh we made it  laura are there sapphires all over the walls in here then  matt not the walls of the actual chamber itself just this central building /none/ right there  orion were not stealing from this place  matt go ahead and make a perception check anyone who wishes to look for traps  sam while

check for 25  taliesin 21  matt perception  taliesin perception 21  matt okay 25 for arcane  orion yeah  /none/ matt best you can gather as far as the presence of any arcane in this room the scrolling on the  structure in front of you there are elements of the scrolling that you can see are based in the  arcane runes that are used for ritual inscribing but theres nothing of any magic that youve ever  been familiar with that is utilized in this structure what did you roll  laura really really high eight  matt all right so who is moving in who wants to  sam i moved in with grog  travis i

large one  laura good to know  travis shit  ashley ugh  laura whispers lots of spiders lots im going to cast protection from poison on myself  matt all right  travis i cast terminix  taliesin laughs

right you are also considered invisible  sam why greater  orion because i can cast and still stay invisible  matt all right kima pushes ahead through the group while you guys are doing this walks up to the  front of the chamber and you see she takes the holy symbol around from her neck the symbol of  bahamut and much like she did to the doorway at the bottom /none/ of the temple earlier to find this  initial passageway she feels around in the scrolling and eventually finds a section of it and  rotates what looks like a circular part of it that shifts and then pulls out when she pulls it out  you can see there is a kind of engraving there is a recessed engraving of the same shape as her holy  symbol  laura before she touches anything can i let her know that theres a whole lot of spiders on the  other side of the room  matt you may do /none/ that  sam wait what you didnt tell any of us that  travis can i shift to her right flank just at the corner of the mausoleum structure  right there  laura just so everybodys aware those things we just fought theres a ton more of them on the  other side of this little chamber  sam oh thanks for telling us  laura no problem  matt grog make a stealth check  marisha whispers be very quiet  travis oh shit natural 20  cheering  taliesin spiderman  laura good thing you took that /none/ beard off because it had bells and shit in it  travis oh the beard

moment there you recess into your old hunter training when you were traveling with  your barbarian tribe and you take in the darkness around you and walk fleet of foot to the edge of  it not making a single sound youre damn /none/ proud of yourself  travis i am  taliesin whispers quietly  matt so as you tell this to kima she goes whispers what spiders  laura whispers lots and lots of spiders is that going to make noise  matt whispers i dont know i havent been in this chamber before  laura perhaps we should deal with the spiders before we make noise or maybe just be prepared  in fact you know what im going to cast spike growth on the ground in between where theyre  going to have to walk through  marisha ooh good /none/ smartypants  laura because they cant freaking see it right now can they

/none/ orion id like to walk up as i see this going on im going to take out my deck of illusions im  going to toss two cards both ways two cards on each side so im going to do this real quick  laura question that chamber in the center of the room does it go all the way to the ceiling or is it  matt no there is a gap  orion deck of illusions everyone  laura so theres a huge so technically the spiders could crawl up the ceiling and drop down  on us /none/  travis yes  matt in theory  taliesin why would you give him ideas like that just feed him irony  travis lets go  orion ten of hearts yes joker queen of hearts and another joker what  sam what does that mean  matt wait you threw  orion i put two on each side  matt oh two on each side  orion yeah so like two over in the spot before all

me  laura ooh thats awesome  matt all right so a secondary tiberius appears right there  orion falsetto hello everyone  marisha you know you make a good woman  orion falsetto tiberiosa  matt female tiberius appears over on that side  marisha tiberiosa  orion and then whichever side you decide a queen of hearts and ten of hearts  matt queen of hearts oh interesting  travis falsetto leviosa not leviosa  /none/ matt a succubus appears over here winged  marisha well thats fun  matt sorry what was the other one that you said  orion queen of hearts and a ten of hearts  matt ten of hearts a cloud giant on this side of the room  laura what  orion explosion noise  ashley rad  matt well use that mini for now its fine all of a sudden appear kind of translucent their  image flickering its not a great illusion but its enough where it catches some attention  orion and theyre positioned right before the /none/ messes of each side  matt like right there  orion yeah  matt all righty kimas now sitting there like whispers put the key in now  sam no no do it  taliesin yes yes go  marisha okay youre good go for it yeah  matt she puts her symbol into the recess as it does the stone doors shift and theres a dull  kind of creaking of the stone as it slides not open but into the walls revealing an interior  that is as the light filters in the entirety of the wall floor /none/ and ceiling of this room is of  the same scrolling the same platinumsapphire material as the outside of the building and the  box thats there except for the design seems to all filter in towards the center like the center  of a spiderweb all the design coalesces to the center point  laura had to be a spiderweb  matt its not an actual spiderweb theres a raised dais up in the center there about four  feet wide about a halffoot thick kima kind of takes her symbol and puts it back around her neck  /none/ and kind of motions like this the two scalebearers begin to move down carrying the  case looking about the rest of you like  orion i invisibly follow right behind the box still keeping my illusions in check  matt all right  ashley same same same  matt everyone holds in place  marisha yeah im not going to move far away  ashley following  travis as you will  marisha no no no no  matt youre staying right there  marisha yeah yeah if i held let me shift one over just so im not /none/ in trinkets way the other  way yeah  matt there you go all right so as they enter the chamber kima enters as well you guys filing  in behind them i need you all to make stealth checks  travis and laura everybody  matt no tiberius with advantage because youre invisible  liam what kind of check  sam stealth  travis not you  matt not you dont worry about it  ashley i dont  matt you do  orion 17  ashley three  laughter  sam clang clang clang  matt so you /none/ step into the chamber losing your footing for a moment on the smooth kind of  platinumlike ridges across the ground and you kind of catch yourself your plate hitting the  ground with a loud ting sound at which point the two scalebearers kind of look at you  ashley whispers sorry sorry  matt with a heavy sigh and kima goes go go go they both step forward and take and place the  box into the center of the room on top of the dais as they both release the chains the box  seems to levitate /none/ on its own to the center of the room much like how the horn itself ascended and  was kept aloft in the center of the box the box lifts up and slowly begins to rotate on its own  as it does you can see the sapphire bits that are ingrained on this box flash with a bright blue  light and all of a sudden the blue energy spreads into the ceiling and the floor of this  room and all of the blue and silver veins that are carved into this begin to glow with a similar /none/ blue  light  sam cool  marisha cool  orion i love light  matt at which point the doors begin to  sam which doors  matt the doors you guys entered this room through begin to close  sam ah we should leave  orion im going to scootch  matt yeah you guys immediately scootch out of the way kima darts off both of them turn around  and start running back  sam whispers theyre going to die  matt they both make it out  ashley oh thats good  matt they both manage /none/ to just squeeze through real fast as the doors slam behind  marisha that would be terrifying  matt at which point you see a series of spiders beginning to try to cut around these here  whats the dc on your  sam my spell  matt your spell yeah  sam 17 because i didnt do it through the hand cone  matt yeah  laura whispers why  marisha should we run  matt both of these spiders get disoriented and try to find their way through the stinking cloud  kind of like choking clicking noises /none/  marisha yeah whos going to be back down here theoretically  orion the guards could come back  matt none of them make their way through the rest of these begin coming forward whats the  roll they have to make for the spiky growth  laura 14  taliesin to repair the room that we broke anyway  matt 14 both missed their save whats the damage on that  laura thats 2d4 for every five feet crossed  matt they would probably be skittering around here halfway through before they changed  trajectory so 1d4 2d4  /none/ laura 2d4 for every five feet  matt so 10d4 each  marisha nice  matt they come charging around the corner rapidly skittering noises  marisha 10d4 thats cool  orion oh nice what  marisha for her thorns  orion whispers sweet thorns  marisha my little sister once fell into a rose bush  sam good story  marisha it was very painful  orion good story laughs  i once fell into a fire ant hill  marisha that sucks too  orion it was very painful i was riding my bike it sucked  laura /none/ 22  matt 22 both of these spiders stop in place looking severely messed up and damaged and just  kind of hold their ground looking very confused you see crawling up over the top of this  structure one large white and bluish spider that leaps up as this is happening you guys are  noticing that blue energy is cracking through the floor and now following the pattern across the  entirety of the structure it crawls up the walls  marisha oh  matt  and that blue energy reaches to the ceiling and illuminates it and /none/ what you missed  when you entered the room is you can see recessed into the ceiling of this room four large humanoid  entities that are just currently held aloft buried in the ceiling of platinum armor  orion go  travis weve got to go weve got to go  matt one of them suddenly flashes dislodges and whoosh thud squashing the spider in the  process  yelling  marisha what is that  matt just spider screech croak screeching sound the spider slowly tries to curl in place  the giant platinum golem now slamming on /none/ top and squishing on top you see as it slowly comes to  stand each hand holding these giant platinum cleavers you suddenly hear a voice ringing  through your heads collectively get out  laura whispers we should get out  orion you heard the man you heard him you heard him the earrings everybody heard him  sam wait can we just leave the thing here with the golem  laura golems are meant to protect  orion its going to kill everything there  sam oh then lets go  travis yeah  matt all right so /none/ all of you guys start bolting out i want everyone to go ahead and make a  dexterity check  marisha okay yeah sure  orion 13  matt all right anyone lower than a ten  travis what about on a ten  marisha no  matt lower than a ten  orion quietly we all got above ten  matt anyone  all right you as well  ashley 14  matt awesome  laughter  orion even pike  matt you guys all come darting out of the room except for kima who rolls a one  /none/ so all of you guys come running out of the room  sam kimas dead  marisha kima  matt the rest of the scalebearers come rushing out theyre no longer encumbered by the box  kimas kind of helping everyone get by trying to keep everyone at bay being the hero as she turns  around the first one comes leaping off of the structure runs towards her and gives one giant  sweep with one of its blades  ooh yeah thatll hit you see the blade streak across the front of her silver armor she  takes /none/ 24 points of slashing damage it sends her flying back ten feet with the sheer force of it  but she manages to roll out of it yeah with an acrobatics check catching herself to her feet and  just keeps bolting behind the rest of you guys  laura can i see  matt you now see behind two more crash crash dislodging from the ceiling as the one thats  charging after you is coming up the stairway through this were now going into a skill  challenge as you guys are rushing out  laura oh god /none/  travis must go faster must go faster  sam skill challenge  marisha skill challenge  ashley ah go go  orion yeah all right run for your life  marisha we havent done this in a while  matt now as youre running to get through theres still bits of webbing still in the way i  need everyone to go ahead and make another dexterity check  sam all right doing good  orion yes  taliesin yeah  marisha oh okay yeah yeah sure  orion 21  laura 25  taliesin 22  travis 21 /none/  liam 26  ashley 17  marisha 11  taliesin 22  matt all right  sam 19  matt all right as you guys are all charging up kind of helping each other but also clamoring to  get through kima is rushing up and you can see where one of the scalebearers has now tripped and  fallen on the stairs  sam oh no  matt she runs past leans back to reach her hand out as the golem comes up behind  marisha no  matt  with two hands swings down with both blades /none/  sam against kima again  matt no this is against one of the scalebearers  sam oh okay  taliesin oh no  laura should i be rolling for trinket  matt im considering trinket with you so no  marisha too late just leave them  laura okay thank you  matt well do that next round because i forgot theres a lot of things to consider one of them  hits the stone and just streaks off sparks flying through the air illuminating the space  secondarily however the other scalebearer takes 28 points of slashing damage /none/ from the blow as it  reaches up again for a second blow kima reaches down and grabs desonas arm and lifts her up off  her feet and they both go charging forward you guys make your way up the stairway as you see now  the golem pushing its way through  orion im going to dissipate my card illusion and im going to cast fly on myself so im hovering  matt okay  marisha how much of a gap is there between the last trailingbehind scalebearer and the golem  matt well now that kimas got /none/ them theyre rushing up and theres about a tenfoot 15foot  gap now  laura okay  marisha im going to turn around and do wall of stone boof  matt okay as they rush past a wall of stone slams up as the golem goes smashing into it  orion ill do support ill do obelisk right behind it too  matt all right so as you guys come rushing up to the top of this you guys are just doing the stone  wall obelisk obelisk obelisk well say you cast it twice to go ahead and reinforce /none/  marisha boof  matt all right you hear the impact from behind you hear stone crack and break and you see two of  the pillars that you put up impact dust and bits of rock shoot out but it settles apparently its  holding strong and you start hearing slamming of some sort of heavy weight behind it  marisha right run  matt as well as the following of additional giant heavy footsteps its now got its reinforcements  caught up to it you guys charge into the room with the broken trap which now has  /none/ partially raised platforms youre rushing around and trying to find your way through you get to  the other side of the room theres now an entirety a room filled with mist in front of you  laura gasps oh no  marisha i still have it i can gust of wind thats my last 3rdlevel spell  matt okay all right gust of wind im going to ask all of you guys to make a wisdom check as you  rush through  marisha including me  matt everyone  sam wisdom check or saving throw  matt this /none/ is a wisdom check  marisha just adding your wisdom  ashley natural 20  laura what what  matt nice  ashley 24  marisha saving throw or just your ability modifier  orion 12  matt ability modifier  taliesin oh  marisha okay 16  orion i thought it was

keyleths focusing and getting the wind to escape keyleth rushes up kima comes through with  the two scalebearers everyone comes through grogs bringing up the back you can see now in  the back behind him a giant bladewielding fist as the golem comes smashing through the wall the  rest of you guys ushering grog along grog comes running hears the sound looks over his shoulder  and in the chaos of it his trajectory is off and he ends up brushing into the side of the mist  laura oh no  matt grog go ahead and /none/ make a dexterity saving throw  travis 12  matt you end up taking 24 points of fire damage as the pillars spin unleashing a torrent of flame  travis no bad car wash bad car wash  marisha laughs bad car wash  laura oh no grog your beard has been singed  orion oh  travis what  laughter  matt you reach up instinctively you feel its as smooth as a baby goliaths face  laughter  orion all that work  matt as you guys charge up the rest of the staircase  orion is grog /none/ behind us now like the furthest away  matt hes just caught up to you guys as youre rushing up the staircase you get to the final  door you exit as kima rushes everyone through she brings out her holy symbol real fast and as  she pulls it off her neck you see the first golem reach the bottom of the staircase it begins  looming up  orion were leaving what are you doing  marisha yeah go home go home bad golem  taliesin i take a  matt kima takes out her holy symbol and /none/ holds it aloft in front of her and says under her breath  murmurs at which point it begins to glow with this extremely vibrant glow as it does you see a  symbol emblazoned on the front of the golem and it flashes with light as it stops and just kind of  holds its place and waits and kima looks at the symbol like i wasnt sure that was going to  work she takes  orion tell it to go kill the spider  matt she takes the symbol and puts it back in the side of /none/ the stone door that originally was closed  the doors slowly seal shut once again she pulls the symbol out and she falls to her knees  breathing heavily  sam oh kima  marisha we did it  travis next time lead with that  orion i agree grog very well said  matt it kind of happened very quickly im sorry  ashley all right do some people need to be healed  taliesin oh dear  laura yeah  sam kima for sure  orion im actually okay  marisha im all right im all right  /none/ taliesin im fine  sam oh grogs got a burnt face  travis no i want to wear this pain as a remembrance of my beard  laura you can grow it back grog  orion its okay big fella  matt you make your way back up to the main chamber where high bearer vord is currently  waiting for you  sam oh this guy  matt he turns to you as you enter so i am to assume that your journey was a success  orion yes surprisingly so it went off without a hitch well no /none/  laura youve got some good security down there  marisha very good  matt i told you once its instilled it will be safe  laura a little warning next time would be great  ashley 25 points of healing  matt there you go  orion youre really a girl on fire now  marisha that really heals me up then  taliesin that will top me off very nicely  marisha ill take that  orion well done everyone by the way  laura yeah  taliesin that couldve gone worse  marisha it could have gone /none/ worse  matt at which point the high bearer vord kind of raises his hand yonn if you do not mind and  yonn kind of shuffles forward  sam yonn  orion such a bore  marisha yawn  matt excuse me im right here  orion it was a play on words your name also means something that you do when youre tired  marisha yeah  matt i dont like you  laughter  matt he reaches out and puts a big old sack of coins in your hands  laura oh ill hold onto that  /none/ orion of course  taliesin we should mention you may have to have one of the rooms repaired  orion i take a couple out  taliesin the spinning column  sam circle of death  laura yeah  taliesin may have gotten  laura a little broken we thought were maybe just disarming it but i think we probably broke it  taliesin we put an arrow into it  travis tearfully if you find the remnants of a glorious beard preserve it  laura oh grog actually  travis what  laura ive got some remnants of a /none/ lovely beard  and i try to smush it onto his chin  travis it is not the same  matt it is not the same  laura it looks pretty good  matt it is not the same  laura dang it  matt at which point the high bearer turns to you pike mighty cleric i see this meeting  though it escaped my vision before that you bear the holy sigil of the dawnflower the lady of  redemption herself while we may walk under different stars i offer these words that caught  my ear naught /none/ but a week ago in an excavation beneath the toppled tower of syrac the  longcursed ruin that sat like a blemish upon this city for hundreds of years it was revealed that  perhaps the five holy paths that began here at vasselheim there may indeed now be a sixth  sam what  matt a forgotten temple to sarenrae has been uncovered crumbled lost and without light it  sat forever and a day and few are around in this city of her guiding flame to recover and restore  its glory perhaps you should look into it /dung/  ashley i will gladly look into it  matt the ruin lies to the west of here at the base of the citys mountain look for the dark  stone ruin nevertheless i thank you for your time kima if you wouldnt mind we have some  things to discuss as well  marisha oh quick vorg  matt vord high bearer vord  marisha vord  taliesin vord  laura highbearer vord  matt was that so hard yes  marisha vord you wouldnt have happened to hear of maybe a druid tribe called the fire ashari  /none/ they call their little hometown pyrah do you happen to know maybe  matt he gives you a keen look and says there has been talk of a rogue band of druids not more  than two days travel in the lets see where did i put the maps here he thinks to himself for  a moment considering it towards the sunder peak mountain range dangerous territory fraught with  volcanic activity yet these folks seem to call it home  marisha is sunder peak like west or east to where we  matt southwest of the city its /none/ hard to miss  marisha southwest  matt look for the plumes of sulfurous smoke  laura is the temple to sarenrae on the way to the  matt the temple to sarenrae is on the same mountain that this temple is built on  laura oh  matt to the west of here follow the mountain base  marisha oh so we can stop there first  orion yes its close it seems  laura all of us can  orion before we part you seem to be quite learned about many things that i am not have you /none/  ever heard of anything called the gods hammer or the pale stone or any particular artifact ropes  of mercy perhaps  matt i cant say i have unfortunately  orion of course  matt but i shall keep this in mind should the information come my way  orion thank you i bow  matt he gives you a look a quick glance and notes for the record while your color is not  what it was when you first entered know that the great platinum dragon sees through this guise to  the heart beneath  orion /none/ yes thank you for noticing i agree with the same sentiment and i bow in the draconic  fashion  matt well kima business thank you all very much and he kind of lends his hands out as he  extends his hand the doors on the opposite side of the room open up  laura magic thought it was banned  matt for the sake of brevity because we have people who have to leave on this very soon it  doesnt take you long to find your way across the city you find some of the citys bastions /none/  standing guard on the outskirts of this crumpled tower ruin its like black and sootcovered  stone that looks like a plot of land that has been left untouched like once it fell no one wanted  anything to do with it you speak with the bastions and they eventually let you through  especially given the aid of those youve walked with since arrival you come to the ruin and you  can see theres about a 40foot gap in this pile of stone that is a recess in the ground almost  like a small sinkhole it /dung/ looks like there is some sort of excavation that has been set here very  haphazard there is very simple wood boards that have been placed into the side of this small  sinkhole to allow relatively comfortable though a bit rickety descent into the structure as you make  your way down your eyes adjust to the little bit of daylight that spills into this dark  subterranean cavern there before you you see a surprisingly glorious sight a simple structure of  brass and polished limestone ancient as the day is long one of the walls has partially /none/ collapsed  and you see what looks like three figures rummaging through the debris an older human  woman who is being helped by two others a young man of blond hair and simple clothes and an older  gnome thats carrying a crutch under his arm theyre all in the process of collecting and  setting aside and cleaning up various things that have been recovered from this temple you  immediately see against the brass structure the very simplified symbol of the wings of sarenrae  multiple times across the structure in various incarnations this is very much /none/ indeed a lost  temple of sarenrae  laura whispers wow pike  ashley whispers wow  sam so when youve fully excavated it you can come back and check it out  ashley yes  orion or you can stay here and restore it  matt at which point the older woman sees you guys walk down and says please theres nothing  to take nothing but history and rock i guarantee you bandits are not welcome here  ashley no no no i take out my symbol and i say no no no im here to help  /none/ matt you can hear an audible gasp from her she says my eyes dont deceive oh my i am sorry  my name is gesyra a simple painter but one of as far as i know the three devoted to the lady of  the everlight here in vasselheim and now a fourth i dont know where you came from but  would you stay with us for a bit and help us rebuild bring her name into the light amongst the  others here in vasselheim restore it to its glory  ashley tearfully yes oh man i dont /none/ want to leave you guys  matt it shouldnt take long especially with your help and we can bring the light into the  heart of others and you can see the two other kind of joined her at the side and they all look at you with  this look of hope that you can probably tell from the crinkles in their face they havent had in  quite some time and they look up to you in their simple clothes as the first true strong bastion  for sarenrae that theyve seen in a long time with that /none/ pike you get to turn to the rest of  the group  ashley well i think this is a pilgrimage i have to take so vox machina keep your eyes out i  will contact you every once in a while if i can and we will meet up once this is completed all in  travis right  ashley vox machina on three one two three  all vox machina  orion tearfully you will be missed very much pike  ashley im going to miss you guys very much  matt and on that note we have /none/ to close because people are in a rush yeah ashley will be leaving  us for a time shes going to new york for a few months to shoot a web a television series  laughter  sam a little web series  matt a wonderful television series she has recurring were really happy and proud of her  were just a jumble of emotions under the circumstances  ashley you guys have been so amazing and have made this
