none	 you grabbed caduceus and led  him into the city of zadash the largest city youve ever seen by leaps and bounds to see what  kind of ways you can corrupt this new fresh mind free out of the savalierwood  laura its so exciting  matt that is where we left off in this case guys we have roughly two weeks of downtime im  going to go around and ask what you would like to accomplish and if moments require rolls moments  require roleplay anything like that well jump into it i would like to say 
none	 who wants to go first  travis oh god one two three not it  taliesin marisha and laura not it  taliesin liam  sam i didnt say not it would you like to go liam  liam not it  travis yeah come on piggly wiggly  sam sure not much okay the things i wrote down were i would like to use my money  laura your money  sam to buy a bunch of baubles and trinkets and buttons and ribbons and string and beads and one  crescent ornament  matt okay i will say 
none	 you could purchase all of those things and youre buying these yourself  sam in disguise self mode  matt okay yeah id say you could buy all of those things with lets say a single gold  because your charisma isnt that high a single gold piece for all of that thats priced up a bit  sam and laura thats pretty good  sam i will put all of that stuff into a package and mail it away with a note that i sent you  earlier matt  matt yep i have that  sam okay step 
none	 two im going to take my gun  travis your what  sam oh i stole a gun you werent there for that  matt no that was on the way out of hupperdook they werent there for that  sam i stole a gun  travis you got a gat  sam i stole a gun from a guard ive got one bullet  travis yeah like one round single shot  sam yeah dont fuck with me man i will blow you away motherfucker  travis oh shit okay  sam unless i miss and then its nothing 
none	 no i would like to take apart the gun id like to take  apart the gun and figure out how the hammer works how the gunpowder ignites is it a pack of powder  like a bullet or is it loose powder with a ball  matt well first off do you have or own tinkerers tools  sam no but do any of you guys  marisha have what  sam tinkerers tools ill go and buy them  matt this next expense will be 50 gold pieces for the set of tinkerers tools  sam no problem 
none	  matt i would need you to make a tinkering check to see if you can successfully disassemble the gun  sam does anyone want to help me  matt without ruining elements of it  laura i dont think any of us have enough experience to help you  liam caleb would help  sam do you have tinkering experience  liam no but im pretty smart  matt youre not proficient in tinkerers tools so its basically a straight intelligence check  add your intelligence modifier to see if you can figure out the safest way to do 
none	 so  sam i rolled a 14 and i have an intelligence of plus three  matt it takes you a little bit of time but you manage to very carefully disassemble the entirety  of the pistol without any issues  sam im specifically curious about how the impact of the hammer creates an explosion  matt through the words of the man responsible for inventing these things naught but 20plus years  beforehand if you would like to explain  laura oh my goodness  taliesin there is a flash pan where theres a preload powder basically a 
none	 powder capsule  attaches to a flash pan the hammer contains a sparking mechanism that hits a plate causes a  spark to hit the powder in the flash pan goes into the gunpowder thats within thats actually  packed inside of the barrel and sends the shot out  sam is it a specific kind of metal that makes a spark  taliesin it actually is a specific kind its a flint  sam its a flint metal  taliesin although people have probably gotten creative with that at that time but the percy  tech was just a 
none	 flint he was trying to do other stuff and always failed  sam with that knowledge i will purchase any other materials i will need to do this im going  to take out the 20 arrows i grabbed from the iron shepherds house im going to try to modify them  using multiple arrowheads if needed to make an explosive arrowhead thats packed with some  gunpowder  taliesin it would be a bag at the front with a flint that would spark on pressure so as long as  you fired it hard it would cause the spark 
none	 when it hit and detonate  matt make a tinker check  sam another tinkerers check im not a good tinkerer  laura ooh look at your dice  sam 11 plus three  laura where did you get those  sam i got them for free from somebody  laura those are so pretty  marisha theyre from norse foundry  sam from norse foundry just a 14  matt id say itll cost you an additional 20 gold in materials because you fail multiple times  going through and end up wasting a lot of materials until eventually 
none	 you get it right and  youre certain that this would be the one that would function properly so you have one explosive  arrow youre not entirely certain what it does  sam one explosive arrow  taliesin welcome to tinkering man  sam ill take the parts of the gun its apart now right  matt yeah theyre separate individual pieces  sam i cant put it back together  matt you can certainly try  sam all right ill try thats a 15  matt you reassemble it it looks to be functional  sam okay and 
none	 i will look at it and say whoever invented this was a very smart person she must  have been a very very smart person indeed  taliesin oh she was  sam okay then i have one explosive arrow maybe great id also like to purchase a pair of gloves  or have them made  matt for show or comfort  sam for comfort and show human skin color with little fingernails embroidered at the end  matt laughs all right so you have this commissioned  sam yes  matt because it is a commission and it 
none	 is specific itd probably be at the similar store  to where beau got her reversible cloak made earlier in the campaign it would only take maybe two days  to get the materials together to match the color you wanted and then the embroidery and finishing  the gloves for your size specifically since youd be a smaller frame all in all id say five gold  pieces which is pricey for a set of custom gloves but not based on the money you had made  sam oh also with that package i sent earlier i also included 
none	 100 gold pieces in it  matt okay so mark that off  sam and then one last thing id like to approach jester and ask her jester  laura yes  sam i need your help  laura what do you need help with  sam you are a talented artiste  laura yes i am very talented  sam but also youve mentioned in the past that you are an expert forger  laura yes i am have you seen my work remember  sam ive seen you draw dicks on things  laura well also ive written

none	 first letter  matt exactly i would like you to roll a general dexterity check for me  laura did you see that it was really trying dexterity check ten  matt okay theres a difference between sealing wax and candle wax how do i know this because  ive made that mistake before sealing letters for previous dd campaigns you manage to press your  ring into the wax and pull back and now theres mush on the end of your ring and theres a  circular piece of mushed soft wax where the seal should be  laura

none	  marisha i want to go to pumat  matt okay midday you make your way to the pentamarket to the very vibrant center area of the  marketplace there theres a number of intersecting pathways that help divide between all  the various carts and tents that open up at this point id say its maybe late morning or so a  lot of the curled up curtains in the front are being affixed to the top or have been for a while  the smells of fresh baked goods cooking stews and various other treats and snacks that 
dung	 are being  presented as part of the shopping experience catch your nostrils as you move through you hear music  playing in the distance for all the chaos that life has thrown you in the past 30 days it feels  nice to step into a place thats so filled with life and lack of understanding of how dark the  world is at the fringes of this empire both with the war going on and some of the things youve  encountered its nice to step into this space and you catch yourself instinctually smiling and  finding 
none	 it infectious to brighten your mood you turn to see the darkened green wood with gold  accoutrements that marks the exterior of the invulnerable vagrant the front door is closed  but appears to be not locked for any particular reason  marisha i have such a clear picture in my head now that weve built it  matt now that weve physically built it yeah its a little larger inworld than the one that we did  marisha but the aesthetic  matt but the aesthetic is there yeah as you step forward the door opens up and 
dung	 leads you  inside and there the same warmly lit interior with the glowing chandelier above greets you  across the way sitting behind the desk face down in a book one of the various pumats who looks up  and oh why hello there yeah oh its been a while sorry took me a second to recognize  you youre very silhouetted by the bright sunshine outside you right now and its a bit dark  interior so come on up  marisha we do always seem to come around 400pm right when the sun is coming in the 
none	 window  laura i run in  matt another pumat comes around the corner and goes oh do we have folks in here yeah dont  worry pumat i got them taken care of oh theres even more coming in  taliesin oh yeah cool twins right thats cool i like this place this is nice  marisha pumat iii this is caduceus  matt caduceus why its a pleasure to meet you as well  taliesin its a pleasure to meet you  matt dont see many of our kind wandering around these large establishments  taliesin youre the 
none	 first one ive seen in the city so far thats pretty crazy this is  nice is this yours  matt well its ours well its his hey prime you might want to step out of the workshop  for a second you hear some rustling and grumbling in the background and the curtain opens  and you see a third one of them step out goggles affixed to the head a little bit of smudges of  dirt on the edges of the chin what are you talking about oh my goodness  taliesin youre all brothers then theres 
none	 three of you now triplets thats great thats great  dont see that very often  matt where are you from to be perfectly honest we havent really run into any other firbolgs  really since we came here  taliesin oh me neither im actually from up north im traveling with these kids working on  something its nice  matt wow  taliesin how long have you been down here this place is great this is great  matt well thank you at this point the fourth one comes down from a ladder off on the right side 
none	  chamber oh is the order getting oh its a whole party over here is that another firbolg  comes down and the others like yeah theres one over here the other pumats like im  impressed i like the color tones its a great arrangement visual perspective  taliesin impressed by what your mother went through at this point this is intense theres a  lot of you  matt the one with the goggles in the back goes sorry about that i should clarify these three  are arcanebased copies of myself we are all collectively pumat but 
none	 i am the original  taliesin well thats the best thing ive ever seen thats crazy thats just great id love to  learn how to do that  laura you shouldnt call them arcane copies they have their own personalities and their own  self you should appreciate them  matt one of the other ones speaks up and goes we absolutely take no offense because its true  laura well all right but i think each and every one of you is unique in your own way and you  should really appreciate it  matt the three 
town	 simulacrum all go aww at the same time  laura i go back to rearranging the shelf  taliesin its nice to see another firbolg out in the world doing something and you seem like  youre really building something great here this is spectacular  matt well i greatly appreciate that we put a lot of hard work into it and its hard to come  across folks like us that would appreciate something on this scale  taliesin you might know is there anything i absolutely should see while im in town this is  the farthest ive 
none	 been from home im curious if theres anything in this city that a firbolg out  taking a look around should  matt well unless i am mistaken from my previous memory of times outside of zadash whens  the last time you had a good bath  taliesin well i had a hot spring which was nice i mean it had some sulfur content and there  were some minerals in there that were probably a bit iffy  liam the baths here are quite lovely  matt this one knows what hes talking about listen to him follow 
none	 that around  marisha what are we talking about  matt oh sorry did you come here to do business  marisha yeah  matt prime goes all right then nice to meet you  taliesin caduceus clay pleasure  matt caduceus clay pumat sol pleasure  taliesin look forward to doing business with yous  matt of course you got gold weve got things to purchase anyway other pumats take care of  these folks ive got to get back to work good to see you all again  laura bye prime  matt he exits to the back 
none	 room the two other pumats step back and watch and theyre both  looking at you with this kind of  taliesin he seems like a decent boss that seems nice  matt not too bad people say you want to be your own boss well  laughter  taliesin thats really good  liam it feels weird to interrupt whatever this is  marisha im hungry so  matt unfortunately we dont really sell much in the realm of food items  liam i am in the market for some things of arcane nature oh i see youre reading 
none	 a book what are  you reading  marisha ugh god no more small talk you still have those bracers  matt we do actually to be perfectly honest you mostly cleaned us out last time you were in  here but weve got a few more items in here  marisha yeah whats up with those bracers  matt we got the bracers here if thats what youre looking for  marisha have they come down in price  matt no  marisha theyve been sitting on a shelf for six weeks  matt yeah  marisha so you 
none	 know  matt and six weeks later youre coming in and asking about them still  laura he does have a point there  marisha you know what jester  matt but yeah price is still 1200 gold pieces  marisha all right what do they do again can you explain one more time  matt these bracers enchanted by our fantastic boss pumat sol allow the bearer as long as  theyre not wearing any physical armor to impede the enchantment andor a shield on their body  helps protect them by deflecting incoming blows and giving them a 
none	 better sense of avoiding  physical atrocity onto their person  laura its like they were specially made for you beau you have to buy them i think you should  charge her more  marisha what whose side are you on here  laura i feel like youre a very specialized sort of buyer is all  marisha right so if anything he should give me a bargain  laura oh you should give her a deal  matt how about we meet in the middle and we stick with the price provided  taliesin seems fair  marisha 
none	 you threw him off jester  laura im sorry i got confused  liam terrible wingwoman  marisha look we might be purchasing a few things so why dont we wait and see what all ends  up on the counter and then well come back  matt all right well put this here waiting for you right there  marisha can i look at it can i touch it  matt yeah you can look at it but you dont own it  liam herr pumat i am considering spending about a thousand gold here and id be more 
none	 likely  to do so if maybe you could give us a better price for these things here  matt that can be considered depending on how much of a purchase youre looking to make what  are you looking for  liam well i need  laughter  matt dont think ive forgotten that silly string  liam i need quite a bit of your finest paper and ink i have a dearth of scroll a dearth a  mighty dearth  marisha girth  liam thats a different conversation danke i need about roughly 500 or 600 golds 
none	 worth of your  finest paper and ink  laura caleb save 300 gold because we need diamonds  taliesin oh im going to be buying some diamonds i wouldnt worry about that  matt if thats the case if you dont mind waiting pumat iii could you go to our storage  facility and get some more of that wizard paper and ink it looks like hes buying out our stock  here at the moment yeah not a worry ill be back here in the better part of 30 or 40 minutes  if you dont mind being 
none	 patient that one pumat takes a little cloak and throws it over his  shoulders see you guys in a little bit and exits outside  liam theres still one left  matt theres three in the room left behind one of them had drifted off to the side for a bit but  seems to be still listening in so you still have the one thats dealing with you  liam i also need incense fine incense about 60 gold worth if you have that much on hand  matt we dont have a whole lot of incense here 
none	 i can probably provide about 20 gold worth of  incense but there are incense makers within zadash that im sure can probably help you out  with the rest of it  liam so just not here  laura i remember you asking him for incense before from him i think  liam yeah i used it its all gone just like my cat  matt we can definitely look to ordering more incense if you foresee this being a consistent  thing we normally dont get that much of a request for it  liam obviously this is 
none	 a bit of a regular thing if you know the exchange rate is good i dont  need more than the 20 golds worth of incense today if you can order more were going to stay  put for a little while ja  marisha yeah  laura maybe  marisha whats the turnaround what  liam ill ask you later also oh dear i need that and i need that oh yes i was hoping to  look through your selection of spells you have yourself nothing too majestic but i have a short list  matt feel free 
none	 to ask and ill go ahead and he grabs this small wood front wood back with  leather edging binding ledger or catalog that he pulls out and opens it up yeah let me know what  youre looking for ill tell you if we got one in stock  liam if you could flip to the transmutation  matt takes a little set of glasses and puts them on the edge of his nose all right  liam im looking for one that can help if your friends are falling and you dont want them to  fall so 
none	 hard  matt feather fall we got that sure  liam okay i get hurt very easily and i need something to help me get out of dodge a little bit  quicker  matt all right theres a few options there for lower level enchantments we got an expeditious  retreat spell thatll help get you out of the thick of things  liam thats a winner  matt all right thats putting that down as well as a possibility those prices here because  theyre both relatively simple spells so ill put them at about 100 gold apiece 
none	 thats 200 gold  total for those two spells  liam and do you have something that can say catapult things around the room  laura i can do that for you  marisha yeah me too  liam but i also want to be able to do it  matt yeah well here lets see in the realm of what youre looking to accomplish here  laura i pick up something and throw it across the room  liam im not paying for that  travis thats some odyssey of the mind stuff right there  marisha i agree 
none	 with jester here  matt so youre going directly not messing around just a straight catapult  marisha thats so 1994 of you  travis straight up catapult  liam ja straight up catapult is that what its called ill take that as well  talisen are you going to sell him a tiny catapult that he has to assemble himself  matt its a straight up catapult catapult yeah we do have that as well that is 300 gold  for the batch of three any more spells youre inquiring about  liam no there are so many but 
none	 i am of a limited budget ill think about it if you can help my  friend beauregard with a good price on those  laura i also might want to buy weapons if you have a weapon that is also really cool and stuff  matt here ill show you what weve been able to accomplish since your absence weaponwise this  wasnt enchanted more than it was something that came into our purview from somebody that was  looking hard for some cash and we offered them a bit of an exchange as it was promising and  
none	 intriguing he pulls out this longsword but beyond the hilt the blade is snapped and gone  its a broken longsword its got a silver hilt and a silver pommel wrapped in red leathers around  the handle and there is a very fine filigree across the hilt and around the base this silver  loop on the bottom of the pommel but its a broken sword  laura are we going to get it fixed or can i still stab people with the broken part  matt youve got about an inch of blade there and it looks like 
none	 its still sharp in places if you  get real close you can probably make someone have a really bad day  laura what does it do  matt well looking it over it looks like there was some sort of enchantment embedded in it but  since the blade has been broken theres not it looks to be very old looks like it probably was a  relic from pre he goes and looks at his notes real fast yeah this would be predivergence  from the age of arcanum the reason we took it is the historical significance 
none	 we could probably  fetch a pretty penny should we take it to the various lyceums the academy would probably be  real interested but if you want to take it off for sentimental value or go get it repaired some  time its 300 gold  laura well i mean ill look at it i dont know its pretty brokenlooking  travis strained buy it  matt prime finished up some of this dust here and he pulls out a small sack that looks to be a  redbrown dust he says hes proud of this one im going 
none	 to be real honest with you if its  sprinkled over any edible substance it greatly improves the flavor to the point where its  downright distracting its the dust of deliciousness  laura oh my goodness  taliesin thats so exciting  laura thats a very exciting thing oh thats expensive seems like something you could hold  taliesin ill take that  matt last thing weve got here and then were pretty much out at the moment you guys have  become our number one customers which is really appreciated just finished this cloak last week  here 
none	 he steps around the edge and you can see while as well decorated as the place is its  pretty bare now you guys have come through and grabbed the necessary bits and what else was in  there has been picked up as well you guys arent the only people who shop here but youve been the  most recent intense customers he pulls this fine bluish purpletint cloak material that as it  flows as he lifts it up from behind the small locked box it ever so faintly gives off this  shimmer this is designed to 
none	 obfuscate the movements of the person who wears it to where it  makes him a little more difficult to pay attention the enchantments here and he looks  back and you can see it right along the hood of it theres these faint little runes he goes  this is some these are sylvan i dont know if any of you read more the classics  taliesin i read sylvan and there you are  matt well there you go this is specifically a cloak with an elven enchantment designed to help  make things difficult to see so 
town	 theres that one as well  taliesin yep lets take a look at that  matt thats all we got  laura and taliesin ooh  laura thats pretty cool  liam how much is that running for  taliesin 450  laura question  matt yeah an answer  laura is there anywhere else around town i could get an enchanted weapon of some sort  matt unfortunately enchanted weaponry is a very specialized  laura but everybody else has really cool weapons and i just have an axe  matt oh im sorry about that if you want 
none	 to commission an axe we can start working on  enchanting one for you  laura how much would that cost  matt well it depends on what sort of enchantment youre looking for if you just  laura something that makes me really cool  matt okay  laura that would make me hit really hard and probably open wounds that dont close ever and  maybe poison people and also turn them into candy  matt the other pumat is now looking over from the other room and going like hes like well have  to talk to 
none	 prime about that prime comes out yeah hes like she wants to see if you could  enchant an axe that hits really hard and is really cool and wounds dont close and  laura yeah you know really bad wounds also it really hurts a lot and it makes people turn pink  and also it makes people like start dancing and stuff  matt you watch as pumat prime is actually in his head doing math i could probably manage  something like that i got about an eightmonth window for completion and it would probably run  
none	 you about between ten to twelve thousand gold  liam continually coughs  travis you havent come this far  laura seems like a really reasonable price for all those things  matt oh i can guarantee it wont find anything better than that for a specified number of  enchantments this side of rexxentrum  laura what about just one of those enchantments what about it just makes people start dancing  taliesin axe dance  matt so you want a weapon that when it hits somebody they start dancing  laura they go yeah and they cant stop 
none	 its like it would be really hard for them to stop  matt all right so the only enchantment youre requiring is the possible ability of making  something dance uncontrollably  laura oh my god that would be so cool  matt all right  marisha i really liked the candy thing by the way  laura i feel like that would be harder  marisha maybe they can just decorate it to look like candy  laura maybe i could decorate it to look like candy  marisha oh craft night  liam sad youre not here

town	 familiar sniffs yeah and so much like toucan sam you follow your nose  taliesin it always knows  matt to grace of the wilds and there you see a female woman 50s with kind of wild big black  curly hair whos just sitting there nobody else is paying mind to the front little tent that she  has set up that is attached to what appears to be the rest of her shop which is mostly  closedoff and dark as you approach she glances over and goes hah hi can i help you what do  you

town	 too and im happy to and then in kind of  crappy handwriting underneath all the various prices of the herbs and things that are provided  you now see training shes added it to her list of things that she does as talking to you  taliesin youre probably the person to ask if theres a good tea shop in town i feel like youd  probably know where to get a nice caffeinated beverage  matt oh oh yes oh yes oh yes i can help with the tea the tea i can help  with so training 
none	 what do you want to train in please tell me  taliesin ive been hoping to learn how to make healing potions actually in general just start  to kind of break in that uh  matt okay okay okay that can be done it may take some time little bit of time give me your  time well make it work  travis laughing oh my god shes got a caffeine fucking iv under the desk holy shit  matt the herbalism kit for this is its five you already have one  taliesin i have an herbalism kit 
none	 i just want to do i need a special proficiency or get the  ingredients to help make one i do have the herbalism kit  matt yeah you would be purchasing proficiencies the training is what you would be doing this  would be the bulk of your downtime because it will take a while for you to really get  taliesin i only had a couple other light things i was going to do anyway  matt but the full training for this will come to about ill say 200 gold  taliesin i can do that  
none	 matt and you are now proficient in the herbalism kit  taliesin actually i was already proficient in the herbalism kit i was just specifically looking  for the stuff to make the potions  matt oh i misunderstood oh  taliesin no i got that already ive never back when i did this they didnt have all this  craziness  matt ive got you well if thats the case buying the materials youre essentially buying  them at halfprice you can make healing potions but you get to make them at 25 gold apiece as  opposed to 
none	 50  taliesin sure ill get lets get 150 gold worth of that and then probably some cooking  spices too  matt okay yeah cooking spices will run you a gold for the full set  taliesin oh so its 151 anything else of interest or otherwise maybe some good beverages  or otherwise there  matt you can find a whole bevy of beverages all throughout the pentamarket  taliesin yeah ill find other stuff otherwise other than that ive got diamonds and some im  looking for some general store kind of stuff  matt okay so 
none	 at 150 gold counting thats six healing potions that you have the materials to  make but you can spend your downtime during this week to make a few if youd like  taliesin yeah  matt thatll put you at about one potion per day of creation so you can easily take this time to  make all six  taliesin oh easily  matt theyre baseline healing potions level one but you should be able to do so cool and you  made a friend with jasna bree  taliesin wow thats a lot  matt shes a

town	 have it its probably over at suvos secrets  laura and sam suvos secrets  matt suvos secrets and they point you over to this large gray shop tent that has an ominous  feel when you look at it as bright a day as it is its like the addams family house in the  pentamarket it looks it looks unwelcome  travis on halloween all the kids are outside  matt yeah its a very drab very coarse material that the tent is made out of outside it looks  like the ropes that are affixing it down 
town	 are rotted a bit and you can see that some of the  ropes are starting to pull and tear on the edges it looks closed except for theres where the  flaps come together in the middle it doesnt look like anything that you should buy from  laura lets go in there  taliesin im very excited it looks great  matt all right as you enter suvos secrets laughing youre hitting the tent front youre  not walking in  laura no were seeing if its open  matt yeah its open its an entrance you go 
none	 inside and the interior its maybe 20 feet by 20  feet its not a very large interior space and it looks like there are some tables set up on the far  ends perimeter to the outside of it and on the back there is a very very large custom rocking  chair that is just like creaking and sitting in it you see an older very intenselooking  female dragonborn bronzescaled but in the age theyre starting to turn a bit green at the edges  kind of patinaed a little she sits there in the rocking chair 
none	 hands kind of crossed on the chest  just rocking and looking at you as you enter  taliesin its a nice place you got here  matt thank you very much welcome to suvos secrets  laura are you suvo  matt yes who are you  laura i am jester  matt jester what are you looking for that i might be helping you with  taliesin and laura secrets  laura and diamonds probably  taliesin oh and what else it was diamonds diamonds and secrets secret diamonds  matt she leans forward and her hands hit 
town	 the front of her knees leaning back she looks very  small but once she steps into the little bit of light thats coming through the front of the tent  suvos a fairly large dragonborn and even just leaning forward sitting is almost as tall as you  are jester  laura whoa  matt diamonds you say  laura yes  matt how many diamonds are you looking for  laura how many do you have  matt maybe 12  taliesin thats a lot of diamonds  laura that sounds like a lot of diamonds are they 
none	 big diamonds or little diamonds i dont know  matt she reaches back and theres this large it looks just like a sack just a general sack and  she reaches and grabs the edge and scoots it over without breaking eye contact it scrapes across  the ground and you hear things clattering around inside like shes carrying a large pouch of  various pots and pans she reaches in still looking at you one  laura oh caleb should be here right now  matt two and eventually counts out 12 varyingsized diamonds they all look some are 
none	  cut it looks like one of them is a little rough and just hasnt been cut by a jeweler yet but  sure enough theyre  laura we can tell theyre really diamonds  matt make a perception check  liam your laura is showing  laura well just making sure shes not ripping us off  taliesin ill join you in this perception check  laura okay ooh thats good perception 20  taliesin 14  laura ive seen a lot of diamonds in my day  matt you have youve seen some fine jewelry especially from your 
none	 mothers chests  travis yeah her chests sorry  laura theres lots of diamonds right in here  matt laughing its the tassels  laughter  taliesin so many carats so many carats  matt whoosh whoosh whoosh its sharp and dangerous  taliesin ow ow ow  liam singing best lay ever  taliesin ahh ahh im cut im cut  laughter  sam children were all children  matt yeah we are  liam thats why were here  matt exactly  liam this is serious  matt these are all legitimate diamonds with varying degrees of worth 
none	 but looking at the  batch theres probably about 700 well say rounded off about roughly 750 gold worth of  diamonds of the group that she set  taliesin 600 about 600 will do both of us  laura yeah so well buy all but you know these two little ones because those probably add  up to about 150  matt that is all right they will still be here when you come back  laura okay  matt drops them into the satchel pushes it away creaking thumping  laura ill do 300 and you do 300 
none	  taliesin yeah that works for me  matt so you each have 300 gold worth of diamonds on you  laura okie dokie oh is there anything else in here because this seems like a really cool shop  is there anything else that i want  matt there are many things  sam whispering secrets  matt grabs and pulls the sack back over  laura does she just have the sack the one bag in the shop  matt yeah the tables are all empty  laura laughing thats so cool  matt there is just a 
none	 sack where she keeps all of the goods  taliesin all of her secrets oh i get it now thats great  matt reaches in and pulls out what looks to be a mummified creatures hand you cant its not  quite humanoid its got fur on it sets it down this is a treated owlbear matron hand  taliesin i dont know what that is but thats really cool  laura wow  matt 25 gold its a good keepsake  laura okay  matt reaches in pulls out a big batch of garlic just a big old batch 
none	 of garlic in a small netted  sack she goes garlic good for cooking and also for keeping away vampyr  laughter  laura you know what we could do get the garlic sprinkle the dust of deliciousness on the garlic  and feed it to the vampyr  taliesin then theyd be in pain and very susceptible to  matt make a religion check jester  laura would i know this stuff a natural one  matt this plan sounds perfectly sound  laughter  taliesin i want to see what else is in the sack before we shouldnt 
none	 negotiate until we know  everything  laura yeah this is true  matt so for the sake of brevity  taliesin for the sake of brevity  matt its a whole slew of strange knickknacks  laura and we sit there while she pulls out the entire bag  matt yeah it takes the better part of 30 or 40 minutes or so theres an iron mask where the  mouth should be its just these two metal tusks that stick out almost like a castiron orc mask  marisha whispering russell crowe  laughter  travis are you 
none	 not entertained  matt oh my god there are theres half of a chess set carved from jade when i say half i  mean not like one side or the other half of each side so its completely useless there is a  single vial that has a familiar red medicinal liquid in it it looks like there is a healing  potion should you be so inclined to purchase it and the rest of it is just absolute junk  taliesin ill take the garlic  matt very well two gold which is really expensive for fucking garlic 
none	  taliesin im thinking thats one gold  matt make a persuasion check  sam one gold  travis yeah  sam hardcore negotiations  taliesin ah 20  matt it is yours  sam whispering secrets  marisha thats still overpriced for garlic  matt its so overpriced for garlic  laura how much is the healing potion  taliesin its good garlic never can pay too yeah its really nice garlic  liam heirloom artisinal  matt it is actually pretty artisanal garlic  taliesin artisanal garlic  travis it came out of the ground  matt all 
none	 right so yeah this would be a greater healing potion  sam ooh  laura oh thats expensive  travis maybe not from her  taliesin ask  marisha she just charged two gold for garlic  matt no for this shes like this will run 250 gold pieces but it will keep you from dying in  places where you will probably most likely be dying  laura wow i would take it but i dont have enough gold  matt pulls it back and puts it back in the satchel then you will not have it  laura 
none	 okay  taliesin im going to hold out the garlic one more time just checking seems legit  matt laughing she seems to nod like well done  laura oh i did that wrong  sam yes you did  laura it was because i was listening to what he was saying i was distracted there we go okay  matt no mask  laura how much for the mask  taliesin you dont know where thats been  laura i know  matt five gold  laura ah ooh three gold  matt make a persuasion check  laura 
none	 no er seven  matt five gold  laura deal  matt be careful they say the curse lasts for whoever i dont remember the rest of it its  just a mask theres no enchantment its just a very scary mask but congratulations its yours  travis just bailed  laughter  marisha its all bullshit  matt its all bullshit well most of its bullshit from this individual  laura okay  matt very well is that the end of it  laura i think so  taliesin i feel very satisfied with this entire expedition  matt 
none	 be safe and come back again i am very interested to sell to you what else might come my way  laura thank you suvos  liam whispering shallots chives  matt you step out the bright light of the midday sun the clouds of the previous storm have parted  a bit and theres actually bright light and your eyes have to adjust youre like aah ah ah  taliesin im perfectly satisfied with my shopping experience  laura im done with my shopping all of my money is gone  matt all right who else weve done a 
none	 few things with you guys weve done notts stuff fjord  anything you want to do  travis sure yeah the previous events have rocked fjord a little bit are there any bars or  taverns in zadash that may house frequent sailors or people of trade merchants  matt sailors not so much the empire is landlocked aside from the very far north and  those waters are in the frigid depths its a lot of ice floes and treacherous water up there so  there is very little passage up north the menagerie coast as you know is 
none	 where all of the  port towns are and thats the relationship between the empire and the menagerie coast that  agreement is based on the fact that essentially the menagerie coast holds all the longterm  imports and exports in the palm of their hand  travis i know that ive made that trip how far is it from zadash back to the northernmost part of  the menagerie coast  matt that would be nicodranas nicodranas from zadash its a little over a week to get there  id say  travis sighs i think fjords going to 
none	 take a steed and start heading south by himself  marisha oh shit  sam what hes going on walkabout  marisha hes going on a walkabout  travis while he heads south id like to adopt various disguises as i stop in inns taverns  places of trade and carefully hear if anyone is mentioning the name sabian if people are  talking about ships and try and casually make my way further south knowing that i have an amount  of time to get back north id like to try to make my way down and see what 
none	 i can hear and find out  matt okay make three successive investigation checks for me please  travis okay 12 nine and a six  matt you make it as far south as trostenwald before the frustration wells up inside you its  been a series of dead ends youve asked around and listened and anyone who wouldve crossed  paths with some of the shipping lanes that youre familiar with and that sabian was familiar with  none of them are passing this far north you assume that to continue this you would have to go  to 
none	 the menagerie coast and that would involve a thorough passage through nicodranas and the  various wharf taverns and seeing what old connections you might be able to dredge up in that  time but thats going to take you a little while  travis yeah i think ill make it to the end of that week and start to make my way back  matt by the end of the week youll get not quite to nicodranas if you want to you can traverse  the wuyun gorge pass through the wuyun gates and head into the menagerie coast 
town	 you will be alone  and it isnt a notdangerous road so just be aware there are some possibilities  travis no i know now that the strength is in the numbers of the group ill stop and head back  matt you sure  travis yeah  matt okay after this unfortunately notfruitful travel south in seeking out any possible word of  sabian you shift your attention back and decide to rally with your allies perhaps thats the  direction you want to go in the future okay what else would you like to do  travis thats 
tavern	 about it  matt okay very well anybody else  liam yeah if that invitation was good and i have about as she said the next day calebs going to  pull an allnighter im going to spend time in a hotel room an inn and take the lucky rock and  im going to fill it with transmutative power and make a transmuters stone out of it and for now  we will have it let me see in the dark for now i would also transcribe every spell that was in the  book and every scroll that 
none	 i have found so that i use up all the paper that i have purchased have  every spell and frumpkin is back as a cat  matt all righty cat frumpkin has returned  liam there is only one frumpkin i stayed up all night doing all of those things because theyre  very timeintensive and would have went to find beauregard very tired and ready to go to stay at  the library as long as i am able she said a number of days and when those days are up the  thing that i would do 
none	 is spend as much time that is left with the i would borrow jesters  haversack if she would let me and spend time with the dodecahedron  matt okay well get to that first you guys make your way to the archive and you enter there  and the following morning caleb is very  tiredlooking but also hard to tell  marisha sup man you ready for this monk retreat monk retreat  liam i want to learn all of the martial arts  marisha lets go  matt making your way into the archive its fairly bustling 
none	 in comparison to what you know  its either dead or theres a handful of people going through it today its a handful of people  going through youre like oh wow theres four people in here researching right now  marisha no one ever cares about books this much its weird  matt within a short time what are you looking to do beauregard  marisha i ask around and see if dairon is there  matt one of the monks goes let me go inquire ill be right back and wanders up the stairs  you see them 
none	 descend the stairs with another figure gray robes with blue lining hood pulled  back and there you see zeenoth  marisha oh  matt he steps down and goes beauregard i wasnt aware you had returned  marisha hi  matt hi dairon unfortunately is still out on the front lines  marisha what  matt well shes been sent to assess political threats beyond the eastern border been gone for  about 30 days and is said to return in the next 45 before we send anyone after her but im sure  shes fine  marisha she 
none	 said shed be back within a month that she was just checking out the front lines at  bladegarden  matt well things change when theyre at that moment of conflict  marisha you sent her behind enemy lines  matt no she progressed behind enemy lines and then wrote to us that she was staying for an  extended period shes impetuous i think you may know something about that anyway im sorry  dairon is not here what are you inquiring about  marisha just hoping to check in with her and catch up on some coaching  
none	 matt ah well there is tubo tubo is quite an accomplished monk of the cobalt soul and might be  able to help you whereas dairon could not  marisha do i know tubo  matt youve seen tubo youve not directly interacted because tubo much like dairon works  on a higher level you hadnt quite garnished the attention beyond just being that brat for a  while tubo is this very darkskinned halfling with very short widows peaktype hair and this  very calm smile about him very wellrespected but you havent really seen him move or do 
none	  anything other than walking through the archive and be present  marisha is he an expositor  matt you dont know  marisha hmm yeah all right  matt all right i shall return good seeing you again  marisha yeah you too  matt zeenoths patient smile fades as he turns within a short time you see coming from down the  same staircase tubo his arms folded in front of him as he descends and turns toward you so you  are beauregard correct  marisha thats me  matt and youre looking for training while your 
none	 expositor is away correct  marisha yeah i mean  matt follow me  marisha okay also i got this guy with me can he get a room and a library pass  matt zeenoth whos a little bit behind goes ill accompany him in his reading if thats all right  marisha zeenoth caleb caleb zeenoth  matt weve met in trostenwald  liam hallo  matt hello please lead the way to where youd wish to read  liam oh thank you thank you  marisha mmhmm  matt all right tubo brings you to a chamber you 
dung	 havent been in in a while which is the formal  training grounds beneath the archive there is a set of double doors in the far end that blend in  mostly with the dark wood that a lot of the bookcases are crafted out of it leads you down a set of  stairs into what is essentially a training pit with very heavily packed sand and dirt and there  are a number of wooden poles that emerge from beneath that have all sorts of skewed extensions  this is where a lot of forms are practiced and 
none	 a lot of defensive maneuvers are utilized you were  brought through in this area for training in waves time and again but its been a while since youve  been down here since youve been abroad and theres no other people there training currently  tubo brings you down very well show me what youve got for the sake of brevity  sam you die  matt yes roll up a new character tubo splatters you across the wall you spar for a bit showing  him the limits of your capabilities and hes deftly with a smile on 
none	 his face dodging  parrying you get a few good hits in and he backs away very good and then begins to overwhelm  you with his assault but never enough to inflict pain just enough to throw you off your guard  until a moment he turns around and puts his hands up into a cross once more and goes four days i  need four days with you  marisha okay and then what happens  matt and then your training for now is complete  marisha yeah all right  matt day one begins time to read 
none	  marisha what  matt he takes you back upstairs and begins to collect books and throw them into a pile and sits  you down  marisha i look at caleb across the library  matt you begin reading and its getting frustrated but as youre reading tubo begins to  lean in and say as youre reading think carefully about what youre trying to find what  youre trying to learn  marisha okay what am i trying to learn  matt what are you looking to research  marisha is there any type of history on families 
none	 of wildemount or any type of underground trade  going on family trees connections  matt for the portion of this day tubo begins to instruct you on how to not just read and research  but in focusing your spiritual energy on the specific things youre searching you begin to  find quick ways to johnny 5 through tomes to find what youre looking for with this comes your  ability to spend a ki point to gain advantage on an investigation check  marisha dope  matt day two comes around and he brings you down to the 
none	 subterranean chamber for more training  this time he begins to show you how to use that same internal spiritual energy or ki at the  moment of impact to give off this very localized wave of spiritual energy he begins to tell you  how this can break through defenses of things that are meant to not be touched with a mortal  hand this is intended as a way to bypass sometimes the mundane protections through this  training he teaches you how use your empowered strikes where now your physical fists and attacks  as a monk 
none	 are considered magical  marisha ghost puncher  matt yes you can now punch ghosts  marisha sick  matt day three he brings you down to the chamber with a chair and says sit  marisha okay  matt tell me tell me a secret  marisha is this truth or dare  matt kind of do you want to tell me a secret  marisha is there a dare option  matt no  marisha then its not truth or dare you know truth or dare right  matt he looks frustrated turns around does a little loop 
none	 comes back and as youre about to  speak up again he does a series of quick hits that hurt a little but that catch you right in  the clavicle the side of throat and then right under the chin as you pull back make a saving  throw for me please this would be a charisma saving throw i believe  marisha 12 not good  matt he begins to ask you questions about your youth and your family history things you dont  normally talk about with anybody outside of stopping yourself from speaking at all youre 
none	 on  the verge of constantly giving up the information he teaches you this is a technique that allows  you to pull the truth from those that would not be so forthcoming it is situationally very useful  and i will show this to you and so he teaches you the extort truth ability on the fourth and final  day he leads you down and begins to show you how to use your ki capabilities your spiritual  energy to blend it with moments of adrenaline bursts to give yourself a moment of reactionary  time where previously 
none	 you would have expended any capability of preparing yourself for an assault  as he puts you through hours of this rigorous training he goes very well the time to show  what you can do has come claps you watch as two other monks come down laughs but they have bows  and arrows and they have a third one they hand to him they all nock the arrows and aim them right  at you  sam tubo versus beau with bows  laughter  liam bobobobobobobo  marisha thats deeply accurate  matt yeah tubo goes fire 
none	 all three arrows come toward you thats a 19 to hit  marisha 19 just hits  matt okay thats another 19 actually and that is a 23 so all three hit you  travis jesus fuck your bracers  marisha groaning  travis i got new shit impacts  marisha im wonder woman im not wonder woman  matt the first arrow is ten points of damage  marisha can i do the thing  matt yes you can  marisha spend a ki point how many points of damage  matt ten  marisha ten no points of 
none	 damage  matt you catch one arrow  marisha wait im level six now right  matt correct  marisha one point of damage i lied  matt okay you take one point of damage you just barely catch it it manages to nick the side of  your shoulder  marisha okay  matt the two other arrows are coming at you as well  marisha i can only do this thing once though right or i can keep spending ki points to do  that right ill do it one more time  matt okay you can do 
none	 that now if you have another reaction  marisha thats right which i do  taliesin you have multiple reactions  marisha i do now  sam what  laura everybody be a monk  taliesin what  marisha if i spend a ki point one two  matt you dont have to spend a ki point to reduce the damage you spend a ki point to throw it back  marisha so i will spend an extra reaction then to catch the other one  matt you spend the same ki point roll for damage reduction on the next 
none	 one thats 12 points of  damage  marisha i rolled 11 so another one point of damage  matt you catch both arrows the third one is coming towards you  marisha and one more  matt spend another ki point thats two ki points now you get to roll to reduce the third one  marisha 12  matt yeah that one does no damage you catch one arrow out of the air it just barely nicks your  shoulder the other one you catch just as it scrapes past the side of your arm the third one 
none	  you catch in the middle of the air with no impact in the blink of an eye youve deflected all three  arrows shot at the same time  marisha i turn to tubo and i go did you see that  matt i did and with that your training is complete  marisha oh i dont get to kill those guys  matt no he hands the shortbow to the other one and they all head back upstairs  marisha sorry im sure youre really lovely people  matt impressive dairon was not wrong about you  marisha 
none	 wait what has dairons been talking about me what has she been saying  matt that you are an apt pupil now our time is done i have things to do and four days with you  has been more than enough  marisha yeah i get that a lot  matt he makes his way back up and escorts you out of the training chamber  sam guys hasnt the last four days been amazing  laura yes really peaceful actually  marisha i go find caleb and i go lets go  laura four days later  matt 
none	 so during this time caleb  liam if i had four days to peruse at will i would have spent the first day trying to research  anything i could find about xhorhas the xhorasians mentions of beacons of them living  many lives their religion if possible  matt make an investigation check with advantage to find all the right information  liam investigation that is 19  matt so on that specific thing you learn about the kryn dynasty which is the xhorhasian society  that exists in the ruins of ghor dranas you know that most of 
dung	 them were drow dark elf from what  youve heard and the ones youve interacted with now the drow were brethren alongside all elves in  the past history until their minds were corrupted and swayed by the terrible silver tongue of lolth  the spider queen one of the betrayer gods under her will they became deceptive cruel and  violent when the betrayer gods were defeated and banished during the calamity and the divergence  that separated the mortal realm from the gods that once threatened to destroy it entirely the drow  returned to their subterranean cities 
dung	 to rebuild their power far from the burning light of day  much of the recent studies into current drow society across exandria speak of growing paranoia  and madness thats seeping in with the believed influence of tharizdun the chained oblivion  whether it be by proximity of remnants of his power deep beneath the surface that have grown  close to these societies but there is whispers and research that say that some of these dark elf  societies are being driven slowly mad by this influence strangely what studies youve been  able to find that talk 
none	 about penetrating the kryn dynastys intense boundaries i fucking looked at  you immediately laura because i knew where it was going  laura you see you know it too that means you looked at me because you knew  matt of course as soon as i read the word i was like without fail  liam pray to the great god titty  matt we missed you but for those who were able to move past the boundaries to research more of  what little is known of the kryn dynasty there is little in iconography under lolth or 
none	 tharizdun  and what remains of that is ancient and crumbling and largely ignored by the society  liam do i find any mention of these beacons he mentioned beacons plural and reincarnation or  multiple lives  matt theres nothing about beacons nothing about reincarnation however it does speak of the  dynasty worshiping something other something that is new and dangerous as far as the cobalt soul is  concerned with what little research they have they refer to it as the luxon and seek to bring  all under its burning banner theyve rallied to the surface 
none	 of ghor dranas casting the skies in  eternal midnight that spreads with their dominion theyve begun taking the ravenous hordes of  beastmen and terrors of the xhorhasian wastes and indoctrinate them under this new false god  you also learn that a number of people mostly children of adolescent age have been found  abducted in the night by the kryn on occasion though the number has steeply grown this past  generation years after the first open conflicts with the kryn began the last thing you discover  is the leader of the dynasty is known as 
none	 empress leylas kryn she is called an umavi by them  though the words meaning is unknown by current research accounts of the empress speak of her as  a powerful and dangerous warrior on the battlefield and well over 600 years old or more  as records date back that far since she arrived in local history thats what youve discovered about  the kryn dynasty and xhorhas  liam i spend a day reading about that i will spend every remaining day reading about i was  rushed the first time i came here so im going to 
none	 spend every day left reading about the weave of  time and any mortals attempts to control it  matt make an investigation check  sam the weave of time  travis thats some restricted reading bullshit  liam 22  matt the things you discover from whats available to you in the archive time is a  constant the motion moving forward unyielding some powerful arcane influences can accelerate or  slow the rate at which time passes locally even stop it there are some stories from the age of  arcanum that speak of the greatest of sages 
none	 experimenting with reversing the forward momentum  of time and supposedly with some success but the process apparently was so taxing and the energies  required so extensive that it nearly killed those who passed through this natural flow thats as  much as you can pick up on the specific research involving that shift of time theyre more  footnotes and like a we dont mess with that because those who tried have mostly been  disintegrated or destroyed in the process  liam nearly killed does it talk about any of the people who were nearly killed but 
none	 werent  matt yes but they existed close to 1500 years ago  liam no record of their names  matt the names that were in there are none that correlate to anything youd recognize  liam i would still have spent the entire three days reading about that  matt ill send you those notes later you do pick up because of your very high roll there are  apparently some newer arcane experiments regarding time and reality being fielded within the soltryce  academy in rexxentrum a newer magical energy seems to have been discovered or rediscovered  
none	 that can seemingly adjust such properties with ease its being referred to as dunamis  liam dunamis  matt but other than that theres very little information because all that seems to be  proprietary within the academy  liam ja good cool super cool danke then im all done with all my shit  travis i forgot i shouldve looked at my list i had one or two other little things  matt okay fjord what else would you like to do  sam you didnt want to just walk for six days and walk back for six days 
none	  travis i was like i feel like i came up oh theres more shit  matt i was like are you sure thats all you want to do  travis yeah we can just say on the way back from those visits at night when i made camp i want to  summon the falchion and spend more time with it examine it specifically the eye if it has that  sort of in the letter it looked like there was a gash into the sphere itself does it represent  that is it smooth does it move  
none	 matt the eye where it sits in the hilt and it only sits on one side its not both sides that  contain the eye because there arent two pupils there is a singular eye that is embedded in it  that is looking out what would essentially be towards the left  travis is it near the crossguard or is it near the pommel  matt no its near the crossguard in the center of the hilt when you look at it it doesnt seem  to move or shift or pay any attention practicing the next few days 
none	 and trying some things out you  focus some of your arcane gifts towards an object casting witch bolt towards a nearby rock or low  dried and forgotten trunk of a tree at the moment the incantation begins the eye shifts to  look towards the target of the spell the spell explodes and you look back at the hilt and its  already reverted back to where it was before  travis super fast  matt but it did seem to react to when the spell was cast  travis creepy what the hell does that mean okay 
none	 when i get back could i make my way to the  gentleman for just a quick convo  matt sure all right so you make your way to the evening nip by the time youve returned its  been the better part of the twoweek period of time and you guys are also generally worried the  fact that fjord just vanished during this time period  laura he left while we were shopping  matt big surprise  taliesin travis is shouting  travis you guys are going to shop ah  matt poof sound  travis what 
none	 was it  marisha and travis spooky exit  matt you make your way to the subterranean basement of the evening nip the gentleman is not  currently present but upon asking around and you wait for about 20 minutes or so he does return  from the storage room to the side where you had previously been led down and through the  underworks as he comes in he sees you and sits on the other side of the table throwing his leg  over one side and sitting at a very comfortable and casual way across from you 
none	 fjord im being  told that youre looking for me  travis yes i appreciate you making some time for me this evening turns out we might be traveling a  little bit pretty soon were going to be making our way towards the wayfarers cove your  knowledge of areas outside of zadash seems so extensive what with the errands you sent us on i  was wondering could you share with me any knowledge you might have about criminal  underbellies any competitors you might have in business thats not of an official nature in  cities particularly 
none	 around nicodranas port damali the menagerie coast is your reach that far  matt i have some reaches in places yes thats quite a scope youre requesting i would say its  a good bet that most criminal elements you would encounter there are not at my network except for  a handful it might be more useful to you to know the ones to trust  travis thats where i was going with that  matt okay port damali you say  travis yeah its where im from  matt really  travis indeed  matt the jewel of 
none	 the coast ive been a number of times though its been years since ive been  able to leave my work here alone so if youre looking to expand your portfolio beyond zadash  that is commendable the one contact i could recommend in port damali would be father dwondaff pierce  travis father dwondaff pierce  matt dwarven fellow scraggly in the face dresses well he helms the pearl shrine a house  of worship to avandra the changebringer tell him that you bring many gifts  travis i bring many gifts  matt should you not work with 
none	 father pierce and his network be careful you could easily find  yourself on an opposing side to my business and i do not take kindly to betrayal  travis indeed i wouldnt dare after all you do have a little way of keeping track of where we are  and what we do  matt that i do  travis i appreciate your help in this matter hopefully we can be of some service to you down there  matt if something comes to mind ill send it your way  travis please do  matt and if anything 
tavern	 comes to mind that would be of interest to my ears business or otherwise  please keep me informed  travis you can be assured that i will thank you for your time ill leave you now  matt of course then he goes off to get a drink at the bar as you turn around right there at the  steps is cree the darkfurred tabaxi she approaches and goes im sorry to bother you i  noticed you descend here i have heard since your last arrival that there were losses in your journey  travis stuttering hm 
none	  matt i have had a number of uncomfortable dreams in the week and i cannot sense lucien  travis tell me about these dreams  matt make a persuasion check  travis oh god oh thats good 18  matt they are cold and sad i just see him alone and ive tried to focus he is not nearby  i have a very hollow feeling about this  travis whispering god why was i gone for six weeks okay normal volume yes unfortunately  your dreams may have some merit i myself was missing for most of our 
none	 journey and it seems  unfortunately that lucien befell a terrible fate  matt that was what i was fearing  travis im sorry to be the one to let you know if i was there i could give you more detail but i  found out much in the same way you are  matt that is all right thank you for your honesty it is hard for him to be gone for so  long then come back and so swiftly go again maybe i had put too much faith  travis you said he left before and 
none	 then came back if you dont mind my asking the last time  that he left do you remember the circumstances of his departure  matt we of the task takers we were undergoing a ritual that he had orchestrated with an ally of  his a woman of magical renown he said that this was something that was meant to lead us to this  city he promised a place where we could learn of a great many powers and secrets we believed him  he was very charismatic in his cruelty at times but he did not survive 
none	  travis and then you saw him here for the first time in quite a while yes  matt two years  travis two years two years are you and forgive me if this is too personal are you  expecting to see him again  matt i wasnt expecting to see him this last time i feel like whatever grace brought him back  to us maybe it was your carelessness that took him from us again  travis indeed maybe it was you have my apologies and my condolences  matt it is all right i have started 
dung	 a new life here and it has been serving me well  travis i hate to leave you with such sour news but i must be going  matt such are these days thank you for your candor she turns around and walks away  travis fuck then ill head back to the leaky tap  matt okay you guys have all gathered up at the leaky tap  sam everyones done their stuff  taliesin no i have not done mine  matt all right what do you want to do  taliesin mines very simple im going to 
town	 spend a little time every day im going to find the  nicest park in town im going to spend every day and im going to meditate and try and get some  guidance im trying to have another epiphany about what happens next im going to sit quietly  and meditate every day somewhere green or whatever passes for it in this city  matt roll a wisdom check for me  taliesin no that was a one  matt okay youve spent so much of your life in the tranquility of the cold and quiet  savalierwood and 
none	 even in the most naturebased portion of the city of zadash the general din and  chaos of the city is too distracting youre unable to reach that meditative state where youre  able to feel connected with nature and with the wildmother so meloras guidance does not come to  you you have to continue to throw your lot in with these strange folks that dragged you out of  your home  taliesin thats fair i guess the only no thats right were done i think we got  everything  sam yeah everyones done their thing  
none	 laura no i am not done  matt all right  laura well because i want to make the traveler like me again because obviously he doesnt and  thats why he didnt come save me im going to use these two weeks to scout out all of the  temples to the other gods and really see the guard schedules and the priest schedules and try to  sneak in ill probably enlist the help of nott here  sam ill help you  laura because youre good at sneaking  sam sure  taliesin well we do have 
none	 something we can  laura this is true  taliesin we got you something  laura before we do this this will be extra helpful for you  sam what is it i dont like this is it something is it made of dead people  laura just check it out  taliesin made of paper  sam its so nicely wrapped its so tiny  laura well imagine its a lot bigger than that  sam its tiny its just a small cube oh look it says to the bravest rouge weve ever met  from your friendly  
none	 laura it does say rouge doesnt it  sam no it says rogue im fucking with you from your friendly neighborhood healers you guys can  heal its a cloak wow it looks so cool and fancy  laura put it on i bet it changes size when you put it on because most magical things do  sam i will put it on and spend some time with it  matt okay youre able to attune to it and gain the benefits of a cloak of elvenkind  laura and then were going to go and try to sneak 
none	 in and really fuck up  matt well youll have to decide which ones youre going to do  laura how much time do we have what  sam how much do i owe you for this  laura you owe us nothing  travis its a gift  laura you have nothing  sam got tons of money way more than ill ever spend  matt there is the ravens den which sits near the ossuary gates  laura i already fucked with that one  matt all righty there is the hearth of the allhammer which youve messed 
none	 with as well a  little bit during the festival theres the valley archive of the cobalt soul while it is both an  archive it is also a temple to the knowing mistress there is the kings hall which is the  center of law and of course thats where the law master is youve spoken with a couple of times  thats where youve done your jobs off the taskboard  laura seems like theres a lot of guards there  matt yeah theres a lot of guards there theres the platinum house which is a temple to 
none	 the  platinum dragon that also exists in the interstead sprawl not too far from steams  respite which is the bathhouse  laura ooh yeah lets do that one because its close to the bathhouse  sam which one is that which god  laura and matt the platinum dragon  sam all right that seems right what are we going to do to it  matt theres also in the signet wall which is the military district there is the shrine of  the dawn which is to the dawnfather its up to you  laura well thats 
none	 just fitting isnt it no im going to do the platinum dragon because its  next to the bathhouse  matt okay platinum house it is  sam were trying to destroy this place  laura no  sam paint it  laura what does it look like  matt as you approach this beautiful but small white building is draped in deep blue tapestries  while a reflective mirrored sphere sits atop the roof during the day i think youve passed by and  seen it before when you were traversing the city are you going at day or 
none	 nighttime  laura were checking out during the day you know like were visitors  matt okay the inside is open archways and floor spaces theyre made available for worship but  also used for meditation there are a few folks in there that are quietly eyes closed taking in the  atmosphere of the interior theres areas for reading and theres areas for napping and  sleeping of the bahamut worshiping that goes on in places youve seen on the menagerie coast this  one is a little more new agey than youre used to about noonish when you 
none	 arrive there is a  sermon beginning where there is the herald of the house which is a silverscaled dragonborn in his  older years he looks very tired and as withered as a dragonborn can through their silver scales  hes in the process of giving this very deeply empowering speech about the majesty of bahamut  bestows upon us the knowledge and the grace in which we can be beacons of truth and justice in a  world that wishes to swallow all with chaos  laura snoring  laughter  matt but yeah the midday stakeout appears 
none	 to go well what do you wish to do  laura how often does he come back  matt hes there most of the day and in the evening he appears to go nap somewhere within the  platinum house  laura and then he gives his sermon during the next day and the next day we scout it out a  couple days in a row to really get the feel for the guards  matt okay make an investigation check  laura with advantage because notts helping me  matt sure sure  laura oh jesus h macy 
none	 nine nein  matt theres a couple entrances some hallways  laura wow  sam what do you want to do  laura im going to take some of the firecrackers we got from hupperdook and i want to set them off  during his sermon and then i want to but im going to invoke duplicity so it looks like im  actually still there listening to the sermon then while thats happening but im also disguise  self so i also want to look like somebody else while its happening so nobody can trace it back  to 
none	 me  sam that sounds complicated  laura this is really good stuff and then i want to run over to is there a big statue of the  platinum dragon  matt there is in the center yeah its not built on the floor its actually held aloft in the  central domed archway right beneath where that glowing dome at the top is at nighttime as  youve seen it it emits this faint white glow and is this beacon in the middle of the darkened  city aside from the various bits of torchlight that hit the 
none	 streets beneath this dome you see  the large carved looks like a pure platinum but its probably a polished silver statue of  the dragon wings outstretched looking down over the chambers and hovers about 15 feet off the  ground where all the rest of the folks gather for this sermon andor sit there to meditate and pray  and worship  laura this is a really bad time to do this because theres lots of people around can i do  it at night is there less people at night would i have learned at least that 
none	 much  matt yeah at night there are less people  laura okay i come back a second time after setting up the fireworks now the next time  sam were here again  laura we have to do it right this time im coming prepared with my paints and a mustache  travis your anarchists cookbook  laura my anarchists cookbook a couple brochures for the traveler and i steal cads straw hat that  he bought sorry and yeah were going to make the platinum dragon look like a really cool  farmer  sam all right okay 
none	 so were going to mess with the statue  laura yeah thats what i do is it stupid or something  sam what if someone comes in we kill everyone in the place  laura no if somebody comes in you need to distract them okay dont let anybody see me  because this might take a while  sam so im the distraction and the lookout  laura youre the distraction i also invoke duplicity to where it looks like im still there  on the outside and i can also be hanging out with you so you dont 
none	 look like a random person  matt what do you disguise yourself to be  laura the old woman that was in the other yeah  matt you guys approach in the evening together are you disguising yourself as well  laura ooh no you know what i should disguise myself as the sermon guy yeah  matt okay jester now taking the elderly form of a silverscaled very wellrespected herald of  the house kumas you approach the temple a few hours after sundown to where the interest in  worship tends to fade as folks go back to

none	 are of the temple  there are four that are here meditation one looks like a young man looking like he might be  on hard times and has tear marks on his face where he may have been looking up to the statue and  revelling the four people that were attending see you and oh and they get up and start gathering  their things the two that work at the temple are confused look at each other and look at you and  begin to walk towards you  sam are they carrying weapons of any sort 
none	 or vestments or jewels  matt no theyre wearing tabards that are mostly a silverwhite color with the symbol of bahamut  the blue with the silver dragon theyre simply dressed theyre the caretakers of the temple  lowlevel priests of the platinum dragon as they approach one of them looks to be a mid30s human  male malepattern baldness taking a large portion of his shorter blond hair the other one appears  to be a halfelven man as well he looks younger but looks can be deceiving with halfelves they  both approach with a somewhat concerned look

none	  halfelf still seems dubious your grace you seem to be rather weary perhaps i should stay and  make sure you need help  laura i need some quiet time  matt ill be quiet  laura no no coughs no  sam i think what his holiness is trying to convey is that he will be going on a spiritual journey  and theres only room on that train for one dude  laura scoot on out scoot it  matt of course your grace the halfelf leaves but his eyes dont deviate he appears to  leave 
none	 the room  sam that was perfect  laura that went really well right okay you stand right here  sam im going to watch the door they all went out the front door  matt theres open archways that lead down long hallways and they all appear to have left the  hallways  laura okay im going to invoke duplicity im going to make it look like hes kneeling down in  the doorway praying then im going to run up and i want to start painting up the platinum  dragon  matt okay so your invoke

none	 setup and make your way  up carefully one two leap and then grab onto the platinum dragon it hangs back and forth a  bit and you can now see what you cant see from far down is there are two sets of chains that hold  it aloft up in the temple it is free hanging and now youre rocking back and forth  laura ooh you know what i could just knock this down that could be really good too  sam that would be faster im going to hide in one of the pews  matt 
none	 make a stealth check  laura i start climbing up and i want to paint it rainbow colors i feel like that would be a really  nice addition for the platinum dragon  matt okay you begin painting rainbow colors and pulling out all your various pigments and the  platinum begins to give way to a technicolor vomit nightmare  laura with a mustache and a straw hat  matt as youre getting to the mustache you hear many many footfalls approaching and a voice  saying yeah just this way i  laura i drop down and 
none	 run  matt okay as hes in the middle of talking thud make an acrobatics check because its a  15foot drop  laura 21  matt wow okay a threepoint landing in the middle youre still  laura im still the dragon  matt but theres also the invoke duplicity of him there so theres one he goes thats the  thud what huh  laura shrieks and i run  matt they give chase they go after whoever that is there are now five crownsguard and two  members of the house giving chase down one of the 
dung	 hallways  laura was there an exit looking for an exit  matt make a perception check to look around you as this is happening rather rapidly  sam oh god im going to follow from behind stealthily  laura 23  matt as youre rushing down you look and theres two open doorways one of them appears to be a  dark interior the other appears to lead to some sort of candlelight the halls coming to an end  ahead of you right or left which way are you going  laura wait say that again  matt 
dung	 theres two open doorways one is dark on the inside the other seems to have candlelight  from the interior  laura dark  matt all right you duck into the dark room  laura this is like a choose your own adventure  matt yeah the footfalls are coming faster and faster behind you and nott youre noticing that  theyre drawing weapons and one of them appears to be pulling out some sort of a bead out of their  pocket thats all you notice  sam okay im going to scream as loud as i can from 
none	 behind them and scream oh my god hes dead  matt well they all immediately stop and look behind at you  laura how many are there  matt theres five crownsguard and then two members of the church  laura okay im hiding in the room  matt make a stealth check please  marisha at least four stars on grand theft auto  laura 19  matt you think you may be hidden they turn and look at you what  sam he stopped breathing hes back there didnt you see him  matt make a deception check 
none	  sam oh god thats a nine  laura oh no  matt as theyre all looking the one that had the bead goes throws it your direction  laura oh no dodge it  sam ill try  matt thats an 18 to hit  sam that hits  matt okay let me look this up again i wasnt expecting it to go this way  sam theres no save right  matt im going to doublecheck you make a dexterity saving throw  sam whew thank goodness im wearing my cloak so i get advantage thats a natural 
dung	 20  matt okay so you dont take any force damage however this sphere of translucent force has  completely encapsulated you  sam jester  matt and youre just slowly rolling back like rumbling  sam ah jester  matt two of the guards come over to flank it the other three continue their travel with the two  members of the church so theres five they then duck into the dark room where you are as one of  them lights a torch to light up the chamber now you quickly made your way through this is a 
none	  storage chamber and on the inside you can see theres a bunch of candles theres a bunch of  statues and things that are used in various ceremonies theres a number of wooden hanging  rods that they place a lot of vestments on that are not used theyre for more formal events  and celebrations and holidays you have put your way into a corner between one of these boxes and  some of the raiments in the hope that you wont be seen they are going to make a very thorough  investigation of the room  
none	 laura okay and when they come in the room  matt they begin to slowly look through one of the members of the church after the first 30  seconds of not finding anyone darts off so theres only four in the chamber hes going to  look elsewhere the crownsguard begin to peek through lifting up pieces of equipment lifting  up the tops of storage containers  laura how big is the room  matt the rooms about 15 by ten feet its not a very large room  laura oh bejeebies  sam by the way i 
none	 only have advantage on stealth not on saving throws  matt okay so roll again  sam so the first roll that i had rolled was a five which adds up to a 12  matt oh  sam so i will take damage  matt you do you take 5d4 points of force damage  laura 5d4  matt five seven eight you take 11 points of force damage  sam oh thank you thank you sir may i have another  matt so this is equivalent essentially to an otilukes resilient sphere youre in a hamster  ball 
none	 but the two guards that are right there are flanking it and holding it in place so you cant move  laura i cast blink on myself  matt okay as one of them turns and just manages to pull the raiments aside revealing your face  uh i found them whoosh wait no she was right he was right i spread out and they  all begin to scatter out into the hallways now  laura okay  matt you move  laura stealthily if i yeah because i can move like what ten feet with blink or can 
none	 i  travis you can reappear ten feet away its either ten or five  laura ive never used blink before  travis but you have to roll for it  matt correct so with blink at the start of your next turn you return within ten feet of where you  vanished  travis but youve got to roll 11 or higher for you to even blink out in the first place  matt so go ahead and roll  laura oh jeebies  travis you got it 11 or higher no problem  taliesin its fine  laura 
none	 eight  marisha oh no  laura goddamnit why did you have to say anything  matt no thank you keep her honest on that one  liam is the traveler happy with you yet  matt so your form flickers for a moments as the spell kicks in however you vanish spread out  youre right back in place wait and they go ahead  laura charm person  matt you cast charm person all right it  laura at 3rdlevel how many have i used  sam jesus youre using every spell you have  laura yes i

none	 are four in there  matt theres three crownsguard and one member of the house who do you attack  travis you can kill him  laura yeah the crownsguard  matt all right so they have advantage on this save because you are technically in opposition on  this one  laura okay  matt so the first crownsguard with advantage thats going to be a 14 whats the dc  laura 15  matt 15 he fails other one two sixes in a row fail the third one two and no they all fail  even with advantage 
none	  travis get the fuck out  marisha oh my god  matt so the three crownsguard come in and are like have you seen where this person went  apparently someones masquerading as you  laura been looking everywhere for him cant find him anywhere maybe check that room with the  candles on the other side of the hallway  matt well go check  sam and marisha that room with the candles  matt the three crownsguard turn around and rush off to find it while the member of the house the  halfelf from earlier is

none	 travis yeah theres no telling that theyre going to share any information with me anyway im fucking  absorbing things and shit just appears and im getting stronger by the day and it has nothing to  do with the things that im learning theres no books or knowledge its just happening what if  they look at me like you guys look at me sometimes what if they dont let me go maybe  thats not where i need to be  marisha how we look at you sometimes like youre awesome like were awestruck  travis like weird 
dung	 shit is happening  marisha thats accurate yeah i do look at you like that sometimes  liam and not very explained at all  travis its hard when youre the only one experiencing it its hard to relay  liam well what if you tried  travis im certainly open to that  liam how about right now  travis what do you want to know  liam is there any of this that you have not shared yet  travis no i dont believe so i did tell molly before we were taken about a crewmate of mine 
town	  named sabian he was the one that ambushed the ship that caused the explosion that threw me  overboard the one that probably sent vandren to his fate after i woke up on the shore afterwards  i found the sword and i wasnt quite sure where i was i found a road and managed to hitch a ride  back towards port damali and when i got there i went to vandrens storehouse and i planned to go  through his things i was more high up on the crew than sabian was but his place had been 
none	 ransacked  gone through torn through there was a local butcher next door that i walked into and he had  said that he was glad to see at least one other of us that no one else had returned i said who  was the other one he had said sabian so i feel like he somehow survived he knows what happened  why it happened i cant bear the thought of something happening to me because im pursuing  this and i summon the sword  matt you see as the blade now is this unique merger of 
none	 the falchion shape and size but now  holds this golden tint of the summers dance it curves towards the edge and has a slight pointed  jagged arch in the back that the scimitar had previously held but still contains the  barnacleencrusted pattern across the hilt and there in the center still is the central yellow  gleaming eye  travis i dont want to be focused on this i want to be focused on that plus i feel like if those  events led to this maybe theres a remedy for the whole thing  marisha so 
none	 you want to find sabian and hope that he has the answers  travis or just kill him thatd be fine but yeah maybe some answers first  marisha and youre sure this motherfucker was like sole sabotager  travis he and i have a long history but after he so we were in the storm he ran belowdecks  and he placed a bundle next to a lot of the crates that we were shipping that was unusual for him  so i followed him down and i saw him with a lantern in his hand and when he 
none	 turned he had lit  what looked like a fuse i called out he threw a few daggers at me they hit i went down he ran  past me just as i made my way back above decks i called his name and i saw him at the bow of the  ship and it looked like he was preparing to jump overboard which in a storm like that is insane  thats when the explosion hit it ripped into my back it threw me over and i remember going underwater  and seeing parts of the ship fall 
none	 and flames above the water i could see things  falling and some of it was cargo and some of it looked like me i just feel like he was prepared  to get the hell out of dodge  taliesin just so im clear as i really feel like im playing catch up hes the one responsible for  that er pearl that youve got in you  travis no my teacher and my captain vandren is the one i saw in this vision and he had the same  sphere i saw myself through his eyes and he 
none	 was holding the sphere and pushing it into his chest  he was also standing over a man i saw his reflection he seemed younger so i dont know  when it was but i didnt know that side of him he was an exacting man firm but fair and it  just leaves more questions than i have answers to  marisha i mean no offense or anything but these sound like some crazyass fucking sailors  liam you speak of a remedy how do you mean do you mean you would rid yourself of that blade  these 
none	 changes in you or am i not hitting it  travis i honestly dont know ive thought about what it was like before i had this ill make the  sword disappear life was simple but i dont feel like i had the ability to affect my surroundings  i was not a proponent of change its selfish but i feel like i can do things now i dont know if i  would get rid of it but i want to know what happened to him i owe him that much  liam oh good morning  laura ah 
none	 it was a long night what are you guys talking about  liam our next destination  marisha fjords angry marble in his chest  laura oh  travis yeah i was thinking that if you wouldnt be opposed we could go back to the menagerie  coast stop by your moms place in nicodranas  marisha oh  laura well i mean i would have to like disguise myself but yeah we could probably go there  marisha disguise yourself  laura well i cant go back home  marisha oh right  laura but if you want to 
none	 go to the menagerie coast you know im always on board for that  fjord but what about the academy  travis yeah i was telling them i feel like instruction isnt exactly what i need its not  going to get me anything yet i just feel like i need to take steps in the right direction does  that make sense feels like im stalling  taliesin also the deal with his little  travis yeah the letter does say the wayfarers cove and it says its supposed to be delivered by  the end of this month 
none	 so i feel like theres some urgency if were going to capitalize on  intercepting this  liam for what its worth fjord soltryce academy normally starts with younger students not  exclusively but generally  travis oh i hadnt realized what if you show up with inherent abilities  liam i dont know  marisha i mean you dont want to give sighs i think whatever gifts youve been given theyre  natural and progressive i mean figure that out on your own first you dont want to give them  back right  travis no certainly not yet 
none	 if it will help me find that fuck then id prefer to hold onto them  marisha theyre called gifts for a reason right itd be rude to give them back  travis i dont know how id give it back  taliesin i like that thats really good  laura maybe you have to poop it out  sam yeah like passing a stone  travis poop it out  laura it would really hurt but it could happen  sam could go through his peepee hole too  laura thats true  marisha kidney stones  laura you 
none	 never know maybe somebody else has already done what you did and they already pooped  it out and now its in you  travis then i ate the poop stone yep didnt wash it off or nothing  laura nope  travis it was underwater though so  laura thats true that is true thats probably why it was underwater  liam were all agreed then that fjord eats poop  travis canon  laughter  matt no thats what would have happened if it actually came out of your peehole  travis laughing i poop out my peehole 
none	  matt anyway  travis yep  laura menagerie coast then  marisha yeah  sam sure  travis i would hate to go without all of you  sam we stick together  liam after what we have been through in the last month itd seem foolish to split up now im  curious about the menagerie coast  marisha me too  laura gasps you guys could meet my mom  sam im excited  marisha i so want to meet your mom  travis just to be clear we can meet your mom but you cant  
none	 laura i can meet her i can see her  travis youre just not supposed to be seen coming back  laura exactly  travis got it  liam she would be okay with you  laura i will let her know to expect us  travis oh speaking of before you came down  sam were going to need you to send a message to yasha do you need to know where she is to send  that message  laura nope i just need to know its her  sam it might be good to let her know 
none	 where were going in case she wants to find us  laura okay i send a message to yasha hello yasha im really sorry that the last time we  left it was really hard for all of us but we wanted to let you know that we are probably  sam clicks  travis no destination  laura i send another message to yasha  sam the next day  laura no ive got three four 3rdlevel spots i think four because of my pearl so im  going to send another one sorry i got cut off earlier 
none	 anyway what i was saying is that we are  leaving zadash and were on our way out over the hills and were going to go to probably  sam clicks  laura anyway i get to it eventually  laughter  matt best use of sending ever  liam seven spell slots later  sam robotic voice you have seven new messages  laughter  liam as jester okay im starting at the top again  matt yashas somewhere just going like sighs all right have you guys decided to start making  your way to the menagerie coast 
none	  laura wait i got to get my handaxe first so i pick that up  matt yeah easy enough pumats there yeah we worked real hard on this one so i hope you enjoy  what weve imbued into this previouslynotveryinteresting weapon to make it  just a whole lot more interesting  laura it is so interesting now did you want to put a ribbon on it or something to make it  prettier  matt do you want to request a ribbon weve got multiple colors  laura gasps what colors  matt green and gold
