okay you already said that was i busy rolling dice and talking  matt you were but thank you laura good looking out i appreciate that so yeah i think thats  all the major news and given that lets go ahead and dive in to  tonights episode of critical role  dramatic music  matt hello and welcome back everybody so last time where we left off vox machina upon working  on their bakery the slayers cake in whitestone made a possible new hire who turned out to be a  drow bounty hunter named krynn /town/ who was sent here to acquire taryon darrington and bring him back  home to the city of deastok in wildmount you guys all through a series of highlevel magic scrying  and transportation managed to cut off this specific bounty hunter on the outskirts of the  city and in doing so made an agreement to not slay her where she stood and instead possibly  make a transaction down the road you guys then made your way into the city of deastok to the  darrington estate and were led up into the study of howaardt darrington father /none/ of taryon in which  you all discussed the reasons of why he was brought back the current financial state of the  family and the intent to resolve and remedy longstanding sins of the father through you  standing up and doing your family duty from his perspective we left off as you guys had just  finished that conversation youve exited his study and were about to go about your business coming  off the tension of the conversation you closed behind you with a clack the heavy wooden doors of  howaardts study there you have bertholt /none/ whos standing off to the side the dragonborn servant  of the darrington family waiting patiently and you all at this moment are at your own disposal what  do you wish to do  sam just before we move the names that dad had told us about to maybe parlay with in the myriad  laura korshad  sam korshad  matt korshad yes  travis and how much was the debt it was 260000  sam 230000  matt 230000 gold debt  sam but wait wasnt there some other name the little  travis lydia  matt /none/ lydia was who you are to be betrothed to and the location was the grumpy lily  marisha i was questioning myself i was like there was no way something  was called the grumpy lily  matt had a stroke while taking notes in dd grumpy lily  laura the many is who we want to speak to  taliesin just as something that happened during that whole family conversation i was scanning the  room and the bookshelves for anything interesting anything out of sorts anything out of place  matt make a retroactive perception check  sam /none/ a retroactive perception check  taliesin i didnt want to yeah i didnt see shit i just rolled a three thats nothing  matt rightly so  sam retrograde you know they always say that retrograde perception is 2020  matt what  taliesin i appreciate what you were going for there  sam anyway i would love to ask bertholt if he knows the location of my sister  matt well if you are looking for maryanne shes probably in her chambers  sam all right well i mean i guess we can all walk to her room and /dung/ knock on the door its a  little weird right  liam you want to go talk to her and touch base with her first  you can introduce us to her after  sam sure ill lead them back downstairs to that main room that was all awful and terrible right  matt well it was just dark and cold and empty  sam so ill lead them down there this was our playroom maybe you should just wait here and ill  go talk to sis ill be right back  laura all right  travis is there /dung/ like furniture to sit on or is it barren  matt no no theres furniture and a lot of the furniture here is really well made dark woods  fine deep red and maroon fabrics a lot of it has dust on it  taliesin plastic covers no plastic covers  matt no plastic covers but some of the furniture here is for use and some of it is here just  as part of the decor and its very easy to see which ones are which  laura im definitely going to sit on the ones that are just /none/ for decor  matt okay theyre really uncomfortable  laura cool going to rub my butt all over it  matt you leave a little buttprint in the dust perfect at which point bertholt acknowledges  that you guys will be staying could i get anything for you perhaps teas juice water  travis what is this bullshit no ale  laura do you have fermented juice  matt ill fetch the wine and he hobbles off to acquire some means of imbibement  travis should we pay him we just found out hes dead fucking broke  laura id /tavern/ rather not  travis okay  laughter  matt okay you make your way back to the second floor and off to the far western end of the  estate to what you recall being maryannes chambers so as you enter her room which has  become her own study as you recall last time seeing her her room was becoming more and more of a  functional office and as you knock and push the door open like a familiar brother does not  wishing for any patience on her end necessarily you can see the interiors the beds /none/ there for function  most if it is i wouldnt say a replica but it very much resembles the decor and mood of your fathers  study you see her currently sitting at a desk in the corner her blonde hair is tied back in a  tied braid that runs down her back she wears a coat and pants and seems to be dressed a little  formally or businesslike for being casually at home you havent really seen her dress like this  before at least not in a casual circumstance as you glance over past the doorway /none/ she looks up from  her papers and goes brother  sam hello sister  matt brother what she closes the book you can see shes been looking over ledgers and  catalogues looks like shes been doing a fair amount of work here at the desk and stands up in a  very formal way and begins to step towards you when have you arrived  sam just today father kidnapped me and brought me home  matt kidnapped  sam well im not a kid but still works abducted abducted me and brought me home paid  someone /none/ to do it  matt right  sam yes anyway its good to see you your room is coming along quite nicely it seems like youre  running the show now is that true  matt no not quite but the responsibilities have definitely been mounting you look well how  have the windtossed roads of exandria treated you this past year  sam well i have had many adventures and close calls but i wont bore you with those details  its been an interesting year abroad and i would say im glad to be back but for the /none/ abduction  part and also the fact that ive now learned  that we are destitute is that true  matt were on the path to destitution yes  sam so its true he wasnt just trying to guilt me  matt probably both to be honest were in a relatively dire situation compared to our previous  longstanding lifestyle choices were trying to fix this mess  sam and what would have been your plan had i not arrived today  matt well you were part of the plan were trying to figure this out the best we can /none/ and  given the circumstances we feel this is probably one of the most viable and least dangerous or risky  endeavors in which we can right the familys trajectory  sam by marrying me to some lady ive never met  matt oh youre welcome to meet her ive met her i helped to arrange this  sam what is she like  matt shes very nice shes very pretty a bit bookish which once again would befit you rather  well but lets be honest this is a political marriage you do what you want i mean  /dung/ there isnt a politician or a lord of this land that hasnt in some way shape or form made their  own life outside of the family at that point you noticed she gets a bit dark and seems to speak  with this bit of sarcasm  sam and fathers businesses are they being run the same way with the same attention to detail  matt theres been no necessary change to the way business has been done other than the transition  of some responsibilities of course and she gives a slight nod shes getting a little  /none/ uncomfortable as this conversation continues  sam listen im sorry to pop in like this and challenge your judgment but me marrying this  person would solve our problems longterm somehow  matt marrying into this family the truscan lot would enable us the resources and connections to  reacquire the deeds to our land to reacquire the business elements that weve been in this  unnecessary partnership with for some time and would enable us to once again reclaim complete  rulership of our familycontrolled lands  sam do we not own anything anymore  matt it is a /none/ partnership that is quickly sliding into the behest of the myriad  sam so what is ours now anything our personal belongings this home  matt we still own everything in partnership own solely on our own some of the furniture  sam and again if i do this whats to say were not just going to drive up another debt again  doesnt seem like father or you have been very good at keeping us in the black  matt i have only been recently brought into this unfortunate circumstance brother and you can  trust in knowing that /none/ in my studies and my time spent here working with father being very clear  and very thorough with the mistakes hes made in the past  i will not be doomed to repeat them  sam so you and he are two peas in a pod yes  matt well hes certainly in need of retiring based on the stress hes put upon himself it would  not be long until i will take over the responsibilities  sam well i may poke around and see if theres another way i could help but before i do is this /none/  fun for you do you like running this business or almost running it  matt its certainly a better challenge than many other daughters of lords  are given in their time  sam do you have any friends  matt friends come when the money and powers in place you know this  sam i do  matt its the way the land works  sam well ill leave you to your work and love the decorations im considering the offer and  ill have an answer for you by tomorrow morning  matt wonderful as you begin /none/ to make any sort of exit she catches you and goes brother  your arrival here is a great boon to us you have the power to change the fate of this family  consider the respect you have for the people who have worked their entire lives to provide for you  what you have been given mother and father  sacrificed so much for us consider weighing ones  selfish interest versus the importance of a bloodline that is all i ask  sam all right ill consider it with all my intellect  matt well its good /none/ to see you she steps forward and gives you a halfhug  its like  sam a pat the back pat good day  matt good day she straightens her coat and  sits back behind her desk  and waits for you to leave  sam all right ill shimmy out sighs all right ill rejoin my friends downstairs well  laura how did it go  liam well yourself  sam as expected things are about the same between me and maryanne  laura is she still a raging bitch  sam no shes not raging  ashley /none/ i just think its rather rude that she doesnt want to come down here and meet us  sam she has her work and her  liam oh shes not coming down  sam no  liam thats weird  sam i mean i dont know shes busy i guess  liam okay  sam theyre not guest people theyre not dinner party family  liam we picked up on that  laura not even for people who could help them with their name  marisha did you mention us or anything else  sam nope it didnt come up /none/  liam did they have any idea what a heavy hitter you are now the type of people you roll with  sam they said how have i been but they dont really give a shit either way  marisha so you didnt even offer up the information  sam if they are not interested in me why should i be interested in them knowing about me  laura thats a very good point  liam lets back it up what are you thinking wheres your head at how can we help you  sam i dont know what to /none/ do theres this woman shes apparently nice and i could go for it and  marry her and then it seems like all my family problems would be okay  ashley forever  marisha theres no such thing as family problems being okay for forever  travis really  sam i dont know im sort of curious about talking to the people who are in this contract with my  father and seeing if theres any way to wiggle out of it a little bit but i dont know how to solve  everything right now i also dont know /tavern/ i feel a duty a responsibility to this family because  they are my family  marisha grog  travis you feel a doodie the privy is over there or over there or the front yard beckons  taliesin he may have opened a bottle of wine  travis im lost for the rest of this conversation  laura no were not drunk we may have just had a  little bit of wine just a small amount  travis i carved my name into the floor  sam part of me wants to oh god part of me wants /none/ to turn around and go back with you to  whitestone and forget that the darringtons exist but i dont think i cant do that i am a  darrington and i owe it at least to my name to try and fix what i can  laura thats your plan  sam yes  laura dont sacrifice your entire life for this though  sam well ill try not to but it seems like a plan b at this point  liam also you had no prior knowledge to your familys connection to the mob  sam no its /none/ way cooler than i thought my family ever was i knew my dad did shady business with  lots of shady characters but i never knew i assumed he paid off people i assumed he had  friends in high places and people who youd have to bribe to turn the other cheek but i never knew  that he was in business with them owing our whole existence to these terrible people and i dont  know what to make of that  liam t i think were all prepared to help you do anything you want to do /none/ but are you sure you want  to help perpetuate the family business  sam definitely not listen i think theres two steps to this theres the short term and the long  term we have to solve this shortterm need really quickly not this whole 230000dollar i mean  gold debt its a whitestone term i mean a wildmount oh my god my phone rang im confused  anyway listen couple drinks before no we have a shortterm problem that we can maybe go  alleviate a bit if we go talk to these folk at the laughing ninny /none/ or whatever its called  the grumpy lily  liam i like the laughing ninny i kinda want to go there instead  taliesin its a standup comedy club  laughter  sam and then theres a longterm problem which ill have to solve on another day theres a long  term problem that my family is awful and needs to be stopped at all costs and thats something that  ill have to deal with tomorrow  laura do the truscans thats who you are being married into potentially do they have a son  taliesin that doesnt help /none/ thats almost beside the point  sam youre talking about marrying the sister yeah  taliesin oh thats still  laura i guess its not the same is it  taliesin no actually its unfortunately the opposite  sam youre royalty you know this  laura of course i know everything about royalty  sam little royal girl  marisha what exactly is your duty that you are feeling inclined towards damn it grog  taliesin lilah is it lilah  all lydia  taliesin perhaps we should talk to this lydia as well because she is obviously in a /none/ position of  being told what she is going to do with herself  marisha yeah maybe shes also a badass  liam at the very least we should meet all the chess pieces on the board right  sam i mean she lives in another part of the kingdom right matthew mercer  marisha thats not a problem  sam oh yes thats true but theres the intown people we can meet first  laura sure lets talk to the mob  sam yes of course youll come with me because i cant talk to the mob by myself /none/  laura tary of course we will  travis wait when you said we need to stop your family at all costs  are you talking about killing them  sam no im not talking about killing them  marisha yeah but grog does bring up a point that i was trying to make before he started laughing  when i said duty giggles but what are you committed to keeping your family around you said  you were compelled and you felt like you had a duty but then you immediately started talking about  taliesin stop it travis /dung/ god i cant  marisha tearing your family apart and stopping them  sam my family is pretty bad ive learned but ive also learned from young trickfoot that even a  rotten family is worth trying to save and i admire the path that she took with her family and  i would like to at least try to push mine in the right direction and try to make our name a little  less shitty  liam that is a pretty big matzo ball my friend  sam well thats why thats long term in the short term /none/ i just want to get them safe  marisha if theres one thing i understand its giving your life to a cause  sam i dont want to die if thats what youre saying  marisha no  sam dedicating  marisha dedicating  sam thank you  marisha time is a gift i would say  sam sure  marisha so dedicating that gift is its a big thing but i hope you believe in it  sam i dont believe in them but i believe in the cause right now  and well see how far that takes /tavern/ us  marisha we believe in you  sam you guys  travis can you describe to me this duty  marisha you dont care  travis i think i do now is it real hard  sam its a little more nebulous than that grog  taliesin we can pass on this for now  travis adjectives are not my strong suit so  laura you know what an adjective is thats impressive  travis yeah no i got it one time at this tavern i had it for two nights  it just itched everywhere  sam listen /none/ when you see my duty youll know  travis copy that  liam its loose this duty is loose  laura should we go to the grumpy lily then  taliesin please  laura this is going so well  matt as youre exiting the house and bertholds opening the door you hear some heavy creaking  from the stair that leads down to the main area and you watch as an older woman in her early  fifties or so with her midlength curly brown hair in shades of gray green eyes behind a small  set of reading /none/ spectacles stoic of face wearing what looks to be some sort of a finely crafted  silk robe clutching a book under her arm comes down the steps and looks down and goes taryon  sam mama  matt taryon my boy and she sets the book down and walks up puts her hands out as she says  oh takes you at the sides of the face and pulls you in for kisses oh terribly sorry i  didnt realize that we had guests  sam oh yes these are my allies and my friends this is the team /none/ known as vox machina they are a  fearless band of adventurers and they have taken me in as their own  matt look at you so rugged  sam well yes i am a bit  matt so youve had some adventures with my boy have you  all we have  matt thats wonderful have you spoken with your father  sam yes ive spoken to father and sister and its good to know theyre healthy and its lovely  to see you as well have you been happy at all this last year  matt i and /none/ she reaches back and takes the book off the step and goes ive been making my  way through your library  sam oh oh my books in my room  matt yes well ive had a lot of time to myself been a bit under the weather for some  time and these have kept me fine company  sam oh thats lovely i hope youve enjoyed them as much as i did whats your favorite one  matt well not this piece of trash and she sets it down theres one what was it called  the rivers /none/ dawn it was a brilliant  sam before the rivers dawn yes  matt before the rivers dawn that one yes it was a continuation of the creation myth of  wildmount but it turned into the spirits of the gods these two fauns and they fell in love but  could not be together because the dawn had to rise and the sun would shine  it was very very beautiful  sam yes yes no it was but also heartbreaking at the same time  matt very much so it reminded me of you  sam yes thats /none/ one of my favorites as well  matt well i didnt break the binding too much i hope  sam ill fix it if you did its all right  matt all right  sam well thats wonderful to hear im glad youve been entertaining yourself i know living  with papa can be very hard and its been very hard on you all these years  matt if you would excuse us for just a moment please just a few moments and she points  towards the door  sam i told you they were like this  travis /none/ yeah no were going out the front door front yard  marisha bottle of wine  matt berthold is leading you out of the main area out the front door  travis yeah front door  laura out the house like get out  matt you guys were on your way out  sam just wait on the fucking porch  liam we got it  laura fine  matt as soon as she has some privacy with you she goes my boy if you could indulge me in some  strange honesty im rather intrigued at this idea i /none/ dont wish to undermine anything that  weve built as a family ive lived a privileged life for a very long time far longer than you and  your sister have ive lived within this house removed from the world i do as responsibility  asks of me my wedded duties as both a wife and a mother and i do so without complaint i have  always seen you fight these same circumstances bravely and i find vicarious joy in your escape  from this place this past year these books are a reminder of that same bravery i /none/ know howaardt has  said many things and he may be right but theres a little part of me that welcomes a little change  in scenery and lifestyle maybe thats what the family needs i dont know perhaps im foolhardy  i know not  sam no youre right to think this way this year has been eyeopening for me and i know that you  care for papa and you are a diligent and faithful wife but i know how hard it must have been to  live this life for so many years and i wonder what /none/ it would be like if you hadnt been with him what  kind of person you would be  matt looking at you looking at your sister i wouldnt change it for the world  sam well things are going to have to change at some point right  matt one way or another i just sighs i just want you to make choices for yourself i want you  to do what you think is right that you could live with duty and blood is one thing but anyway  im talking out of turn  sam no thank /none/ you thank you for that  matt could you not tell howaardt weve had this conversation  sam mums the word all right ill be back and maybe well have time to talk more books later  matt i would like that very much  sam good evening  matt good evening as you leave shes like oh the other one i was trying to remember was  the mountain range of gold it was a wonderful threepart series  sam when you think hes dead but hes not and he comes back  matt well the second book you /none/ get halfway through it before he even turns  and reveals himself  sam i know well you never see the body in the first one so that should have been a tipoff  matt and then the white robes and everything his renewed power its incredible anyway im  sorry you have your friends waiting on you good night taryon  sam yes  liam i want to adopt her  marisha shes awesome  matt so as you step out to greet the rest of your friends  sam all right lets go to the jumping jimmy or /none/ whatever its called  laura hows your mother  sam shes better i mean shes had a tough time that was the longest conversation ive had with  her in many years  laura wow  ashley she said shes under the weather whats wrong  sam i think everybodys super stressed out and heartsick about everything thats happening and  living under a tyrant of a father is not healthy you should have seen me when i lived here i was  not nearly as dashing or as charming as i am now it took me spreading my wings /none/ and flying before i  found my sense of humor my hair looks better my eyes look better  marisha i thought you said that was because of the aloe vera  sam well yes we didnt have any at home  marisha right yeah salt air is better for you  sam i mean life needs aloe to live is something i always say  taliesin thats true  liam ive heard you say that two or three times  sam moisturizing products in general life needs moisturizing products to live  taliesin life needs moisture to live  /none/ ashley i know my beauty regimens changed  marisha life needs moisture to live its way smartersounding  taliesin all right gauntlet dropped  laura all right to the laughing ninny it is  matt all right whos leading this charge probably you taryon  sam i know the place  liam you are in charge while were here  matt youve never been to this place youve heard of it but youd never be seen dead in a  place like this before you lead your way in at this point because when you arrived the sun was  /dung/ still in the sky but it was deep in the sky so by now its postdusk you now see the massive  stone and wood structures of deastok are dark against the everdark sky with the windows now  aglow this warm yellows and orange of the candle and lanternlit interiors you can see there are  hanging lanterns that are put out there and you can see a number of individuals who seem to work  for the city who go and place these lanterns up in each of these poles are now finishing their job  and are /town/ returning to the evening following these lamps along the street the cobblestones are  still really well kept for as old as this town seems to be for a city that isnt a major  metropolis within a kingdom and what your experience has been in taldorei a fair amount of  money still makes it way through this city eventually you find your way fairly far north  into the city until you come across the exterior of the grumpy lily asking a few questions to  guide you to which building it is its much smaller than you /tavern/ expected you see what appears to be a  singlestory pub with one window one door no more than maybe 30 feet on any given side it is  lit from the inside though its dimly lit as you approach and push past the somewhat ajar entryway  you see before you what appears to be three tables three singular stained brown tables one  lone patron sits at the center table an elderly man inspecting a small clay sculpture that hes  enraptured by and a single barkeep to your right that seems to notice your entry a healthy /none/ pale  woman of brunette hair in her forties dressed in a simple gray blouse as soon as you enter and  take in the atmosphere she goes slow day folks happy to have the business  what can i get you  liam jeez grog i dont even know if youre going to fit in here  travis yeah its really tiny  matt your head does reach the ceiling  travis shit  laura just dive in then  sam should we get anything to drink first or just dive in  travis yeah its like how you /tavern/ have to buy something to use the restroom  marisha do you have a shiraz i was just wondering if you had any imports do you have a  red wine  matt yes that i can get for you dear dont worry red wine we can do definitely she walks  over and slams her hand on the side of the bar and what you thought was once the patron now appears  to be the one barman there wait what oh i missed the conversation  travis oh the guy with the sculpture  matt yeah red wine /dung/ for our guests  oh he stands up and begrudgingly walks over you see his back is hunched forward and hes  pained grunting leaves the room for a second  well sit down find a place wherever you like  sam put two tables together i guess  laura all three really  marisha lets just take them all  travis wait this is the meeting place of a dark group right a shady group shouldnt we check  this area for anything shady  taliesin is there shade in this establishment  matt its dimly lit so theres /none/ plenty of shadows  liam its a fivebyfive square do we see anything amiss oh thats terrible 24  matt nothing seems amiss it seems like a shitty pub its the definition of a  poorly attended dive  laura does it look like theres any seams in the ground that would be a trapdoor or anything  matt you can make an investigation check if you want to  laura 17  matt you begin to look around the floor and keep perspective around the area no you see some  stains you see some crumbs and at one /none/ point you look over in the corner and you see what appears  to be a piece of stale bread thats been left under one of the tables and there are three rats  currently eating it as soon as you lean in they all stop and look at you and scatter  laura oh you can keep going  taliesin could be worse they could not be afraid of you  laura thats true  matt laughs they just give you the fuckyou look and keep eating their bread  taliesin thats when you know youve really found

that  laura oh just a conversation with the many  matt what about them  liam i dip my thumb into some wine and i use thieves cant and write discuss  in wine on the bar  matt click she gives a click noise to the old man /tavern/ who goes groan thump are you going to take  your bottles or what  laura no yeah well definitely keep those  matt all right pick them up follow me  taliesin oh were going to get to see the real bar  matt he turns around and shuffles out its like following a bad slow npc in world of warcraft  youre like just go fucking faster his pace is terrible yeah its awful  laura running ahead turning around  matt exactly just waiting  travis over here adventurer  matt eventually he takes you out of /none/ the small pub past the unused kitchen which has another  series of stale bread clumps on the side down to what looks to be a broom closet he gets there to  the edge of the broom closet and pulls out a key ring  laura i want to pay attention to what key hes taking  marisha can i take the bread crumbs from the corner and throw it down  so the rats could have it  matt sure so you walk over to the kitchen and grab some of the bread crumbs and throw them down /dung/  on the ground and you wait there because theres no rats present and youre like bread crumbs  they scatter a little further out you turn around and the minute you turn in the air you hear  skittering and look over and theres like seven rats that just scurried out of the shadows and are  just going at these crumbs immediately  travis i kill all of them  laura sploosh  liam i nudge my sister and say all mine  laura yes that she is  matt he pulls one key and unlocks the small /none/ closet you paid attention creak opens this  rickety wooden door and goes grunt and walks past and hes behind the door expectantly  waiting you guys glance into the space and you can see theres what looks to be a low torchlight  about every ten feet down a wooden stairway that descends about 30 40 feet  liam traps people hiding anything that seems out of place or dangerous  matt traps or people hiding  liam traps  laura ill look for people hiding  matt perception check investigation check  laura 24  liam 24  /none/ marisha and ashley twinsies  matt look at that thats disgusting all right so you guys make your way down no traps in the  stair descent but you make your way to the bottom of the stairs without issue you dont see  anything necessarily fishy you do see these torches have been burning for a little bit a  couple hours and are probably needing to be reupped pretty soon you guys eventually make  your way down and as soon as the last of you whos following up the rear in this by the way  whats /none/ the marching order  sam ill go toward the front with the twins  matt the hallway here is about big enough for you to go single file  laura okay youll hang behind me tary  ashley im in front of grog  marisha yeah ill hang with grog and pike  taliesin im in the center as well  travis im in the back  matt okay so grogs in the very back keyleth percy  laura pike is with grog  matt yeah pikes with grog so well say grog in the back then pike then keyleth /none/ then percy  then taryon  laura yeah  matt and vex and vax and you have trinket in your necklace i assume okay all right so you  guys descend down the stairway as soon as grog you make your way in its tiny you have to  straining squeeze in and duck low and even just walking through the pathway your shoulders are  rubbing against the sides of the wall and your head occasionally bang bang  laura its like you in japan baby  travis i know taking a shower i broke like two shower heads /tavern/  just turning around i was like crash  liam the beds was that like lying down on a saltine for you  travis oh yeah my heels were just over like the  laura we went into mcdonalds and his head hit the ceiling  matt you are a kaiju  ashley a kaiju from the deep a level seven  marisha okay wait before we go any further  matt okay  marisha wait  travis oh my god holy shit before we go any further wait  marisha do i have to be doing a short rest /tavern/ to do the inspiring leader thing  matt its ten minutes it takes to do  marisha oh never mind  laura well no we could stand here for ten minutes  travis yeah no please fucking say some words  marisha im new to the being an inspiring leader thing  matt yeah its ten minutes before you know youre going to go into something  you stop and do this  marisha i shouldve done that at the bar  liam wouldnt that be cool if you were just peptalking us all the way down here  sam /none/ start it now  laura yeah start it now just do it while were walking  marisha okay okay as we walk ill be like you know what guys ive had a lot of time to think  over the year that weve been away  matt the door closes behind grog and you hear it lock  marisha and i feel like weve grown so much as people and you guys are family youre a family  to me and i go on for a while do you guys remember that time in stillben when we very first  /none/ met and we all didnt really like each other and grog i dont think you  understood me for a while  travis still dont  marisha yeah thats fine thats fair hey grog do you remember that one time  matt this is great by the way because at the bottom of the stairs it only goes for about 15  more feet before theres a door theres a man on a stool whos just sitting there going  liam shell just be another minute  travis im about to find out what the inside of a bag of /none/ holding feels like i swear  matt hes not stopping you  marisha do you remember that time i think it was the first time i made you laugh and i turned  into an earth elemental and then pretended to do an im going down the stairs  thing through the floor  travis oh yeah  marisha yeah i just remembered that the other day and i just love you guys so much you know  taliesin i dont feel included in this  marisha yeah i dont think you were around yet but i love you so /none/ much  taliesin okay now i feel better thats all  sam any change in our bodies or anything  liam shes going for ten ingame realtime minutes  matt as you guys are all in the hallway grog at the back you cant move forward because  everyones stopped and youre just like groan all of you who wish to can take 17 temporary hit  points thats by the inspiring leader feat  marisha oh yeah you want to mock until you realize you get your hit points  matt it is your choice as to whether or /none/ not you felt inspired by that and take them  marisha and i love you guys i love you guys so much  matt grogs too uncomfortable to take them  travis no i just start weeping silently in the back  liam i mean lets be honest he wouldnt even feel the difference  matt thats true yeah thats what grog needs is temporary hit points  liam grog would just go sneezes  marisha not showing your sensitivity  laura thanks thanks keyleth that felt good that was a nice trip down memory lane  ashley i feel /none/ inspired  laura oh hey hows it going there  matt you see this guy hes tough and surly looks like a balding man whos just like made of  muscle and anger hes sitting there with one eye open one a little squinted hes just  laura do you feel inspired no  liam not the warm and fuzzy type are you  matt he doesnt seem to respond you do hear like a series of muffled voices and what sounds like a  faint beat of some kind from the other side of the wall just muffled  /none/ taliesin is the password i am what i am not sure too strange a reference never mind  matt he begins to reach over for what looks to be a small lever thats hidden on the side  laura were here to speak to the many  matt stops grunts  sam were in  laura were going to just go on in then  sam that word just gets us in  matt so as you guys enter this doorway as it pushes open youre immediately hit with a wall of  voices and laughter and conversation interweaving in /tavern/ multiple languages this is far more lively  than you expected it would be its a large tavern hall its almost two stories tall but its open  theres a central circular chandelier that hangs over with what looks to be flickering candles in a  circle around it you can see elements of what are almost like a second floor but its more like a  slight balcony outcropping you dont see any doorways its just a level platform above and  there before you you see what has to be three or four dozen people scattered across a /none/ number of  tables all in various forms of dress and many of them are drinking some of them are playing games  of chance some of them are in deep conversation you can see the music though this is a bad  example but its what i have its not a full band per se it looks like theres a set of three  percussionists in the far corner that are all in the process of weaving this rhythmic beat that  shifts and changes some of them are on more of a hand drum some of them are /tavern/ more small percussion  instruments its interesting its not the usual bar atmosphere youre used to  it has almost a weird  sam would you say more like blue man group or more like a subway bucket drummer  matt id say its in between the two actually take a little blue man group and a little bit of  subway bucket drummer its right in between there you guys step into the chamber and take in  the atmosphere a bit whether that be with smiles awe or confusion and care  taliesin thats exactly what i said /tavern/ the real bar  ashley i like this  liam this is like old times  matt as soon as you begin having this conversation and taking in the atmosphere one of  four bar hands sees you approach you see a jagged smile of a hairless man with ruddy skin that  immediately comes up to you aye friends new faces are few and far between here in deastok  welcome to our little slice of the family what can i get you  sam well we brought bottles thats rude isnt it  laura the good stuff is /none/ down here  matt i dont know where you got that shit but put that away  well get you right fucked up eh  marisha do you have a shiraz  matt ill see what i can muster  marisha i like these people  matt slim pickings for room here its a bit early in the evening thats when its the  busiest just find some space sit down folks dont want you to sit by them  dont fucking sit by them  laura thank you do we see room for a large group  matt you /none/ see two tables that have room for half of a large group  laura all right split up  sam why dont we ask them nicely if they would like to move  laura no lets not do that  travis yeah no you do that go by yourself  sam no  taliesin no this is special  travis how about the talkers go to one table  marisha and then the defenders go to another in case shit goes bad i like that  travis the defenders table yeah so im going to the talkers table  laura /none/ yeah obviously  marisha vex tary i feel like you guys are good talkers  laura right  taliesin ill join you  liam im actually going to wander the room  marisha ill sit with grog and pike  travis yeah  ashley yeah shiraz time  laura all right  sam whats our play here do we just keep saying the word many as many times as we can and see  how far it goes  laura this is about as in as we get with the many  sam this is it so now we ask /none/ for her by name or him by name korshad  laura yeah he or she may not reveal themselves too quickly  sam all right  taliesin we could buy korshad a drink  laura that is a beautiful idea  taliesin thank you  laura care of one taryon darrington  sam of course i have just enough for a nice drink  laura oh well cover the drink darling party funds cover the drink its just in your name  sam oh oh okay all right all right im slow to catch on sometimes  laura can we /none/ grab a barmaid  matt you split between the two tables one of the tables appears to be three guys who are in a card  game as soon as you sit down they grunts and then keep talking amongst themselves more about  taking bets bluffing each other giving shit about their home lives stuff like that the other  table has four quiet individuals that are look to be elvish lineage either halfelf or full elf  its hard to tell theyre wearing these hoods that show the ears from underneath but then seem  to block a /none/ lot of the features of their face and guard a lot of the forehead this silk hood that  drips down past the nose on the sides  laura do we recognize any semblance of that garb  matt make a history check  sam history check  laura well my history is shit but 19  matt 19 you havent seen this kind of dress but youve heard of it it seems to be of wildmount  but the eastern side of wildmount not a part of the dwendalian empire this more stems from  zorhaus which is the /none/ other kingdom on the continent its actually in a tense existence  along the border of the dwendalian empire  laura you said it was to the east  matt zorhaus im pretty sure thats what its called  laura it is now  matt it is its whatever its called in the campaign guide  laura oh oh man thats right now you have to stick to what you wrote thats crazy  matt i know ill just have to look it up again but anyway as soon as you sit down at the table  the four individuals /none/ look at each other and then get up from the table and then walk off to find  another place  laura maybe some of us dont smell very good in this group im not one of them though  i smell amazing  liam i smell fucking fantastic and im over there i am going to laze about the musicians and  listen to the musicians and wait for them to finish a set  matt okay  laura i guess all of us can sit at the table because of the people  matt all of you guys /dung/ can sit at the table now that youve forced them off their own space the  guys playing the card game seemed to pay no mind as you sit around the table the barhand that met  you here approaches and once more goes all right looks like youve found a place to sit  what can i get you got you that shiraz you were asking for eh he goes ahead and he pulls up  what looks to be a dark green bottle already uncorked and he brings over a hefty metallic goblet or  tankard and then /none/ pours it in there it appears to be something akin to a shiraz i suppose fills it  to the top slides it forward all right drinks for anyone else eh  travis yeah you got any pies or meat or both  taliesin to drink  travis do they not have food  laura no probably  matt i can get you a meat pie if thats what youre asking i dont recommend you drink it  though you could probably squeeze water from a stone so wouldnt surprise me if you could  travis yeah meat pie and /none/ an ale please  matt all right coming on up anyone else  laura whiskey  taliesin same  matt it can be done so whiskey and you little one  ashley well you said you have things that will fuck you up right  so what would that be considered  matt oh i mean no offense lady but youre a bit smallsized  all whoa  matt i mean that respectfully look im just looking out for my patrons here i dont want to  go ahead and send someone to the local temple  laura she can /none/ drink most people under the table  ashley bring it  matt all right ill take your word for it then  sam ill have another shiraz  matt another shiraz  liam over the earring pickle will you get me one of those as well and dont drink it before i  come back  ashley as a matter of fact i want two of whatever that is  matt all right coming up and he leaves the table  taliesin did you order the drink for when he comes back  sam oh the other drink oh fuck /none/ wait before he goes pardon me i have one more order to make i  would like to buy a drink for korshad courtesy of taryon darrington  and ill slip him a gold piece  travis i thought you were about to shake his hand with two fingers  sam there is a coin between the two fingers  matt korshad you say  sam yes  matt all right  laura i nudge him under the table  matt you want what he likes its going to cost you more than that  laura what does he like /none/  sam whatever it is here is another four and keep another one for yourself  matt thank you very much thatll put you up to yours though we will go ahead and settle your  bills at the end of the drinks but all right korshad it is  taliesin what table did the bartender look at when he said that  matt make a perception check  laura oh i was planning on totally watching that too  taliesin yeah thats a safe 13  laura should i roll too  matt well you said you were looking /none/ too so roll a perception yeah  laura well yeah okay 30  matt 30 okay you gather the direction that he glanced it was a cursory look more to see if the  individual in question was still in the room or not but you got the direction of it and you know  exactly where he was looking three tables and that way there he leaves for a bit and the  laughter is still rising and falling throughout the room the musicians in the corner which are  two younger human boys and what appears to be /none/ a female goliath who has the heavier drum in the  center who is like the midpiece the big heavy drum noises the two guys one of them has a  small set of lap drums light drum noises the faster beats and the guy to the left of her  they could be brothers youre not too sure their features are similar but different enough the  ages seem off the guy on the left has a series of small wooden blocks and what looks to be some sort  of contraption that has three or four different small /none/ percussion instruments that are all fixed to  it and so he is leaping between them all for being just percussion that variety is still  making a cool melody youre still able to find certain notes and certain blends where it still is  a very different and unique atmosphere they manage to bring to this crescendo the piece that  you entered on and it finishes there is no real there is occasionally a couple of claps here  and most everyone is busy about their own shit  liam all right i clap excuse me players  /none/ matt as theyre both looking over to grab a drink to stop and the younger guy with a scruffy chin  and this mop of hair thats a little wild glances over to you yeah  liam that was a really unique piece you guys just did there thank you  matt youre welcome  liam you know i have only ever heard music like that one time and it wasnt here it wasnt in  this city it was actually in emon what was his name dranzel it was a musician named dranzel  this is a long shot /none/ but you havent come across a dr dranzel in your travels ive always wanted to  hear him play again  matt cant say i have sir my apologies  liam oh shit  matt sorry you guys ever heard of dr dranzel and the other guy goes nope  liam orcish stylish hats  matt the goliath woman is sitting there and she is just staring off across the room and goes no  laughter  matt sorry friend  laura im keeping an eye on the side of the room that he glanced in looking for anybody going /none/ and  delivering drinks to the people  matt okay you watch the gentleman who has been getting you guys drinks and he is in the process  of getting all of your various drink orders and pouring what you have requested and he does come  to a point where he gets this one fine jewel goblet that he has specifically set off to the  side and he takes it and washes it and takes care to clean it entirely and dry it off and once its  set there he reaches underneath counting a few bottles and /dung/ pulls one drink uncorks it and there  is this thick dark brown glass jug and as he uncorks it he pours it into there glances over  grabs another thing seems to be mixing it with something else he is being very careful with the  actual amounts he is pouring he finishes that takes a piece of what looks like an orange  crushes it in the inside and leaves the rind and takes it and swishes it for a second sighs and  walks over to a table across the entire hall where you saw him glance /none/ before  sam one sex on the beach  laughter  matt he walks over to a table where you see what appear to be about five different patrons at the  table most of them wealthily dressed two of them appear to be older mercantile or business owners  they wear the jewelry on their hands very extravagantly and displaying both wealth and  prestige to an ostentatious way that you know most highend guild workers or owners tend to display  you are very familiar with caste systems that have emerged in a lot of these central metropolitan /none/  areas and so you can very easily pick up some of those themes two of them appear as a contrast  very simply dressed no jewelry you cant make out any details in this distance and there is one  man who he hands the drink to he sets it down in front of him and slides it forward the man you  see there he has deep brown skin marked there appear to be a number of tattoos that curl up his  arms and up the side of his neck and touch his ears on each side /none/ hes wearing light billowing  clothes of silver and maroon silks that end about the elbow and are just hanging beneath leaving  the rest of his arm completely visible where you can see the tattoo continues up the forearm and  grasps the back of the hand almost like he has a gauntlet on that is just his skin you see around  him a series of gold and silver bracelets and rings that adorn his fingers his face is framed  by a lions mane of black and gray dreadlocked hair because of your perception check at this /none/  distance and your rangerlike eyes you can see what you perceive to be a visible scar on his  throat from ear to ear hes currently midconversation with the patrons at the table  leaned back in his chair in a comfortable setting and as soon as the drink huh  laura can i read his lips  matt sure well the drink arrives and gets pushed forward and you read the barkeeps lips as  he says this drink is a gift to you from patrons on the other side of the place and this  individual who /tavern/ you assume at this point is probably korshad gives a look and goes grunts  and he points over right over to your table across the room you watch as korshad  sits up glances over your direction sees you looking at him directly takes the drink scoots  it over next to his side and folds his fingers and goes back into listening to the conversation  of the other patrons and the barkeep who is standing there is right and then goes back to  the bar gathers the rest of your drinks and brings them slowly over /dung/ to your table and passes  them out all right got a second shiraz for you there sir weve got a whiskey and a whiskey we  got an ale and a meat pie for you and you well laughs he brings up these two mugs  theyre simple ceramic mugs that are dark and handcrafted and he sloshes them up to you and as  you see inside most ale has a good liquidy content this has a very syrupy thick texture to  it he slides both forward and goes i dont expect you to drink both those /none/ back to back  ashley well thats not up for you to decide my friend i get on my earring hey string bean  your drink is here  liam yeah and sarenrae will know if you drink it before i get back so just hold onto it for me  ashley well i cant make any promises  matt and he leans forward and goes this here is the changebringers nectar  you sip this slowly  laura the changebringers nectar  marisha write that shit down can keyleth get up and walk past the diplomats table  and /none/ run my hands  matt well you guys are all at the same table now  marisha oh were at the same table now  matt yeah one table got up as soon as you sat down  marisha oh so we scootched together okay then im just going to lean into vex and give her an  enhance ability on her charisma  laura ooh ill take that  matt okay  marisha you get advantage  laura on charisma checks  marisha yeah on checks  laura i like it  marisha her cleavage gets a little nicer /none/  laura it cant get any nicer than it already is  taliesin very fair  liam all said out loud  taliesin pike which one of those two is vaxs which one of those two belongs to vax  ashley this one  taliesin oh that one im taking a sip of it  ashley take a sip its very thick  matt its very thick and its sweeter than you expected but it has a definite burn that grows  and grows after drinking it its syrupy but because of its syrupy texture as it goes down it /none/  also coats and numbs everything as it touches  liam percy i saw that you have to buy me a whole other drink  taliesin thats fine i put my whiskey in its place and take the whole cup  liam no motherfucker thats not what i said i want to drink that one and the one after it oh  you dont want to start with me fredrickstein  travis are you sipping it  ashley im sipping it im doing as the locals do enjoying it how he told me  matt and you get the sense /none/ its probably a good thing  ashley it burns  matt its almost like maple syrup everclear  ashley ugh  laura gross  travis hows my meat pie  matt meat pies pretty good  travis this is pretty good  laura that makes me want an empanada right now  liam roleplaying guys  matt sadly no empanadas in deastok  sam why isnt he coming over here should we send another drink maybe two this time  laura hes in the middle of a conversation right now  taliesin he has to sit and enjoy his drink /none/  laura let him take some time  ashley slurring words should we sent him a changebringers nectar oh no  laura oh no pike  ashley still slurring i only had like three drinks three sips  travis keep going  laura just tiny sips  ashley they were so small  laura drink some maybe some water too in between each sip  ashley okay maybe some meat pie  taliesin thats whiskey thats supposed to be never mind go ahead  marisha hey whos the changebringer does anyone know i feel like this drink is inspired  /none/ can i do a check to see  matt make a religion check  marisha aw im not good at this pike you know gods  ashley let me see if i know will i know the changebringer  marisha oh please i have no idea i definitely have zero idea  ashley im going to see if i can think of it 14  matt its really not that hard the changebringer is avandra avandra one of the  gods of the pantheon  marisha oh yeah of course we knew that  matt the changebringer is the deity /town/ that looks over luck looks over adventure travel the open  road thats as much as you can glean from your passing knowledge of the deity since you are not  a woman of faith obviously you dont know much beyond that  marisha it just sounded fancy  ashley it sounded so fancy  matt shes also known as she who makes the path  laura hey tary  sam yes is it time should i go over there  laura just calm down this is mainly what im trying to tell you right now  stop being so /none/ weird  ashley do you want a sip of changebringers nectar  laura it might actually help you just a little bit  taliesin do what we do any time theres trouble sit down pay attention  and do everything she says  laura and dont look sneaky  taliesin have a sip of this itll help  laura yeah seriously just have a little sip a little sip  its always good to relax your nerves  sam all right  ashley looseygoosey  sam ill take my helm and cock it to the side  laura yeah jauntily /none/ thats good yeah  taliesin okay now i feel like im on a listing ship  travis whats your confident face look like more tongue little further yep little higher eyebrow  on the right side  laura okay maybe stop im just afraid hes going to look over here at any moment im keeping  an eye on good old korshad and seeing if he looks over here i also want to see if i can catch his  lips and see what hes talking about over on the side there  liam and i would like to look /tavern/ around the room and make sure that other people arent watching us or  if so where in the bar they are  matt make a perception check  travis and i would like to make my way over to the goliath woman  matt okay so as you begin walking in that direction vex couple things one you notice  that korshad while he seems to be mostly being talked at or at least just listening to a  conversation when he does speak he leans in and does this  laura of course he fucking does  matt /none/ you get the sense hes a very guarded man and this is not his first rodeo he speaks through  his fingers  laura i do too  matt but he doesnt appear to look over at your table again he seems to have acknowledged the  drink is enjoying it slowly and is back enthralled by the conversation at his table what  did you roll  liam 25  matt 25 and what did you say you were going to do  marisha mimic vex  matt okay you both cover your mouths  laura what are you /none/ doing  marisha im following your lead  laura you dont have to do that  taliesin does this one still work we can do this one  laura yeah that ones good just this  ashley is this good  laura thats it pike pikes got it hes definitely going to come over and talk to us now  i can feel it were so cool  taliesin this is a lot of drink that i seem to have taken on  matt vax glancing about the chamber remember i said there was a secondary platform that didnt  /none/ have any doorways to rooms but there was just the upper walkway across the room both ways there are  about six figures on each one  liam six on each one  matt theyre all sitting there wearing leather armor mostly covered by a cloak you glance up  and you can see underneath at least two of the cloaks what appear to be the shape or outline of a  crossbow at the ready  taliesin 12 of them 12 men  liam i relay to the group quietly yes packing 12 or so above us all so /none/ no sudden movements  matt the music picks up again grog as youre walking over the next piece is occurring and you  can see now that while the previous one had a frenetic tribal beat this one has more of a  scattered if i could say percussion jazz sense it tends to have multiple changes yeah if you  could if you havent heard the jazz timpani before its fantastic its more of an  improvisational piece you can see where theyre each building off of each other and then one will  make a change and the /none/ others will shift with it you dont notice this because you really dont  care but anybody who had musical interests would be able to pick up on this but you walk up and  you see the goliath woman most of the goliath women youve come across their lifestyle leads to  either very shortkept or very tightly bound hair as the coarse hair of the goliaths tends to mat up  very thickly when living in the wild as your tribe did this goliath females hair is really well  kept actually its almost shining which catches you /none/ off guard entirely shes not tattooed and  appears to be in a trance as shes in the process of drumming away not even looking at the two of  her compatriots or any patron shes spacing out and is currently enraptured  by the music shes creating  travis are there any weapons around her feet or where shes sitting or playing  matt make a perception check  travis three  matt she has very nice boots and as a man who has made boots in the past you can acknowledge  those are very wellmade boots  /none/ travis me grog  liam i just love the alacrity that travis goes to two three its so good  travis you play good  matt the head slowly turns and the eyes focus for a second in the dim snowblind looking pupils  and gives you a nod  travis nice hair  matt head turns a little to the side  travis ill be if you  ashley tell her she has nice boots grog  travis what  ashley tell her she has nice boots  travis nice boobs  matt bang big drum hit and her /none/ part of the song comes to a halt the two other bits of music  alter but continue the beats and she just  travis boots nice boots bidet and i go back to the group  matt as you walk back to the group a little dejected vax since youre the one whos paying  attention the most at this point you notice as the goliath gets this small grin on the side of  her face and continues to go back to the drums  laura you charmed her  marisha look at you  liam nice work /none/ de bergerac  matt but grog doesnt see it  ashley ill be your cyrano  matt all right so whats the next order of business guys  taliesin is that conversation breaking up  laura thats what i planned on doing is waiting out that conversation i in no way want to  interrupt it  matt about 20 additional minutes go by another round is bought at the table with korshad still  slowly very carefully sipping the drink that you guys bought for him doesnt appear to be slowing  doesnt appear to be breaking you can /tavern/ keep waiting if you want  laura i want to get one of those fancy drinks for myself and see what it is  sam you mean the korshad drink  laura i want one of the korshad drinks  matt one of the korshad drinks okay  taliesin i would assume youve already had this stuff at this point weve been sharing a cup  around this is too much for a human being to handle  matt do you go to the bar  laura ill go up to the bar we dont know his name do we /none/ the bartenders name  matt you havent asked him yet no there are a few barhands that walk around but the one youve  been going with you can go ahead and catch his eye as you go through the area  hey do you need something  laura of course darling i didnt catch your name  matt oh wence  laura wence thank you so much could i grab another of those fabulous fivegold drinks there  that you brought to our friend  matt oh you want schlonds embrace okay if youre sure about that  laura /none/ i dont know what is it  matt its an acquired taste its made from a very longdistilled 40year processing of a heavy  mint leaf and that when its been very thickly fermented is mixed in with this very sour port  base thats been repeatedly funneled and sifted until its become almost thick in its own right  thats mixed together with a few other sugars and a bit of a special fruit honestly i think it  tastes pretty shitty but its what he likes  laura im going to give it a go  matt all /none/ right then five gold he goes and makes the drink for you again  laura slowly but surely marking little amounts off this party fund yall  marisha need to make some more money  matt however he does not bring it in the same glass he brings it in a regular glass you get  the sense that the glass that was filled was his own but its delivered and its different it  almost has a weird mushroomy flavor to it the fermentations involved in the processing of this  is not the type of alcohol youd expect /tavern/ its a little musty but its functional and it has an  aftertaste that comes to a very strong mint like a wintergreen afterwards  its a very strange mixture  laura its like brushing your teeth only you get drunk  matt yeah kind of in fact elements of it taste like having orange juice  after brushing your teeth  laura foul  matt yeah its a little rough at times  marisha what are you learning about the man by what he drinks  laura im learning that he probably has minty fresh breath  marisha oh /none/ really  ashley maybe you should cheers him from afar so he can see youre drinking it  laura yeah but mines in an ugly cup  marisha they didnt give you the same cup  travis i have nice cups do you want a jewelencrusted chalice  laura do you have one  travis yeah  laura pull it out  travis im like fucking bed bath and beyond in this bitch jewelencrusted chalice  laura do you really have a jewelencrusted you do in your fucking bag of holding  travis not anymore its getting marked off now /none/  laura sweet im going to clean that shit out pour it in  taliesin the interior of that bag looks like the pirates of the caribbean ride  its a little weird in there  matt it is a silver and pewter chalice that contains a number of multicolored gems embedded  along the sides going to the base  laura this is gorgeous  matt lil jon would be proud its beautiful  laura taryon you drink out of this one  sam that drink  laura yeah youre the one that bought him the drink look like /tavern/ youre drinking it too  sam all right pinky out  laura how is it do you like it  sam i love it whispers its terrible  laura i know  sam ill just laugh way too loud laughs and then she said to me thats not armor  matt another 20 or so minutes pass in the tavern  matt some folks have entered since then some have left the patrons that are here dont seem to  be there isnt a lot of switching in and out seems like most of the folks here come here fairly /none/  often at the end of the day whether to go about their business or to unwind but no one seems to  be approaching you no ones crossing your path  marisha im so bored  laura can i go over and talk to wence one more time  matt sure you catch his attention he comes back to the table as you step up and start in his  direction he goes hey another round eh  laura actually no i give him five gold  matt all right you want another one  laura no id rather /none/ not no i was just wondering do you know how long korshad usually  hangs out here every night  matt varies easily probably another hour or so  laura always with the same company or different people  matt varies theyve been here most of the afternoon  laura oh wow would you mind going over to him and just letting him know that the gentleman who  bought him the drink would love a moment of his time  matt oh all right  laura taryon darrington he needs to know the name  matt okay i will /none/ he looks at the gold and goes all right i will  laura no rush but make sure it happens  matt you see he noticeably gets a little nervous walks over do you go back to your table to join  your compatriots okay as youre watching he actually has to psych himself up he approaches  and then turns around and stops for a second and goes up to the table again and stops himself and  gets the gumption up this time and goes to the table and you see him talking to korshad who at  /none/ this point has his hand on the tip of the drink glances up at him looks over at the table again  laura i walk over and put my hand on taryons shoulder and keep eyecontact with korshad  matt you see a smile creep slowly across korshads face puts his hand up and immediately  you can watch as wence whos in the middle of talking and expressing this goes yes and  quickly darts away korshad gives a point to the rest of the guys and you watch his lips say  excuse me a moment he stands /none/ up  sam make some room grog leave  marisha i scoot with grog  travis we get up i get up  marisha i get up with grog too oh i have to pee do you want to go pee  matt as korshads walking across the room vax you do watch as all the individuals that are on  the upper platform all watch him go through the room and are now seeing the table and where they  are standing the attention is very strongly on what is about to transpire  liam so far just eyes /none/ though  marisha yeah i start paying attention to the room as well with grog  liam grand poobah here  laura you said that over the earring  liam that was liam  laura okay  matt korshad walks his way over to the table and you can see as he walks through occasionally  somebody at a nearby table will stop and watch him him very quickly to you you get the sense that  hes definitely one of the more powerful figures that seems to come in and out of this  establishment he approaches the edge /none/ of the table still holding the cup from the upper lip  theres like a lip at the very edge that he keeps clasped with his fingers as it drifts there in  front of him and he occasionally sips from it that way as he walks towards you comes up to the  edge of the table do you mind if i sit here  laura oh please join us  matt he sits down and places the cup on the table muffled so  laughter  matt my man wence tells me that you are requesting my presence /none/  laura yes for the sake of this im going to move my hands but just know my hands are here the  whole time okay  matt okay  laughter  laura im sure youre familiar with taryon here  sam taryon darrington of the darrington family  matt i have not had the pleasure but i know of you  laura and you are familiar with his father as well  matt quite  laura weve heard tell of recent situations with his family and you  matt and  laura and we were hoping we could come /none/ to an agreement  matt what agreement do you have proposed  laura well i dont know if youve heard of vox machina  matt we trade in a great many things information being one and i am well aware of who you are  laura and im well aware that someone like you could find a good use for someone like us  matt are you offering your services  laura potentially if it could help clear the darrington name  matt sighs you are not wrong i myself am the keeper of the deeds i consider the darrington /none/  estate a longgrowing loan that is now ripening you see our community here thrives on a principle  that other syndicates in exandria lack patience i have been letting this stew for a very very  long time so if you wish to make any sort of dent in this debt  your task will have to be equally monumental  sam well i can make magical items if theres something that you need made or enchanted we have  other members of the group that do different things we have a fine tinkerer if you need  something /none/ made for you vex here is an excellent shot she could put on an archery show or  something if that would be something worthwhile to you you know if that will help ease the debt  i know my family owes you quite a bit of money  laura 230000 gold if were hearing correctly  matt you are correct for the time being  sam and might i inquire as it is my familys debt what is the timetable on that will you be  coming to collect anytime soon  matt i have given your father a /town/ date of six months to pay this debt if it is not paid then  the deeds as agreed upon many years ago transition to my name entirely i am not going to  kick your family to the street i am not a terrible man  but i will be possessing all of your belongings  sam will they be in any physical danger  matt no not unless they put up a fight  sam well i dont know much about you but i assume you would much rather have the cash than have to  own property /none/ and manage it  matt both have their uses  sam all right  laura so would the darringtons simply work for you  matt the family i will happily give them time to find whatever place they can afford to live or  leave the city entirely it is not my business however i will be taking over the farms i will  be taking over the business i will be taking over the estate most of the assets within they will  become property of the myriad  taliesin well there thats where i think we could come /none/ to an arrangement were not particularly  invested in the power structure here were here for sentimental reasons the estate and just  enough property to maintain a modest comfortability we dont really care what happens  to the fortune so long as your familys taken care of  sam yes i guess  taliesin you keep your house you keep your things you keep a little bit  of property to manage  sam sure  taliesin what do you think i mean they did make this bed im suggesting to you that maybe it is  not your /none/ job to save your familys power and allow them to keep going as the way they have but just  to give them enough that even if they that they can continue with reasonable means maybe not  necessarily living the life that they were living before but living far more comfortably  sam even that would be a step up but it seems like we would have to do something in order just  to earn that much  taliesin oh i imagine so its just theres a difference between saving everything and saving  enough to keep them /none/ comfortable  matt if i am to understand you correctly you are willing to offer your service to us  taliesin possibly  matt and in exchange we would still be taking the landbased assets from the darrington name  other than the estate and enough means to live comfortably  taliesin and enough income property for them to be relatively comfortable reasonably comfortable  im sure we can take a look at the assets and come to a very very reasonable arrangement and you  in turn well we could have a discussion about what that would be worth /none/ to you i have no  interest in making an arrangement that doesnt please you were only here again for  sentimental reasons we are not invested beyond that  matt make a persuasion check  taliesin please god youve been terrible today 15  matt he goes comfortable living is a relative thing to maintain my comfort of living well  your estate is but a drop in the bucket but and i mean no offense as he looks about the rest of  you comfortable living for some of you well that could be as much as my /dung/ drink would cost  sam my family would require their main property and all residential rental property  matt that is not a deal the residential and the farm territory is to become mine i would leave  for them your estate and enough gold to live a comparably comfortable lifestyle than living on  the street for years to come they could then strike out on their own start a new fortune if  they wish perhaps land barony was not their strong suit you seem to have found other  pursuits maybe you could lead them in a /dung/ new path  laura and past that point they would be in no debt to you  matt past that point and a task done in our favor by the famed vox machina maybe  sam would they get to maintain possession of their personal property artwork statues  matt everything that remains within the estate home itself would be yours to keep  the rest is mine  sam and what is this task  matt roughly 120 miles east of here lies a sinkhole it has swallowed the core of the  platinum mines of herethis a few /dung/ months back now those mines are a very lucrative point of business  for my employers and every time weve sent scouts to inspect the source of this erosion none have  returned many very capable and proven men unheard again one of our greatest diviners has  since spoken of a powerful force within this mine ancient birthed improperly but now seems to grow  more and more mad were at a loss so weve put out a contract or two but nothing has taken a  bite yet if you were to go to this mine find this /none/ entity that has ruined our mining operation  there return with proof of its demise and we confirm its destruction  i will consider our task complete  taliesin well also need some operating capital for this it sounds dangerous so we will take the  job but we will need to also charge a very reasonable fee i think on top of this  matt that is entirely understood and we will keep track of each fee and we will deduct it from  the materials in the darrington estate  laura if we take care of this for /none/ you it does seem like a monumental task  matt it may not be but it would seem to be something of your skill set  laura from what weve learned ancient beings tend to be quite powerful we would ask that you  dont slander the darrington name that when they stay in their estate everyone believes they are  still the darringtons as they have always been  matt i would agree to that i have no interests in your familys public image i believe that  damage has been done well enough on your own  sam /none/ yes are you sure you dont have a cloak i could just enchant  and then we could call it square  matt chuckling he takes another sip from his drink when all this is said and done taryon  well be in contact i think there is much business we could do in the future  sam all right i suppose we have no choice  taliesin we do  laura theres always a choice dear  marisha you could marry the girl or we could go kill an ancient being  taliesin im feeling pretty good about this /none/ one  marisha yeah  sam all right  laura do we need to decide at this moment  sam seems like we do  taliesin we will also need all of the information you have on this creature in the mines and  if you have anybody who has access to that  laura the diviner would be wonderful to speak to  matt the information i have given you is what the diviner has found  sam im not going to ask you all to risk your lives for my shitty family so i will pursue this  /none/ matter on my own if i have to  laura good yeah youre going to go by yourself  sam well i would hire a couple of people to come with me but if youd like to accompany me id be  okay with that too  travis we could watch you do it thatd be pretty funny  sam well i mean youve taught me a lot so maybe i could do it  laura i think youre good  ashley you wont find anybody as good as us  sam of course not  marisha you are very /tavern/ skilled in hiring talented mercenaries that might be your strongest suit  sam i am one for two on that count  taliesin and we do have another mercenary at our beck if we need thats actually very fair  youre already one up  sam should we vote on it then grog do you want to go kill something big and scary  travis yes  sam pike are you drunk  ashley i think you should marry whoever you want so thats what i think we should do yes yea i  vote yea  sam twinsies  /none/ laura always have your back dear  sam oh vax isnt here hey vax you want to go help me save my family by risking our lives in  almost certain death  liam what does that entail  sam ill take that as a yes keyleth  marisha vax says yes and so do i aye  sam science bro  taliesin vex says yes and i am so in the mood to kill something  laughter  marisha i think weve all risked our lives for each other at one point and another so its your turn  /none/ tary welcome to the family  taliesin cheers this stuff burns  matt and this whole conversation hes had his mouth covered he takes his fingers away from his  mouth and he takes the drink do we have an accord picks his drink up and clinks it return  when the deed is done slaps the table and stands up and walks back and at this point that you  notice the tables nearby everyones been just quietly watching in on this as soon as he leaves  they go back to their business and drinking  taliesin everyone /none/ on the count of three were going to stand up very quickly  marisha okay  sam why okay  liam wait no im just fucking with you  laura three lets go  matt as you do that about half the folks get startled by it the musics still going  laura on the way out can i grab wence again one last time  matt hey  laura most of the people here are they local patrons or do they come from all over  matt most of them are local and come from all over  laura /none/ great thank you  matt sorry  laura its all i needed  matt i just serve the drinks miss  travis can i make my way back over to the players  matt okay shes sitting there drumming  travis can i have your name  matt drumming  travis louder can i have your name  matt as shes still drumming her head slowly turns around and she goes camilla drumming  travis thank you and i leave  matt laughs all right with that were going to take a break try and get back here in a /none/ minute  guys see this next bit of

sam thanks  matt as you guys have found your way out of what seems to be this strange subterranean bar beneath  the grumpy lily youve agreed to at least /dung/ for the time being to make your way east to this  mine which currently seems to be under the whats it called the platinum mines of  herethis herethis which you taryon you understand herethis is a region a regional  forest area over there the herethis wood about 120 miles east you guys decide whats your best  means of travel how do you intend to get there  sam we have to misty there right because you dont know any trees in the area  marisha i could scry on the area if i knew enough about /none/ it  taliesin if we misty there we could also camp for the night  laura yeah we need to camp because we need to rest and get our shit back  marisha thats fine its 120 miles  matt its not terribly far as the mist flies  marisha yep im pretty fresh  taliesin we can misty there camp for the night  travis repeatedly getting deeper yeah  laughter  travis character voice  matt well ill go ahead and by the way because i totally forgot we do have a winner in the  chatroom besolis8926 /none/ you won the giveaway  liam you got the nutter butter box  matt yeah denova will contact you for your information to get it shipped to you so  congratulations all right so what are you thinking about for travel youre just doing the  wind walk  marisha all right before we leave is there any type of research we should potentially do  travis nope headlong  laughter  sam i dont know what wed be researching the guy who sent us on the mission doesnt even know  what it is  liam its not even /dung/ nearby so its not like we could ask people what the mine is like its 120  miles away  travis yep  liam the mines of hear this  laura herethis  travis this is right up our alley like this is literally what weve  been training for our whole lives  marisha i mean just in case theres maybe some ancient deity that rules over the forest of  herethis and some sort of goddess fuck it lets go  laura i mean do we know anything have we ever heard about the woods of herethis or /none/ the platinum  mines of herethis  matt you guys havent you have theyre woods that lead into this small rocky its almost too  small to be a mountain range and more just large rocky hills but theres no historical  significance to the location that you know of go ahead and make a history check  travis roll high  taliesin thatll do  sam oh yeah 21  matt 21 you do know a number of the largescale battles that took place towards the end of the age  of arcanum took place on wildmount in fact /none/ zorhaus the other kingdom that we were discussing  before is largely a badlands barren landscape because that was where the final battle between  the betrayer gods and the prime deities took place and the sheer volume of the sheer  intensity of that battle laid waste to the landscape there so you have the dwendalian empire  and the whole western side of wildmount which is fairly lush and functional then towards the  zorhaus kingdom is and that whole eastern side of the continent a lot of it is just barren  cracked destroyed but you do /none/ know that herethis the name at least stems from a hero that fell in  a battle long ago you cant recall the specific details of it but there is some significance to  the title or at least the location there to something ancient and old may have to deal with  this time period of entities battling gods thats the best you can make out the mines are well  known the platinum mines are well known theyre not well attended theyre not a public space and  theyre definitely under the control of a number of companies /dung/ that are shadow corporations under  the control of the myriad you can see where the connection and the necessity for it to be reopened  again is important platinum is not a very common metal  travis anything we should be worried about  sam gods attacking us  travis nope  marisha trial run  laura oh man no but really thats where the battles took place huh so this ancient being  could be from potentially  sam or it could not  taliesin whatever it is its not leaving the mine  liam were running off /none/ on a lark but weve raked ourselves in the faces before  laura yeah if we die we die  sam oh god i dont want to die  taliesin well no one wants to die  marisha well once again  laura dont say it keyleth do not fucking say it  travis dont incant that shit again  laura dont say it about all of us and doom us to your fate  travis goldfish  marisha duty  laughter  travis better  sam before we go was there something you wanted to tell the drow woman /none/  laura oh shit  liam if were talking about what we were talking about before i dont think its a good idea  travis why  liam if you want to go and find him us and say hi thats a different story  laura i would like to point out that this same person you are so adamantly protecting from our  scrying or our spying or our finding is the same person who shit in the middle of a temple so that  he could watch pike  liam well a he did that not us and /none/ b we were all very much friends and happy with each other  when he did that and he is not happy with us its not exactly the same thing dear but if you  want to go with me and find him and check in and say hello id be very happy to do that  with you but to send the woman who threw our friend drugged over the back of a horse and  took him off to his family i dont really want to send her after scanlan to look in on him or  follow /none/ him or watch him or anything him it didnt sound like his father wanted him dragged back on  the back of a horse and it happened anyway she doesnt seem very trustworthy to me yeah shes  cool so what  laura i just realized i have the other half of the stone the traveling stone  marisha that we gave scanlan  laura i could pop in on him anytime i want  taliesin or he could pop in on you anytime  marisha but he hasnt  travis if he has it still  marisha yeah maybe /none/ he threw it into the ocean for all we know  travis ooh that would suck because then wed be in the ocean  laura that would be really really shit if he did that  marisha it would be a massively dickish move  liam that was very smart grog  travis hey  taliesin wow that happened  travis in your face  liam oh anyway my point still stands once we wrap up here if you want to go  find him i will go with you  marisha and do what convince him to come back /none/  liam no  marisha see if hes okay ask him how his years been  liam yeah  travis what about just a location and she has to stay unseen you know i know keyleth can scry and  stuff but  taliesin we could make her walk first into the mines  marisha yeah you didnt want me to even scry on him and now were talking about just popping in on  him i feel like theres a weird crossing of the lines  travis yeah but that was a year ago im over that sentiment  /dung/ marisha oh man grog  travis yeah yep  marisha you guilted me very hard on that you made me feel kind of shitty  travis this is grog evolved  marisha no you kind of got it right just go with it  taliesin and laura exalted  travis absorbed yep  liam you done been woked  travis woked  liam so woked  laura no but seriously what are we doing i dont think we use that mercenary to walk into a  mine im not sending her to her death  taliesin i am perfectly content /town/ to hold onto that chit for as long as we need  liam save that for a rainy day we dont need to punch that ticket now  sam should we at least ask her to stay in town for a tobedetermined mission later  travis well i think she needs to keep up her employment right  sam we can give her a little money to keep around a retainer  laura no  sam i can give her a little money i might need her  taliesin she was employed shes reachable through employment we can just find /none/ out how to  reach her  travis oh yeah that one  sam she might be gone  taliesin you have to be able to hire her im sure theres a system  sam we have no idea how she was hired in the first place  laura we go ask her how to hire her  sam all right well then lets do that  marisha and no one has heard from him at all over the course of the year  travis who  laura oh well he writes me all the time but outside of that /none/  travis what really scanlan does  marisha shes messing with you  travis that was very mean  taliesin you promised youd keep that secret  liam she has a mean streak  laura laughs i have so many secrets to keep dear so many  travis im mad for an stutters a long time  liam i know one of them when she farts it sounds like a duck  laura it really does  marisha thats kind of cute  laura we go find laughs  taliesin youre going to fart awkwardly and were going to yell /none/ imposter  matt all right so you find krynn she let you know that she was just around the corner from where the  estate was and let you know where to find her and its like an open tentlounge area shes just  currently drinking water and eating a little bit of dried meat and as you approach she stands up  she still has her illusion on she still has her pale skin you get the sense that drow in general  are not they dont have the easiest time walking through large societal establishments  you returned /none/ so what did you need  sam we have no mission at this moment but we may call on you shortly after we return  matt very well  sam can we find you here or will you be gone  matt i have no interest in staying in this city in particular  i generally prefer to stay around vashlow  sam wheres that  matt vashlow its to the west of here about 25 miles southeast of port demali  travis port demali  matt if you wish to contact me you can send a missive to vashlow /none/ or if you have access to a  practitioner of the arcane arts perhaps a sending would be sufficient  sam sending okay  laura definitely  sam all right well stand by well call you thank you for your time and well be in touch  matt very well it was just business  sam sorry about your horse  matt eh fair trade she gets up and gathers her little satchel over the side of her shoulder  until we meet again she nods and then walks out into the darkness of the night  laura never to /none/ be heard from again because well forget that we have that connection  laughter  matt all right so what are you guys doing  sam lets misty step lets wind walk  laura misty step tonight and then that way we can recover everything  taliesin in the morning  marisha yeah what time is it  matt youre in the evening now  laura lets misty step there  matt misty step is a very different spell  laura oh sorry  liam we go 30 feet  laughter  sam were going to be windtalkers  matt /none/ yes all right so you guys go ahead and transform into your misty forms via the wind walk  spell and begin making your way to the east towards the herethis wood travel is pretty rapid  its a clear sky the moons still pretty its only been a few days since the last full moon when  you guys had the ritual up at the top of the mountains with the trickfoots so its very easy  to see the details especially those of keen vision rather rapidly you find yourselves to the  outskirts of the herethis forest /none/ and after doing a couple passes overhead you can see there is a  portion of the forest that is open and there you can see there are a couple of stone towers set up  there appear to be large ropes and cables fastened at the edges of what looks to be a large circular  ravine some sort of an entry port a very large hole in the ground and as you approach and get  close you can see that while there are two standing towers there appear to be remnants of two other  towers that /dung/ have fallen in and looking at some of the cables and the way that some of the equipment  is set up it appears that this sinkhole that he spoke of that consumed a portion of this entryway  whether it be a quake or something a lot of the structure that was placed around the outside of  the mine has fallen in and is precariously being held either dangling over the inside by cable work  or has crumpled somewhere at the bottom of this abyssal hole you see before you  marisha what do you mean by /none/  matt when i say abyssal hole thats just a descriptive way of saying it is pitch black from  this distance you cannot see anything past the top  sam and its connected to the abyssal plane  matt it is actually a doorway to the abyss hey guys orcus tonight  marisha finale  travis do we have any glow sticks that we could throw in and watch fall  taliesin yes we actually do  matt have you guys transitioned back to your physical forms to have this conversation  marisha yeah well we can float down /none/  taliesin if were doing our little circle i would say that a little bit of a distance  laura yeah i dont want to camp right next to the  taliesin about half a mile away  liam im looking for cooties around the outside  matt okay make a perception check  liam cooties  laura did you get it  ashley no its right here  liam dang it 24  matt 24 okay you start coasting over the edge and you can see there are broken carts and crates you  can see the remains of /none/ what seem to be a couple of humanoid bodies mostly picked away to the point  where theres just slightly pinkish bone from whatever dried bits of muscle or blood that  remain the rest of the flesh and organs pulled from or dissolved youre not sure  laura i think a cure wounds a light cure wounds would probably help  sam dead talk  taliesin they dont talk back but yeah  sam lets do that  travis oh yeah you can do that  ashley we can talk to the dead i have it  laura well /none/ land a little bit away  travis we didnt land yet right  laura lets land a little bit away  liam getting some baldurs gate vibes here man  matt so you land about half a mile out and you guys transition back to your physical forms vax  shares the information and what he spotted  laura were the bodies on top or were the bodies down below  liam on the edges right  matt they were on the edges  marisha and when you mean seared like acid or like heat  matt like white and /none/ pink bone like just whatever flesh was on there has been picked off  ashley like something was eating them  taliesin can we speak to dead  laura pike can do that  taliesin why dont you two misty there somebody start setting up camp for tonight  laura ill go with pike and we can stealth in  marisha ill start setting up camp  taliesin you can still misty were still mistyable you can fly in talk to them  and fly back out  laura she cant talk to them as mist  taliesin i mean /none/ land and then  laura oh okay ill cast pass without a trace anyways so well be stealthy going in  so i do that  matt all right so is it just you pike whos going with you  laura and me  liam im already standing by the bodies yeah  matt all right so you go back to the bodies with them  laura okay youre still out there  liam no i  matt all right so the three of you are turning back to mist and making your way back toward the  entrance  /none/ taliesin im going to set up the tents  matt okay you guys land near the edge of this crumpled rock and you see where the ground itself  has curled in and collapsed inward and there are a number of cables or ropes that go across and  various large structures the stone towers that sit at the edge of this opening you can see  theres tension on these ropes and either the ropes going to snap at some point as the weather  gets harsher over here or the rock is going to crumble in if the /none/ ground keeps eroding youre not  sure if its done or if its a slow crawling thing there before you you see a body you can  see elements of clothing torn and dried crusted with old blood you see a boot thats left off to  the side the foots been removed but it looks like the edge of its been torn and ripped a bit  the skeletons been picked clean  ashley okay we only see the one body  matt there are three bodies around the whole exterior but youve landed next to one  liam /none/ when you said picked clean do they look like theyve been chewed upon  matt make an investigation check  liam its fine 18  matt looking at the bones you can see signs of what appear to be scratches or grooves across the  bones its interesting a lot of the bones have a very smooth texture to them youre used to  seeing very porous but it looks like elements of the bones have melted slightly  laura oh gods  liam slimes jellies all right  laura im going to get my broom ready and while pike /none/ is doing her ritual im just going to keep a  hand on her that if anything happens then i can just take off with her in tow  matt okay pike youre casting speak with dead  ashley yes  matt all right its easy enough for you to cast it its quick ritual complete you go ahead and you  burn some incense  ashley okay i get three questions  matt and at which point the skeleton which is face down on the ground by the way the skull  bone creaking creaks up and looks over /none/ like turns around and faces you as it reaches it curls  upward almost in like an upward dog  laura like downward dog oh whats that called  matt cobra position but the heads turned completely around and curled up  liam oh i get down close to it and go groans and i flip it over  matt rattling thud it flips over on its back and the head bone creaking turns back  around to its right  liam sorry  matt you get five questions  ashley five questions  marisha five  ashley good day /none/ sir its not a good day for you sorry  travis wow  laura its okay good start  ashley what happened to you  matt raspy strained something in the mines we found it hatched or woke and its anger shook  the halls i tried to run but the skittering beasts got me first  laura skittering beasts  travis godzilla  liam thats more than one  laura whispering what did the skitterers look like  ashley what did the skittering beasts look like  laura oh in my drink  liam it flew away  marisha /none/ yeah its a dick  matt raspy strained large hard carapaces pincers many legs  ashley whispering its like spiders  travis umber hulk  liam umber hulk with many legs  marisha that could be a glabrezu which fucking killed you the first time they have pincers  laura yeah but thats really big  marisha i dont know skittering beasts  ashley is there anyone else alive  liam did anything work against it  ashley oh yeah thats a good question louder was there anything that you guys could tell of  your knowledge did anything seem /none/ to damage it or work against it  matt grunts he seems confused about what youre referring to the skittering creature or the  ashley oh the skittering creature or the big thing  laura the skittering creatures  ashley both because we still have  liam against them  ashley against them against the skittering creatures  matt the skittering creatures we just ran i didnt look to see  laura thats already three questions  ashley okay oh god this is not  whispering  ashley how big were the creatures  matt they were rather large maybe /none/ eight foot end to end they burrow they spit but they were  awoken by the smaller one  ashley wait he said they spit  laura i didnt hear something about his spit what did he say  matt you gather what he said was  laughing  matt no the skitterers bite they spit but they were awakened by the smaller one  marisha the smaller one  laura whats the smaller one  liam what can you tell us of the smaller one  sam they spit maybe acid probably  liam yeah theyre smooth that means /none/ they were just like slurping noises  ashley is there anything that you can tell us about the smaller one  matt it was like a baby and it cried out and everything fell around us i barely made it out  but the skitterers found me deep exhale the enchantment leaves that embodied the skull falls  to rest the bones now motionless  sam so it can emit a cry that shakes everything  ashley a baby like a baby  liam mandrake  matt i would say marisha  marisha does it sound like anything we have /none/ encountered a nature check  matt well say a nature check for both you and vex  marisha would i have an advantage with my little book  matt not for this in particular  liam it will be like the creature back in stillben  laura yeah i dont think thats what it is  liam and we have heard tales of mandrakes and they scream  laura yeah did the pincers sound like something we have fought though before  matt no its not something youve encountered before necessarily  marisha 19  matt 19 okay and vex /none/  laura nature check  matt yeah  laura do i get advantage because im standing in the woods six  taliesin you know youre standing in the woods  matt you have heard of a creature that does exist in subterranean and sometimes forested areas  referred to as an ankheg  marisha an ankheg  matt an ankheg they generally tend to snatch cattle and beasts of burden in the night they are  large and insectlike they spit an acidic fluid some of the things this corpse has described makes  you think of that  liam /none/ isnt that what our bug juice is made out of  matt you bug juice is made of sandkheg which is a desertbased variant of that creature  laura oh i wonder if we could sprinkle it around us and they wont bother us because well smell  like their brethren  travis i aint wasting that shit  laura hey man its an idea  marisha so they snatch cattle  sam so we should all be cows  marisha oh my god you guys perfect opportunity  liam and marisha throwback thursday  matt if only the person /none/ who could cast the spell was in your party anymore hes elsewhere in the  world right now  liam that asshole  sam we just talked to him he was the dead body  groaning  matt all right so what are you guys doing  sam well were going to rest for the night and then go in at first light  laura yes we definitely should have a heroes feast  marisha yeah lets have a heroes feast which okay hang on let me check here  travis we dont need it  marisha i can do /dung/ a heroes feast  taliesin protection from acid would probably be very  marisha okay but my wind walk i already wind walked so i can do a heroes feast at a higher  level i also want to do a 5thlevel commune with nature  matt okay 5thlevel commune with nature  marisha what should i ask what should i ask that we dont already know  sam i mean is there any nature down there its a mine its all rocks  marisha well i can see in a two threemile radius  travis how deep does the /town/ hole go  marisha i was thinking that  matt instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following  subjects as they relate to the area terrain bodies of water prevalent plants minerals  animals or peoples powerful celestials fey fiends elementals or undead influence from  other planes of existence or buildings  marisha okay  matt choose three of those  marisha first and foremost influences from other planes of existence  matt okay so as you focus and commune with nature the plants speak to you in this series /dung/ of  images and thoughts that essentially get the idea across to you that there is something planar  involved here but its very old and longdormant recently awoken  marisha okay planar long dormant  taliesin recently awoken  travis if its a fucking baby ancient dragon im going to be stoked  marisha okay so something planar  liam didnt drez vina send us to a fetal thing  marisha yeah that was our first fight  sam oh we cant do how deep is the mine no  marisha no i can its a terrain question so /dung/ terrain yeah how deep does this mine go  laura maybe you can ask where the thing is in the mine  marisha is i think i can right can i sense the location of where  matt you can ask whereabouts this thing is  marisha yeah  matt nature tells you this sinkhole goes down for about a quartermile  and it lies at the very bottom  laura its just straight down at the bottom of it  travis thats 400 meters yall  ashley so its like this and then the little baby thing at the /none/ bottom  matt apparently yeah the whole ground just collapsed inward  marisha 400 meters and the entity lies at the bottom  sam we can just jump were like gods  marisha yeah were gods  taliesin were golden gods  marisha its only a little bit more than 1000 feet  laura yeah then you might survive that one only if you turn into a goldfish and fall onto the  ground its fine  marisha now i know looney tune physics doesnt work in this world  liam always go earth elemental  laura and marisha always /none/ keyteor  sam so whats our last question  travis something from another plane we know its 400 meters down  marisha it lies at the bottom  taliesin how many of these creatures are there  travis of the crawly ones  marisha ankhegs can i get a sense of how many and whereabouts the ankhegs are  matt one of the two  laura what are ankhegs are they fiends  liam theyre beasts probably theyre big bugs  laura aberrations  marisha how many  travis yeah because if theres hundreds then  marisha thats a problem /none/  taliesin then this is a stealth mission  matt they are monstrosities and thats what they look like right there  all oh  taliesin i love starship troopers im excited  laura were about to fight some big armored vaginas  marisha about how many do i know about how many there are sensing their skittering movements  under the surface  matt using the natures essence to let you know somewhere in the neighborhood of about close to a  hundred throughout the network of caves  marisha because this is a threemile radius right  matt /none/ yeah so this is spread out amongst what would essentially be a subterranean anthill of  these ankhegs  marisha theres a lot  travis were going to need a fast exit he wants us to take care of what the problem was  sam weve just got to kill the big boss one little baby big boss the boss baby  laura did we understand correctly that its the baby that cried out is the big monster  the big boss  matt it seems to be the source of where all this started  laura okay and thats /none/ the thing that woke up the skitterers  matt or at least brought them to start attacking the surface  laura okay i just wanted to make sure it wasnt like theres a big boss and then theres  skitterers and then theres also little babies that cry out  matt you dont know this is all the information you have  ashley but do we know why the baby woke up what woke the baby  laura no we dont know what woke up the baby  ashley we didnt ask that okay  laura maybe we should talk /dung/ to another dead person  travis nah  sam and taliesin i dont think theyll know  laura theyre not miners  ashley they did something in the mine that awoke it and we can redo it  taliesin i think anybody who was there who saw it probably died at the center of it  liam sorry were trying to remember the very first game of dd we ever played and keyleth  twins grog were there  matt yeah thats right that was what was essentially a dead or stillborn deity a demigod  essentially in its own /none/ pocket plane  marisha so does it have anything to do with this  matt roll a religion check  marisha no im bad at this groans  liam im religious  matt yeah if you want to whoevers having this conversation you can make a religion check  liam luck of the day yes  laura natural 20  marisha are you serious  laura no i havent rolled im trying to make myself roll it  liam i got a 19  laura gasps oh my god i rolled a natural 20  marisha shut up  travis /none/ she really did  laura its like run lola run where shes doing the roulette thing and shes like  matt okay you recall a while back that you battled with that entity you what was it  called crysathul  laura how  matt sighs this is all i do with my free time guys make up shit for fun but that was not tiny  that was a very large entity like to the point where you remember there was a 20footwide well  and a giant fleshy baby arm that slapped out and crawled it out akirastyle /none/ everyone kept saying  small on this one so you dont know if maybe related in some way but youre not entirely  certain it doesnt appear to be the same kind of thing necessarily  not by the descriptor youve heard  liam corpse called it a small one right  matt it called it a small one  travis were good weve still got to camp for the night right  laura yeah were camping but we should camp in the trees yall not in the ground in case the  things come up out  matt yeah /dung/ the thick forest of herethis surrounds the mine  laura oh man  marisha can i druidcraft some web hammocks  taliesin i mean you can i mean weve gone to all this trouble but if we want to add to it i mean  this is just what weve been doing  marisha look i really like elaborate tree houses  taliesin no i understand i respect the art form  marisha i can have a rope bridge here  liam hammock bed  matt well say druidcraft which is a very localized and cantripbased magic you could over /none/  the next couple hours craft a single web hammock  groaning  matt its a cantrip yo  marisha ill pass well just sleep with the ones we have or whatever  liam a thirdgrade diorama  matt yeah this is what it would look like if you were to build to scale okay so you guys find a  place in the trees whos helming finding that spot all right go ahead and roll an  investigation check  laura 15  matt okay  laura oh wait i honestly dont know anymore what my favored terrain does /none/ for me  matt no this is exactly where to use it because forest is your favored terrain this is exactly  the kind of thing it would help with  laura i always feel like im bullshitting it now what am i rolling investigation  matt yes  laura 24  matt 24 you find one massive tree the trees here can get pretty big and theres one thick  tree that the branches are pretty easy to climb and up top it branches out and all the various  branches that make up the canopy its almost like /none/ this little bowl at the very top just underneath  where the heavy foliage descends and its a perfect place for you guys to make a camp higher  up off the ground  laura hey this is a place lets do it here  taliesin ill unload everything  matt all right you guys make camp whos making first watch  travis me  laura all right  liam me too  ashley oh heroes feast  laura and marisha heroes feast  matt all right well say as a note this the last of the chalices you have /town/ prepared if you  want to do any more heroes feasts youll have to specifically go and purchase the chalices or go  look for it in town  liam lets do it  marisha is this including or not including the chalice that  grog gave to vex earlier to drink out of  matt that chalice while it looks quite delightful is not worth a thousand gold pieces  taliesin its from medieval times  matt laughs its a little gaudy  marisha its got michaels michaels crafts  matt yeah every time you drink from it you /none/ get glitter on your hands and youre like shit  marisha how do you turn it off cover it in blankets  laura yay heroes feast  sam were immune to fear  matt youre immune to fear immune to poison and  laura advantage on wisdom  matt marisha you want to go ahead and roll the additional hit points for heroes feast  marisha yeah 2d10 yeah  matt 2d10 i believe  laura were losing our 17  liam lose our 17 from the speech  matt you do  travis thats why i didnt take them /none/  marisha gasps ooh wait yeah ooh thats amazing its a nine and a ten  matt so 19 additional hit points to all of you guys  laura if you give us a speech how long does that last  matt temporary hit points last until they go down or you take a long rest i believe  let me double check  marisha but this is going to be a long rest  laura oh wait but does that mean we lose our temporary hit points on the heroes feast  matt well no theyre different the heroes /none/ feast is in addition to your maximum hit points  temporary hit points are different technically those two stack youre about to lose the  temporary hit points  marisha but then at the top of the morning i can give us another speech  matt should you be so inclined yeah  laura tight  marisha do i have to do it  travis no you dont you dont  marisha fuck you travis fuck you  matt you can give the essence of a speech  marisha right i can do an interpretive dance  travis thats better /none/  taliesin only if you actually do the interpretive dance  ashley wait 19 extra  laura hes giving you a look  marisha a laser light show with fireflies its like in a disney imagineer show  matt its a speech  marisha all right well its a speech  matt you can give the essence of it but the idea here is just you honing  your public speaking skills  laura youre going to get better at it keyleth  liam its like public debate in high school  sam toastmasters  taliesin i love toastmasters  /none/ matt temporary hit points they last until theyre depleted or you finish a long rest yes i  was correct cool  marisha so in the top of the morning  laura and marisha top o the mornin  matt all right well say for the purpose of brevity because even at your guys level if you  did encounter anything in this forest that was indigenous youd splatter it in a round but you  dont have any issues nothing really sees you up in the branches you occasionally get caught off  guard by the sound of a /none/ nearby hooting its an owl in the trees but nothing seems to bother you  during your evening slumber you complete your long rest you still maintain your benefits from  the heroes feast and as morning comes keyleth gives a rousing speech  sam just give us a topic  matt you can just describe the topics you talk about you dont have to give the actual speech  marisha thats great because one can only bullshit so much in a fourhour fucking game i  talk about the smell of our breakfast its bacon in the morning and /none/ taste and smell the fleshy  essence of the pork  taliesin is bacon what were fighting for  marisha no bacon is definitely worth fighting for bacon is worth fighting for and when we kill  that celestial baby we will have the godliest bacon one could ever imagine  sam i do like bacon  taliesin this is the most burning man thing thats ever happened on this show  im flashing back  matt keyleth voice of the tempest  taliesin bacon speech  matt all right guys there you go take your 17 temporary hit points /none/  marisha shes not a great talker and has never been one just want to point that out you guys  all know this  matt no its just her level  laura just add that to the 19 then  matt no because the 17 once the 17 goes its gone  laura but the 19 we can heal to  matt its still your maximum you can heal to it yeah that is the difference  taliesin i always imagine occasionally keyleth gives a speech thats like whatshisname from  animal house  sam matthew im going to /none/ prepare some spells that im going to inject into various coins  matt yes what are you doing  sam im going to drop another 300 gold and give vex another revivify  matt okay  sam grog youre already a good jumper right  travis yeah  sam how far can you jump  travis you gave me a fly coin  sam no thats gone forever thats gone it doesnt last forever it lasts a couple hours  travis well thats bullshit yeah i can jump 15 feet vertically or 20 feet horizontally so not  great like /none/ three squares  sam ill give you a jump coin so that will triple your jump  travis will you sing jump from van halen  sam sure when you do it lets see here who needs things  ashley singing jump for my love  sam oh no you guys all cast things now right  taliesin not really why  liam t give me something show me some magic give me a doodad  sam can you turn invisible  liam i used to be able to but i  sam you gave away your ring  laura /none/ kerr bear oh no it wasnt kerr bear it was tova  sam ill give you a blur coin  laura dont you already have that with your  liam that cloak that i gave away  laura oh yeah that one  marisha thats the one that kerr bear took  liam and laura thats right  matt yeah laughs the inventory of the items youve lost to guests  liam lost gave away  matt lost and gave away  sam ill give good old percival a cure wounds coin  matt what level  sam just one /none/  matt level one you got it  taliesin yeah it will hopefully not come in handy  sam and also im going to change my robe of many things to my new robe of many things  matt okay  sam and thats it  taliesin a vest of several items now  matt laughs the kigurumi of useful trinkets  laura oh hey well no maybe would this be a bad idea  to shoot an oracle arrow down into the bottom  taliesin i think thats been working out very well for us it is pitch black /none/ down there  though isnt it  laura well we have this method that we used to do light the arrow on fire and then send it  down so i can see by the light of the fire on it  liam would that make your actual eyeballs burn  laura i dont think so  sam oh and im going to do one more thing im going to pull out a healing draught bottle and  give it to no you can heal things  marisha yeah im all right  sam you dont need to heal  /none/ travis other people i normally do  sam i give it to vax  travis i turn into nurse betty almost in every fight what are you talking about  taliesin yeah thats actually true  laura thats true he does he does heal people a lot  travis but thats cool you give it to somebody that you know  liam well he can give it to me ive got 50 things i can do a turn  it was what kind of potion  sam a healing draught its not a potion its a bottle of healing shit /none/  liam oh shit  sam its 8d8  ashley and liam 8d8  liam i will never give this up ever thank you thank you taryon  sam sure  taliesin i think that thats a really good idea shooting an arrow down there  liam im going to set the deathwalkers ward to necrotic  marisha ill light my hands on fire so that vex can light her arrows on fire  taliesin so when were ready weve got something to light the  laura wait should i cast pass without a trace on us no im going /none/ to do the oracle arrow first  oh what if we wake it up when i shoot it down and things come out  liam well that is a very real possibility  taliesin well then theyll be easier to kill up here than they will be down there  marisha theyll be 400 meters down i could theoretically drop some awesome fireballs on their  face potentially  laura i like this idea im going to cast pass without a trace on all of us just to be safe so  we can stealth and be quiet yeah but /none/ theyll just keep falling wont they  marisha i dont know  laura how does that work  marisha thats a weird magic question  taliesin this is why magic freaks me out  matt whats the question  marisha if i drop a fireball how long itll go  liam does gravity continue to carry it down  matt drop a what a fireball  taliesin fire a fireball into the abyss will it just eventually stop  marisha will it keep going  matt well a fireball is a small bead of magic energy that has a range /none/ so if it reaches the end  of the range it has no effect  taliesin this is why magics weird  marisha but i could keyteor to the bottom  matt you could  travis were just spoiled for choice  matt you take half bludgeoning damage when you impact  marisha yep advantages to both  liam dropping a great height did not go well for you  travis keyleth did you roll 17 or 19 on your  marisha i rolled 19 but then you get an additional 17 because  my weird speech about bacon  /none/ matt bacon points 17 bacon points  laura it will make the most glorious bacon  matt to be fair ive eaten some bacon in my time thats given me some temporary hit points  just saying  marisha look it was inspired okay  matt oh completely  marisha im not wrong  liam we will not go baconless into the night  marisha bacon has saved many a people  laura all right im setting my arrow on fire and im shooting it down into the pit  matt okay oracle arrow you fire it its a big /none/ pit the radius of a small flame on an arrow  doesnt seem to light up the walls its not bright enough so it just descends and descends  and the wood is catching and burning and eventually it hits the stony earthy floor at the  bottom arrow impact and it clatters and breaks a little bit its burning pretty heavily and you  glance around the space inside and you can see what looks like some broken mining equipment on  the ground jutting out in places you see what appears to be some sort of stony platform /none/ that is  carved but mildly forgotten or eroded steps and the rest of the arrow burns up  and you lose your vision  laura that was helpful super helpful  taliesin worth it it was worth it it didnt cost us anything  laura thats true i didnt see the great baby beast down at the bottom  taliesin and thats information we didnt have and now we know  great baby beast is not at the bottom  laura potentially in that small circle  taliesin its not at the bottom of the topless pit  laura /none/ okay so we could take the flying carpet down a couple of people could fly we can take the flying  carpet down  taliesin two flyers plus the carpet  travis the circumference of this thing is massive the diameter  matt well the diameter of the actual hole is maybe about  travis football field  matt not quite that big id say its about 150 200 feet across  travis stay away from the walls  laura you think the skitterers are going to come out of the walls  travis yeah do not come anywhere near /dung/ the walls  sam when we descend do we want light to be able to see or we dont want things to see us  liam good chance they can see in the dark  taliesin lets have the flashlights ready but not activated  marisha i mean i have a few daylight spells  laura it may be good to blind them if they dwell under the surface  travis you know if were not in a rush deeper if were not in a rush it might just be  nice to send a little mini nuke down into /none/ the hole and see what comes out  taliesin did your voice just crack  travis yeah no its like reverse puberty  taliesin becoming a man okay  marisha im down with that mini nuke it extends a lot of our magical ranges unless i want to  keyteor down  taliesin i think its better especially have we seen a tree that we can port to in case of an  emergency or some sort of object that we can port to  marisha there are definitely a lot of trees yeah  taliesin but there will not /none/ be a tree down there  laura and matt no  taliesin do we have an escape route if we need it  laura we have a flying carpet two brooms a set of wings up and out  taliesin well all right  travis just a reminder that i cant ride the carpet  laura yes you can  liam its a big one  travis is it is it bigger than the first one  taliesin yeah its bigger than the first one  travis so i can get on there with everybody else  laura the only /none/ people we need to get on it are percy and pike everybody else can fly unless  keyleth is out of  marisha well i can polymorph him  taliesin how much weight can the carpet take  ashley i mean you could technically just go on it alone and i could  laura hop on the broom  liam we are versatile as shit  ashley hop on vaxs back  matt okay the flying carpet the one that you have 800 pound capacity  travis okay  sam its you right  taliesin youre 300 pounds right  /none/ travis no im its arguable im definitely over 300  taliesin okay so three of us on that carpet one big one one little one and a medium  matt you can fit grog and one other person  travis hes a big bastard  sam we can take someone on a broom  laura yeah  taliesin ill join you on the broom  laura all right  matt i think you could probably fit grog percy and pike  taliesin yeah okay then that solves it  sam well then lets descend slowly and quietly is that what /none/ were doing  marisha hang on before we go theres a few things i want to do let me doublecheck i dont  want to be a dumbass  taliesin no this is very clever i see what youre going for  marisha hang on wait i might need the book okay one of the things i want to do is i want to  use my staff to create an air elemental so i want to take a minute to use my  spire to conjure an air elemental  matt conjure an air elemental  sam by the /none/ way can i just remind everyone this whole year ive had one half of a communications  bracelet and someones been watching us the whole time  travis what  sam remember that thing i found  laura because you got that down in the fucking nine hells right  sam yeah someones watching us for a year  taliesin oh my god theyre right there  laura that is so crazy  marisha what  travis yeah watching you make fucking blondies all right this channels boring  taliesin the blondie channel  travis hes making armor ugh  /none/ liam guttural growly i want a blondie so bad  marisha im going to conjure an air elemental and then im going to go over to grog and im  going to give him a big hug and say for the next hour no one can keep a hold of you and im going  to give him freedom of movement  travis what is that  taliesin target should now spend five feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical  restraints such as manacles or creatures that have grapple  marisha you cant be grappled  travis so /none/ i just spend five feet of my movement  marisha youre also unaffected by difficult terrain and spells and other magical effects can  neither reduce the targets speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained  taliesin you are parkour  marisha youre parkour  travis im chevy chase in christmas vacation  marisha because i feel like youve been restrained a lot  matt as you finish the conjuration with the staff and slam it into the ground at the edge of the  entranceway you watch as a nearby cloud starts to swirl and descend /none/ and you hear this cracking  sound as the planar shift between your plane and the elemental plane of air briefly hiccups open  and then summons forth an air elemental that whoosh rushes down under your control it is  concentration keep that in mind  marisha yes  matt all righty  taliesin lets go  travis do it  matt so two brooms of flying magic carpet wings  laura and taliesin singing and a partridge in a pear tree  matt and you are  marisha i know im wondering if i should ahead and go /none/ elemental but i cant cast can i get on  the carpet is there room  matt the carpets full  taliesin ill hop on the broom you hop on the carpet  matt okay we can do that all right so you guys slowly begin to descend down  this heavy open tunnel  laura this is just the stupidest were sticking to the middle  marisha did you cast pass without a trace  matt yes so i would like all you guys to make a stealth check please  travis natural 20  laura oh shit flying /none/ carpet ooh shit and add ten yall  taliesin 27  sam 21  liam i rolled a two but its a 37  ashley thats ridiculous  laura 39  liam built into the rules man  matt yep reliable rogues man thats what rogues are good at  marisha 37  ashley 28  travis 30  matt 30 okay as you guys all descend you get about halfway down the tunnel and you can hear  this occasional echo clicking and for those of you that have darkvision you look off to the side  and you /none/ see there are these small openings these tunnels in the sides and occasionally you see a  large insectlike creature skitter out clicking and then into another hole none seem to see or  notice your presence you continue delving deeper and deeper and deeper looking up above you can  see the slowly vanishing circle of daylight above you and as you continue further and further down  those of you with darkvision you begin to see a floor begin to approach  sam dont land  laura dont land  sam do we need light  travis no /none/ not yet i halt the carpet 20 feet off the ground  matt okay you halt the carpet  laura and were whispering were whispering but were not whispering so that people can hear  were definitely whispering over  ashley can we see any little creature in the middle of anything  matt make a perception check  laura can i look too  sam i have some sort of a cloak over my helm since it emits light always  matt okay it doesnt block all the light because its the helm of brilliance as you guys are /dung/ being  somewhat stealthy going down here taryon is still a slight beacon of fire his helmet just emits a  glow at all times  travis cool because insects dont love lights in the dark  marisha i know  ashley 25 for perception  laura 22  matt okay you glance about and you can see this opening at the bottom theres some warping to the  earth here its one large chamber thats almost peanutshaped it pinches in the center and closes  around and theres a small tunnel that leads off and then closes at the /dung/ end it appears to be what  may have been some sort of mine shaft that has then collapsed on the opposite side but the  center here looks like theres some fallen barrels and chest pieces and there are pieces of rods and  rope and cords strewn about and theres this ancient stone platform that rises up in the  center and what appears to be some sort of a small recess in the stonework there it looks like  its the size of a football carved downward  sam i was wrong it only emits light when /none/ theres undead around  matt oh  laura is it emitting light is it like an orc  matt it is currently not emitting light  laura should we just nuke it should we just nuke that thing  travis the ancient platform no dont do that

of light hovering maybe  ten feet up off the ground about the same height that you guys were to the platform and you see  there what appears to be a cherub its a baby or an infant but it appears to be withered and gray  and its arms and legs hang limply and it has /none/ these small white angellike wings but the  feathers are tattered and broken in places and the heads lolled back and as the glow grows from  it it goes wheezes screams and gives out this heinous scream that echoes throughout the whole  hall you cant help but instinctually grab your ears i would like you all to make a wisdom saving  throw please  laura advantage on  matt which actually you are immune to fear so it does not affect you however it shakes the  interior and you watch as small stones thud hitting the /none/

/dung/ theyre all sixes  ashley we choose to kill this celestial baby not because it is easy but because it is hard  matt so as you land gently on the ground after plummeting head over heels thuds fire blast  holding your holy symbol before you you watch as this beam of condensed divine energy rockets  across and this tiny floating withered planar baby fire blast gets blasted you watch as the  wings get pushed back its holding itself in place but you see the dark shadow outline as the  energy is blasting through it as /none/ it hits its wings recoil and its still floating there but  you can see this sparkly outline of divine energy because the next attack on it has advantage  ashley do i still have a bonus action  matt you do your swords still up  ashley ill use the spiritual weapon

movement to earthglide to them  matt whats your speed  marisha i think 60 earthglide  matt 60 earthglide yeah totally youre moving into melee with the baby  marisha okay can i come up from underground grab them and then /none/ beat them into the ground  matt sure go ahead and roll a slam attack  taliesin puny god  matt make two slam attacks so roll twice its plus eight to attack each time  marisha thats cocked natural 20 on that one and a four on a second one which is 12  matt yeah that misses  marisha okay but that one is a natural 20  matt as you reach up out of the ground from underneath impact noise your fingers clasp  around the celestial baby and whack slam it into the ground as hard /none/ as you can go ahead and roll  damage on that 2d8 plus five so roll the 2d8  marisha and then you double the 2d8  matt you double whatever you rol for the 2d8 and then add plus five crit that baby its our next  tshirt crit that baby  marisha six doubled which is 12 plus five doubled which is ten so thats 22  matt the bonus isnt doubled just the dice  marisha i know just the dice is 22 plus five so 27  matt thats great 27 points of damage wham slamming /none/ onto the ground as your hand retracts  up you can see the wings are as it starts to fly up it gasps  marisha and i just want to hold onto it and be like yo yo air elemental and then let my air  elemental come over and do its thing double slam attack  matt go for it  marisha slam attack no im going to do a multi attack two slam attacks so 2d8 plus eight once  again thats an 18 and a 17 plus eight  matt 18 and 17 plus eight  marisha /none/ yeah so 26 and 25  matt both hit go ahead and roll damage  marisha which is 3d8 plus two so the first one oh six seven eight plus seven which is 15  for the first one 15 plus two 17 and then the second one is eight plus two fives which is 18  plus two so 20  matt nice  taliesin and he gets flung in a random direction  matt no this was just hitting it impacts all righty thats the end of your turn all right as  it comes back to the /none/ entitys turn its looking really really rough and as part of that its  going to reach into itself its hands push into its torso and as it screams raspy scream it  gives out this horrible scream as it tears some of its chest open and from the inside where you  imagine it would be a ribcage its this impossibly bright light that echoes out in a  shockwave affecting everybody except for vex actually i need everybody else to make a  constitution saving throw  taliesin all of us  matt yes  sam oh boy /none/ that dont look good  taliesin we dont have advantage on this do we  matt nope  taliesin im going to burn a resolve  marisha constitution thats part of my physical stats as being an elemental correct its con  strength and dex never mind yeah  matt so  sam 22  matt 22 that succeeds  taliesin 17  marisha 15  liam 24  matt that succeeds pike  ashley 11  matt okay  travis 25  matt succeeds everyone who succeeds you suffer 48 points of radiant damage  sam radiant damage  /none/ matt yes  liam 48 on a success whoa  matt if you failed you took 96 points of radiant damage  taliesin wait thats magical i have advantage the cloak wouldnt  matt the cloak doesnt say a spell effect  taliesin against spells and other magical effects  matt technically because its not a leveled spell its just a radiant blast it would not  affect it  taliesin it wouldnt have given me advantage on that save  matt no it wouldnt  ashley 96 you said  matt 96 points of radiant damage so keyleth i /none/ need you your elemental has gone berserk  marisha theres no way  matt aside of rolling a 20 go for it just try  marisha unless i roll a nat 20 they just do their own thing if you fail  travis what do you got to roll a 20 percy bless that shit  matt even so im letting you have this opportunity  marisha i rolled a 19  matt nope so as the conjure elemental spell fails the control of your elemental shifts and  now its aggressively turning its attention towards you and the rest /none/ of your party  marisha can i not fade it after this oh i can drop concentration on it  and then it will go away right  matt no thats not how this works  travis did you just put  liam a new enemy on the map  sam a new opponent enters  marisha to be fair didnt it also get affected by the blast  matt yeah actually roll a constitution saving throw for the air elemental its a plus two  marisha i rolled a 13 plus two so 15  matt the air elemental /none/ is actually destroyed to your advantage strangely  marisha it only has 90 hit points so its fine guys its fine  matt all right so the entity looks like its barely hanging on and you see parts of its  internal body falling out from where it tore its chest open its going to use a bonus action to  misty step out of this vicinity over to here its going to use its movement to fly high up almost  trying to escape the cavern now its up in that region right there well say here on top /none/ of  this turn that away  laura oh look how teeny i can finally see it  ashley above a fountain  liam its a faerie dragon  laura its so teeny  matt all righty vex youre up  laura i guess ill fly up so i can see over the wall i have no idea whats going on  matt you fly up and you see everyone below is wrecked the ground is charred with some sort of a  radiant blast you watched it flash over the wall itself like a small rapid recreation of the /none/  intro of akira boom this big arcing ball of white energy  laura wow can i hunters mark the baby  matt sure  laura and then im going to try to shoot the baby with my blazing bowstring that would be a 30 and  im going to make it a bramble shot  matt okay  liam ball of vines in the air  laura dc of 17  matt strength  laura yeah  matt i actually rolled a natural 17  laura motherfucker okay well  matt but it still takes the damage  laura /none/ still 4d8 extra well 17 plus five is 22 plus eight is 30 plus two is 32 plus 1d6  lightning damage 35 plus 1d6 for hunters mark is 40  matt 40 nice so as it hits you watch as the brambles try and wrap around it but it actually  flies free  laura oh wait plus the blazing bowstring another two fire damage  matt 42 total you can see more of its just falling out of its small decomposing torso and  its trying to fly upward now towards the light its on the edge  /none/ laura i want to try to do the same thing again  matt okay go for it  laura with a blazing bowstring again 28  matt 28 hits roll damage  laura okay bramble shot again because i get two motherfucker thats ten for my blazing  bowstring oh jesus h

baby we shall feast tonight thats so gross  and i just shoot the baby  matt all right as you pull back as its fluttering up you take aim and release and as  the arrow strikes it you can see the same way the dagger hit the baby it hits it and throws  it the sheer force of the arrow against the wall and pins it there like its stapled to the rock  as it reaches over to try and pull the arrow out and it begins to suddenly the arrow whoosh  breaks into a /none/ bunch of bramble vines that begin to wrap around it and you watch as the tiny baby arm  and wing try and reach out choking as it constricts and twists and slowly constrains it  until you see it crack pop and go limp on the inside of the vines and as the vines unfurl what  was physically there is slowly dissipating into a glitterlike powder the body dissipating and  falling apart  laura i mean it was an evil baby right  travis yeah nobody likes glitter  marisha yeah glitter gets everywhere  laura should /none/ we get out of here  travis muffled i dont mean to be rude  marisha i run over to grog im still an elemental yeah i am still an elemental  where is he  matt you dont know actually  sam i saw it ill point down  marisha you

 marisha i dont want to /none/ kill him by suffocating  matt no hes fine he can hold his breath for six minutes hes got a really high constitution  so youre fine you slowly pummel the rock out from his way and pull grog out from the interior  of the stone floor  taliesin yeah we should head out and bug bomb the place  travis dont we need proof  taliesin grab the body lets go  sam theres no body  marisha i go over to the glitter and i get some of my potion bottles from my alchemy to  oh /none/ im actually good at this i try and harvest some sweep some glitter  matt okay so you gather some glitter in  taliesin really quick just look around is there anything of value to grab before we run  matt make an investigation check  sam ill look too  laura while shes doing that can i just look over the ground and see  if theres any platinum deposits  sam we could do a quick mining  matt i mean there are a number of visible edges of veins  liam is there 230000 gold worth  /dung/ sam probably we could stay here for a couple months  matt in this whole mine theres a lot of platinum but you have to mine it and as you guys  are having this moment you begin to hear the loud sound of hundreds of large insectlike creatures  climbing their way down the walls  laura oh god get to the middle and get in the air  marisha okay so i get everybody in the middle is everyone ready  travis i need help  taliesin we pulled you out  marisha what do you mean you /none/ need help  travis im on the other side of the 40foot wall from the carpet  marisha i go boom and i pull grog through  laura no the carpet we just got to get the carpet i can go down and grab the carpet  marisha oh the carpet i take a few minutes as my earth elemental self to beast through  laura we dont have a few minutes  marisha i can do double damage to structures  laura you dont have to do that i can go get the carpet im right there  marisha /none/ oh okay go get the carpet  matt okay so you rush over and grab the carpet and you guys begin to make  your way back up through  laura are we bamfing out or are we flying up  taliesin i think were flying up and if we see anything well just take shots at anything thats  rolling around if anything is visible lets just do damage on our way out  marisha oh were doing damage as we fly out  liam or we could tree stride out  taliesin we cant tree stride theres no /dung/ trees  laura or we can plane shift  matt there is a small tree growing out of the side of the wall from where you killed the  creature but its not large enough for that spell  laura but still really cool  matt yeah it grows and twists out like a bonsai curves upward  laura i hope that it slowly becomes a forest underground  travis theyre going to chop it down as they mine the platinum  matt all right so you guys are coasting up through the shaft  marisha oh are we just /none/ riding up  travis straight up  marisha broom and carpet broom and carpet  matt okay you guys begin heading up through the center column of this opening as youre moving  up are you staying in the darkness  laura can you daylight or something like up and out  marisha i can do we need to  taliesin you know at this point it might be  marisha on the top of my spire i cast daylight  matt okay so boom this light now emerges from this area and as you can see now through this /none/  cavern around you theres about a dozen or so of these large ankheg creatures about every 30 feet  or so 40 feet up youre in the center of you look up and you can see easily the hundred that  you saw earlier have all been drawn to the surface by the screams of this creature and as you begin  rocketing up with this daylight spell you watch as some of them start hanging upward in your  direction you start hearing this sound hiss  marisha are they attracted to the daylight  matt theyre apparently /none/ attracted to your presence it is a line shot im going to go ahead  and have lets see here percy and vex i need you guys to both make a  constitution saving throw  travis oh shit oh god we did not pretty sure you said that last time before you turned into  chef boyardee  matt sorry sorry not constitution dexterity my

same thing  matt there are over a hundred and they take more than a few shots to go well say you start  picking them off a few as you go but you watch them fall past you theres just such a mass  number of them as you /none/ guys get up another 40 or so feet spray sound again from three different  ones all right i need taryon percival and vex again to make dexterity saving throws  sam natural

further youre about halfway up this tunnel at this point and now  youre getting to the heavy cluster of /none/ these creatures at this point a large cluster of them  begin to spray all across i need all of you guys to make two dexterity saving throws anybody get  lower than a 13  taliesin nope  ashley and travis i did  matt for one  travis for the second one  marisha lower than a 13  matt yeah

pikeypants  ashley yeah im fine  travis im okay  matt as youre shooting and you hear the gunfire gunshots going off you fire the arrows more  and more of these ankhegs are falling and crumbling off

of it  vax pike and grog the three of you guys roll dexterity saving throws please  travis 12  /none/ liam 19  ashley 18  travis 12  matt all right six points of acid damage six points of acid damage

sam what is pike riding on  matt shes on the carpet  ashley im on the carpet im okay  laura you should heal yourself  ashley i know  marisha can i /none/ do a wind wall to protect us from around us  matt wind wall is stationary it might help with one round of the spray  marisha are we doing one more round  matt youll find out you dont know  marisha if we are i will prep my wind wall spell to encompass us for one more round  matt okay as you guys are heading upward now youre about threequarters of the way out the  numbers are thinning a little bit they start spraying once more you go ahead and create a wind  wall that /none/ youve been preparing as you watch these jets of extremely acidic burning liquid  shoot toward you suddenly a column of wind gets conjured upward from the darkness and deflects the  spray into a mist that is thrown back against the wall harmlessly youre almost to the exit and  you see a handful more towards the very top of this cavern keyleth percy and pike make a  dexterity saving throw if you can  sam pikey  marisha im good 21  taliesin im going to burn a reroll its the end of my resolves  ashley /dung/ oh natural 20  taliesin ten  matt okay so eight points

you can watch  as the creatures are starting to skitter out from the edges but you are far above and a few of them  are spraying but youre above the range and its coasting over and disappearing below youve now  emerged into /none/ the night sky the moonlight above you youre all fairly beaten  taliesin is there anything we can throw down there to really piss them off  sam ill drop a bead of firewall  marisha yeah and i can drop a fireball on there  sam im sorry a wall of fire  matt youre going to throw a wall of fire on the edge of it  sam yeah  marisha yeah and ill throw a fireball burn

matt ill pull it up real fast  ashley oh it does say  laura 60 feet in diameter no you can make a straight wall of 100 feet or 60 /none/ feet in diameter  ashley yeah ringed wall up to 60 feet  matt okay so you can make a wall around the one side of it not the whole thing  sam wall of fire around the other  matt you dont get to get the whole radius but between the wall of fire and the bladed wall you  blast the opening there you coast away watching and hearing as dozens of ankhegs that are climbing  up to the top begin to screeching eventually they all begin to burrow back into the rock and  stone and /none/ vanish the ones on the surface begin to burrow below and a calm stillness comes over the  exterior of the mines as you all coast up hundreds of feet in the air over the forest  licking your wounds so you removed the glitter and you removed  laura the little coffin  matt the little stone placard you had to wedge it out but you got it up there  laura okay  matt and thats where well call it for the night  travis nice  marisha that was awesome  taliesin im at 57 hit points /none/ yay  travis add 100 to that and thats somewhere grog  taliesin where were you at i feared for you

something that attacks via the terrain instead of  ashley was he an evil baby  laura yeah was it evil or could we have saved it  matt the actual title for it is symphior the withered planetar it was essentially a celestial  seed that was placed to eventually emerge as a guardian in a future time almost a ragnaroktype  circumstance but the land around it became corrupted as it gestated or was held in stasis  and then was awoken prematurely and as such /none/ became this horrible monstrous version of what it  was supposed to be it was neutral but it was dangerous it seemed pretty far gone thank
