/none/  matt of critical role  yelling  laura oh god i got to  sam were not out were not out  travis were not  screaming  ♪  electricity crackling  ♪  matt hello everyone and welcome back  so get you up to speed  with whats recently happened in our game  vox machina our band of adventurers  have been traveling across taldorei  continents and planes of existence beyond  in search of the vestiges of divergence  magical artifacts that can help outfit them  for their coming struggle against the /none/ chroma conclave  a group of chromatic dragons that had terrorized  and conquered the taldorei countryside  for quite some time now  at the end of this venture  youve all acquiring your relics of power  your levels of experience  and the allies youve amassed through this journey  converged upon the central capitol city of emon  in hopes of finally defeating  and destroying thordak the cinder king  you made a tenuous relationship  with a member of the conclave  raishan the diseased deceiver the green dragon  and after killing the /none/ other three members of the conclave  you went in with armies at your back  ashari in the sky  who laid siege to the city  as you snuck beneath the streets of emon  emerging on the outskirts of the cloudtop district  through the help of your two allies zahra and kashaw  you managed to bypass two waiting fire giants  push straight into the center  of the mostly ruined cloud topped district  where you confronted thordak the cinder king  in his large swollen powerful primordial red dragon form  shivers  /none/ laura sorry  taliesin i was with you travis gross  matt its a favored enemy right  just checking  you came prepared with with allies at your sides  and full power you tore into thordak  and while many blows were sustained  on both sides of the fray  thordak fell on the battlefield  in those moments as thordak attempted  to retreat into his lair  you vax gave chase and slew the dragon  using whisper in your grasp  as a few of you came up behind raishan as well  asked /none/ as part of the accord you had made  to be given some time with the corpse of thordak  it was decided that this was not to be allowed  she was not to be trusted and an attack was made on raishan  though raishan also had made  a few unique choices of her own leading up to it  this led to a confrontation in thordaks lair beneath the city  where you all nearly got  your asses handed to you  by by a wellprepared raishan  however in the midst of this battle /none/  you did summon your ally jmon sa ord  theyre the leader of ankharel  the distant city on the continent of marquet  and a brass dragon who upon arriving in this fray  full health and ready to fight  was enough of a threat to drive raishan off  in her damaged form before she could finish you off  in your the state you were in  sam so it was worth it  taliesin yeah it was definitely worth it  laura yeah  taliesin yeah it was worth it  matt however you /none/ were then kept at bay  by a wall of force as raishan took two  of thordaks strangely existing eggs  and flew into a tunnel towards the corpse of thordak  and then disappeared in a flash of purple energy  before the wall dropped  and you all just arrived halfway through the tunnel  where the corpse of thordak once lay  to find it missing along with raishan  and the eggs that she had gathered  and that was where we had left off  so as the rest of your party begins running /none/ up  winded bloodied and still reeling  from the intensity of the battle you just fought  you have the intense heat of a nearby cavern  the hints of of cracked redhot earth and rock  that are kind of protruding in small sections  the sweat just pouring down your face  you run up and you can see the trail  the pool of blood that once was driven by the wounds  left by your blade at the side of thordaks corpse missing  the impact crater of thordaks landing  still carved into the /none/ side of this curved tunnel  you see as kima rushes up  out of breath you see gilmore rush up  and push his hair  out of his face  and theres a moment of silence  as you all kind of take in what has just transpired  what do you want to do  travis using my magic can i detect  which direction the beast fled  matt no travis okay  i dont know anything  laura should we get i dont know  does it matter to get any of his blood  /none/ maybe we can track him easier  marisha yeah laura the body  sam thordaks blood  laura yeah thordaks blood  matt okay so you go ahead and you pull  do you have empty vials currently  laura i took a lot of potions so im assuming so  matt yes you would actually so yeah  so you take some of the the mostly  or completely emptied healing potion vials and collect  laura i lick i lick the bottle  for all the remaining healing  matt little straw laura like a caprisun  matt /none/ yeah exactly  okay  marisha i head back into the chamber  and see if i can find any of like  raishans scales or like raishan blood or  laura maybe give it a moment  just to let the lair actions die down a little bit  liam what  laura the you know all the lava stuff happening in there  marisha ill watch from a distance and make sure that you know  its not boiling over  laura its safe marisha yeah  liam im gonna limp up to you  youre burnt all /none/ over  marisha yeah liam hold still for a second  marisha that really sucks  i want to assume that was karma  yeah liam alright  i do have  marisha i feel really bad for that duergar now  that sucks  thats a rough way to go  laughter  liam i cover her mouth with my hand for a second  and use the last of lay on hands and i  i checked with critrolestats i do have ten left  matt okay  liam so im gonna use eight eight of those  /none/ to heal you up a bit  marisha okay laura eight whole points  liam i only got ten laura romeo  what do you do with those last two  taliesin i just imagine like light slapping  in the face just eight times  pow hit point hit point  marisha lay on hands lay on hands  liam one two three four five six  matt the oath of annoyance paladin  coming soon in the taldorei campaign book  liam thordak died like this  laughter  matt alright so as vax heals you up  /none/ with some of the remnants of his divine power still  still in his body  kimas kind of walking up to keyleth  and gilmore goes over and starts helping you  gather and separate some of the  what little blood you can  a lot of its kind of just dug into the  the rock and the dust but there are a little bit  that you can kind of pull into it  its not too clustered and filled  with the equivalent of coffee grinds  what else are you guys doing  taliesin /none/ once the lair is safe i want to get in and start examining it  marisha same laura yeah  matt okay  it takes id say probably a good two minutes  or so before the  the general tremors of the lair begin to subside  the presence of thordak being long enough removed  that the volcanic activity begins  to come to a small gentle end  laura actually before we go back in  can i peek up on the surface level  and see if it looks like the fighting has died down  /none/ liam i was just about to say the same  matt uh okay you guys go up there  laura yeah liam yeah  matt okay  everyone else staying down  travis yep same yeah  matt okay while you guys are waiting  the two of you rush up to the surface  the outside of the opening to thordaks lair  both of you guys make perception checks  travis dont die  laura twentyseven liam twentynine  matt okay  as you both peek through the  the heated clouds of soot and ash  that /none/ are billowing out from inside  your vision clarifies and you can see up into the sky  the thunderstorm that has been encompassing  the vicinity of emon  its still rolling and firing off  bolts of lightning and thunder  imitates thunder clap  in the distance  it is beginning to slowly subside  to the size that it began  but you also notice that the wyvern riders  that once rapidly swung through the air  are all retreating en masse  the few that still remain into the southwest end of  now /none/ maybe about a half mile off emon  and a number of them are fleeing  and catching up with them  it looks like theyre being fended off  and the tides at least have turned somewhat  from where they began here in emon  you also do notice that the  the two doors that you guys originally entered  that you pushed through  one of the doors is now pushed off of its hinges  and has fallen to the ground  the other is kind of partway off that  that giant gate doorway /none/ and just beyond it  you see what looks to be battle still ensuing  you hear the muffled screams echoing from outside that gate  and streets beyond in emon of hundreds of soldiers  shouting into battle  large heaving war cries of deep voiced giantkin  you see bursts of flame in the distance  and what looks to be bodies  occasionally flung through the air  to disappear past the horizon beyond the gate top  this there is still warfare raging in this city  liam can we see through that gate to where /none/ we parted with kashaw  matt from this distance you cannot get that much more  you can just see the motion of  you have to get closer  laura so we cant can i reach into my shirt  and grab out that note that was on the arrow  i never read it  matt oh yeah laura what is it  matt it says my gift to you darling use it well  laura oh i knew it  we have to find them  liam lets go look  just a look laura just stealth /none/  to see if it looks like the giant is gone  and if zahra and kash are around  liam why dont we just cover like half the distance  see what we can see from there laura yeah yeah yeah  matt okay stealth check both you guys  ♪  liam twentyeight  ♪  laura twelve  matt wow laura i know  matt okay  laura im you know ive im injured grievously  matt you are  you snatched from the jaws of death temporarily  you find yourself physically affected  more than /none/ you would have expected  and what seemed to you as just an instant of darkness  and as you begin to try and follow after your brother  you find yourself stumbling and falling to one knee  and trying best to keep up  laura oh shit  matt at this time you notice two figures  running from the opening in that gate in your direction  you see it first but you see it for a moment after him  you see bloodied bruised but still in a full sprint  both kashaw and zahra rushing /none/ in your direction  and you hear kash just yelling out  vox machina  youre alive right  laura keep it down you fuck  come on come on into this hole  matt hole yes the hole darling  right  and they both rush up  and as you guys are catching up with them  you notice by the gate pushing through  what looks to be another fire giant  wielding a sword kind of dragged behind  kind of pour through  yells  and just begins going into a  a large bounding /none/ sprint in your direction  laura oh god liam running  laura giants giants at the door  giants taliesin i am moving towards it  travis yeah now were all going on up towards the hole  matt okay laura can i shoot an arrow at him  matt as youre saying giants into your ear  you watch as two crossbow bolts kinda  into the back of the head of the giant and giant goes  and stops and looks over the shoulder  and you see a flash of light behind him  an impact into /none/ the back of the black ironed giants armor  like a sudden impact of a fiery meteor just slams into it  yells  and the giant stumbles to one knee  before another blow hits him right across  the back of the head and the fire giant  just falls on face first unconscious onto the ground  little cloud of dust and dirt kind of billows up to the sides  there you see by the front of the gate  you see jarret with crossbow right there and standing  and now stepping up onto the /none/ back of the giants armor  and slamming a flashing bright radiant war hammer  into the back of its neck  you see in chain mail  long beard white streaked  billowing war torn hair pulled into  a tight ponytail towards the back  a familiar face  you see kerrek currently of white  of westruun standing wipes his brow  and looks up and takes notice of your presence immediately  patrick if you want to come on the stage  laura what the fuck  applause cheers  sam geez louise patrick rothfuss  /none/ laura scooch on by since its so easy to make your way  laughing  matt our set is so conducive to movement  travis oh  i didnt break it  laura the whole set falls down matt i know  laura kerrek you can fight  patrick i get to sit next to my besty  marisha yeah  my new besty  liam what in the fuck laura i thought you were  i thought you can fight  patrick uh  laura uh yeah you just brought down a giant no big deal  patrick uh /none/ team effort  like is everything cool now  like is this the last of them  matt for one i think you might want to move a little bit over  to get into the camera  travis yes come on over  matt just a smidge for the audience  laura yeah liam yeah yeah  matt there you go  and as youve been in this fray for quite some time  and the exhaustions starting to mount on you a bit  and the  the two individuals that you and your  your allies have /none/ come upon being the smaller unit  you manage to penetrate further into the city  then the main armies that were pushing towards the gates  you saw the goldenarmored human  and the tiefling currently struggling with  what looked to be five fire giants  three that had come up behind the two that they had ensnared  and after minutes of battle  and tearing through them  it looks like you finally gain the upper hand  youve lost a number of allies through this  this incursion however  these are the really really /none/ familiar welcome faces  given the perpetual onslaught that youve seen  since you first arrived in emon  patrick hehe probably just says  is it done  laura is it  patrick thats his thats his opener  laura i mean eh  liam ish  laura thordak was killed  matt kashaw pipes up and says so you killed the thing  you killed it its dead right  laura mmhmm  matt please tell me you killed the thing  laura yes the thing is dead  liam we killed thing laura and gone  literally /none/ gone  matt great laura stolen  matt fantastic thats thats wonderful great  we can go home patrick stolen  laura can i hug zahra  matt yeah she she eagerly puts her arms out  and as you guys kind of embrace real fast  she kind of both of you almost from the impact  stop the bruising sets in  matt darling careful laura yeah yeah i know darling  injured  patrick how how do these guys look  matt you dont see them yet you just see these two  and after a moment /none/ of these hugs happen  you kind of catch your breath  you notice a few more figures appear  from out of this large craterous hole in the ground  in the center of this ruined district  and from there you watch as the familiar percival  scanlan oh no you stay behind  grog and keyleth all emerge from the hole  patrick hows she look  sam whoo  matt a little a little singed a little burned  a little worse for wear but alive  cant say that much different  from the rest /none/ of her allies as well  patrick okay  i might actually kind of lumber a little bit in that direction  as if i were going in for a hug and then stop when i remember  that maybe im not that sort of person  laughter  it looks it looks actually very awkward  laughter  taliesin oh good  this is this is a face i would like to see  marisha kerr  laura he just killed a giant with his  giant hammer of blazing white  marisha keyleth just closes the distance  /none/ and runs up and just hugs kerr  patrick big bear hug big bear hug  marisha what are you doing here  patrick same as everyone  been doing doing as much as a person can do  marisha i got your gift  patrick im so glad of that  marisha it meant everything patrick oh  marisha maybe even a little too literally like  like 20 minutes ago  a lot of passing through fire here lately  patrick yeah  taliesin to break the awkward briefly dear  travis yeah much war still happening  /none/ laura maybe we should go down taliesin wait  marisha i sky write up in the air is there like a  like a sigil of emon  like a  matt i mean there is a crest for the city  you can do a simplified version of it if you like  marisha i do that into the sky with sky write  matt okay so the storm which is still raging  but its moving itself southwest to almost follow the  the wyvern riders that have survived this battle so far  and are fleeing from /none/ the scene  the clouds then begin to shift and shape  and the darkness separates into what looks like  little plumes of white  that spell out a very basic rendition of the symbol of emon  ♪  what else you wanna do  travis is kash there  matt kash is there with you guys  travis hows he look taliesin yeah  matt he looks pretty messed up  there are a few large sections of armor  that have been just cloven through  and you see a number of flesh wounds sustained  /none/ but nothing mortal but he  he holds himself with a kind of a  knowing confidence with his arms crossed  but as soon as any sort of physical movement  there is a little bit of a wheeze  and a trying to cover for the physical impact  of the battle hes just sustained  travis you look a little worse for the wear there  matt i dont know what you mean im sorry  travis oh im sorry z did he go unconscious  matt actually no he fought quite bravely  travis are you /none/ lying matt no  travis shit marisha shes lying  travis good job i guess kash  matt he goes you didnt too bad yourself big man  smacks you on the shoulder and goes  whimpering  travis no that would never hurt me  liam im gonna walk up to him as well  cause he looks fucked up and say  hey thank you for the assist spanky  and im gonna give him two slaps of the cheek  and leave a couple of black feathers stuck there  with sweat and use the last of /none/ my lay on hands on him  taliesin now that now that weve sent the word maybe now  indistinct talking  the conversations underground  marisha okay  liam everything hurts  matt whats your armor class  liam twentyone  matt he knees you gently enough in the nuts  to get you to drop to one knee  travis gently enough  matt thats two  laughter  travis yes good throwback  liam i laugh through it  travis good callback  taliesin are there are there any soldiers  running around by the way  /none/ right now any of our people  matt right now some soldiers are beginning to pour in  through the gate that they emerged from  some of your allies some from other armies  that are starting to find their way  towards the center core of the city  not everyones been made aware that the  the center of this battle  has already been won essentially  travis damn it  matt so people are starting to come in  and calm down a bit and then rush back out  to see what else is /none/ there  you watch as a few wyvern riders try and scoot through the sky  to catch up with the rest of them as a bolt of lightning  slams into one and you see it  yells  streak and tumble and then crash somewhere  on the outside of the district  taliesin im gonna fire a couple of times into the air  just to get some attention and just  spread the word thordak has fallen  spread the word  now we can go down  matt you see some of the soldiers immediately /none/  kind of look at each other and you can hear the  sound of the shouting and whispering back and forth  voices are shouting thordak has fallen thordak has fallen  thordak has fallen  it starts just carrying throughout the city and echoing  marisha call the locksmith  matt everyone goes what  sorry thordak has fallen  laughter  so as you you follow them  and gather into the area or you want to  patrick id say just as and i have to go talk  im like samantha its you  circle /none/ everyone up  make sure the people are taken care of  matt yes  patrick and its just like 30  sam another campaign going on  lots of campaigns have just briefly touched  patrick its a couple a couple dozen  moderately well armored  but you know like  these these are not maybe crack troops  they have a lot of heart  liam do they have any hit points  patrick more than you might expect  yeah and so i just i square them away  they can take care of themselves by /none/ now  at least for a bit  matt yeah they set up a small perimeter  to the entrance ways to the district  and are awaiting other forces to arrive  and inform them of whats going on  and still stay alert for any stragglers of the battle  liam what a world what a world  matt as you whatd you do  marisha i just i grab kerr and i start ushering him down into the hole  patrick okay  marisha into the hole  matt laura  laura im so sorry  matt /none/ you are youre my favorite 13 year old  patrick its its a lovely hole  laughter  liam thats what they tell me matt theres room for everyone  patrick its been a long time for me you know  i havent done this recently  liam im in here all the time  all the time  matt while this is happening scanlan  you stayed down there with kima and gilmore  sam yeah i sort of moseyed my way back to the beginning  to the opening of the lair  like where i had tossed /none/ the flute  matt yeah  liam and i pick it up  and i carefully divide  my sachet of suude into three parts  three thirds  and im going to snort one third of it  matt okay  the large brass dragon that has currently  been heading at the end sam he can watch  they can watch they can watch they can watch  matt at the end of the tunnel devossa  theyve slowly brought down to their hands and knees  after travelling through and scoping out  the interior of the /none/ lair  approaches you as youre pulling out your stash and you know  gilmore and kima approaching as well  what have you there  sam ive had a  not a great day devossa  thank you for coming  for answering our call  i just need a second to myself if you dont mind  laura isnt pike still down there  matt technically pike would still be down there with him  sam maybe just turn a wing  laughter  matt they give a curious glance  as gilmore kind of walks up  /none/ and brushes his hair back  which it catches your eye interestingly  there is like a glowing rune of some kind  in the center of gilmores forehead  he kind of brushes the hair out of the way and he goes  if a man wants some privacy give him some privacy  i just want to ask you a few questions  its not very often i get to talk to  jmon  and gilmore walks up as the dragon sits back up  and puts out a claw and kind of lifts gilmore into his /none/ claw  they both begin having a conversation back and forth  which at this point pike is also curious  and begins to pay attention  and sidles up next to you  as you begin divvying out and goes  sam are they talking in their language  the marquet language or  matt if you want to listen in  sam no no im just curious  matt marquesian and yes they are  sam exciting taliesin i dont speak that  matt as you begin taking it out  and youre getting ready to go ahead /none/ and snort one portion  sam one third  matt one third of your suude  pike approaches from behind  and claps her gauntlet onto your shoulder and says  scanlan you okay  sam oh yeah i just  this is some some healing herbs that i got  matt okay well if i im trained in  in medicinal applications if you need my help  laughter  sam i put it away  laughter  travis pike cures all  matt she looks over towards kima  and kima is now approaching the rest of you /none/ guys  and walking into the lair  and theyre feeling out the vicinity  to see if the lair actions have come to a halt  and made it safe  and so pike begins shouting out orders like  alright we have to make a perimeter  make sure theres no other exits  make sure theres no  nothing else waiting for us in this cavern  im giving orders to a dragon  you dragon  help us do a perimeter please  and kind of interrupting the conversation  between devossa and gilmore  the /none/ brass dragon turns the head down  well if you insist small one  and sets gilmore back down  onto the center of the lair floor and  they just begin to walk perimeter  as pike joins up and you are still left alone in the tunnel  should you be so inclined  sam alright ill whip it out again  laughter  matt make an intelligence check if you dont mind  just add your intelligence  sam oh not good taliesin wow  laura youre gonna put it in your butt  laughter  sam /dung/ six matt six  travis six total  matt okay  this looks exactly like the kind of substance  you should be snorting for use  so you you take a bit of the suude and this  this particular suude taking a closer look at it  the grains of it and its like  almost like a  like a brown sugar type texture to it  it is a dark brown color to it  it looks like a crystallized dirt almost  and you kind of like take take a second look around  sniffs /none/  it burns  it burns  oh man does it burn  it burns a lot and youre like  groaning  sam no effect  matt it burns thats an effect  sam okay  i take out the flute  i pack some in the front of it  laughter  matt this is how you treat relics  that were gifted to you by the leader of a foreign nation  by turning the expended energy into a makeshift pipe  sam im taking another third  and im packing it in the front of the /none/ flute  travis oh please let it be  talking over each other  free basing so  talking over each other  sam i will dip a torch into a bit of lava to light it  laughter  and i am going to bong rip  from this ancient brass flute  laughter  matt alrighty  i need you to make a constitution saving throw  laura what are you doing  sam constitution saving matt constitution saving  laura constitution saving throw matt constitution saving throw  sam not good  laughter  eight matt eight /none/  roll 1d4  sam here we go here we go  three  matt as you inhale deeply  as opposed to the burning sensation  from when you decided to snort the granules  the smoke and mist that emerges  as it fills your lungs actually has a  a very fine herbal taste to it almost and it is warm  and theres a head rush immediately that hits you  you feel for a moment your vision kind of crystallize  and clarify all of a sudden  all the colors become briefly brighter  /dung/ and you feel this slight pulse of  of energy whenever you cast a spell  like the fingers kind of warm at the tips  and you feel the immediate need  to just practice something  right before your vision gets blurry and dark  as  yeah thats it the rest of you guys  the rest of you guys come walking down the tunnel  being careful you know  weapons out but talking  kind of getting up to speed with whats transpired  you look in the distance and you can see within the /none/ lair  and youre seeing this its a down  a decline into this large heavy tunnel  that is just made of volcanic rock  and blackened stone with occasional cracks of  of melting rock that are just spilling through  and these small orange glowing pockets  into this large central underground cavern  that has an entire pool of molten rock  that is kind of spiraling through portions of the floor  there is a large brass dragon  just casually strolling around the opposite side  huge gargantuan in size strolling around  and /none/ a few other humanoid individuals  and you guys watch as a singular male gnome ally  is face down on the ground not moving  travis oh there was no one even in here  laura can i run up to him  matt yeah laura scanlan  smack him a couple times does he wake up  matt nope  laura can i roll him over  patrick probably get over there pretty quick too  its not that i dont think that these guys  can take of their own wounded but  matt yeah patrick yeah /none/  matt so you rush up and have both of you  make a medicine check right now  laura oh my god  sam this is everything  laughter  marisha great time for a personal crisis  great

killing him  patrick okay marisha fifteen  matt /none/ fifteen on investigation marisha yeah  matt yeah he smoked something out of this  laughter  marisha guys  i feel like this was a classic scanlan

downright ran  liam she did  travis i thought she teleported  taliesin ill miss you  laughter  travis where am i going  matt as this conversations happening  in the intensity of the emotions  you notice that gilmore  kima  and devossa the brass dragon  are all just kind of sitting watching  devossa has their hands kind of clasped  in front with /none/ their jaw resting on the edge  and just kind of watching  and the the dragons voice kind of billows up forth  ah the drama of such short lives  its heartwarming for us  who dont get the chance to see it often enough  its lonely in the tower

ankharel  and /none/ i can guarantee you the moment that i absconded  with your magic to aid you  thats the opening theyve been waiting for  so i have to return to my city and my people  but i believe our debt is collected  your victory against thordak complete  from where i once left it  i wish you luck  sam would you would you like  you lent me this symbol this necklace  necklace symbol  would you like it back  matt the large brass dragon face kind of shifts down  right up /none/ to you and the immensity to distance  is already intimidating  but when the front of the snarling jaws  the

this close  to the front of the dragons maw  the teeth curl into a grin  and the voice kinda billows out  like a slow rolling landslide into your face  with the warmth of its breath /none/  nah keep it  marisha jmon  matt and just steps over and starts  making its way up the hall  the cavern towards the district  marisha before you leave  if you were fighting a green dragon  named the diseased deceiver  who wanted ultimate power over her domain  where would you start  matt in my opinion  entities that are this intelligent  you never want to wait for them  to fight on their terms  travis good answer liam yeah  matt and the slow rolling impacts  of the /none/ dragons feet  grow quieter and quieter before you hear eventually  the wings lifting up and you see  as a cloud of smoke and ash

here that entire way  sam no i dont i dont think so  travis flash  sam maybe  laura i was joking i was joking  sam as terrible /none/ as this day has been  there is some gold at the end of the tunnel

go so well  patrick yeah how knocked about are they  i mean obviously singes and abrasions and  laura like really really knocked to shit  travis raise your hand if you have less than 30 /none/ hit

all take a moment  travis theres a lot of talking happening  i just wandered off  matt so as you guys begin to take the rests  tend to your wounds take a breather  and begin to mentally prepare yourself  for whatever the next stage of /none/ your journey is  grog you step out into the cavern  now without the red in your eyes  that normally calls to combat where your focus is on  what you can hurt and kill as soon as possible  now its what can loot and keep as soon as possible  and make an investigation check  travis okay gonna be high  oh 17 plus minus 2  fifteen matt fifteen  uh doesnt matter too much  as you walk in and begin taking in the surroundings  you can see there are edges of /none/ the cavern  that are just crammed with gold and platinum  and art fixtures and vases and golden brass and silver  keepsakes and knickknacks and decorations  you can see chains and candelabras  you can see all sorts  it looks like and you kind of  some of you gleaned this as you went in here  this is more wealth than youve ever seen  in your entire life  thisthis is probably a majority of the wealth  of emon that has been slowly brought to thordak  and forced into his lair as /none/ part of the tyranny  that he took over the city  so all the money here has been amassed  from the guilds from the villagers  from the townsfolk from the temples  from the shops from the cloudtop  this is the economy of emon  crammed into at least a majority of it  into a singular cavern  travis i feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of stuff  are there any like unique looking knickknacks  or really lovely or dangerous looking weapons  that grab my eye  because its just a lot /none/ of shit  matt well as based on your investigation check  which is a 15 um you do find a couple of fun things  you find a  travis i love it when he reaches for stuff  laura i know  matt you find a somewhat familiar looking metallic rod  about that long cylindrical  looks to have a couple of small almost ring divots on it  youre pretty sure you have one of these  laura immovable rod  travis what  sam immovable rod  travis yeah sam who has ours  laura /none/ i think i have it matt youve seen it  sam why dont we use that more  travis oh no no its not the same thing  laura ooh  marisha oh yeah youd be like climbing  travis this is different this is a movable rod  sam oh its a movable one not an immovable one  patrick just which means its just a rod  matt its just a rod basically  taliesin its a shake weight its a shake weight  laughing  it cant stop moving  liam you sullied dungeons and dragons  /none/ taliesin i would hope so  matt mind you that fighters forearms look amazing  so you pick that up and you start glancing through  and youre just kind of pushing through  some of the art objects  a large painting that just breaks in half  travis if theres a vase i would totally smash that  matt you smash a few vases actually  taliesin ironically there are two gold coins inside  laughing  matt um you also do see to the side  awhat looks to be a wooden box about that big  /none/ that is latched shut  it has beautiful engraving all across it  and what looks to be almost like gold leaf  with little gems of blue and red  kind of toward the corners  its a really beautiful artisan wooden box about that big  and then there is a large looks like a beautiful tapestry  that is rolled up and bound  travis okay thats boring  the box like does it look like its simple to open  matt uh you pick it up and look at it  it has a little latch /none/ on it  travis what would matt make an intelligence check  travis what would that guy thats always sneaking around do  intelligence check two minusyeah two okay  so zero matt zero  you shake it theres something inside it rattles around  its got a little heft to it  taliesin oh boy  matt you look at it try and pry open the side  nothing  travis even with the titanstone knuckles  it doesnt open  matt you want to use your strength  go and roll a strength check  travis yeah matt /none/ force it open  liam youre going to break a wonderful item  travis dammit  eleven  matt eleven okay  travis that was a low roll  matt uh you crssshh

pouch  it has a little top its buttoned shut  and it looks like theres something inside  almost /none/ like cards  marisha no no  travis yeah yeah open the sleeve the leather sleeve  patrick no  matt

/none/ fine material  it looks like its probably expensive  made of a very deep dyed navy blue silk  with looks to be a very very light tan pattern across it  as you unravel it its roughly six foot by nine foot  um it rolls out in front of you  laura do you fly fly  try to fly right now  go up in the air  spit  travis no patrick did you just spit on it  laura well thats my code word for my flying

thing i expected was grog  to be the first to loot for magical items  and roll a decent investigation check  and yet here /none/ you are discovering this deck  all right so  with this  you pull the card out and it looks like this beautiful  tarot like design of what looks like a metallic key  that is currently held aloft in space  behind what looks like almost like the stars  converging into some sort of a pattern in the night sky  travis thats good stars are nice  matt at this point  travis orion wouldnt fuck us  liam nope  patrick thats not a sword on his belt  matt as you pull the /none/ card and look at it  the card bursts into flames  and you feel this slight tingling in the hand  that held the card  suddenly you watch as theres a flash of light  within your grasp with what looks to be extending  from where the card once was  you immediately feel something steel in your hand  and as you clutch your fingers instinctually around it  and try to crush whatever it is  you look and watch as this beautiful looking scimitar  like blade is now in your grasp  travis /none/ oooh  whoa  matt its beautifully made an ornate hilt and hand guard  and it has like a chain dangling from the bottom of the pommel  that has looks like a small blue gem  its a beautiful looking piece of weaponry  and as you whip it back and forth  its perfectly balanced  travis does it make any noise when i swing it  laura a card turned into a sword  sam we should pull the other cards to see what swords theyll make  patrick you can do that 12 more times /none/  travis im apparently the most powerful sorcerer  that has ever lived  sam this is a deck of weapon cards  laura i mean seriously though  travis i have to hit something with it  laura well go hit something with it  travis is there like a tall statue around or anything  matt i mean you can see there are a few marble busts  and things that have been collected from the more  travis a marble bust is good thats perfect  taliesin please dont decimate the antiquities  travis can i pick /none/ it up  lob it  laura grog also dont forget this is property of emon  travis it just broke because you distracted me  laughing  ive got to go find another bust  is there another  matt there are a few yeah  travis thank god theres another  matt you need to recognize some of these used to exist  in the alabaster lyceum  these are actually busts of old heralded teachers  within the arcane halls of the lyceum  travis they wrote on stuff right matt yeah  travis okay then nobody /none/ cares what they looked like cool  take it and lob it in the air big swing  matt make an attack roll travis okay  can i make this a reckless attack  matt you can  taliesin is it a strength or dex weapon  matt its a strength weapon  taliesin ah  travis

16 okay  and with your gauntlets you have siege  which means you do double damage  against objects and structures  so as you take the sword back  you strike the edge of this bust  and watch it just turn to gravel and dust  pshhh it just shatters and explodes out /none/ the side  with one singular swing  and you watch as the small chunks of rock  that still somewhat resemble any sort of you know  sculptured structure go scattering across the black  you know lava and magma encrusted darkened floor  of the cavern  blade is untouched  travis it is really well balanced that is  and i just hold it up to my ear  laughing  matt a moment passes  a second moment passes  travis were good laura yeah  travis were totally good  sam its a cool weapon /none/  travis it is yeah  and i stealthily try and pocket the other cards  laura what are you doing  travis but i havent showered in a few days and my bum itches  matt make a slight of hand check grog  laughing  travis shit thats a natural 1  laughing

magical touch  sam im gonna look at it and just see if i happen  to know anything about it  matt roll an arcana check  sam i dont know anything about it  i rolled a 12 do i know anything about it  matt mmm theyre apparently magical  taliesin twenty three /none/  matt twenty three you being a studious child  and reading many things youve heard rumors  you have heard myths  you have heard legends

they can make a lot of things  sam can they make bad things  taliesin they can make a lot of bad things  sam /dung/ and do you know what activates them  just looking at a card  taliesin if i recall it doesnt take much  laura i just shut the little case and stuff it in my  sam lets keep it  taliesin i was going to say lets put it somewhere  where no one will ever find it  but that will be fine for now  travis may may ii actually i found that  laura oh grog thats sweet  travis but i dont i want to hold on to it its mine  laura no  /none/ travis you can keep all the other gold  laura yeah no i

user  laura maybe theres another set in here we should find it  travis and then you can have it  laura no if we find another set you can have it  liam thats a bad deal too  travis i go /none/ to look for another deck of many things  and nothing else  laughing  matt for all the gold that is in this cavern  none of it has any luster or shine to you  as your singularly focused on finding another one  of these deck of cards  you are throwing handfuls of platinum over your shoulder  travis garbage  rubbish filth  laughing  life has no luster to it anymore  you wretched  matt all right so continuing off of your investigation check  liam what a heart attack taliesin wow  /dung/ matt so you do have the deck of many things  which now has 12 cards in it  laura oh my god  taliesin ah  matt im gonna hand that to laura  sam next time i go back to casino im taking that with me  matt you doyou have that tapestry  you haveyou find what looks to be a pair of very fine  crafted dark green leather boots  that have almost a silver or platinum scrolling  along the edges of the leather  almost like leaves and branches  that tangle in /none/ towards the front of the foot  laura do they look elvish  matt it looks elvish in design  and you find what looks to be  a very very well crafted war hammer  it hasits shape and its design is  and only because youve seen this type of handle before  it appears to be dwarven in make  and it has a series of runes and glyphs  along the sides of the war hammer head itself  that seem to give you the sense  that this is a very expensive  or at /none/ least a very very elegantly crafted weapon  laura okay  sweet  i cant can i see if theyre magic i cant can i  matt i mean you can take the rest of your short rest  with one of the objects  to see if you can ascertain any sort of magic  or information about it  laura im gonna do that on the tapestry  matt okay  taliesin im with you laura fly fly for me  matt all right the rest of you guys  is there anything else should rest just healing /none/ up  taliesin healing up fixing my guns  and then sort of trying to navigate  some of this crazy in here  and then eventually looking around the cavern  to

ninety nine  laura one hundred  travis i didnt roll any cause i was looking through this  deck of many things 90 /none/  matt ninety okay  at the end of the short rest  vex youve taken the time with the tapestry  looking at it  its design kind of hurts your heart a little bit  cause it reminds you of the flying carpet that you once had  and youre like hoping and praying  and as itas youre concentrating on it  and hoping that something comes to you  youre like fly you know go  traverse carry  youre just throwing all these words out  and as youre just getting more and more exhausted /none/  and the rest of your party kind of look over  with this oh give it up girl kind of look  and shaking their head  a sudden hit of inspiration hits your mind  and clarifiesthe word lift  you say lift and the tapestry goes fll fll fll  laura shut the fucking  you guys  vax snoring  travis its a flying telefaphy  laura lift higher  ♪ high up in love ♪♪  sam another flying carpet  laura oh you

your broom can carry uh it /none/ can carry 400 pounds  at a flying speed of 30  laura well good so  matt sorry it can carry 400 pounds  but its flying speed becomes 30  while carrying over 200 pounds  laura okay  oh this is amazing  sam thats a good find  taliesin thats a very useful find laura this is some good stuff  marisha vex does it look like our old carpet  laura i mean it looks similar its a bit bigger  marisha does it looks like they were maybe in the same family  laura /none/ definitely keyleth marisha yeah  laura hey look at these boots  i throw them down to you  they look kind of druidish  marisha they do look druidish  do they look druidish  matt roll an arcana check marisha okay  ♪  five  matt they look pretty  marisha these are so pretty laura i know right  marisha oh my gosh  laura i think the color looks nice  it would look good with your dress  marisha okay ill look at these later  matt theyre nicer than the boots you have /none/ on  travis ooh thats a diss on your boots dog  marisha i well  matt they dont necessarily match the ensemble per se  but theyre nice boots  marisha the soles are a little melted now  laura i mean basically keyleth would be naked this whole time  cause all of her clothes would have burned off in the lava  matt this is the magical world of fantasy  in which characters dont suddenly lose all their clothing  or facial hair or body hair because of magical spells  laura all right sure whatever /none/  marisha sounds like that japanese rpg  cross talk  matt im sure there are rpgs out there  that let you do that  im sure lamentations of the flame princess  lets you do that  i think theres actually some exalted  expansions that let you do that  not this game  the fan artists take care of that for us  taliesin and with that yeah id love to take a look around the room  see if anything captures my eye  marisha i think also i think keyleths hair  would probably /none/ be shorter now again  thanks to the fire again  matt yeah sure  laura ooh can i fly up on the carpet  and see if anything catches my eye from above  matt sure you can jump up on the carpet  and get an aerial view  and as you get up towards the top if the cavern look over  laura not that i couldnt have done that on my broom  but i feel a little safer  cause theres stuff all around me  matt yeah its a nice big square patch just /none/ for you  laura im gonna lay down and  liam is there room for your broom on your carpet  laura yes  taliesin im gonna run on up there  and get a vantage point cause i still have some spider walk  matt you do yeah  laura hop on over perc  matt so you watch as percy kind of walks upside down  from on the cavern and kind of gets  a similar perspective as you  make an investigation check  sam not great  marisha thats real bad taliesin i cant pretend /none/  i cant pretend that thats sam real real bad  marisha thats pretty bad  taliesin why am i even bothering  six  matt yeah in all the time you spent here  most anything that catches your eye beyond just value  youve managed to scavenge and glean from the horde  everything else seems to be just collections  of expensive or valuable knickknacks  collectibles museum pieces  you know silverware furniture art pieces  gem collections and then gold silver platinum  itsyou knowing good amounts of money  you cant even fathom the /none/ scope of this  like this is  travis vex youre drooling  matt like millions of gold pieces  laura thats a lot  travis i feel like this is too much for anyone  laura no no no it is  we need to return this to the people of emon  i mean thats who this money came from  travis yeah but how do we do that  laura yeah marisha do you see anything  from greyskull in there  laura oh do i see anything from our keep  matt nothing that stands out /none/ or you would recognize  laura not that i can see  marisha all right  taliesin now well well take a tithing for ourselves  to help rebuild and then everything were gonna  have to post guards and someone is gonna have to take charge  of all this put it to a use rebuilding the city  make sure that the antiquities get back to the proper owners  and that the money is used to just rebuild everything  laura people will have to put in papers with the counsel  marisha i was gonna say /none/ people are gonna have to pull papers  taliesin i think theyre probably not gonna get their money back  but theyre at least gonna get their  laura something  travis should we reward kerr  kerr do you want some of this bling  patrick actually kerr after youre okay and kind of  up and about yourself  probably very casually like kind of wanders around  and like when he gets to the jewelry and the gems  like very matter of factly fills up a sack  marisha very matter of factly  patrick you /none/ know like no like  ooh im ai feel a little awkward about this  just like like this is really not my first rodeo and money  and money money does some  this is more than they can carry  and um i have some uses for this money  matt yeah  laura i did give 20 pounds of gems  when we were down in the city of brass  maybe i can find some more gems  matt okay yeah  taliesin no this is we are taking our tithing  you know taking it /none/ we have work that needs to be done  matt how much are you taking  i mean its your choice really at this point  how much do you want to  and how much can you carry  do you feel comfortable doing  laura we do have a lot of we do have a lot of money right now  taliesin were going to be rebuilding  we need gems and platinum  lets not take anything that isnt gems and platinum  and lets not take a ton of it  travis what about like big /none/ diamonds or rubies  for like important spells and stuff  taliesin a few of those would be good  marisha gems yeahgems for heroes feasts are always good  laura oh yeah smart smart  taliesin we did burn a bunch of them for this  laura smart grog  travis i pass out from the smartness  laughing  matt as grog falls asleep cuddling with the gold coins  like a slow rolling scrooge mcduck  yawn  vex you do findwith eight of your friends too  there are two diamonds roughly worth about 1000 gold /none/ pieces  that you can put off to the side as component  you do find gems but really i mean  how much do you want to take really  this isnt how much did you find  theres enough here to take  pretty much anything you can carry  theres no way you can carry even but a fraction of this  so what do you want to take  sam platinum is worth ten gold  laura yeah so like we have  sam im taking 200 platinum for myself  matt okay  taliesin i /none/ think i would actually honestly say  at least 1000 platinum in general  just for general use for the group  marisha yeah laura yeah  taliesin and then ten of each gem that we can find  laura 1000 platinum for the group then  matt sure laura okay  taliesin that seems reasonable  laura yeah totally  taliesin were also gonna need to put somebody in charge of all this  marisha yes someone trustworthy  patrick snoring  laughing  taliesin oh we know you have things to do  travis the guilt of it /none/  laughing  marisha i see kerr hesitate and i bend down  and i pick up like a handful of gold and say  patrick no its more like its like am i gonna  be in charge of another city  laura no no no not unless you want to be  patrick its uh but no i grab mostly not big gems nothing flashy  but light portable and stuff that  can be converted into cash  like ive got troops who are going to  and a city back home yeah  taliesin and you /none/ did come here so  sam vex there are six there are seven of us  maybe we should take a bit more  marisha im taking a little bit of gold for myself  just cause im low  laura yeah if you guys want to grab stuff yourself  matt kimas abstained by the way  kimas not taking anything  while gilmore is currently filling up a small satchel  hes like well i have to rebuild some way  shoveling in small amounts but you know not too much  laura same  ill takeso hard /dung/  travis im taking 184 gold pieces  matt good job grog  laura nice grog  laughing  taliesin im just gonna put 500 gold pieces  sam dude thats a million dollars  marisha thats what i did with 500  taliesin 500 gold pieces  travis like candy or something  jellybeans in a jar  laura fifty platinum so its lighter  taliesin were going to have to seal this cave for now  sam why the city is secured  taliesin the city is secured the city is about to become a riot  once /none/ they finish getting  everything out of here laura and looters will come down here  and take far more than we did  travis no really  sam wait a second  dont we owe the clasp half of this  laura we owe the clasp half of our loot  sam what does that mean  marisha but thats our loot thats not the citys  laura if we dont take as much then we dont give them as much  sam i dont think they would view it that way  taliesin thats the deal they made /none/  this is not our loot we just looted  laura its not our money its emons  marisha the clasp should be aware of that  sam i think were going to make an enemy  out of them by doing this  taliesin i think were going to keep an enemy out of them  is really more likely  laura how do we even know who we told  it could have been two underlings  nobody would believe what they said anyway  travis sure would be a gesture in the right direction though  marisha /none/ well we can im sure we can still throw them  a little bit of platinum but  i mean percy  sam what like 5000 is that what youre saying  half of half of what we take  how does this work  thats nothing to them  we promised them untold riches  laura we took 1000 platinum for ourselves  if we took another 1000 and gave it to the clasp  thats a lot of money  travis how about we dont give them anything  and we just let them know its clear to /none/ come down here  and deal with it as they will  sam theyll take everything  taliesin i dont know if theyll take everything actually  marisha well percy you once said that every good city  needs a good underbelly  taliesin thats true  marisha i imagine that the underbelly would also  have a vested interest in a having good city  i imagine it works both ways right  taliesin im so proud of you right now  marisha yeah thank you  taliesin oh my god  marisha im learning from you just like /none/ a little  where its appropriate taliesin im so sorry  but im so proud marisha only where its appropriate  travis so what is it we hand deliver it  or we just let them know its clear to come down  sam hand deliver we dont want them coming here at all  travis i agree its more personal  you write the limerick and we give them two platinum  laughing  what was the number you said  laura that two is what i said yes  patrick send them an envelope with half of the /none/ deck in it  gasps  travis it just turns into swords  taliesin how are you the cruelest human ive everoh my  thats amazing  laura i dont know what the deck can do  could it could it cause the entire city to crumble  potentially  ooh  patrick that i do not know  taliesin we can give them the deck  liam vax just woke up  matt hi vax welcome back  travis so what five thousand platinum  sam five thousand platinum  laura why five thowhere are you coming up with /none/ these numbers  marisha you literally said different numbers every time  travis we could give them like three pizza platinum  it doesnt really matter to me  i just want to go  liam hey big man travis yeah  liam thats a nice sword where did you get that  travis i took out a card of this little pouch  and it turned into this thing  liam what are you talking about  travis yeah it was like a little card in like a leather pouch  and then vex took it from me  /none/ cause apparently i make too many weapons  sam if we want them to be our allies  and not hate us and try to kill us  we have to give them a good amount of money  liam what the clasp  sam yes  liam were talking about payment  laura we give them 1000 platinum and say thats half of what we took  liam oh theyre a crime syndicate theyre gonna laugh at that  sam i agree  patrick and they know when someones running a game on them  laura but we didnt /none/ take any more thats our loot  sam thats not how theyre gonna see this  liam thats a letter of the law argument  theyre gonna want to go spirit  marisha we also just saved their city from utter destruction  travis honestly are we gonna stay around  and really regulate what happens here were not right  weve got shit to do  taliesin i would honestly say  and i cannot believe that im agreeing to this  but i think just if we run into them  we let them know that the dragons /town/ dead  and thats where it is  travis im with percy  taliesin theyre not gonna bankrupt the city  its not in their best interests  theyre gonna take a look at it  and theyre gonna get what they can carry  sam so were turning over the city and the citys treasury  to a bunch of thieves  taliesin we turned over the city to a bunch of thieves  theyve basically been running the place  for the past few months  patrick how small town am i  do i know about these /none/ folks  matt youve never dealt with them directly  other than scaring off a couple of younger cutthroats  you caught in like an alleyway here or there  but youre aware of the clasp  the clasp while largely centered in emon  is a syndicate that is across all taldorei  and has some hand in every village no matter how small  patrick right  laura maybe we let them know that its there  but that the guards are coming  they wont have a lot of time  marisha why dont we just hand /none/ this over to someone else  and let them handle it  patrick if you hand it over to someone else  and send them a letter it will take a while to get there  sam the clasp  theyre down the hallway  patrick which one  travis over yonder  sam theyre in the sewers 1000 meters from here  patrick oh  marisha regardless i agree with grog  we have more important things to worry about right now  travis im running for office  sam tshirt regardless i agree with grog  laughing  /none/ marisha things never been said before  patrick is there any of the people collected  the generals or whatever  have you worked with them as well  laura the clasp or the  patrick no the former leaders of this city  any of the people that youve  sam the military we can put them in charge of this  taliesin theres not really any military  sam theres a visiting army  yeah we can put them in charge of it  at least temporarily  they can be trusted  taliesin can they  liam /none/ kima do you feel like keeping an eye  on a small group of soldiers from syngorn  protecting this  a few days  matt i could probably run it id probably have to go  and check in with allie  im sure shed be interested in knowing about this  since shes you know part of the council  laura right we need to tell her  matt we have asumi mean we still have a number  of standing council members  and theres a few we still havent accounted for  liam this is your /none/ home  taliesin that would be better  matt my home is westruun to be honest  but ive kind of taken this as a second home  taliesin far more stories of treasures being looted by foreigners  laura honestly we need to get to whitestone speaking of  travis yeah dont we need to like get a hand  and plant it under a tree or something like that  laura yes  yes  sam forgot about that  taliesin we have a hand  marisha we have a hand  laura we have ashes to bury /none/ in vasselheim  marisha we have a lot to do  laura we have to find out where the fuck raishan is  can we see if maybe she went to whitestone  and the whole citys decimated  marisha i can try and scry with the scrying eye  but thats it  travis how about we go to whitestone and then scry  sam well we wont need to if were there  marisha yeah  laura just find out if its all right  taliesin lets crawl upstairs  lets keep some people on this kima  /none/ and well crawl upstairs  marisha i can try to scry on rai  did i find a little like a scale of hers by the way  matt glancing about uh roll an investigation check  specifically looking for the scale  as opposed to looking for other things about the room  taliesin thats crock thats yeah i know  marisha thats slightly better  uh ten total  matt ten total it takes you about ten minutes  and because the shifting low light in here  the rocky formations of the ground itself  youre having /none/ a hard time finding any scales of raishans  marisha anything blood  matt it takes you about 15 or 20 minutes  before you actually find a small cluster  from one of the wounds left behind by grog  marisha yeah thatll do it yeah  taliesin im gonna grab the bag of colding  and take samples of the dragon eggs that we cracked  the fluid the bodies like ill put the whole thing in there  we need that  patrick they intend  they took the body laura raishan  liam she uh no /none/ no shes been playing us for a long time  we were in a loose agreement with her  to get to today and weve never felt  like shes told us the whole picture  uh we have watched her gas scores of people  in front of us  shes killed many of your friends  shes not good  but no we dont ultimately know what her next move is  marisha i can try to scry on her and maybe get lucky  or i can try and scry on whitestone  the problem is is /none/ shes smart  so even if i try and scry on her  theres a possibility that shell resist it  taliesin shes exhausted still i would assume  marisha she did burn all of her legendary resistance  didnt she matt she did  taliesin and shes probably been running  liam what could it hurt  marisha im gonna try and scry on raishan  matt okay casting the spell  marisha scrying eye  matt scrying eye okay the reason the items dc  not your spell dc  marisha i guess so but i dont know /dung/ if you ever put  the scrying eye dc on here it doesnt have a dc  matt it doesntthen uh then well use your spell dc  thats fine okay so  so as you guys begin situating  kima walks up at the surface  gilmores still kind of rummaging through  and trying to find some interesting things  and theres a few moments when you hear gilmore across from you  like hah hah this is mine  starting to find things left over from his destroyed shop  that have been scavenged by looters  /none/ and brought back to thordak as you know  paying homage to their new ruler  um kima begins to head up  and you can hear now people have begun to gather en masse  into the cloudtop it sounds like other  the rest of your soldiers along with zahra and kashaw  are walking up with her and begin to organize  and find whoevers been fighting through the city  and figuring out how to set up a perimeter to defend the center  which essentially the entire economy of the city  lies underground  /dung/ you begin to pull out the scrying eye  and set up the small space for the ritual  you concentrate on it and kind of thrust your vision  towards the center of the artifact  whats the spell dc  marisha my spell save dc is 20  matt all right  so as you focus you feel your vision kind of lift up  into the dark clouds as the storm is drifting  southsouth east of the city  towards where the wyvern riders have been escaping  into the clouds and the dark the moisture /none/ the rain  you feel the humidity almost oppressive against you  and you feel your essence being tugged  being pulled rapidly in a direction  amidst the cloud you dont know which direction it is  but its pulled you quickly  and suddenly you emerge from the clouds  and youre over ocean  um over ocean you see in the distance  just open waves no signs of land just water  and then a singular island isolated distant  far from everything  your vision suddenly jumps  scats upright to the outside of this /none/ cavern opening  you see skips i meant to say  nothing escapes lauras mind  she is our resident 13yearold  liam it was me that time laura it was actually him  it was him that time matt youre twins thats fine  liam poopy  matt yes  skips ahead to the exterior of some sort of  a mountain based cavern that dips deep into the ground  in the center of this very very thick junglelike terrain  you can see portions of the cavern here  have been ruined and broken down  and /none/ there appears to be some sort of geothermal activity  in the vicinity  your vision skips again and you can see  a deep series of winding caverns  that lead to what looks to be like a stone  a very very old stone laboratory  you see cages  you see wooden furniture  you see what look to be portions of bookshelves  that are toppled over  and out of the blurry peripheral of this one focal point  where the spell has taken you  you can see what looks to be just out /dung/ of sight  a large deep red crimson mass that is just resting still  you also see what appear to be to your other peripheral  two ovoidlike red shapes that are kind of resting in the edge  and there at one of the bookshelves  you see a woman with long dark green hair  um wounded and bleeding  currently pulling books out of the shelf and opening them  and looking through and slamming it closed and throwing it down  and pulling another book and going through  ♪  the vision recedes and /none/ your eyes blink and come back to you  and youre back in the cavern of the lair  marisha shes not in whitestone  sam she was looking for the third book of the trilogy  of patrick rothfuss  laughing  it couldnt be found anywhere  why cant i find this fucking book  laughing  matt and with that well take our break  cheering  thats your break well  laughing  alright well be back here in a few minutes  take a restroom break and a snack break  well see you guys /none/ here shortly  stay tuned  laughing  ♪  ♪  welcome back ladies and gentlemen to critical role  laughing  well done liam well done  indistinct remarks  so welcome back  jumping back into our adventure  laughing  so as the armies begin to filter in  word begins to spread throughout the city that  every fire giant that stood beneath thordak  in the city has been slain  a multitude of the lizardfolk that were under thordak  and the conclaves barrier have also been slain  or have fled the /none/ city  the storm of the ashari has wandered and dissipated  as the immediate threat of the wyvern riding horde  has fled towards the stormcrest mountains to the southeast  and are now out of sight  the armies have converged  and have begun searching for survivors  and putting them under their care  members of the clasp have begun to rise up  and meet with the remaining armies  in discussions of how to bring most of the survivors out  as the clasp has actually been as they discussed before  taking many /town/ of the survivors that arent already bound  to thordak and keeping them underground  and kind of building small underground tent cities  for them to live in while they try and figure out what to do  its very interesting with those of you  whove lived in emon for enough time  to see so many different people  and so many different racial backgrounds  and so many different cultural decrees  all coming to one point and all working together  so quickly and so strongly just for the sake  of recovery for aid /none/ and there is an air of relief  some people are gathering the dead and identifying them  bringing them out into portions of the streets to make sure  that they are properly buried  and the families are given notification  you can see a lot of the fires are being put out  and people are doing the best they can to salvage  as much of the city that still stands  and a lot of the city still stands untouched  id say a good third of it is gonna need  some serious reconstruction /none/ and rebuilding  and being one of the largest if not the largest city  on the continent its gonna take some time  you guys have begun  to speak with the warmaster  as he approaches with his army  and kind of trade stories  on what has transpired on their end and yours  and as this is happening  a familiar face steps into the district  with a small group of cloaked figures  laura oh shit  matt standing before you you see a tall  scaled female dragonborn  tailless armored  /none/ tofor brotorus  looking harried and exhausted  she steps up and you see what looks to be  the cusp of a toothy grin  at the edge of her mouth as she catches your attention  raises one hand  you have no idea how happy i am  to see that you all live  so if im to be told you are the ones  that took down the cinder king  travis yeah taliesin yes  marisha us and with the aid of many others of course  matt then this is indeed the turning /none/ point  do you have access to any of the members of the council  weve been cut off in the lyceum for months  travis aye laura yes  marisha allura is safe is whitestone currently  we can say whitestone now right  taliesin we can say whitestone now yes marisha okay  shes safe in whitestone travis whitestone  sorry are we not saying it marisha whitestone yeah  its kinda nice saying it again  laura emperor uriels wife and children  are in whitestone as well  matt this is good to know i was /none/ worried about them  after the initial attack  okay all right  marisha asum should still be here as well right  taliesin back in whitestone as well marisha also back in whitestone  sam mhm whitestone i thinkwait  raishan was supposed to take asum somewhere  did we ever did that ever happen  travis i thought asum came down to the ziggurat  marisha yeah sam yeah yeah yeah  marisha raishan brought asum back to us  laura yeah that liam sound of confidence  taliesin it was like a month ago matt very well /none/  with warmasters aid and any of you who are able to  well begin to do the best we can  to restructure some semblance  of law and order here within the city  marisha and kimas in there shes kind of guarding  the treasury if you will  sam solo marisha solo by herself  liam we were hoping to peel off some of the troops  maybe some of syngorns troops to help  keep an eye on things in there  matt well master could you make that happen  you see mikael daxio /none/ who is currently  in the midst of giving orders to a few of his soldiers  kind of puts his hand up and walks over  im sorry what  mikael if you would be able  to offer some aid or strength of your troops  to guard what remains  of the citys economy  and mikael nods  should not be a worry  of course ill uh  and he begins to talk with tofor  and they begin to break down and structure  how people are gonna go here and there  so /none/ the longer this progresses the more it gets  into more logistical conversations  what do you guys wanna do  marisha i fill them in on what i saw in scrying  more importantly what this means is that she  is on this plane of existence  i cant scry if shes on another plane so shes here  liam do you know where that island is  ♪  marisha i could attempt to think  really hard about it  i could attempt to think  sam the marisha ray story  liam scrying doesnt give /none/ any direction  matt i mean even the visuals im giving  from a narrative standpoint are like a little more  than the spell should but its for fun  marisha can i do like acan i do a roll to see  matt make an intelligence check marisha oh geez  thanks for your vote of confidence sam  thats not good thats not good  sam for the dice marisha this is your fault  its a five total sam yeah it is  marisha wait wait wait no just a straight intelligence check  matt yup /none/ intelligence modifier marisha yeah its five  matt yeah youveyou for lack of a better term  are the homeschooled one of the bunch  and you only recently left the  well before meeting the rest of these adventurers  you know left zephra to go  and see what the world was about  so unfortunately you dont have as much worldly experience  as other people on your team would  so the visuals you have clear in your mind  you have no personal life experience or any place  that youve seen that you can /none/ connect the dots to  marisha i turned to pike and asked  and tell her of the island  and ask if she has encountered anything  like this in her travels  matt she closes her eyes for a second and kinda winces a little bit  her tongue kinda peaks outside her mouth for a second  uh no  wide ocean you said right  marisha big nothing but ocean except for that one singular island  it looked like there was geothermal activity going on  so it must be near a volcano or something /none/  matt most of my sailing was done in the ozmit sea  marisha nothing like that  matt nothing that ive seen  sorry  marisha its okay pikey  patrick ill throw a hail mary like how wideranging  was i back in the day  when i was doing this for my career  any of this sound familiar to me  matt roll an intelligence check laura come on  mixed remarks  natural 20  patrick eighteen matt eighteen  plus your intelligence modifier  patrick eighteen  no negative modifiers  matt thats good /none/ must be nice  laughing  as keyleth is going over the description again  youre thinking about it and you did a bit of sailing  sailing in the lucidian ocean is difficult  thats why wildmount  take it outside liam laura hes good hes good  marisha dont die liam i pulled the wrong card  from the deck  matt the glass of many drinks  youve done a bit of sailing out of necessity  and the lucidian ocean is known for being the more treacherous  of the large bodies of water which is /none/ why  between wildmount and the other continents  there isnt a whole lot of trade or the trade  thats out there is generally considered very expensive  and for rarer items and resources  what catches your mind is the idea  of geothermal activity  and while you havent  specifically been to a place like that  the islands you know that usually contain  that type of subvolcanic activity  to expel that type of you know  region based terrain  those usually are in the southern region  south of taldorei  ♪ /none/  more like southern southern ozmit sea  close but not specifically to the hespit archipelago  but somewhere in that similar type region  ♪  sam hespit archipelago  travis i believe its archipelajo  matt im gonna throw every dice at you travis  laughing  marisha southern southern ozmit sea  patrick this lair did not seem to be the bookish sort of lair  like the sort of dragon who collects a lot of lore  and would have like stuff like that no  matt no not this one thisthe  thordak in particular /none/ has been interesting too  and as people have been discussing it here  once a very intelligent  and cunning red dragon  you dont know the full details of it  but there was something about his return  to this realm after being sealed on the fire elemental plane  his return involved harboring  an enchanted gem within his chest that kind of held  and carried the essence of the fire plane with him  and the longer it resided within thordak  it caused him to mutate and swell into this like  primordial /none/ beast dragon but it also drove him insane  and so everything youve seen in the lair  it seems to be a natural chaotic formation  of a more feral type dragon mentality  than what youve heard about in your travels  patrick right um the only other thing  i can think of from what youve described  is if she was there and she  and this place was obviously in ruin and abandoned  and she was tossing at looking for information  it wasnt hers but its abandoned  the only thing i can /none/ think of that she would want  would be some sort of lore or magic  which means this is the lab  of someone powerful  which means those people  show up in stories  and so that might be  a way to find out where this is  in this area if you find out  who was doing terrible things  cause you said cages right  marisha yes patrick nothing good comes from cages  so whoever was doing terrible things in that area  laura maybe a necromancer of some sort  patrick /none/ well if she stole a dead dragon  laura hm all right  taliesin can i make a lore roll for booky mcbookerson  matt make a history check  taliesin natural twenty  cheering  patrick the look of incredulity on his face  taliesin thats a 29  matt literally was like if hes  he better roll a natural okay  taliesin youre just gonna hand me your notebook and i can just read  matt no travis well done man  marisha holy shit holy shit  taliesin knew there was one in there somewhere  /none/ marisha oh my god you just saved us a trip to the library  matt dont say that yet taliesin i was about to say  no were going to the library  use these places or they disappear  matt you have always had  a mild fascination with the macabre  and since the age of arcanum was also referred  to as the age of wanton necromancy  because at the time there was no law against it  while necromancy exists in modern day taldorei  more so in wildmount but its generally  heavily regulated /none/  there are very few necromancers that werent sanctioned  or part of a government system so that  it could be very closely watched  and any sort of research or development could be made  you know made sure that it didnt turn into  the usual classic you know my powers greater  than everything im gonna go off and do my own thing  the den that shes describing is very much  that type of a necromancer  and there are only a handful  that catch your attention  one uh  is an /none/ entity that youre very familiar with  that is what was once  a great mage necromancer  that began to pursue  ascension to goddom  known as the whispered one  or the very familiar name of vecna  however however  the acknowledgement of vecnas history  was heavily tied into wildmount  and what little bit of research youve done  into the back history of the briarwoods  says that wherever vecnas old  forgotten laboratory was  it most likely existed on the continent of wildmount  the only other individual you can think /none/ of  that is known historically  was an individual known as opash  opash was a sanctioned necromancer  during the age of arcanum  on the continent of marquet  and then after being discovered to be  delving into his own experimentations  largely in the idea of crafting and sculpting flesh  and undead flesh into whatever form it wishes  as well as the prolonging of life to pursue this endeavor  was set to be was set to be executed  through some very very clever conversations  and favors that were owed  /none/ to opash it was agreed instead  to just banish the necromancer out to sea  sam well that could be it too marisha wait what was that last part  that was really important banish the necromancer  out to sea matt banished out to sea  marisha who was banished to sea matt opash  sam so those are two different stories two different  matt those are the only two like famous necromancers that  sam are asea laura youre brilliant  marisha you guysyoure all we have such smart friends  oh my goodness  taliesin /none/ well we need to in theory  find the last resting place of opash  marisha well you know we have  taliesin cant be harder than killing a red dragon  marisha we have a paladin of the raven queen  and from what i remember the raven queen hates necromancers  laura vecna is one of her sworn enemies  marisha maybe she knows maybe you could talk to her  taliesin we can do that back at whitestone  patrick what do i know about the raven queen  laughing  because that ones that ones new /none/ to me  matt so yes it catches your attention  the raven queen the mother of ravens  is um is a fairly prominent member  of the pantheon of exandria the entire world  once immortal ascended to take on  the mantle of death and winter  as her domains of influence  she presides not over the afterlife  but the moment in transition from life to death  she is the keeper of fate  and keeps watch over the destinies of those  who walk the prime and beyond planes  and occasionally takes /none/ interest in those  that tend to bend the threads around them  um you know  resurrection healing magic  things that maintain life naturally  or a natural life per se  are not infractions upon her belief  as destiny is stronger and if an entity is meant to live  to fulfill his destiny  then that is how its meant to be  its the creatures that pervert destiny  creatures that bypassed the natural predestined  and essentially balk what  in her sphere says is supposed to be  your way your path /none/ your timeline  those are her fervent enemies  largely feared because of what she represents  largely misunderstood because of what she represents  generally worship of the raven queen is pretty rare  from the circles youve run into  youve generally walked in a lot of  especially in recent years  more um  for lack of a better term  not urban laura rural  matt rural thank you more rural environments  raven queen worship is acknowledged  but generally theres no temples to her  patrick right okay taliesin i love the notion /none/ of  cornfield raven queen worship  laura so creepy  taliesin ohh im damned for that  laughing  matt oh dont worry youll  get to wildmount eventually  marisha im sure theyre out there taliesin the harvest is good this year  laura you know raishan did say  i mean i know shes prone to lying  but she did say she was from wildmount  thats where she wanted to go back to she said  taliesin we have two very clean paths  laura maybe shes studying necromancy maybe shes been studying vecna  /none/ maybe shes been studying opash  taliesin maybe shes been studying a lot of things but one of them  would probably be how to resurrect a red dragon  marisha and shes also very familiar with im sure  whatever the briarwoods were doing and with whatever  the ziggurat is on the bottom of whitestone  that we still dont know what its technically for  laura she knows what it is marisha i bet she does  laura she knows what the orb of death is  marisha is gilmore still around matt gilmore is  gilmores /none/ kind of listening to the conversation  while finishing closing off the satchels that hes filled  with coin and is currently kind of thinking to himself  with his you know fingers crossed his chin  kind of perched upon his hands and himself trying to see  if theres anything he knows out of the conversation  you do notice that also at this point theres a very faint  glowing glyph on his forehead  marisha yeah sam what is that thing  matt do you say that laura yeah  whats going on there taliesin whats /none/ on your face  marisha youve got a little youve got a little something  sam you always look dashing but you have a new added  dashing feature to your forehead right now  laura gold right up matt oh and he kinda waves a hand  briefly and it kind of fades back into his skin  and its like theres no glow there  ha its a its a  just a thing  sam oh that seems fine okay  laughing  laura no seriously marisha hopefully a good thing  matt everyone has their magical /none/ specialties  i um i carry  i carry power in my bloodline  sam what power  matt he looks back cause theres people  kind of in the vicinity and he  laura just mouth it i can read lips  matt he kinda goes  im what they refer to as a runechild  laura what does that what does that mean

little strange for you at first  yousuch jovial atmosphere  in the face of such  you know recent tragedy and trauma  reminds you of back when you used to do this  and its weirdly welcome  you know its very humanizing  and theres a brotherhood that comes after battle  that you can only describe if youve been there  and its been /none/ a while since youve had  this type of brotherhood  and even though youre quiet amongst their chatter  and they are a family that youre outside of  you cant fight the smile  patrick oh no itsthis is  and actually its you know  its very nice to watch like you know  it did not stay like this for me  and its obviously staying like this for them  and so yeah im very happy  and honestly if there is liquor here  i probably do not stay very quiet for long  /none/ laughing  laura so much liquor  matt breakfast wine  taliesin one of my brit friends  actually were you at that breakfast at comic con  where we went to the pub  and he said do you have any breakfast beer  what do you have on the breakfast beer menu  travis yeah if ker is with the liquor  and not being quiet  im probably with him matt all right well  you watch as ker comes back with two bottles  after being given directions as to where the  bottle pops  /none/ just like that  laughing  a bottle in each hand and each of you grab a bottle  and kinda toast the bottle itself  youre gonna drink  is there anything you guys wanna discuss  while youre having breakfast  travis were not worried about the spinning  dirt button of death right  its fine down there like its  taliesin i think its on the list  but we have a list we can slow down a bit  sam what is our list cause i mean  so heres what i got on my /none/ list  its not very long  bury a hand in vasselheim  laura no bury ashes in vasselheim  sam oh what was the hand  laura the hand was return the hand  sam oh return the hand to marquet  marisha marquet yeah  sam return handmarquet patrick an actual hand  i dont need to know i just wanted to see  if i was doing it right sam bury ashes in vasselheim  find opash go to taliesin island of opash  sam go to wildmount laura both yes  sam is that the same /none/ thing laura no  sam well whatwhich one do we do  laura well vasselheim is  is vasselheim north close to wildmount  taliesinnothing is north matt no opposite side  laura oh well shit matt vasselheims to the northwest  wildmount is the east northeast of taldorei  travis we may find more about opash in wildmount  laura zahras from wildmount  matt uhh  travis is she laura originally i think  matt maybeyoud have to

and hes gonna hate us  sam wait he can come back laura i think so  travis hotis oh yeah sam well we cant do anything  about that  matt make an arcana check sam  sam uh more than 2023 /none/  matt twentythree  umm best that you know  as far as like hierarchies and devils in that plane  a devil as highranking as the one that you guys fought  that got its ass handed to it by a bunch of random people  in the city of brass is considered such a slight  in the eyes of the hierarchy of the nine hells  that devil probably has been punished  stripped of its power  and is not something you probably need to worry about  laura oh shit  cross talk  nice /none/  taliesin he does not get to come back next week  sam weve done something on our todo list  taliesin i have a bit of  i have a bit of work to do around the house so to speak  theres a few matters that have to be tended to here  that we should at least get up and started but  marisha i mean i feel like taliesin nothings urgent  marisha i feel like the giant green dragon in the room  is pretty urgent  taliesin its the top of the list but /none/ its not something  thats going to be solved tomorrow  its not something thats necessarily  going to bite us tomorrow  i think its going to bite us honestly  if we left it alone i think we would be  reaping the damage of it in six months  matt preferably no biting at all  as you look you see at the table  her hair kinda pulled up into these small circles  at the bottom of her head you see allura um  with just kinda like a nightrobe on  laura she has /dung/ fun buns  matt she steps in  you see a woman standing with blondish light hair  thats been braided into long braids  and then curled up into  these small little balls underneath  with like a dark blue almost shimmering materials  are her robe  she steps in a sits down across from you guys  at the other end of the table  and begins taking them out  and begins kind of rebraiding them  im very happy to see that youre all safe  from what ive also been told that there /none/ is no need  to maintain the illusory barrier over whitestone  which is of great relief to me  as thats been draining  i have also heard that thordak has fallen  so congratulations are in order  sam we also found you a replacement flying carpet  laughing  if youd like it  laura scanlan youre on my list  sam although we could use it in our battles to come  matt ill tell you what when i have my tower rebuilt  then perhaps well find the right place for it  where it /none/ matches the rest of the furniture  until then hold onto it  sam its really a tacky color though  matt i can change that liam we wont let it come  anywhere near acid at all  matt please i would appreciate that  in fact any of my things that you mayve stolen  or taken over the past few years  keep them away from acid in general thank you  laura really the rug was the only thing  travis i took a couple pictures while i was in that  whistling and laughing  /none/ marisha um  raishan is still at large and we have discovered  that we think she is on the island of opash  taliesin the island that opash was banished to that is  liam dude whats name was opash had an island  laura do you know anything of him  ♪  matt she thinks for a second  taliesin they will probably be in  well check  matt do you remember the name of the island  that apparently thordak was ruling over  when he was thought lost at sea  laura do you /none/ sam notestheres some notes  to go through  marisha when did you tell us that information  matt uh this was information that raishan gave you  laura right  cross talk  200 years ago  taliesin just think if we had some device  that would make it searchable  laura could iwould i remember this  cause this was remembering information  based on a dragon  matt i would say yes for you  laura okay  matt well lawyered  laughing  liam because you are so destressed right now  your mind is /none/ so focused laura its so clear  matt yes there was something  after thordak was long thought dead  thordak seemingly reemerged after spending  a fewas far as you know  years decades  centuries possibly rebuilding his domain  on what was called the island of viscon  marisha of viscon  matt viscon in the south of the lucidian ocean  marisha lucidian ocean  matt and so as you say as it comes to your mind  youre likeyou say viscon  allura goes viscon  now i know this island is it was part /none/ of our research  when thordak first began to attack  and assail the seven regions of taldorei  back when you know me and kima were adventuring  umi dont know much  about this opash figure you speak of  laura did you find a laboratory on the island  an abandoned one  matt we did not go to the actual island  we just had to discover that was the  the historical creep of thordaks domain  laura right  matt it was fiercely guarded and at the time  our focus was more to /none/ banish the creature  as opposed to trying to walk into the center of its home  and none of us would be alive  that would be a place to look  laura thank you  patrick um from the religion angle  do i know anything about opash  like necromancer working against the natural order  matt role a religion check  taliesin its in tolkiens spirit guide  patrick yeah  uhh 17  matt seventeen  i mean youve youve come across  a modicum of necromancy in your years  your younger years at /none/ least  usually low level employed by various tribal sages  and wandering marauding hordes of orcs  or knolls that were you know given positions of power  within their small cultures  because they had begun to harness  some of the powers of life and death  but nothing that really left a lasting impression  there was one tomb that you excavated  that it was beyond the southern lands  of the stormcrest mountains  it was in the reifenmist peninsula  which is the thick jungles that exist  on the southern peninsula of /none/ taldorei  below the countryside  below the actual political structure  its a free land it is beyond the rule  of taldorei or syngorn  and it is where refugees flee from society  its where folks that want to live beyond the law  go and build their own place  but south of that into the jungle  there are many lost and ancient places  that were either forgotten intentionally  or buried through time  as the founding to the age of arcanum  in these eons past and past  there is one /none/ tomb that you went to  that was steeped in heavy necromancy  and even just a short journey in  you lost two friends  watching the life sucked from their corpses  left behind just these dustskinned skeletal memories  and you fledyou and the remaining members  of your team  since then youve been keenly aware  of the awful effects of necromancy  and it honestly scares you  and so the more this discussion continues  the more and more just uneasy you become with the discussion  um as far as the essence /none/ of what opash may have in store  uh youre not particularly sure  but um i mean the domain of necromancy is life and death  um and that central theme  keeps reemerging with thordak with raishan  with whatever this dynamic is  theres something about life and death  that is cyclical in this conversation  that keeps you connected  ♪  patrick was that island that you mentioned volcamic  laura the island of viscon  patrick volcanic  matt you should slow down on the breakfast wine friend  patrick kerrek is pronouncing /none/ very deliberately at this point  laughing  matt the island of viscon  it would be in a zone that does see quite a bit  of activity of that kind  there are a number of places in the ocean that are known  to just perpetually spire forth  sulfur and other terrible fumes  taliesin i wonder if a red dragon had been living there  matt long before he came  taliesin he wouldve certainly encouraged it though  matt imi dont doubt that  there is something to be said for that so  /none/ sam more lava

through tomes and books  looking for something  she seemed very frustrated  questionoh go ahead  matt lets just say what happens if she finds  what shes looking for  marisha exactly  patrick oh she brings the dragon back from the dead  taliesin or transfers her consciousness into the dragons body  reanimates an undead red dragon  laura i dont know what necromancy is capable of  taliesin create

gem was shattered  the gem was shattered  matt it was laura yes  matt you destroyed the soul anchor  laura yeah and thordak shrunk  he was huge and then he was like normal after that  matt well thats something at least  travis yeah its something  sam i dont think that shes trying to reanimate thordak  i think shes trying to probe him  /none/ for knowledge of some sort  travis probe taliesin i

you share a vision  a vision of water a vision of endless ocean  a familiar vision of endless ocean  you see small pillars of steam  rising out of the center of this expanse  clusters of them in places  occasionally a few rocks breaking /none/ the surface  and beyond that you see an island  isolated out in the ocean covered with green  you see a large mountain set across one side  as your vision flashes inward to an overhead view  you see a familiar island  sam ♪ and the line where the sea meets the sky ♪  ♪ its blinding ♪♪  laughing  matt the vision fades you both return  the circular glyphs on the table  kind of sparkle out  leaving the smooth surface untouched  both of their eyes clarify  their irises /none/ and pupils returning  and they both take a simultaneous breath  and then release each others hands  marisha holy shit  laura so yeah marisha yeah  we know where she is  gasping  its the island  laura do we know how to get to the island  marisha i can tree stride us there  i saw a treedid i see a tree big enough  matt there were a number of trees laura oh geez  sam palm trees  laura oh my god we need to rest and get there  marisha we /none/ need to rest and get there liam we need to go the fuck to bed  patrick lets go right now  cross talk  that was a joke  laughing  laura shit we need to rest  marisha oh my god yeah  laura and go marisha we need to rest and go  liam we should go right away  what a todo to die today at a minute or two til two  sam trippingly off the tongue  matt you get two options laura okay  matt and i defer to your judgment on this /none/  you rest and prepare  that leaves her to rest and prepare  laura yes matt you dont rest  she doesnt rest  the choice is yours as to which you think  leaves you in the more advantageous position  marisha iii cannot  get us there  laura we need to rest liam can you get us there  matt ive unfortunately already used my spell  to get you to  liam but youre sayi understand what youre saying  shes got nothing matt she stops and goes  ive seen it actually with the /none/ vision  and i did resti doi could  i could get you there  sam to what end  matt the choice is yours sam i have nothing  liam but scanlan pluses and minuses  she has nothing  sam i cant die vax  ive already died once today  i cant do it again  laura we dont have any healing  if anybody dies we cant come back  travis ive got two healing potions  marisha okay all right  humming  is there a way do you know where we can maybe like /none/  restore ourselves faster  laughing  matt i wouldnt recommend that  travis oh  laura oh  matt but nevertheleth  laughing  travis amazing  patrick say irish wrwr  laughing  taliesin hard isnt it  matt she goes back to braiding her hair  laughing  marisha what is the minimum amount of time we could sleep  matt eight hours  grumbling  travis lets do it lets sleep  liam so if we rest she gets her meteors  she gets her everything  laura she gets it all back sam and she /tavern/ could leave  liam shes gonna rest too to get all her shit back  if we go now having had a breather  with this drunk guy  laura no liam im not saying what we do  you can decide what we do because youre the smart one  but im just talking it out  sheit would be a physical fight  with none of her magic  taliesin if we hadif we had a dragon with us id say yes  liam you two brainiacs can make the decision  but shes got no meteors shes /none/ got a lot less  laura look we took on thordak with full health  and we made it out pretty well  marisha i mean once again unless we do this  unless we get to the island  try and scout out find raishan  island that way if she moves  we wont let her leave  what grog what  sam i cant camp on the island i dont have the mansion  marisha we can camp like we did old school style  taliesin she would know that we were there  laura wait a /none/ minute you said you had it left  taliesin and if we go there  laura scanlan you said you still had the spell left  so we could marisha no he used it  to change jarretts mind right  matt well you dont know that  marisha well  laura oh well shit  sam i used it in the battle fuck off  laughing  taliesin ifif we were to go right now  i would almost recommend  that scanlan and keyleth stay behind  because they would be nothing but targets  travis ooh how /none/ does that feel  liam well then we wont do that  taliesin which is why we shouldnt go  because if we go it is the four of us  travis strangely i agree with percy  taliesin and if we wait a day  its sixits at least six seven eight of us  however many was can bring  but every magic user right now is  laura tapped liam allura  matt yes laura except for her  liam i kinda wanted to bring you in the beginning  are you willing to come with us /none/  matt theres no need for me to maintain the illutho  the illusory barrier on the thity  patrick wristwatch  laughing  marisha you did it  matt thats rather imprethive  marisha okay well look if we wanted to go now  i still have my beast shaping back  taliesin thats a bit  marisha i have one firstlevel spell two thirdlevel spells  and one fourthlevel spell  laura oh my god sam thats enough to kill a dragon  liam do we haveheres a question  do we have some healing potions banked  /none/ at whitestone right now travis no  laura we took them all matt to be perfectly honetht  weve given you everything we have  laughing  laura are there any matt dont laugh at me vexthahlia  laura im not darling im not  marisha i havent used any of my health  laura are there any steal healstammering  laura are there any healers within the castle  patrick i am relatively fresh in terms of healing  i could heal some  laura would you wanna go with us liam yes but are you  in burbank /dung/ next week though  laughing  sam pike is out  laura pike is done  shes got two  firstlevel spells left  thats it  sam i have one fifth and one fourth  no two fourths  laura i think ive got two firstlevels spells left  but thats it taliesin its  travis lets be honest  were not quite at our best  and its one diseased deceiver in a cave  with another dead dragon that might  or might not come back to life and two baby little eggs  we rest and /none/ then we give em hell  patrick the brass dragon i feel made a great point  that if you let someone of that  sam power patrick power choose  the rules of engagement  laura right liam thats a good point  and allura makes a good point  travis plus she doesnt know that we know where she is  she thinks shes got all the time in the world  sam you wanna go now  travis no i wanna wait  taliesin go tomorrow  laura i think we rest and we go tonight  /none/ we sleep eight hours its only in the morning  we go as soon as were rested  liam shes gonna have everything tomorrow  marisha can we like do like six hours  sam she wont be expecting us at all  marisha and chug some coffee  matt nope need a full eight hour rest  sam she wont be expecting us at all  well still have the element of surprise  she wont have a lair to defend  she wont have any other fire giants to protect her  taliesin there might be a lair /none/  travis maybe but we are fucking tits against lairs come on  sam you have a dancing fucking sword  laura thats right  liam percy what do you think  taliesin i think wehonestly i think that we  i think if we go right now we win  and at least one of us dies  and if we go tomorrow were probably going to win  and probably most of us are going to survive  patrick unless she is merely scrounging there  taliesin i think she might be scrounging  but i think if /none/ shes scrounging thats a lot to look through  i think that she thinks shes safe  laura did it look like there was a lot of books there keyleth  matt there were quite a number  probably 100 at the very least  sam we dont even know what she is  didnt you see a woman liam but that was her  marisha thats raishan in her female form  liam so she can look at books so she doesnt fucking mangle them  travis keyleth are you worried if we wait  youre going to lose /none/ the chance to kill raishan  marisha i dont think were gonna lose the chance to kill raishan  its just a matter of whos killing who first  taliesin i say that we take eight hours sleep  and we go there immediately  travis she thinks shes got cover but she doesnt  taliesin it will have only been ten hours at best  by the time we get there  marisha allura since you know of the island  and we know where she is is there any way  where we can keep an eye on /none/ the island  magically from afar  if raishan moves we know  matt i mean i can incrementally scry on an island  and keep an eye on the vicinity  but if i scry directly on raishan  marisha she could sense it taliesin shell sense it  matt well theres a chance  marisha yeah lets not do that  travis dont you wanna be at your best  dont you wanna be some fucking wicked badass from the sky  or do you wanna limp in  laura right travis yeah  laura plus if shes /none/ got 100 books to go through  thats gonna take more than two hours  taliesin she may notits possible she may not even rest  she might just be so angry that shes  laura she might not be fully rested by the time we get there  travis i know it feels like an advantage to press  but we were five down at one point  laura i cant die again  travis you can but its not advisable  taliesin lets not let that happen  marisha she has none of her legendary resistances right now /none/  travis no im not worried about those  taliesin shewe may interrupt her midslumber  marisha how long did it take when um  we injuredwas that vorugal  who retreated and started healing  liam umbrasyl marisha umbrasyl  travis in his lair marisha in his lair  doing nothing but sleeping right  matt well you came upon a number of empty potions  things that were part of umbrasyls hoard  laura so raishan might not have that  taliesin or she might  liam but were gonna get if we wait till tomorrow  taliesin /none/ which if she does have it shes already taken them  liam you all can decide but if we go tomorrow  shes fully stacked shes in her lair  if we go tonightim just  laura i dont wanna fucking go tonight  i dont wanna go tonight  i dont wanna die again taliesin its the morning  we sleep through the day we go tonight  liam well then theres nothing to talk about  taliesin i think thats the way to go travis agreed  laura we sleep we go tonight  taliesin we sleep we /none/ go tonight  she may spend all of today going through those books  and then sleep tonight  travis keyleth we know what were asking of you  were asking you to wait again  chuckling  marisha i  i think in recent events i can wait  sam then at dusk travis we plan  sam yes  mixed remarks  travis its actually dawnsorry  marisha how much do you  how much do you heal up overnight generally  matt at night you get full points  and you get back half of your  /none/ half of your hit dice that were spent  marisha okay  travis make the call keyleth  marisha wed better get sleeping i guess  laura lets go to bed  sam instead of fighting were going to sleep  marisha well what do you want scanlan  taliesin you can go marisha you have been devils advocate  this whole time i dont wanna die again  but she could kill us  what do you want scanlan  sam i dont wanna die  laura then lets sleep taliesin then sleep  marisha i dont wanna die /none/ either  and i dont wanna watch any of you die again  taliesin but if we go right now youre going to die  laura we need your spells to protect us  youre clutch in a fight  and without them youre kind of just a  a dude  taliesin whos very good at becoming a target  sam im so much more than a dude  laughing  taliesin one day you may be a bro  sam someday  matt and on that
