none	  game  laura oh my gosh its so pretty the panels behind us i was just admiring  matt i still havent seen how the layout looks im really excited for it also for the guys who  didnt notice weve updated some of the models and we have colors and a new camera setup  hopefully were going to be testing it out in the weeks to come for camera angles and stuff things  might shift as it happens but the color scheme on each of the characters bases corresponds to their  portrait color so it 
none	 should be easier to distinguish who is who on the battle mat going  forward so hopefully thatll be helpful all right lets get into the thick of it  so last we left off vox machina had finished an extensive dangerous tensionfilled adventure to  the city of whitestone the historical landscape that percival had grown up in to take down the  briarwoods two husbandandwife team who had been responsible for ruling it with an iron fist for  five years doing a series of atrocities and seemingly preparing a ziggurat or an ancient  temple beneath the 
town	 city for some unspoken deity that the party then discovered to be an individual  referred to as vecna they defeated the briarwoods managed to help the rebellion of the  people of whitestone retake their town and helped them set up prepare and have their first  winters crest festival in five years since they were taken by the briarwoods there was much  gameplaying and eating contests and polymorphed bears and very fun adventures and exchange of gifts  and some fun moments and the party as we return now the festival over a few days past begin 
none	  to put their affairs in order to return back to emon in what their next order of business is  so picking up from there its been a few days since the winters crest festival has finished  and most of the decorations as quickly put together as they were given the circumstances  still loosely hang around the city as a reminder of the first real beacon of positivity in this  citys history in a while the towns much more lively as people are less afraid to walk out into  the streets during the day and 
none	 its like watching it really come to life over these past few weeks  travis sams here  matt hes going to go ahead and get a scanlan grog wouldnt be paying attention anyway its  fine  ashley squirrel  taliesin grog voice its true its very true  matt youve sent off word to allura in emon regarding the strange black dot that stands at the  top of the ziggurat and letting her know the circumstance and heard back from her that it  seems that  laughter  taliesin smooth well done  matt and welcome 
town	 back sam riegel  sam where am i  ashley i know its so magical  sam whats going on oh my god ashleys here oh my god youre here okay sorry you were  recapping  matt thats okay so where was i yes okay so with the town being set where it is you sent word  to allura vysoren and shes going to gather a few friends and investigate the ziggurat to see what  the nature of this lingering magic is however there still stands the part of returning to the  council and proving your 
none	 innocence amongst other loose threads you wish to pursue what would you  like to do  marisha well we have all that awesome proof right  laura i think we need to head back to emon  sam do we have proof what do we have  laura we have all of the documents that you took from the briarwoods stuff plus we have  sam physical do we have someone who could back up our testimony  laura the new rulers yeah  sam well theyre not going to come with us are they  laura well weve 
town	 got percival hes kind of in charge  taliesin im kind of a big deal  marisha i feel like theyll see that as a conflict of interest  taliesin thats fair  sam should we bring someone along to corroborate our stories  liam what about i know someone needs to mind the store here in town but cassandra was in their  pockets for a long time and what about father  marisha yennen yevon yennen  taliesin we could have them write a letter and we can seal it and then it would be official  laura 
none	 lets do that  marisha make sure that they notarize it and all that good stuff  taliesin governments function on paperwork people have to take this seriously  laura thats right they cant very well arrest percival when hes royalty now  liam technically royalty before  laura well now hes rich royalty  taliesin we have money now  sam do we how much money do we have  taliesin it depends on what we want  marisha depends on what we want  taliesin we cant bankrupt the treasury or anything but im sure that we can 
town	 dip  laura 50000 gold  taliesin dont put a number on family  laura flying carpet gold  taliesin thats actually a very good question  travis so we go get a letter and we go back to emon and clear our name  sam thats our evidence  laura plus all of the documents that you found  sam all right paper trail  taliesin actually thats a really interesting idea is there anybody in town who could reenchant  our carpet  marisha well he said it would take a year and youd need to have allura 
town	 work on that  taliesin im asking the yellow pages  matt as far as you know from your experience in the town there were two main sources of  individuals that had focused on enchanting items one of which their abode or their shop had been  collapsed and they were no longer seen and the other one had apparently been acquired by the  briarwoods to aid them in the construction of the ziggurat and you met his daughter and he never  turned up  laura okay maybe we can wait until we get back to emon 
none	 and have gilmore do it  taliesin well talk to them and see whats possible  laura oh we cant really ask allura to do it we stole the carpet from her in the first place that  would be a very bad move i think  travis oh we could just say somebody stole it from her we stole it from them we were trying to  return it it fell in acid  laura but then what we wouldnt get it back  travis well she fixes it oh heres a gift for recovering the rug it makes 
none	 perfect sense to me  marisha to be fair she was just using it as a rug  travis right  marisha right  sam yeah that seems like a really expensive rug  laura maybe she was keeping it secret keeping it safe  sam all right forget it lets just go  taliesin im going to craft that thing that ive been wanting to craft so that was that we talked  about  matt okay so over the past few days okay as you guys are all preparing the circumstance over  these next few days youve 
none	 gone into your original workshop which is a little more  ramshackle than the one you have back in emon that was built for you this was just the one that you  had pieced together while you were growing up in whitestone i would like for you to go ahead and  make a tinkering check if you dont mind  laura plus we had them send word to uriel remember we had them send a letter to uriel  explaining all the wonderful things we did yes i talked to him  taliesin shut up  travis how 
none	 did the golden snitch do  liam not well not with that face  taliesin can i use my resolve  matt thats a saving throw unfortunately thats not a skill check  taliesin goddamn it 11  matt 11 this is to craft the  taliesin well im doing the whole kit and caboodle  matt the entire thing  taliesin well if i can break it up into chunks then that will be taking it apart im going to  take it apart im going to put it back together and im going to add the fifth barrel 
none	  matt okay sighs you manage to pull apart over the period of a few days ripleys pistol you  take aspects of whitestone and residuum dust as well as residuum glass and begin to reconstruct  it based on its elements in a much more refined in a much more percivalpracticed method you  attach the fifth barrel the one that you intend to be used to deliver shortrange explosives and  it seems to fit together  taliesin okay  matt its nothing fancy and a little part of you goes like its rattling a little when you 
none	 shake  it in your hand  taliesin can i give it a onceover  matt go ahead and make a perception check no this would be investigation  taliesin i hate you the difference between those rolls are really impressive  matt this is where the intellect plays off guys  taliesin whoa okay im going to point out that i just rolled my die before the game started and  rolled a natural 20 on my first roll five  travis 2016 bitch  matt okay it looks pretty solid you think it would be wise to take 
none	 additional materials with  you as you leave just in case you want to build something else but this seems functional  taliesin ive got all the little bits im going to definitely ive learned my lesson  matt so in theory going forward the gun does function but every misfire number is increased by  two  taliesin so that gives me a three and a  matt a misfire of three on the pistol and what is now a misfire of five with the fifth barrel  taliesin thatll be funny oh i also have to make some 
none	 ammo for it since its individual ammo  so should i just roll for that  matt well for the ammunition it has to be a little more specific well get to that with the  time you have at this point youve just managed to finish that before you guys are ready  to go cool all right so whats the intent guys  laura so were heading back to emon but we did send a letter ahead  matt you sent a letter notifying them of what has happened that whitestone has been freed  laura and remember 
none	 i said make sure to tell them how vox machina saved the day and how wonderful  we are and you said yes you would do that  matt as far as you know thats been sent  liam so all the messages because i sent word out to gilmore as well we havent heard  anything back from anyone though its too soon yeah  matt its been pretty soon that was just a few days ago in whitestone  laura i also think i probably sent a letter to pike to let her know that were safe and 
none	 we  survived everything and that she wouldve been at winters crest  matt it was hard thinking of an address in vasselheim that would reach her but you did your  best to conjecture and you attempted it so well see if it finds its way  ashley maybe it worked  laughter  matt all right so how are you guys getting back to emon  sam on our horses that we own do we own horses  marisha they were eaten by harpies  sam lets go buy some horses  taliesin on the harpies that we 
none	 own  laura theyve got to right they have horses here  matt there are a couple liveries here that do sell aside from keeping the horses of the actual  guard  liam percival you have the run of this place somewhat  taliesin im going to assume that i can use some family connections to finagle a few horses  matt okay id say youre looking at probably about five to six days travel on horseback to get  back to emon  sam is there a faster way  marisha theres no teleportation circles is there  
none	 laura no they dont have one  liam cant you walk us through an oak tree  marisha i can yeah actually  laura yeah walk us through an oak tree  sam all of us  marisha long as we all jump within six seconds  sam what happens if we dont  laura were left behind  matt yeah its not a challenge really its just a very short time period yeah you can do  that if you want to  taliesin we have an instant teleportation as a worstcase scenario  sam and where does it 
none	 take us  marisha home to our keep  sam sounds crazy can we always use this  taliesin well actually in theory beat the letters that we sent thats okay we have proof  marisha but its coming its on the way  sam so wait you can zap us anywhere in the world  marisha i have a 6thlevel spell called teleportation via plants where as long as ive  seen the tree before we can walk through the tree  laura and taliesin were getting another letter  laura sealed so it looks like we didnt tamper 
none	 with it  matt easy enough to get it signed by keeper yennen you get it signed by cassandra  liam and everything is good here for when we go percival your sister and everyone keeper  whatshisbutt  taliesin if anything goes wrong well hear about it and we can come back  sam whats going on with the spinning black cube are we okay  laura isnt allura on her way here arent a lot of people on their way here im so confused  marisha thats true wasnt allura on her way  sam what happened in 
none	 2015 the whole way through start from the beginning  liam well first there were dinosaurs  matt yes last you were told allura is coming with a couple of companions to investigate the  ziggurat there was no indication that youre required for that nor could you really aid in that  travis speak for yourself  matt well your vast understanding of arcane elements and the history of magic should come in  handy  laura and drez vina right hes coming too hes had a notice to him  matt drez vina  laura not drez vina 
none	  liam thats in the wayback machine  matt you havent seen drez vina in about a year and a half  marisha the emperor dude  laura no  liam victor the powder guy  travis are you looking for the notes that you dont take  laura i take notes  liam ivan from the other show do you mean ivan from the show before us  laura im going to find his name dont you guys worry then im going to bring it right up  liam shes the brains of the group  travis can we 
none	 go get that other fucking letter please  marisha and taliesin we got it  matt you acquired it it didnt take much time  marisha theoretically they were trying to keep allura from us anyway so its not like she can  help us in emon right so we can go home  taliesin marisha and travis yeah lets go home  laura lets hop in a tree  marisha lets hop in a tree what  liam im just going to say heres what we dont know if we beat the letters home if we try to  
none	 walk up with the letter we should send someone to them with the letter because probably uriel came  to his senses once sylas was hit with some dicks  travis what we cant go find that boy you abused in emon and have him send the letter  liam who  travis that little kid you smacked around who wanted to join  liam hes long gone man i dont know where he is  travis hes probably back drawing pictures of you on the city walls and crying  liam get in line but i dont think we 
none	 want to walk up ourselves just in case we should send  somebody  laura well head home well send our butler  taliesin hes senile and gentle theyll be kind  laura yes theyll be very wonderful to him i cant find it  liam all right well lets jump through  marisha well we technically already have a letter coming and well have a letter in hand  right  liam maybe we need more letters  sam itll be fine  matt you also be reminded you that you have a prisoner in the bottom of greyskull 
none	 keep that was  a survivor of the briarwood  travis if hes still alive  matt yeah you havent checked in  liam we dont know  travis well find out as soon as we get there  taliesin at least hell be going home to a very nice surprise  travis i got one gold piece hes turned to kibble  laura oh no  marisha yeah i hope our keeps still there  sam before we go can i shitscry  marisha to see our keep to make sure its not on fire thats not a bad 
none	 idea lets do it  matt for people tuning in for the first time im going to give you no context  sam im going to concentrate really hard on my bowels see if i can see anything  liam roleplay this sam  sam fiber no movement yet  matt as you concentrate and close your eyes you take a moment to connect with that one moment in  greyskull keep above the kitchen where you had left your last present  sam its a gift to the world really  matt this being relatively early morning on this 
none	 part of the countryside you do look in and you  see that there is part of a breakfast being cooked for whoevers running the guard timeportion that  part of the morning currently nothing else catching your attention  travis breakfast being cooked seriously  marisha you guys want some pancakes and bacon  travis deepfried french toast baby  matt you do see laina in there walk in and start cooking up some stuff and walk back out  sam oh and she doesnt look like shes bleeding from the eyes  matt no she looks to be 
none	 quite healthy and quite jovial whistling a little tune although you  cant hear it so well  laura eskil ryndarien was the one i was thinking of  matt there you go eskil ryndarien thats the one yeah the archmage in westruun  liam those notes are written on her pathfinder sheet tucked in  matt thatll come in real handy all right great  sam how do we do this keyleth and more importantly how do we do it so that the bear  doesnt come with us  marisha the bear will probably be able to come 
town	 with us sorry  liam pick a fat tree  taliesin well we have a really big fat tree right in the town  liam after all that pie trinkets a little wide in the haunches  laura he looks good  marisha he can fit through the sun tree right  matt the sun trees definitely a large enough tree to create the portal you can step through  yeah  marisha lets use the sun tree  matt all right so the rest of you guys gather towards the center of the town square in the  middle 
none	 of whitestone you approach the sun tree and keyleth you step forward  marisha i say hey boo ill see you soon  matt you hear the tree silently fist bump you through its arcane connection  marisha you be good you take care of you man  matt you hear a voice whisper in the back of your mind you too girl  marisha this is the best tree of all time  liam tolkien would be proud matt  matt as you trace your fingers across the surface of the sun tree its large curled boughs now  
none	 starting to sprout remnants of what looks to be fresh leaves where your fingers trace the bark  itself seems to glow with a bright vibrant yellowishorange color as you create a full oval  shape that would fit most of your party suddenly theres a sucking sound and its like the bark is  pulled into a distant doorway and from what you can see its almost like someone carved a tunnel  through the sun tree that traverses for about 30 or so feet  marisha are these cartoon physics  matt essentially  laura yeah we should 
none	 go soon though right  marisha jump  matt all of you guys come walking through it and it is a shortterm tunnel immediately you can  see the other side of it and as you step through you can already feel behind you the entrance  closing as you push through with trinket and grog pulling up the rear you can feel the actual tunnel  closing behind you  all of you come bursting out of the other side of one of the trees that is currently planted inside  the temple to sarenrae within greyskull keep and 
none	 as you all gather yourselves and hear the closing  sound the sucking sound of the doorway closing behind you you glance about and you can see all  the stained glass the rosebushes that are well kept there are a series of small wooden benches  that are placed in a pattern and behind you you see currently wiping down the stone on the front  of the temple is in plain clothes a sleepyeyed currently wokenup pike  laura pike  ashley hi  sam what are you doing here  marisha why are you sleeping outside you 
none	 have a bed upstairs  ashley no i do i couldnt sleep  laura i thought you were in vasselheim  marisha how long have you been here so many questions  matt when you had heard the party was going to whitestone you were already in fear of what may  lie there knowing the history of percys past and hearing bits here and there you came to try and  catch them before they left but by the time you came to emon they had already been gone for quite  some time  laura so youve been 
none	 scrying to us the whole time from here  ashley yes  laura why didnt you say anything  ashley i didnt think to say anything  marisha we literally kicked it for a weekend and went to a festival we couldve come back  ashley i know but work needed to be done  travis so thoughtful pike oh my best friend shes so thoughtful  ashley so you guys made it out  marisha yeah thanks to you excited stammering did you feel our bag of dicks that we did were  you aware of our bag of 
none	 holy light dicks that was an outofcontext thing  ashley i dont know what that is but it sounds pretty fascinating  marisha me and you teamed up and we killed lady briarwood by  ashley oh yes how could i forget  marisha well i didnt know how aware you were because your connection was fuzzy  ashley fully aware of the bag of dicks  marisha that was awesome  ashley i totally spaced oh wow  taliesin who taught you the phrase bag of dicks  marisha i read it in a book  laura and ashley 
none	 hi  travis bag of richards  ashley bag of richards  laura have you seen the prisoner here  ashley theres a prisoner here  matt you havent actually in the time youve been here  ashley no i havent ive been cleaning ive had such a need to clean  travis we actually need him for something you want to come see him yeah were protecting him  lets go we run down  matt as you guys head out of the temple it leads you into the main foyer area stepping out into  the foyer you 
none	 immediately hear a loud metal clang in the hallway around to your right  ashley is it my armor just falling over  laughter  matt and you all immediately stop for a moment  laura hello what was that  matt you hear some other rustling down at the edge of the hallway  sam are we on the top floor or down where the  matt you guys are in the foyer of the main temples base floor  sam okay pike stay here ill take care of this  ashley are you sure  sam i was 
none	 born sure  ashley okay  sam i go forth to investigate  matt okay make a stealth check  liam as he walks down the stairs i call out dont get caught shithead  sam stealth  matt yes  sam 18  matt okay as you come around the corner into the main central hallway of the foyer you can see  there is to the right is the dining room area and thats closed and you can smell the breakfast  being cooked in the kitchen thats far down to the right of the hallway to the 
none	 left is the arcane  laboratory the door is currently ajar and you hear the rustling from the inside  marisha aw someones going through our shit  sam im going in there to investigate you know what ill go invisible first and then ill creep in  matt okay all right so your image dissipates and vanishes as you tiptoe up and peek around the  corner of the doorway you can see now theres a few small metallic instruments that have fallen to  the ground and you see a familiar humanoid red dragonscaled individual who is currently 
none	 picking  up grumbling confounded thing and puts it into a bag and starts tying it up and is currently  packing up the laboratory  sam i drop my invisibility and go over and give tibsy a big hug  matt out of nowhere you startled grumbling and pushes you away and grabs the staff and spins around  sam its me its me little yellow different me  matt you mustnt sneak up on a stormwind like that  sam im sorry i just its been so long and weve been through so much without you i was 
none	  overcome im sorry friends its all right pike i cleared the danger  ashley i go in hi tibs  matt as you guys walk in you see tiberius seems both surprised and keeping a composure  element to him his chin high greetings and salutations friends id hoped id see you before  heading out  laura heading out  taliesin heading what  matt well ive spent a few weeks in draconia trying to secure aid for us in whitestone  sam are you from draconia  matt indeed i am but over these past few weeks 
none	 ive been continuously balked by my father by the  time i had given up and came to join you word found me of your victory thus i instead remained  here in emon ive had some time to think being here on my own for the better part of a week now  i consider you all friends and fine warriors mostly ive enjoyed our travels together ive  learned much and for that i thank you sincerely however my diplomatic mission has fallen to the  wayside in these recent months and while my personal mission to recover 
none	 these artifacts has  grown stagnant as proven by my time in draconia i have still yet to gain the respect of my family  i feel that the path of vox machina and the path of tiberius stormwind havent been aligned for  some time in hearing about your victory with the stormwinds oh thats me your victory with the  briarwoods made me think that while i was sure that you all needed me to protect you i may have  underestimated you all perhaps you are quite capable without a stormwind and perhaps i am more  
none	 capable on my own pursuits with no distractions i respect you all very deeply and hope to  continue to hear of your exploits across taldorei but i think it is time and he takes  his staff and smacks it on the ground and picks up his bag of things i think it is time this  dragonborn carved his own path  liam you must leave immediately  matt ive been packing for a few days as you know  laura i go up and hug him and say what would you like us to tell uriel i 
none	 know they are wanting  you in court  matt the politics of these strange human kingdoms dont really affect me at least i figure  youve got this taken care of and youll speak in my name of course right right  laura of course  matt of course so dont mess that up  laura of course not darling  matt at the time theyd even come to find me im sure the name would be cleared  liam i come out behind my sister and i take him by the hand and i say tiberius your friendship 
none	  was always valued here i dont think wed be standing here without you  matt thats true  liam i will never forget you  matt as i shall never forget all of you and you can see for a second theres a little tear  cresting in his nose and he like dust you know that of course he looks around takes a  moment  sam speaking as a man who has also had a romantic interest in ladies before are there any romantic  messages youd like me to pass on for you to anyone in 
town	 this town or others  matt you no  laughter  matt he turns to keyleth and takes keyleth and goes if you see her tell allura im sorry but  shes always welcome to visit me in draconia  marisha i will bye tibsy i give him a hug  matt he pats you on the shoulder im very terrible at goodbyes so he steps back  goodbye flicks his wrist and you can see an already prepared teleportation circle in the room  flash with blue runes as his image waving towards you scatters into nothing  sam 
none	 shit  matt the runes die down to a cold magicless circle  liam safe travels stormwind  sam well shit  liam said the shits  laughter  travis did he leave us anything  sam grog  travis what  sam come on maybe we should check his room just in case  travis thats what im saying oh we have a prisoner downstairs though  taliesin oh god thats right  ashley yes yes yes  travis we run down to the prison cell  laura i stay and walk around his room a little bit  
none	 matt okay as the rest of you head down you find your way to the basement where your workshop is  and there sitting in a chair currently eating a small steel platter of breakfast is jarett who  looks up immediately as you walk in and says laughs good morning to all of you it has been  quite some time since weve spoken i am glad to see that youre well and in one piece everything  here has been fine and he points back to you can see on the bed that was dragged down into the 
none	  prison cell oh no i think it was actually dragged away  travis dragged back out  matt dragged back out see within the cell is the small boy from whitestone whos also now eating  off his own small platter as well and his eyes light up mouth full of eggs muffled talking  he seems to be fine and in good health  travis any other attacks on the castle while we were gone  liam yes how did you fare  matt there were no other attacks as far as i know we kept a very 
none	 very close eye and for a  while we had a fine elemental protector from with help here from lady keyleth  marisha yes how did that work just curious because he was kind of a test run  matt yeah very unsettling to be perfectly honest   marisha oh good good thats what i was going for  matt yeah i dont feel comfortable with haphazardly tethered creatures from other realms  it historically has gone very poorly so it was good to know that nothing bad terribly happens  marisha sure awesome  taliesin well the good 
none	 news is we can let you go youre free and clear the briarwoods will not  be a problem anymore and whitestone is rather pleasant at the moment  travis hes not free and clear  sam hes got to come with us to testify  taliesin oh thats right i suppose there is the matter of testimony  laura i come down the stairs at this point  taliesin but we can open the cell at the very least  laura yeah why is he still in that cell  taliesin for his own protection but thats hardly a 
none	 matter anymore  marisha right remember we were going to let him stay him the guest room but he was like im  going to stay  matt jarrett steps aside and starts opening the cell as the boy finishes swallowing his eggs and  sits up  liam boy what was your name again  matt waiting to see if she has it in her notes  marisha well i mean ill find it  sam ive got it ive got it somewhere  marisha its in my old notebook  matt always fun to test these things

none	 briarwoods are no more  taliesin yes all taken care of  matt and you visually see a weight off his shoulders he seems to shrink almost three inches  from just the full exhale of his body and a little bit of tears well up in his eyes and he  says whitestone does it still stand  laura its beautiful and growing  matt i cant wait to get back  laura desmond dear  matt yes  laura before you do could we ask a small favor of you  matt of course you kept me safe

none	 you dined on some really really fine whitestone food while you were enjoying the fruits  of the winters crest festival it is nice to have a homecooked meal for a while  liam traditional emon breakfast  laura eggs baked beans  liam yeah fried tomato yeah blood sausage  sam huevos rancheros  laughter  liam you dick  matt all right so you finished your meal what is your next order of business  marisha whats today what day is it  laura are there days of the week what is a weekend  marisha yeah theres 
none	 days of the week  sam what is this world how does time work here  matt there are days of the week im not gonna go into the specifics of it because im working on  it this question hasnt really arisen before and i probably should figure that out its the  equivalent of a thursday  sam its always thursday  taliesin so its not hump day but were not quite waiting for the weekend yet  travis hump day  taliesin oh grog by the way  travis yeah shit  taliesin did you think id

none	 large part of the upper part of the hand is missing  yeah its bandaged over and hes still able to kind of use part of the thumb  taliesin i had a really bad day i had a really bad day  ashley can i try doing a little healing  taliesin i was possessed by an evil smoke demon  ashley might as well get the dice rolling  sam oh pike everyone stand back my ladys going to do something  taliesin shes going to try and undo some of my poor decisionmaking  laura can you 
none	 grow back his digits  travis no i dont think so  ashley what happened  travis tell the truth  taliesin thats a good question  liam i think whitestone owes this boy a little coin  taliesin i would agree perhaps send him i will send him  sam well after his testimony should it prove to be valuable  marisha how much coin did we pull out of the treasury of whitestone  laura how about we dont talk about this in front of other people  travis i could give him one of the expensive bottles 
none	 of wine  taliesin how about i send him with a letter making sure that he is wellemployed  laura i think that is a beautiful beautiful gesture  sam we should solve all of our problems with letters from now on  taliesin if people would just learn oh never mind  liam percival coin  laura no  liam yes  sam how about after the testimony he hasnt fulfilled his duty  liam fine fine  taliesin im not sure what the price tag on a  ashley can i try lesser restoration  liam somewhat higher 
none	 than zero  taliesin yes  matt restoration is more of a restoration is more of a removal of impairments to on like the  whole like curses charms things that affect their body and mind wholly current you know  like that what youre looking for is more of a very minor regeneration which i would allow to a  very small extent with a highpowered heal  liam you just blow in his thumb and all the fingers go  laura i mean you grew one of liams vaxs toes back  liam that took a long time 
none	 though  travis but we really care about vax and this guy can look down at his hand and remember the time  that he worked for some shitty vampires we leave it be  matt what do you wanna do pike  sam has he stabilized is he stable  ashley i want to try healing him a little bit  matt okay so what level cure wounds you want to do  ashley lets do two  matt all right go ahead for a level two cure wounds  sam can i inspire her healing  matt you 
none	 can actually cause im gonna have a wisdom check from her in a moment as part of  that  sam all right im going to inspire her with a limerick  all ooh  matt 2d8 plus five  liam obrien approves  sam there once was a gnome from emon who sang a scandalous song the ladies would swoon at his  rather large tune and say my its impossibly long  laughter  laura thats beautiful  ashley wow that was so inspiring 15  matt okay so you heal 15 points thats good go ahead and 
none	 roll a d20 add your wisdom modifier  which i think is plus five and then add another d10 to that because of his inspiration  travis natural  laura  20  matt roll a d10 just to add on to it see how  marisha you got a 20  sam this guys gonna get a brandnew hand  ashley three hands four  matt okay so as part of the healing as you take his hand you pull the bandages off and you can  still see the wounds are scabbed over and its healing but its 
none	 healing over as you concentrate  for a moment close your eyes you can see the symbol of sarenrae and that glows for a moment  and that healing energy transfers down your arms to your forearms to your fingertips and into the  wound and his hand begins to give off its own radiant energy he freaks out and backs up for a  second but you  ashley its okay  matt  keep his hand there calm him down as the light fades you can see the wound itself is now  closed over entirely and the 
none	 part where he can only partially use his thumb and his finger that  section has completely healed over and both his thumb and his pinky finger are complete now and  can be used to grab  ashley like a claw like a crab  matt but its functional there you go  ashley hang loose buddy  sam hes got shaka hand  laura thats awesome  matt much more useful  laura and it doesnt hurt anymore  matt nope no longer needs any dressing whatsoever  sam nicely done pike wow  liam coin percival coin 
town	  laura stop telling him what to give him  liam you shut up  taliesin im going to make my sister pay  laura yes see and that way dear brother he wont be on the road with lots of gold in his  pocket to get stolen  sam oh yes were looking out for his better interests  liam you are so caring  taliesin and i should also mention i dont have any money at the moment so this is also  laura thats why we have that fabulous crystal  taliesin i gave your sister 
none	 all my money i did  laura long time ago  taliesin well it was a long time ago but it was all my money  travis about what time is it  liam this conversation is now making me uncomfortable  matt 1000 or 1100 in the morning  sam should we go in to meet our jury  laura oh god wait can i just ask because we had three days and i didnt check on it i had  that jewelry box that we stole from the tylieri house  matt yes  laura i didnt ever 
none	 look in it because we just took it and set it aside and i have this whole  thing of jewelry and i also have a bloody bag of gold and a bag of gems that i never checked in  on  marisha maybe we can just hand over the bloody bag of gold to desmond  sam well lets look at it first  matt the bloody bag of gold sifting through it it contains the equivalent of 230 gold pieces  laura all right  matt the bag of gems its a few semiprecious stones but then 
none	 there are a couple of wellcarved  sapphires emeralds couple of nice gems the overall worth of that bag probably comes to about  1200 gold  laura awesome and then the jewelry box  matt the jewelry box has largely gold rings a few gold earrings the overall worth  of the jewelry in there from what you can ascertain given the time that you were spending  with it and your experience with having to hock and pawn things that youve acquired over your  travels you could probably sell everything in the jewelry box for about 150 
none	 gold  laura is any of it you know magical  matt no there are no magical implements of it it is purely just a jewelry box for tylieris own  collection  laura im keeping the jewelry box cause i want it  matt okay it is a nice jewelry box  laura and ill add the 150 to our party funds because im generous  liam your greed is endearing  taliesin i think so  laura all right yeah lets go to court  marisha we have our who has our papers  laura scanlan had them 
none	  sam i have some papers  liam yes our diplomat  marisha bust out the mustache  laura oh wait wait did we send anybody ahead with our letters  liam yeah i mean its probably fine but i really dont think we should walk up just in  case  taliesin ill do it  laura yeah hes you know  taliesin its my problem on a certain level  travis ill go with you  sam what do you mean you dont want to walk up to the palace  liam the last time we saw uriel 
town	 he was rather awful to us and i think hes probably fine after  we took out the briarwoods i think but im not a hundred percent sure and i like my head on its  shoulders  marisha you think he would go that far  laura potentially we did leave town  liam i dont know its an unknown quantity  taliesin well i have some heavy lifting on my shoulders ill take a bit of it on now  laura all right well just follow behind him and stay at a distance  travis ill go with 
none	 him  matt so percy and grog will helm the walk and the rest of you will stay back at a distance and keep  a close eye you guys make your way into emon and the first thing you notice is as it was recently  winters crest a lot of the decorations are still up you see streamers and ribbons of white and  blue throughout the city elements of confetti that are still being cleaned up off the streets  it is a busy day being midweek and about noontime so its also nice to be back 
none	 home where  you can hear the classic sound of hoofs clopping on the cobblestone the shouting of different  individuals across the thoroughfare and you make your way towards the center of the cloudtop  district as you guys approach the main gate the guards immediately step in front and as you two  approach halt there have you business here in the cloudtop and he looks over at you and goes  youre vox machina youre not allowed in here and id like to know your business please  taliesin were here to seek an audience and we 
none	 would be more than happy to have an escort this  is an audience that the king is going to wish to take  matt make a persuasion check  liam cmon snitch  taliesin better 21  matt okay looks at the both of you looks past and sees the rest of the group a little ways back  looks at the guard companion at the front of the gate and goes that can be arranged just no  funny business the moment you do this entire districts gonna be down on your head  taliesin we have no 
none	 intention of anything funny  matt good good he puts his thumb up and you hear the chains rattling and the portcullis  begins to lift that leads into the central area of the cloudtop district you guys step back into the  familiar area the streets here much cleaner the cobblestone much fresher this is where the more  upperclass and elite of emon stay live and keep most of their business you make your way through  with the two guards flanking you guys and you can see four more coming down from nearby parts of the  
town	 wall and flank you guys from the back to make sure that youre encased and taken care of as you  walk through the streets what turned out to be an arrival is almost a procession as individuals are  now coming out and seeing this group of you guys walking through the street and peek out some of  the local nobles and such some seem to recognize you and go oh and dart back in there was a  woman you spoke to a couple years ago it was an older spinstertype woman who was planning a  
none	 wedding for her daughter she waves for a second and goes to talk to you guys real fast and then  one of the guards raises a pike towards her and goes mmm  taliesin later later its going to be fine  matt all right hmm she walks back off curious you are led past the citrine garrison  through the central palace up the front steps that lead to the doorway the gates that are  currently opened you are led into the central foyer chamber of the central palace and as you  are brought to that 
none	 point you can immediately see the guards on the inside step forward and have a  whispering conversation with the gentleman  laura i can read lips  matt you can  laura what do they say  taliesin touché  matt the conversation entails vox machina has returned to emon they are requesting an audience  with uriel the other guard says last bit of documentation weve received was they were to be  arrested on sight the first says i know i know but uriel rescinded that recently he said  if they show up to bring them 
none	 in they dont seem to be aggressive at all if theyre now going to  do anything stupid we could just kill them here so they know better than to do anything stupid  the other guard person goes youre right but ive seen what they can do bring out whoever you  have on shift and as they step away this way please and you can see the guard that was with  you splinters off from the rest of the party and as you guys walk down the hallway a few moments  later about 20 guards begin 
none	 to come out from the nearby hallways and follow behind you and it  liam i see a guard i recognize and i go oh i got my snake  matt and he goes oh ha yeah good and another guy pats him on the shoulder and he puts  his spear back in place  travis see everythings fine its a lovely welcoming party  liam im thoroughly impressed  matt the throne doors open entering the skylight the noonday sun now pouring beams of  light into the central chamber you can see stepping towards the central dais 
none	 is uriel  taldorei who has not been there previously and apparently has been recently summoned to the  chamber through your arrival as he steps up and sits in his chair he notices you guys entering  with the guards and nods his head for a moment and looks off to the side and approaching him to  join him on top of the platform is seeker asum who apparently has returned with his shaven  halfling head with his tattoos on the side and arbiter brom the cleric of ioun who oversaw part  of your guys initial 
none	 trial here in the castle chambers  laura ooh yeah yeah he was under their control i think  matt and then after them you see guardian tofor brotorus who is the silverscaled female  dragonborn who is currently the head of the towns guard  marisha tofor what was her last name  matt brotorus  laura man i need to organize my notes better got it all written down somewhere  marisha so this is essentially our jury judge judgment party  matt its most of it from the last time you guys were here yeah as you 
none	 guys are brought forward  the guards stop and let you continue the rest of your pathway forward you step up to the  taliesin i step up  matt okay is percival the only one thats gonna step up  travis i stay with him  laura wait what are you doing  taliesin im stepping up  laura ill step up behind you  liam i pull her a little further along with me and we step up  matt as those of you who wish to then step up to the front of the dais uriel sits 
none	 up and puts his  hand out to tell you to stop where you are  taliesin i genuflect  laura i follow suit  matt he waves his hand its all right dont worry and he puts his hands together like this  and he seems very thoughtful for a moment and the silence that pierces the room leaves this  underlying tension this awkward bit of wondering this build of tension begins to fill the room  before he goes first and foremost i owe each and every one of you the deepest apologies ive  only recently 
none	 cleared my head of a cloud of poor judgment one that apparently wasnt one of my own  making and you can see he looks genuinely distraught theres bags under his eyes a little  bit like he hasnt been sleeping well and you can see one of the servants go shall we bring  salda he says no no its all right when last we spoke we had a trial many things that  were brought to our attention in the time of your absence in hoping that you would find means of  absolving yourselves of these charges 
none	 seeker asum here traveled out about to wildemount to do his  own bit of informatory gathering he returned about a week ago and just as i was attempting to  sort out this haze asum if you would please and he rests his hands for a second and asum  steps forward and puts his hood back and closes his hands before him first of all a gracious  welcome to you vox machina and friends i did my digging in wildemount specifically wynandir and  port damali near the southwest coast of the shearing channel inquiries by myself 
none	 and my  gatherers before me revealed that the briarwoods while once respected in that community had been  accused of necromancy about six years before a practice that had long been outlawed in  wildemount their estate and all lands were to be seized by king dwendal but the briarwoods were  officially killed when their homestead was burned by a mob  sam by what  matt by a mob all official documentation in wildemount on the briarwoods was set in this day  and that we the end of their line however this information was kept from 
none	 ever making its way  across the shore as there isnt a lot of business between wildemount and emon upon doing more  digging in port damali months later it seemed that individuals matching their appearance  appeared briefly within the port where they bought a ship and hired a crew now there was no  political knowledge in wildemount or any approval of a bridge being built either this announcement  from the briarwoods whom had previously been silent came about the time that id sent two of  my gatherers to look around and never returned i theorized 
none	 that this entire presentation to emon  and these political handshakes were a means to avoid suspicion i dont know what to or to what  means but the timing seemed a bit conspicuous to me those were my findings in wildemount and  based on our last discussion it appears that lord briarwood seemed to contain some semblance of  mindaffecting prowess i myself befell to it as did our sovereign here thankfully it came to its  end recently and you can see theres a nod and a deep sigh of guilt that emanates from uriel  anyway 
none	 that is the gist of my findings while you were off in whitestone sovereign and he steps  back and uriel raises his head leaning forward with his elbows on the edge of his knees still  sitting on his throne its also been brought to my attention that the attack within my walls was  indeed instigated by the briarwoods themselves and that sylas is vampiric in nature this is the  influence that clouded me this is twice now that i have found myself in spite of all of my  protections and intents to defend this city 
none	 that i have fallen prey to the wills and whims of some  infernal intent and that is not a way to breed respect or trust in ones leader i have a lot to  think about regardless let it stand that as of this moment vox machina is immediately returned  to their place on the council and all charges against them dropped  travis yeah sorry  matt so weve also received a bit of word that you were successful in returning whitestone to  some semblance of new order please if you would  taliesin if you 
none	 would your majesty yes first of all whitestone is once again ruled by the de  rolo family  matt it is good to know  taliesin and i must also at this point offer our own apologies which are in order while there  was a supernatural flame of distrust in your heart it couldnt have been ignited without the  embers of our own rash judgements and poor choices it is difficult for men of action to  necessarily pay attention to the smaller details of their world and their realities and for this we do  apologize 
none	 i wish i could say it would be the last of it but again it is a difficult world and we  are prone to action and for that you have our apologies i would also offer my lord that  perhaps these infernal powers are attracted by your innate goodness and that would be worth  meditating upon  matt i appreciate your counsel percival sighs well if there is the de rolos still in  rule then are you to return to whitestone  taliesin i am not there is another de rolo the briarwoods were sloppy in 
none	 their extermination of  my line and family cassandra de rolo now rules along with a  sam triumvirate  taliesin triumvirate i suppose  sam council  taliesin council of leaders pushing to build the economy once again in that sense im sure they  would be delighted by the opening of trade and perhaps continuing with the plans for a bridge  worth discussing at the very least with the new rulers of whitestone  matt we will very much endeavor to extend as much aid as we can to the rebuilding of  whitestone as to the 
none	 bridge this may be more of a matter of us working with the powers of  wildemount as we were under the impression that that was being handled by the briarwoods but we  shall pursue this as this would still be a great boon to our countryside well thank you thank  you for coming  sam excuse me sovereign uriel perhaps im speaking out of turn here and i havent consulted  with my fellows here but you did mention that youve been mindcontrolled twice now and as  council members this doesnt sit well and  matt 
none	 i understand  sam well what are we to do the security that you have in place clearly hasnt worked is there  a role that we can serve to ensure that you will be further protected  liam if i may vox machina would not be here today without the aid and advice of lady allura  and i would like to personally testify on her behalf of her ability and her wisdom and her  heart i feel she has a great place in this city and you should put great trust in her  specifically she will 
none	 do much good by you sovereign  laura plus they may be able to enchant your crown so it has some you know special mindcontrol  fighting abilities  sam shes spitballing here it doesnt have to be that  laura just you know throwing out some ideas thats all  travis that could be nice yeah  matt this is being looked into as previously was thought that such an enchantment was already  provided it appears the magic went inert and a reenchantment is being looked into and your  advisement on alluras great deal of respect influence 
none	 has been noted as it has for the  entirety of her length here as part of the council when she returns from whitestone i  intend to see that she is properly rewarded and regarded in this forum  liam my mother would have said she is a good egg  matt that she is that she is  travis should we hand over the rest of our  sam evidence documents for the archives we did collect quite a bit of paperwork and  documentation that would fill in any of the gaps in the history of whitestone 
none	 and  matt he leans forward and puts his hand out please anything  sam of course we gathered this from the palace in whitestone  matt thumbing through the paperwork its not asum he hands it over and asum takes a moment of  quiet to himself to thumb through and hes very carefully inspecting and looking about the edges  laura are you looking for something specific  matt im currently confirming handwriting one that i deal with quite often  laura oh yes actually that is something we discovered on our own  matt my liege these 
none	 papers do appear to be genuine and that does indeed appear to be the  handwriting of riskel daxio  marisha yeah sorry  matt uriel takes the papers back and its not hes been at my side since i was young his  father mikael helms our forces at fort daxio guards find and seize riskel daxio at once the  guards immediately go to action bringing their weapons and scattering outside of the throne room  you can hear the clanging of footsteps heavy footfalls and weapons and shields banging as they  start just scattering about the 
none	 entire palace around you  travis hate to be him right now  sam did you just say that theres a fort somewhere  marisha fort daxio  matt fort daxio its our northern military post its by the cliffkeep mountains lots of  very dangerous things reside up there giant creatures and he holds the border hes the  adopted father of riskel not his actual  sam but any connection to this traitor may it may be dangerous for him to be in command up  there this whole place could be a risk  matt i shall 
none	 look into it they havent spoken in quite a long time and as far as i know there  wasnt a lot of love between the two besides mikael is not at the fort right now mikael is  down in syngorn on a diplomatic military mission  taliesin your majesty i know well the betrayal you feel and i urge caution  matt caution it is  travis dont forget about kibble  laura oh thats right i guess we dont need him to testify  sam well we should bring him out just to just cause otherwise he 
none	 just sat around for  nothing  matt you look behind and desmond is standing behind you all wideeyed and so confused and  overwhelmed by everything thats happening and just eagerly awaiting for you to fill him in  taliesin this young man was an unfortunate victim of my wrath when the briarwoods visited he is a  citizen of whitestone and  matt yes yes i was told of this the carriageman that you had attacked  taliesin i would like to have him be the official letter carrier for any the first set of  correspondence to 
none	 the new rulers of whitecastle so since he  sam stone  taliesin whitestone my god im hungry  liam oh no so if you could send an order of sliders  taliesin about 12  marisha dont forget the mustard  taliesin im coming up with this shit its not easy  travis might need some gut healing after those  taliesin i know constitution roll  fart noise  taliesin would it be reasonable to appoint him as our first correspondence messenger since he must  return home at the very least  matt yes i would still 
none	 wish to send him with a few of our trusted soldiers to keep him safe the  roads are not safe between here and whitestone in general and i mean no offense to you young sir  but you dont look able with a weapon  laura especially not against harpies  taliesin i should also mention that my lineage has now been restored to me and i am now of royal  descent once again and so again with my companions permission and we will discuss this  in the future but i would like to put forward the 
none	 beginnings of the proper paperwork to perhaps have  greyskull keep designated as an embassy with all the privileges and rights that that presumes  ashley what does that mean  matt that could no that will be arranged  taliesin i will confer with my peers  liam youre on whitestone soil  sam before we give desmond his appointment as a royal messenger which i guess he is would the  kingdom he risked much to keep himself alive and possibly to testify on our behalf would the  kingdom be willing to give him a quick little 
none	 reward for his time spent in captivity  matt make a persuasion roll  sam not great 24  matt not great  travis yeah come on  matt he gives a nod and looks to desmond certainly its only fair youve travelled this  far and undergone much personal difficulty in aiding us and relieving this darkness in our  territory and yours as well i would like to grant upon him by my estate as sovereign uriel a  granted gift of 1000 gold pieces to be sent on his way  sam thats more than what we 
none	 wouldve done by far  matt desmonds like ii  sam dont faint  marisha dont spend it all in one place bruh  taliesin desmond the debt that i owe you is larger than coin and is  matt thats a lot of coins huh  taliesin and its ongoing so if you can think of how what sort of trade you would like to spend  your next years of life pursuing whether it be in  laura probably not luteplaying im gonna just throw that out there  travis laughs wow fucking cold  taliesin drums it 
none	 is drums it is  travis holy shit  taliesin you are a terrible person im a terrible person but youre the worst  travis even i am taken aback my jaw is just open like gasps  matt theres an awkward tense pause for a moment as everyone looks over to vex including uriel  seeker asum stifles a chuckle  liam do you know whats amazing sovereign is that vexahlia and percival were just talking  earlier today and they promised each other to match whatever you offered this boy and i am  amazed at their generosity 
none	 and kindness  laura i walk rocks hand him on the back of his arm just like that  matt uriel nods that is generous at which point two  taliesin whatever work you would wish desmond is available to you  matt two guards rush in at this point and whisper something into his ear which vex you  see their lips moving as thats what you can do the verbiage comes across as actually no  sam oh oh oh the first whisper of 2016  taliesin breaking in the new year  marisha watch the flask  
none	 liam im making this up as i go i dont know what im doing  taliesin look surprised  sam im a fraud  taliesin ive got a reddit page open behind my dm screen  matt okay climbing over a camera so uriels eyes go wide for a moment nods all right the  guards rush back off and well if theres anything else i believe this concludes our  business  laura of course  sam is there anything else we need or require  taliesin i think were perfectly wellsuited for now  liam is desmond off 
none	 to whitestone  matt desmond nods i imagine so  liam oh vexahlia youd best give him that 1000 gold now  laura i would right now but i dont have any on me how crazy is that  travis oh that is such a shame i know i almost thought about reminding you to bring your extra  taliesin since i am also goldpoor im writing it into the letter to my sister that we owe money  that they are to employ him in any way he sees fit  matt an individual of the court has just 
none	 come up and handed him a sack of gold coins and he hasnt  even hes not listening to you  laura hide it around put some in your shorts put some in your shoes  travis yeah tuck it down by your nuts eh  matt he puts some down the front of his pants and pulls his little belt tight ii um  travis keeps it safe makes a lady take a double look  taliesin i also made sure in the letter that they know that he is returning to whitestone with this  money so that 
none	 if he somehow if its mismanaged by any of the guards or otherwise that it will be  taken care of  matt he is escorted by two of the guards to his temporary chambers here at the palace  laura uriel well leave you to your business but if you need any help finding anyone were  here for you  matt thinks for a minute i know you just returned youve already done so much but it has  come to my attention that riskel daxio apparently has fled the palace or at least has not been seen 
none	  for a number of days ive set the guards on it and seeker asum you as well see if you can  gather as much information as you can but if you find it within your capabilities to seek any  information regarding his whereabouts and possibly bring him to justice i would be very grateful and  happy to reward for the destruction of this traitor  travis yeah satisfied laugh  laura of course  sam do you have any intelligence that hes still within the city walls or  matt its only been a few days 
none	 so i havent no  sam could be anywhere  matt were trying to find out now you may move swifter than my guard if previous experience has  taught me anything he looks over to some of his guards who are like what  travis ah sir were standing right here  taliesin you guys are doing a great job youre great you look great youre doing great youre  great thank you  liam man we aint found shit  matt at this point guardian tofor reaches over and says my liege if i might also be excused 
none	 to  do my own search i would appreciate that but of course guardian please go on your way and  she scatters off the rest of the council looks about and glances at the rest of you uriel  stands up from his throne very well thank you and youre all dismissed from this council  meeting and he stands up and begins walking off with seeker asum at his side quickly talking up  to him and theyre both having this heated discussion as they leave out to the western side  of the throne room  travis 
none	 are there any other guards in the room as we leave  matt there are four other guards two appointed to the front door and there are two at the sides  of the central throne  travis i look at the guards at the door and i go told ya  matt they both step back for a minute from the booming voice out of nowhere and yeah  laughter  sam all right so were free  taliesin that went well  laura better than i expected to be sure  travis i wasnt worried who are we 
none	 tracking down  laura the dickhead that built our frigging keep  marisha yeah you know im wondering if i was a sneaky bastard  sam youre not dont say that about yourself  marisha thank you so much i sometimes get concerned  taliesin i know where youre going with this you should finish the thought  marisha if i was a sneaky bastard and i wanted to make sure  sam youre not  marisha thank you and if i were to make sure laughs i had an emergency escape route outside  of the city and was 
none	 maybe tasked to build i dont know say our keep within the last year i  feel like we need to start at home here  laura yeah i mean hes built hes built a lot but i assume hes probably built secret entrances  into different places  marisha because our keep is butted up against the border of the city and everywhere else  taliesin do we have the blueprints to greyskull keep  marisha yeah can we get them  travis they wont be on there  taliesin no but being able to study them we might 
none	 find places where  sam youre thinking that hes hiding in our keep somewhere  marisha no i think he escaped through our keep  taliesin or he might have hidden an escape there might be things about our keep we dont  know  liam i mean could i take a week and really size up the entire building  matt which building  liam the keep for little sneaky holes that i didnt know were there  taliesin well get the blueprints just to help  travis did we even ask where we last saw riskel whatever  
none	 laura can i search his room are we allowed to do that i mean he did ask  marisha yeah can we ask for transparency and information exchange or something like that with  these people so that we can come in and out of the cloudtop district are we cool there  matt youre cool now yeah all the charges have been dropped  taliesin were representatives of a foreign government  marisha okay cool so heres my other question the briarwoods wanted something with emon that  had nothing to do with building a bridge right  taliesin 
none	 what did they want  marisha what did they want  matt seeker asum found information that it seems that the whole bridge conversation  marisha was like a ruse  matt it was a ruse that arose well it arose because he began to send agents into whitestone to  find out what was happening and he believes  they discovered that emon was now looking at them  and so they reached out to try and distract or prevent them from going any further so as opposed  to being just quiet and accepting this outside attention they 
none	 cut it off at the head and went  like hey lets talk about how we can work together as a way to try and not keep this weird  constant influx of spies  marisha so the briarwoods coming to emon is assumed to be just a formality thats all they  were here for  travis a distraction  matt to continue to raise belief in that conversation it may not be the case but that  was  marisha but why send why would i go why would you go why not send a representative you know 
none	  what i mean  laura so you can gain better control  travis so you can work your magic  liam validity  laura anyway i want to go check out his room  matt okay riskel was also in charge of security within the palace and part of the notes that you  had received about him talked about discussing back and forth with the briarwoods in preparation  for their arrival to make sure that most of the magical wards and defenses that were usually set up  there were all removed or false  sam wait 
none	 a second so were gonna go check out his room to see if we can find clues but also  who would know is there anyone that we know who would know would gilmore know where this guy has  gone  taliesin you just really want to see gilmore  laura why would gilmore know  sam because he knows everything about everyone  taliesin he just has really nice hair  sam isnt that the same thing  taliesin its different from actually knowing things  liam i honestly think that if asum doesnt know nobody knows asum 
none	 is our source of information  here  marisha well you know what they say when you asum  weak laughter  laura hes just staring at you  matt so as you make your way over to laughs as you make your way over to riskel daxios room  there are two guards out the front you can hear things being rummaged around through inside you  can see a couple guards are picking apart his room and at first glance as you step up they see  you and the guards step aside  laura council members coming 
none	 through  sam take five  matt the guards stop rummaging as you enter you can see cabinets and stuff have been pulled out  bedsheets have been turned over most of the room appears to have been left untouched except for  most of his belongings anything that would have worth is empty most of his drawers are empty you  can see already there is what looks to be a small chest that is open and empty on the ground  liam well im gonna perception check that shit  matt go for it  laura im gonna 
none	 perception check the whole room to see  matt make an investigation check  sam and im going to look for secret compartments in the wall  liam investigation you said  matt for investigating these specific things for this purpose yes  liam all right 20 for me  sam 19 for me  laura 23 for me  matt okay inspecting the room you find the chest that youre looking at currently vax it  has scrapes on the inside that look like it contained a great sum of money that was then  removed and taken as 
none	 if pretty much a large portion of his personal wealth was removed thats  your inspection check  liam okay  matt you looking about the room vex you find that the arrangement of the furniture seems to  have these glyphs that are inscribed on certain pieces of his furniture that are reminiscent of  some of the glyphs that you saw  laura in a teleportation circle  matt no actually on the ziggurat there are symbols that are concurrent with some of the  writings that you saw inscribed up there you cant read it necessarily and 
none	 they dont appear  to be enchanted by any means at least not anymore but there is it appears like there was  something about this room that was purposely arranged for some sort of arcane purpose  liam what are you gasping about you sound perturbed  laura oh the glyphs i saw them at the ziggurat keyleth pike do you know anything about  matt anyone who wants to take a shot at arcane i would recommend those who are proficient because  its pretty deep knowledge  marisha i cant do the arcane thing  sam ill 
none	 do an arcane check  travis yep me as well  sam grog is an expert on all things  liam natural 20 grog  ashley oh natural 20  taliesin i wanna see how this pulls together  travis confused laugh im sorry  matt so as you all sit around and pull forth this chair theres a broken piece of the  laughs of the bed that was found as part of the guards rummaging through the room you also see  that one of the floorboards that is pulled up has this carved on the bottom element 
none	 of it and as  youre looking it over especially specifically scanlan who has seen many things about the world  as a bard and taken in much knowledge  sam im very welltravelled and very old  matt youre trying to find out what the connection to this is youve seen parts of this  arrangement before and while the runes are different there is something about the way  theyre arranged that reminds you of something and grog you immediately remember that the last  time that your party tried to scry into somewhere that didnt want to 
none	 be scryed in and it was  either aggressively ousted or prevented from any sort of intrusion  travis the beholder  matt its the same type of arrangement in here something about this just says this room doesnt  want you to look at it  travis right yeah its funny but like the pictures that were on the big shape right  theres something about it that reminds me with this arrangement of that time that we fought that  shithead beholder yeah like it doesnt really want us to look in it  laura is this like 
none	 an antiscrying glyph set  matt having a look at it now that youve been given the guidance from grog the  allarcaneseeing barbarian  sam his instincts are just right there  travis yeah its just a feral thing you know  matt hes very good at finding the memory but that helps guide you to the knowledge and  understanding and immediately that is it these glyphs were while no longer having power because  an element of them was taken or damaged in the process this room was guarded against scrying  very subtly but essentially preventing 
none	 anyone from peering into riskels private goingson and  anything he was doing within his personal delvings with the briarwoods was all kept from being peered  into  sam do i know what kind of magic or what kind of magic wielder would have been able to protect this  room or design this protection  matt pretty much any caster of a decent mediocre skill for casting can be done and its not a  terribly uncommon enchantment its just expensive  marisha do we have any idea when the letters came in to emon that we were 
none	 successful  matt which ones you sent different ones at different times  marisha either or when did they get them do we know can we find that information  matt the letter that you guys had sent that just absolved you of your stuff that you had sealed  that was sent closer to winters crest and that has not arrived yet the one that you sent to  allura regarding the inspection of the ziggurat  marisha yes that one  matt that arrived about a week and a half ago so that arrived a lot sooner because 
none	 you sent it  a lot sooner and alluras already left and apparently has gone to seek some allies to help  her  marisha and its been about three days since theyve seen riskel  matt about three days yeah  sam and did we find anything else any hidden compartments or anything  matt no hidden compartments throughout the room throughout your search no  marisha can i go outside  matt yeah you step outside of the room  marisha i wanna do a no outside dirt i want dirt under me  matt okay youre gonna 
none	 have to walk out on the actual palace into the courtyard area thats  around the front  sam okay bye keyleth  marisha ill be right back ill be right back im not gonna ill be right back  sam i think she has to drop a d with that expression  marisha i just like the bushes better  travis is there a guard outside of the room  matt yeah there are two guards outside of the room and there are the two guards that have stood  back and let you guys go about your business 
none	  travis should we try and shake one down and ask who was the last person to see him  laura why do we need to shake him down hey  travis because its what i do  laura do you know the last time who the last person was that saw this gentleman  matt as far as we know last he was seen was a few days ago his servant actually whos  currently being interrogated two rooms down will probably have more information  laura what was the servants name  matt this would be hold on 
none	 let me pull this up real fast  laura the guard just keeps notes  matt the guard goes through all of his notes here  liam hes got two pieces of toilet paper with charcoal on it  matt jeffrey  all jeffrey  sam hes being interrogated right now  travis i immediately leave the room  sam yeah yeah lets go do that  taliesin i follow grog  matt all right well get there before you get to your place so as youre heading down through the  palace you guys go to the next room 
dung	 and the doors open and you can see this young man  probably in his early 20s or so halfelf his dark hair is pulled back into a very tight  ponytail go you got it hes sat in a chair currently not tied up or anything but there are  two guards who are currently shouting at him and currently ones like whered he go have you  seen him whered he go and hes im trying to tell you he just he left three days ago he  packed up and he left he walked right out he 
none	 said he and he looks over and sees you at the  doorway whimpers  travis you two leave  matt the two guards immediately step away and leave the room do you enter with him  sam i do  laura good cop bad cop  matt all right so all of you guys follow in after grog  liam grogs the good cop look at his face  travis i take out craven edge and i put it unsheathed next to my foot  matt as it slams into the wood it sinks about an inch as the 
none	 blade just slips into the wooden  floor and you can see you guys as he pulls it out and sets it to his side almost like mist off  of a very hot wet surface you can see shadow just drifting off the blade ever so slightly  travis you know there are those that protect life and they just left now whatever me and my  mates are gonna ask youre going to answer honestly or your life will be forfeit  matt right um i  travis dont talk unless youre asked a question my little mate 
none	 over here will begin  sam jeffrey is it  matt aye  sam jeffrey  matt yeah  sam he doesnt want to use the sword  matt i dont want him to  sam he doesnt like to use the sword its a lot to clean theres brains on it he likes to keep  it nice and tidy in here this isnt even our palace dont make him use the sword  matt oh no i dont want him to  sam just answer the questions its totally fine all right its going to be fine do

none	 as well 16  matt he seems to be bewildered fearful and not holding back any information hes just at a point  where he doesnt seem quite sure what else to say  sam uhoh sorry jeffrey hes not gonna like using that sword but it looks like its coming  matt please dont no no no no no no no no you dont have to  sam the sword is moving a little isnt it  travis spinning it spinning it now on the tip  matt three days he left he said hed be gone for a

tavern	 reflection  matt the diamond nest tavern thats the one the diamond nest tavern he went there i assumed  to do what youngish elven men do when theyre in stuffy work i dont know i dont know i didnt  go inside  taliesin how often did he go into the diamond nest tavern  sam this is our sergeant  matt not often a few times every few months  taliesin did it follow some sort of regular schedule or was it just out of the blue  matt no not that i recall he every six months 
none	 or so uh a few times recently in the  past month but that was that was all  taliesin i feel this has been very helpful  sam yes yes you have been quite helpful give us the name of that girl so we can send our  condolences to her  matt no no no no no please please please dont hes just weeping now openly like  this  travis oh not on the blade not on the blade  matt you hear a voice in your head go no keep the tears coming  travis what

none	 right next to you looking up at you with this  ashley grog  matt  and you pull yourself out for a second and the blade comes back instinctively  travis what it was all part of the show heh it was a show all right jeffrey youve  been very helpful change your britches and dont do bad stuff and i sheath it  matt okay i wont thank you thank you  sam have a good day and remember shop at gilmores glorious goods  laughter  matt okay i will i will  laura trinket goes 
tavern	 up and licks his face  matt yelps  travis we should give him something ah fuck him  matt as you guys all walk out of there you hear in the back of your head grog this long  rumbling deep unhappy sigh  laura we should go check out this tavern then  sam yes we should maybe get a drink there  laura yeah and maybe go to the bathroom there  matt all right so you guys youre heading to the  marisha well im out in the courtyard  matt yes now getting to keyleth 
town	  marisha i want to do a commune with nature spell  matt all right so  all singing the age of aquarius  matt that got weird  taliesin this is what happens when you spend time on your phone  matt all right commune with nature so what are you requesting to know about  marisha is riskel anywhere in town  matt as youre connecting you feel your mind reach out to the earth itself to all the plant  life that exists beneath and through the cracks of the cobblestones the few trees that are peppered 
town	  throughout the city keeping arduous watch over the goingson within the city of emon and a single  thought comes back to you that says yes  sam oh shit i mean im not there  marisha can i take my second question to focus a little harder and figure out where in town he is  laura what a good idea good idea  marisha thanks  matt your vision casts through and brings towards the outskirts of the graveyard district it brings  you to a series of buildings one building in particular but not within beneath 
tavern	 and the  vision fades  laura hes at the tavern right i mean  travis or is he a fucking vampire  laura oh my gosh  marisha vision fades thats all i got  matt yeah hes beneath the tavern that tavern  marisha so i get one more question  matt you do  sam how and when will i die  marisha laughs what is the meaning of life  laura 42  marisha can i see any type of underground secret tunnels or passageways that lead out of the city  what  matt you 
tavern	 have a brief vision there are a number of tunnels that snake underneath the city many of  which are longcollapsed or destroyed you do know there are a handful that spill out towards the  docks deep beneath the city itself  laura smugglers  matt youre hardpressed to find specific locations but one of them does seem to drift near  the location of the tavern you were previously given a vision of  marisha okay cool beans  matt nature fades from your grasp and suddenly your consciousness returns to just your simple  form of keyleth 
tavern	  sam keyleth  marisha ah what  sam keyleth we found a lot of information by scaring an innocent boy we need to go to the  graveyard district for some reason  laura theres a tavern  marisha thats funny i found the same thing but i just meditated for a minute  sam shit  taliesin thats not nearly as much fun  marisha you know im glad we got things that overlapped though thats good i mean it  corroborates exactly cool well i found good news eskil i mean riskel is still in town  
tavern	 laura really are you sure  marisha im pretty sure i got his essence was floating in natures ether and nature told me he  was here  laura where at the tavern  marisha in the graveyard district it seems like hes somewhere i saw that hes somewhere  underground also it looks like there is in fact quite a lot of tunnels and secret passageways that  lead out of the city near there  sam you are amazing amazing  liam pike and i spent a bit of time underground in the graveyard district with the clasp 
tavern	 i dont  know if the thieves guild is connected  matt this tavern the diamond nest tavern was the tavern that contained the secret entrance to the  clasp  laura we busted in there  marisha so we have been i thought it sounded familiar  laura oh shit  marisha wait was this the same tavern is this the one thats got like  taliesin burt reynolds  marisha right is this the one thats also like a whorehouse is that that one  sam arent they all  travis were definitely going  matt no no 
none	 this one does not youve only really been to it at the really wee hours of  the morning when no one was there for the most part so you could sneak in and out you have not  been there during its normal operating business hours  marisha what time is it right now  matt right now after all this conversation id say its pushing one two oclock in the  afternoon  travis yeah lets go plenty of time  laura i think its a perfect time to take a break and then  matt i was 
none	 about to get to that actually  travis somebodys about to bust  laura somebody needs to go to the bathroom  matt gotcha are you guys heading towards the graveyard district  sam were heading  matt all right as you gather up this information head out of the cloudtop district  towards the western side of emon towards the graveyard district we will go ahead and take a  quick break well see you guys back here in a little bit  break  matt welcome back guys weve had a little break here were gonna go ahead 
none	 and hop back into this  chaos so as the party vox machina makes their way through emon the sun itself pushing towards  about 230 three oclock in the afternoon you make your way towards the graveyard district and  there to the familiar laughs  liam wait on the way can i throw something in here halfway there i go argh oh my foot pike  come here and i pull her off to the side well catch up well catch up  laura what whats wrong with your stupid foot  liam i take the insults and 
none	 i wait til they all march on  travis laughing i take the insults  ashley i take the insults and i continue  liam used to it used to it pike i had a front row seat to the briarwoods and that blade that  grog has now that we have never seen before came off of sylas briarwood  ashley i thought something was wrong  liam it makes me nervous i dont know why other than it looks big and fucking scary i thought  about talking to him myself but he will just kick me in 
none	 the goolies so i thought that i would tell  you because i think he would listen to you he certainly would  ashley did you see the stuff coming off the  liam yeah it kind of reminded me of percivals shit which is why im talking to you now  ashley well that makes me stressed  liam but he likes you not so much me  ashley ill talk to him and see maybe if i dont know im gonna check out the sword and see  if maybe  laura whats that sound is somebody popping 
town	 popcorn  marisha yeah i think they are i think theyre eating popcorn i can hear it  travis theres a street vendor on the way to the tavern thats yep  liam anyway thats it  ashley okay thanks for letting me know fist bump  travis belches  matt you hear grog belch in the distance and it echoes through the open walkway of the citys  streets yeah its pretty fantastic you catch up to the party and you guys make your way to the  outside of the diamond nest tavern a familiar tavern to all 
none	 of you as youve been here once or  some of you twice before however during this time the front doors are open in the middle of  the afternoon and you can hear from the inside the laughter bustle and movement of people and  music playing very loudly from the interior it sounds like various instruments crossplaying and  the occasional cheer as glasses and steins clink on the inside  liam im gonna throw up my hood and im gonna pull out my other cloak the red one and im  putting it over pike putting the 
none	 hood over pikes head  laura you have two extra cloaks you gave me one and then you have another one  travis its like dumb and dumber with the gloves  matt which cloak are you giving her then  liam oh the mountebank  matt okay and youre keeping which one  liam the displacer cloak ive been wearing i just dont want you to be seen  ashley am i invisible  matt no laughter  travis just say yes just say yes  sam wheres pike where did pike go  ashley hey nobody can see 
tavern	 me  clanking noises  matt your features are better hidden by this cloak just because its big and not currently  designed for someone of your stature  liam you gotta pull it round your cheeks  marisha i was gonna say what does the clientele of the bar look like  matt well as you guys step inside the clientele here appears to be regular the equivalent of like  a bluecollar work staff like a lot of folks that are you know sleeves rolled up to the elbows  dirt on the face gentlemen who are part 
tavern	 of either construction crews or stone workers  masonry probably work within the actual district in the process of moving plots or building you  know small mausoleums things like that within the actual confines of the district you see  across the way theres a live band playing of which you know theyre no one really of note at  first however scanlan you do recognize two of the individuals on the far side of the bar in the  band there is an individual named kent plucker who is a halfling bard currently on the lute  which 
none	 you had traveled with previously for quite some time along with the other individual you  recognize a rowdylooking but welldressed halforc violinist named named dr dranzel  cheering  matt a halforc black hair slicked back welldressed with a really roughlooking angry  chin aside from the attire and the dress would look the meanest and leaning more towards the orc  side than the human side but very welldressed with a violin over the chin that looks so tiny by  his massive frame but hes playing away and it is glorious  liam have we heard of 
none	 these individuals and these  matt youve heard whispers from scanlan long ago about just his travel but you dont speak  sam my troupe  liam oh i forgot about dran  travis oh we forgot about dre  marisha laughing dr dre  laughter  liam 60 seconds late ladies and gentlemen  sam its my troupe  ashley this is amazing  sam its my troupe  travis wanna go say hi  sam of course i want to go say hi but i dont want to distract us from our mission  laura no no no 
none	 do your shit scanlan well just look around  ashley how about you ask to jump in for a tune  marisha yeah you know we never get to see you play scanlan not to your full capacity  liam i plant my foot firmly into his arse and just shove him towards the two guys  sam i havent seen them for a while i dont know how theyll react to seeing me  matt as youre getting that word out youre shoved forward stumbling almost being tripped by  a few of the patrons but as you stop 
none	 and look up you see before you a young cute gnomish girl with  very short pixiebrown hair currently playing the flute she looks over at you and gives you a winky  grin to the right of her you see a rather rotund human male with a bushy blond beard and raggedy  hair who currently has a series of small percussion drums around him and just hitting  around and to the other side of the small gnome girl you see a halfelven more mature woman in  the later years for a halfelven woman hair tied into 
none	 a very very tight bun and she is in the  process of singing this wondrous tune that matches this improvisational feel of the band currently  kent is not paying attention and is on the far right side but behind them all towering over  just by stature is dr dranzel with his violin and as you stumble forward he looks over and just  gives you a smile and keeps playing  laughter  sam mind if i jump in  matt it would be an honor scanlan shorthalt ladies and gentlemen jump into the fray  sam 
none	 feast your eyes feast your ears on quite a traveling troupe of musicians and one humble  gnome who is so lucky and humbled to join them please keep the tips flowing for us and your  waitresses  matt and with that the current song comes to a close they all lift their instruments expectantly  and look towards you  sam lets play our old standard and a oney and a twoey and a oney and a twoey  matt what instrument do you pull out  liam vuvuzela  sam im gonna pull out the flute the 
none	 flute im gonna play the flute for a while cause i dont  wanna the singer sounds good i dont wanna rain on her parade  matt yeah no worries so you pull out your flute and other gnomish girl with her flute as well  gives you a look and you guys start weaving together this flute duel almost like flight  of the bumblebees but two conflicting sides go ahead and make a perform check if you could  sam ive never done one of these before something tells me it might not go well  travis its 
none	 gonna be great  marisha i go and i get as many ales as i can carry and start handing them to those guys  matt okay no worries  sam 22  matt as you guys begin to build this perpetual symphony of its almost jazz flute almost in  this improvisational feel to it  sam flute noises  matt the drums build you can see dr dranzel is tapping his foot to it and he gets this really  fast fiddle sound out of a classic violin the whole room begins to gather around and cheer  
none	 vex  marisha here have a drink yeah  liam another whisper two whispers  sam jesus  laughter  sam ashley is subtly massaging lauras ass  ashley for inspiration  laura i keep an eye on him and make sure he doesnt any of us  matt okay gotcha all right so as the song builds builds builds people are cheering and  shouting and you bring the drinks over keyleth and you set them down  sam can me and the other flutist end with an impossibly long held note  matt make another perform check  
none	 sam 33  matt and with that you both inhale almost like through eye contact you knew it was coming hold  and hold and you can see her eyes start to get tense and bloodshot her face starts turning beet  red all the rest of the music stops and everyone just gathers around the air leaves the room as  everyone seems to lean in and eventually she gives up and exhales and inhales sharply dizzied  by it but still smiling and you can only imagine the blurred romantic tunnel vision she has in your  direction 
none	 as you carry it for about three seconds more and then end with a trill at the end the  whole room just rouses in cheers and clapping you can now see coppers and silvers and a few gold  are being thrown onto the floor in front of you theres a small bucket at the base of the small  stage platform and dr dranzel then stands up takes his hat off of the ground next to him and  bows as the rest of the group bows before as well you know the drill youve done this for 
none	  quite some time everyone cheers a few more drinks even though you bought rounds for  everyone other people are buying rounds and bringing it up and its been a while since youve  done a performance of this magnitude and it makes you feel good and at that point you feel a hand  clasp your shoulder and dr dranzel leans in its good to see you again shorthalt its been  a while  sam yes it has sir yes it has  matt havent lost your edge  sam im a little rusty but i trust

tavern	 the far corner of the  tavern now where all of you guys can sit around and cluster  sam kaylie that was some fine playing i might have a tip or two about breath control  matt sorry not all of us are quite as old and seasoned as the others  jeering and laughter  sam well ive learned quite a thing or two in my years and it might interest you to take a little  private tutoring session sometime  matt scanlan shorthalt you know ive heard quite a bit about you  sam my legend

town	 that point goes laughs turns around doctor you werent kidding this  ones certainly a card and she gives you a wink and passes a drink your way across the table as  the crowd simmers down people go back about their business and the drinks are brought to the table  and scattered about the rest of you find your seats and sitting around they gather up the coin  that was taken and kent who sits down next to dr dranzel looks over and says ah its been a  while scanlan im glad to see you glad 
none	 you could join us it was like old times it was nice  sam it was nice what have you fellows been doing for these years  matt well we just finished up coming out here and playing for winters crest we made a good  deal of money were on our way out and figured wed finish up a few of these gigs and dr  dranzel kicks in and says emon these days seems to be doing all right paid us well for our  time here and well youve earned a little coin yourself from this and 
none	 he takes a little handful  of coins from the pile they had amassed and chucks it over your way its like 25 gold  sam oh well thank you but i cant possibly accept this  matt fair enough and he scoops it back  laughter  sam you deserve it its your gig you booked it im just playing here for the night  matt ah youre fine  at this point you guys notice a small halfling boy definitely not an adult probably in his late  teens comes up to the edge of the table you 
none	 know big eyes and softer features and hes  dressed a little inconspicuously comes up doctor good performance good performance and  he claps and looks about the rest of the table and doctors like its fine boy  theyre friends at which point the boy nods looks about the rest of you lifts up a small  satchel and unloads it on the table next to dr dranzel and you see spill out a much larger  collection of coppers silver rings bits of jewelry a few loose coin purses and dr dranzel  reaches over and pats him 
none	 on the head good boy samson good boy  laura nice haul samson  matt thanks and he looks about awkwardly and expectantly and  sam still up to the old tricks i see doctor  matt hey when business is good scanlan when business is good and he reaches over and grabs a  small bit of the gold coin and puts it into samsons hands and goes go buy yourself some toys  and pats him on the back and the boy runs off excitedly he quickly looks about and takes a  bunch of the gold and 
none	 scoops it into a small satchel at his side and hands it off to kaylie  kaylie takes it kaylie who at this point has been introduced as the gnomish girl who you saw  her grabbing the table she takes the satchel and whisks her hand for a moment and the satchel just  vanishes in her grasp in a little puff of smoke  sam i like this girl  matt huh so the company youre keeping seems to be formidable  laura we are  matt what can we call you  sam we call ourselves vox 
none	 machina  matt sounds really formal  laura laughs you can call us the shits  matt i like that much better  laughter  thats the scanlan i know shits it is so shits what do you do whats your trade what are  you tugging around with this sorry sap for  sam theyre powerful warriors killers assassins magic wielders not quite as ornery as  a bunch as musicians but still pretty amazing people weve had quite a few adventures the past few  years  laura scanlans a kingslayer  marisha its true  sam he 
none	 might not believe you or really anything about me  liam you doubt the cube  matt there arent a lot of kings in these lands  sam but theres one fewer now  matt laughs all right kingslayer so i take it youre all experienced in a little skullduggery  from time to time yes  travis laughs  taliesin grog it doesnt mean what you think it means  travis oh  matt were thinking of shoving off we recently got a tip if youre interested word came about  about a dickhead with too much change in

none	 him personally people have told me hes a bit of a thorn in the side of  well any lively folk especially those of an artistic persuasion  marisha whats his name  matt dont know the name but i know where he lives weve looked at the place cased it if you  will there could be a few ways in unfortunately weve become a little higher profile during our  stay here than we expected and i dont know if were quite as skilled in the realm of shadowwalking  laura doctor were quite skilled but we have 
none	 a bit of a name for ourselves as well im afraid we  may not be able to help you out  matt right very well  taliesin were quite the opposite of low profile  matt well not to worry figured id pass it your way  sam if we were to pursue it what would your take be  matt well based on a finders fee and based on the relationship weve had all these years our  troupe would be happy to take a 40 cut  sam and this is a vast sum of money we 
none	 might find  matt from what ive heard sizeable enough for me to want to include someone the likes of you  you know i dont like to include outsiders so regularly  sam well im not quite an outsider yes them well we could investigate if you give us an  address or description  matt all right all right  liam i havent been paying close attention but who is this mark  laura he didnt say his name  liam dont know his name hes just a dickhead thats all you know  laura what district does

none	 yeah  marisha really  matt were all rather less fortunate than this dickhead and i dont see why a little off his  table wouldnt even be noticed probably  marisha and where exactly did you find this information on this dickhead  travis i think he said he asked him  marisha you asked him what  travis no no the old man asked him oh i need to redistribute  matt i have my reasons my connections my friends here and ive been told that his estate  has been abandoned for some time actually  sam 
dung	 keyleth this is an old friend of mine who i trust very much he saved me when i was troubled  and taught me much about the ways of performing and charming he has my full trust  marisha well if i know anything about your skills scanlan i think it says a lot about dr  dranzel so  sam ill take that as a compliment  marisha youre welcome forgive me if im  taliesin i think we obviously any friend of scanlan is a friend of ours and i think if dr  dranzel here may i 
none	 call you dr dranzel  matt you may  ashley can i call you dr dra  taliesin that has a really nice ring to it  matt sounds to me unfinished and rather sloppy just doctor is fine  ashley all right sorry  taliesin professor dranzel  matt yes doctor doctor  taliesin dr dranzel and i want to know if youre really a doctor later but i think  perhaps maybe theres a little tidbit of information about this that youre holding back  with because i would understand were new we dont really know each other 
none	 were not really on  that friendship level yet but my point is we could be friends like that we could be im  trying to see if this works  matt make a persuasion check  taliesin you know what im doing im attempting friends  matt oh interesting  taliesin im attempting  matt okay okay good to know this all right then what saving throw does he get for that one  taliesin i get advantage on charisma rolls  matt oh right right okay okay yep go for it  taliesin am i just rolling charisma

none	 finding our ears  taliesin if its the house that i think it is its already been  laura pillaged  taliesin pillaged pillaged is a good word the rumors were not incorrect but  sam what house is this  taliesin do you remember with the agonday with our utlerbay  sam i dont speak latin  laura pretty sure its already been cleaned out  matt thats unfortunate  laura unless youre hearing things we dont know about  matt i know that a few individuals have tried to make their way in came out with hefty sums

none	 in before and they came out with a decent chunk of change given that they could only  be in there for a short time  liam im gonna insight check that is a 19  matt hes hard to read but the best you can tell is hes been pretty clear with you and at this  point as youre looking at him his eyes go  taliesin and this is the point where i buy you a beer and i put the coin down  matt laughs youre a tricky one all right youve got yourself some talented 
none	 compadres  sam well they cant play as well as you but theyre pretty good  matt he takes the coin takes the drink well you know where it is you know what it looks like  if youre interested in finding your way in and come out with anything well be here about  another week  laura all right how long have you been here  matt probably been here about two weeks now two and a half weeks  laura hmm have you noticed im sure youve seen many people come in and out but an older

none	 has changed and she has gotten guarded nope havent seen anyone like  that here sorry no a lot of patrons coming through  laura yeah so many people come in and out it would be so easy to lose sight of somebody like  that who came in i put five gold pieces onto the countertop it sure would be wonderful if you  could remember anything about him being here however  matt she takes her cloth that shes wiping the counter with and wipes over and pushes the gold  coins towards you pulls back and goes 
tavern	 sorry dear i cant help you  liam i walk up by my sister and where the woman just wiped that away i take a piece of chalk out  of my pocket and write thieves cant not the word thieves cant i use the thieves cant on  the bar and say in that language there is a threat here i can help you deal with it and  thats it  matt make a persuasion check  liam persuasion you said 20  matt she looks at it looks at you still holding her cloth wipes it clean

none	 are a series of crates and stuff but in the far back  corner there are two sacks that are labeled rice and grain that are leaned up against  each other so well get to you guys in just a moment who is next up after you guys  sam after they go i call back to the kitchen and i say to choose the first song will be the lovely  gentlemen who have prepared our food for the evening please come out here and choose a song  for us  matt everyone looks over and one

none	 busy kitchen could you sing clouds upon the horizon that was my favorite as a girl  sam ah its a ballad but okay sure  laughter  liam do you have an earring on scanlan i need you to make an ode to the kitchen staff could you  call the kitchen staff out and  sam i did already i did already  laura you called the kitchen staff out  sam yes theyre the ones who are suggesting the song  liam oh really weve just been in in the back in that downstairs room where we

tavern	 with a disadvantage  travis 13  laura 16  matt after the youre really bringing trinket down there with you  laura is that bad what else  sam yelling yes its bad  laughter  matt as you all are waiting you guys start heading around and as youre scooting around the  kitchen staff trinket who is currently out front sees everyone scooting around and  disappearing into the back leaning his head into the tavern goes bear grunt and begins walking  into the tavern other patrons start like startled exclamations then like bear bear  
tavern	 bear and other individuals start standing up and seeing this bear come lumbering through the  tavern towards the kitchen  laura oh shit i hear it i come out of the kitchen very sneakily oh oh my bear ive been  looking everywhere for you trinket  liam story of my life  laura what are you doing in this tavern oh dear we should probably head outside you and me  trinket  liam youve got two minutes  laura fuck i tell him oh oh no thats so sad but i tell him to head back to

none	 the way very  quickly and there is this similar hatch that you guys have come through before its about five by  five foot wide  liam i check for traps check for traps  matt go for it  travis so mayhaps with the bear entering there is enough of a distraction for one suit of armor  to clankily make its way down  sam you would think  matt you guys were caught in the attention with trinket at the same time so you guys were in the  middle of the fray as you were 
none	 walking past as youre bringing trinket out the attention is  pulled away i want you guys to make another stealth check  ashley come on  matt grog you have disadvantage on this one now  ashley fuck ugh same rolls exact same rolls  travis 12  ashley nine  matt you guys walk past as youre stepping into the kitchen you hear the voice of one of the  staff excuse me excuse me you cant be back here this is our kitchen were trying  ashley im gonna throw up im gonna throw up  travis

none	 back and forth with your flutes  just picking off improvising off of the classic laughs make another perform check  sam everybody give it up for zed on drums 24  matt all right kaylie is trying to keep up and you can see her face starting to go red but shes  determined on this and she continues pushing this into an improvisational flurry of notes that  completely walks around your performance previously done and you find yourself having to  take a step back as she begins stepping up onto the table and now even at 
town	 her gnomish height is  looking over the entire crowd as people who were not previously as interested are starting  to turn around and look towards you two play  sam i cant be oneupped i use minor illusion to create sort of a mirror image of myself over  myself also playing the flute  laughter  matt make another performance check with advantage  sam with advantage not as good 22  matt 22 all right  marisha i cant believe the jethro tull song with no flutes was the one you happened to find  sam 
none	 it was a ballad she chose a ballad  liam you have the best of jethro tull over there or what  matt apparently all jethro tull songs dont have any flute in them failure big failure on that part  sam just play the scene from anchorman  matt were going to go back to the  laughter  matt you failed me tull failed me a great moment ruined by your inability to play a flute in  your own album  laughter  taliesin jethro tull would be a great name for a sith  laura and 
none	 ashley it would  liam careful careful im still raw  matt aw anyway as it crescendos and crescendos what did you roll  sam 22  matt 22 you can see now the volume of her flute playing begins to pull back as you begin to  step up onto the same table next to her twice as high now with the illusionary scanlan above you  almost like those awkward middle school superimposed photos of yourself in the upper  corner  sam and lasers in the background  matt yeah as the music swells and the drums 
none	 start picking up you see dranzel has now pulled  up his violin and hes now furiously fiddling along with it the music swells and swells the  guy in the kitchen who is looking for you guys hears this and now turns his head and goes  whats going on and looks back into the room guys make one more stealth check  ashley come on  travis with advantage  matt no  liam were all doing stealth checks  laura no just me  travis what is fucking going on  laura i got 18  travis

tavern	 up and swells at this point make one final performance check  sam 27  matt 27 with this note you bring once again this same duel you guys had when you first entered  the tavern and you and kaylie are facing off looking directly at each other furiously going on  your flutes  sam blowing at each other  matt eyes locked tapping your feet heavily against the actual wood to the table the rhythmic  pounding of your feet and the drums because the entire room now also slamming their tables in with  it as 
none	 the music builds and builds until eventually you both take one deep breath and go for that same  sustained note a second time shes challenging you at the game she lost last time and the two of  you both swell into this cacophonous spray of music that hits this one final note that pierces  through and all the slamming stops and everyone just waits to hear how long it will go it carries  and carries and carries the breath never seems to end roll another performance roll  laura come on scanlan  sam its a 
none	 22 but im going to let her win  matt as you begin to trail off the sound of the note you can  see shes starting to already go a little blue in the face  determined to win this and shes about to falter you could win this if you want to but are you  going to let her  sam with a wink i end my note  matt as the flute leaves your lips and you go into a fake gasp of air she finishes on a high  piercing tune a trill and then 
none	 finishes off carrying the flute away with a smile as your  illusion fades  sam ladies and gentlemen kaylies fine ladies and gentlemen  matt youre good but im better  sam i tip my hat to her and say yes maam it seems that tonight you are all right i kick her  100 gold  travis what  matt you said your purse  sam is she going to inspect it  matt you reach over are you going to start thumbing through your purse and pulling out gold  she goes no your purse you bet 
none	 your purse  sam i mean that was a figure of speech right  laura you totally let her win and youre going to give her all your money  travis he forgot about that part  matt i spit on it she looks over to dranzel dranzel goes i did hear you say a full purse  liam oh i hope theres so much money in that bag  sam a deal is a deal  travis the things you do for women  laura do not give her your money  matt what are you doing scanlan  
tavern	 taliesin if there was a piece of advice that ever lived  sam i untie the purse and i hand it over  laura do you take any of the gold out secretly before you hand it over to her  matt youre not there  taliesin such a life lesson  matt she takes it how much was in there  sam 2600  matt she takes the chain purse and weighs it let it be known throughout this tavern that  scanlan shorthalt is a man of his word  sam thank you my dear  matt she 
none	 takes the chain purse and flicks it away it vanishes in a puff of smoke she goes  thats a lot of coin  sam i get around a lot  matt perhaps well have a drink later and she steps off the table now the rest of you have all  made your way down into the storage chamber  laura oh god  liam anything we encounter is far easier than what just happened  laura do you want to cry because i would want to cry  sam money means nothing to me  ashley should somebody 
none	 pickpocket her  laura fuck yeah man  matt are you going to join them  sam yes of course  matt go ahead and make a stealth check  sam oh wait oh yes i still have to sneak back there dont i i just go invisible  matt all right you step under one of the nearby tables and come out completely invisible you  make your way stepping through the kitchen downstairs and find that you currently right  now vax you are going to unlock the latch you said  liam im sorry i was just 
none	 thinking of wendydoodles art from the comic yeah yeah im  going to check that door for traps is what im going to do  matt all right perception check wait you checked earlier theres no traps theres just a  lock  liam earlier yeah i did get a 25 up top yeah i thought you were giving me another door yeah  25 up top where the fake bags of rice were  matt right but it was still locked you didnt roll to  liam to pick it sure thats no problem it is a 23  
none	 matt 23 its a little tough you just manage to get it up and it comes off and the latch pretty  solid still  liam amateurs  matt okay you open the creaks leads down below and you find yourself looking down into a familiar  stairway that leads into darkness  liam all right i know sometimes i can seem like im an idiot but let me do the talking yeah and  then i start down and lead the way  matt all right so as you push down the stairway were doing marching order here just 
none	 so  we have it so we have currently youre at the front whos behind vax  laura me  matt all right vex youre behind him whos behind vex  taliesin i am  matt all right percy  marisha im up next  matt all right now scanlan pike grog whos up next  ashley oh do we roll  matt no just let me who wants to go after keyleth  sam im probably in the back since i was the last to move  matt okay so scanlan will be in the back and then probably 
none	 grog next to him and pike right  there  taliesin he made a little rainbow  marisha oh it is a rainbow  laura its so pretty  taliesin they cant see it because its off they wont be able to see it  matt theres a reason for that all right so as you step down the wood creaking with every  hereandthere step it stops switches back and then heads down further you can see that this  area of the room is mostly completed in construction but a portion of this has been  rebuilt if 
none	 you recall last time you guys exited part of this exit was destroyed it has been  reconstructed and there at the bottom of the stairway is a thick wooden door wrapped in iron  bars or strips of iron to keep it nice and taut and strong and you can immediately see five locks  down the side of the door  liam everybody hold up for a second could we crowdsurf the bard up to us at the front please  sam oh is that me  liam the bard yes  sam grog toss me forward  
none	 travis not really getting his meaning i grab him by the back of the shirt and i just chuck him  matt being at the bottom of a stairway i want you to make an acrobatics check  sam laughs oh acrobatics 12  matt 12 scanlan boof on the ground right next to you thankfully just missing the bottom stair  which would have hurt even worse in the back but through the slight toss you take six points of  damage the fall a real crick in your back in your back in your shoulder from the impact 
none	 you  get up  sam thanks grog thanks  liam im gonna scoop a hand under his head and give him a slap on both sides  sam huffs what are we looking at  liam listen to me im gonna try to do the talking in here because i know these people a  little but if that fails i need you all right  sam you me yes just do my thing  liam i need you on ice for a little while all right so just stay between me and my sister  sam okay yes 
none	 yes sir  liam five locks  matt five locks yes  liam i want to perception check for traps and for thieves cant and anything else  matt okay  liam thats all right 20  matt okay looking about the locks none of them look to be trapped you do notice that there is a  bit of scratching on the wood next to each lock each one is a different language what languages  do you speak  liam i speak elvish common abyssal  laura you speak the same languages as me  matt its like 
none	 you grew up together  laura oh i also speak undercommon  matt okay looking at it abyssal you do recognize two of them and its the top one and  the bottom one and both of them the equivalent in common would be a phrase like enter or pass  ashley is one of them in underdark  matt no undercommon no  laura what about draconic  matt underdark would be undercommon  taliesin celestial elven  matt nothing in elven  ashley dwarvish  matt there is a dwarvish one  travis oh oh i have a 
none	 belt of dwarvenkind that lets me read dwarvish  matt if you could read  laughter  laura but thats okay pike can read dwarvish  sam it sounds like the abyssal ones are the ones that you have to do  liam theres five of them  sam yeah but those say enter  taliesin we dont know what the other ones say though  matt all right so there is the one in the middle is in dwarven the two of you recognize  it you walk up and say thats dwarven but thats as far as you 
none	 actually understand you know  its dwarven go ahead and make an intelligence check just go for it roll a d20 and add your  modifier  travis for intelligence  matt yeah  travis laughs nine  laura you have a negative two modifier laughs  matt you its dwarvish you know dwarvish  ashley i do  matt okay coming up behind grog and you whisper to him and let him have the moment you recognize  the rune and its the common equivalent of entry enter  liam none of them are in elvish  matt no 
none	 none of them are in elvish  marisha sylvan  matt theres no elvish whatsoever  travis this word in dwarvish means gentry  matt does anyone know goblin  laura dont you know goblin scanlan  sam i fucking hate goblins that doesnt mean i know their language  matt and does anyone know primordial  marisha i do  taliesin you know primordial  matt the fourth one on the bottom you have the top one and the bottom  one which you read the middle one in dwarvish which you guys read the fourth one is a 
none	  primordial phrase that says the equivalent and it is a language of guttural elemental sounds it is  a no a stop a general halt type  sam shit dont do that lock  liam so we that leaves one left and we dont know what says theres no thieves cant on this door  laura so wait the top one is a yes the middle one is a yes the bottom one is a yes  matt the second one down  laura we dont know  matt the second one down you do know thats the one 
none	 that says no  sam the bslot we dont know  liam so all together theres five locks and we know four of them  matt you know four of them yes  ashley is there any way to try to figure out what it says  matt outside of not knowing the language or any magical means that would allow you to  liam i look at the two in abyssal they say entry is that right  matt correct  liam and i already checked for traps and there were no traps just locks  matt no you 
none	 have not checked for traps on this one  liam do i need to check each lock  matt you would  liam fuck  sam why dont you just check the two that are unknown to us that are negative  marisha do you want an enhancement of your abilities  liam yeah  marisha okay you use dexterity right i give him cats grace i cast enhance  ability on him  sam youre making this shit up  marisha kind of yeah  matt all right so keyleth reaches out and you feel your form become even 
none	 more so you have  advantage now on dexterity checks for as long as she remains concentration on the spell  liam so we got abyssal abyssal dwarven in the middle and  matt primordial on the second to last  liam and the primordial says no yeah  matt correct  liam the abyssals say yes and the dwarven said what  laura yes they all say enter entry  liam so i want to try to pick the three that i know two abyssals and the dwarven say entry and i  have advantage on  laura did 
none	 you check for traps  liam i did i checked for traps right  matt youre rolling right now to check for traps  liam im rolling right now to check for traps  matt all right go for it  liam so the top is abyssal here i go  laura natural 20  matt the top one is locked but it is not trapped  sam go for the middle  liam no im gonna unlock that  matt okay go for it with advantage  liam with advantage  laura balls  liam four so thats okay 
none	 this is lockpick right 23  matt 23 not a very complicated lock the top one click comes off without a problem  perfectly silently you just pull the latch back creaks  liam all right im gonna go down to the bottom to the abyssal at the bottom checking for traps  laura natural 20  matt you dont have advantage on checking for traps  liam oh i thought you said i did  matt no for making the checks you do this is for dexterity checking for traps is a perception  roll  liam perceptions 20 
none	  matt okay bottom one not trapped  liam all right dwarven in the middle checking for traps  matt go for it  liam 20  matt that one is also not trapped  liam all right thats three the fourth one was primordial  laura yes and dont  liam 20  matt that one is trapped  liam and the primordial said no  marisha yeah in their language its pronounced huhgluf  liam but what does it mean weve got three traps  sam what the fuck is wrong with you the ones that say no 
none	 are trapped how is this hard to  understand  liam that is 26 the last one  matt the second one the one that  liam that we dont know what it is  matt youve seen scribbles like this before it appears to be some sort of goblinoid language but  none of you actually understand what it says does appear to be trapped  liam does appear to be trapped  laura how about you dont unlock those ones  travis no no dont tell him  liam im not alone and this affects you asshole  
dung	 ashley unlock the ones that are not trapped  marisha you already popped the top lock and nothing happened right  liam so theres two that are trapped im going to attempt to disarm the two that are trapped  travis yeah do that  sam what are you doing  liam this affects you you dark swordwielding dick  travis no im serious you had a good thought  sam why would you do that do the ones that arent trapped first  liam everybody wait wait wait wait everybody please walk up the stairs ten feet please  
none	 ashley no  liam yeah walk up the stairs ten feet  laura im walking away  liam youre all gonna see it  sam what are you doing  liam im gonna try to open the door you little asshole but i dont want you to get burned while  i get burned  sam i wont be burned because youre not gonna mess with the traps just do the ones that arent  trapped  travis i walk forward and i grab scanlan and everybody and i back everybody up ten feet  laura try the ones that 
none	 arent trapped first please  sam all right im gonna quickly inspire him im gonna read him a limerick  matt go for it  sam i knew a goliath in whitestone who lived in a very very fine home  til one day a wizard or maybe a large lizard burned it and left him alone  liam okay so of the five at the top and the bottom and the middle its abyssal abyssal  dwarven and i checked those for traps and there arent any so im gonna unlock them all right so  for the top 
none	 one  sam you did the top already  liam check for traps or  all you unlocked it  matt you unlocked the top one and the latch came open without a problem  laura do the middle one  liam can i use what i just rolled for the middle one  travis make sure you disarm the other two  liam theres too many people talking i dont know whats going on i dont know whats going  on yeah i just rolled a ten twice and thats a 23  matt 23 clicking the middle one 
none	 opens creaking  liam now the bottom one shush  matt go for it  liam okay laughs 29  matt 29 the bottom one you its a different type of latch thats actually a rod that pushes  into the door you manage to find a break in the wood where its split and you put an instrument  and you pull the latch open so those three are now currently unlocked  laura try pushing the door  travis no no think of your team make sure theyre all disarmed  laughter  liam so heres where we 
none	 dont know whats going on we got number one number three and number  five are untrapped unlocked number two and number four are trapped but im just pushing the  door open  laura do whatever you want to do  liam but i dont have to make the decision on my own because youre all ten feet away from me  laura try disarming them sure why not do your thing  travis singing follow your heart dont blow up your head to solve those fucking locks do it  man  marisha youve got advantage so why 
none	 not fuck it  matt vax what is your choice what do you wish to do in this moment you have three untrapped  locks open two locks that seem to be trapped one of which said no  liam yeah im gonna open it  matt you push the door open as you push on the door the two locks on there give no resistance  seems they were both false locks and as the door opens you get the feeling that perhaps the traps were based  on the attempt to pick them or disarm  laura good 
dung	 job good job brother  ashley high five  liam no high fives  ashley just maybe just like a touch then  liam here  ashley okay  laughter  matt youre now looking into a familiar very dark hallway with very low light by a few torch sconces  that just flicker the material used to keep them burning pretty low and the embers are starting to  drift into a small pile of soot on the stone floor beneath them you can smell the remaining smoke  and scent of burning wood to the right of you 
none	 is a hallway that continues down to where spireling  modeth once lived before you cut his head off the doors are closed to that room and it curves off to  the left down a long hallway  to the left of where you currently are the hallway continues into darkness and turns around  the corner into shadow  liam okay so there was a cell that we were in and there was a larger room where we were  surrounded by modeth and a lot of people  ashley but there were a lot of hallways  
none	 taliesin do we smell anything  matt you smell the residue of burnt wood and tinder nothing beyond that  laura do i see any tracks that look like they could have been from an elf an old guy with some  battle scars  matt make a survival check  travis oh i could do those too can i help her with that  matt no sorry her ranger tracking training is far beyond anything you as a barbarian have  attempted though you are good at tracking naturally as a barbarian you could attempt to  make a 
none	 roll on your own but it wouldnt be helping her with it  laura 21  matt okay looking about the stone floor you do see scuff marks and where dust has been pushed  aside by boots many footfalls have come through this area but theres no way to really ascertain  any recent traffic or direction  laura i would have had to roll a 20 i bet  liam while were waiting im gonna throw my hood over one shoulder and im gonna undo my sleeves so  that oh the clasp is back here isnt it 
none	  laura just take your shirt off show it to the world im gonna cast pass without a trace on all  of us  marisha so wait are there two different directions  matt yeah so the right or the left  marisha can i ascertain if theres any type of draft or any  matt percival already tried that  marisha oh you already tried  liam so heres what im thinking i mean we could sneak through here and this ones going to  sound like a herd of  laura not necessarily i just cast pass 
none	 without a trace  sam dont disparage her shes wonderful and beautiful  liam our chances of sneaking through here are low i could try to talk us through this guys a  threat to them because the kingdom wants him and theyre housing him and that is not really  financially viable so i feel like perhaps we talk our way out of this we dont have to go in  banging an evil sword not that we have one  laura yeah were down here obviously we belong  liam i belong and i will vouch for you 
none	  laura beautiful lets do it  marisha i definitely would rather not fight the entire thieves guild  sam were not sneaking then cause if we did sneak we could dont you have fly or  something  liam were in a very thin hallway right now  sam all shed have to do is fly just off the  laura ive got no flying i used my only flying potion  sam all right all right so were talking our way out of it  liam im gonna call out im calling out member of the clasp entering 
none	 i need to parlay  matt a moment passes and you see stepping out of both sides of the hallway a number of hooded  figures five ten 15 individuals then begin to close in all hoods up cloaks around them you  can see through the dim light the crest of chins those of you that have darkvision you can see  some features they all are humanoid around human height a few that are smaller whether they be  younger or halfling or gnomish in origin you cant really make out their details in this  circumstance but 
town	 they all close in as you guys all stand there in the center of the hallway  liam i do start unlacing and i say im one of you and i show the tattoo on my back  matt as this happens you can see theres a part in the crowd and one much larger than the rest of  the members of the clasp steps forward pushing others out of the way you see a very thick square  jaw piercing out from underneath the shadowed hood and the hand pulls it back and as you can  now 
none	 see the crooked pointed ears snarling nose and underbite of a mostly orcish halforc one  youve encountered once before  liam its modeth  matt no no modeth was human you killed modeth the orc steps forward and looks about the group  and goes grunts seems like you stumbled into an early grave  liam i didnt stumble ive been here before ive a fucked up past with this organisation but  ive come to tell you and im pointing at the tattoo  matt he reaches out and grabs your arm and spins you around to look 
none	 at the tattoo on your back  violently like a ragdoll youre being treated like a child grunts releases you for a second  as you fall offbalance for a second but catch yourself he has his other hand at his belt side  and you can see what looks to be the the pommel of the dagger at the ready and he goes  liam sovereign uriel knows you have daxio here uriel wants him you are in danger this whole  organisation is in danger with him here  matt silence who else knows youre here  laura 
none	 not a soul  matt wait a second i do know you customs department wasnt it  sam ive been promoted since then im now a supervisor of it was a ruse i apologise for it  matt as we found out so you break back into our facility  laura we didnt exactly break in we just kind of im just shutting up  sam hes a member of the clasp he gained entry the way that you do  matt he brings in outsiders after being warned not to return with them yet you say you are here 
none	  for a who was it  liam do you care that the emperor knows youre holding a person he wants  matt he wont be held for long you can tell the emperor hes not a worry of ours soon  laura wheres he going  liam hes a traitor to the kingdom uriel wants him you are bringing danger upon this house  matt uriels useless  laura uriel has a lot of gold and will probably give a reward  matt laughs we have our hand in their coffers whether we get a reward or not  
none	 sam not the kind of reward hes already offering you we come bearing an offering from sovereign  uriel himself in exchange for this man i reach into my bag and i produce  ashley no gold no money  sam the very elegantly carved box i had made that contains the magical blue shard that we discovered  many many years ago and i open it just for a moment and close it and say this is the shard of  kara it is a magical item that can grant the user one wish any wish  laura but 
none	 scanlan you said we were going to keep that for ourselves  sam i did but its clear that this man knows who we are and why weve come  laura no  sam as a last resort we are cleared to offer this to you in exchange for your prisoner or is he  are you holding him as a prisoner or  matt he shushes you make a deception check  laura can i help him can i assist that  matt you know what you would be so go ahead and that would give you advantage on 
none	 this so  sam deception or persuasion  matt this is deception  sam 32  taliesin what in the living  matt let me see your box  laura oh well  matt hush  sam it is activated by a secret chant that we will only tell you once we are safe and the  prisoner or keep i dont know are you keeping him as a prisoner or  matt he waves his hand and shushes you  sam all right as soon as we get the man you get the chant  matt daxio huh huffs 
none	 he just paid us a rather large sum of money to produce documentation and  acquire transit to ankharel weve kept him here while weve prepared his documentation and were  to send him on his way through our tunnels to the docks so youre asking us to betray a client of  the clasp  liam and avoid the hammer of the empire  travis and keep the money at the same time  marisha sounds to me like you just won twice  matt he reaches his hand out for the box  sam where is he where 
none	 is he all right here you can inspect it scan it for magic if youd like  matt takes the box and hands it to one of his compatriots who takes it and inspects it and  pulls out a small glass puts it over his eye  marisha can i druidcraft a little bit and druidcraft a little bit of breeze seeping from the box  taliesin i pull out a small note that i hold in my right hand  matt make a sleightofhand check  marisha sleight of hand  laura ah damn it  marisha oh 
none	 did you see that that was awesome 21  matt 21 you mutter beneath your breath and swivel your hand for a second as he hands the other  individual inspecting it with the glass monocle looking piece whoosh wind drifts around it and  you can see the wood itself almost shimmer as if the grain of the wood is moving in a pattern  taliesin i hold up a beautiful elegant note that i show in my hand and put it in my breast pocket  matt very well we have him in holding awaiting his documents ill 
none	 show you ill leave the door  open well clear the halls do what you must we will not be involved you have an hour  laura thats all we need  matt what is your password  taliesin once he is free then you get in our custody then you get the note  laura well leave it outside the door  matt chuckles he puts his hand like this and other individuals of the clasp back out and leave  into the hallway behind you and he leads you to follow him and  marisha i say careful 
none	 do not open that box without the password or else it will melt your  eyeballs from inside your head  laughter  matt make a deception check  travis unnecessary  laura he was going for it  liam we had the mark  sam is this deception what is this  marisha 11  matt he takes a few steps and turns and looks at you  marisha you never know it acts in mysterious ways  matt box lid creaks  marisha oh shit  matt opens the box inspects the piece of blue crystal  marisha 
none	 can i druidcraft a gust coming out of it  matt i would not recommend it  marisha okay  matt he looks over at the gentleman who inspected it earlier and nods his head accepted and they  continue walking forward  travis lucky fucking druid  matt it is the piece you put in the actual  sam its a blue shard that we found in long long ago its real crystal and its real magic  matt yes i know what that is  sam because i dont  matt well it was sufficient upon inspection for 
none	 this  sam okay  laura whoa i think it opens a portal to another plane  sam i dont know what it is but its magic  marisha is it the one we got at last winters crest that one the one that we were using  shards of it to carve through dimensions cool  matt it had a few uses so as you guys move into the hallway a bunch of the clasp members leave  youre led down a couple of doors on the left and right you guys recognise these these are the  holding 
none	 cells that you guys were held shortly after your battle  ashley yep we were held in these cells  matt so the cell on the left is closed the cell on the right is closed he walks up to that cell  and without even a bit of noise pulls out a keyring unlocks it and puts the keys away  grunts turns around and the rest of the clasp scatter out of the hallway he puts the box away  in his cloak and he says one hour do as you must  liam i take the keys 
none	 weve got two to choose from  matt hes at the door he unlocked one for you guys  liam no no but theres two cells or has he opened the cell that hes in  matt there are three cells in this hallway the middle cell is the one that he led you to and  unlocked for you  liam okay thanks  matt and he steps away looks at the rest of you guys  travis there are five blocks on each side  matt  and then vanishes down the hallway so its now just you 
none	 guys in this hallway  laura did you give him the password  taliesin i have not given him the password yet  matt no because he already opened the box  liam daxio weve got your papers cmon  matt i just because i foresee something possibly happening here  laura i think we were saying the password made it work  travis i think he knows were full of shit  laura i think he knows its super powerful magic anyway and he doesnt give a shit and hes taking  it anyway  taliesin thats good because 
none	 man this was some bullshit  matt so all right so you guys are all gathered in this hallway who is standing where  taliesin where did he leave from  matt you guys entered this direction and they scattered this way  liam im going to lock eyes with grog and motion him towards one side of the door and im gonna take  the other  laura can you wall of stone the other side of the hallway just to block them from coming down that  hallway again can you block wall of stone that other side 
none	  marisha im going to go ahead and block in the entryway for good measure  matt right here  laura i thought the one he left through  matt okay they left this way okay so you wall this off  marisha yeah why not  matt there is now a wall of stone in the middle of that hallway  sam hope we dont have to leave that way but she can just dispel it  marisha i mean we can get it out  matt all right so who is standing where is there any particular placement 
none	 you guys wish to  travis vax and i are on either side of the door  matt all right so you guys are here all right  marisha so is this leading into something crazy  laura into his cell  marisha into a labyrinth or just his cell  matt as far so you know a cell  marisha as far as we know just a cell  laura he just completely took an expensive thing and left us to rot pretty much i think  matt anyone else want to change this arrangement  travis we are 
none	 in a giant death cluster how about we spread out a touch like two people to a door  in that hallway  sam all right ill take the other door  taliesin ill take the other door  laura ill go down with scanlan on the other one so i can ranged attack  travis im just saying if he took out a magical spectacle and knows were full of shit were all  gonna die  laura im gonna stand with my back against the wall that shes built up like that yeah  marisha did halforc dude 
none	 say he was just in this cell thats all he said  laura yeah  matt they essentially unlocked the cell theyre walking away theyre turning their heads and  letting you do what you want  ashley how do we know thats the one that hes in  liam we dont  taliesin lets find out  sam why dont you go in and kill some shit  matt everyones good with this arrangement  marisha is there any other entrances or anything else around  matt theres just this door and this door and theyre both currently  
none	 marisha fine go for it  liam and i called out already  travis i would like to rage  matt okay let us go ahead for the sake of this roll initiative depending on what happens going  forward just so we have that  sam just in case eh  travis just because i have a fear of construction paper advantage  taliesin what did construction paper do to you  travis what did it not do  matt all right so 25 to 20  liam 25  taliesin 25  laura 26  matt 20 to 
none	 15  travis 17  matt 15 to ten  marisha 14  sam 14  matt and what did ashley get  travis nine of course  matt okay i would expect nothing less  taliesin i like to think that she looks both ways before attacking just to see  matt all right so you rage  travis i rage  matt whos doing what now  marissa vax is our point man  liam were both at the door and i called out so i guess well wait a moment to see if hell  matt a 
none	 moment passes  travis you want to check i can open the door  liam well i already went stealth earlier too i got a 25 on the stealth check i can go again if  you want  matt do you want to try and stealth in the room  liam if we wait like 30 seconds and nothing happens  matt nothing happens yeah okay make another stealth check  liam no 21 im doing nothing im just standing in place  travis he thinks youre going in  matt so as you push in the doorway quietly 
none	 you see for a moment inside you can see theres a  little bit of light from overheard in the room that lights it up you see in the distance what  looks to be a latrine in the far corner and as soon as you peek in the doorway you glance out  the side of your eyeline and you immediately see a figure and a flash of metal  liam okay ill use uncanny dodge then  matt all right  liam unless its an area effect if its an area effect ill use evasion  matt no 
none	 it is a direct attack as a giant metallic glaive comes down to you that is going  to be a 19 to hit  liam that hits  matt all right that is 18 points of piercing im sorry slashing damage  liam nine points with the uncanny dodge  matt okay at this point now you reveal the interior and right here at the door you see  there standing daxio right before you armored up sweat on the brow holding what looks to be a  large glaive a halberdtype weapon with a giant bladed tip which 
none	 whack strikes you and gets  back in defensive position you i knew it  laura isnt he old  matt daxios a mature elf  liam can i move and then hold my turn can i move at all hold the actions  matt youve moved in you could ready your action if youd like  liam yeah thats what im saying could i just use my movement and then wait  matt you could if youd like  liam yeah thats what im going to do im going to circle around and im never going to leave him 
none	  im going to go all the way around circle him and then wait and then my trigger is when grog  steps up to him  matt you cant move through other creatures in this place and area  liam oh i cant go around him  matt no he has you blocked off at the doorway and has like squared off with you right now with  the glaive  liam is grog considered five feet away from him  matt grog is considered five feet away from you yes  liam oh then im going to sneak 
none	 attack him  matt not five feet away from him  liam from me  matt in order to sneak attack a creature you have to have an ally adjacent to the enemy not to  you the idea is theyre being harried by two different points and cant form a good defense  liam okay all right then im going to use disengage im going to step five feet back im  going to use one action to click my boots of haste and then can i attack because the boots  are on after that then ill throw 
none	 a dagger at him  matt okay  liam that is a 24  matt 24 does hit  liam all right 11 from the keen dagger  matt all right cool  matt all right we have now officially as of this moment entered combat you technically would  be next in the initiative round at this point but youre holding your action until what are you  holding your action until  liam i was only going to do that if you told me that i could move around him now that i know that i cant  
none	 matt all right you did that okay okay never mind gotcha all right cool so that will be in  theory the first opening to the battle now we start the initiative order all right so now  were starting off vex youre up first  laura i call out daxio dont be a moron step outside and lower your weapon youre surrounded  matt make an intimidation check  sam you were using your deep voice so you could  laura my deep voice  sam you could get advantage  laura to intimidate him more 13  matt 
none	 13 okay you shout it out and it echoes through the hallway who knows if its landed or  had an effect you cant see him from your current perspective  laura should i walk forward or should i keep  travis hes in there by himself and no other are enemies  laura i mean as far as we know  sam why dont you check the other door  liam whoevers in there is locked in there  laura yeah im just going to im going to stay where i am i guess  matt all righty so 
none	 you stay there next up is vax and percy  liam im going to disengage and back up against the back wall  matt youve already disengaged  liam already have all right so im going to back up and hold  matt okay so you back up you notice at this point as you step five feet back that that weapon  hes carrying is pretty long and has a pretty decent reach you may have to disengage to get out  of there without taking another strike  liam but if i were to go left or right 
none	 would i be out of range of hitting him because of the  doorway  matt you would be over here probably yeah  liam so if i move sideways either way i cant hit him  matt correct  liam so im not going to do that im going to just step back against the back wall and hold  matt are you using your disengage action or not  liam was i within five feet of him  yes im going to use disengage  matt okay so you use your bonus action to disengage because youre not 
none	 used to fighting  these long polearm weapons as you begin to take another step back you realize he can actually hit  you from further away than you expect  laura oh can i have used my bonus action to hide  matt sure go ahead and roll stealth all right and now youre going to go ahead and  laura natural 20  matt okay you vanish hold until what what do you want to be the trigger  liam until grog steps in  matt okay all right next up is percy  taliesin is there a 
none	 grille on that door any kind of  matt no it is a solid door  taliesin it is a solid door  matt it is currently open but  taliesin oh no i mean on the door that im next to  matt oh no that is closed that is a solid door  taliesin im going to hold im going to stay where i am and hold my action until i see somebody  i want to shoot in the hallway  matt okay good to know all right that brings us to grog  travis i bellow 
none	 out youre in for the fight of your life if you dont drop your polearm the next  thing that hits the ground if you dont will be your skull  matt are you using your action to intimidate  travis yes  matt okay go ahead and roll an intimidate check  sam dont you have some sort of intimidate thing  matt hes not in a frenzied rage though  travis no but ill take craven edge out and leave him unsheathed which gives me an advantage  on intimidation checks  17  matt 17 okay you 
none	 can see now with the blade forward sweat dripping down his face this look  of a cornered animal and as the sword comes out with a ringing sound in the air the shadows  coalesce around the black obsidian blade he gives you a look and hes questioning his current  circumstance but seems to be holding firm  travis what do i have left of my turn anything  matt you have your bonus action and your move  travis bonus action bonus action whats a bonus action what can i do  laura i dont know what 
none	 you can do  matt if youre in frenzied rage it would be another attack but  travis no that makes me tired as shit no i wont do anything else  matt okay you stay there all righty now being his turn daxio is just going to curve around the  side looking at you with the glaive in position responding to your intimidating act takes the  blade and swirls it around and goes for your legs so thats going to be a 21 to hit  travis thatll hit  matt all righty this is going to 
none	 be as the glaive sweeps under your legs trying to gash  across thats eight points of slashing damage  travis halved because im raging  matt plus an additional five points from his superiority die  travis from his what  sam superiority  matt hes attempting to trip you go ahead and make a strength saving throw  travis do i have  matt ability checks not your saving throws  travis strength checks and strength saving throws advantage  matt is that what it says  travis yeah advantage on all strength checks and strength saving throws 
none	  matt then yeah you would have advantage on this  travis haha 26  matt 26 you stand firm in your position the blade strikes and gashes open a part of your shin  but you just hold your place there leaning against the wall for support doesnt affect you  travis so 13 total halved so seven  matt mmhm next is going to you know what hes going to go ahead and attempt to strike you  two more times that is going to be a 16 to hit  travis misses  matt and this one 
none	 is going to take a minus five on that one that was a oh okay all right  thats 24  travis thatll hit  matt all right this is going to be a great weapon master strike so this is 20 points of  slashing damage halved to ten and is going to hold firm in his current position daring anyone  to come near yeah holding this pincher point keyleth youre up  marisha okay im going to peek around grog and try and cast hold person on him  matt okay whats the dc on that  
none	 marisha 18 just my spell dc right  matt okay well that is 17 however he is going to use indomitable to reroll a saving throw  marisha aw  matt that is going to be a 20 so as you finish the spell you can see his head beginning to be  affected and he shrugs it off through sheer force of will anything else you want to do on your turn  taliesin this guys annoying  marisha no ah yes  matt okay that ends keyleths turn scanlan youre up  marisha i just said yes no 
none	 wait i dont have it i dont have it nope never mind no go  matt scanlan what are you doing  sam i cant see him yet or i can  matt no not right now you just see this blade going whoosh whoosh out the doorway  sam and i saw keyleth cast that spell yeah  matt correct yes  sam i run up a little closer to be in visual range yeah  matt there you can see him yeah  sam and i will do the same fucking thing and ill cast hold person on 
none	 him as well with my hand  cone of clarity  matt your hand cone that is a natural one  cheering  matt hes going to use his other use of indomitable to attempt to reroll that  sam he has two  matt two but this is his last one that brings him to a 19  sam 19  matt just beats your dc  marisha he has to make a wisdom saving throw  matt yeah  marisha oh is that what he was doing against my spell save is that what it is  sam 
none	 damn  matt wait no that is a 17 sorry i misdid the math so it does go through him so as you finish  the hold person he groans locks up into place tense his eyes darting around with an angry fury  anything else you want to do  sam i will with my bonus can i talk to him  matt yeah  sam i will say hey man just give up already come on come on thats my intimidation  matt make an intimidation check  sam 21  matt 21 he seems visibly shaken by 
none	 the presence of the two of you and the fact that he cant move  right now thats the best i can give you at the moment  laura can we take his weapon from him since he cant move  matt all right that ends your turn i believe pike  ashley okay can i intimidate him to give me his weapon  sam he cant move  ashley he cant move can i go up and try to take his weapon  matt if you want to one two three four five so you step up into the 
none	 hallway and you walk up  to him and hes looking at you sweat dripping down his face hair matted across the side of his chin  laura do it pike  marisha do it  matt what are you doing  ashley please give me your weapon  laughter  matt roll an intimidation check  sam get more flies with honey  ashley fuck well its probably not going to work with a four  matt with a four the eyes though frozen he still manages to roll his eyes as the armored  gnome walks up and 
none	 requests his weapon and is no longer paying attention  ashley can i just take it from him  matt go ahead and make a strength check just roll and add your strength modifier  laura thats good  ashley 18  laura oh wait it might be higher than that no  ashley 18  matt 18 you go and grab and all the muscles tensed up its like a vice grip and as you pull  and pull and pull to no avail youre unable to wrestle it from his grasp that ends your turn  back up 
none	 vex  laura all right i guess i walk look at us all bunched up in this little hall  matt yeah this is a bad circumstance for a party  laura im going to stay where i am and im going to just call out youre being really stupid  obviously you are outnumbered you are frozen you should probably just you know give up  ashley you have him held  sam hes held and also we probably cant tell if hes giving up because he probably cant talk  laura okay until grog i want to hold 
none	 my action until grog gets him to move until he moves out of  matt okay what action do you want to hold what are you going to do  laura do i have to say what im going to  matt i want to know what youre readying essentially  laura i want to if anything attacks us i want to be able to attack it  matt okay good to know same percy all right then vax same  liam im going to wait to see what grog does as soon as grogs done im throwing  matt 
none	 grog what are you doing  travis can i squeeze by pike or do i need to pick her up and move her out of the way  matt technically being held doesnt threaten the square and you can probably walk around pike so  you can get into the room id say right now because he cant really defend it or keep you at  bay with his weapon  travis walk thats cute i would like to run past pike and bearform tackle him  matt okay all right so were doing a full  travis full shoulder 
none	 in the gut wrapping my arms around his legs picking him up and throwing him  on the ground  laura dont you wish we had trinket now  sam oh its like football drills running into a what are those things called  travis guys standing up and youre just driving into him with your whole body mass  liam why do we need trinket we have a small giant  matt all right go ahead and make an athletics check  travis okay yes 19  matt 19 thats fine he cant even defend at this point so 
none	 you push him back five feet and you  manage to push your way into this and shove him further into the room  travis but not to the ground  marisha he wanted to take him to the ground  travis yeah i wanted to tackle him and be on top of him  matt yeah you know what impact sound on the ground and you are right over lording the space  okay that all youre going to do on your turn  travis i cant attack right thats all i got  taliesin you can move  
none	 travis no ill stay there  liam are we able to tell from what grog just did what he does does he react does he just go grunts  matt he just falls over because he cant move his muscles  laura can we move his muscles or is he frozen  sam you mean use him like weekend at bernies  laura can we handcuff him while hes frozen  marisha thats what i was going to say can we tie him tie him up  matt you can attempt to if you get to him on your turn 
none	  ashley hogtie him  matt grog you finish your turn comes to daxios turn daxios attempting to resist thats a  natural 20  laura werent you holding your turn until grog moved him  liam until grog did his thing yeah but i wanted to see what happened so it would be after this  matt right so as daxio is on the ground muscles lax for a second and looks up at you and cant do  anything because that was his turn but is no longer seemingly affected by the ability and just  looks up 
none	 at you with eyes flicking around with thoughts and trying to formulate a plan here  travis yeah like what you see dont you  matt vax what did you want to do  liam all right so im hasted because i did the boots so im going to use haste to climb through  my friends over pike under grogs legs and im going to im going to flip daggers over and im  going to bean this guy in the face a couple of times should be a sneak attack the first time  because of grog being 
none	 there  matt make an acrobatics check  liam all right that is 30  matt 30 landing on the opposite side of the room on the other side of daxio you jump off of  grogs back land and go for your attack  liam all right im going to bluntedge him three times  matt you have advantage on these attacks because hes currently prone on the ground  liam so the first one is a natural 20 thats also sneak attack so that doesnt get quadrupled  does it its already doubled from sneak attack  matt 
none	 correct well no no its doubled because its a critical hit thats all  laura oh right sneak attack you just get the additional six remember  liam yeah okay so and then the second one is a 23  matt 23 both hit  liam okay and did i use all my movement to climb through the scrum or do i have my third attack  matt the movement wouldnt affect your attack at all your movement is just your movement action  liam so i do have a third attack then  matt you would in theory yes 
none	  liam okay so thats 17  matt 17 does hit yes  liam okay so the first one blunt using the end is  laura and then add your six  liam 11 two three seven ten 15 19  matt 19 times two  liam 19 times two right is 38 plus the seven so 46 for the first  matt 46 points of damage  liam thats blunt though and two plus six is eight on the second and seven on the third  matt all right got it so as you slam the daggers into each 
none	 side of his head you can see  cracking the side of the temple blood beginning to pour out the side of where the impact hit hes  staggered momentarily from the impact but after the third strike hit manages to bring the glaive  up to try and defend himself at this point that would be it that ends your turn that brings us  liam did i use all my movement to get there all of it  matt you could try and get away if you like with haste you would have more movement yeah  liam 
none	 ill take ill go back ten feet see what happens hes on his back so he could probably  take a swing at me  matt he tries to but its with disadvantage  liam all right yeah  matt yeah rolled a two that whoomph hits the tile all right that brings us to keyleth  marisha hes down on the ground  matt yeah  laura gasps  marisha i was going to say i can okay yeah ill go ahead and vine him  matt grasping vine to where  marisha to oh right because its got 
none	 to be against a wall  travis it cant be the ground  marisha can it be the ground  matt it can probably be the ground if you want to yeah  marisha yeah can i essentially just entangle him into the ground  matt sure lets give it a shot so fourth level grasping vine all right dexterity saving throw  which he has a disadvantage on that is a failure all right so is now groans and  taliesin while prone  marisha yeah hes down  taliesin thats hot  matt so technically the spell doesnt 
none	 grapple it just pulls things towards it it just moves  things around the battlefield  marisha yeah thats right  matt so the vine pulls him closer to the ground  marisha can i do entangle instead and just do a concentrated entangle  matt entangle would affect the entire floor of that room yeah grasping vine the vines around  him you dont know how much of an effect itll have when it comes to his turn but youll find out  laura it may help  sam you did great  matt it was also your bonus 
none	 action you can still use your action to cast another second level if  you wanted to  sam cast speak with animals  laura commune with nature  marisha i mean i can try and hold person him again do we want to do that i can hold person  him again  sam we want to hear what he has to say i think at this point  marisha can i do a druidcraft matt a druidcraft where i druidcraft a vine around his ankles  matt sure  marisha oh okay cool  matt out of the 
none	 grasping vine a little vine goes around the legs its more of a grapevine a  really pretty to grow plant life on  marisha a grapevine grapevines are pretty hard  travis a white or red grapevine  matt a red one okay scanlan youre up  sam me jesus hey hey dude come on can you give up please can you please give up im just  going to intimidate him again  matt okay roll an intimidation check  laura come on roll so high  sam ah that was a dead roll that was the same 
none	 roll but not wonky this is intimidate 22  matt okay you get the sense now that these rounds of perpetual pressuring daxio and now  recovering his position in this fight and you guys have stepped into this room with him hes become  less of a sensible individual and more of a desperate man lashing out as a last stand and  your intimidation shouts are falling upon deaf ears  sam okay  matt does that end your turn  sam i dont know is that my action  matt id say because youre already there and 
none	 shouting at him it can be a bonus action so if  you want to take your action still  sam i cant do anything im behind all those fucking people well if were fighting then i  cant do much i will just i will blind him this time  matt okay  sam can i do that  matt sure  sam ill blind him at a level three  matt ooh level three blind  travis blind him  sam blind  taliesin with science  matt at level three just means you can target an additional 
none	 creature  sam i know i just dont have any level two slots  matt okay so spend it no worries all right so thats a constitution saving throw that is a 19  sam thats 19 so he saves  matt yeah so he saves unfortunately  laura this guy sucks  sam oh wait i can blind one other person  matt if you want to  sam nah no i wont  matt all right pike youre up  ashley oh jeez i dont know what to do so intimidating is not working  laura no  
none	 ashley cant we just take him out of there now that hes all tied up  matt hes not tied up the vine grabbed around but doesnt appear to be really changing his  physicality  ashley okay can i make with my spiritual weapon a sort of holding like a  matt its a weapon spiritual weapon weapons in the name what kind of weapon would you want to  summon  ashley i want to make a lasso again a lariat maybe with a little stinger on the end just to  listen  matt all right a 
none	 little lasso there  ashley so his arms  matt well well have to see  ashley if it works  matt so go ahead and roll and add your spell attack it has advantage because hes prone still  ashley that would be a natural 20  cheering  matt hes also now grappled  ashley hes also now grappled okay can the stinger go right here to his neck  matt sure its right there the spiritual energy wraps around the body hes held there with the  vine both holding him there the stinger swish up over 
none	 the throat  laura brother come on what are you gonna do  travis we take him the fuck out of here  ashley yeah we got to take him out yeah  matt that the end of your turn  ashley yeah but i can still has he dropped his weapon no  matt the weapons still clutched to him and wrapped  ashley can i try to intimidate him with my extra bonus attack and tell him to drop his weapon  matt you get the sense he cant drop it because hes currently everythings wrapped up to 
none	 him  between the lasso and the vine and intimidation doesnt seem to affect him anymore  ashley okay  laura how long does the spiritual weapon last  matt its concentration so can be a number of rounds as long as she uses her bonus action to  maintain it  ashley so concentrated  matt yes i would recommend it vex  laura me okay oh no should i go in the room  taliesin rooms kind of busy in my opinion  laura i feel like i dont want to i just okay you know what im 
none	 gonna hunters mark him  matt so youre gonna get over you still cant see him at that distance unfortunately  laura seriously  matt youve stayed at the far back um so  laura well then fuck it im gonna just stay where i am  taliesin yeah lets keep point  laura im gonna keep point im gonna stay at the back of the hallway just in case  matt all right vax percy  laura again still hiding  liam okay ive still got daggers turned around im gonna knock this fool out okay yeah and you 
none	  guys are right on top of him so first one is and advantage because hes grappled and down right  matt correct  liam so first one is 22 second one is a natural 20 third one is 20  matt all right so go for it all three attacks hit  liam all right so the first one is regular attack  matt well you cant choose which one is the sneak attack  liam well there is no sneak attack oh yeah yeah i meant that the critical was on the second  one thats what i 
none	 meant  matt yeah no worries  liam so the first one is 11 plus double this 11 plus four eight 12 15 16 22 so thats 44 plus  laura you dont double it  liam oh the second ones the critical attack thank you 22 plus seven is 30 i have three  attacks 31 second one is thats easy 14 and the third attack is ten the second one was  critical but much smaller  matt all right fighting sounds you slam down on the face you can see nose actually breaks  under the blunt 
none	 of the weapon and blood begins to pour out of his nostrils and hes fighting now  and coughing up  laura whos gonna tie him up whos in the fucking room  liam and im gonna jump back ten feet again  laura and pull him out of the room anyone  matt and percy youre holding  taliesin im holding  matt all righty grog  travis im gonna take manacles out of the bag of holding since hes holding his arms are pinned  to his chest and im gonna clasp it on both of his wrists 
none	 and then im gonna pick that  motherfucker up on my shoulder and walk out of the room id like to try  ashley and i can help  matt you can by just controlling it with your mind so i will say go ahead and make an  athletics check just to  travis strength or athletics  matt thisd be athletics athletics is better for you technically  travis yeah it is 20  matt yeah you lift him over your shoulder past pike take him out into the hallway you gonna  keep him on your shoulder 
none	 or slam him down  travis yeah i was gonna slam him into the wall  matt wham whack into the wall go ahead and roll 1d6 plus your strength modifier for the  sheer force of this this near currently helpless individual slammed against the stone wall  travis seven  matt all right  laura can i toss grog my some of the infinite rope and tell him to tie him up tie up his ankles too  matt as youre holding sure so vex yells out to you and throws you the source of the infinite rope 
none	  you grab and begin to if you want to start tying up all right  ashley loot tying i mean rage tying  matt rage tying  laughter  matt all right great now it comes to daxios turn hes currently trying to resist the current  grappling and your attempt to tie him thats gonna be a natural 20 on athletics check  laura yeah but hes got his ankles tied up  sam not no more he dont  matt yeah the manacles are there you turn was to lift him up and slam him into the 
none	 wall and  youre beginning to wrap him up his turn immediately afterward is he breaks out of the  lasso  travis the spirit weapon  matt the spirit weapon lasso and at that point still manages to grunts get back with half the  movement onto his feet  taliesin i cant take my turn now can i  matt you can after this he still has the manacles on which holding the polearm now  wouldnt do too much of a disadvantage to him so i say this round it doesnt do anything  marisha i know 
none	 itd be a close grip  matt the grips pretty tight  laura he wouldnt be able to get a firm grip on the swing itd be like  liam let him be a hardass  marisha as a fight as a staff user thats  matt all right so disadvantage on attacks with this but theyre all against keyleth  laughter  ashley oh no  marisha you know what bring it bitch  matt all right so daxio gets up seeing grog had taken the majority of the attacks and looking over  at the druid that made 
none	 the vine curl and drag him to the ground turns over and  marisha sup  matt makes three strikes against you the first one is going to be all right so that is a 15  marisha miss  matt all right second one natural one on the second roll metals clinking against the wall  third one is going to be a 17  marisha 17 is exactly what he needed  matt 17 does hit all right its going to try and tripattack you so you take as this third  strike 12 points of slashing damage 
none	 and make a strength saving throw  marisha 15  matt 15 with that slams it around and hits you right about the kneecap the blade hits the armor  and it guards most of it but the sheer force of the impact knocks you off your feet and you land  facedown on the ground in front with that daxio uses the momentum of the strike to  and use the action surge ability hes gonna do three more strikes against your nowprone self  with disadvantage and youre prone so each attack has no disadvantage against you  
none	 marisha yeah  matt thats a natural 20  laura gasps  matt first one and these are all great weapon master this ones gonna be a 23 and this is  gonna be a 18 and this one is a 21 so all three hit  marisha uhhuh  ashley i got you girl  marisha is this all for that staff comment  matt its pretty harsh but also given the circumstance that you were from his perspective  the one that was trying to hold him in place too and grog hasnt taken much visual impact from 
none	 the  blows youre the one thats currently protecting him from rushing off in that direction say what  you want but anyway that is  laughter  matt 30 points of slashing damage from the first strike thats the critical  marisha uhhuh laughs  matt the next one is 24 points of slashing damage  taliesin oh god  matt and this last one is 21 points of slashing damage  ashley shes out  taliesin no shes standing or i mean shes not but  matt that ends daxios turn youre up keyleth  taliesin oh wait 
none	  matt oh yeah percy youre making your action thats right  taliesin im gonna pull grit shot to the hands with the new pistol  laura with the new weapon  sam that might explode  taliesin thats a 21 to hit  matt that hits  taliesin all right drop it  matt make a strength saving throw  taliesin let me doublecheck  matt no i made a change to that because thats gonna be a 21  taliesin against my  matt against the dc for all your other abilities so im pretty sure that he 
none	 resists it  taliesin against my dc  matt against your dc yeah so you take your first shot it does damage it does no damage this is the  taliesin no this does no damage i dont know what my dc is  matt i think for this one if i look at the change i made for the update on the gunslinger  let me go ahead and check real fast stay with me folks  sam is this gun called little sparky  matt its the arms you said right  taliesin hands yeah  matt actually 
none	 no i did not change this one he doesnt get a saving throw he drops it no  damage  clapping  matt so as keyleth is on the ground being hacked by this glaive he lifts up again for another  brutal strike and shooting sound this echoing blast sound hits as the glaive is knocked out of  his hands  marisha i just go to my earpiece and i go thank you percy  taliesin did we are we going to go with that discussion we had about the torso shot or are we  dropping that 
none	 for now dropping it for now totally okay in that case im just going to take  two sharpshooter shots to drag him down a little bit  matt okay  taliesin thats 18 19 20 27 to hit  matt 27 hits  taliesin that does god new gun there we are thats six 22 points of damage  sam yeah little sparky  taliesin and thats 17 to hit  matt 17 to hit yeah just hits  taliesin and thats 23 points of damage and thats all she wrote  matt all right how do you want 
none	 to do this  gasps  laura wait wait keep him alive  travis i dont think we have a chance now  taliesin well we do  marisha fucking dick he deserves it  taliesin i want to take both of those shots and try and graze his collarbones with both those  shots itll heal but hes gonna have a really hard time lifting his arms for like the next  couple months  matt okay so with those shots gunshot a splash of blood with bits of splintered bone come  shooting out of the halfplate armor 
none	 hes been wearing as the metal itself blows open from the  impact of the first blast with the glaive still clinking to the ground behind him and him reacting  the first impact sends him back and he leans against the wall looks up to see the source of  the impact looks into your eyes for a second and before he has a moment of reaction the second  blast comes out gunshot shattering the other part of the clavicle you can now see the armor  sundered on each shoulder and blood beginning to pour over the 
none	 sides of where the armors been  torn he slumps to the ground groaning  taliesin youre lucky itll even heal  matt panting do what you must but i am his blood his dominion will call back call me back  when everything else has fallen into nothing  laura are you talking about dres vecna are you talking about vecna  matt low chuckle  laura oh thats a yes  taliesin oh yeah that didnt go very well im afraid you might be out of luck  liam weve got about 50 more minutes in here what 
none	 say we drag this asshole out of here  laura lets get this fucker out of here  taliesin grog tie him up and lets get you do you need  marisha yeah keyleth gets up and bleeding from my mouth and i just take him and i grab him by  his face and i just say fucking traitor and i spit a big glob of blood in his face  taliesin and shes the nice one  marisha its true laughs  travis i pick him up i put him over my shoulder and we start to walk
