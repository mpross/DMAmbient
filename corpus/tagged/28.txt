click tv static  groovy critical role theme  matt and welcome back last we left off the mighty nein had gotten caught up with some  interesting folks the knights of requital who had hoped to help shift the political balance in  the city remove the framing and forging of equipment of materials and letters some of the  corrupt individuals of the /none/ local government they had gone out into the evening infiltrated a few of  the homes and left this information behind gotten in a few scuffles leaving one of them the  highrichter dead and shortly after there was an attack on the trispire what are you looking at  sam god damn it  liam thats it youre in the clear  matt ill remember this laughs noticing there was seemingly an attack upon the trispire by two  xhorhasian assassintype individuals you met with one in the sewer trying to escape from being seen  by the local /town/ guard during this confrontation and did battle with a crick warrior of some kind you  subdued it removed most of its equipment and conflicted over this strange artifact this beacon  that it was carrying sent it on its way however it was quickly caught by the guard and killed you  met on the surface the guard that were bringing the corpse and the object along managed to spirit  away the strange dodecahedron from the grasp of the town guard and absconded with it you met with  dolan and horris whore currently trying to figure out /none/ what to do in case they were somehow  implicated with the events of the evening you took horris under your wing promising dolan that  you would somehow smuggle him out of the city as its currently on lockdown during this  investigation you all then managed to try and find some sort of lead on what the next step would  be went toward the evening nip apparently to seek possibly this individual known as the gentlemen of  which you have heard of previously as kara one of the members of the knights of requital who had /dung/  vanished seemingly had some sort of connection there so you entered the evening nip the rather  dark and strange interior of the small dive bar gave the previously discovered words the code  words that allowed you entry and were led down a long spiral staircase beneath the establishment  into a subterranean bar upon which after immediately stepping into the space a  blackfurred female tabaxi approached mollymauk over here and with a look of recognition said  lucien and then embraced you and thats where we left off  travis shouting fucking insight check on taliesin /none/ no im kidding  matt so as you guys all watch this darkfurred tabaxi giving this big strong hug around  mollymauks shoulders pulls away and looks at you and goes it has been too long two ye  taliesin far too long  matt two years laughs look at you you grew out your hair  taliesin ah yes its been quite an interesting two years  matt and you are covered in tattoos  taliesin well catch up we need a table we need drinks for me and my compatriots  matt of course you these are your /tavern/ friends now  taliesin its a long story and i cant tell you everything right now you know how it is  matt very well as the tabaxi turns around you can see there is posted right off to the right and  around the corner a hulking figure that has leaned around the edge that leads into this lshaped  tavern a hefty muscular ogre that is wearing patchwork hide armor and holding a giant maul  resting on the ground looks back around the corner with these beady dark eyes and large  looming jaw with angry broken /none/ teeth protruding from underneath going snorts looks at the rest  of you other folks around are looking a bit confused at your entry right immediately to your  left is a table with a roughandtumble looking cutthroat sitting there eating a sandwich with a  halfdrunken drink whos chewing slowly with this glare of mistrust in your direction there are two  balconies up above you in the chamber you now get a better look up at the top there are a number of  individuals posted and some of them appear to be drinking but there is at /dung/ least one of them  immediately in your view who has two skulking looking individuals with long dark cloaks and dark  armor carrying what looks almost like a heavy crossbow but its a long metal rod youve only seen  them in use here and there but these are some sort of a riflelike firearm that are usually  reserved for the armies and bladegarden and to the far east of xhorhas a recently emerging  technology that has been largely guarded within use of the empire itself  taliesin literally everything coming back to haunt me okay cool /tavern/  travis if we had to ballpark it how many persons would you say are in this  matt 13 or so people in this tavern including the bartender the individual who rushed  to you as you entered and various patrons around that you can get a quick bead on  taliesin the second she turns im going to turn and give fjord a little pat on the back and make a  whisper really quickly  matt okay  sam make a whisper  taliesin yeah im gonna whisper in fjords ear im sorry this is my nightmare /tavern/ please just go  with it its lucien and im back around pass it on  matt okay which as soon as you say that you back away and look right behind fjord as you all  are standing there theres yasha  sam oh what  taliesin nervous laugh  sam just at the bar  matt no right behind you as if she had just come down the stairs with you  sam what  taliesin yasha  sam shrieks  ashley hey so  taliesin im apparently lucien from two years ago from two years ago its /tavern/ lucien remember  its been ages  ashley okay its been a minute hey you guys walked right past me in the bar upstairs so i  decided to  liam you are like a bad penny  sam we did not walk right past you we looked around youre big we would have seen you  ashley ive been right behind you the whole time i dont know how you didnt know i was here  taliesin im so glad to see you  ashley im glad to see you too mollymauk  taliesin its lucien its lucien  /tavern/ ashley its lucien  liam theres nothing private about our situation at all right theres people everywhere  matt well theres people all throughout the tavern but theres some music playing theres  two musicians that are in the process of plucking away at two instruments everyone seems further in  the chamber rather absorbed in their current rigmarole but you guys have just stepped down the  stairs you havent left the stairs you are literally standing right at the entrance of this  tavern and youve all been taken aback by that encounter the realization that yasha had /none/ followed  you down the stairs and whatever is about to transpire  taliesin ill explain later just go with it please  marisha oh yasha followed us she wasnt starting down here  matt no  marisha gotcha  travis i dont mind rolling with this name lucien but does it bring any extra trouble with it  taliesin i dont know well find out  travis fair enough  taliesin just go with it ill explain later  travis all right  liam and it all makes sense to you  taliesin ill explain later  marisha this /none/ club is awesome  taliesin i hate you  sam do i have to change my name in this club  marisha are we all supposed to change our names  sam we should all come up with different names  taliesin it might be easier just to have them all killed right now i didnt say that out loud i  didnt say that out loud im just thinking out loud oh god its going to be fine im not  panicking  marisha and taliesin lets go get drinks  matt at this point a hand claps and /none/ the tabaxi is now at one of the tables and has shooed off one  of the drinks and goes this way i found a table for everyone  taliesin come sit down i give the tabaxi another hug as we sit down how have you been  its been ages  matt oh too long i apologize for using your old name nonagon it is a pleasure to see you again  travis not a chance i didnt catch that at all  matt nonagon was what you heard  marisha nonagon  sam thats the tabaxi not the /none/ ogre  matt no the tabaxi said that  taliesin thats my name  marisha wait  travis lucien nonagon  matt basically what was said was im sorry for saying your old name nonagon was correcting  lucien to mollymauk  marisha wait is nonagon like a slang for or like a word for sorry  matt you dont know  taliesin who can keep track these days again a long story  matt nonagon what happened we watched you die  taliesin that is a story for another day and another drink what did you see god i /none/ dont  know what that looked like from the other end of things  matt well it all went belly up two years ago you told us to scatter and vanish if it didnt  if things went wrong and wait until you returned we buried your ass in the woods outside of the  hideout i mean   taliesin it may not have necessarily been my ass that you buried  matt apparently  taliesin i had a few tricks up my sleeve  matt laughs well that spellspitter lady from the capital she said you were gone /none/ she  took the book and left and her contract said she was in the right and that we knew better than  to go toe to toe with her and her ilk  taliesin obviously is everybody else all right i know it has been a while i had to stay  underground  matt unfortunately jurrel met with the axe of the law shortly after you left us  taliesin damn shame  matt zoran ottis and tyffial have all scattered amongst the empire  taliesin damn shame  matt but do you want me to find the /none/ others  taliesin no actually im  matt i know where tyffial is  taliesin where is tyffial i would rather obviously deliver everything in person honestly  if i had known you were here i wouldve made arrangements i didnt want to shock you  matt shes up in nogvurot we can travel there i can send a message and have her come down to us  taliesin im working on something very delicate i need everything to be very quiet  matt very well nonagon  liam i apologize im not very observant i missed your name  /none/ taliesin where are my manners  matt my apologies my name is cree  liam cree  matt i am a member of the well the family around how much do they know  sam we know a lot  ashley we pretty much know all of it so  sam we were told the name of the group that you traveled with but i cant remember it now  taliesin they dont know a lot but theyre trustworthy ive been putting my trust in them so far  ashley i do i know all of it so you can /none/ just tell me if you want to  taliesin thats actually fair  matt make a deception check both of you  sam me  matt yeah  sam im the worst 13  taliesin technically advantage because its kind of the truth  matt technically all right sure ill give you that  ashley i got a ten but technically i know im rolling at advantage  taliesin yeah i think thats advantage i begged for advantage on that one  matt ill give you that  ashley 16  taliesin okay thank you  matt well we were /none/ all part of the same order at one point and we splintered off luci nonagon  had a different path in mind for us so we went north to shady creek run and we started the tomb  takers its just so good to see you  taliesin its good to be seen again but again its got to be very quiet right now its been  like three other names since the last time i saw you  matt i should inform the others  taliesin please keep it quiet for now that book caused more trouble than you /none/ think and it all  laid on my shoulders i was trying to protect the rest of you from some of the worst elements of  that and i dont want any heat dropping on anybody who doesnt know whats coming yet  matt of course  taliesin but let me know where they are and ill get a hold of them but dont let them know why yet  matt the tabaxi curls in a little bit leans over the table towards you with this big grin and says  does this mean that it worked  taliesin sighs /none/ thats again mixed company and public company  sam no you can tell us about the ritual ritual  matt theres a look of recognition  sam yes it was successful remind me what it was again theres been so many rituals lately  taliesin mixed results  liam you were mentioning this group the tomb takers you had another name before were you a  group and our friend joined you at some point  matt well he led us away from the original order they were a bit clouded we had a new path  travis wow  /none/ marisha and what was the name of the original order you were a part of  sam not the tomb takers that was the splinter group right  liam the one that came before  matt theres a few looks now of the euphoria is washing away from the face  taliesin you dont have to tell them anything you dont want to tell them thats all right  ashley was he your new path  matt he brought us onto a new path yes  liam what was your unifying trait or pursuit  taliesin foolishness in thinking i /dung/ knew what i was doing  sam that is not a good answer  taliesin thats the answer youre getting  travis this is all well and good and kind of fucking boring i couldnt help but notice that  surlylooking crew up there who might that be  matt oh these are all members of the gentlemans troupe as am i at which point the  tabaxi cree turns back and looks and you can see in the far back right corner of the chamber  there is a long dark mahogany wellcarved table there you see standing arms /dung/ crossed a very  muscularlooking goliath female with a very short leather strap top shaved sides of the head in a  tuft of a mohawk that curls down into a long ponytail that goes down the back whos glaring in  your direction sitting beside this burlylooking goliath you see a highbacked chair with a red  velvet matte sitting feet crossed up on the table in a nice long deepblue coat leathergloved  hands light teal skin jetblack hair thats long just past the shoulders a widows peak in  the center a bit of a dark goatee /none/ male figure standing there hands entwined and crossed  looking at you from across the way with a curious grin the gentleman  taliesin you work for the gentleman these days  matt we had to find work we didnt know if you were ever coming back we thought so we had to  move on we knew youd eventually return i just did not know how long and we had to make ends meet  taliesin how is it working for the gentleman  matt work is fine you hear a clapping from the gentleman so we have company /none/ strangers in  our midst he rights himself in the chair please come before me present yourselves i  want to know who has graced us with their majestic presence come come the finger goes up and you  watch as everyone holding the rifles cock them and point down at you  sam fjord say something  matt come  taliesin im looking at our friend  matt cree goes  taliesin all right ill saunter over with my drink and sit down at the table come on everyone  lets do this  matt so you all go /none/ and sit theres a long bench there on the opposite side of this table where you  can either stand or sit since theres quite a few of you  ashley ill stand  matt jester is like i dont know whats going on sorry laura i dont know what the fuck  jester would do jester is the most random character  liam shes going homer simpson running circles around  taliesin shes giving out leaflets  liam i will also stand  matt as you guys approach you hear this wheezing laughter theres the second balcony that was /none/  facing in the direction where you entered as you look up you can see theres another rifleman  standing and hanging by one arm off the side you see this crazedlooking young gnome with this big  mound of curly hair and this big chinstrap beard whos just dangling going wheezing laughter  looking over you all from a distance really creepily the ogres there still hand on the  maul so introductions please i think i have an idea who you are but i want to hear it from  your mouths please tell me  travis humbly /none/ we are members of the mighty nein  matt i knew it i knew it laughs oh this is a gracious day very well welcome to the real  evening nip pleasure to have you each and every one of you ive seen you around upstairs  wandering and skulking a bit i didnt know you were part of this mighty troupe  ashley well i hang out with them but i actually like the drinks here a lot so  matt much better down here speaking of which a round please the bartender looking a bit  frightened on /none/ the side starts filling tankards all right so what brings such esteemed  adventurers to my pocket of the underworld  travis well we sought an audience and to be frank we thought we might find a little bit more  of a warm reception than the one that were currently getting  matt oh im sorry they pull the rifles off you habit safety you understand  travis oh of course easily understood  matt so you have my audience  travis we mean to make ourselves of service whether it be for the good of the city or /none/ other  endeavors were new here we thought we would try to make as many introductions and have as many  meetings happen as we could  matt interesting i have one question before we get too deep in this conversation how did you  find your way in here  marisha im a bit of an enthusiast of the underworld so i came across some information  matt go on  marisha demedan got his order of bloodroot it was really good  matt demedan gave you this information  marisha no demedan was clumsy with his information  /tavern/ matt equally dangerous good to know remember that the goliath cracks knuckles all right  so interesting now you know the way in thats dangerous as weve just made acquaintances and  you now know the direct path into my domain so to make this a comfortable conversation and possibly  an arrangement going forward that we can all agree upon i have one small request  travis oh im sure wed be all ears  matt cree please the tabaxi who was in the back goes yes of course steps over to the  side of the bar and /none/ picks up a small leather satchel puts it over her shoulder walks up  behind the table opens it and pulls out an alchemist rack of a bunch of corked vials like  small vials opens it and says i need just and bear with me please just a small bit of  your blood the reasoning being if i cant trust you and you cant trust me how am i to know you  arent going to turn me in immediately outside to the kings hall and i need some means in case you  just abscond with this /town/ information perhaps make an arrangement with me and then leave town i need  to find you  travis oh of course and forgive my ignorance this would be used to locate us is that what this  is for  matt oh that is crees speciality  taliesin it is definitely crees speciality  travis yeah fuck it  matt as you pull your hand out cree does a flick of the finger and you watch as the blood trails  off on its own like a small serpent of mercury and just flowing for a second even though /none/ it was a  small wound its bleeding quite a bit and youre like uh it makes you a little uncomfortable  and then all of a sudden the blood flow stops the vial is filled about an inch full then she caps  it thank you so much  travis how did you do that  matt its a gift that i learned the same place where the nonagons gifts were found  taliesin lucien at the table is fine  matt lucien  travis right  matt next  taliesin i trust you with this dont get fancy /none/  matt same thing fills the next vial a strange almost an arc of crimson finds its way and fills a  secondary tube theres like twelve tubes there but shell fill as many as needed for this one  travis laughs dont like it do you  marisha can i borrow a tusk  travis yeah  matt goes ahead and acquires the blood from you jester goes me too me too feeling left out in  the moment gives her blood as well  sam caleb are we doing this  matt no harm will come to you /none/ unless you bring harm to me so this is just a precautionary  measure i appreciate your trust  travis three to go one two three  matt with that your blood is taken into a vial  sam all right ill follow suit  matt your blood is also taken into a vial  sam hisses  matt easy enough to do spurting  ashley fair enough i take my finger and i run it across my blade as i stare at him  matt the blood is drawn into the vial the final vial is capped cree closes /none/ the satchel places it  on the shoulder and then bows and steps back paying direct attention to the gentleman and then  out of the corner of her eye towards you fantastic i really appreciate that youre  getting a closer look now of the gentleman the teal skin tone its interesting it looks almost  like hes perpetually sweating theres moisture on the outskirts of his skin at all times theres  the faint hint of whether it be condensation from the air around or produced internally theres a  general sense of dampness to the skin of /none/ this figure so an arrangement you say first off  just because its fun for me are you believers in luck  taliesin not anymore  travis yes id say i am  matt that destiny is looking out for you ive seen enough in my time and have lived in spite of  it all because something wants me here would you consider yourselves lucky  travis sam and taliesin yes  matt good then lets gamble  marisha then what  matt then lets gamble  marisha oh laughs  travis are you writing that down  sam /none/ lets gamble  matt i want to know how lucky my investments are gambit of ord who wishes to face me in this  who feels the luckiest of your band  travis shit wheres the fucking luck of jester  marisha i know shes at home  sam i watched her play last time i could do i dont stutters  travis i could as well  sam why dont you do it ill just drink i need just a little loosener  travis all right i feel lucky  matt all right great one pass 50 gold buyin /dung/ if i win youre mine if you win then we can do business  travis deal  matt all right he goes and pulls beneath the table a satchel of gold pulls out a handful of  gold and plops it on the table you watch on the side as the creepy gnomish figure that was hanging  from the balcony earlier leaps down creepy chuckling comes up and he pulls out a set of  cards and is shuffling them in his hand as he steps around the side hes now flanking the right  side of the gentleman /none/ so you have the large goliath on one side the small creepy gnome on  the other shuffling the cards hands the deck to the gentleman does one final cut sets it down  so whats your name  travis fjord  matt fjord let us deal did you put 50 gold on the table  travis no now i do  taliesin there was nothing fishy in the card shuffle in the cut was there  matt make an insight check  travis ooh get em  taliesin lets do it 12  matt seemed to be above board /none/  marisha im going to keep an eye on the deal as well  matt okay the first cards are dealt out for the first round this is gambit of ord this is  different from the crickqueens call this is a marquesian card game roll a d8 but keep it  hidden to yourself all right so now im going to go ahead and raise another 50 gold clinking  onto the table  travis my goodness this is getting expensive quite fast  matt well we deal with quite a large amount of business  travis yawning 50 /none/ gold  matt so you put another 50 gold  travis mmhmm  matt all right go ahead and roll a d6 and keep that secret alongside that die do you wish to raise  travis you first  matt i raised first last time im offering you the chance to raise if youd like  travis funny how that works no im good where i am  matt interesting ill raise another 50 gold  sam oh god  travis sounds good 50 it is  matt go ahead and roll a d4 hes holding his cards in his /none/ hand looks across at you looks all  throughout the room well fjord looks like its time to call  travis what were not going to bet again  silence  matt puts another 100 gold on the table  travis lets make it 150  matt laughs very well  travis mutters thats all the money i have  sam have we seen anything suspicious from the deals or the  liam as jester jester wants you to know that from home she is watching the gentleman and making  sure he is not cheating  matt make an /none/ insight check for jester and you make an insight check as well since you were both  keeping a close eye on that  liam oh she rolled really well whats her modifier added to an 18  sam plus four  liam oh 22  matt 22 actually there has been no weirdness with the cards this is a straight test of luck  liam as jester oh this man has the luck feat  matt yeah you dont see anything nothing that catches you off  marisha yeah i rolled less than jester  matt so were now /none/ at a pot of 150 times two 50 times two so 600 gold i believe right 50 50  50 and the 150  travis counting so 500  sam did you start with 50 though  matt we started with 50 and then we raised 50 and then raised 50 so that was 150 so its 600  on the table  travis i can do math  matt 300 from each of them all right he presents the dice that he had rolled or the cards  that he had found which is a five a four and /none/ a one a grand total of ten  marisha oh my god come on fjord  travis a seven a five and a three  cheering  marisha oh my god  sam thats the first thing weve ever won  laughter  matt as soon as you reveal the cards theres a gasp a gasp in the room and the gentleman his  muscles tense for a second and he goes laughs wellplayed and well earned take the coin its yours  travis thank you nice hand  matt good to know that we have luck on your side /none/ as well thats very important to me with people i  do business with so clears throat you have some balls throwing down that change and going into a  game with me i like that so what can our many gifts and my associates present to you what are  your strengths what are your skills ive heard youve done some deeds ive heard you killed some  terrible creature in the sewers is that correct  sam we did yes we fought and killed a giant spider of sorts  matt right which helped tremendously because we use /none/ the sewers quite often that had become an  issue with some of our transference in the subterranean sewers of the city and  unfortunately the underworks themselves have been a bit clogged as of late so thank you for that  and one of our compatriots and he points up to one of the balconies on the side and you can see  behind the individual that had the rifle you see kara the halfelf  marisha oh i was going to ask for her  matt whos stepping forward ever so slightly and says one of our compatriots /none/ has kept us up  to speed about your infiltrations i have to say im impressed  liam ja then you probably know we are not the best youre going to find but we are up and comers  matt not too bad  travis very versatile id have to say though balanced  liam good skill set  taliesin high profile but low profile  matt well we are a company that specializes in the completion of the tasks and trading of things  perhaps not the most legal things that are restricted by the empire that means our /none/ skills  are best through speed subterfuge darkness we dont have the best aside for muscle besides  from well laughs i do keep sorah by my side just in case  sam is that the goliath  matt that is the goliath he refers to  sam sorad  matt sorah  liam singing que sorah sorah  marisha wait the goliath or the ogre  matt and travis the goliath  marisha the  liam the mohawk lady  marisha okay  sam were very strong  matt very good  sam as you can see yasha is /none/ very strong  matt well youve caused enough chaos in the trispire you brought down one of the more  corrupt though strangely uncorruptible from our end politicians weve seen and from what i hear  lord sutan is already in chains chuckles  sam quickly we dont know anything about that we had nothing to do with it  travis nott i think  taliesin shes quick to toe the party line  travis yeah  matt thats fine well see how long sutan stays in there he has his ways depending on how strong  a case youve /none/ left behind and a little finagling on our end if our partnership grows mutually  beneficial perhaps we could push that over the edge for him and keep him away for quite some  time now apparently ive also heard theyre still seeking the murderers of the highrichter  particularly a purpleskinned tiefling who was spotted not far from the home that night with  rather ostentatious clothing as well as a wandering darkskinned youth a woman with  physical capability so that doesnt bode well for you does it  marisha sucks being in the wrong place at the /none/ wrong time  matt well as seeing as how were friends now i can say that i could probably make this  investigation go away  marisha is this an investigation that you caused to begin with  matt laughs no this is an investigation that you caused  marisha doing your bidding  matt no  marisha through one of your associates  matt my associate was making sure that the events would transpire in our favor but  nevertheless we were not the orchestrators of the knights of requital  liam lets assume this is not a gift /none/ you are offering what is it that you are looking for in return  matt oh well many gifts come once weve established a partnership we become friends now  and i like friendship thats great thats fine but i deal in trade mostly so i would like a  favor in kind he leans forwards a bit and you can see some of the condensation slowly dripping  down the side of the face making a few spots on the table  sam ill offer him a napkin  matt as you hold a napkin out the eyes catch /none/ you for a second the head turns confused for a second  taliesin just  laughter  taliesin great thought not now good thought  sam he seems like he needs  taliesin shushing  sam hes schvitzing i mean its not even humid in here whispering hes got a problem  matt about a mile out of the underworks beneath the city down the underground river pass that our  shipments to the ounterloch and berleben pass through one of my men noticed a strange wall  uncovered by time we sent a team of our best infiltrators to /none/ see what this was about within a  purple light and the promise of ancient spoils seemed to peek from within some sort of abandoned  research facility from ages past well my curiosity got the better of me so we sent the  team inward to seek it out but amongst these few goldladen objects that enticed my men they are  a superstitious lot and upon being beset by series of phantom globes they fled and collapsed  the entrance behind them you see him glare past you and hear the shifting of a few pieces of armor /none/  as three individuals avert their gaze sighs so those fucks have failed i would like you to  return to that site for me find a way in inquire within seek and seeing as how you are so good at  eliminating monstrous beasts clearing the space of any dangers hostile creatures return with any  of your findings do this for me and i will see that the scent is thrown off you permanently ill  even let you keep some of the spoils  travis this is most intriguing i hope we would be able to interview /none/ your previous compatriots  wed like to know what they saw before what we might expect  matt of course by all means do we have a deal  travis to clear our name here in zadash  sam how do we know that you can clear our name weve proven to you that were lucky you know our  reputation we dont know anything about you  matt lets say ive lived and worked a solid 15 years orchestrating the seedy underbelly of this  entire city ive never been caught ive never been arrested and i thrive on /none/ a pile of gold and  riches you can only begin to imagine  taliesin im beginning to imagine it right now actually  matt good  taliesin thats very nice  liam insight check  matt make an insight check  marisha i bet he edubates on that pile of gold  laughter  taliesin that is certainly one to grow on  liam not good enough thats a twelve  matt i mean hes a shifty individual being by nature but its hard to get a sense of whether or  not he would be trying to lie /none/  liam yeah hes sweating he must be nervous  sam if i may we passed a test for you would you pass one for us  matt laughs little one laughs you intrigue me young greenskin so overtly walking amongst  the nobles above and yet youve kept your throat that says a lot about you yes please tell me  what would this trial be you would ask of the gentleman  sam may i have three of those vials just the empty ones  matt cree fumbles in the pouch and brings out three of the empty /none/ glass vials and hands them  over to you  sam if i were to fill two of these vials with ordinary alcohol and one with something else  would you be able to tell which is which with your discerning eye and your years of experience  matt hmm certainly i feel confident  marisha take the pepsi challenge  sam ill take out my shitty flask as my good one is gone fill two vials with alcohol and then take  out my vial of acid and pour it into the third are they reasonably the same colorish /none/  matt reasonably id say the alcohol is a bit more brackish the acid itself is a little more  translucent but you could possibly add a little bit of alcohol to it  sam all right ill take a little splash of alcohol and some darker stuff and mix it around  matt youre an alchemist youve dealt with varying chemicals so id say given a moment you  could go ahead and match it fairly close sure  sam all right this one is the acid these two are booze and now i will try to rapid movement /none/  taliesin doesnt actually switch hands you just do this a lot  liam never mess with a goblin when death is on the line  matt make a sleight of hand check versus his perception  travis youre going to kill the gentleman  sam 15  matt 15 total  sam yes  matt all right you present the vials  sam if you die im sorry  matt chuckles this one is alcohol this one is alcohol this one is acid and takes the acid  from your grasp and uncorks it and drinks it  sam /none/ ooh shit thats baller  matt so roll the damage for your acid  marisha some inigo montoya shit  sam i dont know what to roll its 1d6 or something what do i i got to look  matt it should be on your break down of your  sam its here acid vial  ashley hes awesome  matt i have it here actually  sam 2d6  matt so yeah roll 2d6  taliesin that is so baller oh my god  sam 11  matt 11 all right so he slight cough grunts downs it but /none/ it doesnt seem to have as  much of an effect on him it looks like it hurt and he takes it the muscles tense a bit the face  twitches as it goes down and it burns but then he takes the vial and corks it again rolls it across  the table coughs does that satisfy your inquiry  sam gulp gulp yep yeah thats good that was impressive i mean you pass the test sir  matt chuckles good good i like it  taliesin i will say the only thing that i can think of that /tavern/ i would want not even necessarily  addend to this contract if we are going to do this to you im looking to stay on the down low  in general if we can agree even my presence in this city necessarily is as far as its  concerned is none of anybodys concern outside this bar i would be forever grateful  matt we deal well in secrecy my friend  taliesin i figured you would  matt lucien was it  taliesin sometimes  matt chuckles very well  travis sir i couldnt help but hear that this /none/ is about a mile outside of the city is that correct  matt correct  travis are you operating on any sort of a timeline might we have a little bit of lenience  with how quickly we get this dealt with  matt the sooner the better because we can begin opening that line weve now two weeks and three  shipments lost  travis ive just had a thought actually if you could help us at the same time were trying to  get a friend of ours out of the city and coughs recent events seem to /none/ have clogged up most entries  and exits we have a friend horris that needs to find his way to a safe spot  marisha kara knows him real well  matt right this would be dolans partner yes  travis indeed  matt hmm  travis discretion is appreciated  matt we specialize in discretion and specialize in smuggling and specialize in people  travis figured you might  matt so you do this deed well consider it part of your gift  travis outstanding i think we have a deal do we not  marisha yeah  liam /none/ i find all of this very agreeable  matt good very good quiet one now we have access to the tunnels of course well have to  blindfold you to bring you through the underworks to the tunnel that leads to this underground  river when you decide to leave just because theres a lot of secrets down here and were  still building our trust but come back in whenever youre ready well be happy to escort  you and send you on your way  travis outstanding  ashley how long do you keep our blood for  /none/ matt oh as long as we have our arrangements  ashley but we get it back when were done or we decide not to work with you anymore  matt if youve proven yourself trustworthy enough in the long term perhaps but understand  that this is just a precaution whos to know perhaps things go sour in a few months i want to  make sure you dont double cross me and send the guard down  marisha does it look like hes speaking from experience hes a little twitchy  matt make an insight check  marisha grumbling /tavern/ 14  matt its more that hes lived this long by being careful and when a bunch of strangers find this  secret pass into his lair he wants to be damn well sure that he knows where to find you if need be  ashley okay  travis and ashley fair enough  taliesin remember the name lucien doesnt leave this bar outside i never want to hear it uttered  matt i dont know who any of you are outside this bar  taliesin brilliant  matt dont worry anyway and he throws his feet back up on /none/ the table  drinks are on me  until you make your leave  travis fantastic nott pace yourself now you hear  sam growling nervous humming  taliesin quality not quantity  travis is that goliath wielding any sort of visible weapon  matt at the moment it does not appear theres a weapon immediately on the goliath but as you look  behind in the corner right behind the chair where the gentleman sits there looks to be one  heftyass maul a giant chunk of solid metal with a long handle on it that is resting against /tavern/ the stone  travis ogre and the goliath mauls each fuck  matt they like to break things  marisha who were the two guys that said that they passed out trying to get away from the creepy  ancient facility  travis oh yeah they were armored behind us  matt yeah theres three guys theres the bar in the chamber next to that to the right of the  actual bar theres a doorway that opens up into a storeroom its underneath the top balcony  underneath the balcony right next to where the ogre is posting watch /tavern/ in the center of the tavern  the three of them are sitting off to the side looking uncomfortable they were sitting earlier  and since all of this happened they stood to attention and havent found a comfortable moment  to sit down  marisha just shifty roguey underbelly types  matt yeah you look over and you see two of them appear to be human relatively young probably mid  to late 20s scruffylooking one of them has a darker froy hair thats unkempt and covering  part of his face the other one has very short cut /dung/ hair dark complexion brown red theyre  both wearing darker leathers and cloaks that are thrown over one shoulder theyre holding tankards  in their hand and theyre both talking amongst each other while keeping an eye on you  travis that group looks like your type feel like making friends  marisha my favorite pastime  matt the third one appears to be a halfling female who is sitting in a corner quietly  sipping out of the tankard and looking nervously around  marisha want to accompany me  travis i would love to  marisha lets go /none/  matt just the two of you approaching  marisha sure anyone else wants to join  taliesin im taking a long look at cree and i want to see if i see any of the things that i  expect to see  travis what do you expect to see there t  sam you know dander  taliesin i want to see if theres any markings or anything otherwise that i would expect to see  matt oh make a perception check  taliesin all right  sam why are you locking your ipad between every move  /none/ taliesin because its better that way perception check wow thats a terrible roll thats a five  matt a furcovered tabaxi its hard to make any details out beyond the fur unfortunately  taliesin all right thats fair  matt the two of you approach the corner kara is watching you as you step past and steps back on  the balcony out of sight  marisha i give her a little clicks tongue  when i walk by  matt she goes  marisha deal with that later  travis yeah i was going to say the same thing /dung/  matt as you approach the two gentlemen and the female halfling they just watch you they dont  engage you verbally at all they just keep an eye  marisha i grab one of the halfdrinken beers from someone elses table and set it down and be like  here you go i got this for you  liam that was mine  laughter  matt he takes it the guy with the larger curly hair takes it and pours it into his own and sets  it back down thank you  marisha heard you guys got all /none/ heebie jeebie and passed out in your last little mission  matt well and the other guy elbows him and hes like whispering shut up  marisha no thats cool were here to clean up yalls shit  matt look we signed up for this to make quick money were good at moving quickly were good at  seeing whats worthwhile were good at picking things out were not good at dealing with spooky  fucking undead ghost things okay we went in we went through this path we found a crack in the  wall we kicked it down /none/ we went inside there was a staircase went up and down went downstairs it  seemed empty it was confusing we didnt see anything of interest went upstairs the  staircase the little spiral staircase and there was a much larger chamber we started  looking around for anything worthwhile it looked like it got picked clean long ago dust  everywhere the more we began to look there was this cold temperature in the room and eventually  these little lights began to come out of the wall at first we were curious by them one of them got /none/  really close to therad over there he suddenly shocked in a serious jolt and you see him on the  back looking a bit spooked recalling the story he goes we knew then these whatever the fuck these  things were they werent friends of ours so we got our shit and we ran we had a small explosive so  we threw it behind us to collapse the wall hoping that at least it would slow them down we  realized in hindsight that it was pretty stupid because if they were spectral enough to come out  /none/ of the walls they still could have followed us we got up the river from there we got our boats  and made our way back  travis let me get this straight a bunch of fucking floating lights came out of the wall gave  your boy a little static shock and you ran  matt they both look at each other and look at the halfling the halflings like i wasnt going to  stay behind  travis yeah well theyre calling in the big leaguers now so well take it from here your way  up and /none/ down those stairs you mentioned you get tripped up along the way or was it just easy sailing  marisha any traps  matt we didnt go into the bottom chamber that looked ominous enough we stuck to the top one  marisha what  travis what about it was ominous  matt its just a big octagonal dome chamber had this faint purpleish glow on the inside   marisha are you afraid of geometry i dont  travis yeah scared of school  marisha yeah sure  travis yeah old terrors  matt look you can come by /none/ and sass me all you fucking want ive been here for two years you  newcomers walk in here and think youre all tough shit you think its so great go go in there  come back  sam trying to throw it in the garbage but it hit your balloon  marisha i saw the whole  liam still a game  matt you think youre tough shit you go take care of it  travis i appreciate your passion i dont think youre in great favor in this room at the moment  you see that really tall /none/ woman over there with that big greatsword on her back she doesnt  appreciate when people talk to us like that  matt make an intimidation check  ashley do i see him point at me  liam flex  travis 13  matt 13  travis no 15 sorry  matt 15 hes looking over at you you can see him swallowing hard  ashley i put my hand on my hilt and i pull it out a little bit  matt hey no i understand that thats great looks like you guys are much more wellequipped  for /none/ this shit than we are look im not saying were better than you were better at some  things youre better at others thats why theyre sending you in because we cant fight  fucking ghosts you go for it  marisha were just giving you a hard time man its fun the whole time this was happening i was  rubbing my feet against the ground building up a static shock  matt its stone but sure  laughter  marisha okay rubbing against fjord like this  travis my shag armor  marisha just waiting for it all /none/ right thank you so much man  matt all right  marisha all right good laughter sorry cant help it  travis did you three have a name  liam the mighty drei  travis dont be ashamed if you dont  matt

the others  taliesin yasha do i deal with this or do i not deal /tavern/ with this  ashley i think you should deal with this  taliesin i dont want to deal with this  ashley does any of this sound familiar to you from the past  taliesin i hate this im going to stand up and walk over to cree  matt okay cree is still standing by the bar with the satchel on as you stand up and start  approaching she smiles  taliesin a lifetime ago  matt indeed i can tell you its so good to see you  taliesin i have a weird question and i apologize /none/ for it the spell i used to get away it i  wasnt there for as long as you thought i was i missed how everything ended in the end i hate to  ask but i was long gone before anything really started to go down how did everything end can  you just ill explain why in a moment  matt well you had acquired the tome with the ritual spell that you required to attempt to reach  the city that lady i dont remember her name the spell slinger from the capital she came and  /none/ oversaw and performed the ritual for you i dont trust those folk but i trust you and if you  trusted than that was enough for me you gave us a speech we had a fine meal we all got ready  there in the forest  taliesin thats where i lost you then  matt she said it would be hard for us to tell whether or not it worked at first but we went and  checked and you were not breathing for a good hour you were not breathing and you had gone  cold we knew /none/ then that that we had lost you we checked and im very attuned to vitals as you  know there was no heartbeat so we waited longer the sun rose and nothing so as you told us if  anything were to go wrong we had to get rid of any sign any trace so not far from the tomb  taker hideout we buried you and we went our separate ways she took the tome the mage woman  it was part of the arrangement you had with her  taliesin im going to have to find her again /none/ at some point the reason ive stayed quiet it was  never going to work somebody was working against me i dont know who but i cant trust anyone i  saw how you reacted to seeing me and it was im willing to believe it wasnt you who turned but  it could have been her but it could have been one of us thats why i need you to keep it quiet please  matt make a deception check youre starting to get in deep into this now  travis deception check  taliesin 13  sam can /none/ i wander over and see if i can overhear anything  matt make a perception check  sam 12  matt you start wandering over but theres too much noise and general din in the chamber around  you to make anything out  taliesin there will come a moment when i can tell you everything but its so complicated please  just keep it quiet for now  matt of course  taliesin until i know that everyones going to react the way that you did to seeing me  matt right of course lucien  taliesin i will /none/ tell you everything eventually  matt please please do  taliesin i give a hug  matt theres a moment pause and then cree takes in the hug too  taliesin its been too long  matt theres a faint purr in the ear and then you hear the voice whisper its good to see you  taliesin im sorry for everything and i give the pat and head back to the table  matt me too as you walk away  liam while that conversation happens can i speak to you just for a second  travis of course /none/  liam that was a princely sum you just wagered with there  travis yeah good thing i won huh  liam yes it is that wouldnt have by any chance have been recompense for everything we did  the other night or are you rolling in it

why do you need to know so many things  travis youre not afraid of inclement weather or anything are you itd been real fair that  storm rolled in and poof you were fucking gone  sam she left us before we were ambushed in alfield and when she left us this time we almost  died in this plot to overthrow the empire or whatever it was with crick soldiers maybe its  related  ashley pretty shit luck for you then /none/ that has nothing to do with me  marisha i respect a woman who can handle her business on her own personal time  ashley thank you very much beau thank you sometimes i need to leave plus

use a hand for a bit  ashley well see  taliesin id owe you one  /none/ travis did you handle what you needed to handle  ashley i think i did i think im looking for answers for something and i dont know if i  received any more but im still looking  sam if you told us what it was we could help you  ashley i dont know if you can  liam no pressure at all but it is nice to have some muscle around  sam lots of pressure maximum amount of pressure  ashley thank you nott ill stick around and offer my strength as much as i can  /none/ liam she is just joshing you  sam i am not  taliesin she is definitely not joshing  travis i make sure notts drink is full all the time  laughter  travis can i look around this unsavory place there are no faces that i recognize right  matt glancing around no other than kara who you had spoken with previously nobody else  catches your attention  marisha what is she doing right now she still watching us  matt no shes not watching you shes receded into the top balcony into a chamber behind  sam /none/ it seemed like the gentleman whos very impressive by the way knows a lot about stuff  including the fact that we were involved in a plot to frame the sutan fellow  marisha he knows kara pretty well  sam do you think he would know if the xhorhas invasion at the same time as our little plan was a  bigger conspiracy were we set up  taliesin why would we be set up  sam i dont know but it seems coinkydinky that we were there on a night when towers were  exploding  marisha i /none/ think we should talk to kara ive been playing hard to get waiting to see if she mingles  around to us  sam youre so coy  travis i think karas the way to go we start asking him questions about something that big  maybe he wont like us poking our nose around  taliesin well check but shit happens and youve got to be doing something when shit  happens we just happened to be doing something  travis when shit happened  taliesin its hardly a coincidence  ashley you guys are going to xhorhas  /town/ travis no there was a bit of a beatdown the other night in the trispire one of the towers  was attacked  marisha oh yeah when did you get in town  ashley i saw that  travis and marisha you were here  ashley i was here ive been here the whole time  marisha what were you up to  ashley i was trying to figure some shit out  sam what was it  taliesin what we commonly referred to in the circus as yashaing  travis oh yashaing  ashley i like to get away /none/ from things sometimes  liam we have been getting our hands dirty a little bit are you sure you want to get your  hands dirty with us  ashley thats all id like to do  liam thats direct  taliesin its a sight to behold  travis you want to go talk to kara before we get out of here  ashley wait what was the xhorhas bit  sam oh xhorhas assassins tried to steal a box of some sort that was a weapon of mass destruction or  a portal to another dimension or some sort /tavern/ of fount of energy that powers their race we have no  idea but they stole it we encountered them in the sewers we did not kill the xhorhas assassin  but he was killed shortly thereafter and we stole his magical dodecahedron  taliesin you said that in this bar  liam as jester technically we stole it from the crownsguard because he took it away so we stole  it later  taliesin lets not say anything in here that we wouldnt want to be circulated  sam all you need to know is the people from xhorhas /none/ are dead now do you know people from  xhorhas  ashley im from xhorhas  marisha what  sam who are you  taliesin wait is that a beer  sam yes  ashley probably not where they were from  sam youre a cr can i say crick is that okay do i have to be a crick to say it  taliesin shes not a crick  liam depends on who youre talking to  ashley i dont think im where theyre from im more southern parts of xhorhas  sam youre from that part of the /none/ world  ashley no i dont know exactly where they were from i dont know who they are i dont know  anything about them  travis they came in trying to steal this beacon this glowing beacon which we still have but they  were mighty upset about it  ashley okay  liam how long have you been in the empire  ashley make sure thats correct actually  matt that is correct  sam you dont know if you were born there or grew up there  ashley yes  liam how long have you been here /none/ in the empire  ashley for about i dont know when did i meet you  taliesin god was it a year and a half ago  ashley year and a half  taliesin give or take how many people are listening in on this clearly right now  matt make a perception check  marisha im doing a scan see if theres any wandering eyes  taliesin 14 actually no 17 sorry  matt 17 as is the nature of a seedy underbelly there are a lot of individuals who are very  interested in the newcomers that waltzed /none/ in made a deal with their boss and have sat and had a  drink and are talking all sorts of business there are a number of folks that are slowly creeping in  taliesin can we please stop talking in here  liam what do you mean people are listening to heavy metal gwar babe purple guy and little  green girl in a doll mask  taliesin they are serving us free drinks of course theyre listening to everything we say  lets retire for the evening  sam dont we need to talk to kara  taliesin /tavern/ we can come back and do this tomorrow  sam no shes right here today  taliesin you talk to kara then but no more whatever this is  travis why lucien you afraid the myriad will hear whats his reaction  marisha he definitely had a thing  taliesin i am genuinely a little drunk and didnt remember who the myriad were  travis do i believe him  matt make an insight check  travis shit 11  taliesin what am i doing deception ten so i have to tell the truth i have no idea id  /tavern/ literally forgotten because im a little drunk and im really preoccupied right now  matt you dont have to roll deception if youre not lying  taliesin i know i was just doing it to fuck with them  liam im going to have frumpkin jump into notts lap and do the gnawing on her fingers to keep  her occupied  sam ah ill eat you  taliesin angry meowing  marisha we go talk to kara  sam do you know lucien too  matt you go through a door and there is a switchback stairway that leads /none/ to the upper  balcony area and as you head up there it looks like theres a weapon rack which has a bunch of  weapons set up karas currently sitting on the edge of a bench and is sharpening the blades  small daggers and stuff and looks back oh hello sets it aside look im sorry i didnt  mean to deceive anyone but thats my business  marisha so you were deceiving us  matt i was keeping some things close to my chest like im sure you do  travis whats that saying be careful of /none/ the toes you step on they might belong to the ass you got  to kiss later  marisha thats a good one have to remember that one  matt look i deceived no one outside of what you needed to know we got our business done ive  done nothing wrong  marisha how much of this was orchestrated from the beginning were we a distraction for the  bigger picture  matt what do you mean  travis the attack on the tower  matt oh the crick attack on the tower no had nothing to do with /none/ us were not going to work  with those savage beasts  marisha insight check  matt go for it  travis i was looking at you  marisha 21  cheering  marisha bring it to me  travis still need a whisper corner  liam singing ashley ashleys back ashleys back in the game shes back in the game and shes  never going back and blindspot is no more well maybe it is were just not sure were waiting to  find out  ashley singing were waiting to find out but ill be here for a /none/ minute now back to the game  matt that wasnt planned by anyone if anything it might have saved our asses because it made  what you did small potatoes by comparison im thankful it happened but look those things  continue to attack us from the eastern border and from what little informations coming through  its getting worse with each passing week so the last thing i want to do is let any more of them  into our backyard  marisha all right you wont want to frame them in any type of larger scheme considering it /none/ seems  like youre quite irritated with them  matt look i know my limits im not some mastermind i want to make some coin i want to  work with one of my skill sets make the boss happy i stay mainly within the city i dont want  to deal with any bigger stuff than that im just a girl  travis im going to ask you a question youre  probably not going to give me the truth to is your  relationship with the gentleman one of a debt or one of convenience  matt its /none/ one of convenience keeping it short for you it sure beats pickpocketing in the  streets and being beaten when im caught  travis i hear that  marisha interesting how long have you been working for the gentleman  matt about eight years  marisha thats a long time  matt i worked my way up  marisha does he feel the same about the xhorhasian as you do  matt as far as i know yeah its not good for business  marisha you know its not as difficult to rally a society of people against another its /none/ not too  hard to start a war if you really want to  matt thats true but i dont know his whole plan per se but business works well when things  are predictable right and when theres war involved things get real unpredictable emotions  are high the amount of armed guard and military gets high were forced to skulk in the shadows  until it blows over last thing we want is for all this to get any crazier then  travis i only have one other thing i was taken by dolans passionate message  matt /none/ dolans a good man hes not caught up in all this dont try and mix us up in that right  he doesnt deserve it  travis all right is some of the business that we can expect going to go against the fair people of  this city  matt generally no most of the folks that work with the gentleman and that we work for are  wellpaying because theyre welloff some of them arent the most moral either we dont do  anything that hurts the folk that dont deserve it at least from what i know /none/ we dont kill we  dont murder we just move and sell and deal in various goods that arent perfectly legal  marisha did ulog and dolan know about your involvement with the gentleman  matt no  marisha all right heres my question ulog was in against the highrichter that was his  motivation dolan wanted to get after lord sutan for running him out of his practice  matt right  marisha what did you get out of all this  matt well if i have a friend that makes it high in the political chain of the /none/ city dolan and i  have the ear of the gentleman thats a mighty powerful ally to the underworld without that ally  knowing  travis indeed thats a connection worth the trouble  marisha youre only in it to be a middleman no goals or aspirations yourself  matt well theres good money in being the middleman if this works out to be honest it  sure beats having to shuffle in the shadows i work better in public anyway its what i do for  the gentleman now  marisha yeah you got a nice face its good /none/ for presentory purposes  travis you got a nice face  marisha she does look shes got a good face  travis im glad you found a place here it was good to see you again  matt you too sorry  marisha that was a compliment did it not  travis if i cant tell you didnt  marisha that was a compliment all right guess well see you around  matt stay safe you know where to find me or at least ask about me now looks like were in bed  one way or the other  /none/ marisha i mean  travis leave that one alone  marisha all right lets go  travis we head downstairs  matt all right you join up with the rest of the crew you guys have all gathered again what would  you like to do  taliesin situationally it could be a thing  sam i think theyre talking about the sword  taliesin yeah weve been talking about the sword  travis oh yeah the one that we had for  taliesin yeah  sam jester has it doesnt she  taliesin and travis yeah  sam jester /none/ by the way you seriously your farts have been disgusting tonight ive been  sitting next to you all night  and its just foul foul  travis yeah like sprinkles and hard candies just dry puffing  matt thats not me that is just a gift from the traveler  travis farting her skirts like farting  matt this is why you dont miss a game laura  ashley but shes sick  travis singing im on the couch tonight  laughter  liam jester why are you smearing feces all over your face  travis its wafting over /dung/  matt anyway  travis lucien  sam we can pass out the sword later but do you think its something you could use  matt it a dark graphitecolored blade thats hooked in places and this gradual sharp its a  longsword so its not the beefy thing youre used to  ashley okay  sam what does she wield usually  travis greatsword  ashley moontouched  matt it is a hefty blade what youre used to this ones a little smaller its still helpful  but its your call  ashley i really saved up for the /none/ sword that i have i thank you guys for thinking of me but  sam could you have it as a backup weapon or something  liam yeah you could shoulder that motherfucker  sam could you dual wield  matt i think you could use it with your hexblade you can use it twohanded do a d10 but thats up  to you its not as hefty or as sentimental as the one you have  ashley ill hold on to it  taliesin well hold on well see if you want to play around with it fjord  /none/ liam nott maybe you could use it you know for laughs  sam sure  matt its taller than nott  ashley its taller than nott  taliesin yeah many things are taller than nott  sam i could use it as a makeshift shelter  liam you could do the pole vault  taliesin interesting stuff there  ashley what do you think fjord  travis yeah i think its got some potential do you mind if i hold on to it for a bit  ashley no by all means i think im a bit attached to my /none/ sword  sam can i just clock the tabaxi and see where that satchel with our blood in it is did she  happen to put it down while she was over  matt no it is over her shoulder and by her side  liam thats a shame  ashley thats a shame because i wanted to get it back  travis nott why dont you ask that big ogre by the door what her name is  sam why why would i do that  travis you have such a way with people  sam i do not /none/  travis yeah you knock down the barriers you get right

storytelling and in their writing we do  this after school tutoring we do night time tutoring and we do workshops we also do a field  trip program and then we also go into schools all across los

mart san francisco has a pirate store new york has a superhero supply store they  sell robot supplies /none/ in michigan  marisha laughs that all feeds right back into the organization yeah  joel yeah all the profit from those sales help pay for the free services we provide to kids from  six to 18 years of age  marisha how did that even come about how did you guys think to do that its so brilliant  joel dave eggers one of the founders of the organization he was working with some volunteers  at our founding site in san francisco and when they were taking apart the place somebody said it  looked like the /none/ inside of a pirate ship so they decided to build a pirate store in the front it  was a joke at first but people started leaving money at the counter they didnt even have a  person who would take money people kept donating and leaving money so it became a concept and all  the cities now have storefronts  marisha now if people want to get involved in 826la or any of the 826s across the country how  is the best way to go about doing that  joel well you can go to our website /none/ 826laorg and theres a whole section for volunteers where  you could learn about what it takes to volunteer and you can sign up for volunteer orientation all of  our chapters across the nation have their own sites so folks can visit and get involved  marisha awesome you dont necessarily have to tutor if thats not your jam you can do many  things right  joel yeah we dont turn any volunteers away we try to figure out ways to get all volunteers  involved we need help with design we need help with copy editing we /none/ have a ton of projects that  we could always use help on  marisha amazing all skill sets are appreciated  joel absolutely  marisha joel thank you as always for taking the

fine idea  marisha you know thats safe we should also probably check in on the dodecadoohickey as well  taliesin thats a fair point  travis oh /town/ right does jester have that  matt jester has it

confused by it  taliesin all right thats not entirely true its a vague memory i dont really remember it  its kind of all jumbled its what ive been told about some of it  marisha so is that ritual she was rambling about  taliesin i dont know  travis so before you woke up in the dirt nothing  taliesin there is no before whatever happened before is not me its not part of anything  sighs  sam like your life reset somehow or you just /none/ dont remember  taliesin some asshole got buried in the dirt fuck him i am enjoying what im doing i want  nothing to do with that anything that came before i was happy to just leave it be  liam yeah but do you have any theories for what happened before  taliesin no  marisha did you look the same or did you come back  taliesin how would i know  sam

your childhood  liam yeah many  travis sure  taliesin it felt like that its all bright and more meaningful than it should be there was just  nothing i was practically catatonic i was barely speaking  marisha did you wake /none/ up to people or alone  taliesin alone  liam are you a good guy  taliesin id like to think so  travis why did she seem like she looked up to you so much  taliesin i dont know i dont know who that was ive never heard the name lucien before or that  other name ive never heard of any of it  ashley i didnt realize you didnt you did a good job at pretending  taliesin yeah well i like pretending pretendings great  who cares where anybody came from  marisha how do /none/ you know she actually thinks its you and not you know maybe she just mistook you  for someone actually named lucien  taliesin thats possible except of course she had weird blood powers  marisha so this happens to you  taliesin few months after i came to i started noticing i could do things knew things that i  didnt necessarily know i knew  liam are you talking about your abilities  taliesin yeah i can can i see that dagger  sam i have three of them  taliesin pick one  sam dink  taliesin /none/ ice  matt you watch as this large cluster of moisture all of a sudden solidifies around the outside of  the blade and the blade is now encrusted in jagged ice shards that just stick out the steam  coming off of it mist  sam thats amazing i would ask about how you discovered that because that would not be  something that i would ever just do just to just see but well leave that for another day  taliesin oh no i can were here this is happening thats fine  sam question go back two /none/ beats you said who cares about what happened before  taliesin yeah  sam do you really not want to know your past answer truthfully  taliesin i really dont whoever that was came to that end and i want nothing to do with that  whatever it was it doesnt feel good when i the moment when something creeps through i dont like  it i dont want anything to do with it i was happy i liked the circus the circus was great  liam as jester oh i have a question is there anyone in the group /none/ you find super attractive  as liam a text from laura  taliesin yes  matt i think she was asking yasha  liam oh ask yasha oh  ashley too late  liam as jester what about you  matt as the nature of the spell you know you are under the effect of it and you can be dodgy if  you need to but its up to you  liam as jester you can tell me  taliesin thats a good laura  ashley i feel like its a very good laura yes of course there are /none/ people here that i think are very  attractive and charming but that doesnt mean i will act on that  taliesin you can be monosyllabic if you like with these people  travis molly  taliesin mmhmm  travis in the years that have gone by  sam yasha has a crush on me  travis has anyone called you any other names besides molly lucien or  sam nonagon  travis yeah mahna mahna

come up and give you a name  ashley this was the first time thats happened  taliesin a lot of this was in the hopes that maybe it would never happen keep moving keep quiet  travis you dont know anything about the ritual she was talking about  taliesin but ill say this and im going to put the knife down is there anything sharp around  anything at all  travis in this group  matt yeah plenty of things that are /none/ sharp  taliesin something thats even ridiculous like something not normal  matt yeah i mean there are jagged parts of the wooden frame of the bed  taliesin perfect im just going to cut myself again on the wooden frame and grab it and use radiance  matt okay you watch as this bright vibrant light billows out of it glowing in the vicinity  similar that youve seen it encase the scimitar  taliesin ill admit this is new  travis yeah thats a hell of a thing  taliesin you got to see the first time this /none/ happened  travis right  liam yasha how much of this was under wraps you knew any of this in your time in the circus with  ashley i knew that he woke up and that he did not know who he was but this was the first time that  this has happened where someone has come to us and recognized him from his past  liam as jester molly what about have you ever pooped your pants  travis thats actually in the text thread chain  taliesin not that im well no thats fair sure well it /dung/ was worth it every time  sam im sorry to belabor this but what if you had a good life before this what if you were  famous or rich or had friends or family  ashley i think were quite an amazing person  taliesin okay heres the thing that youre not catching that wasnt me this is mine i dont  want anything from that other person anymore that person is someone else i dont want anything to  do with it i did not feel good coming out of that it was im in for a penny /none/ might as well  im told although i dont entirely remember this part that i only said the word empty over and  over again for the first week  travis marisha and sam empty  taliesin i dont know what that means  liam mt or empty  taliesin empty i dont know barely remember  liam jester i feel your touch on this conversation is this all accurate  matt as far as i can tell yes he did indeed poop his pants  liam and the rest  matt oh that too yes  sam empty  /none/ taliesin that sounds terrible i dont want to remember anything i dont want to anybody elses  baggage in my head and i dont want anybody elses problems thoughts ideas i like this person  right now is a good person is a fine person is a happy person  marisha she kept referencing a book  travis no idea  taliesin sounds shifty  marisha what if we could find the book  taliesin nope i dont want it  liam well i will say i am a little concerned about you know loose ends coming to bite you /none/  and us in the butt however  taliesin we all have a few i assume  liam i believe in second starts and thats enough for me  taliesin can you imagine what it would feel like to not feel anything about anything that had  happened to you so far  travis liam and sam no  marisha yes  taliesin why am i not surprised  sam what do you mean yes you can imagine what its like what its like to not feel anything  before this moment have you died before  marisha no doesnt /none/ mean you have to find meaning in meaningless things  taliesin its very freeing its the best thing its the thing that happened to me its not the  best thing that happened to me its the thing that happened to me i found peace in building a  new person the moonweaver  marisha you know just because you know about your past doesnt mean you have to be beholden to it  sam thats true  marisha if you  taliesin what if it feels that i owe it something  marisha you dont owe your past shit /none/ if i dont feel anything about my past but i still remember  it and i still dont give a fuck about where i came from then why should you care about shit  that you dont even remember  travis thats a layered question  taliesin i spent two years before i met you all cajoling people occasionally ripping them off  occasionally doing a good turn here or there never trust the truth the truth is vicious the  truth thinks you owe it something none of that i like my bullshit its good its happy it makes /none/  other people happy  sam but its not who you are  taliesin it is exactly who i am  travis can i ask you when youre praying over your swords at night are you actually doing anything  taliesin well do you know who the moonweaver is  travis no  taliesin excellent the swords are cheap carnival glass theres nothing special about them  liam may i make a check to see if i have ever heard of the moonweaver  matt make a religion check  sam is the moonweaver not real  liam 23  /none/ matt oh yeah youve definitely heard of the moonweaver  taliesin literally a decorated pair of swords to make them look special  matt the moonweaver is classically more of an elven deity they are a god over night of  shadows music theres a lot of variations to what they go over but they are definitely not one  of the approved religions in the empire and is not considered one of the betrayer gods  classically is an inspiration for a lot of art in classic elven history even some modern the  caretaker of evening trysts has /none/ a lot of unique history to the moonweaver  travis so its you thats special not your swords  taliesin thats true  marisha molly you seem like you have a pretty solidified identity for someone who has only had  consciousness for two years  taliesin things came back quick and the circus helped they were good people they did a lot of  me and joy can fill an awful lot of a persons life  marisha things came back quick do you feel like theres still remnants of whoever you once were that  have informed who /none/ you are now  taliesin maybe i feel tinges of things on occasion nothing i like  marisha interesting  sam if you always lie and bullshit how are we ever going to believe you  taliesin because i always lie and bullshit  marisha i can kind of agree with that cheers to bullshit  taliesin i may be a liar but im never a betrayer im honest in my work and i believe in  doing a good turn ive never cheated you out of money ive never robbed from you i stayed with  that circus for /none/ two years i know how people treat each other its important and all that stuff you  told me before ive got to admit i didnt even listen to any bit of it i was just trying to  teach you a lesson i dont care where youve been i dont care what terrible things any of you  have done youre here now this is how it works  liam as jester molly  taliesin yes darling  liam as jester i have a question  taliesin of course  liam as jester can you really read fortunes  /none/ taliesin i use fortunes to tell people what i see in them but sometimes sometimes i feel like  maybe theres something that tickles the back of my head i will admit  liam as jester you have a feeling  taliesin some days  marisha dont believe him jester  taliesin am i lying  sam he has to be telling the truth  matt no  taliesin thank you  travis he has to  ashley i do feel like you actually weirdly have a gift for that  taliesin i always try to be helpful when i /town/ turn cards for people  marisha you ever think you could actually be doing damage though setting people on false paths  taliesin people are looking for a path theyre looking for a path and ill tell you and this  is true i did my best every town i went to and every town i left no matter how they treated me  and a lot of them treated me with deep disrespect  marisha some people are vulnerable and looking for answers  taliesin i left every town better than i found it  sam which tattoos are /none/ the old ones i mean i dont want to see your naked body or anything but  do you have some  taliesin is it yeah no so i show off the peacock a little bit one of the peacock feathers  on the neck  liam what about your tattoos though  taliesin thank you liam one of the eyes on one of the peacock feathers is a bright crimson red  which any of you if youd ever made a fucking insight check would know god i was waiting for  you to fuck with me its also /none/ the same place that he bleeds every time that he uses any of his  powers theres also a red eye on the snake on the palm and theres a red eye on the snake on the  opposite side of the hand  sam what does that mean what does it mean caleb what does it mean  liam thats a lot of ink man  sam red eyes or something  taliesin there are various  liam hey does any of that symbology mean anything to me  matt not at the moment how much do you show /none/  taliesin im just showing the snake the two snake eyes im showing the peacock eye and then  im going to show the eye in the floral arrangement  marisha come on patterson come on help us out here right now this is your day job  ashley well ill have to look at my tattoo database  laughter  sam get out the black light  taliesin i tried to cover them but they wouldnt take ink so i just did my best  sam theyre not tattoos  taliesin no i dont know what they are  /none/ sam theyre just markings  taliesin i dont know  travis but you dont remember getting them they just appeared  sam they were just there  liam as jester clears throat caleb i have a question  travis you dont have to do every one of these thats shes going to fucking write  liam as jester do you shave your butt as caleb i can truthfully say  taliesin i dont  liam no that was for me  taliesin but now that you bring it up because id never occurred to it i might start  travis /none/ that was to caleb  taliesin oh that was for caleb never mind sorry  sam no thats very interesting good to know  liam now you know that neither molly nor i shave our butt  taliesin who butt shaves  liam and also theres not a lot of hair there anyway so  matt and also theres only a couple minutes more left on the spell  taliesin anything else before were done here  marisha did you ever know anyone who did used to try and set people on wrong paths with their  fortune telling  /none/ taliesin no we tried  thats dangerous work and itll usually backfire no interest in that its mostly  just trying to help people get their shit together did someone send you on the wrong path  marisha no  taliesin thats fair i dont care to be fair  marisha still in the zone of truth now  travis is there anything about you that you dont want us to know  taliesin yes everything i like the safety of it and if i had had my way this wouldve been a  conversation for a later date but /none/ i need to protect you and myself from whatever that is so  you need to know that that is a wild card  travis i appreciate that  marisha well this was fun  sam i feel like we should do this every night but i will say this lucien  taliesin its a terrible name  sam its terrible  taliesin i dont ever want to know who that person is  sam its like a kid with a soft mustache thats not like a real you know like a  taliesin let me make this abundantly clear /dung/ my name is molly that person is dead and not me  its just a person who had this body they abandoned it its mine now  sam i think that you need to know where youve been to know where youre going and i respect your feelings  taliesin and i feel that youre fretfully ignorant and filled with platitudes but i still  like you regardless  sam i feel like when youre ready to know your past i would support that and i would help you  find it  taliesin maybe he killed goblins maybe he /none/ was a goblin hunter maybe he ate them raw  liam perhaps we have learned all we need to learn from this conversation maybe it is time to turn in  we have some things to do tomorrow i am satisfied mollymauk tealeaf for now  taliesin this was not how i expected this to go thank you  marisha for what its worth i like you a little better now  sam me too  marisha you dont have to reciprocate it  taliesin im waiting for the spell to dissipate before i say anything  matt about now /none/ the spell has dissipated  taliesin i both like you more and less at the same time  marisha i get that a lot  sam is the spell gone  matt the spells gone  sam goddamn it yasha tell us everything fuck  matt you can still press her  taliesin thank you dear sighs  travis should we turn in before we head out tomorrow  marisha oh yeah fjord and i found out that were probably going to be facing some undead wispy  things that might electrocute us  sam i think we all did /none/ we all find out no  travis yeah we came out and told you that  taliesin even that undead wispy things is that triggering anything in the brain  matt you know go ahead and make a religion check with advantage  liam the gentleman described the research facility to everybody right before they split off  matt he what  liam the gentleman  matt yes  liam described the research facility the job to everybody  matt to everybody who was present at the table and remained within the vicinity at the moment  liam right so /none/ we all heard that  matt yep  taliesin 19  matt yeah youre familiar with these entities theyre generally undead orbs that  taliesin undead orbs  matt that haunt swamps haunt areas where they seek life force to siphon it and devour it  theyre willowisps  taliesin theyre basically willowisps you usually find them in swamps or things like that  marisha okay do you know how to fight them  taliesin yes am i smoldering  marisha you are  chuckles  taliesin yes  marisha yes its so good its a good movie  taliesin /none/ i know anyway all right  travis well turn in  matt all right you guys all turn in  liam yeah  matt all right an evenings rest takes you as you all take a while ruminating on the events of  the day the information acquired and the path before you you eventually find yourselves to  sleep so you can take your long rests for the night are you doing anything with the sword  travis with the sword  matt yeah  sam the one you mean the  matt the one that you took from /tavern/ yasha  travis oh  matt are you  travis not yet  matt not yet okay anybody else anything all right then as the morning comes to you all wake  up relatively early because you went to bed relatively early its shortly after sunrise you  find yourself conscious some of the first to really hit the downstairs tavern for breakfast  food is served drinks are had and the morning and day is yours what do you wish to do  travis how long does it take to attune to something an hour shit maybe i should /none/ have  marisha a short rest  matt you can do it if you want  marisha yeah you could do it if you want  travis yeah i want to try to attune to the wastehunter blade  matt okay so you focus on it and as you lie there concentrating on it you extend the essence  of whatever pact youve made with this entity into this weapon as you finally finish the period of  time you hold the blade in front of you and it vanishes into the pocket  travis nice  matt as you /none/ force it to apparate once more in your grasp and the blade returns it has the same  hooked shape but now this blade is encrusted with barnacles along the base of it edges of it have  curved around and water continues to drip off this it seems to have transferred whatever the  essence of this pact blade is to this one at this moment you realize whatever weapon you seem to  bond with in this way will carry that same aquatic essence based on the communion that youve acquired  taliesin did you do this alone /none/ or was i in the room when this happened i would have loved to  have watched this  travis yeah you were there  taliesin i walk up get a little uncomfortably close put my hand on your chest the power was in  you all along see you at breakfast  liam oh no im going to scuttle off and go over to pumats i have just a short little shopping  travis oh i need to go as well  liam oh you do okay so im having bacon down below so i will wait until i /none/ see you

equivalent do not fuck me here  caleb do not fuck me  liam not interested but i will ask about the items you are /none/ looking for  sam seems pretty aggressive for a favor  matt classic beauregard  travis youll like this pumat sol is how would you describe unique  liam well not oneofakind  travis mmhmm  laughter  travis maybe we should just  taliesin did you just tell a joke  liam no  taliesin sighs its a shame it was a very good one  sam germans dont tell jokes  laughter  matt zemnians  sam zemnians experience only pain  laughter  travis anybody else coming to the invulnerable vagrant besides the three of us yep /none/ four  ashley whats it called  travis the invulnerable vagrant  sam is everybody going to go  marisha ill stay here and watch horris me and jester right  matt jester

travis when i come home all the lights will be off with just a candle and a chair  liam when you get home just the blinds are open  matt all righty so for those of you who are making your way towards the pentamarket you  eventually find the outskirts of the invulnerable vagrant you enter the interior and there are two  other individuals that are doing business with two of the pumats  travis do we /none/ recognize them  matt you do not they seem to be just asking questions and looking about the vicinity  marisha before they leave can i be like dont forget theyre looking for us to molly  taliesin do i recognize these people  matt you do not  taliesin okay i may have the chill cloak flipped to try and be a little less conspicuous  rolling around for what its worth  matt okay  liam you did the artist formerly known as prince  matt so as you enter the chamber and you see the two pumats /none/ are busy the counter is currently not  helmed and theyre middiscussion but one of them turns and kind of acknowledges you enter oh  thats real nice to see you just relax there a bit if you need help immediately we can see if  primes available  travis well if you wouldnt mind this is one of our compatriots this is yasha new to your establishment  matt yasha thats a wonderful name i cant help you because im helping this person but just  hang tight a second pumat hell be right with you  ashley isnt /none/ he pumat  matt you see two of them that look identical in the room  ashley oh you guys are twins  matt something like that hell be right with you turns around  liam just breathe it in  ashley okay  matt you hear a couple of heavy footfalls what sounds like a toppling of some metallic pan that  clattering metal like ah shi hello the curtain opens and you see one of the pumats but  with a set of goggles right above the head an apron on with a bunch of different tools and /none/  various accoutrements stuffed into different pockets hey so im helping someone who needs help  travis oh actually  ashley okay  travis this is our friend yasha shes new to your establishment  ashley hello  matt right now youve been here before youre working with the other ones all right morning

 matt oh are /none/ you talking about a dagger or a dart or something like that  ashley darts daggers darts  matt you can probably go to a blacksmith and get that made for you i dont really craft things  here from their base components we generally take them and i enchant them to a better degree i make  generally notsogreat things pretty great  ashley oh  liam i gather we all hear this conversation yeah  matt yeah and youre catching that pumat prime is a little surlier than the other ones he seems like  hes a little /none/ more down to business than the various versions of him out there  taliesin were probably going to be dealing with some restless spirits actually so if theres  anything to deal with some of these phantasmagorical creatures willowisps that  sort of thing  matt ah interesting youre going to be dealing with some of the spiritual realm you say  taliesin yeah inevitably  matt all right lets see pretty sure i got maybe a vial or two of holy water if thats what  youre looking for thats not usually my purview but we keep a couple /none/ in stock just in case let me  see what i can muster goes ahead and rummages through in the back you hear more metal and glass  clanking and one box gets shifted off to the side ah dang nabbit  travis yasha do you have any healing potions  ashley i dont thats actually i wanted to get some lets see just want to double check to see  if i do  matt all righty comes out ive got two vials of holy water remaining those will run you about  25 gold pieces apiece if you /none/ want them  taliesin perfect thats exactly what i was looking for was two vials of holy water  matt well look at that its like it was meant to be straight up destiny  sam laughs  taliesin probably need some healing potions or something  ashley yeah do you have some healing potions  matt ah well you see funny thing with all of these adventurers keep coming in and clearing me  out we got maybe two more but you got to give us time to restock you guys your friends here have  been mighty hungry /none/  ashley well theyre the mighty nein  laughter  travis oh my god that head shake afterwards  marisha her initial regret  travis the bail  marisha immediate nope nah  ashley how much are they  matt those will put you back about 50 gold pieces apiece since we have the friendly discount  of repeated customers isnt that right one of mes one of the pumats goes thats correct  theyve been in here a few times hes like all right great thank you for looking out there  buddy all right so  travis im /none/ really glad to hear that friendly discounts getting even friendlier that really  nice cloak you have on the wall  matt yep  travis how much is that  matt oh youre referring to that protection cloak lets see here grunts takes it off the  counter checks it thatll run you back about 800 gold pieces  travis i fell face first into some coin recently i think ill take that  sam whoa  matt well you watch the demeanor shift a little bit from like the im busy like well  happy to see a big /none/ spender coming on first thing in the morning you start seeing more of the  connection with the other pumats  liam ah regular percival de rolo over here  matt well might i have your name i dont think weve had the pleasure personally  travis fjord  matt fjord  sam tough  matt fjord tough pumat sol prime and i believe this is now known as fjords cloak  ashley so does that mean that the ive seen a deal somewhere with somebody also threw in some  healing spells when they bought a cloak is that /none/ a thing  matt youre looking for a discount for the healing potion  ashley yeah  matt make a persuasion check  ashley my charismas fucked  matt i know but hey you never know  travis i like it  liam yasha and caleb in napoleon dynamite  ashley 14  matt

/none/ two  ashley ill take them  matt all righty here you go  ashley thank you  matt okay  liam im sorry i have a simple request  matt thats all right simple requests are always open what do you need

you miss with it  matt look im just being straight with you its a pretty useful thing on occasion  liam what about yourself  sam oh im fine hes already theyre already making me something  liam yeah but ive seen you throw a dagger or two in your time and you always have to walk out  to the tree and pull it out or walk out to the gnoll and pull it out this way it would come  right back to you think about it  sam throwing a dagger just seems so inelegant to /none/ me i dont know why theyre meant to cut food  and to eat food with  matt i mean no offense to any of you here but i got to get right back to work looks like one of  my mes is available to help you for the rest of this  liam i understand if she changes her mind well let you know  matt yeah no well let them know thank you so

need to aw man  liam how high are the ceilings in this store  matt the ceilings probably about tenfoot  liam i low how your voice went low voice to imitating matt the ceilings /none/ about okay got it  matt hi sorry about that i was helping a customer but hes left now not purchasing  anything so im happy to help you what can i do for you  taliesin i think were pretty well taken care of at this point  travis we got everything we need  matt all righty well have a wonderful day and come by whenever you like big spender i saw that  sam is my flask coming along all right  matt coming along fine i think thats part of what pumats working on right now /none/  sam add any sort of shiny finish to it or some extra flair or baubles to it that would be fine  matt ill see what we can do thank you  sam thank you  matt thank you  sam all right thank you  matt all right thank you  travis we leave unique huh  ashley thats a ive never seen any i thought they were related and then they all have the same  name so i guess thats another thing  travis yeah youre quite the word wizard with the haggling there  ashley /none/ listen i realize im not great with people just no need to point it out  travis i was being honest you actually got money off  ashley oh i forgot about that yes i did  travis yeah nice job  taliesin ive never seen you blush before  liam she is quite pale its hard to tell  ashley well what do we need  travis she doesnt like the spotlight  liam attentions a bitch isnt it  ashley and liam yeah  travis nein  ashley nein  taliesin we should probably go to the blacksmith /none/ at some point  matt easily enough at the blacksmith for the sake of brevity here yeah you can pick up  liam a thousand throwing stars  marisha yeah for ten gold just ball bearings and throwing stars  matt for a single dart which is the equivalent well say there are darts and there are well say  throwing stars sure why not because of the archives nearby there probably would be a use  for them theyre not often called for its probably a surprise that somebody wanted to  purchase them but they have about 20 /none/ well say throwing stars which act as darts for five  copper a piece  liam i hand yasha one of the ten gold that beau gave me this is beaus money so i think shed  want you to purchase them  ashley well she gave you the money  liam yeah but she doesnt like me very much  ashley well maybe that will make her like you more  liam thats doubtful  ashley why do you think that  liam why do i think its doubtful she will like me she has threatened me constantly she /none/ is very  aggressive shes very surly she doesnt smile a lot unless there is a spell cast on her ive only  seen her punch people in the face  taliesin has she punched you in the face yet  liam give her time  taliesin i think she likes you  ashley the only reason i might disagree is because she did give you money  taliesin ill take that money itll be no problem  liam i give one gold to yasha and i hold on to the other nine  all nein  ashley what are /none/ you going to do with the rest of the money  liam im going to give it back to her  taliesin we can to be fair get all 20 of those throwing darts for one gold  ashley okay  matt okay so the transaction completed you have a bunch of these throwing stars theyre metallic  theyre triangular in shape and bladed at the edges pretty light  ashley can i test one out  matt sure go ahead and roll a d20  taliesin yeah  ashley nope seven no sorry nine  all nein  matt /none/ you throw it towards this post and it whoosh whinnies this horse all of a sudden  bucks and kicks the side of the stable nearby and you hear the wood crack from the kick all of the  sudden you hear voices of the two stable hands trying to hold back this horse so its 19  throwing stars  ashley fuck sorry  taliesin it was worth it  ashley admittedly im not good at throwing things but it looked really cool  travis did we bring horris with us  marisha no im watching him while you /none/ guys are doing this im like check under your bed did  you leave anything behind go pee one last time man come on come on  liam too real for me too real  travis camp counselor beau incredible  matt caleb molly and jester actually as you guys are walking back you notice that there are  now clusters of about three or four crownsguard at different places that are in the process of asking  questions to people going from place to place and inquiring  taliesin i am going to turn around and immediately head towards /tavern/ the other bar the  evening nip  sam jesters not with us  matt right shes not with you youre right  taliesin im going to let you know tell them im hiding at the bar and ill meet them there when  its time  liam we see guards asking around  matt yeah like talking to people asking questions  liam okay i am just going to pull my cloak up and put the hood up thats all  matt okay you guys make your way back to the leaky tap there what little horris had on /none/ him a  little bit of change and materials to leave is ready to go beau and jester are propped and ready  as well i assume what do you guys do  sam should we go on our mission or should we get rid of horris  travis well were dropping him off  liam well horris is part of the mission  travis yeah well be dropping him off at the evening nip  liam we should go lets make hay while the sun shines  sam drop off horris and then go do we know where were /town/ going for this mission  travis a mile out of town  marisha the evening nip and then theyre going to escort us out  sam okay  travis well be blinded  ashley beau caleb got these for you  marisha gasps perfect thank you  ashley there were 20 but one of them fell out of the bag  liam yes they were so heavy and i am so weak that i gave them to yasha to carry heres your change  marisha thank you why are you acting so weird about this  liam im just weird /none/ in general  marisha thanks for the change thank you yasha  ashley one of thems missing but i think it fell out of the  sam it was an accident there was nothing suspicious about it  ashley i think it fell out of the bag  travis we should go okay horris were going to try and get you out of here  matt yes thank you thank you whatever you need  travis what  liam this is a liam thing not a caleb thing  matt yeah  liam im just going to say right now /none/ where we are frumpkin im telling him to follow us all  about 55 to 60 feet back behind us  matt okay easy enough all right as you guys make your way towards the evening nip horris is  looking a bit nervous but does look around and seems genuinely very thankful hes like  seriously this means a lot to both me and dolan thank you  marisha yeah youre welcome and then i put a bag over his head and i say sorry sorry  travis i think that can probably wait until we are at the /none/ evening nip  marisha well he cant see where were going right  travis yeah sure he can we just dont want crownsguard thinking were walking around a hooded person  marisha i figured were all right  matt probably hold on that until we get well say for the purposes of this youre pretty close  to the evening nip when you do this  travis okay we made it nows the time  marisha okay okay now over his head  liam 600am wake up  travis were just pushing around a guy with a bag on his /tavern/ head hey nah its cool  matt hes had too much to drink  marisha hes going through a jake gyllenhaal phase  travis high pitched his eyes are dilated  liam happy halloween  matt you guys enter the evening nip clive is there at the end hey youre a friend with a bag  travis we made arrangements with the gentleman downstairs  matt all right grunts he leads you to the back shoves things off of the latch pulls up the  trapdoor down the stairs and you eventually make your way back into the tavern below /none/ where  mollymauk is waiting nervously drinking  liam i dont like the proximity here frumpkins gone out there then once were in the  speakeasy sorry i just ate a cracker  matt thats okay  liam frumpkins under a table  matt okay gotcha all right as you guys head back down horris is like i trust you guys i  trust you you make your way down the room is not as busy as it was last you left theres maybe  six individuals in there most of them are the individuals who were previously posted with /none/ rifles  or new individuals also posted with rifles up at the top there is the gentleman finishing a meal  at the table with sorah his bodyguard at the side ah i see youve made it he sets the  things down pushes the plate to the side so i take it this is your contraband  sam yes  matt very well and you would wish this smuggling to head where our cleanest to be fair  our cleanest means of smuggling out would be actually through the river after you pass through  as that leads us /none/ to the northern swamps of berleben and that would be probably one of the  safest spaces still easily able to keep him out of sight and to a safe space out of the crownsguards watch  travis outstanding we defer to your expertise  matt great then well wait an hour after your passage forward and send your contraband on his  way to safety with two individuals to escort him and lead him to civilization beyond the outskirts  sound fair  sam yes  travis sounds fair  matt very well take care of him please they /none/ pull the shoulders of horris back and horris is  like all right be safe  travis its all right go with them youll be fine  matt and you know what kara and well say dweez you go ahead and lead them down to the  sam dweez  matt lead them blindfolded of course through the underworks to docks and send them up the way  to their agreed upon task you see kara come back through one of the doors on the steps and behind  you see that creepy gnome from earlier sitting behind  marisha /none/ dweez  matt creepy chuckling kara goes all right well and she pulls a few pieces of cloth it  looks like theyre used to moving individuals through and they have already prepared blindfolds  in place she passes them out to you and instructs you all to put on a blindfold and take a hand  liam as soon as the blindfold is on im going to pass my sight and hearing over to frumpkin  marisha nice  taliesin thats a good call  liam if it works  marisha ill hold on to caleb to make sure /none/ he can still walk  matt okay  liam thanks blind woman  marisha well they said all hold hands  liam okay yeah boof  matt whos at the very front and whos at the very back of this chain  travis ill stay at the front  marisha sorry doing the best i can sorry  liam whack sorry  matt fjord front  marisha sorry had to get an opportunity in  matt whos in the back  travis wouldnt mind having some muscle up front  ashley okay ill be behind grog fjord  taliesin ill /none/ go behind yasha  matt okay whos after mollymauk  travis jester  matt jester all right whos after jester  marisha im with caleb in the back  matt okay nott  sam ill hold onto caleb as well  taliesin yeah thats a good order  matt so there and we have frumpkin trailing behind at the very back so fjord at the very  front kara takes your hand and begins pulling and in the very very back caleb this tiny gnome  hand grabs your hand and goes heh heh hold on heh heh  liam /none/ this is okay  matt they loop you through the room a few times to discombobulate you and direction in the  chamber and pull you through in different ways to prevent you from orienting where you were and  where youre going eventually youre led through a doorway you hear some things shift and then  turned around a bit and then led down a ladder the ladder goes down for about 20 or so feet  before your feet touch some sort of soft dirt packed dirttype feeling the sound of the music  and chatter vanishes up /none/ ahead and you hear as soon as you all head down the ladder a latch  close and lock above you  liam how did my cat do  matt your cat managed to actually make a stealth check  marisha come on kitty come on frumpkin  matt for frumpkin  liam oh shit  travis what  liam total shit five  matt five  liam yes  matt as frumpkins trying to trail behind dweez turns and goes heh no heh heh and puts a  hand out and grabs frumpkin by the scruff and holds frumpkin /tavern/ up and then throws frumpkin back  into the bar  liam okay if i saw that i would snap my fingers and make frumpkin poof out  matt okay  liam im going to bite my tongue and bring frumpkin back  matt okay dweez is clutching the back of your hand and goes confused sound  liam its just a nervous tic im a nervous fellow sorry  matt creepy laughter  travis what the fuck laughs  matt okay so you head back down you are led down a tunnel it weaves a bit you turn to /dung/ the  right down another tunnel for 100 200 300 feet  liam snaps fingers frumpkin back in  matt frumpkin back in  liam 50 feet behind  matt right you can see this a bit these are tight individual tunnels it feels almost like a  mine in the fact that it has occasionally a wood structure for support between it a lot of it is  packed with earth thats been carved out eventually youll split off into two and youll  see what looks to be a small resting chamber with another set of tables and /none/ a bunk you go past  another area and theres occasional torchlight set up on parts of the wall you can see a couple of  shifty individuals that are in the process of stacking crates somewhere  liam theres other people down here doing shit as we walk by  matt yeah theyll walk by you and occasionally look one of them will stop and inspect and move  on no one seems to fuck with you at the minute because youre with kara in fact one of them  seems to get close to you and looks and /none/ sees dweez and goes ugh and just moves on you do hear a  noise a strange like guttural animal snorting and you hear whip crack animal grunting  echoing down the hall you move around one spot and theres one archway that frumpkin passes by  looking down and you can see theres a pit and there are a number of cages set up in there about  four of them that have different creatures inside its too lowlit for frumpkin to really  see from this distance whats in there but one of them is currently having a /none/ bit of a conniption fit  and you see three cloaked figures that are on the outside one of them is trying to whip elements of  it that are coming at it the other one is trying to prod it in the sides and its getting agitated  liam as jester jester has a question she would like to know what it smells like in here  matt at this point it smells like wet dirt and earth thats about it it smells like a dank  subterranean tunnel as you pass by the creature smell you can smell /dung/ hints of dung fresh and old  and some sort of pheromone like a very strong pheromone thats very unpleasant the scent  continuing on you move through another tunnel another figure walks by and stops as you pass and  watches you as you continue down another set of stairs and then eventually the echo begins to  get a little louder your feet hit wood frumpkin can see this as you pass in youve hit a dock  this is now a natural cavern the moisture catches you first what was initially a somewhat cavernous  damp has /none/ now become very moist and you can hear the slight sound of a river moving through  frumpkin can see this too theres an entire underground river that is now curving past this  entrance way leading in two different directions along this river you can see there are a few  lanterns that are set up with this soft greenish glow theyre perpetually burning in certain areas  and are bolted into the rock and stone there on the side of this dock you can see four different  boats that are currently roped and tied to the edge /none/ there there is a figure sitting on a stool  who is taking a dagger and moving it on the edge of one of the wooden poles that is on the very  outside end of the dock at this point all of your blindfolds are removed and youve come to the  end of this part of the journey  sam oh  matt kara says sorry about that but you were respectful thank you she collects the  blindfolds and dweez who is still clutching your hand lets go and goes creepy chuckle  sam ugh  matt /none/ kara goes all right two of these ships are yours to use youre heading up that path  there about a mile or so its with the river thankfully so the stream will be carrying you  through a set of paddles to each of you whoever wants to helm that thats up to you pay  attention from what ive been told youll see the change in the texture of the wall on the  lefthand side traveling northward look for the small collapse on that end  travis collapse in the wall  matt correct be spry sometimes /none/ some creatures do find their way living down here so be ready to  move past quickly or find a way to duck them if you can  travis we can take it from here  matt all right good luck  sam thank you  travis youll be able to find your way back right  matt well be fine  travis im not good at joking  matt the guy at the edge of the docks sits up and kara goes the back two for these folks let them  go gentlemans orders he doesnt say anything just /none/ sits up you see the hood thats up he pulls  it back a bit and you can see there is this older grizzled human with very short gray hair deep  scar across the back of his head that curves off to the top of where his receding hairline is its  just been very deepset where the skin dimples heavily along the edge of the scar hes got this  very scruffy gray and white beard his heads a bit sunk into his shoulders he walks over to the  edge and unties each of the boats and /none/ hands the rope to one of you the first one goes to fjord  and the other one just goes to beau goes back to his station and sits down sticks his blade in the  side of the wood and keeps wedging it in there you get a better look up there and you can see  this wood is splintered to shit on the top this guy has been over time slowly pushing away at  this wood for whatever amusement he needs to pass the time down here where hes stationed  travis these boats look like /dung/ theyll fit three to four each  matt these boats look like theyll fit about four people each  travis okay all right two boats jesters in mine yasha you should go in the second boat  were going to need muscle in case we need to move fast  ashley okay  liam i get in with nott in the yasha boat  sam whos piloting our boat  marisha yashas one and then jesters the other  sam shes piloting do you know how to drive a boat  ashley well well find out  sam scared noise /none/  ashley yes i do  sam oh okay youre so needlessly scaring me for no reason  matt so we have fjord jester molly and beau in one boat and yasha and caleb and nott in the  other is that how it is  marisha sure  liam and i send away frumpkin  matt okay  sam im going to place on my ring of water walking that i stole from jester  travis is this a boat with like two oars  matt two oars on each side yeah  travis all right  matt you /none/ guys all get in it rocks a bit as you all adjust your weight and find a place where the  boat itself isnt listing too far to one side or the other the river current is pulling it along  so as soon as you step off the last person holding the rope they immediately start following  the current of the river which is not rapid but it is moving at a fair speed you all gather  yourselves and follow it down and as you progress you notice those green lanterns that are  lit only seem /none/ to cover the vicinity of that dock until eventually you are going into a pitch  black cavern  liam on our own  matt hmm  liam we are all on our own here right  matt youre all alone  travis caleb  liam ja  travis you want to do your read my mind  liam poof poof  marisha i bring out and put on the goggles  liam i let two of the globules hover around the front of each boat one at the front and one at  the back of each boat  /none/ matt all right so as the orbs  marisha so romantic you guys  liam and matt singing there you see her  matt and marisha singing there across the way  travis singing yah yah yah  liam singing shes got a giant sword but who cares youve got to ask her  marisha singing yah yah yah  taliesin hey beau i pull out one of the holy water flasks think you know what to do with this  marisha i think i do  taliesin just in case  marisha i put it away  taliesin who /none/ do you think the other one should go to  marisha anyone who can beat face but doesnt have magic yasha maybe nott  taliesin maybe nott might be safer  sam what do i do with it  taliesin youre not in a boat with us  sam shouting what do i do with it  marisha you dip your ammunition in it  taliesin this one you throw  matt this one you throw  marisha oh this one is a throwing one  matt this isnt an oil this is water  marisha oh never mind  /none/ taliesin know how to throw stuff  sam no ive never thrown anything in my life  taliesin if there was a basket for trash and you threw it  sam as hes talking i throw a gold coin at his head  matt okay roll a d20 and add your dexterity modifier  taliesin wow thats exciting  sam thats a d20 i mean thats a natural 20  taliesin that doesnt count thats cocked  liam sure it counts it counts doubly as much  sam do you want me to redo  liam no  matt what /none/ are you doing  sam redo way less  taliesin way less  sam dexterity what  matt add your dexterity modifier  sam ten  matt it goes right past you hear it splash into the water below  taliesin ill take that so when we get into the boat together im going to give you the other  holy water flask  liam as jester how big is the chamber we are traveling in  matt the chamber seems to shift at times sometimes it squeezes in where its just the river  and the edges of the /none/ tunnel at about 15 feet from side to side  liam as jester with my darkvision how high is the ceiling in here  matt the ceiling is roughly 15 feet as well 15 to ten feet sometimes it coasts down and becomes a  bit lower it is a natural river so  liam as jester i grab the edge of the boat and i say oskar is there no echo  matt echoing oskar  liam as jester that was pretty good  matt as you guys head deeper into the subterranean tunnels towards your destination  weapons /none/ at your side prepared for whatever comes in the near future  liam god damn hes going to end the game  all no  matt were going to go ahead and end tonights game  liam damn it  matt we dont have laura here weve had two episodes that went
