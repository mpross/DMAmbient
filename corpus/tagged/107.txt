people watching the show thank you and if this your first time live or your first time  seeing the show hopefully youre not too confused and welcome as /dung/ well first and foremost for those  who havent seen it yet weve been doing spotify playlists for each of the players and the  characters we just finished that whole sequence with mine that went up today so if you havent  had a chance to check it out you can go ahead and check it out i did a playlist based around many  of the npcs in the world of exandria that vox machina have come across and just a couple little  tidbits about their characters and their backgrounds and one song per npc that rounds /none/ out  their personalities so check it out if youre interested hopefully you like it and you also get  an eye into my taste in music too  sam a lot of classic rock  matt we had a new comic come up this week didnt we  taliesin we have a new comic  marisha new comic  liam drink  marisha yes based off of real events that

some of  the text and stuff so if youve already downloaded go to the website and download the  newest one its 12 its called the bloodhunter /none/ its a retool of the witchhunter taking it away  from the promotional aspect that it was tied to back in october i was able to retool it and make  it something a little more wholly my own and my own unique design as opposed to being tied to the  preexisting ip so its got some cool abilities i hope you like it if you feel like running it in  your game or allowing your players to do so have fun  marisha and its got the seal of approval  matt not the seal of approval /none/ i would say i did manage to have some wonderful feedback from mike  mearls from dungeons and dragons at wizards of the coast he was very very sweet enough to give me  notes and ideas when i was going through the redesign process so thank you tremendously mike  for that its still my real first homebrew class that ive ever designed so its far from perfect  and

critmases weve had a few ideas that the critters actually gave us to focus the  idea of critmas a little bit  taliesin the spirit of critmas  sam on what it originally was jesus crit  laughter  sam thats what the holiday was always about  travis no  sam and now were getting it back to jesus crit  laughter  sam no  marisha yep well leave it at that  travis you cant do any better that  matt so tomorrow youll be able /none/ to read this really inaccurate description by sam riegel the  critters guide to critmas and last but not least if anybody has any other announcements or  projects coming up that theyd like to mention theres a wii u game that just came out called  xenoblade chronicles x where i voice a character named lao that just came out recently so if  youre a fan of those awesome rpgs i will be really subdued and arrogant in your face  travis subdued and arrogant  taliesin we get that for free  matt exactly every week anything /none/ else guys we good  taliesin yeah  matt all righty now lets get down to the nitty gritty  sound effect noises  travis was that who wants to be a millionaire  sam yeah of course its got to be right  matt the lights swish all right so to get you guys up to speed as fast as i can this is a  really long arc the briarwoods being a family that five years ago took over the city of  whitestone where percy hails from murdered his family and he barely escaped with his life /town/ years  later came back into the folds of vox machinas existence and it was decided to go ahead and hunt  them down and save the city of whitestone upon arriving they began to stir rebellion in the town  against this horrible undead menace controlled by lady briarwood herself after this rebellion was  incited fires were burning individuals were killed that were responsible for keeping the  people down and just generally bad people all around were being slaughtered by our intrepid  adventurers they made their way into whitestone castle where they had uncovered some information /none/  about the ziggurat a project in which the briarwoods had been developing something beneath  the city of whitestone and discovered that percys sister cassandra who was thought to be  dead long ago actually still survived and was being kept in the castle she joined the party as  you guys fought your way down underneath the city of whitestone through a series of tunnels finding  yourselves unintentionally locked within a trap a retooled version of what was previously an acid  distillery for the whitestone thats actually mined from the surrounding mountains and thought  left /none/ for dead by the briarwoods themselves in which vax was charmed and taken along with them  and cassandra showed herself  laura you were the one who got us into the acid in the first place thank you for that  liam you dont think they would have done that  laura i dont know  travis well never know  laura well never know  marisha acid sucks i never want to encounter acid again every time we do its bad its  always bad  matt well acids bad in general you know its not like oh /none/ this acids fine  liam citric acid is pretty good  laura pretty delicious  marisha preserves apples  matt i stand corrected  liam could it be a citric acid trap  matt no its probably not going to happen  travis damn it we should have done that  check last time  can we check for citric acid  you can certainly try  laughter  matt its not acid resistance on your armor its citric acid resistance  sam you dont get scurvy  matt very possible anyway back to the story upon facing the danger /none/ of this trap and seeing  cassandra turn redcoat to them with the briarwoods the party managed to think their way  out of the trap before too much damage was taken and following the briarwoods to the final chamber  where the ziggurat was constructed where apparently there is some sort of ritual underway to some  entity they worship or work with that they refer to as the whispered one upon following the  party dividing up and following up the sides of the ziggurat they managed to catch an encounter  with the briarwoods a charmed vax /none/ and cassandra before they could enter the actual ritual  chamber  a battle commenced where thanks to proper preparation did not go all so poorly and in the  process sylas briarwood was destroyed through a combination of sunbeam via keyleth and some pike  shield deflection a very avengers moment with a hint of phallic imagery sylass destruction  sent delilah into a mournful wail and she decided to try and complete the ritual herself although  it may or may not have been too soon to do so dimension doored her way into the ritual room  /none/ which you guys followed over the wall she seemed to complete the ritual creating this small  vacuous spinning black sphere that is locked in place vex was nearly felled by a spell as she  attempted to fly in and stop it the party then rushed in to aid vex percy took a shot that  intentionally did not finish lady briarwood just taking off her right arm as she fell unconscious  bleeding out  vex unconscious from the fall and also on the cusp of dying the party rushed in to help her and  realized seemingly /none/ the vicinity around this orb had cut all magic so thus they were snatched up  and escorted off the side of the ziggurat and that was where we left the last game to pick up  where we were who had vex in their arms last time was that you  liam grog  matt grog you have vex in your arms who has delilah and who has cassandra  liam grog has both  laura he has both of us im piled on top of delilah  matt okay so you have delilah and and vex who has /none/ cassandra  taliesin i think i have cassandra  matt okay so as you guys are rushing down the steps of the ziggurat itself the green glasslike  jade material slowly fading into the whitestone as you rush towards the base with what little bit of  light was available to you from the small bits of torches placed at the bottom of the ziggurat and  what light sources you brought with you you find yourselves at the very bottom of the dirt looking  around theres the exit where you guys originally entered this chamber you do also /none/ see a number of  small metallic carts some turned on their sides you can see crumpled bits of whitestone and  shards of that green glass residuum material left out you can see theres piles of leftover  building materials that are scattered about the floor of this area  liam are you saying that keyleth and i are caught up at this point because i know that people  started going out of the temple keyleth ran in i handed vex to grog i ran after  matt so you guys are still a little bit behind the /none/ rest of the group youre on your way now  youre just now rushing down the stairs of the ziggurat while the rest of you have reached the  bottom  travis she rolled that natural 20 that kept her from probably getting sucked into uranus  marisha yep probably  matt save versus uranus  marisha that would have been bad save versus uranus is that what you said  matt that is what i said  liam put it in the handbook  taliesin its like were 12  matt the next errata document  travis and lady /none/ briarwood is manacled  matt shes manacled behind you and cassandra is tied up as the rest of you rush down to the  bottom minus vax and keyleth do you wish to wait for them or push on to the tunnel where you  entered  travis fuck them we keep running were trying to get out of the area right  laura im barely conscious right now right  marisha i was yelling in the earpiece fuck it run  matt so you know that theyre following you  laura grog  travis yes  laura get this /none/ bitch off of me  travis oh sorry yeah fuck it its like carrying coats hold on so i put one in each  arm there you go  laura are we leaving  travis yeah were trying to get out of here as fast as we can how are you feeling  laura grog and i reach up and grab onto his beard this is a beautiful beard  watch out for traps  matt so at this point as youre having this discussion you guys are rushing down and you  guys see this as youre rushing down /none/ the ziggurat the radiant energy that is currently the form of  pike seems to have slowly dwindled and she looks over her shoulder with a look of immediate fear as  it blinks out  marisha what why the why  sam because of technology and also the story  travis laughs i didnt even know she was gone  marisha i didnt either  sam pike no no pike  matt it seems as if whatever antimagical aura has slowly pushed the divine connection that keeps  her present from the current vicinity  marisha did your computer /none/ die  sam also the battery died on the computer  liam its that black orb  laura i didnt know where can we plug it in at  matt so you guys push on making your way to the cavern and heading back towards the undercroft  vicinity of whitestone  travis yeah let me know when we leave that bigass room that the ziggurat is in were still  in it right  matt you guys have just now made your way towards the exit tunnel so youre just now leaving  travis i remember the tunnels sucking /none/ boobytrapwise  taliesin not until were past the gold room the glass room  liam i marked all the traps  taliesin all the traps are marked  sam all the traps that we found  laura no remember there was one the poison dust one which were immune to still  taliesin but that already got set off  travis can i check for traps as i go  matt sure well you push and make your way into  sam youre checking for traps  travis yeah  sam youre holding two ladies  matt as you guys /none/ rush behind  travis normal saturday night my friend  sam oh boy  matt you head back into the tunnel having to lower your head a little bit as youre carrying  this payload youre lumbering through giant goliath body just stomping through  marisha a payload he called you a payload  matt yeah you come to where there is the partiallydissolved stone door and you rush  underneath and using all of your back muscle make a strength check  travis okay thats good 24  matt grunts tensing the entirety of your muscle structure  laura /none/ im not that heavy  matt oh its not about you being heavy its about the door itself not being quite large enough  for him to come through carrying that large of people you grunts lift it and you hear the  stone scraping noise shift as its forcefully pushed up you hear snaps of things breaking or  supports that were keeping it in place as you essentially break the door and jam it upward  giving you enough space to pull through the rest of the party  travis i fucking hate doors dont we all  /none/ sam we do  matt indeed greatest nemesis of vox machina  taliesin is cassandra awake or is she unconscious  matt shes unconscious now  taliesin damn it  matt you make your way into the top level of the distillery room down the pathway into the upward  ramp to the opposite side the door open and you are now outside of the distillery trap  travis its the danger area  laura oh no  travis youre out  sam wait so whos at zero health  travis one point  laura im at one point of /none/ health  sam we have potions now were out of the magic  travis cant you heal some people  taliesin we can try a  travis i have potions too but  marisha are we out of the room  laura were out of the room  travis yeah were out of the room  matt youre not currently with them though youre behind with vax trying to catch up  travis i have a common can i try giving vex a common healing potion  matt yeah you want to stop for a second and pull it out /none/  travis i fucking drop lady briarwood on her face hard  sam oh no she might die  laura oh no she could die die  matt okay she thudding noise rolls bounces a little bit from the sheer force of the throw  youre not even paying attention as to whether or not shes still breathing you reach in your pouch  and bring out your potion set vex down and hand it to her  travis please work  matt you go ahead and heal 2d4 plus two hit points  laura oh really  matt yeah /none/  laura okay wheres my d4 plus two oh thats good thats a whole eight points  matt there you go thats actually a pretty good roll  travis and it stays it works  matt at this point as you guys have pushed outside of that room it appears to be functioning  again  laura yay  travis oh good that took can you heal people its a yes or no question  laura im awake enough  taliesin i can try  laura im awake enough i wake up and i cast cure wounds on myself  /none/ matt okay go for it roll for that  taliesin i cant do that  laura im like ooh i love me so much cure me  matt at 1st level  laura i think 2nd level i have enough  matt so 2d8 plus your spellcasting modifier whatever your wisdom modifier is  laura that was not even as good as the common potion oh well sort of 14  matt okay  travis still pretty low  laura so basically full hit points at this point  travis i feel like we should heal you up just a /dung/ touch more what are you at  laura 23 points  travis thats pretty fucking low  sam all right ill give you my greater heal  travis i have one she can have mine  laura really  travis yeah im a giant  sam no ill take this one i want you to have my greater healing potion it would mean so much to  me if you would take it drink  laura thanks scanlan  sam no problem if pike were here id give it to her but  laura understandable  sam shes not so /none/ youre pretty cool too  laura okay thanks buddy what do i roll for that  sam 4d4 plus four  laura whoa i feel so strong now  travis youd better roll strong  laura 11 so im at 34 points  sam hey as a thank you for that  laura what  sam what about that gun  laura scanlan  sam just let me hold it  travis oh he did just give you a potion  laura im just letting you know youre not skilled with ranged attacks  taliesin theres nothing he can do /none/ with it anyway i have all the ammunition  laura i know  sam thats what you think my pickpocket fingers are faster than you could ever imagine  taliesin i really dont think they are  travis sounds like a challenge  matt at this point keyleth and vax catch up to the rest of you guys  sam ill take that  travis how did it go did you kill the little black thing of death  marisha slowly no i didnt  travis vex gave scanlan a gun i dont think its loaded  marisha oh god /none/ be careful  sam does it look cool  taliesin no  laura we need to take care of that orb  marisha no i tried to jam a piece of the magic glass the jammy magic glass into it and im  probably lucky that i was able to pull away as quickly as i did because i think it eats  everything around it  laura so wait its still there  marisha still there yeah  travis is it moving at all  marisha its doing its really fast spinny thing  travis what about all the /none/ bodies in the room are they still like moans  marisha i thought i could maybe go into my wildshape and bring down the building i  thought maybe if i collapsed the building maybe it was drawing some sort of energy from the net of  intertwined bodies but i couldnt because it was blocking all magic capabilities  laura can i look over at lady briarwood and do a check on her to see if she looks stable  matt sure which at this point just a note in all the chaos and all the intent trying to /none/ get  things out of there youre just now starting to realize that the seeming spell that you placed on  the whole party has also been canceled as part of whatever this trigger antifield was so you all  look around and realize oh we arent a bunch of percys and cassandras  travis im beautiful again  taliesin thank you  laura thats good because i noticed your beard  travis thats right  laura thats right  taliesin are you checking on lady briarwood  laura i am  matt trinkets nuzzling the body  taliesin keep /none/ her unconscious  laura trinket careful  taliesin im going to try and wake cassandra up  matt okay  skype sounds  sam its the magic  laura thats magic  matt all right so you go ahead and check on her go ahead and makeactually this is pretty  easy you just go ahead and take a moment you just feel her for a pulse she is currently still  alive and with a flash of divine energy just past the outskirts of this antimagic field you can  see pikes radiant ethereal form all of a sudden /none/ reconstruct itself  laura and marisha pike  ashley im back  sam oh thank god  ashley we were killing lady briarwood  sam no were okay everythings okay thank sarenrae youre back  ashley okay can i heal somebody  sam we did that a bit while you were gone but yes  laura but im still pretty low if you feel like it i would take it and i would be grateful  ashley hows everybody else  travis can you heal a couple of people  ashley yeah  marisha im a little shaky  taliesin /none/ im a little shaky as well  laura pike heal us all we love you  ashley okay let me do a mass cure wounds i have that  liam gather together everyone gather together  marisha group hug  laura oh wait but wait dont let lady briarwood in the circle of healing  sam wait is she alive did you check her  matt she is currently alive shes unconscious and shes thankfully from the blast and the sheer  force of it part of the wound was cauterized but she has been bleeding quite a bit on /none/ the run down  here and she would probably need some sort of  marisha should i stabilize her  travis yeah wait stabilize her first  laura were away from the fucking sacrifice area maybe we should just kill her  taliesin i want to quickly check my gun is lord briarwoods name still on it  matt you go and inspect the barrel no sylas briarwood is currently erased from the barrel  taliesin lets hold off just a bit before we kill her  travis i have some really dirty rags could i do a medicine check /none/ and try and stabilize her  bleeding  matt if you want to  sam dirty rags  travis 18  sam do you have medicine skills  travis zero  matt so yeah as you guys are having this conversation grog comes over and pulls out a  mottled mass of really filthy rags from the bag of holding probably used in various nosewiping  circumstances  travis or other things  matt but somehow it manages to stop the bleeding and keep her relatively stable  for the moment yeah  travis okay and then i take her /none/ by the foot and i drag her on her face away from the group very  gently but still by her foot  matt okay  taliesin doublecheck perhaps gag her as well  travis oh right yeah she talks that shit doesnt she  taliesin we dont want her speaking and she only has one arm so magics going to be tricky  liam she cant do this kind of thing but she can still talk  matt pike did you say you wanted to cast mass cure wounds you said  ashley yes  matt okay you can /none/ choose up to six creatures in a 30foot radius so its your choice who you want  to heal  taliesin she cant see us why are we holding our hands up  laura i dont know  taliesin actually you can see us on the screen never mind  ashley i know i have you guys on my ipad down here but youre delayed  liam theres six including all of us  ashley okay so ill cure all the six people in my family  matt all right so thats 3d8 plus five for you  laura wow /none/  liam pour one out for your homies  marisha roll high  matt oh to have a cleric in the group again  travis i know right shit life  laura and marisha shes rolling  ashley 26  all ooh  laughter  matt oh let this be a lesson to all the people out there who think clerics are lame and nobody  loves them  travis we love them can i tear a piece of fabric off of one of the three remaining fancy robes and  i tie it around lady briarwoods mouth but like /none/ muffled in and you know like muffled in the  teeth all she cant really enunciate  matt okay so you pull it and you gag her around the side of her mouth and as you end up  tying it you see one of her eyes lulls open and she kind of coughs sputters  travis yelps shit shes awake  sam and laura punch her in the face  sam no wait dont youll kill her  matt up to you what do you want to do  sam blindfold her  travis i slap her  matt /none/ laughing roll a strength check  sam shit  laughter  sam hes going to kill her with a slap  laura shell be knocked unconscious and shell have to save three times again  travis 21  sam oh thats good  matt whack right across her face you hear a resounding crack sound as it appears some part of  her cheek bone probably is going to be fairly bruised tomorrow but she is straight to  unconsciousness again  cheering  travis if youre curious shes still alive  taliesin i can tell  laura she almost /none/ killed me  marisha is she just unconscious  matt shes still breathing  taliesin im going to try and wake up cassandra  matt okay  travis i did bandages on her real good  matt as youre standing in the tunnel theyre off to one side you go over to where cassandra  is you briefly set her down to have this conversation shes still bound on her arms and  legs she was nearly hogtied by grog when you guys finished up at the top of the temple shes  breathing you can see the dirt from /none/ being tossed to the ground is caked in on where the tear marks  are down her face you shake her gently and eventually she comes to consciousness and her eyes  roll around for a moment she glances over at you percy  taliesin we will have a discussion later in the meantime do you know what that thing in there is  and how do we stop it  matt i dont what whats going on  laura the spinning orb of death  matt she starts moving around looking around the tunnel real fast at everyone what /none/ happened  whats going on  travis you betrayed some bitches thats what you did  matt and as you say this you see she reacts as almost someone had just punched her in the chest  and the tears begin to flow down her face again and she im sorry  taliesin im going to slap her in the face  matt okay slap go ahead and roll a strength check  sam thats your sister percy  laura she might be unconscious too  taliesin not with my strength  travis jokingly natural 20  laughter  taliesin /none/ 16 well actually my strength is still thin because i still have a  sam oh negative two strength right  taliesin so 15  matt 15 yeah okay you smack her to get her attention in this circumstance she stops for a  second and gathers herself her breathing slows and she stares off into space for a moment  taliesin i need my sister back are you awake are you a terrible person do i want to strangle  you right now  matt probably  taliesin good then we can work with this they were building something /none/ down here the briarwoods  are no longer a problem they were building something what do you know about it it maybe  started it seems to be affecting magic i think  matt i dont know they wouldnt let me near it  laura dont lie to us anymore  matt im not lying do i have a reason to lie right now and she looks over at you with an  intensity to her gaze that catches you not as desperation but as passionate selfloathing  liam you seem to really believe your words but you know your /none/ word is worth fuck all right now  fuck all  matt i know i know she leans her head down on the side of this cavern wall and stares off into  space all that i know about this is that theyve been building it under the guidance of some other  person or entity they referred to him many times as the whispered one theyre very secretive about  it the only reason i knew was because i overheard a few conversations and questioned them about it to  which there was punishment but they mainly kept me /none/ to try and keep the people at bay my job was  to keep in contact with anyone who would attempt to rise against them and inform them i would  prevent any surprises although apparently chuckles and thankfully i didnt do a very good job  and she looks around the room at the rest of you  sam can i check my history memory banks to see if i know anything about the whispered one or if that  jogs any memory  matt roll a religion check mr bard  sam religion check well thats not good /none/ 20  laura what natural 20  sam no  laura damn it i had a really strong reaction to that  sam oh  travis yes the whispers  marisha hes whispering about the whispered one  sam hes gone where is he  travis this is the preshow days  liam its not new its just been a while  travis its been a long time  laura yeah but hes on this side of the table  taliesin none of us have rolled this well in so long  travis we used to play dont overlisten to /none/ it  taliesin starts singing in the hall of the mountain king  liam he is licking the inside of sams ear  laura look at his eyes  liam matthew is the whispered one  laura he is the whispered one this is normally the time when sam would  sam it was all tongue in my ear the whole time  laughter  sam it was so dirty  the whispered one i have a memory i dont know where i learned of this knowledge i am very  old but i did at some point in my /none/ travels i remember reading about something a lich king  matt a lich entity yeah  sam who wanted to be a god and his name was vecna and they called him the whispered one  thats all i remember he tried to achieve great power and i dont know if he was successful or  not  marisha oh boy  laura cassandra does any of that sound familiar  matt cassandra shakes her head and says honestly i didnt know anything beyond the name  i just knew they were very close with this individual  laura when /none/ you betrayed us you said you were serving a higher purpose did they plan to  sacrifice you to him  matt i know there was a blood ritual involved i did not know more than that there was to be a  gift of power should i give an element of my life to this ritual she shakes her head for a second  she blinks her eyes and she says i dont feel like i was right in my head i look back on so  many decisions ive made and all the people that ive the tears /none/ just start flowing again  liam insight check rolls ill take that 14  matt 14 best that you can read off her is there is a deep look of regret and sorrow in her  face and you do notice that through most of this conversation as much as shes been able to talk  to all of you she has been unable to make eye contact with percy  liam im going to walk over and plop down in front of her and say youve backed a losing  team and thats not surprising you having been through /none/ what youve been through thats all gone  now sylas is gone delilah is on deaths door whitestone needs to be tended to and protected do  you know anything that can help us save your birthright here and now  matt i mean youve already done half the job her eyes look over at the unconscious delilah in  the hallway  marisha cassandra is there any reason why theyd want to sacrifice you in particular  matt she thinks hard for a second her eyes squinting i dont they spoke very little  intentionally i think of what /none/ they wanted to do to be honest i think there was an element  that even they didnt know quite what they were doing i was a tool i was to be used i had my  purposes i did my best to fulfill them  travis ive got a question do you care if i smash the shit out of lady briarwoods head now  matt she glances over at her and with a stern look on her face she goes someone needs to  avenge my family and for the first time she looks over and makes eye /none/ contact with you you  feel a pulse in your hand like a heartbeat thoom the gun itself seems warmer and warmer  and you guys all notice as a bit of smoke begins to billow out the sides of percys sleeves you  hear a familiar voice creep up in the back of your head percival  taliesin i walk up to lady briarwood  matt here at your mercy  taliesin i put my gun to lady briarwoods head  sam wait percy youre going to shoot an unarmed woman  travis hush  sam dont shoot an /none/ unarmed woman  travis unarmed she tried to kill us  taliesin you changed the deal take her name off the gun  matt the deal was never changed  travis whos he talking to  matt the deal was made  taliesin i pull the gun away things have changed we need to talk  travis all right  sam whos he talking to  liam i hold up my hand and shush the group with my hand  matt you made a great sacrifice for my gifts percival do not let it be in vain  taliesin sighs /none/ did i even want revenge before i talked to you did i i dont remember anymore  what does she die for what do i even need i want my country i want my sister ive killed two of  those who have wronged me and nothing is better nothing feels better nothing is avenged what is  this worth to you and i put the gun back at her head  matt pull the trigger  travis i take out my hammer  taliesin pull it back put it to her put it back maybe i will  matt /none/ youre placing the gun against your own head  taliesin and back to hers  laura percival dont  matt percy no  percival dont do this we made a deal  taliesin i put the gun to the side no im holding the gun on briarwood that deal was a  soft deal it was a dream it was a vision  matt what are visions if not a window into the future you understand so little percival do not  make me regret sharing this with you  taliesin i need more from you if you want anything /none/ from me i dont trust you anymore  besides i put the gun to the hand of lady briarwood and pull the trigger the guns broken  anyway i drop it im not satisfied i want my money back  matt chuckles the smoke still billows out from you at this point  taliesin its actually also still around her it occurs to me  matt go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw  taliesin yep  marisha mumbles you have advantage  taliesin i have advantage thank you  matt you do  liam im not doing anything /none/ but im holding a dagger and just watching percy and aiming at  percy  taliesin yay 20  matt 20 you feel that warm pulse that was in your hand earlier that was coming from the gun it  pulses like a heartbeat in the hand that was holding it and for a second you feel like  something grabbed your wrist and slapped it away towards your back reaching for  where bad news is  taliesin which does work  matt and then you grunts rip control of your hand once again  taliesin delilah you are /none/ going to die tonight whether or not it is a merciful quick death or a  slow and agonizing one controlled by something darker than i know is entirely up to you how do  we stop that thing  matt delilah whose eyes are still rolling after all the shouting thats been going on as she comes  into consciousness with a gag around her mouth and goes breathes heavily struggling and her eyes  dart around in fear you can see that her makeup has run down her cheeks from her own lamenting  over sylass loss and /none/ the confusion over the ritual and the fear all of a sudden turns to  seething burning hatred as they dart around and then struggles again she cant talk  sam i will mage hand to remove the gag from her  laura oh god i pull an arrow and aim it right at her head  marisha yeah i prep my fire hands  taliesin i know the pain youre feeling right now i know the rage i know every moment of it  and i guarantee i can make it worse i can make it so much worse /dung/ fix this and join your beloved  matt as this is happening the gag falls away from her mouth from the magic hand shes glancing  at you and the smoke is now billowing up stronger to the point where you can barely see percys  torso you can see his head now and what little bit of a view you have his eyes have gone  completely dark there is just pitch black completely encasing the entirety of his visible  eye you can see his feet still dangling beneath the smoke and his feet are digging and tensed /none/  into the ground  taliesin delilah dont make me hurt you  marisha i reach over and i grab vexs hand and i look at her and i say what do we do  taliesin grog be ready to restrain me  travis im ready  laura percival frederickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii you will fight this  monster inside of you  matt delilah is looking at you right now and the anger and fury in her eyes clarified she just  looks up and youve already taken everything from me  taliesin i really havent /none/ you still have your sanity and your life i will take your life  tonight but i can leave you your sanity  matt interesting you seem to be struggling percy  taliesin okay im going to be an asshole fine fine casting minor illusion  matt okay  taliesin im changing my form into the screaming writhing slowlymelting visage of lord  briarwood  laura oh shit  taliesin and im just going to scream in holy high hell and pain  matt okay  taliesin suck it girl  matt so minor illusion as a limitation it wouldnt /none/ be a fullbody illusion but you can take  elements of your features  taliesin im in smoke im just taking  matt yeah where once percys face existed it twists into this shimmering apparition of sylas  briarwood looking down at her as his face contorts into horrible screaming pain the head rises up  and almost soundlessly he screams out as the flesh begins to melt from the bone as it does  percys voice rings out in this cacophonous roar that shakes the cavern around you  taliesin that pain youre feeling ive felt for years dont /none/ think ive imagined every way to hurt  you i could spend years hurting you before you die in ways you cannot imagine now how do we  stop it  matt i dont know i dont even know if it worked weve been preparing for this ritual  for five godforsaken years all to repay a debt and thats all you forced us  it was too soon  taliesin why why was it too soon what were you waiting for  matt we were waiting for a particular date there is a time each year in which the /none/ barriers  between realms grow and grow very weak you recall erevans attempt generations ago to blur between  the realm of ice and this one which you call the winters crest well this is too early and you  saw our failure he will not be happy i imagine and i still owe him for what he gave me for what  he gave us  laura what did he give you  matt at which point her eyes well up with tears and she looks over he gave me my sylas back and  you took him from /dung/ me again so do what you must do i know ive paid my penance and i know that  no matter what steps you take now it will only drag you deeper into this dark hole youve drawn  yourselves and you will hear me laughing  taliesin no i really wont knock her out again  travis oh fine punching sound  matt make a strength check  travis 19  matt 19 impact noise you hear clinking across some of the lower rocks as two of her teeth  go scattering out the side of her mouth  /none/ taliesin collect them  travis theyre not pointy right  matt no  taliesin check her person for anything  laura oh i will gladly do that for you  travis hold on a second are you sure you dont want to smoke this bitch  laura i check her person for anything valuable  taliesin i think were just going to throw her into the acid pits  no i dont feel  liam whats the plan here percy  sam i pick up the pepperbox off the floor to give it to him and i try to sneak /none/ out a bullet  taliesin theyre different bullets  sam i dont know that  matt okay make a sleight of hand check  sam three  travis shit  sam plus two plus two  matt so five giggles  taliesin the three in theory is actually low enough to break it further  matt make a perception check  marisha plus two its five  taliesin fine  liam natural one  taliesin nope thats a 16  matt so you watch as scanlan looks around grabs it picks it up and clink the full barrel comes  /none/ off of the gun  sam i back away from it  laura you guys hes got smoke billowing out of him right now  sam kick it off away to the corner  taliesin scanlan give me the other gun  sam oh its on the floor right there  taliesin the other gun  sam you were talking to something out there what was it i was very scared im a little man  travis just change the subject  sam who were you talking to  taliesin i need another gun  sam are you going to /none/ kill me with it  laughter  taliesin maybe  liam i walk between them and say percy what are we doing here that woman deserves everything  that is brought upon her but what are we doing for whitestone what are we doing  marisha more importantly what was that just now who were you talking to  taliesin i dont know  marisha what  taliesin things have gotten a bit weird  marisha percy you cannot honestly tell us you dont know anymore we just watched you have a  fullfledged conversation with yourself  taliesin did /none/ they not hear any of the voice  liam yeah was he talking out loud  taliesin oh shit i came off like a crazy person just then  travis you did yes you did  sam heres what i know  travis we were trying to answer you for a little bit  sam heres what i know vecna is possibly maybe on the loose maybe coming back we know that this  ritual has been started and we dont know whether killing her is going to end it or not so i  propose that we start leaving /none/ right away  laura pike do you know anything about vecna  marisha anything further  matt pike you go ahead and make a religion check  sam matt fly to new york to whisper in her ear  laughter  matt its tempting  marisha yeah just text her  liam 47  ashley 17  matt 17 okay not a whole lot more information than what scanlan was able to ascertain from  this you just know that this entity known as vecna once a very powerful archlich had once  attempted to ascend to godhood and was /none/ supposedly halted in the process a battle that occurred on  another plane amongst heroes that only a few came back from but apparently stopped a very terrible  thing but that was hundreds and hundreds of years ago  marisha i wonder what erevan has to do with this  laura and he created a vampire he made sylas a vampire  matt you do know that sorry  marisha go ahead  matt you do know and pike relays this too in particular vecna is known as for lack of a  better term the patron saint or /dung/ lesser god to those who worship as the deity of secrets dark  secrets things that wish to be kept out of the knowledge of most of the world at large and  these secrets are coveted  ashley jeez  taliesin things are complex and i dont trust myself to take her life im in over my head  laura do you need someone else to do it for you  taliesin i dont know if that will help  travis she almost killed vex she didnt kill vax weve got to do fucking something with her  taliesin /none/ this thing wants her dead and the only thing i can think to do is to say no  liam this thing what thing  taliesin this thing in my head  laura your thing  liam what thing is that percival  taliesin i dont know  liam well start fucking talking percival because weve all watched you talk to yourself for  five straight minutes and were not going to deal with it for much longer  marisha sorry percy im with vax here  taliesin i had a dream and that was all  marisha you mentioned /none/ just now that you wanted your money back was this a dream did you pay  somebody and with what  taliesin it was a dream where i was offered a means to revenge it was a dream  marisha well clearly it wasnt  taliesin well i know that now  liam percival  taliesin this is as new to me as anyone  liam it feels like you are lying to us  marisha can i do an insight check on him  taliesin please  laura laughs let me know if im lying because  marisha fucking /none/ fuck  taliesin why do you all keep rolling so poorly against me  marisha 16  matt taliesin tell me what your persuasion and deception skills are  taliesin persuasion six deception two  laura 23 ooh two in one  travis you got a whisper  matt interparty insight  marisha we have to title this whispers  travis whispers  taliesin i think weve already had an episode called whispers  sam well this ones called secrets and lies  liam this ones called whispersync  taliesin eartonguing  sam this ones called just whisper noises  /none/ travis for the record i like the shadow stuff  marisha squeals i get one too  sam he whispers to you all the time  laughter  laura it looks like there was more tongue with you though sam  matt way to point that out  travis didnt get sufficient tongue in yours  taliesin you dont seem very satisfied  sam remember these shirts are available online at geekandsundrycom  laura i knew you were going to do that i almost did it when he was whispering in your ear just  for your sake  matt /none/ i would also like you to make another wisdom saving throw  sam oh shit  taliesin natural 20  travis yelling shut the fuck up  taliesin breaking the game  travis what the what  matt at this point you feel your hands tense up and once again begin to reach towards your back you  close your eyes and with all your will and might you just scream no instinctively it wasnt  even a conscious thought it was just an animalistic response to feeling your physical form  being taken over and in that moment every /none/ muscle in your body tenses  and you guys watch the smoke momentarily drift from his form behind him  laura behind him  travis off of him  sam you dont need to yell at us percy were just trying to help you  travis the smoke dissipates or goes behind him  sam i dont think hes rational  matt behind him  liam im aiming at the smoke and just watching and waiting  matt at this point you can see this smoke that was once billowing from percy is now standing in  this outer humanlike /none/ shape  sam unbeamsay  marisha cashed outsay  matt as it stands there for a moment it begins to swell and grow larger filling almost the  height of the tenfoot tunnel that you guys are standing in looming over percys body still  connected through his shadow through the floor of the tunnel itself it just looms over and as it  peeks forward you guys for the first time hear the voice thats been poking through him this  entire time just say percival do it  laura i shoot a holy arrow at it  matt /none/ then lets roll some initiative  yelling  marisha were fighting the thing thats been in your head  taliesin therapy  marisha theres so many allegories  taliesin therapy  marisha were fighting the demons in your head  matt laughs thats pretty great actually  taliesin my therapist would be so proud right now  laura oh

pretty low on spells guys but were going to be okay  taliesin i have been dreading this for years  liam what what have you been dreading  taliesin this moment right now  laura oh my god this has been in him for three years four years  marisha forever since /none/ the beginning  taliesin since youve met me  travis ive been standing in front of lady briarwood  matt yeah so right there with her  taliesin im either going to be a new percy or a new person entirely  laura no dont say that  taliesin im so sorry its so fun to torture you  sam as everyones drawing their weapons i shout maybe we should check and make sure it wont kill  him if we kill it  laura its too late i shot an arrow at it  matt its too late whos /dung/ standing where im going to say pikes probably  taliesin you have a little cavern for this  liam wheres percy  matt percy is currently right here well more in the center there talking to everybody  taliesin do you have a mini for the dark specter of my soul i love you  i love you so much  matt with cassandra on the ground there  liam im next to vex  matt right so you guys would be probably back here your daggers ready trinket is probably over  by you of course  laura yeah /none/ of course he is  matt and keyleth id say youre probably on this side talking to percy  laura oh wait but we were holding hands at one point so we would be close  taliesin and grog was covering me so grog wouldve been closer to me because i had him  travis yeah i was in front of lady briarwood though  matt i have you right here between him and lady briarwood right there  laura that seems good were good  liam do i have a clear shot not that im going to do it /none/ but i was aiming at percy so i would  have a clear line of sight is there nothing between us  matt you would have a clear line of sight the two gnomes are between you so youre fine  taliesin i am so happy right now  laura how did my holy arrow do  matt were going to find out in just a second so first and foremost initiative order we have  25 to 20  laura 25  matt wow okay so we have vex  sam 20  matt two 20s 19 to 15 /none/  liam 19  matt 19  marisha 16  matt 16 okay  marisha i didnt suck it up this game  matt 15 to ten  travis 17  matt 17 oh 17 all right  travis oh sorry did i miss that section  matt you did thats okay pike what did you get  ashley eight  matt eight yeah all right first and foremost vex youre up with the initiative on this you go  ahead and you bring your holy arrow and you release it  laura is it a surprise attack  matt /none/ technically no it knew you were there it was very aware of everyones position and was  essentially after being forced out of his body at the moment preparing itself for some sort of  assault so not a surprise round unfortunately so go ahead and make your attacks with your  arrows if youd like  laura yes 28 and 27  matt both of those hit  laura awesome okay these two balls so 15 16 17 plus holy damage  matt ill consider that do 1d4 radiant damage to it in addition to that so 17 plus /none/  laura 17 plus four is 21  matt 21 for the first one  laura and then ten for the second  matt all right so  laura and then i hunters mark him  matt all righty  laura i didnt say i hunters marked him at the beginning im explaining this to you guys  because id already said i shot at him  matt you did  laura so i was being honest im looking at the chat room because i know theyre going to tell me  i forgot my damn hunters mark  matt /none/ thats okay all right you pull back and release the first arrow as it goes and hits you  can see the smoke itself is obscuring its place and keeping it hard to hit but you still strike  true the arrow striking into its form and theres a flash of radiant energy as it hits and  you see the creature takes from the impact and stares down at its chest as it looks up its face  turning towards you and it is this formless humanoid body but the face itself does pinch into  this elongated crow /none/ skull  laura ooh i didnt do holy damage for the second one  sam did the arrows hit  laura yeah plus two more for the holy damage  sam they impacted  matt they impacted  sam okay  matt all right takes both the hits and looks over at you and you can see as it turns the head  you can see better even in this low light the shape of its face and its eyes burst into this  angry burning purplish energy expression and it looks very unhappy with the current circumstance  do /none/ you want to move you or trinket  laura trinket moves around and in front of me to protect me  matt okay there you go thats it youre just going to keep there  laura yeah  matt all right that ends your turn scanlan youre up next  sam how tall is the tunnel  matt its about 12 feet  sam okay no okay precious little i can do i will lightning bolt it ooh  im right next to it  matt you are which means you could blast towards the wall and hit it  /none/ sam all right i will turn around and i will i will lightning bolt it yes  matt okay all right so you its right there in front of you as the smoke rises up and you see  the arrows strike it theres the flash of holy energy from vexs attack and that moment as its  distracted you use that to conjure a lightning bolt and lightning sound for a moment the  flashing of light lights up the cavern around the bolt passes through it harmlessly  marisha what what did you what was that  sam /none/ lightning  laura either or magic one of the two didnt affect it  matt the lightning bolt passes through it and it strikes the back of the wall and you can see the  electrical energy discharge across the stone and earth arcing and spidering off until it  dissipates seeming to not have any sort of impact or effect on the billowing smoke entity  sam shit  matt you want to stay there or you want to move you are in its melee range you are in its melee  range so if you move it will /none/ get an attack of opportunity if it chooses to take it  sam stammers i will not move and instead i will inspire percy  matt okay  sam and ill say you feel good in this motherfucker your whole hood in this  motherfucker laughs thats it  laughter  matt all right take your d10 this moment of intensity as you turn around now at this point  seeing everyone striking youve looked your head over and you can see for the first time in full  physical form the creature that has haunted your dreams for the /none/ past five years while it is not  present you can feel it smile its your turn  taliesin im going to run over to my sister  matt okay  taliesin and cut open her bonds  matt okay so you pull out the okay  taliesin take out my sword and cut open her bonds get back run and then if i still have  enough timing beyond that id love to take a swipe at it with my sword  matt unfortunately its going to to free her entirely of her bonds and give her that its /none/  going to be your action  taliesin okay we havent had a short rest have we  matt laura and marisha no  matt i know  marisha were not looking good  matt all right it is now vaxs turn  liam oh good so ive got advantage because the smoke demon hasnt gone yet so dagger and a  dagger first one is thats 29 and the second one is a 24 so 29 and 24  matt whats giving you advantage on this because he hasnt gone first in the first round that is  correct /none/ yes all right so both of those hit  liam the first one is eight and the second one is eight  matt okay  liam keen dagger lifestealing  matt right do you want to sneak attack with this because in theory its in melee range with  an ally  liam oh with percy  matt with percy and with scanlan  liam thanks boss yeah  matt dont rob yourself of what you do  taliesin matts understanding that we are all screwed  liam seven eight nine its hard to see over there 15 points of /none/ sneak attack damage yeah im  not used to the screen  matt were working out the bugs its a process were working on it all right cool 15 points of  sneak attack damage so as you throw the two daggers plunging them both both of them their  little aura of magical energy flashing as they both impact the smoke form seeming to sink slowly  as they hit and then finding the edge of their blades sunken into its torso as it rears back  liam eight and eight and 15  matt correct all right  /none/ marisha so the daggers did it  matt cool that are you going to stay where you are vax  liam yeah i am  matt all right now it is the entitys turn as it rears and the daggers both vanish from its  torso returning to your belt side it is glaring down at you to its side and it says percival  dont make orthax regret working with you  sam orthax  marisha and taliesin orthax  sam i hired them to get rid of some termites in my house once  taliesin well that was /none/ really your mistake then  matt shifting this way twice percy you will get an attack of opportunity with  your rapier if youd like  taliesin ill take it  matt all right  travis youre using briarwoods rapier  taliesin no i havent no short rest  travis right  taliesin 25  matt 25 hits go ahead and roll damage  taliesin nine points  matt nine points of damage all right good to know  taliesin all right yeah  matt now on the rest of its turn as it shifts up it doesnt walk or /dung/ move its form drifts along  and the shadows meet it there the smoke almost appears at the spot where it intends to go and  then it meets it in that moment as it does it now stands between a bunch of you its eyes flare  with dark purple and you just hear this scream this screeching scream echo out from it and as  it does all of you hold your ears for a second i need everyone to make a wisdom saving throw you  have advantage  laura we have advantage  taliesin 21  /none/ marisha with the ten 23  sam natural 20 on the first roll  liam 16  laura 22  travis 16  laura 18 for pike  matt okay so all of you guys hold your ears for a second and everyone that rolled higher than a  17 takes six points of psychic damage  marisha psychic damage  matt correct you guys both take 13 points of psychic damage  taliesin 13 because hes evil  matt both of you feel all of a sudden like your brain fill with this urge to strike something  this /none/ overwhelming need to slash out at whatevers near you both of you get a brief move grog  thats going to pull you this way and vax its going to pull you this way  liam right at each other  matt i need both of you guys to roll an attack roll as you rush up with your hammer flames and  you swing it down towards scanlan  laura scanlan  travis dont dap me for hitting scanlan  sam im going to use cutting words to try to dodge out of the way  matt okay roll /none/ the attack  travis oh shit 19  matt okay so 19  sam im going to say you gonna fail that attack so you better sit your ass on back  because i aint no hollaback gnome i aint no hollaback gnome  matt all right roll a d10  sam d10 three so that what does that do  matt all right so cutting words if i recall  sam it lowers his attack by three  matt right so that brings it from 19 to 16 whats your armor class  sam its 17  matt with /none/ that the bards words ring true to your mind and for a second you feel this new  this not grogbased rage this outside forceful rage that it confuses you and as he says that  youre right he is no hollaback gnome  laughter  matt and you resist with the hammer giving him just enough time to step out of the way and it  slams into the ground harmlessly cracking the stone at the base  travis you know what youre right he is no hollaback gnome  matt vax id like you to go ahead and /dung/ make a dagger strike against pike  liam i rolled a 13  matt rolled a 13 pike you look over your shoulder as all of a sudden vax appears behind you  and slams forward with the dagger you whip around with your shield and with a large striking arc of  sparks deflect the blade blow across the dark air of this interior tunnel harmlessly you take no  damage  laura badass pike  taliesin she also aint no hollaback gnome  marisha aint no hollaback gnome  taliesin aint no hollaback gnome  ashley aint no /none/ hollaback gnome  matt and with that you know what its going to go ahead and do this the entity then moves  backwards pike and scanlan oh you already used your reaction to do cutting words so you dont  get that pike go ahead and make a melee attack  sam damn it thats a reaction  ashley what do i roll for that again  matt one reaction per round  laura your d20  matt just roll a d20 roll for your normal mace attack  ashley 17  matt 17 unfortunately does not hit it /none/ seems like it shouldve but the smoke is obscuring the  vision around it and where you swing you do not manage to get quite close enough to hit its body  as it steps backward into the wall and out of visual range  marisha what  laura what  sam into the wall  matt into the wall it just vanishes into the side of the tunnel that brings us to grog  liam the cloud went in the wall  matt yeah  travis i would like to rage  matt okay  travis and move in /none/ front of the rest of the group i put my back to the rest of the group  matt okay so like right there  travis yeah  matt okay  sam what the fuck grog you just tried to kill me  travis i did  sam yes  travis i dont remember that  sam are you okay  travis yeah  matt if you want to you can hold you can use your action to ready an attack so whenever a  trigger of your choosing happens you can then make your attack  travis i would /none/ like to do that  matt okay what trigger would you like  travis when he reappears  matt okay and comes within melee range  travis yeah when i can see him with my beautiful eyes  matt okay so youre holding your action there good to know keyleth youre up  marisha okay not trusting this guy im going to go ahead and cast faerie fire its a 20foot  radius just right in this bubble that weve been hanging out in  matt okay  marisha because im assuming hes going to be up in our faces /none/  matt all righty faerie fire where do you want it just in this vicinity  marisha yeah just right right around us  matt okay so 20foot radius so well say probably in the back here and forward this way so  this area between these so as keyleth you put your arms up and this burst of glowing luminescent  pinkishpurple energy begins to sparkle through the air like glitter suspended in low gravity and  it drifts through the air in the entire vicinity you can see it clinging to you guys a little bit  all /none/ right are you going to move or you going to stay where you are  marisha ill step back a bit  matt step out of the faerie fire or into it  marisha step out of it  matt okay am i  marisha thats good  matt just ten feet okay ending your turn keyleth pike youre up  ashley okay is guiding bolt considered the same thing that lightning bolt would be  matt no as far as you know  liam radiant damage  matt yeah its radiant damage and let me pull up the  /none/ travis we cant see him right now though  matt yeah you have no visual on him the smoke entity has moved into the wall and is nowhere in  your visible range right now so you have nothing that you can attack in theory that you know of  ashley okay  matt if you have any buff spells anything you want to do in preparation for it or hold your  action as well until it reappears you can do that  ashley okay ill hold my action  matt okay  ashley yeah  matt are

out to everybody the thing seems to want percy  should we surround him  liam yes  matt so you shout that out at the end of that cassandra now who has been unbound gets up her  weapons were taken from her when you bound her so she stands up and puts herself /none/ to the wall and  looks at you with a  taliesin i hand her my sword  matt okay she takes the rapier and looks at it and goes running away back towards where castle  whitestone is  taliesin yeah  travis she runs  ashley can i do something  matt if you want to instead of holding your action cast something you can do that  ashley yeah im going to go up to percy and cast protection from evil on him  taliesin whoa  ashley which  matt what are you going to choose /none/ you get to choose a certain type of creature which hes  protected against  taliesin do we know anything about orthax  matt you have no idea you saw it briefly im going to have you roll a religion check being a  religiously trained individual lets see if you can ascertain the nature of this creature this  entity  ashley 22  matt 22 okay in the brief moment you got to see it the way it moves the way it completely cast  aside scanlans attack and the way that it housed itself within percy for /none/ so long there are  elements of it that make you think of a shadow demon but usually theyre not this large  theyre not this powerful either this is just a powerful entity of a similar type or its been  feeding over time or its something beyond that but you get the sense that this thing is demonic  in nature based on the brief appearance you had with it  ashley okay id like to protect him from shadow demons  matt okay so that would be fiends so you choose fiends great so any attack rolls /none/ against you  from fiend creatures have disadvantage  laura hes a demon  matt shes thinking he might be based on her roll  laura i have favored enemy as demons  matt then knowing that going forward that may change your next round of combat good to know so  you are currently are protected from fiends  taliesin if only that were true in real life  matt vex youre up first  laura oh so demons are my favored enemy so i have advantage against recalling information about  them can i recall anything about something /dung/ that looks like this  marisha orthax  matt make an intelligence check just roll a d20 and add your intelligence and you have advantage  on it because hes your favored  laura im not that smart 12  matt 12 okay you know that these creatures are incorporeal they can generally shift in and out  of solid matter as a way of moving and defending itself you know that theyre difficult to fight  in the dark you also know that they because of their form are generally resistant to a lot of  types of elementaltype /none/ damage and lighting and cold no effect whatsoever  laura got it  matt as well as poison  laura good to know  matt thats as much as you can ascertain with that roll  laura okay all right then im going to cast where is he shouting hes in the fucking wall  sam just hit the whole wall  laura hunters mark can i sense anything about where he is  matt yeah you can actually sense him hes maybe ten feet inside the wall  laura so hes hiding  matt hes currently hiding in the /none/ wall yeah  laura all right then for my bonus action im going to hide as well  matt okay go ahead and roll a stealth check  liam advantage  matt yeah  laura really  liam i didnt roll it the cape had nothing to do with your rolls  matt what  liam three and a three  laura well hold on let me add my stealth to it  sam thats a 33  laura thats a 12  matt okay good to know so you wind noise flatten yourself against the wall best of your /dung/  ability  laura i do pretty much nothing and im going to hold my turn until he appears  matt okay so youre going to hold your action until he appears  marisha how dark is it in here  matt other than the torches you guys have been carrying through here  sam and the glowing off of our bodies  matt yes  laura oh right im glowing no wonder i rolled so poorly  matt glowing from the faerie fire but its a gentle glow so its very low light in this area  taliesin like /tavern/ inside of groot gentle glow  marisha its like we have body glitter on  laura its beautiful  matt yeah its like a nice basement bar a good dive  sam get this shit off me  matt laughs ending your turn scanlan youre up  sam i say to keyleth get this shit off me i dont want it to see me please and then i will  walk to the other side of percy we dont see the thing right  matt no  marisha you can just move out of the faerie fire its only a /none/ 20foot radius  sam no but isnt it on me now  marisha no its a radius if you move out of it youre not in it  sam i walk out of it  matt all right you step out of the area and it all drifts off your body and youre no longer  affected by the spell  sam we dont see the thing right yeah theres not much we can do without  seeing our enemy right  matt not currently no  sam ill just hold my turn is that a thing can i do /none/ that  matt yeah you can do that  sam i can say to grog grog youre sure you want to are you okay youre good  travis yeah  sam all right  matt all right ends your turn percy youre up  taliesin im going to back out of the faerie fire  matt youre just stepping out of it there you can keep going if you want  taliesin im going to go a little further back behind scanlan and im going to pull out bad news  and hold my turn  matt okay ending your /none/ turn vax youre up  liam yeah im going to practice an old trick that my sister and i have done where i hide  behind trinkets gigantic bear ass and hold my turn and aim at the spot that  my sister is aiming at  matt all right good to know  taliesin ditto  matt all right at that moment as you vanish to the side the entity pops out from this side  laura right behind him  matt right behind you as youre preparing and all of a sudden whoosh smoke billows out you  /none/ turn out of the corner of your head at that point everyone who was holding your action  youre doing your attacks simultaneously  laura whoa  marisha and hes in that faerie fire right  matt he is currently yeah  marisha so you get advantage yo  matt he didnt see it being cast he withdrew before it happened so he steps right into it  taliesin all right starting with bad news with a sharpshooter  laura we get advantage on attacking him  matt yeah all of your attacks on him currently have advantage  taliesin /dung/ thank god because i rolled a one 14  matt 14 unfortunately misses you fire and ricochet noise it seems that in a strange way  the gentle pink dust is actually obscuring your vision with the dark shadow in that vicinity and  it blasts a piece of rock off the side of the wall  taliesin firing again  matt so fire reload  taliesin better 26  matt 26 does hit go ahead and roll damage  taliesin thats thats pizza im looking for my dice i didnt think this through 25 points of  damage  /none/ matt all right good to know this is piercing right  taliesin yeah  matt all right the blast hits but it appears that the expected impact from the blast of bad  news a bit of smoke dissipates its impact and it seems to not be as damaging as you expected it to  be all right that brings us to the next person who was holding their action i believe scanlan  you were what do you want to do  sam theres precious little i can do so i will viciously mock it  laughter  matt /none/ good  sam through the hand cone i will say dont you know smoking is the number one cause of cancer and  emphysema and will shorten your life by an estimated ten to 20 years its not cool and you  shouldnt do it  taliesin is that all true  sam im bsing  taliesin oh okay  matt okay it does not make its saving throw it rolled a four so it takes 3d4 psychic damage go  ahead and roll that and it has disadvantage on its next attack roll  liam that fiend has low /none/ selfesteem  sam five points  matt five points of damage boom  sam and it has disadvantage on what  matt on its next attack roll its eyes go darker purple for a second like it cant contemplate the  fact that it just got insulted midbattle and then they flare up again even more furious as  part of that its going to use its reaction  sam oh shit okay  matt it turns towards you and in what languages do you speak  sam gnome common thats it  laughter  matt you hear a muttering /none/ through your ears mutters in foreign language and for a second  you feel your field of vision close down like its focused entirely on you youre currently marked  by its mark of vengeance  sam marked  matt yeah so essentially theres an effect thats intent on you at the moment  sam is it a charm effect  matt nope  sam damn it  matt all right that ends your held actions  sam is it a fear effect  matt no  sam damn it  matt youre up  liam yeah i just saw /none/ him mutter in scanlans ear as i take both of my blades and im just going to  slash both of them across and hes surrounded so this is a sneak attack as well  matt yes  liam with advantage the first one  liam and laura groan  liam is 16 oh no and the second one is a 27  matt second one hits  liam all right  matt you go to strike the first time and as you swing outward you catch smoke and it dissipates  around the blade and you stab into the /none/ side of the wall  liam okay  matt second attack impact noise  liam here comes that sneak attack damage thats four plus six is ten plus sneak attack  motherfucker ten 16 21 22 26 28 29 total  laura that was 38  liam huh  laura just kidding  liam and laura 29 total  laura singing my math is awesome  matt okay this blade however as you stab into this cloud of smoke you feel there is more  physical presence to where it was and it sinks in and you feel this reverberation /none/ as it reacts to  the pain this dull hoarse growl growl sound  liam i shout hands off the gnome as i do it  matt okay  sam on my roll do i still get a bonus  matt you used it last turn that was his reaction to you holding your action  sam no but do i get my bonus action as part of my move or no  matt that would have had to be during your turn when you hold your action you just get the action  when it triggers  sam got /none/ it  matt all right so that ends vax do you want to do anything else  liam no oh im right up against it im going to use disengage and back up further back by my  sister is that vex and keyleth  matt right there yeah  liam im going to move between my two favorite ladies  matt all right there you go good to know and you were holding your action  laura yes  matt and you were holding your action  travis yeah  matt so everyone make your attacks  laura yes /none/ heres my question  matt yes  laura because i want to be honest and i dont remember if i said i dipped arrows in the second  holy oil flask or if i put them on trinkets claws do we remember  matt you did all arrows  laura thats fine then im going to shoot two more holy arrows at him  okay well ill roll for that  marisha with advantage  laura with advantage which is good im going to switch things new ones gasps what just  happened  liam well one of those was /none/ a 14 so that hit theres 14 and eight 14 plus your attack the  second roll she got a one and a two so  laura seriously so one was a 25 and then 17  matt 17 misses unfortunately  laura i mean 19 19 and a 25  matt whats the 19 from  laura was the first roll and the second  matt right so you rolled a one and a two  liam no that was the second roll the first was an eight and a 14 plus her modifiers  laura oh see i /none/ was rolling i understand i was rolling it in my head differently but well  count it as that i was counting it as that was my first attempts at my first two attacks and my  second attempts at my first two attacks  matt yeah it doesnt work that way  laura yeah okay thats fine so 25  matt okay so one of them hit all right so you go ahead and roll damage on that  laura i wont roll like that anymore where am i thats radiant damage and thats that here we go  /none/ all right  liam oh jeez weve got a smoke demon dontcha know  laura 17 plus five is  liam 24  laura 24 points  matt 24 points of damage so one of them flies forward and misses  laura 22  matt yeah nearly grazes the top of your head just vanishing you dont notice because youre  currently growls right in his face second one manages to strike it and splinter inside of its  torso and you can see a flash of energy from the impact and it squawking groan growl surveys the  area /none/ around it the smoke around it gets even more intense and you can see it flaring up  laura im still against the wall glowing  matt yeah so the smoke gets even thicker and obscures it even further  laura we should probably light up this area as much as possible fyi  matt and grog  travis im going to light it up with my flaming war hammer i turn and i swing at it  matt okay  marisha so metal  travis hey thats good 28  matt 28 hits second attack  travis 26  /none/ matt 26 hits  travis nice oh is it still covered in the holy oil  matt yes so an extra 1d4 radiant damage on each strike  travis 21 for the first one  matt okay  travis with the radiant fiery damage  matt burning holy wrath  travis fuck yes 19 20 21 22  matt 22 all righty impact sounds both hammer blows strike it battering the smoke around and  you can see as this hammer swings through its body the smoke almost swallows the light and for  a second its almost like this /none/ dull orb of darkness beneath the surface of a deep lake and  then as the hammer emerges from its body the light flares up again its almost like its  swallowing the light as you strike it but it seems to be taking the impacts pretty hard all  right that ends your turn now orthax can take his turn  laura oh no  matt all right so lets see  ashley wait do i get my  matt thats right you were holding too yeah you can do it too thank you for reminding me  laura /none/ yay pike  ashley okay im going to guiding bolt it  matt all right go for it  liam your punishment will be more severe  laughter  ashley all right so 4d6  matt what level of guiding bolt are you doing  ashley say one more time  matt what level of guiding bolt are you casting  ashley im going to do it at 4th because i have a couple of 4thlevel left  matt okay so that will be chuckles roll to attack first you have advantage on the attack  roll because its currently /none/ inside faerie fire so take the higher of the two rolls  liam i would just like to say that pike is very eerie yet beautiful in this iridescent glow of  astral projection its hard to hear her sometimes but god damn it  she makes it look good  ashley oh oh my god i rolled a one and a natural 20  cheering  ashley what  matt okay so at 4th level that would be 7d6 radiant damage  laura and marisha whoa  marisha wait what did you cast  laura and travis guiding bolt /none/  marisha oh fuck yeah  taliesin 7d6  matt yeah  sam thats a lot of d6  taliesin times two  laura is it times two after that because its a crit  marisha its a crit oh right because thats well its straight dice rolls or does she roll  dice twice  matt for the purpose of ease i usually double im just confirming one thing real fast  liam she has just blinded us all in holy light is what im assuming  matt yeah so go ahead and do your math  marisha little /none/ holy nuke  sam thats my pike  ashley okay  laura what was it pike  ashley 21  laura 21  matt 21 all right  laura times two  marisha times two right  laura please  matt yep so that would be times two just confirming it has been a while since weve had  any sort of spellbased crit so that would be 42 points of radiant damage  laura ashley and marisha whoa  matt as you release this bolt of energy out of your hand you see it charges up and fills up /none/ your  hand shaking as youre waiting for the moment where it might be too much to control and your  holy symbol flares as it releases and streaks forward right behind you you were technically in  melee with it which would have given you disadvantage on the attack but you had advantage  on him because of that and well say its fine it stays there because there were a lot of things  giving advantage against him and then disadvantage well stay with it as you turn  around you release it point blank it slams into /none/ the front and you can see where the smoke was  swelling around it it almost seems to be scattered away from the impact of this radiant  bolt and for a second this image of this obscured shadowy humanoid becomes very clear and  you can see this extremely muscular humanoid torso with elongated exaggerated arms and fingers  seemingly featureless across its body other than its black obsidian torso no legs they disappear  into the smoke beneath it its head has the long hooked birdlike skull beak and where the eyes  are its just this smooth /dung/ almost leathery texture across the dark body itself you can see  what looks like faint horns that curve around the back that curl upward and as it takes the  impact its head rolls back and you can hear this billowing scream moaning cry as it leans back  forward towards you it looks like its having a rough moment now we get to its turn  laura oh no  matt all right  travis it farts a little cloud of smoke  taliesin a lot of us are outside the faerie fire  matt based on that /none/ it zeroes down on the little ball of radiant energy staring before it that just  blasted a hole in its form its going to take all three of its strikes at you pike  taliesin its got disadvantage on its attacks  matt and has advantage because shes in faerie fire so it cancels it to a natural attack that  is 21 whats your ac  ashley 20  matt 20 so that hits 27 and a natural one  marisha oh  matt it was like 19 one  ashley laughs  matt all right so that /none/ would be 14 points of psychic damage  ashley okay  matt oh no im sorry because of the roll there thats 14 plus an additional 12 so thats  16 for the first strike  sam quietly 12 thats 26  matt right it was 12 on top of the original amount which i said was 16  sam 14  taliesin 14 and then 12  matt 14 and 12 yeah so it was 26 psychic damage you took on the first strike and the second one  was seven too 21  ashley i thought the second /none/ one failed  matt the third one it has three attacks  ashley oh theres three  matt yeah  ashley okay so what was the total sorry  matt it would be 26 and 21 so yeah 47 points of psychic damage as its arm reaches out towards you  and strikes also i need you to make a wisdom saving throw  taliesin with advantage  matt with advantage  sam and with beauty  taliesin grace dignity  liam skype  ashley okay 20  matt youre doing your hunters mark damage  laura oh yeah i /none/ did  matt so what was that  liam 20  ashley 20  matt 20 yeah you feel as its claws move through your body elements of its shadow essence reach up  and try to grasp an element of your willpower you shrug it off the might of sarenrae is too strong  and it has no way of grasping your intent  travis yeah it is  ashley yeah get out of here  matt unfortunately that used all of its movement it cannot withdraw into the room that  will be the end of its turn /none/ lets see if that recharges oh it does okay  that brings us to grog  travis it does  matt yep youre back up to your turn now  travis grunts i want to hit it again  matt go for it  travis do i have advantage  marisha yes  travis faerie fire thats better 24  matt okay  travis the second one is 21  matt hits  travis nice  matt just barely  travis first one is 15  matt okay  travis 18  matt 18 okay you hit the side of /none/ its body and you can see now small cracks in its black form  are starting to form and you can see a bit of that purplish energy leaking out its starting to  actually visibly show a difficulty in keeping its corporeal form as both blows slam into it you  can see it shaking and there is a struggle to its movement do you want to stay where you are or do  you want to move  travis ill stay where i am  matt okay keyleth  marisha hes totally surrounded pretty much right  matt /none/ essentially  marisha yeah im actually going to throw up im going to maintain my faerie fire  sam youre going to throw up  marisha im going to yes  taliesin and marisha retching noises  laughter  marisha dryheaving noises its purple  sam i

take a daylight beam and go bing right over /none/ top of it like a nice pretty  spotlight  matt okay  travis ah  matt all right which that is a concentration spell  marisha its not actually its an action that lasts for an hour  matt interesting i would assume that was  marisha i looked it up just now  matt this little spark ball of daylight opens up on the ceiling like a bright spotlight that fills  the area as it does you can see the creature howling groan shrinks away from it and its  smoke actually dissipates lowering its armor class /none/ again  sam oh thats a good move  matt all right are you going to stay where you are or are you going to move  marisha ill take another step back  matt okay  marisha thats good  matt all right with that okay theres a momentary whisper in the shadow around you and  the sound of chains i want everyone to make a perception check  marisha what  taliesin damn  travis so close  taliesin 26  matt 26  travis 19  laura 20  liam 20  sam 17  marisha

staying in its body what was once this amorphous smoke after the impacts from grog and as it  begins to wear itself down its starting to find it harder and harder to keep this ethereal form  so now these arrows are sticking out of these cracks of purplish glowing energy and its moving  a little more sluggishly  /none/ laura i hide again for my bonus  matt okay make a stealth check scanlan youre

of the center of her back  liam for a second  laura and then its gone  matt and then it disappears and blood begins to pour out from the wound  sam shes dead you killed her  matt all right  taliesin

this giant hammer with his eyes clouded in  the same black smoke material you bring up your shield and as the hammer comes down striking at  you you know theres a bruise going to be on your forearm tomorrow because the sheer force of it  hits you but at the same time you know its not the friend you grew up with and you look up into  his face /none/ as the cloud fades and you can see an expression of immediate regret on his face  travis what what did i do  matt before you can respond though the bear behind you trinket snarls roar and latches on  go ahead and roll damage  laura do you

for clarification 15 points of piercing damage  taliesin math everybody  matt and trinket clenches down you feel the armor plates jamming together and it wrenches your  shoulder out of the socket not enough to actually do too much serious damage and immediately  trinket pulls away and you hear this whine behind you this sad moaning his nose rubs against  your head  ashley i put my /none/ hand out and touch his nose and tell him its okay  laura and marisha oh  matt okay orthax is at a point where no orthax is going to turn and begin to chase after  percy now  taliesin attack of opportunity

marisha nat 20s all up in this bitch  laura 24  matt okay /none/ and pike  ashley 16  matt 16 does not hit unfortunately so pike you swing but still in pain from trinkets attack  and grog coming at

trinket awesome  travis muttering 20 21 22 louder 31 total  matt 31 total how do you and trinket want to do this  cheering  ashley wait did you kill /none/ him  laura yeah  ashley oh yes  travis id like to pick up the hammer and slam him down to the ground just so hes at trinkets  head height  laura and then right when he gets to his height trinket reaches up and bites him as hard as he can  and lashes him around like dog with a toy  matt okay as you slam it on the ground boof the smoke billows out around it and dissipates for  a moment where as opposed to its obscured form you now have a very clear /none/ view of its physical  body just a little bit of smoke trailing about where its lower torso and legs would be as its  arms reach out slashing noise grunt and it looks up its head shaking as the purple cracks  are rising up its body it looks up straight into the face of trinket who snarls growl chomp  and just lunges out clamping onto its face and tearing upward its head arcing in the air as it  does the body whoosh dissipates into smoke and sinks into the ground into this black shadow in  /none/ the dirt that whoosh races up the hallway in the direction of percy  percy as youre stopping and looking over you look down just in time for the shadow to whoosh  reach your legs and you feel this cold rise up your body and then slowly dissipate into this  little nugget of cold in the center of your chest and then vanish  ashley wait but doesnt he have protection  marisha how about the protection  laura he disappears it disappeared maybe it disappeared forever  sam or maybe its always going to be there haunting /none/ us  liam while hes thinking i walk up to delilah grab her by the clothes drag her to the side of  the wall and prop her up and turn to percy and say end this  taliesin cassandra  matt cassandra who has now stopped looks at you she clutches the rapier in her hand and you  can see her hand shaking the tension of the muscles in her fingers clenching it as hard as she  possibly can as she walks up with each slow quiet step echoing across the stone footsteps  delilah up against /none/ the wall blood spilling out of the corner of her mouth coughs coughing  conscious with her one missing arm to the side bloods beginning to ooze now from the wound as  the sheer force of all the movement has torn the wounds fresh open and shes there and she looks  over out of the corner of her eye and turns seeing the rest of you and sees cassandra as  cassandra steps up she holds the rapier at her side staring down this time a single tear  cresting down the side of her cheek delilah looks /none/ up and goes you could have been my daughter  she looks down at delilah and says no cassandra is a de rolo and you took them away from me and  now were taking everything away from you and thrusts the rapier forward right into the chest  as it hits her it actually pulls her up about a foot against the wall the sheer force of the  wound gasps sighs last breath escaping from delilahs mouth her arm falls limp to the side  the moment of tension passes and cassandras still holding her there her head /none/ down her hair in  front of her face just shaking keeping her pinned against the wall  laura whispering percival  taliesin i put my hand on her shoulder and gently pull her back  matt the rapier withdraws and the body tumbles to the ground she looks back at you face just a  mess thank you  taliesin we have a lot to do  matt we do and she hands the rapier back to you and she grabs the scruff of delilahs collar  and begins dragging her up the hallway towards the castle  laura /none/ wait i meant to loot her earlier and it didnt happen sorry i just  really like that part  matt she drops the body and gives you a look hurry if theres one thing ive learned here in  whitestone its that things do not stay dead long  liam seeing as im 50 feet ahead of my sister i walk ahead of her  laura dont you fucking do this to me  liam is she wearing a cloak  matt laughs okay inspecting the body you find a very fine pair of metallic bracers  laura gasps /none/ for archery purposes  liam youre not here  laura im like five feet away from you at this

like cloth at a distance close up you can see its actually a very fine dark blackpurple  fur and down at the side of it you see dangling these two long tentacles that end in these little  cupping spiked elements it looks like it was carved from a creature at one point  liam this is the cloak  matt the cloak  marisha can i do a nature check to see  matt go for it  marisha because i think i know what it is  laura i get up in time to /none/ smack him upside the head  marisha 29  matt yeah youve actually fought these creatures before this is a displacer beast its a cloak of  displacement  liam
