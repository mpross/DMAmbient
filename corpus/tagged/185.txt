mouth just your mouth you had two noses  matt oh i had two noses there we go thats much better thank you sam for that nightmare fuel  laura why do i have so many teeth  sam i thought it would look weird  matt all right last we left off the mighty nein had allied themselves with captain avantika of the  squalleater a pirate making /none/ her way through the swavain islands in search of ways to unlock this  entity that she was fanatically obsessed with this ukotoa which was revealed to be the patron  to fjords abilities after retrieving one of these soughtafter orbs from this longreused  temple by the snake folk on the island and apparently unlocking one of these seals you made  your way back to darktow on her ship did a bit of piracy arrived were introduced to the plank  king who looks over the revelry the band of pirates that helm this side pardon me of /none/ the  lucidian ocean you then decided to have a plan to break into the squalleater at night while everyone  was at rest or some of you at rest some were distracting the captain in doing so you managed  to uncover a wellhidden journal of avantika that was written in some sort of a cipher  laura kind of like the journal  matt kind of like the journal didnt quite look like that but artistic interpretation your  entrance was solid your exit left a couple of signs of disturbance but nothing implicating you  returned and /none/ through the evening and the luck of a ridiculous roll you managed to via caleb  break the cipher on it after knowing what information was there through your spell and  write a cipher to allow anybody to read the contents of this journal and see whats within  however the morning in which you awoke you discovered that the crew at least had seemed to  have noticed all these strange events through the night the ransacked chamber pointed to some  tomfoolery you were all asked to make your way to the shipyard to meet with avantika /none/ and the crew on  the squalleater with not far behind you on the docks the rest of the crew of the mistake being  brought as well upon you stepping up and encountering this moment of tension it seems  that through veras glance through some form of divination magic while some people have guarding  objects or items against themselves being sought through divination certain objects in pockets are  not free of it they glanced over in calebs direction and in that moment you cast wall of  fire before we get too far into this i /none/ need you to place your wall of fire for me please on this battlefield  travis take your time take your time  sam what can it do can it go up things  liam 20 feet tall i can choose which side the wall burns 10feet reach and which side does not  laura ooh thats good thats good  sam this is going to be hard on the boat  travis take your time take your time the longer you take  liam this table cant bear my weight  laura it can too because we all got /none/ on the table for sams one shot  sam now available on youtube guys  matt okay while youre doing this im going to put this up there now the announcements are complete  liam i dont know how i would make it go on an angle without causing problems  travis well just assume it covers that right yeah  matt yeah best you can  liam best i can  taliesin oh sweet jesus  matt oh youre creating a u  sam is that possible  liam well this isnt what i imagined in my head but /none/ we are standing where we are standing so im  going with what i see  matt okay  travis yeah i dig it  liam okay i want that to go like that but its not going  sam the whole show is just this  matt this is it this is the entire thing  laura oh my lord  travis its actually really cool looking  liam i would like the last one to be on this gentleman  matt okay well place it here  liam leaving room to get to this gangway but hes burning /none/ and thats going like this  matt well say that he is currently  sam ablaze  liam facing this to there also allowing access to both the gangplanks  clattering laughter  matt that was amazing  travis that was the best thing that could have happened  matt all righty meticulous placement be damned  taliesin someones getting velcro in their stocking  matt yeah  liam i cant make them stick man  matt its fine liam leave it leave it alone youve lost miniature privileges  travis he was there too he was there  matt /none/ in the final moment we lost one of them up top too  liam fucking real dd people it went better in rehearsal  matt sure thatll do  liam we all know im not going to touch it the gangplanks are open  sam we lost a guy on top wasnt there a guy on top  travis hes right here behind avantika  liam thats right hes just out of your line of sight  matt perfect now meticulously carefully placed to not waste anyones time at that moment you  all noticing this moment of tension theres /none/ a flash from calebs hands figures their eyes dart  in his direction as he finishes releasing his arms and firing out of the actual deck of the ship you  see a 20foot tall high wall of roaring flame and fire burn around in a ushape encompassing the  exterior you can feel the heat on you but its not so intense as to hurt however i need you to  roll damage  liam its a tenfoot reach on the outside of this thing  matt correct thats 5d8 fire damage if you dont mind  travis on /none/ the burn side  liam on the outside i choose the side so clearly im not going to burn us  travis anyone within ten feet of the outside gets 5d8  marisha thats fucking rad kill some bitches  travis i dont know why i didnt expect it to be that amazing  liam shit bad rolls 17 total  sam thats fine thats a good start  matt thats a success for the dwarf over there he takes  liam a one a two and a three were the first three rolls  matt thats a shame eight /none/ damage for him for bouldergut that is a failure  liam also to toss out the flames are opaque so they cannot be seen through  matt mmhmm 17 for bouldergut to the guy it got put on directly thats a failure on his point he  takes a full 17 points of damage the guy whos guarding the other plank there thats a failure  on him he takes 17 avantika fails with a natural one avantika takes a full 17 then we have the  guy over there he fails with a three he takes another 17 then /none/ vera rolls a natural 20 veras  right there vera takes eight now that the wall of fire is in place crackling around you  blackening the surface of the deck the roaring of its sound as it whooshing roll initiative please  travis advantage for yasha  matt i prerolled initiative for the guys here to keep it going 25 to 20  marisha hang on 24  matt all right 20 to 15 anybody  travis yasha has a 15  laura oh im 19  matt we have jester and yasha  laura wait beau jester yasha /none/  travis yeah  sam thats great  matt 15 to ten  taliesin 12  travis 11 for fjord  matt fjord at 11  taliesin 12  travis beau jester yasha caduceus fjord  matt all right ten to five  liam eight  travis how do you spell your name caleb thats right  laura im so nervous what are our names  sam oh shoot im a nine i didnt say sorry  laura youre above caleb thanks for fucking up everyones list  sam sorry im nervous guys  matt thats all right top of /none/ the combat round as the flames are crackling around you hear  screams from crewmen that are too close and having to pull back and someone starts shouting fire  off to the side from this side of the docks beau youre up first what are you doing  travis i can see your pulse in your neck  marisha can you im dying i might be having a heart attack beau reaches around and scuffles  around to caleb and goes give me the notebook im sticking with the plan  sam okay  laura are you going to /none/ grab it from him  marisha yes im going to grab it from you  liam okay its wedged into my belt yeah okay  marisha then i look at jester  travis this is the most precarious operation game ever  matt isnt it though thats fine thatll work  marisha i cant hold a movement right  matt no only an action  marisha was taking the book an action  matt ill say running up to him and then going give me the book him rummaging through it or  you helping him rummage through and grab /none/ it ill consider that an action because that takes a few  seconds to do its not something he had ready youve moved 15 feet to get over there and then  your action  marisha how far away is jester from me now  matt jester was right next to you when you started  marisha i run back to jester  matt thats another 15 feet thats 30 foot of your movement  marisha i say lets get out of here  laura okay  marisha thats my turn  matt okay that finishes beaus go avantikas up /none/ next  marisha oh i could have done patient defense i should have done it  travis she cant see in here i think  matt she cannot see but what she can do is control water  sam oh  matt seeing this flames happen she groans pulls back closes her eyes for a second and  raises her scarred hand where the sphere that she unlocked ukotoa with raised up at that point  the water from the ocean begins to rise  liam counterspell  matt all right its a 4thlevel spell so i need you to /none/ roll  liam i know and its at disadvantage gasps  marisha what did you get  liam i rolled a 14 and a 19 she fails  matt she does  cheering and laughter  travis look at the veins oh my god  sam that was two weeks of tension being released  travis orgasms all under the table right now  matt holy shit you watch as the ocean begins to swell upwards avantika raises her arm but you  said the walls are opaque can you see through the walls  liam can i hear her /none/ go arcane chanting  matt make a perception check  groaning  sam this is a fair point  liam oh natural 20 and a 16 plus perception the lowest roll was a 19  laura i like that you dont know where your perception is right now  liam i never do  matt yeah it doesnt require you to have seen the person you know the spells happening you  know the direction of the person you rolled a high enough perception ill allow it as you hear  her chanting beneath her breath and you hear the /none/ wave rising you glance over in the direction and  you having an instinctual affinity with flames and fire can barely see the darkened shape of her  on the opposite side of the flames being warped by the light using that moment you put your hand  forward and release the destructive pattern of your counterspell with that the swelling ocean  splatters back down to the surface  travis oh my god now you can die happy  matt as that happens you hear her go merde and she begins to back up over to here onto the /none/  side and starts shouting vera thats going to end her turn because that was her action  travis i wonder how many times she can do that  matt jester  laura okay i remember we went to the plank king and we took the path to get to him how far away  is the base of his mountain his stairs  matt from where you are right now its probably somewhere between 1200 and 1500 feet maybe  laura okay can i get 500 feet on the path to there with dimension door i grab beau around /town/ the  waist and say come with me i cast dimension door ten feet above the ground i say get ready  to land so i dont land on a person  marisha so considerate of you  taliesin wow this is a look  matt beau and jester vanish from sight in a puff of purplishpink smoke they both are gone thats  your action  laura yes  matt you suddenly find yourself appearing in the center of the cobblestone street with the bloated  cup maybe about two or three blocks up that way on the familiar /none/ path you know that you took hooking  around the side that led you to the throne roost  laura oh my gosh  marisha oh my god  matt you also do notice now that there are some folks and some of the revelry watch that are now  glancing over at the very bright inferno that is this beacon of flame over there in the shipyard  you appear out of nowhere and theres two of them that look over in your direction noticing you  appear thats all thats all that happens you still have your movement /none/ and your bonus  laura im going to start moving towards yeah okay i start moving towards the plank king  marisha ill catch up with you  matt okay good to know that finishes jesters go yashas up  travis yasha what is she doing again wow my brain is so scrambled  taliesin i know its hard to think right now  matt youre down two party members in the middle of a u of flames  travis yeah shes over here right is this her okay  matt thats two hours of online research about control water /none/ and wall of fire and interactions  completely mute that is awesome  liam and matt good game  travis were getting the fuck out right  matt what are you doing yasha  travis yasha is going to use her movement to run off she would like to is she raging  matt if she doesnt make an attack and isnt attacked she loses her rage  travis she will use her movement to head towards the side of the ship and try to exit the craft  and lets see how far we get  matt okay she /none/ scoots by the one guy whos currently so thatd be counting 35 right there  travis and 40 is her speed  matt so she can get there as she swings by the one guy thats currently in the wall of fire is  like shit he glances out of the corner of his eye and sees her go by and he gets one attack of  opportunity swinging at her as she streaks through the space thats going to be a 15 to hit  travis ugh it hits  matt okay in an errant backhand swing shes got /none/ meaty hit points though thats going to be  eight points of slashing damage to yasha as she rushes past  travis great she will use her bonus action to rage  matt okay  travis yep that will be her turn  matt shes not going to do anything with her action she can dash with her action and move  again if youre trying to get her to move  travis oh yeah double dash yeah im sorry a little frazzled  matt 40 whats her movement  travis 40 and bonus to rage  matt all right /none/ as she charges past that guard sees her running and goes wait theres a huge  distraction now this person here who saw all of a sudden the flames erupt who was part of avantikas  crew one of the crew members is going to take an attack of opportunity at her as well as she runs  past she is raging though so she takes half damage ooh thats going to be a 21 to hit  travis hits  matt she takes another eight damage but its reduced to four that finishes yashas go  caduceus youre up /none/  taliesin okay i just saw that we are running apparently  matt you see yasha run past you you look over and you watch as beau and jester blink theyre gone  taliesin well okay lets see im going to follow yasha because thats apparently the way  how much distance can i cover how close to her can i get  matt well find out movement 30 if youre rushing past her  taliesin is there an easier way off or is that the easiest way off the boat  matt there are three ways off the boat /none/ theres either this gangplank which is closer to you  this gangplank which is further from you but generally will meet the same distance or jumping  in the water  taliesin oh yeah whichever way gets me closer to her quickly  travis youre such a fan of the water though taliesin  taliesin im learning  matt counting 30 gets you halfway on the plank there  taliesin okay ill take that other 30 for now then  matt counting 30 youre right behind yasha that character does not get an attack of  opportunity on you because /none/ they already used their reaction to hit yasha  taliesin yeah im going to hold there for now  matt okay that finishes your turn now its fjord aside from avantika the rest of them  rolled pisspoor initiative which is to your advantage  travis okay fjord is going to am i standing right next to caleb  matt you are currently yes as far as wall of fire goes im checking the damage on that is  that at the top of their turn  liam are you asking oh youre asking me  matt oh at the /none/ end of each turn  liam if they end their turn or the first time it hits them  matt first time they enter it got you okay good to know so if they dont leave that area  liam when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there  matt got you all right cool thank you  travis i am going to use my movement to make sure that i walk up and put a hand on calebs shoulder  im going to hold thunder step until nott moves  /none/ matt you are going to begin casting thunder step  travis but look at nott and wait  matt youre readying it as a spell  travis readying it as a spell yeah the second he moves  matt to trigger the instant nott moves youve got it okay  liam moves or clears the  travis if he moves yeah  matt got you he said moves all right that finishes your go now its boulderguts turn  bouldergut angry about the flames goes angry groan looking aback batting at them a little  bit with her arm goes /none/ and steps through the wall she takes the damage again roll another 5d8 that  is going to step into the space where the flames are no longer touching her and on the outside its  not burning  liam 24 that time  matt yeah they dont get a saving throw by walking through it she takes your damage whats  the damage  liam 24  matt bouldergut comes through singed you see it as bits of her hair are curled up and red at the  tips from where elements of it have turned to ember and /none/ takes a giant swing with her twohanded  great club at you  liam thats going to hit  matt yeah that is thats a 23 to hit  liam absolutely  matt all right so with that thats 15 points of bludgeoning damage make a constitution save  liam its a ten right because its half  matt its half or ten whichever is higher so constitution saving throw  liam at disadvantage  matt only ability checks are at disadvantage not saving throws  liam oh saving throw well i rolled twice  matt just roll one more /none/ time  liam straight because they were both pretty good natural 20  relieved cheering  matt fantastic she swings with her second attack that is 19 to hit  liam hits yeah  matt that ooh 17 points of damage another dc10 make another constitution saving throw  liam thats balls that is just a seven  matt the flames flicker out as your concentration is abruptly broken by the ogre that stepped  through the fire wall and twice bashed ford and caleb right there  sam all plans go wrong guys its okay its okay  marisha /none/ its you know we anticipated this  sam weve still got two clerics somewhere in the world  matt that ends boulderguts turn now that comes to nott and vera going at the same time in the  same initiative count you have a higher dexterity than vera so im letting you go first  sam nott is going to stick with the plan and run towards that gangplank and get out of dodge  matt five ten 15 youre triggering your  travis thunder step  matt thunder step 15 are you going down the gangplank  sam yeah /none/ as soon as i crest it when i get up there theyre gone by that point right  matt so what do you do now you do  travis 3d10 damage and we  matt in what radius  travis within ten feet  matt within ten feet that will get bouldergut it wont get anybody else after slamming her club  twice into caleb youre holding his shoulder as the impact is causing him to nearly crumple  against you you lift him up under the arm right as the spell finishes and thunder crack  travis 18 points /none/ of thunder damage and caleb and i will disappear and reappear 90 feet in the  direction of the base of the hill  matt you are over here all right  sam whos still on the ship  matt with a loud heavy burst of thunder impacts  sam its just me now right  matt crackling through the air surrounding the shipyard with that both caleb and fjord vanish  and reappear across the distance landing on the creaking wood of the old rickety dock hearing the  footsteps behind you of caduceus and yasha trying to catch /none/ up the guard all looking confused at  whats transpiring and a little ways down the way you can see theres about five or six other guards  that are walking alongside the rest of the crew of the mistake that are all stopping and seeing  whats going on here thats the end of your go you still have 15 feet of movement  sam yeah i will nott will continue to run down that sorry no she gets to the top of the  gangplank shes going to turn around and nail vera with a bolt  matt /none/ okay  marisha thats so punk rock  matt roll for an attack  sam i dont think its sneak attack or anything  matt its not  sam its only a 12 no 14 to hit  matt 14 you needed a 15 yeah that mage armor manages to deflect it  sam all right well then ill just keep running down the plank and then use bonus action to dash  another 30 feet  matt all right youre right before yasha with that vera is going to take her turn vera steps  up the side counting /none/ 30 and is now up on the top of the ship glancing over as everyone charges  past she raises her arm come great serpent of the sea and she raises her hand above and brings  her fingers together into a fist as she brings it down slowly like theres force against her fist  you watch as this white cloud begins to appear and hailstonelike shards of ice begin to pelt down  onto the dock below into this radius right here it does manage to get the guard as well  taliesin i was going to say /none/ theyre going to hit the guard  marisha good going to piss that guard off  matt what that does is it also turns this area into rough terrain until the end of her next turn  he is there you guys are all here  liam does the cloud remain in the sky  matt the cloud has vanished now  liam okay so it was a one time  sam okay  matt however i need you all to make here we go its an ice storm spell dexterity saving  throw from the three of you please /none/ if you dont mind  sam 19 for me  matt success for you  taliesin 20 for me  matt success for you and roll for yasha as well if you dont mind  travis what am i rolling  all dexterity save  travis she gets advantage on those  sam ive never seen travis this nervous before  travis im so flustered  taliesin my heart is fucking racing right now i am not okay  travis thats 11 for yasha  matt yasha fails yasha takes 22 points of cold damage thats 11 points to caduceus /none/ and nott  although none to you because you succeeded and you have evasion so you take none  sam is that how that works wow cool  matt thats what rogues can do yeah whenever you have to make a dex save against an effect  take half damage if you succeed you take no damage if you fail you take half you should  read your character sheet  travis can i do fanatical focus  matt yes you may  travis im going to do the fanatical focus once per day  matt so you get to /none/ reroll that once  travis 19 plus two is 21  matt okay so she only takes 11 however everything in this for the next round is  difficult terrain as theres now giant hailstones and sleet slicked all over the rickety docks  sam is it half movement  matt yes  sam okay  matt thats going to end veras go now it comes to caleb  liam oh yeah okay  matt hanging over here on the side  liam are there any crates or anything around on the dock that look liftable from catapult  matt /none/ there are two chests off to the side there  liam okay if they look light enough i will throw one up into the air at avantikas head  matt okay go for the roll on that  sam throw ice  matt hes throwing one of the chests over here  sam oh one of the chests  liam no i am going instead to cast expeditious retreat on myself and at the same time change the  focus on my transmuter stone to a constitution buff thats it im going to jet back 90 feet  sam 90 /none/ feet  matt you dart forward across the guards that are there watching this happen with the rest of  the crew of the mistake you zip past them in this blur flashlike entity they all get pushed back  from the impact as you push through all right that finishes your turn now its the  guards the guards  taliesin did that guard take damage  matt that guard did take damage  taliesin okay  matt hes looking real rough hes going to back up out of the middle of the sleet and make his way  /none/ this way he looks dazed and is trying to figure out whats going on and where to ally himself  with you guys go running off the side as the flames are down theyre going to give chase this  guards going to rush up here and this guys going to rush up here theyre not attacking but  theyre coming out towards you and saying stop stop halt theyre shouting towards you guys to  stop the rest of the guards are going to push forward and start making their way up this  direction and theyre starting to /none/ theyre now catching up four of them are going up towards  fjord and one of them is going back towards caleb theyre starting to gather and theyre putting up  their hands like do not flee theyre not talking yet but you see their physicality is like we  dont know whats happening but dont you go anywhere  travis yeah no i wouldnt dream of it  matt that ends their go its now ipess turn as a bonus action hes going to hide and move  underneath and around the rocks to this side and hes going /none/ to pull around from the corner with his  hand crossbow and take a shot at caduceus from behind caduceus whats your passive perception  taliesin my passive perception is 18  matt 18 okay you do notice him out of the corner of your eye just barely so he is not  hidden from you this means he does not get sneak attack damage or advantage on the attack that is  still a natural 20 on this hit  taliesin is he within 30 feet of me wait no i can cast this on myself cant i  /none/ matt which one  taliesin can i cast let me take a look really quick if i can do this sentinel can i cast  sentinel on myself  matt what does it say whats the wording  taliesin as a reaction when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet  matt when you or a creature  taliesin oh yeah  matt then yeah  taliesin so none of that  matt you channel divinity to prevent the critical it is now a regular hit fantastic you  take three points of piercing damage it sticks /none/ into your shield and grinds inside and actually  hits a little bit of the forearm but you manage to deflect most of the impact and bolt gets caught  in the center of there mostly no damage to you  taliesin nervous laugh cool  matt one of the guards turns and looks towards ipess actually both of these guards turn and  glance over and having this moment of not entirely certain which side to go with  taliesin i am looking irritated at the guards at this  matt that ends there its now the rest of /none/ the crews turn hes going to come to the side there  this ones going to move over to this side there this guys going to run across this ones going  to move over here and this half orcs going to go and hide in there  sam dont forget our crows nest guy  matt with that weve got some heavy crossbow action from this guy and this guy caleb is out of  range of both of them unfortunately both of these guys right here im going to roll four attacks  one of them is going /none/ to be heavy crossbow to fjord because fjord is still within oh no its  a 400foot range for the next one  sam 400 feet  matt yeah heavy crossbow with 100 feet youre going to be within the disadvantage range  increment but those things are going to fire at you caleb since youre the one thats the  furthest away  taliesin caleb is not within 30 feet of me either is he  matt no  taliesin just checking  matt he does have disadvantage on the attack though that is a 16 and a 13 /none/ naturally  liam it hits  matt plus four its going to be 17  liam my ac is 11  laura whoa thats really low  matt that is nine points of piercing damage to you  liam oh i have nine hit points  matt are you serious  liam yeah im out  matt caleb thud as he darts past this bolt streaks past impact noise in the back and with  the momentum of his running he crumples into the ground and tumbles and skids to a halt in the  middle youre watching this fjord /none/ as this happens the other one up here at the top of the  crows nest is going to take a shot at nott actually you are within the 100foot range  thats still a natural two so it misses you it splinters the wood right next to your foot as you  step out of the way shards of wood go flying from the impact and the heavy bolt about that long is  jammed at an angle into the planks before you this one here and this one are both going to take  heavy crossbow shots ones /none/ at caduceus and ones at yasha so the most visible against caduceus  oh man theyre rolling terrible now thats a six  taliesin im not even going to dignify that  matt yeah yasha however does get hit with a 17 i believe right  taliesin travis yes  travis what sorry  matt yasha takes eight points of piercing damage 17 to hit eight points reduced to four  travis got it  matt this guy here has a hand crossbow you are then in disadvantage range hes going to take  another shot at caduceus with disadvantage /none/ no thats another six  taliesin he aint going to be hitting me  matt okay thats the end of the crewmen there thats the end of the combat round these people  seeing all the fighting are going to duck into their ship and hide this team on this end they  all move out of the way but theyre keeping an eye over the side of whats happening top of  the combat round beau and jester you appear beau in the middle of this chaos flames behind  you you hear a thunderous blast that echoes from /tavern/ behind you glance over you look forward  jesters already running in the direction youre on the rough and tumble rock and elements of  cobblestone that have long worn off and not been replaced in front of you a little ways up ahead  you can see the tavern  marisha the tavern  matt the bloated cup  marisha i want to go around and i want to go straight towards the plank king  matt okay so you full run  marisha i go jester ill see you there i dart by and i also want to /town/ burn a ki point to do step  of the wind and run my full 135foot movement towards  matt in doing so you make it all the way up the streets there and theres buildings on each  side to the front right of youthis perspective for you on this side is where you see the tavern  there are folks out there morning drinking like whoa watch you whiz past you make your way up  the street a little further and there are a few town guards that are looking over towards the inn  the sound /town/ and all the craziness happening and they notice you approaching and they all  instinctively begin to go into a phalanx they all go shouldertoshoulder and theyre now blocking  off the road from your continual passage no weapons drawn but in the midst of all this they  see crazy stuff happening and the one person darting at an inhuman speed away from it and  their instinct is to go whoa whoa whoa lets figure this out theyre not aggressive yet  thats your turn  marisha can i say anything  matt id say this happens at /none/ the very end of your turn youre running running running all of a  sudden you stop right as they clanking right there in front of you well pick that up next turn  marisha okay  matt that brings us to avantikas go all right oh man okay avantika is going to leap down off  the side of the ship acrobatics check  travis and slip on the ice  matt no its just difficult terrain  travis just kidding wishful thinking  matt i will say it would increase the dc for her landing ill give you /none/ that but she did roll an  18 on her acrobatics check  travis yeah thats pretty good  matt leaping down lands right in front of nott skids down lands a few inches back before coming  to a stop the ice grinds at the back of her foot and creates this little pile where the momentum  eventually stops holding her rapier in one hand and the dagger in the other looking down at you  nott goes ah you should not have crossed me shes going to take three strikes at you two with  her rapier /dung/ and one with her dagger the dagger you can see now is youve seen it a little bit  in the battles you were in dark spaces so it was hard to make a real distinguishing visual of it  but out here in the open air as shes clutching the dagger aggressively theres a faint black  energy faintly drifting off the edge of the blade the attack with the rapier first one natural  four no its going to miss you natural three both rapier shots nothing the dagger however  thats going to be a 17 to /none/ hit  sam that hits  matt okay shes rolling real bad as the two rapier shots you dodge out of the way but she  uses that to feint forward and jam the blade up into the front of your stomach and rib cage area  that is going to be nine points of piercing damage and an additional eight points of necrotic damage  sam uncanny dodge  matt okay  sam does that halve both of those  matt yeah it would halve both from the attack so take eight points of damage you manage to push /town/  away with your momentum the blade doesnt sink quite as deep and you grabbing the wrist  preventing it from really coming to the hilt in your chest you pull away thats going to end her  turn she shouts over her shoulder and goes vera we need friends jester your turn  laura okay  matt you saw beauregard dart up past you  laura is there an alley near me  matt if you look a little bit ahead of you around each of the buildings that are right in  front of you there are alleys /town/ that curve around that would eventually meet in the road that you  guys are currently running down  laura anywhere where i can duck and cast disguise self really fast  matt yes but youd have to move up you probably wouldnt be able to get to an alley to do it this  turn there are people around there are folks that are watching all this chaos happen off in the distance  laura okay then im going to shout avantika is attacking people on the island shes trying to  upstage the plank king everybody go see /none/ now  matt okay make a deception check  marisha can the guards that im near hear her  matt youre a little ways up ill roll a perception check for them how about that  laura 14  matt thats a cocked roll the guards unfortunately do not hear it theyre not as  perceptive and their focus is distracted between this and they hear shouting but theyre not  picking up the words however some of the folks nearby glance over at you and go oh shit  really finishes his drink real fast  laura spread the /tavern/ word  matt ive got to go see this they seem less worried about their lives and more like oh i  want to go see how this goes down  liam vannas going on a prank binge  marisha fight fight fight  laura right right is anybody around me now  matt theyre not around in front of you theres one coming out of a building and you see a couple  folks that are on the front porch entrance area of the tavern  laura i dont know if i want to run back or help beau /none/  matt its up to you what are you doing  laura im going to head back to the group im going to start running towards the group  matt okay jester you turn around and start heading back towards the group its a long run  because you went 500 feet from the ship  laura i know im going to duck into an alley as soon as its near so i can cast disguise self on  my next turn  matt you go for it that finishes your go yashas up  travis yeah yashas up she /none/ is going to make two attacks against avantika shell move into melee  with her and will make them both reckless attacks  matt shes going to use her reaction to parry which adds a plus two to her armor class  travis thats a 17 to hit  matt that misses  travis good to know these are terrible rolls thats a 25 to hit  matt 25 hits  sam take her head off yasha  travis 14 points of damage  matt 14 points of damage to avantika as the blade carves through she tries to parry /none/ it with  the rapier but it slips down and carves a slight bit off of her forearm before it gleans off and  you can see a little bit of red immediately exposed where the cloth was carved through and a  little bit of the skin and flesh removed with it  travis she will use the rest of her movement to keep running up the dock  matt okay thats going to be counting 40 thats as far as she can get  travis right because its fucking shitty terrain  matt difficult terrain yep  travis /none/ does she have anything that keeps her from  marisha dealing with that  travis like angel of death problem no  matt as an action you can angel of death  marisha wings on ice  matt theyre more for the surprise party factor than the actual flight thing  travis nope i dont see anything  matt okay that finishes yashas go caduceus youre up  taliesin oh man wow i am really stuck on that arent i thats irritating  matt theres the guards there theres avantika avantika does not have a reaction she already  used /none/ it to parry  taliesin thats difficult terrain though so if i burn my action im only going to get 30 feet  matt correct  taliesin hmm lets get weird okay  travis yeah lets lets do it  liam get weird taliesin get weird  sam im going to make all the ice turn into bugs  taliesin im going to vanish thats the first thing im going to do  matt ill say for the purposes of keeping tabs on you this will be your marker  sam ooh cool marker  marisha seethrough caduceus  taliesin /none/ theres a joke there that i cannot think of what it is because im too freaked out i can  cast while im invisible correct  matt no its your ability as soon as you cast something you lose your invisibility  taliesin well the invisibility only lasts one round  matt actually let me check the wording on that if its different from the actual spell because  usually its  taliesin not a big deal  liam this encounters getting to me my body is radiating heat im hot everywhere flames on the  side of my face /none/  matt can magically turn invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack make  a damage roll or force someone to make a saving throw you can cast a spell as long as it doesnt  damage or attack somebody  taliesin as long as its not a damage spell i can just  matt or force someone to make a saving throw  taliesin oh okay yeah ill just ignore that then ill stay invisible and im going to try and  take my 60 feet  matt it would be 30 feet with /none/ this  taliesin yeah my 30  matt counting  taliesin can i get one further away just to  matt you can go at an angle in front of yasha  taliesin yeah just to get a little cover thank you  matt that ends your go caduceus fjord youre up your friends are catching up behind you  theres a sleet storm slamming theres guards swarming around your direction telling you to  halt and up ahead of you you watched a speedy caleb grind into the ground what are you doing  travis were going to get /none/ weird right all right  marisha getting weird  travis ill look up and point above the stern of the ship where vera is and my eyes will roll back  and ill say deep voice barlgura and i will summon greater demon  sam what  travis im going to drop a barlgura right on veras fucking head  liam that was a sick description  taliesin i have never been so proud  liam that was like babe ruth summoning a demon from hell  matt i wasnt sure if you had taken this spell i prepared for /dung/ it just in case  sam what is that  matt this is it  all whoa  laura bouldergut has met her love they start making out  matt youd be just on the edge of the ship there  travis thats great i want him right in their fucking business  sam if you walk away does he stay there  travis i only command him for one round and on that command i will say fuck up that crew  matt with the dark speech that emanates from inside of fjords body it echoes out like a /none/  weird discordant harmony of several voices youve never heard for those that are present you guys  are way the fuck away  travis fuck up that crew fuck up that crew fuck up that crew  matt theres the sound of reality cracking and you look up and watch where in the center of the  sky there at the very edge of the squalleaters deck two large meaty hands pull open this  barrier between the realms and stepping out you see this large gorillalike demon covered in fur  and horns at the edge these giant /none/ fists with tusks that emerge from beneath this chin and these  red burning coallike eyes as it steps out it turns right towards vera whose eyes are wide and  roars in her face you watch her hair get blown back a bit spittle across her chin thats your action  travis with my bonus action ill turn to the guards and go avantikas not to be trusted i  will misty step with my bonus action  matt all right you manage to misty step  travis 30 feet towards the direction of out the fuck out  /none/ matt okay this puts you  travis anywhere near caleb  liam 60 feet from caleb at this point i was 90 feet from fjord  matt correct you went 30 feet forward and you still have your movement  travis ill use the rest of my yeah i knew that im planning for that yeah ill use the  rest of my 30 feet to run towards that unconscious wizard  matt okay so you go heading towards caleb after shouting avantikas not to be trusted after  summoning a fucking demon im going to ask you to make /none/ a persuasion check with disadvantage because  you just summoned a fucking demon  laura creepily very creepily  marisha yeah  laura oh god oh god  groaning  travis six  matt all right well they seem to be more focused on what just appeared through the scar in  reality you left all right so you charge past youre coming upon the group of guards now that  are around the rest of the crew of the mistake but theyve forgotten about that crew at that  point they saw caleb rush past two of them went /none/ over to figure out what the hell happened as he  basically darted football fumbled off to the side the others are turning and coming towards  your direction but its not their turn yet  travis okay  matt all right that finishes your go fjord it is now boulderguts go  travis do i roll initiative for the barlgura  matt you do yes  travis oh thats a 17 plus i dont know if theres any bonus maybe its a 17  liam dex bonus  travis dex plus two so 19  matt 19 right after /none/ avantika  travis okay good puppy  matt oh man  travis nervous laughter and noises  liam bane impression your punishment will be more severe  laura it doesnt get to go as soon as you summon it  travis i dont it says it gets its own initiative  matt correct when you summon it on each of its turns thereafter you issue a verbal command to  it so you can keep issuing commands every turn however it doesnt go until its next initiative  all right thats real interesting  travis uh huh  liam this /none/ is fucking chaos  matt so boulderguts going to move counting im going to make a saving throw for the now  partiallydamaged okay yeah thats fine  travis the plank  matt the plank is going to snap gets her about there and is going do the dash up here the next  two guards who were now focused on bouldergut coming forward and theyre not entirely certain  whats happening theyre focused on the demon theres weirdness from all sides it seems the  watch are not used to this chaos breaking this far in towards darktow usually /none/ the reef and the  defenses they built around the reef are enough to keep things like this far from the island that  finishes boulderguts turn that brings us to nott and vera but nott you get to go first  sam i will run full speed through the difficult terrain how far can i get  matt counting youre next to yasha with your movement  sam okay then bonus another  matt counting 25 30  sam now im right in front of these guards  matt you are and you still have your bonus action  /none/ sam i used movement and bonus action to move and ill use action to whispering shit who do i  fuck up laughter theres no one engaged with anyone so theres no one i can do sneak attack  to instead ill do a hail mary ill take out a bit of fleece and rub it and speak some words  and cast phantasmal force on avantika  matt okay  sam shell probably save but its worth a shot  matt whats the save  sam 14 intelligence shes smart  travis roll low roll low  marisha natural /none/ one  matt natural five  travis ooh whats her modifier though  matt shes very good at a few things but she doesnt have the highest intelligence to get to  that point  sam okay  matt shes smart but not that smart  marisha she went to public school  matt i went to public school  marisha so did i  laughter  marisha we all have average intelligence lets be real  sam as bouldergut is walking over holding a pick or what  matt its a giant it looks like it once was a /none/ mast of a ship thats been whittled down into a greatclub  sam i want avantika to see bouldergut doing this and holding up the book holding up the book and  waving it around shes definitely holding that book  matt okay all right avantika glances over and sigh for a moment you see a look of relief  come over avantikas face  sam all right  matt all right is that your turn  sam yes thats it  matt you got it now its veras turn vera seeing this happen oh man  marisha but she /none/ believes it now how long does she believe it for  sam a minute  liam anything that keeps her occupied for one round but still  marisha okay okay a lot can happen in 60 seconds  matt all right veras going to glance off to the side actually shes going to try to move out of  melee of this barlgura  taliesin attack of opportunity  matt yeah  travis oh yeah  matt so make a strike  travis okay that is only a nine wait thats a nine  matt nine misses  marisha nine /none/  matt as the giant demon swings outward it impacts and deflects off the energy field of mage  armor that pushes it off to the side vera steps back the reach on that is five foot right for  the attack just making sure  travis yes five feet  matt okay she pulls out of it and goes harsh sigh looks down at avantika looks down at all  the guards that are gathering as theyre moving in  music plays  matt just barely from that angle there  taliesin fuck man  matt yeah that does /none/ it all right she goes after hearing what avantika said goes everyone  they have crossed darktow take them to the plank king you watch as shes saying these words her  hand sends this strange series of symbols through and casts mass suggestion on the guards in the  vicinity of 60 feet of her  travis mass mass suggestion  matt yes  travis thats new for me  taliesin being taken to the plank king aint bad  matt fail fail fail its working out great its like two seven four three ten fail  natural one /none/  taliesin do they even know who the plank king is  matt all of them failed you watch as all of these guards have the confusion suddenly  crystalizes and all of them look towards your group and start shouting stop them theyre thieves  travis oh fuck stammers were thieves  marisha they all failed their save he thinks that were the bad guys now  sam whispering we are kind of  laughter  matt vera after casting that is going to use the rest of her movement counting oh god  liam shes dead oh no /none/ she passed out  matt ill put her there its fine all right that ends veras turn caleb for your turn make  a death save its the beginning of your round i keep forgetting its the beginning of your turn  in case you roll a natural 20  liam that is these dice thats a 17  matt cool thats one success  liam yeah  matt all right  sam

watch as growl as it turns back to yell all of a sudden it gets another bolt in the chest and in  the side its getting all of these bolts that are now sticking out of its body as its raging  angrily on the deck of the ship you can see now theres a giant burned u on the side it wasnt  around long enough to catch the ship on fire but there is a dark scarring on the base /none/ of the deck  there all right one more round and it wouldve caught fire  liam fyi if id stayed conscious i wouldve thrown a fireball at that boat  matt laughter that wouldve been great  liam that was my next move  matt oh man all right that ends top of the round all right so beau the guards are there  in front of you right now theres three of them shoulder to shoulder and theres one of them that  looks the one in the center is a little betterarmored they go hey miss miss /none/ where  are you going theyre looking at you and both looking at whats over there  marisha i have requested evidence for the plank king he wants to see me directly its avantika  theres a coup shes trying to take over the city with a demon god  matt make a persuasion check  laura come on beau  marisha not deception  matt no because its honest  marisha persuasions not my best  matt there was nothing about that statement that was incorrect  marisha okay 13 above average  matt youre not sure if he /none/ believes you but hes not aggressive if that makes sense he goes  well be that as it may we need to figure out whats happening before we can have you running so  quickly with intent  marisha time is of the essence theyre killing pirates who do not bend the knee to her ive got  to get to him now let me pass  matt well send for him stay here and the two other guards stay there and hold the position and  fill in the space he turns around and starts making his way towards /none/ the throne roost  marisha let me come with you  matt he goes ah ive got it and he continues walking  sam kill the guards  matt well say that youve used an action at this point you still have your bonus and your  movement if you want to use it  travis bathe in their blood no no  matt its up to you you can go along with it and stay there and wait for your friends or anything  else you want to try they are not aggressive at this point theyre just holding /none/ the line  sam youve got a big stick  laura do not attack them  liam sam riegel shut the fuck up  marisha i  wait  travis yeah  matt the tension in your body is rising up and for a second the muscles bulge and the veins  begin to pop from the sheer amount of adrenaline thats in your system and your urge to charge  through you just breathe heavily as your entire form sinks into it the two guards you can see  their tension as their hands were going for a weapon /none/ drop they both go into a watching but  waiting pose that ends your go  liam with great power  matt its now avantikas turn avantika sees the guards shifting their allegiance under the effect  of this mass suggestion spell shes going to turn and attempt to go after yasha  travis okay  matt what  liam im angry at the villain thats what im supposed to be  matt yeah  liam youre doing great everything is fantastic im having a wonderful time  travis im having a wonderful time  liam my ears are going /none/ to combust  matt good shes making three strikes against her because shes the one closest to it yeah  shes not too hurt shes not doing anything defensively or you know what  marisha its so tempting im so tempted to just bust through there  liam its so in character  matt no yashas being held as far as she knows yasha is doing okay or the guards have her nott  is the one that keeps darting around so shes going to raise a hand and cast eldritch blast at nott  sam eldritch blast  matt /none/ ooh thats 24 to hit  sam thatll hit  matt you take three points of force damage as youre jumping off suddenly you get hit across  the chin but its a glancing blow and your world goes a little dizzy for a second the second one  misses entirely  sam you said three points right  matt yes  sam oh okay thats not as bad as i was preparing for  matt she didnt roll very good on the damage  travis does a grapple count towards keeping rage up is it an attack  matt /none/ technically a grapple is an attack yeah shes going to use her movement to back up five  six going towards this backing up towards the ship  travis she was not in melee with yasha right  matt correct instead of doing that she stayed back to do that and is now looking up towards the  demon that is raging onto the base of the ship seeing the guards have got this under the  suggestion spell she seems to be backing off slightly thats going to finish avantikas go  now its the barlguras turn  travis /none/ it is the barlgura is going to use its running leap to jump right on vera  matt ohhoho  marisha hot  travis it will unleash three attacks one with its bite and two with its fists and they will all  be reckless  matt

taliesin no its a concentration spell so /none/ a little something something  matt okay so that ends your turn or what else you doing  taliesin does it look like hes going to make an attack because im going to start scooting towards  matt theres no attack he looks startled and his hands are forward to try and theyre not  weapon drawn to bludgeon you but theyre trying to keep you from going anywhere  taliesin how far away is caleb currently  liam 95 or 100 feet  matt from where you are there 90 from there about 110 feet from you  taliesin /none/ im going to point and start walking that way just

movement to close to caleb  matt as /none/ you do you rush past some of the guards that are on the opposite side that were rushing  towards you theres i believe at this point four of them that were heading your direction  because there was the one that was going towards caleb so well say two of them youll have to  push past they both are going to make attacks of opportunity on you just an attempt to grapple to stop  travis okay  matt make your acrobatics or athletics check to try and break free  travis acrobatics or athletics well make it /none/ athletics straight up that is a 17  matt that succeeds they literally rolled a natural 14 plus two 16 was the highest roll the  other rolled a two you manage to shrug past you push out of his grasp hes like hey wait  travis great one more  matt well no you  travis that was it yeah oh okay ill run down and kneel next to caleb and go english accent  help me help this man i will pour a healing potion into his mouth  sam ooh he does have a

theyre all volunteer pirates of the revelry that  help keep watch on the shipyard here  taliesin they /none/ have an official sash  sam the ones around yasha are those the same guards or are any of these people from the ship  matt no the ones from the ship are further this way and they were being brought by guards but  theyve been left alone to focus on you guys yasha currently is stopped and theyre all very  much in a stay there type position theyre in the process of subduing their quarry  travis i healed caleb nine points  matt gotcha  sam i will disengage and make my way towards fjord and /none/ caleb  matt you slip past and make your way up towards fjord and caleb with your disengage and your  movement and your action you can make your way  sam 60 more feet i think  matt yeah 60 feet from there that would put you not quite to where they are but it gets you  up to where the other guards were that he rushed past and just beyond them because disengaged  they dont get any attacks of opportunity all right that ends your turn vera is looking not  too great vera is going /none/ to  travis laughter go  matt is going to cast scorching ray against the barlgura shes going to attempt

fireball and center it wheres vera  travis she was over here  matt in your state where do you want to put it  liam well wheres avantika i dont know /none/  matt you dont know where are you putting it  liam im putting it there at the mast  matt at the mast all righty as you wake up you spin fire this ray streaks past all the guards  who are calm at this point see this happen and watch the streak go by and detonate on the ship  the bright flash of light echoes against everybodys faces as the impact hits go ahead and  roll damage  liam i dont know whats going on im doing the last thing that was on my mind  /none/ matt yeah totally man  liam 8d6  sam avantikas not going to be alive to defend herself against our accusations  liam she will  matt thatll go well  travis that would be our line  sam

15 points of damage  to him oh hes dead hes fucking done he took damage from the fire wall earlier  sam oh thats the guy who was already at the gangplank /none/  matt yeah that guy he makes his save but he dies too  laura oh god  sam matts making me feel sad for these people  matt this guy doesnt make his save hes dead  laura oh god the whole crew is dead  sam this is what we do to crews on ships  matt roll for the barlgura  travis oh its incinerated it had three hit points even if he saves  matt yeah the barlgura is destroyed vera thats cocked  sam we hate seamen  matt that is 13 does not succeed /none/ vera takes 31 damage veras almost dead is burned incinerated  on the ground not moving  travis unconscious  taliesin what happens to her concentration spell  matt concentration spells lost  taliesin do the guards now know that they were being manipulated  matt it doesnt work like that unfortunately but their compulsions no longer there  liam they saw the fireball go over their heads yes  matt yeah with that the spell fades vera crumbles to the ground barlguras gone giant  explosion the mast leans slightly to one side from the impact this guy was /none/ out of the radius actually  taliesin still have to make a dex save from it though  matt id say if he hit the mast id say it hit him actually yeah  travis his poor feet hes like fuck  matt ipess has to make it as well he fails so he gets incinerated  travis how many life sentences are you serving caleb  matt ipess does make it i need you to make a wisdom saving throw caleb  liam multiple  matt no the dcs real high on this one  liam yeah im sure /none/ its going to fail this is a wisdom 18  matt as you go conscious you watch as bodies go flying off the side and fall limp to the side of  the dock their bodies still smoldering but unmoving you start flashing back to a very  painful memory and calebs eyes glaze over you are currently stunned  travis what no hey  matt okay that ends calebs turn the guards that were calm are no longer calm as they see you  do this the guards that were behind you charge in and all grapple both of /none/ you are you resisting  travis no  matt no all right you are dogpiled and grappled  sam oh god are we giving up  travis let me see yeah  sam theres only six or seven of them were super powerful  travis ive got crazy spells after the next short rest  matt all right damn  travis aint no stretch of time i aint ever done that could break a man  matt ipess looks around at the destroyed crew saw vera go down and runs up to try and see how  shes doing the /none/ remaining crew which is just the one here and this one here  laura is bouldergut still alive  matt boulderguts still alive barely barely  travis i think avantika thinks that bouldergut had the book would the book have taken the  fireball damage  matt currently the books still in her hands there was no variation in that  travis cool  matt the book is still held there in her hand okay thats going to end the crews turn coming  back to you beauregard as youre just waiting you keep waiting  marisha i tell the /none/ guards standing next to me because im assuming they saw the explosion of the  fireball im going to say more people die with each passing moment will you at least walk with  me time is of the essence here  matt dont do anything funny they turn around and start walking with you  liam thats a good deal yes yes yes  marisha i power walk like a grandma at a mall  matt theyre grunting trying to keep up a bit  marisha its 900am the doors just opened  travis those sweet allwhite new balance /none/  marisha got my insoles  matt avantika takes a quick glance at the scenario and opens the hatch and charges inside  of her ship  taliesin whats she got in there  sam dildos  laura just a big shipment of dildos  travis she does  laughter  matt at this point unless anyones going to resist combat comes to an end and we are now at a  role playing point at that moment well take a break unless you were doing anything  travis are you resisting  sam im running im not going back /none/ to jail  matt well take a break in a second then  travis im never going back  matt because when it gets to notts turn  sam yeah im going to bolt  matt okay if thats the case there are four guards now no because now two of them have  changed direction to go towards you and help subdue you guys theres two after you now  theyre both going to attempt to grapple you and stop you make two acrobatics checks  sam not great ten  matt ten on the first one  sam /none/ 17  matt both fail actually  sam oh they both got me  matt yeah that was a 12 and an 18  sam who are these guards i wasnt next to anybody  matt this was as you were charging through there and on their turn they moved up to you  travis they played sports when they were younger theyre really dextrous  matt your movements zero you cant escape well say that happened on their turn so on the  beginning of your turn youre grappled you can attempt to break free if you want to /none/  sam from one of them  matt actually thats an interesting point let me pull up my new fancy players handbook  all ooh  sam what is that  liam its their new limited edition  marisha its a box set its so fucking hot  matt unintentional commercial but these are so awesome  taliesin oh my god its too pretty  matt i think theyre brickandmortar only so youve

years of dd  marisha when are you going to be rich son  taliesin dd d  matt it doesnt say ill say make a check and well see if its high enough for each of them  sam its not its a two  matt no they hold tight you cant move your movements zero theyre both clutching you there  on the side  sam sighs i relent  matt okay with the chaos now coming to a stop and nott prevented from escaping /none/ though that  would have been a fun chase sequence now well go to a break  liam matt we have played this game for hundreds of hours together that was two of the best hours  of this game ever that was so much fun  matt man that was really intense  travis did we turn it on its head for you  matt oh there was a few things there that went differently than i expected  taliesin i was having so much treasure island flashes thats one of my favorite books and its  like all /none/ of this is so good all of its so good  matt before we go to the break we have our fantastic giveaway from our friends at wyrmwood  who are giving away this leatherinset zebrawood dice tray  marisha thats the one i got its so pretty  matt to join the contest you have to go and jump over to the critical role twitch chat thats at  twitchtvcriticalrole during the break and enter the keyword fire only enter it once more  than once and youll be disqualified once again unfortunately only the us and canada excluding /none/  quebec well have a winner for you at the end of the break see you guys then  travis oh my god  break  matt hello everyone and welcome back before we go in we have our winner of our fantastic  wyrmwood dice tray zebrawood dice tray the winner is wonderfulmouse congratulations  wonderfulmouse well get that sent to you asap  marisha so cute  matt diving back in as the rest of you stand there amongst the shipyard docks subdued by the  harbor watch the revelry watch there more gather and more gather id /none/ say about half the  watch of this city the volunteer mercenaries that take their shifts to keep their eye on their  island little haven there all flood the docks to see what the hell just went down you look up and  see the blackened charred sails of the ship treated against weathering but still darkened  from the blast of the fireball the wood itself darkened and splintered in places you can see  that giant burned u that marks the deck everything is held in place youre making your  way to the guards what are /none/ you doing jester you see beau being led up by the guards towards the  throne roost  laura okay you can do it beau do i see the big fire explosion too as it happens  matt oh yeah you saw and heard the distant explosion  taliesin whitestone saw the fire  travis singing whitestone saw the fire  laura oh okay i hope everyones okay please traveler be with them im going to start running  towards the docks in disguise  matt okay the guards have now pulled you all to your feet and have begun /none/ to apply manacles to  your hands not anything too aggressive but for the purpose of safety and to maintain the order  within this community theyre particular and careful they also go onto the deck and you see  them beginning to collect the bodies of those that were killed bouldergut is inconsolable and  furious and it takes a few guards to get her to calm down avantika is having a conversation with  a couple of the guards you guys are being pulled away from the docks towards the city as you are  brought towards the /none/ edge of it one of the guards adorned a little better than the rest have a  brief discussion you overhear one of them say hold tight apparently someones going to get the  plank king while you guys are all waiting and youre going to convene with the rest of your troupe  laura im not going to join them  matt but go and find the vicinity  laura see whats going on yeah  matt there are many lookyloos on the edges of the shipyards here the docks make up probably a  good third of darktow /none/ before you actually get the edge of the cliff where the city itself is built  on different areas and platforms and the streets all rise at a perpetual grade as it is embedded  in the side of the cliff there are folks who are looking over to see what happened usually this  kind of stuff does not go down within the city you can see that people are excited and worried  and making up their own stories and what they saw one of them is like it was crazy a demon  fell from the sky /none/ and slammed into the boat and it was intense the rumors are going crazy  marisha it was a gwar concert  matt thats a 7thlevel spell summon gwar concert  laura old man voice did avantika finally do it did she finally do it  sam shes still trying  laura i always heard that she was going to stage a coup did she finally stage one  laughter  taliesin if i can take ten minutes of this time sitting manacled to cast prayer if enough of us  are within 30 feet of each other right now /none/  matt you can probably all they do round you up however as soon as you begin to make any physical  action towards spellcasting  taliesin its all vocal  matt its only verbal  taliesin its only verbal and i tell them  matt you tell them youre going to cast a spell  taliesin im going to be healing everybody its a thing that i  matt no spellcasting  taliesin loud sigh  matt dont want any funny stuff  taliesin all right thats fine  sam have they taken our weapons  matt they have /town/ after manacling taken your weapons the individuals are carrying them at  their side not yours they couldnt find yours  travis i wonder why  matt they have your crossbow and theyve taken your shield and your staff  laura am i within range of everybody could i be in the crowd but near everyone  laughter  matt there is a small perimeter being held but you could get probably within 20 25 feet or so of them  laura then if im within 30 feet im going to cast prayer of healing on my buds  matt /none/ okay  marisha what on your buds  laura on my buddies  matt make a performance check to see how subtly you can no this would be deception make a deception  laura a deception check okay  travis come on  laura eight well i hope those people are going to be okay they look like theyre pretty hurt up in  there some of them look like theyre bloody that one looks burned  matt as you begin to subtly try and sneak your verbal components of your spell into the  discussion one of the guards /none/ goes hey sorry were making sure theres no casting this close to  it if you dont mind  laura makes sense i just saw some were hurt i was trying to help out but if they dont want it  then i aint going to do it  matt its best not to get involved terribly sorry about that  sam i want to hear more  matt nah thats it  liam no it was so good  taliesin this is what you get for counterspell  matt hes telling everyone please hold tight dont worry were taking /none/ care of it  taliesin its just a cheek caress then gone not even a kiss goodnight  matt anyway about 30 or so minutes pass for the rest of you as make your way up the steps now  trying to jaunt you manage to catch up to the armored fellow who now acts as the tip of the  spear essentially now youre flanked and to the front although the flanking has to shift as the  space for the steps ascending to the throne roost get only wide for one person at a time you are  /none/ being held at that point you make your way up to the throne roost to the shelf of stone there you  see standing at the edge is the plank king himself blackened curls still dangling around his  massive goliath head his long coat billowing slightly with the bit of wind thats whipping  around the side of the cliff face the morning fog is burning off of the nearby reefs and you can  see a little bit further out the sky itself is still dull gray looks over and goes that was  quite the display wouldnt /none/ you say the guard goes right sir one of them we found at least  someone running from the bit who says they have information for you he goes oh yeah no i  recognize this one step forward  marisha sup  matt so whats all this  marisha what the display you just saw or this  matt if you dont mind tell me whats going on  marisha i think you just won the lottery friend i toss him the book  matt he flips through the pages this is gibberish  marisha i know luckily one /none/ of our crew members is smart enough and he deciphered the whole  thing in there youll find everything you need to know about the coup that avantika has been  planning whispers about wanting to rule the sea she has been worshipping an outerworldly being  called ukotoa left over from the betrayer gods  matt he glances through the paperwork looks at you giving him this sly grin and goes you  newcomer into these waters spent less than a day amongst our people and have already attacked and  stolen from one of our own as well /none/  marisha i didnt attack she attacked us first  matt well well see what she has to say to defend herself as well hang tight with me here  with these men the rest of you get the rest of your guard bring her friends and bring avantika  and who else had survived that massacre up here to the roost  marisha youre going to trust the things that she says youll see a u burned into the deck of the ship  matt i dont trust anyone and i trust more those that ive mistrusted for years /none/ than those  ive only come to mistrust and know right now so well see where it all lies be patient if what  you say is true then weve got all time in the day  marisha you have time to read that book right now  matt i dont read a fucking piece of this but ive got a few friends who are more of a  pageturning type  marisha hey you came to me though why  matt because i wanted to see if youd actually do something remember we dont turn on pirates here  /none/ marisha what do i get when im right  matt if youre right then ill judge you based on the fact that you broke our law as soon as you  got here and ill weigh it versus how positive this tells me theres not enough well maybe you  and avantika will find yourselves out there on a pike of warning  marisha how about we strike a deal right now because when you go down there youre going to  see murdered crew mates and a u burned into the deck of that ship from where she was /none/ trying to  summon ukotoa  matt make a deception check  sam and laura oh god  liam whispers you crazy motherfucker  marisha 17  matt okay he nods a bit  marisha so if you think you can trust anything that she says before you get into the details of  that book details that weve already deciphered as weve been on the seas with her for quite some  time and the betrayal that we have seen  matt sos this one he snaps his fingers and you see a cloaked figure step out of the /none/ shadows  the same cloak that passed you on the stairs the night before  travis oh right  laura is it jamedi  matt its jamedi hood pulled back  sam is he with us  laura i like jamedi  travis jamedi does not like her  matt at which point the plank king steps up towards you now looming over you a good two and  a half feet of height on you this imposing presence wide like a mountain glancing down at  you with a grin you can smell his early morning breath of rotting /none/ teeth and whatever he had the  night before pulsing from his grin he goes i have to say for someone so small youve got some  serious balls  marisha thanks thats not the first time ive heard that  matt and if you survive im sure it wont be the last all right lets go see your friends  marisha hey i want a boat and safe passage out if were correct  matt if this is right lets hope you didnt blow up too much of her boat itll be yours  marisha deal  matt if /none/ its enough  travis oh god choking  matt the guards now turn and spin you around and push you back down the stairs as the plank king  follows behind jamedi keeping a close watch he goes and shouts something off to the side he  goes solon im going to need your brain for this one come on you hear a voice go all  right im coming  liam and travis solon  matt solon solon coming around the corner you see a human man probably in his late 50s  early 60s bit of an unkept /none/ puff of a chin goatee his hair thinning in this big widows peak gray  to white these big spectacles around his eyes and this tattered thin mustache thats attempted  to be curled into a handlebar but it seems to have split in places and is not very well kept he  has this big green cloak thats wrapped around his shoulders that is so much material and  billowing so widely it makes his head comparatively look much smaller hes clutching a  bag and hes getting his stuff wait here im getting my stuff ugh they keep /none/ walking and  eventually you see him trying to catch up from behind panting you take it this was probably  what the plank king was referring to as his bookish friend  travis you think  liam yeah  travis hes the fighter  matt as you guys are all patiently waiting here looking amongst yourselves is there anything you  wish to do or are you succumbing to the hope that jester beauregard andor possibly the plank king  comes to situate this eventually you see avantika brought up from the ship in manacles as well  liam /none/ well ive noticed that theyre not letting any of us cast anything correct  matt no they shut that down  liam then no i would do mage armor but no  taliesin this is basically a short rest is this what this is  matt its not quite long enough to be a short rest  liam motherfucker  travis i know i was going to say the same thing  matt actually you know what no its about an hour of short rest i give that to you  travis bless you mercer  matt for the travel /none/ of beau to the front and the rest of the guard to get there for the plank king  conversation for him to descend the throne roost to make his way through the city to the docks  yeah thats over an hour  liam then in these circumstances i would dismiss frumpkin from the material plane and bring him  back on my shoulder so hes with me  matt okay as frumpkin appears on the shoulder one of the watch goes oh whered you come from  little one didnt even see you come in begins scritching frumpkin /town/  liam hes friendly thats my pet cat  matt doesnt even talk to you just looks at frumpkin whos a cute little kitty we dont get  cats much on this island its good to see one wonder what ship you came aboard  laughter  liam im thinking really bad thoughts  matt eventually as the crowd begins to part you see a number of the guard a few of the bodyguards  that you had seen previously sitting amongst the shadows of the throne roost when you first arrived  the night before you guys came roaring /town/ into this town you definitely did there you see beauregard  being flanked by three guards one betterarmored than the others and then there stepping behind  that the looming figure of the plank king he approaches so not here but 24 hours and youve  already made a mess of our little home have you i could see the flames from my roost my crows  men tell me they spotted you walking aboard the squalleater and assault avantika one of our own  apparently a few of you fleeing into the city you know i have my misgivings /none/ about trusting anyone  but im far more likely to toss in with those that ive mistrusted long enough to at least know where  they stand i dont know a fucking bit about all of you so my other friend and he points  towards jamedi whos now in the back and the rest of you see  says that youve all come in  with her lot naught but maybe two weeks back and that not most of you have much of an experience on  the sea naught but one the rest of you still havent quite /none/ found your legs on the waters im  going to ask you right now what brought you out there to mucking with the pirates deals speak up  travis we understand your distrust we are new here and we only beg your patience as we prove  ourselves before you avantika and her crew were up to foul deeds our friend beau here i trust  has shown you her journal  matt he reaches back in his pocket and goes oh right here and gives it to solon who goes  oh all right this is not a language /none/ i really know  marisha theres a cipher in the front  matt oh yeah  liam yeah its wedged into the back page  matt he takes it and pulls it out looks at it oh fuck me this is  marisha yeah its pretty good work right  matt sir with all due respect its going to take me a long while to do this this is elaborate  marisha i told you yeah  taliesin i think theres already some work that can be checked if that speeds it up i mean that  should be  /none/ matt the plank king goes shh  taliesin oh yeah  matt you said theres some special parts here of looking to overturn me or something what pages  are that at  liam excuse me i am the one who deciphered this that is near the end  marisha hes our solon  matt solon goes oh id very much like to have a conversation with you  liam as you will if that is welcome here but yeah the bit about her being a traitor to the  plank king and wanting to rule over the entire sea /none/ and have the plank king i believe the words  are if i remember correctly because my memory is spotty bend the knee  matt you point out the space where that was  liam is near the end ja right here  matt thumbs through and he goes  liam its complex  matt okay o great king give me a bit of time with this if you dont mind he looks around  everyones looking at him at this moment he glances around and sees the dozens and dozens of  eyes locked on him and he starts /none/ getting a little nervous you see a little sweat drop on his  forehead and he adjusts his glasses again theyre starting to fog a bit he goes clears  throat plops down and starts going through and pulls out paper and a quill he sets up in the  middle of the dock area and starts going through and pointbypoint deciphering and translating  each part of the cipher over to one of his empty pages  travis great king if we may time we have  matt that we do  travis its at your whim that we /none/ serve i think it would be only fair to ask that we remain under  guard while your compatriot here translates that text  matt oh were standing right here  travis fair enough  matt you still havent answered my question what brought you to these waters whyd you throw  in with her lot you see now theyre bringing avantika forward with the rest of you  marisha well were from wildemount hired mercenaries from the empire im with a secret  order of the monks from the cobalt soul known as the expositors avantika has been a /none/ person of  interest that weve been wanting to investigate for some time and i was sent to do that so  unfortunately our business has nothing to do with you fine folk here of darktow it only has to deal  with avantika shes disrupted our shores enough we decided to investigate  matt where does your allegiance lie  marisha my allegiance is completely separate and isolated from any persons here my allegiance is  with the cobalt soul  matt his eyes narrow make a deception check ill say with advantage because you did drop the  /none/ cobalt soul in particular with the plank king that has meaning  liam i would like to read her as well  matt insight check  liam at disadvantage  matt yes for you  marisha 22  matt the plank king nods and goes  marisha my voice is shaking im so nervous  liam 22 for me  matt yeah you barely see through theres a hint of truth and theres a hint of not so true its  a halftruth  liam caleb sees it go away fjord go away  marisha mixed lies or halftruths  /none/ matt the plank king nods and goes ah the archives ive had some dealings  marisha hmm so you have your library card  matt not much of a reader but your folk have done good work for our interests in the past so  its the woman of the hour what have you to say about yourself when these strangers have come  waltzing into our little haven and causing all sorts of ruckus murdering your crew and making  these claims against you known you for years avantika hand behind in shackles goes well  her face you /none/ can see bits where dirt sweat lines have made their way across and down the sides of  her chin and jaw looking intently at the rest of you with a forced smile through her teeth there  is a look of murderous rage and loss in her eyes as you have murdered a majority of her crew she  goes well i can guarantee that i kept no journal they came to me at sea with discussion of  perhaps coming and joining my crew looking for means of aid and gold they began to talk of this  /none/ strange entity this ukotoa well i followed suit i wanted to make for some kind of alliance  i found particular interest with one of their individuals she looks over towards fjord but  it seems such a romance was merely just another way to try and toss me to the proverbial wolves  or merrow if it will theyve now killed my crew theyve taken a number of my things damaged my  ship and theyre trying to smear my name one who has walked alongside you and all of you fine fine  folks for the past ten /town/ years even using the memory of vandren against me you hear a few  voices go like murmuring vandren vandren raised this one and he sabotaged his ship blew it  asunder in the middle of the ocean that was the last he was seen hes already killed one of our  own is this untrue  travis stuttering is she talking to me  matt yeah  laura from the crowd im going to go shes lying we always knew she had it in for the plank king  matt someone goes shh all eyes are on you  /none/ travis plank king if i may my ears though pointy can only stand a certain amount of  dishonesty i would prefer to cut through the bull there are those of us among us who can make  sure that the truth is spoken here i would beg of you to allow that to happen now  matt make a persuasion check  travis natural 20  cheering  matt the plank king gives you this very severe look his eyes narrowed and glancing you up and  down almost piercing you with but a glance he raises his hand /none/ with a grin and goes oh whats  necessary for such a thing  travis whispering who has that shit  marisha i do and jester does  travis you do  marisha yeah it takes me literally punching the shit out of avantika though  travis honorable plank king the means justify the ends my compatriot here will place her cobalt  knuckles upon the chin of avantika and you will hear the truth you need but only ask your  questions again  matt be my guest avantika is like what is  marisha before she double punch /dung/  laughter  matt shes manacled and being held by two guards from behind its autohit  liam holy shit  marisha go for the temple  matt do you have a ki point left  marisha yeah i have all of my ki points left more or less all but one yep  matt all right whats the dc on that  marisha mine im assuming which is 14 hang on features and traits  matt yeah whatever your dc is for all of your monk stuff  liam sam and travis whispering monk stuff  marisha yeah 14 /none/  matt okay its a wisdom save no thats a natural eight plus four 12 so all these  different hits and pressure points are hit like under the chin that area another to the sternum  and another that clocks the temple and avantika just ugh heavy breathing  marisha they are unable to speak a deliberate lie for one minute and all charisma checks have advantage  matt intimidation checks oh charisma checks yeah persuasion everything else thats right yeah  liam mein gott  travis make sure you tell the plank king its a limited time engagement /none/  matt shes like ugh  marisha you have 60 seconds but i have more knuckles  matt the plank king steps forward avantika is what theyre saying true she goes frustrated  grunt glances aside doesnt respond he leans forward closer tell me  liam whispering silence speaks volumes though  matt is what theyre saying true is that book containing passages where youre looking to take  this island for yourself her eyes look away she just looks down at the rest of the dock he leans  in real close pushing his forehead almost to hers look /none/ me in the eye woman  marisha oh my god  matt she just doesnt meet his gaze hmm by the power of the revelry that surrounds me let this  be a lesson to those who would work against the words we swore to each other on this land may  your memory be besmirched for the few days its recalled he reaches forward and grabs avantika  by the throat and lifts her up and shes fighting against it he lifts her and looks at her i hope  your sea god whatever it is is very merciful /none/ on the other side cracking he breaks her neck  with one hand her body goes limp in his grasp and he throws it to the docks dont worry about the  cipher solon goes its actually quite interesting id like to continue fine  liam i worked through the night on that its very interesting  matt and its really well done im honestly very taken aback by it your penmanship is quite  good as well  liam breakfast  sam i have a sample of her penmanship here if you want to see some more of it /none/  matt oh certainly he goes and starts taking it at this point the plank king goes take her  up top shell be the next on the pike as for the rest of you youve pulled out a conspiracy ill  give you that youve also snuck your way into the revelry under false pretenses youve broken our  laws within but a day of being presented with them in multiple ways thats a serious offense  so hear my judgment upon these folk you are hereby banished from darktow take the remnants of  the squalleater as your /none/ own take whatever he looks over towards the rest of the crew you hired  who are like panicked panting  travis laughter those poor fuckers  matt they have had a terrible few weeks here except for orly whos sitting there smoking a  pipe and his one eye goes  travis stonecold killer  liam he is so stoned  matt take the ship youve thereby damaged limp your way beyond the reefs were going to burn the  colors of that ship should you ever return to the outskirts of the dragshallow we wont hesitate  but /none/ sink you to the depths below  travis that is beyond a generous sentence  matt unshackle them this stands immediately i hope you have enough supplies in that boat to last  you the rest of the journey  sam whispering i dont think that we do  taliesin well be fine  travis well make do we will leave with great haste  matt good tell the archives that the plank king sends his regards  marisha will do good sir  matt now fucking go  laura before everybody gets on the boat can i run over /none/ to the docks because im not shackled  and i try to find the jewels that i dumped off the docks  matt okay you have to dive into the water to do so  laura okay  matt so you jump into the water make an investigation no thisll be a perception check  with disafuckingvantage  sam disafuckingvantage  matt yeah  laura ooh laughter  taliesin wow fuck you  laura two ones  liam you counterbalanced the rest of this game  taliesin fucking belly flop into the water  travis sin eater  sam two /none/ ones in a roll  liam has that happened since the walk of shame  laura no  liam two years ago  matt you spend the next five or so minutes scrounging through silt and muck and barnacles and  gathered bits of kelp and various other underwater plant life that has rooted itself among the rocks  here youve scraped your fingers theyre bleeding from digging through you find a cluster  of these gems that you dropped and you climb up out of the freezing water and find one of the  nearby ladders and come up /none/ looking at your quarry it is a bunch of rocks  taliesin come on jester lets  matt oh you dont see jester you just see an old prospector come up  taliesin thats right  travis youre a prospector  laura these are beautiful rocks beautiful  matt you guys are ushered to the squalleater your crew is ushered to the squalleater  sam oh the mist is gone the mistake  matt the mistake is still in repairs and at this point has been left behind  liam ja we will take the bigger boat  travis avantikas /none/ crew are still manacled up  matt the remained of them yes bouldergut is heavily manacled and is currently guarded by seven  different guards  marisha should we try to take them  travis no maybe one or two of them ipess  laura what theyre going to hate us  liam no  travis what weve got to have somebody to kill while were at sea  liam no  sam yeah we have our crew  liam we have our crew we do not need them  taliesin yeah weve got a way  marisha yeah we /none/ know how to sail now  travis better yeah and they do  matt all right as you guys get on the ship with your crew the ship is damaged the sails are  damaged one of the masts is damaged its going to need some repairs for it to be fully  functional but you have to leave now  marisha yeah lets go  matt you take your positions at the ship pull up the anchor and make your way limping through the  channel of dragshallow reef back out towards the swavain islands the lucidian ocean as /none/ you slowly  make your way with what little bit of wind you can pick up to bring you out there some of the sails  are still working so youre not fully damaged but youre not optimal there are a series of  these what are referred to as the war posts that are the clusters of driftwood and these towers  that are set up along the reef and on top of the various reefs that are shallow or breach the  actual surface that have cannons attached that have flares set up and beacons that can be /none/ lit to  alert darktow you get a better look this time of the system they have to defend this island from  the clovis concord and anybody else that would look to make their way via ship to this island  you can see them at the ready keeping a very close eye on your exit as you slowly walk of shame  yourselves out of the purview of the plank king and to a very carefully earned freedom  travis if i may who is really good at finding shit you two and anyone  marisha like investigation /none/ style  travis yeah how about you three into avantikas quarters and turn it upside down  marisha ooh you are turning me on right now  travis not my intention but go ahead  marisha yes  travis okay  travis just in case she booby trapped this ship search the hull search her quarters search everything  marisha yeah check for traps first okay  liam ill be doing that at disadvantage  taliesin im going to try and calm the crew a little bit  matt okay  taliesin ill point out that were this is all /none/ good we got away from the pirates everythings all right  matt make a general persuasion check for me just a persuasion check  taliesin thats 15  matt okay you do a number of the crew that you hired some of them look like theyre a little  scarred from the experience but you managed to calm them down they seem very thankful that  youve pulled them you brought them into this mess but you pulled them out of it and theres  something to that some of them begin to get back to work begin to repair /none/ some of the aspects of  the ship man  travis is jester able to mend some of those damaged  laura thats what i was going to try to do yeah anything thats small enough im going to try to  mend small holes  liam 20 percent of the damage  laura yeah  matt there are a few places but for the most part and its only the one mast you still have  enough sails because its a threemast ship you can still coast the winds but its not going to  be optimal speed youll /none/ have to get back to some sort of a port to get the rest of the sails  repaired because you dont have replacement sails the downside of the fireball the fireball and  the actually it was a 20foot tall wall of fire  liam yes but the upside was so  matt it was  sam then you singed the other sails too  matt yeah theres a lot of sail you have  liam yeah 20 feet tall for six to 12 seconds that didnt last more than two rounds  matt i know but thats a /none/ very intense  liam absolutely  matt i would say comparatively youre limping on one full mast of functionality and the rest of  the sails are partially damaged  liam gasps pigeon coos paint on the mast  laura pigeon coo i was thinking about it but its a lot of the use of the paint because  sam pigeon coo how about a few sails  taliesin we dont have to pigeon this i mean we know what you can do so maybe paint the fix for it  matt just so you know  laura thats what /none/ i want i dont want to paint the whole thing  matt just so you know this ship travels on an average pace of around 48 miles a day right now  with the damage the sails have sustained youre close to 20 youre less than half speed on the  ship with the damage its sustained at the sails its going to take you a while to get anywhere  but you have it  laura how big are the holes are they giant  matt theyre beyond mending  laura okay  matt mending can do little tears /none/ and things  laura no im not talking mending im talking how big are the holes  matt for the ones that are damaged the sails are mostly destroyed they caught fire and burned  liam i have a question if i finally go to bed for like 14 hours minor alchemy for a  transmutation wizard i am able to perform an alchemical procedure on one object composed  entirely of wood stone iron copper silver and transform it into another material if there was  damage to the mast would i be able to shove other things in /none/ there and turn it to wood that seems  like too much  matt doesnt quite work that way and its temporary its more  liam its a spell that i couldve done but i didnt take that spell i chose counterspell  matt to be fair i think that worked in your favor if tonight has proved anything if the end  of the last campaign has proved anything counterspells always a good choice  taliesin were going to spend a day moving slowly but i think were going to slowly figure  out how between all of us /none/ we can repair this and im sure we can figure out where to get some cloth  marisha this just turned into a resource management game  taliesin yeah its a lot different kind of game  matt you guys have now pushed into the rest of the seafaring mist it takes you a while to move  beyond the dragshallow reef the better part of the day before you escape the channel at the pace  youre moving the clouds are pretty heavy now the open sky that you enjoyed on your way to  darktow has now become /none/ not a storm front by any means but definitely cloudier skies as youre  heading outside you can see yasha smelling the air and be like this might be getting close to  storm weather  travis is that a good thing  matt she smiles  travis its a good thing  matt continuing past into that space repairs are being done best you can with the ship still  limping along you make your way out of the dragshallow reef out into open waters and the  ocean is yours  travis can i find orly  matt /none/ yeah  travis ill bring out the map  matt bring out the map  travis i dont have it near me  laura should we get close to a port or something  taliesin or an island where we  travis do we know where the map is please  sam singing bring out the map  matt its usually right there it got moved for honey heist thats why oh is it down there oh  there it is it got hidden it got moved from me  travis damn it bobby  matt damn it bobby there /none/ you go  liam i sell falchions and  marisha im having an adrenaline crash now  liam yeah we survived and  marisha are those little zoomy magnifying glasses  liam theyre magnifying matt whered you get those  marisha the crew got them that was max thanks producer max  travis do we know if we are making our way  matt you guys have just managed to make your way out of here  sam oh going the wrong way  liam so were going right into her vagina  matt well that is the wildmother she /none/ is nature i guess  travis ill tell orly orly if you could help us plot a course as damaged as we are heading north  to this point  laura shouldnt we get to a port or something before we  sam yeah we need to repair first  liam there aint no fucking port around here motherfucker  sam well maybe theres something over here he knows about something lets ask orly mmmaybe  travis wow  liam max headroom coming at you from the mid80s wwwhat  matt its a good thing i grew up a stutterer /none/  liam yeah matt is just barely old enough to know what that is  matt oh i know max headroom  liam i said you know what it is just barely  matt its funny i didnt realize who played him until years later and i was like really him  travis wait who played him  matt oh whats the actor  liam he was in the stand as the trashcan man  matt he was and he played the part of jobe in lawnmower man 2 anyway  travis because this is on a trade run and /none/ this whole isle is part of that could we make port for  more extensive repairs there  matt its a resource stop it might have some repairs in your experience its not a major port  by any means its more of a small  travis resupply  matt yeah its a resupply  laura might have canvas at least  taliesin we can use divination  travis thats the closest thing  matt from your experience  travis divination what do you mean  taliesin if its been 24 hours once i have a long rest i can /none/ take my morning meditation and  ask the wildmother if theres a place of calm for our boat  laura you can do that  taliesin i can do a lot of stuff man  travis i would love to have you do that  liam are you doing that  taliesin i was going to do that yeah  matt to answer your question orly goes yeah theres a way to get that working for you well  all take course and head for that mmmighty dangerous part of the sea he marks it and they  set it /none/ you guys have been making your way around the dragshallow northward towards that area  sam is that past where were going  travis it is but we dont have any other  taliesin yeah in the early morning im going to go to the crows nest and have a tenminute  meditation and ask the wildmother which direction we should be heading to find some safe harbor to  heal ourselves and heal our boat  matt okay is this an ability or  taliesin yes it is a 4thlevel spell its divination  matt oh there we go /none/  taliesin im using it it takes ten minutes and you can be as obtuse as you like you can be a  bird that flies in a direction an insect or whatever  travis thank you for the shawshank obtuse reference  matt okay yeah the wildmother responds actually let me see what will be the best answer  to this one give me just a second stage whisper talk amongst yourselves  taliesin i was seeing if there was anything else i can do im setting day two spells so well  have food and water  liam /none/ if were talking about like business shit caleb is going to beau and saying im sorry i  know that this has been less than ten days but i need my cat so i am taking my owl i apologize  on a side note so impressed i walk off with my little tiny oneounce owl  marisha bye frumpkin  liam i will take the time to turn frumpkin i have two uses left with incense back into a  bengal cat so he can live his best life as a bengal cat  sam imitating liams accent bengal /none/ cat  liam diplomatic catmunity  matt you get that situated anybody else doing anything  laura im going to  matt your answer by the way is bisaft isle brings you safest harbor in what you seek  taliesin and sam bisaft  matt theres a warm gentle embrace that comes with the words an understanding and a familiar  matronly guidance that brings you calm on the ocean seas that have long brought you anxiety for  the first time in probably a good number of weeks you get to walk out on that deck take a deep /none/  breath of ocean air and feel really confident  taliesin sea smells different today might just be the charred boat and oh no bisaft  travis you look rejuvenated did you say bisaft  taliesin bisaft were to head towards bisaft  travis youre sure  taliesin sure as anything  travis all right then you can let orly know  taliesin orly  matt mmhmm  taliesin know the isle of bisaft  matt oh im quite familiar  taliesin that seem to be the direction were heading right now  matt about as close as any direction /none/ gets really other eye even  taliesin i think that might be the place we ought to go  matt making it jump around a bit guys mm very well mmmake sure to point this ship in that direction  taliesin thank you  matt and you  sam on the first day we were on this boat me and beau and others were going to go into avantikas  cabin and snoop around  liam oh right i rolled an 18 and a 19 ten minutes ago  marisha i dont know if i rolled i dont think i /none/ did  sam i didnt roll yet either but i was going to crawl in through the hole in her floor if its  still there  matt oh its still there  sam to avoid any traps and then look around the door from the inside to see if she had trapped it  or anything  matt okay make an investigation check on that  sam 20 19  matt no it is not trapped  sam ill open it and let you guys in  liam i rolled an investigation check ten minutes ago at disadvantage and /none/ the lower is a 27 my  investigation is plus eight im smart  matt the lower was 19  liam yes i rolled an 18 and a 19  sam well ill show caleb around the room that ive already been in to see if he can find  anything else  marisha im in there too  matt glancing around you find theres her dresser with a number of outfits coats shirts  things that belong to the captain that you guys get to distribute as you see fit  laura cartoon voice hey look at me im /none/ avantika  liam are there any more gigantic hats  marisha i was going to say teddies but  matt theres a few hats yeah  liam gigantic hats  matt avantikasized hats  marisha and taliesin singing hats and teddies hats hats and teddies  laughter  sam does she have a fragrance or anything like a perfume  marisha chanel no 5  matt i will say you do find some scented oils but thats the extent  sam ill take those  matt shes not a perfume keeper  taliesin how about that statue above the door /none/  laura yeah her little altar  matt the altar is still there the altar to ukotoa  marisha the maps the stuff behind her charting out where she was going anything in there  matt yeah you find a few other maps and things that refer to a you see it breaking down the  different trade routes and you see other paths breaking out those that try and avoid the trade  routes to avoid the pirates those different paths they might take at different times of the year to  try and head off people that are /none/ trying to avoid the waters that theyre looking in you find maps  that deal with the path to urukayxl and you see the handwritten map by jamedi that was the path  you guys were lead through on urukayxl to find the temple you find another map that has circled  heavily the archipelago that youve already sussed out and you find recent notes on that same map  that refer to the loose area circled where your ship went down that time ago  travis will we pass over that area as were heading towards bisaft  matt /none/ well youll get near that area if you want to head that way you can let orly know to  marisha its on the way  liam are you in this room with us too right now  travis no im just asking  matt you find a lot of those materials you get the sense that aside from the maps most of the  information that she had she kept in that book  marisha any supplies list any inventory canvas on board things to make supplies  matt you find a number of fine cheeses actually  marisha /none/ chocolate dipped strawberries champpagnay  matt not quite all the good food was kept for the captain and some of its turning a little but  its cheese some better treats and some sugared candies that were kept specifically like a  private stash for the captain you manage to find  sam while were down there looking around im going to say so you know its just the three of  us down here  liam yeah im sitting on the bed right now  sam we have some secrets between us already  marisha yeah its been a /none/ while since just the three of us have been in a room together  liam wait a second look at me im sitting on the bed i am the servant of a demigod this is  going to be very hard for fjord  sam yes well  marisha what youre jumping around so much  liam we can get back to what youre talking about but think about it for a moment its just  the three of us right we have our heads in the same game we are the three assholes in this  group yeah  /none/ sam im asshole adjacent  marisha shes quite pleasant actually  liam that is correct  marisha she might be better than both of us combined  liam im joking because this has been such a hard day but fjord is going to find this very difficult  sam were going to protect him like we always do  marisha which part difficult losing his fuck buddy its not that difficult  liam that is minimalizing what he is dealing with right now he is trying to find a father he has  compromised himself with this woman for us /none/ for himself for all of our safety it is going to be  difficult for him  marisha of course its minimalizing have you met me everything i do is minimalizing  liam you have your pluses and your minuses  sam speaking of your pluses the expositors youre special forces did i hear that correctly  is that what you are called  marisha yeah  sam is that true it seemed pretty true  marisha yeah what caleb said  liam its mostly true  sam what do you mean how do you know  marisha yeah how /none/ do you know  liam she is too educated she is too intheknow to talk the way she does to be interested in just  drinking and chasing our barbarian friend she is very educated i dont know which parts are true  sam well which parts are true  marisha you want to take a guess  sam i think youre a secret agent i think youre on a dangerous mission a life or death mission  to find bad guys and take them down to get the collar and bring them in to the popo or  something /none/ i dont know how it works im not a secret agent you are  marisha its very romanticized but on that note caleb do you think you could recreate that cipher  that you made and have one on hand  liam of course that is easy  marisha id like a copy if you dont mind  liam sure what are friends for  sam do you have a license to kill  marisha got them right here nott just these no that wasnt working no all right yeah its  a little true but not as intense as /none/ you think  sam are there others like you  marisha monks  sam no like  marisha expositors  sam yeah delta force  marisha yes  sam how do you know whos who do you have a sign secret handshake  marisha kind of new to it all to be honest  sam you guys are really cool  liam no i am looking forward to getting back to the mainland and i dont mean the menagerie  coast although we need to get jester back to her mother if we can but i am not looking forward /none/  to being here anymore i want to get back to the empire  marisha speaking of time that it takes to travel are we sure that avantika was the only one who was  interested in what ukotoa has to offer  liam well there is still vandren i have read every inch of her notes i have communicated them to you  marisha i guess what im saying is are we still going to be competing against others once the  plank king successfully deciphers that book  liam i would imagine the plank king would not know /none/ what to make of it it clearly damns her it  does not give him enough information he wouldnt know what to do with it  marisha it does kind of sound like a wives tale  liam yeah hes not a big thinker he is formidable but not a big thinker i think we will  have an easier time getting to this boat  marisha lets go talk about it with the others i think  sam your secret is safe with me  laura above deck can i go find fjord  matt yeah  laura so /none/ that happened giggles  travis yeah  laura how do you feel about it  travis relieved  laura yeah  travis yeah i was worried for a moment there i knew it was going to come to something like that  but caleb pulling the trigger the way he did was  laura did he cause that explosion  travis yeah  laura wow  travis right  laura he did a lot of damage  travis he did hes very strong  laura so now were going to find the place where your ship wrecked yeah  travis /none/ i think so yeah  laura you didnt get to ask them about vandren though  travis no i didnt it hurts to see so many react to a name that only meant so much to me  but i dont even know if hes alive we might find him down there  laura wow do you think if we find him youll stop talking like him  travis well see  laura you know i could probably send a message to the plank king and ask him about vandren if  you want me to  travis what do /none/ you mean  laura well i can send him a message the same way i try to talk to my mama and the gentleman and  kiri sometimes  travis you send messages to kiri  laura yeah  travis what do you say  laura oh just that shes really cute and that i miss her and i wish i could see her and i hope  shes enjoying herself and that i am sorry that we havent seen each other in a while and that we  are pirates and  travis can she respond to these messages /none/  laura she

back together  matt its going to take you about a week to get to the location that youre seeking  marisha the boat /none/ or the island  travis the island  matt no the islands going to take longer than that to get to where the last time you recall  your ship going down  marisha with our shit all fucked up  matt yeah it would take a shorter time its about eight days or so to get there eyeballing it  from here id say more than that ten days  laura can we cast control water to get us there faster at all  matt do you have access to control water  laura of course i do  /none/ travis and liam you do  matt then yeah  liam oh fuck  laura maybe i can do that every day  matt okay ill say with the control water  travis fucking secrets  taliesin i was about to say i might be able to do that too  sam

list yeah  marisha its a cleric /none/ oh god d4 just went flying  matt between the two of you it allows you a brief moment where you can actually surge the  water and grant you a speed boost id say thatll cut three days off of your travel the two of  you each day spending that slot to push it its like a speedboat burst all of a sudden your  giant threemast ship is going crashing water speedboating across the ocean briefly  marisha is it an event each day does the crew come out and we all join like yeah  taliesin /none/ its like in mary poppins everyone holds the china  marisha exactly  taliesin and 12 oclock  marisha and lets go  liam youre so stupid rose  matt eventually you make your way to the open waters in the vicinity of orly goes with you  each day and looks about and gives you the onceover and goes im pretty sure that were  pretty dang close to that place you were asking about  travis i appreciate that orly hey caduceus do you have any way of i dont know youve got  those vibes right feeling /none/ down and i dont know doing a little ping on the bottom  taliesin what do you i dont entirely understand what youre  travis i dont know i dont want to put you in a box or anything but you seem to pick up the most  taliesin you want to see if i get oh for the ship i dont know thats a  laura thatd be a locate object sort of situation  taliesin ive got locate creature yeah weve both got locate object so we can both help with that  sam what object  laura /none/ a ship  travis ill summon the falchion and ill say maybe try to locate this and ill point towards  the eye not this eye but a similar eye  liam do you mean your penis  travis nope  laura im going to do it  matt okay its a thousandfoot range and it has to be something familiar to you  taliesin im looking for a boat im looking for a ship im looking for a shipwreck not an  object we could do object too  laura yeah im going to look for his  matt /none/ okay thats 2ndlevel it lasts for ten minutes  taliesin so we can take turns  matt okay and how many spell slots do you have 2ndlevel each  laura three each  matt so if youre both trading off its about three chances per type of use per day how many  days you want to spend looking total  marisha for the boat  matt yeah  travis how long do we have  matt its up to you  sam do we have unlimited supplies  matt well these guys can summon stuff with magic if i /none/ recall  taliesin yeah so the food aint good but its edible and the waters fine  marisha until we find it  travis yeah what like two days and then go fix the boat proper and come back if we have to  marisha i dont know maybe thats a team discussion  travis how about we spend two to three days and if we dont find it we can go and repair the boat  proper or at least get the materials to do that  taliesin we can cast it at level three also which is another /none/  sam if we find it though and we go down there we cant go down there can we go down there  travis sure we can  sam but then we cant make a hasty retreat  laura yeah it might be smart to have a boat that actually works before we go down  sam i guess we could do a recon first  marisha there still begs the question of is someone else going to come looking for this now  that the plank king  taliesin i like that were here now  marisha we gave /none/ the book with the cipher over so if anybody else wants it  laura yeah but we ripped out the page saying where to find  marisha we did oh my god  liam all the pertinent information is also in here  travis nott i would leave it at your discretion we all have the ability to travel under the waves  with great ease  sam we do how i dont  travis i have a way of making it so that water becomes like air for you down there  sam does it feel like water  /none/ travis it feels a little thicker like if you were in a really dense fog maybe  sam but its still water  travis it is  laura but you can breathe it so its really not  travis or you could stay above if you wanted to send a message if some trouble appears on the  horizon id just hate to leave you behind on such a great adventure there could be buttons there  could be little jewels ingots  sam dont you talk down to me i know what youre up to  travis what are /none/ you talking about iits the bottom of the ocean ships throw people all the time  liam full disclosure i could help you cope with  sam he thinks im going to go into the water for some fucking buttons  travis i heard tell there was a button ship that crashed right along the water  sam oh the old button ship legend really oh buttonbeard the pirate  travis yep  sam he had buttons for beards  liam nott the brave we have things to accomplish here if you allow me i could do what i have /none/ done  in the past a little sneakily to help you cope with this fear you have if you allow me  sam i appreciate that caleb but ive got my own way of doing it  liam is it mike myers  travis there might be bronzed shoes maybe little silver cups decoder rings  sam ooh those spoons the little spoons the collectible ones fuck this guy  liam were not there yet though were talking in advance at this point all in advance  laura yeah  travis were coming upon the area right  matt altogether /none/ with the eight of them it cuts the travel time down to five days so youve got time  sam ill think about it  taliesin im going to be stocking us up on food too so that theres more than enough food and  water for the whole group  sam pewter plates those little collectible plates from the stanford mint or whatever  laura so were going to hang around this area before we get to the boat wrecks yeah  travis yeah i think so  laura okay  matt okay so taking your time i would /none/ like you to each to roll a base wisdom check for each pass  as you go through  sam you two right  matt yes d20 plus your wisdom modifier  taliesin 19  laura 12  matt okay again  laura god nine  taliesin oh im doing save im so sorry fuck i was doing

first day hitting this space and scanning the load  laura 15  taliesin 14  matt okay and youre utilizing your memory of passage through here as well as orlys direction  on this ocean go ahead and roll an intelligence check for me  travis 13  matt okay first day goes through nothing catches your attention you pass around and then  once you make it quite past the area based on the measurements where you think that you recall it  happening the next day you make a curved turn and begin to head out /none/ to see some more land as  you can to widen the perspective of your search for the second day roll again  taliesin three  matt three in a row yeah unless you want to use more spell slots to do more so you can do your  3rdlevel to burn as well  laura thats true 20 on the first roll  taliesin 20 on the first roll  laura lame on the second roll  taliesin 14 on the second roll  matt sneezes pardon me thank you sneezes pardon thank you  sam youre a threesneezer /none/  matt i am at least  laura

check for you as well  marisha come on  liam fuhjordy  travis 11  matt okay you go through the second day and towards the end you caduceus sense a brief  moment where something shiprelated catches your attention and then is gone  taliesin i had /none/ a moment  travis you did  taliesin yeah its gone now would i know direction even  matt vague direction  taliesin but were moving i know  matt yeah youre moving so its like all right lets go ahead and turn it around  sam just point caleb will know the direction  matt you turn the ship back in the direction of where it goes at the very end of the second day  just as dusk is starting to creep in you make your way back in the area and you sense another hit  laura /none/ ooh should i use another 3rdlevel spell and try to find the orby thing  taliesin lets do one more  matt okay as youre attempting to find the orb roll a wisdom check  taliesin ill also join in for one more for that as well its my last spell slot  matt okay you lose your concentration on the locate object  taliesin oh okay im still holding the boat thats fine  matt you circle around again youve closed off a distance but you havent quite located the  specific area yet youre trying to guide into /none/ a vicinity i mean its hard to really remember  specifically where when its just open water and a storm looming especially so you get to a  certain point where youre like im not sure im being able to help but youre starting to get  something youre not entirely sure the divination seems to be helping or this aspect of  your locate spell evening comes to a close you ride the night out the clouds are still thick  the next morning you can attempt again if you like both of you  travis come on you /none/ got it  sam bless or something do a bless  laura i dont have bless  sam no he does  taliesin i do  laura bless us  matt make another intelligence check for me as well  taliesin actually this is a check not a save so it wouldnt  laura oh and i want to learn the cantrip guidance but i dont know any good healers that  can teach it to me  marisha druids can teach it too  laura 18  taliesin 15  travis 20  matt okay roll again  sam /none/ one last one  matt this is your second spell slot used today  taliesin 19  laura motherfuck im going to use a third  taliesin that was my third was 19  matt okay  laura 21  matt okay between the 21 and your 20 intellect in guiding the ship around you find yourself now  collecting a secondary blip once again on the ship not on the eye  laura i was on the orb  matt youre concentrating on the orb or the ship  laura i was concentrating on the ball  matt the /none/ ball you find nothing  travis i think that means its probably not down there but id still like to take a look  liam are we close what are you telling us  travis i think so were starting to round an area that i think we could probably fan out and  explore amongst the seven of us  liam i just got my cat back but if you want an octopus to look on the bottom you have it  taliesin thats a very good idea  travis that is actually if it wouldnt be too much /none/ trouble caleb that would be  liam yeah i have just enough incense to yeah sure lets make an octopus catshaped an  octopusshaped cat  marisha oh wow how far does your octopus connection go for  liam well i can tell him to go look and hell come back to me i can see through him for  marisha yeah but how far is your connection  liam its a thousand feet to watch but he can go and come back and i trust him hes frumpkin  i pull out my book and i set it on /none/ the deck and i start working on turning my cat into an octopus  sam does this mean we dont have to go in the water  taliesin oh this means well probably have to go in the water  sam what why hes got an octopus  liam an hour later an octopus pops out if we wait that long  travis yeah id be okay with it  matt so you create a frumpkin octopus  liam yeah sighs well we had one or two days together just throw him off  matt splashing frumpkin makes his way /none/ in the darkness  taliesin im also going to put bless on the octopus before it  matt okay how long does it last  taliesin its one minute  liam so ill watch for the first thousand feet but i assume he goes beyond that because its the  ocean so he keeps going down and down and down i will tell him to look for this wreck for what we  are looking for and when he finds it to come back and tell me about it  matt okay make a perception check for frumpkin  liam /none/ 13  matt okay about an hour goes by nothing roll again  liam 17  matt frumpkin goes beyond your visual range for a bit you start getting worried and then frumpkin  returns and is making his way quickly towards the ship  liam if hes within 1000 we have a connection  matt 100foot is the connection  liam a hundred thank you  marisha maybe hell see dashilla  liam maybe its 10000  matt technically the distance doesnt matter for what you can see through his eyes its a 100 feet  for it to /none/ communicate  liam right weve established that i can see indefinitely thats what we established early in  the campaign with the circus but i cant communicate with him  matt correct during that time so yeah you watch through frumpkins eyes as he makes his way  toward the finally finding the floor of this ocean over this second hour of his search he  catches one shape that is emerging like an obelisk on the bottom of the ocean upon getting close  enough you can see it looks to be the front of a wrecked ship itself /none/ damaged and caked in  minerals ocean floor plant life barnacles it appears to be a damaged ship  sam does it have a name  liam i dont hear any of you  sam shouting does it have a name  marisha youre in my ear ow  sam sorry  liam ooh he has found the ship this is a reminder i cant hear any of you i dont want to  disconnect dont give me wet willies  laura i give him a wet willie  sam six wet willies  travis his ears are just dripping /none/ saliva  matt and laura groaning  matt okay frumpkin does a circle on it before feeling confident that hes discovered at least  something of interest and then beelines it back to the squalleater  liam whos a good boy you are the best cat that was ever put on this planet  matt then frumpkin is now there at the surface of the water without really a way getting back into  the ship  liam oh yeah  matt yeah there you go back in your shoulder  liam oh come here you you are the most /none/ important member of this team and dont let  beauregard tell you different or nott  marisha do you ever feel like your relationship with your cat is hindering building stronger  relationships with human people  sam ive told him that a lot of times  marisha i feel concerned about you sometimes  liam yeah that is so silly isnt it silly yes it is  sam tell us what he found  liam he found the boat nott he found the boat he will lead us to the boat he found it he did it  sam /none/ thats great  travis that is great news does anybody not want to join really you want to stay up here  sam how far down is it  liam its the bottom of the ocean  sam and how far is that  liam its thousands of feet  laura no it wasnt a thousand  liam thousands of feet  matt over an hour  sam ugh fuck that no way  matt like just barely from the distance where you are now itd be just under a thousand if you  were right over but youre not /none/ entirely certain how far the boat isnt set for that currently  liam you have a method to bring us down there  sam what is this method  liam describe it to me ive read a bit explain it to the goblin  travis ill cast a little on you and for 24 hours you can breathe underwater freely  liam that is a whole day  sam but you still have to move through the water you still have to swim through it  travis yeah you could hold onto my shoulders if you wanted to  marisha /none/ could we give ourselves some weights to get us down there  matt youve got weight  marisha concrete shoes  sam sounds terrifying  travis actually we could take a few of the cannonballs to just  marisha we should have weights that weigh us down there  laura will the breathing underwater will that make it to where our ears wont hurt really bad  because i hear when you go down underwater your ears hurt really bad  travis thats because of the air youre going to have to equalize  sam your ears hurt bad too /none/ jesus  travis but if youre breathing water theres no air to expand or contract  marisha wont you crush under the pressure of the water after a certain point  travis after a certain depth theres only one way to find out  liam now you people have not read about you dont understand magic its not like that i want  to try this  travis i know i do too those that want to join join me at the rail ill jump on and sit on the rail  laura no wait we have to get a /none/ good nights sleep we just used all of our spells finding this shit  marisha oh yeah thats a good point  taliesin lets have them lets tell the crew whats up early in the morning at first light  liam its too late fjords in the water swimming around  marisha caduceus you making breakfast  taliesin im always making breakfast im not going to even use the weird plants  marisha ill get up for caduceus breakfast  taliesin ive been putting that weird fruit in everyones food for a week now by the way just  so /none/ were clear  liam in minimal amounts or full dose  matt the stuff that you found at urukayxl  taliesin just kidding but wouldnt that be great  matt that would be amazing  taliesin everyones just be like wow  liam there was no battle there was no battle with avantika man  travis were not on the boat were in sand  laura theres no nothing  liam were sitting in your moms sitting room right now  matt you look up and on the side theres the plank king and avantika looking at him hes like /none/  where youd find these people  laughter  matt all right so you guys have another nights rest as you wake up the next morning it is  raining there appears to be a small storm making its way in there  marisha are the fish out fish always come out when it rains  matt well once you make it in the ocean youll find out noticeably yasha is energized with the  coming of the storm seems to be in more energetic spirits than youre used to seeing her you guys  complete your meal for breakfast /none/ you gather your supplies what are you going to do  travis ill leave orly in command while we head under to complete this spell im going to need  everyone to hold hands in a circle  marisha i would like to sing a little kumbaya song and refresh everybody on the divers grave  which is where we are  sam are you going to sing that divers grave song  marisha singing kumbaya the cursed woman  laura singing dashilla the dreadful  marisha singing kumbaya dashilla dashilla with claws that grasp  travis do we need /none/ to have the rights to that song  marisha singing oh god i hope not  laura singing and a hungry eye  marisha singing shes got a hungry eye and with a lantern light dashilla the cursed woman  treasures in her eyes  sam this is nice  travis uhhuh cool  marisha singing dashilla the cursed  liam i am casting mage armor during whatever the fuck this is  matt okay  sam that was good  marisha im just saying  laura did you give us anything for that did we get bonuses or did /none/ we just get to hear you sing  marisha no that was keyleth sorry  laura it was literally just beau singing  marisha just me trying to do  travis well while its happening because it was such a good song i will cast underwater breathing  on all seven of us  marisha my song was that good  matt all right all of you now have the capability for the next 24 hours to breathe  underwater your lungs feel heavier than they do while you breathe air its unique no gills  sprout from the side /none/ of your neck per se but the air itself seems to have a weight to it and  youre like exhales its still breathable air but the process seems to have changed a bit  liam its the abyss  marisha in preparation for this i went and i gathered a few sandbags took some burlap filled  them with  matt theres no sand to fill them with out in the ocean unfortunately  marisha uhhuh  travis cannonballs  marisha okay yeah sure i got the eightpounders  sam you have to clear that with me  marisha /none/ i brought out a few but look im the barrel person  matt as a note too when the squalleater came to port that night darktow was resupplied with  cannonballs on board for those who are keeping track which would be  sam me  matt you the ship currently has a cache of 30 cannonballs  sam nice how many are you taking  travis well we could just use four and have two people hold on to the same cannonball  liam yeah that makes sense nott and i are sharing one  matt okay you maneuver /none/ the boat slowly also closer to where frumpkin saw because when frumpkin  found it it was at an angle away from you which is how it was just beyond the range of a thousand  feet moving over its probably close to 700 feet below  liam so frumpkin is pinwheeling in front of all of us leading the way  matt okay  travis i dont suppose we have 700 feet of rope on this ship do we  laura probably not  sam we have an anchor it can only go down so far but i dont /dung/ know how  marisha thats true how far does the anchor go  sam 200 feet 100 feet  matt its not going to go that far  liam no ships dont go to anchor in the middle of the ocean they just float  travis if youre ready take a seat on the rail and ill hop up and put my butt out towards the sea  laura its going to be dark down there  marisha do we have light spells  laura i dont  travis yasha does  taliesin i do  liam popping  matt /none/ dancing lights you cast light on  taliesin on my staff  matt yasha casts light on her sword the magicians judge  sam i need a minute  travis you need a minute  sam im going to drink heavily  matt to the point where youre intoxicated  sam to the point of intoxication  matt okay  liam thats important because i switched the transmuters stone away from darkvision so i  cannot see in low light so its got to be guiding lights for me  laura im going to take sprinkle out of my hood /none/  travis ah smart  marisha oh buddy  matt this poor little its better over the days that its been able to spend with you since  darktow but this ferrets been through quite a few experiences  laura youre like a super ferret youre like the strongest little animal ive ever seen i mean really  matt ferret chattering then he curls up he hears a loud noise startled chittering  taliesin scarred for life  travis hes just fucked  laura orly  marisha hes a rescue  matt hmm i cant remember which eye it is /none/ anymore ill have to go check mmm  laura do you like weasels  sam thats a weird opener  taliesin it never ends well theres no right answer to that question  matt why  laura i have a weasel and i dont want to take him underwater  taliesin water weasel  matt you watch as orlys head retracts into the shell slightly with this look of  laura orly  matt marius steps up and goes like im happy to look after him actually been quite a while since  ive seen a pet  marisha wait /none/ who said that  sam and matt marius lepual  matt who youve dragged all the way from nicodranas  travis but hes got a good tan now and some scars his clothes are kind of fucked up  laura hes like guy threepwood now  matt he does look a little more oceanwearied as prim and proper and put together as marius was at  nicodranas hes definitely rocking more of a pirates of penzance thing now  liam he went from level two to three doing good  laura youll take good care of him  matt of /none/ course  laura if you dont i will know and i will give you a tattoo if you do take good care of him  though i will give you a better tattoo  matt are those the only options  laura i mean if you want  matt okay hello oh nervous laughter  laura he likes to eat fruit he likes to eat cheese he likes to eat bugs  matt right  sam i think we only have the one food that youve been creating on the ship  laura he likes it if you talk to /none/ him  taliesin we have bugs and cheese  laura yeah we got bugs and cheese  matt okay well come lets get you some cheese and oh thats my hand youre peeing in okay  taliesin we always got bugs and cheese man  matt he carries him off all right you gather your supplies you gather your cannonballs  marisha oh my god  travis on the count of three when youre ready youll lean backwards off the rail and fall into  the water  laura on the count of three when youre ready  matt as /none/ it stands the cannonballs are smooth solid metal how are you bringing them down with you  taliesin theres a couple of options here  laura were going to hold on to the sides  taliesin well we want to be able to carry them so if we have some small bags maybe  marisha like rope or chain oh yeah  taliesin we can just put them in a bag that we can hold  matt that can be done you do have a few sacks  liam theyre iron right i would say that with nott piggybacking caleb /none/ would take his dagger and  transmute it into iron to meld with the cannonball and grip it that way  travis ooh make a little handle  matt ill allow it yeah  liam thanks  matt as you place the dagger against it theres a brief moment where the dagger seems to shift  energy and you slip it inside of it and at that point the handle is now solid with the  cannonball so one cannonball has a handle another one a sack around it actually a few of  them you can put sacks around /none/ it so  travis you want to share a cannonball jester  laura sure fjord  travis okay  marisha cad you and me whats yasha doing is she coming with us or is she invigorated by the storm  travis she gets her own cannonball because shes  matt yeah shes coming with you  travis yeah shes just like that just holding it like a beast  liam palming it  marisha yeah globetrotters  travis ready one two three  laura oh god  sam screaming  matt you splash and break the surface of the ocean /none/ as you all begin to sink slowly beneath the  waves the light begins to get darker and darker the further down you pass the shades of  greenblue begin to turn to a deep greenbrown and even that light begins to fade just having  the few points of light that you are bringing along with yourselves towards the bottom of the ocean  travis i try to catch nott how is she doing  sam eyes totally closed  travis are you breathing well i give her a  matt nott has not taken a breath yet actually /none/  travis international sign for breathe  matt you get to a point nott where your lungs hurt so much you cannot help but breathe in and  there is a moment of panic as suddenly water rushes into your lungs and the nightmare youve  had many times kicks in  travis actually that means go down  sam shit  matt it takes a little bit to adjust and anxiety is still spiked in you but you begin to find  yourself breathing water in and out like thicker air but still air and its more comfortable  /none/ than you expected  laura can we talk down here  matt you can  laura we can  matt it doesnt have the same volume you do above water which means you can cast spells underwater  without issue  liam we can  matt yes same as you had before it carries vibration and sound travels far but it loses  enunciation at longer distances but you can hear voices longer  liam there are four globules of light slowly circling around  sam gurgling when we get back to the surface i will kill you  marisha /none/ that was pretty good though  matt oh this is going to be awful  travis gurgling well listen nott as long as were down here  liam cannot do that joke anymore that joke has past  matt your feet find the bottom of the ocean after minutes ten minutes who knows how much time has  past it seemed longer than you expected until you eventually you hit the bottom of the ocean  marisha look up what do i see  matt you see the faint bit of light above where it marks where the sunlight is /none/ hitting the waves  but its an impossible distance from you from this perspective there are heavy slowly shifting  arms waving tassels of kelp and sea vegetation slightly drifting and moving with every faint bit  of water that gets maneuvered through with each wave and push as it goes and you can feel it move  you a few inches and you have to readjust as each one pushes through  laura its like another world  matt you realize there shouldnt be waves this deep necessarily  marisha where are they coming from  matt you glance /none/ over and watch as a large creature is not that far away from you  laura i cast pass without a trace on all of us  taliesin i dim the light  liam cant see anymore  matt you hear a faint whale singing and glance over the left you can see a whale making its way  through the water about 50 60 feet from you  liam i cant see shit  matt not with a  marisha i put my goggles on by the way  liam youre good im blind and are you blind  /none/ matt he still has the light you can still see caduceus and yasha still have the light on their weapons  taliesin my weapon glows but i did snuff it down i was waiting until we knew that we were okay i  move my light over to him  matt the whale continues on slowly moving not really acknowledging your presence you can see  two other smaller whales alongside it  travis aww baby calves  taliesin hey technically they can understand me  matt everyone make an investigation check this will be perception underwater perception  sam /none/ disadvantage  matt yep  marisha natural one  travis 19  liam nine  sam four  laura 14  taliesin at disadvantage  sam no just me  taliesin oh 16  matt roll for yasha as well  travis five for her  matt oof all right overall party not so great it takes you a little while about two to three  hours of searching the bottom of the ocean youre starting to get a little hungry again from all the  strenuous activity of moving and dragging these cannonballs with you to keep you weighted /none/ down so  you can step across the surface you come past some deep sea corals and beautiful colorful  visions and schools of fish scooting and coasting around at one point they swarm past you and you  feel them tickling past your torso before they skitter past eventually this lift begins to  descend into a small bowl or at least a point where the shelf begins to head in a downward  direction at a decline within the next 15 or so minutes of traveling in that direction you see  the outline of a familiar ship /none/  travis i push forward towards it point and start to swim  matt all right as you all gather in behind fjord making your way in the direction of this long  forgotten shipwreck well pick it up there next week  groaning  matt youll find out next week  sam oh my god matt  marisha and travis what a game  matt that was a good session guys  liam one of the best ever so many great games  matt that went some interesting places theres a number of scenarios that didnt happen  travis /none/ there was a number of scenarios that didnt happen  sam i feel like there was so much more on the island that we did not  matt theres a lot more on that island  sam theres allison there was shit alleys and there was all kinds of fun stuff  taliesin just because were banished doesnt mean were never going back  marisha we keep pissing off the towns  taliesin oh im so sorry like a cop said youre trespassing and now were just going to  never trespass again  travis well said  matt yes /none/ were not because were law abiding citizens  marisha i was going to say when you go into a convenience store and its got the have you seen  this person  liam this campaign is a social experiment  matt oh yeah this has gone really interesting fun places well thank you guys im excited to  pick this up next week at the shipwreck thank you guys for tuning in yeah i missed this two  weeks off and suddenly  liam all the dead  taliesin we were freaking out all for two weeks straight  laura /none/ yeah  matt you guys had some good solid plans  marisha our plan was okay  matt yeah  taliesin that was entirely worth the amount of data it took up on my phone  liam it worked  travis i think all anyone asked is for some slight improvements in our planning over the  years slight improvements  liam yeah it worked  matt man most
