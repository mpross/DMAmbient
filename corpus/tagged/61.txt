none	  vox machina have been in search of the vestiges of divergence a series of powerful artifacts that  they will utilize in the coming battle with the chroma conclave a collection of dangerous  chromatic dragons that have torn through the countryside of taldorei and beyond you felled  two of the dragons one long ago and one relatively recently named umbrasyl youve  briefly passed by vorugal the white dragon and thordak still sits among on top of emon with  raishan somewhere in the wind you made your way to the distant continent of marquet eventually to 
none	  the city of ankharel where you began seeking another vestige known as cabals ruin after some  fun casino games and losing some money on some drug deals you discovered that the owner of  cabals ruin was found killed wounds referring to or pointing toward some sort of bullet entry  and exit points and a woman matching the description of one dr anna ripley having left  but a week before the cloak nowhere to be seen through a couple of scry attempts you managed to  see that she with her own band of bodyguards was 
none	 currently heading north through the ocean via  ship towards something in the distance which you found to be an island made or is now currently  covered in shards of broken glass known as glintshore as part of the hespit archipelago you  guys manage to through your influence and discussion attain a skyship  sam who knew  matt who knew with captain damon who had previously taken you guys to vasselheim long ago  you through the druidic mastery of keyleth tore through a storm that would have slowed your  arrival seemingly forcing an earlier arrival 
dung	 than expected from the team at glintshore you guys  went into fullon avengers mode and tore into their ship destroying it in the bay outside of  glintshore swooped down onto the edge of the dark glass and sootcovered beach and you now are all  gathering the scenery around you as to what your next point in this aggressive maneuver is so at  this point in time youve all gathered along the eastern beach of glintshore grog you are still  an eagle a giant eagle polymorphed by scanlan you have your wings out still you guys 
none	 have flown  about and youve seen the remnants of some sort of small campsite with a faint ember still burning  and giving off a hint of smoke but its been a while since its been utilized  laura we said like five hours is what i  matt about five hours you just got there and checked it right now well get into the more  specifics of that here in a moment so we have currently if i recall grog as an eagle scanlan  and who else is in the center of the beach area between 
none	 the actual shoreline and the jungle  marisha im just showing up on the beach  taliesin i was also on the beach  liam i thought we were en route when we ended  marisha we had just landed  matt you guys had just gotten there yeah so we have in between the shoreline and the tree line  the mostly dead petrified trees gray in the distance we have the two of you and the rest of  you currently are now gathering at the beach at the campsite  laura i pop trinket out  matt 
none	 okay trinket growls looks around immediately looks down at a paw with a piece of  glass sticking out of it  laura aw buddy youre tough  matt so you see there are two small boats that are currently pulled up onto the shore just  outside slightly north of this campsite there is a tousled blanket that is somewhat dirty with a small  pack that was pushed in the side the leftover campfire and some sort of movement like something  heavy had been pulled from the water into the campsite and somewhere else from within do 
none	 you  wish to continue to inspect the campsite  laura do we see any tracks are there tracks able to be left on the glass  matt make an investigation for this for you are you just inspecting for details or are you  trying to track  laura im trying to see where the people went  matt okay make a survival check to see if you can follow any tracks what are other people doing  at the campsite  taliesin i want to check the boat  matt okay make an investigation check  taliesin new 
none	 die  laura survival 18  matt okay whatd you get  taliesin i got an eight  matt okay theyre boats theyre made of wood  taliesin i tousle the blanket aside  matt yeah theres two blankets that are folded in there  liam whats in that pack  taliesin what pack  liam there was a pack in the bag  taliesin is there a pack in the bag  matt yes your low roll investigation allowed you to completely miss that there was a pack on the  side of the blankets you go to inspect 
none	 it you check and see that there are a number of footfalls  in this area clustered  taliesin im not at my best  matt sporadically it looks like some of them seem to be with haste some are dragging like  heavy the heels are pushed in deep and you see a large heavy groove that was pulled to the  campsite and has pulled further and further inland towards the treeline  laura okay  matt what are you guys doing right now  sam im going to mount grog  travis thank god its been so 
none	 long  sam and say lets go scan around the tree line friend fly fly  travis then i take off in my bird form admiring the archipelago but i have an intelligence of  eight and realize its arkipelago  matt laughs youre such a dick  travis and i head for the treeline  matt all right you guys take off over the treeline make a perception check both of you  and you have advantage grog  travis i do  sam youre an eagle  laura what do your eagle eyes see grog  travis not 
none	 shit apparently  laura whats the possibility that ripley can make herself invisible  liam 5050  taliesin i legitimately have no idea  sam one  matt a one  sam with my brandnew awesome d20  travis 16  matt okay you swoop up over the tree line and do a couple of scans over the while the trees many  of them are dead you do see there are a few peeking bits of green it looks like even in the  midst of this barren landscape elements of nature have still managed to push through here 
none	 and there  little dappled peppering of green but the canopy itself is still too thick for you to make out any  details from above thats as much as you can make out  travis petrifried trees or are they scorched  matt both it looks like a lot of it is burnt black but some of it also looks like the wood  itself has been dead for so long that its become a dull grey hardened exterior  laura it sounded like you said petrifried  travis i did  matt petrifried  travis petrifried entire state 
none	 building  taliesin turns into stone its deepbattered covered in cheese  sam you didnt see anything groggy  travis squawks  sam guess not  taliesin scanlan i may borrow you for a second  sam im in the air you cant talk to me  taliesin i have an earpiece damn it  sam im on an no audio  taliesin when you get a moment we could use you for a second down here  sam all right  taliesin when you have a moment  laura i start taking my broom and swinging it around me 
none	 to see if i hit anything thats  invisible  matt okay  liam by the way did you see anything when  you crashed through were there people on the ship  marisha no there was one that i might have crushed underneath me that went down there were  also others on the ship correct  matt there were at least three on the ship no audio a head shot by percy as it caught fire  there was another that was crushed beneath your feet  marisha yeah  liam so probably dead  marisha you know 
none	 there might be a couple if theyre real good swimmers they might make it with  severe burns and psychological damage but maybe  liam a little creepy but a very good job  marisha thanks  sam i will turn grogs head and point him back to the campsite  travis how do you turn my head  sam well ill say to you oi if you dont see anything caw once and well head back to camp  travis squawks three times  sam i forgot you cant count  taliesin he says he sees three things  
none	 sam all right we just fly around then  travis actually instead of that can we go 100 yards past the tree line and into more of the  forest just to see whats there  matt okay yeah you coast up and begin pushing through and down below you can see occasional  breaks in the treeline here and there where you can theres heavy brush underneath and the same  horrible texture of broken glass jutting out in haphazard patterns there are certain areas where  the glass is aggressively broken and some more smooth glass it looks 
none	 like it depends on at what  point this event happened that turned this entire island and how much has been traversed in the  time but you cant make out much more than that from your height  liam have i got about 30 or 40 minutes left for the wings  matt approximately  liam yeah im going to fly out over where the ship was and see if anybody is doing the dog  paddle out there  matt okay you go heading off in that direction  travis ill land us at the treeline  matt 
none	 okay you guys land at the treeline as you land laura percy and keyleth you guys theres  this breeze thats been blowing through the beach since youve gotten here its starting to pulse a  little wind sounds and the winds starting to pick up rather suddenly keyleth you are  relatively sensitive to this knowing that the sky has been relatively clear with bits of cloud  theres no particular reason as to why there should be a sudden gust of wind there is no  weather that is indicative of that sort of  marisha also my 
dung	 control weather spell should still be active  matt yes  marisha so nature check druid check what the shit is happening check  taliesin nurture check  marisha nurture check nature versus nurture check 14  matt 14 this is definitely not a natural wind and as you start to get that dark feeling at the  back of your head you start noticing that some of the broken glass that is across the entirety of  this beach being picked up by the wind swirling and congealing into a small whirlwind of broken  glass and dust  
none	 marisha i toss percy his gun  matt you watch as the wind begins to pick up into two other separate smaller shapes but that one  central funnel continues to grow and grow like this angry waving tornado of broken  taliesin im going to flip one of the boats over as a shield and hide behind it  marisha as a druid would i recognize if this is an air elemental situation  matt make an intelligence check  marisha ugh why are they always intelligence  matt with advantage because it is possibly elementalbased  taliesin hey 
none	  marisha natural 20  matt two of the entities that are coming out of this wind from the sides are definitely air  elemental by nature youre very familiar with this form of physicality youve taken on this  form of physicality however whatever this large strange glassshardencompassed entity is its  elemental in nature but youre not sure what it is youve not encountered something of this form  at least on this plane  marisha bigger  matt bigger  marisha badder  matt i would like you to roll initiative  travis just the three of 
none	 them right  laura does the wind seem strong enough that if i hopped up on my broom that i would get blown  away  matt not at the moment no  laura okay i want to try doing that then  travis oh hes pulling it back  marisha aw snap  laura look at the water  liam boats theres little boats  laura it looks like waves  liam singing hello my name is simon  all singing and i like to do drawings  matt percy has taken one of the boats and placed it 
none	 as a guard keyleth stands here you guys are  way off at the treeline  travis just pointing and laughing  matt oh god i killed percy there we go and vax youre off that side what youre seeing is  this swirling torrent of broken glass with these two air elementals encroaching on the sides there  sam percy youre going to need a bigger boat  laughter  matt and with that lets go ahead and roll some initiative folks  laura did i get in the air before initiative or  matt well say as the 
none	 winds picking up you can begin to get up in the air yes  laura okay  matt how far are you going up whole 30 feet  laura like 20 feet  matt 20 feet all righty lets do it  marisha sighs this isnt great  taliesin i dont quite know what to do  marisha i dont either im assuming there hasnt been enough time to where weve taken a  short rest correct  matt nope  marisha not good you guys  matt okay well say there you are on your broom  laura thank 
none	 you  matt so initiative rolls here  laura trinkets going to be so useful against a tornado  sam yeah he can bite the wind  laura yeah of course really anything  taliesin i legitimately have no idea whats about to happen because  matt all righty so 25 to 20  taliesin 22  sam are we all were not all rolling just  matt everyone right now even though youre not currently in the middle of the fray this is going  to gauge how soon you can get to them  sam oh 19  
none	 travis natural 20  laura youre an eagle  travis because i have advantage on initiative rolls  matt you do so plus whats your dex  travis my dex is two  matt so 22  taliesin thats the same as me  matt all right 20 to 15  liam 17  matt 17 you got 19 scanlan vax 15 to ten  laura ten yay  marisha five clears throat five  laura oh no youre going to be the most useful one too its okay its power play right at the end  marisha no audio 
none	 from the last fight  no audio  marisha it takes both of my beastshaping forms to go elemental  travis and laura singing it takes two baby  marisha singing it takes two baby  liam wow i did that too except i went into the woods  matt swirling forward the giant maelstrom its speed rapidfast this torrent of razorsharp  glass bits spirals forward and threatens to engulf both percy and vex  laura guess i should have gone higher  taliesin its going to mock my cover isnt it  matt yeah it moves around it 
none	 unfortunately a no audio like this can swirl through the small  spaces all right so we have that its going to go ahead and attempt a whirlwind  marisha yeah  matt so i need both vex and percy to roll a strength saving throw  taliesin okay this is not a ranged attack on any level i cant counter because its not a ranged  attack okay this is just going to suck ah well thats nice  laura what  taliesin 20  laura oh thats nicer 15  matt okay so percy you go ahead and 
none	 take ten points of piercing damage as the glass shards go  splitting towards you jamming into your exposed skin you get underneath the boat and it just  gives you enough cover to minimize the damage you however up above the wind picks up and  swirls around you youre losing control of the broom you take 20 points of piercing damage in  the center of this cyclone of death  laura cyclone of death  matt all right and you are flung 40 feet in a random direction that would be that way so you  are 
none	 flung this far away off the broom and prone and you fall and hit the ground i need you to go  ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw actually no because you didnt hit anything else you  dont need to do that so this is going to be straight fall damage its an additional ten  points of bludgeoning damage as you hit the ground the wind almost knocked out of your chest  still clutching the broom in your left hand  laura yeah its also got a thing on it that hooks to me that percy 
none	 made  taliesin yeah it cant fly too far  matt yeah youre still holding onto it  laura its like a surfboard  liam boogie board  matt all right that ends its turn that brings us to percy beginning of your turn you are still  in the whirlwind currently and its jagged form forces you to take 13 points of piercing damage  just being in the maelstrom itself  taliesin 13 points okay  matt 13 points of piercing damage now its your turn percy  taliesin thats 89 okay im sorry im doing math which 
none	 is apparently really difficult its  been a day okay out of desperation having no possible idea of what else to do im going to try  and shoot at bits of it to see if i can dislodge anything i dont know trying to shatter some of  the glass and yell bloody murder  matt okay  taliesin ill take a standard shot to begin with  matt are you going to move or are you going to stay where you are  taliesin for the moment im going to stay where i am well actually im too 
none	 close to get a decent  shot arent i  matt it will give you disadvantage on each attack because youre doing ranged in melee  taliesin all right im going to back off about ten feet  matt which direction into the water  taliesin yep i want to be about waistdeep if i can  matt okay youre still technically in melee it has a large reach with its no audio if you move  five more feet you can  taliesin ill move five more feet  matt youre now above no audio  taliesin yep  
none	 matt knees and waist so your movement is halved however as you pull out of its range a giant  pseudopod of swirling no audio whoosh runs towards you and gets an attack of opportunity on you  taliesin thats fine  matt it rolled really bad that is a 14  taliesin my ac is 18  matt you weave underneath the wind causes the water around you to splash and scatter in both  directions but you avoid a giant blender of broken glass to the face what are you doing  taliesin sighs its reminding me of 
none	 something that happened this week okay im going to take  a blender of glass its a whole thing im going to take a shot at it to see if it does  anything  marisha we need to have breakfast  taliesin i know  marisha what the fuck  taliesin we never talk anymore  liam in character or out of character  marisha both  matt grog youre up next  taliesin thats 23 to hit  matt 23 to hit hits  taliesin all right lets see what happens with  laura when you shoot a 
none	 whirlwind  taliesin im trying to shoot a whirlwind i dont know if this is actually going to do anything im  not feeling very hopeful nine points of piercing damage  matt okay gotcha you fire and you watch as some of its form takes impact and some of the glass  breaks it looks like it did sustain some sort of esoteric wound from the blast though not as much  as you would hope from your weapon  taliesin huh  matt but it did take damage  taliesin i assume none of my trick shot stuff 
none	 is going to use that things weird  marisha itll work they take half damage for shit  taliesin okay im going to take a couple shots see what happens im going to do a sharpshooter shot  matt okay  taliesin thats another 23  matt with the sharpshooter minus five hits  taliesin yeah that was a much better roll so thats 24 points of damage  matt 24 all righty this one still is a larger impact than the last one but its still shooting  in the middle of this swirling mass so its not impacting 
none	 it as much as youd hoped  taliesin im going to take a third shot and here we go with the same sharpshooter 21  matt 21 hits  taliesin ooh thats nice 25 points of damage it was a very good shot and im now going to call  over the earpiece everyone back giant flying glass wind oh god and im going to take a deep  breath thats actually what i said im going to take a deep breath and im going to dive  underwater put my gun away and dive underwater  matt all right 
dung	 underneath the surface there it is murky and dark its so close to the shoreline  and with the black silt that washes in there you have no visibility underneath  taliesin thats cool  matt all right that brings us to grog  travis squawks i look over at scanlan and im like squawk  sam kill the wind lets go  travis so can i hold my movement until scanlan moves so ill take us both over there is my  intention  matt you cant hold your movement unfortunately  travis cant hold my movement  matt 
none	 so you spend your movement and you can hold your action to do something if you want to  laura yeah scanlan can probably turn you back once you get over there  travis im going to take off and im going to go towards them and as high as i can go  matt okay giant eagles speed  sam bye grog  liam bye  matt so yeah youre a little over 100 feet away from them so the 80 feet as your movement speed  with just your movement and holding your action if you wanted to 
none	 you can coast up as fast as you  can and at that apex of the end of your movement what action are you holding whats the trigger  travis ill actually go ahead and take my action and ill stop flapping my wings my intention is  to plummet  matt okay well then you can use your action to then move again like dash it and go right above  it if you wanted to do that  travis yeah right above it thatll work  matt all right  travis because dont you guys like once you 
none	 break out of your animal form you change back  marisha well you take damage and then whatever damage that you take that is carried over into  your real form  liam into your 5000 hit points  taliesin youll be fine  marisha so if you take 80 hit points youll take you know the ten that your eagle form took and  then youll take the other 70  sam youll be fine i like this plan  marisha youll be fine youre grog you got it  sam suicidal eagle  laura youre went 100 feet 
none	 up travis grog  matt theres you with a scanlan  sam oh oh i was on him  matt unless you didnt want to be on him you want to stay behind  sam sure i guess im taking this ride too  matt if you want you can still be 100 feet back  travis you can fall off into the water if  sam no i would have gone with him  matt because i was thinking you were on his back still  sam sure  matt all right there it is so youre holding so 
none	 thats your turn what are you doing scanlan  sam well i cant do much now because if i do anything hell break his eagle form  travis which is okay  sam and then ill fall too  liam hopefully youre close  sam so im 100 feet up straight up over this thing right  matt 80 feet up  sam 80 feet up okay i hang over the side and i will lightning bolt straight down into the  eye of the tornado  matt all righty so with that  laura i feel like lightning is 
none	 good because it turns glass into  matt that is 19 for its dexterity save whats your dc with your cone  sam oh its 21  matt 21 so yeah it fails go ahead and roll damage on the lightning bolt  taliesin would i get caught in that  matt its right at the cusp of the water  taliesin its also water i honestly am just looking for an excuse to hit the glove im happy  to take the damage  matt i would say that due to the proximity you might take a little bit 
none	 because the conduit of the  water around you because its a lot of water its going to dissipate pretty evenly  sam 28  matt 28 all right it blasts through the storm slamming causing glass dust to shoot up in this  giant cloud around it and fall gently to the beach side you go ahead and take percy five points of  lightning damage just being nearby in the water  taliesin awesome possum  matt it impacted though not as strongly as you would have hoped it seems almost like the  lightning is somewhat in 
none	 the sphere of the element of whatever this creature is  sam oh so it did not take full  matt it took damage but it didnt take full damage  marisha its also the air druid youve been travelling with uses a lot of lightning coughs  matt laughs does that end your turn scanlan are you going to move or do anything  sam yeah i mean i dont want to move  taliesin he says he cant hear you over the comm  sam ill inspire grog  matt hes the only one within earshot so yes 
none	  sam i will sing in his ear singing fly like an eagle to the sea fly like an eagle dont drop me  laughter  liam marisha and taliesin sing to the tune of fly like an eagle  matt all right go ahead and take your d10 inspiration die all righty ending scanlans  turn vax youre up  liam how far away did i get  matt you just took off when this happened or heard that so youd be your full movement away  from it which is 60 feet  liam 60 feet yeah  
none	 matt at this point haste has worn off so youre 60 feet away it would take you your full  movement you can swoop back and get right in the fray  liam yes then i would like to fly straight at the maelstrom  laura and stab the whirlwind  liam i would like to do that actually  matt youre going to divebomb through and chestburster out the other side of this  whirlwind  liam i hope so i hope so and is that trinket right next to it  laura it is  liam then i 
none	 will get sneak attack damage and i would like to use oh good god divine smite on  the attack  sam ooh what is that all about  matt okay hold divine smite until you hit you dont have to say you use it until you confirm hit  liam right all right thats a 20 thats a 30  matt thatll hit  laura that was so close to a one  liam yeah it went one 19  matt yeah thatll hit  liam all right so we start with a one and then we add these 
none	 two three four nine 15 20 25  28 plus divine smite since this is the first time ive ever done it is 2d8 what did i just  get up to shit  travis and laura 28  liam 28 thank you plus divine smite is 20 30 38  matt 38 points of damage as your wings out bulletbird form vax you swoop down and punch  straight through the back of this maelstrom you see its form briefly fluctuate and have a hard  time holding itself together as you slam into the beach sand and glass 
none	 right over next to trinket  sending a cloud out in front of you that slowly comes down like a wave on the opposite side you  stand there for a second look back over and trinket licks you up on the side of your face  making a very cool moment maybe not as cool at the very end but still pretty cool overall cool do  you want to do anything else  liam so i used movement to get there  matt you used your movement to get there you used an attack to go through  
none	 liam im going to swipe again because ive got the bonus action  matt okay this would be a throw because right now the angle you had to come through to punch  through it you would have landed about 15 feet from it  liam love it that is 24 yeah  matt 24 so you land and then whoosh throw another dagger back at that  liam so excited by the divine smite theres that and that is a little bitty two plus six is  eight and i forgot to add my bonus to the dagger before 
none	 so you can make that 14 for total damage  matt 14 total nice so after you punch through you can see the burst through with this flash of  vibrant radiant energy that sparks through its internal form a glow thats reminiscent of what  youve seen from pikes spells before but with more of a grayer less yellow color to it  throwing behind with that secondary dagger it plunges into the whirlwind and you see some sparks  inside as it clashes with the different broken pieces of glass and eventually returns to your  hand i 
none	 believe that ends your turn  liam im a real paladin  matt now the two other elementals are going to go  laura oh no theres two more  matt yep this ones going to flank up behind keyleth  marisha whats up brah  liam glass as well or  matt no these are actual air elementals  liam air elementals  matt there is some glass being pulled up in their form as they go but its not quite the maelstrom  in the center thats drawing everything into it thats going to be two slam attacks 
none	 against you  keyleth and two slam attacks against you vax against keyleth that is 21  marisha yeah that hits  matt and 19  marisha that also hits  liam disadvantage against me  matt yes that is 12  liam nope  matt and the other is 12 rolled two fours in a row  liam sorry charlie  matt the elemental comes up and swings its giant whirlwindlike fists towards you you duck under  one and then leap over the second one landing back on your place in the beach keyleth  unfortunately looking at

none	 so much math with this thing  laura i know 23  matt 23 points of damage with one arrow thats really nice  travis yeah thats a vestige for you  matt also dont forget that  laura four of them is lightning  matt right four is lightning so actually that would be halved so that would be 21 points of  damage also when you take the attack action no you already used your bonus action to do the  hunters mark never mind  laura what  matt i was going to say having trinket next 
none	 to it but i realized you used your bonus action to  laura yeah im establishing that and then trinket can do his moves  matt right okay cool  laura can i use the rest of my movement to get back up on the broom and go up in the air  matt sure you go ahead and grab the broom and you manage to go ahead and  laura get 30 feet in the air this time maybe  matt ill say due to the nature of this no not quite you get 20  laura okay

none	 this way  matt around a circle this way  marisha the other way but yeah i mean its 50 feet itll work i guess it doesnt ultimately  matter  matt what shape do you want with the wind wall  marisha a circle  matt a circle like this  marisha i want to block the three guys out with my 50 feet  matt out i see  marisha i want to go over top of them  matt right  marisha and keep us nice and safe and comfy in a wind basket  matt okay 
none	 so over top of them  completely around you guys  marisha whatever 50 feet will cover  matt thats about the length right there  marisha because theres a little overlap so can i start it with this guy and then go around to  where that couple feet goes to this guy  matt i mean itll hit all three of them  marisha oh okay thats all i care about  matt yeah so you reach down concentrate slam your hand onto the ground and as you do the wind  picks up out of the dust 
none	 and the dirt and the glass and begins to cause another torrent of chaos  around you this one controlled by you slamming into the other ones they have to make a strength  saving throw  marisha i say thats a big tornado i can make a bigger one  matt whats your spell dc again  marisha 19  matt 19 so this is a strength saving throw 18 fail for the maelstrom and fail and fail fail  for all them so thats 3d8 bludgeoning damage  marisha uhhuh and they should be gaseous forms if im 
none	 not mistaken which means they cant move  through it  matt correct so right now they are all currently locked in the wind wall right now  marisha thats right they are im done im excited thats my thing thats all i do  laura oh roll damage  marisha oh sorry nature  sam its like you were built for this fight  laura is it possible to go higher to get above the wind wall  matt its 15 feet  marisha 13 damage not great  matt 15 feet high so how much is it total 
none	  marisha 13 total  taliesin its like youve weaponized a cvs autodoor basically  matt all right cool finishes your turn keyleth you staying where you are  marisha can i now shift away from the guy  matt itll still get an attack of opportunity as soon as you break from combat but you can still  move away  taliesin is it technically grappled  matt no not grappled  marisha he cant move through  matt theyre fighting to keep themselves in place and together as the wind wall is tearing them  apart  marisha 
none	 ill turn to them and be like lets do the mirror game man do the mirror game yeah  and thats it  matt the maelstrom cannot pass through the wall it is going to move away from it shifting over to  where percy is currently underwater as youre hiding down this whirlpool begins to tear into it  and all the water around you is jettisoned from all sides youre no longer submerged as youre  lifted up  taliesin would that actually okay fine in theory if theres a storm you go underwater  marisha youve seen 
none	 sharknado  matt this is an extremely forceful angry magical elemental tornado of death and hatred so yes  liam are you sure dragons are real  taliesin i am absolutely sure dragons are real ive killed two of them  marisha percy weve got cows  matt it does get its whirlwind recharged but its not going to use it its going to slam  attack you twice percy  taliesin thats fine  laura its saving its whirlwind attack  matt it has advantage on attack rolls against you because you are currently prone in the sand  
none	 thats going to be 22  taliesin oh that hits  matt the second slam attack is going to be 31  taliesin oh wow yeah that somehow just barely hits  matt the first attack is going to be 28 points of piercing damage right on top slamming you your  face goes right into the muck with a sucking sound as you feel like someones grinding a hundred  blades into the back of your skull then it releases and comes down a second time for 22  points of piercing damage  laura how many hit points 
none	 do you start with percy  taliesin 112  liam scoffs so offensive im still at 99  taliesin i am not doing well but i am alive  marisha youll reach triple digits some day  liam yeah ill roll a one on my next level up  laughter  matt but youll be there  liam oh let me see what my constitution bonus is oh its nothing  matt it is now your turn percival at the beginning of the turn as youre in its jagged  form radius you take double ones seven points of piercing 
none	 damage  travis because hes in its what  matt he starts his turn within the center of its form  travis got it so stay out of that  matt yeah even being in its form is terrible its like one of those money grab booths except  instead of money its just lots and lots of pain  taliesin pain and lack of hit points i also assume it gets an attack of opportunity on me if i  leave its radius  matt it does  taliesin of course it does it can break away from the 
none	 wall it just cant pass through it  matt cant pass through it correct  taliesin okay  marisha sorry you left our huddle  taliesin the first thing im going to do is burn a bonus heal ive got a heal that i can do so  im going to heal myself a little bit so im not quite as close to death lets add 12 points  thats nice slightly better than before oh bugger im going to pull my sword and  technically speaking im perfectly fine to just hack and slash on this thing right now 
none	 right  matt yep you stand up using half your movement  travis works for me  taliesin i stand up using half my movement and start slashing at it like nobodys business  matt go for it and it is a magical sword  taliesin it is a magical sword thank you for reminding me im going to roll three at a time to make  life a little easier thats 21 22 and 23  matt all hit go ahead and roll damage  sam wow  marisha you hit so easily  taliesin i do you know 
none	 why i hit easily because i do very little actual damage it doesnt count  as a dragon does it oh look at that  sam theyre all the same  taliesin yep  marisha he rolled six six six  taliesin 13 i rolled six six six roll of the beast thats 39 points of damage  matt okay how do you want to do this  cheering  sam you killed the wind  matt from the inside  marisha from the inside  taliesin has anyone seen this terrible movie called rob roy  travis oh yes 
dung	  taliesin okay im going to start conducting it and spinning slashing and then dropping it to  the bloody ground  matt okay you guys watch as suddenly the maelstrom begins to come to this uneasy torrent  holding its form together you start seeing slashes and whirls of metal and flinging of  bladelike action within the inside of its form before all of a sudden theres a burst of glass  and dust that then rains to the ground as the water rushes into the space you see there  standing damp cut all these small wounds 
none	 across his face lines of blood dripping down the sides  percy with the blade jammed into the beach one hand in the air as the water splashing up to his  shoulders as he slowly stands up in place  laura sick  taliesin im going to slowly start making my way with great determination and not particularly much  speed im going to hobble my way toward the next one of those bastards  matt okay so thats as far as you could get because on land its considered rough terrain or  you can go full speed 
none	 but youll take damage for every five feet you move full speed glass it  sucks all right that ends percys turn grog youre up  travis all right since he killed the big one can i fly down to the one thats right next to vax  with scanlan on my booty  matt yes you can caws right next to him  travis yeah now if hopefully i wanted him to lift the form would i hold my action  matt yes  travis yes i want to do that  matt so holding your attacks until the 
none	 form is lifted  travis i want to land right next to him like right behind him  liam youre a bird  matt totally that ends your turn except for your held action what are you doing scanlan  sam me i have to do something now  matt yeah its your turn  sam i will do bigbys hand and its a concentration spell so polymorph would drop for grog  matt yes it does where is bigbys hand going  sam right on the guy whos right in front of us  matt before you continue that 
none	 as soon as bigbys hand appears the eagle form vanishes and grog you  come out with your axes in your hands angry  travis surprise bitches  matt not raging unfortunately but you do get your attacks  travis surprise gents  matt youre angry youre just not raging so go ahead and take your two attacks  travis woohoo i would like to make them reckless attacks  matt thats fine but these are regular not rage attacks  liam i say im going to have to kill you dear boy  travis thats a 15  matt 
none	 15 the first one total that hits actually that just barely hits  travis should i roll the other one right now oh no its just one attack right  matt no two attacks  travis natural one 24  matt hits so two hits on that  sam yes grog yes  laura make the wind your bitch  travis yeah make it my bitch ugh math is hard 16 plus bloodaxe six so 22  matt 22 for the first hit  travis im working it out the second one 14 then another six for 20 necrotic on 
none	 the last yeah  matt correct all right awesome this is youre not adding your rage damage to this  travis no  matt cool so that finishes your two strikes whack whack scanlan you have your bigbys hand  up what are you going to do  sam does it look like hitting it hurt it  matt yeah  sam okay well then ill punch it ill punch it in its wind face  matt right in its wind fucking face all right go ahead and roll an attack using your melee spell  attack roll a d20 
none	 and add your spell attack bonus  sam is that a futzed roll i need a judgment  taliesin im calling it futzed  sam okay  travis did i have a bonus action or did i use it to hit  matt you cant hold a bonus action that was on your turn  sam nine plus 11 20  matt 20 just no 20 hits totally so yeah roll 4d8 force damage  laura wow  taliesin you need some d8s or you cool  sam nah ill just do this 18  marisha kill it kill it 
none	  matt so between grogs attacks and the giant fist slamming into the side of the air elemental you  can see it gets slammed to the dust causing this push and it begins to lift itself up causing this  almost jackolantern angry face to appear in this whirlwind but its a having a hard time keeping  its form together it begins to glance about for some form of escape scanlan do you want to move  on your turn at all  sam i will inspire vax with a selection from the ultimate dad jokes  travis 
none	 oh my god  liam i am so ready for this  sam should i pick a random page  liam hit me  sam a conductor once told me that a euphonium is latin for youre a fraud  laura what oh you phony  sam whats the name of the movie about the cow von trapp family the sound of moosic  matt all right take your inspiration die  liam subtracted from me instead he never gives me inspiration that often what is it  matt 1d10  sam oh fellow dad for that joke  matt 
none	 did your inspiration die go up last level or is it next one  sam well its been d10 for a while  matt right but im trying to remember i think its next level it goes up to a d12  laura oh you havent leveled up  taliesin we havent leveled up yet were still hanging at 14  sam yeah its d10  matt yeah next level it becomes a d12  marisha were level elitists for two more games  matt basically scanlans turns over vax youre up  liam i have a rules question dm 
none	 normally when i attack one character one attack gets sneak  attack but can i sneak attack the one behind me and attack the other one thats by keyleth ive  got friends around both  matt you can attack them both but you only can sneak attack once per round  liam on one okay then im going to shank backwards to the one behind me and its flanked  theres four of us around it so advantage on this one  matt well lets go ahead and and look at that wind wall  liam okay  taliesin 
none	 lets take a look at the wind wall  marisha it should only affect ranged attacks it should only affect ranged attacks and gaseous  creatures because i doubled checked that  travis honestly im quite often a gaseous creature  taliesin you are definitely you are practically my textbook definition of a gaseous creature  matt it wont have much of an impact on you youre fine just making sure forcing your hand  through it  liam 23  matt 23 hits are you sneak attacking this one or the other one  liam this one  matt 
none	 okay  liam three plus yelps four equals seven  laura laughs and imitates yelp  taliesin muppet liam  travis that sound  liam 28 on that one  liam yells thats howard dean  matt as you stab through the form dissipates upon impact  liam i was hoping that would happen and then im going to dive and roll around keyleth and stab the  next one  matt as you throw your dagger it does catch the wind wall and gets flung out of the way  liam no i meant to run that way  
none	 matt oh you want to run this way  liam can i run through it  matt okay you can move up to there that you can  liam and attack and that was a 23 to hit  matt 23 does hit  liam which is a big seven  matt seven points of damage to it all right one is destroyed you rush forward and stab the other  one its hard to push through the wind wall to even get to its form you do manage to find  purchase it takes some damage that ends your 
none	 turn it is now its turn it moves into both of  your spaces now well say up against the two of you there  marisha can it do that  matt and its going to whoosh into a whirlwind yeah it can its an air elemental  marisha it can move through the wind  matt the wind wall it can fly up and over it has 90 speed  marisha keep going im going to crossreference that keep going  matt because the wind wall itself if i recall  marisha im just checking nah keep going  
none	 matt im going to check now before i do all these rolls  marisha see how tall it is  matt it is 15 feet high  marisha all right yep  taliesin dueling dictionaries  marisha nope it is 15 feet high youre correct he hops the fence  matt it does hissing wind and swirls around in a whirlwind between the two of you i need both of  you guys to make strength saving throws  liam strength damn it  marisha who me  matt yeah keyleth and vax  marisha what strength  sam you 
none	 have inspiration  liam im going to use luck ugh screw you inspiration die i mean thank you for it but  still screw you im going to use my inspiration on top of that oh yay 16  marisha 19  matt both of you guys succeed so you take half damage  liam damn it gil  marisha goddamn it gil  taliesin mines been rocking i dont know what your problem is  laura of course it has taliesin  marisha youre an anomaly  liam how much damage was that  matt you both take six 
none	 points of bludgeoning damage  liam six okay im dead  matt and you hold your ground it doesnt fling you about its not strong enough its wind its  smaller form unable to push both of you entirely off your feet so well done that ends its turn  vex youre up  laura can i fly over it so that i can shoot down onto it  matt you can actually  laura then as my bonus action im going to have trinket run up and attack it  sam whoa trinket attack something  matt you fly 
none	 up enough where you have a view over the wind wall and take two shots and as a bonus  action trinket will rush up and bite it  laura yeah trinkets going to bite it  sam bite the wind  laura 26  matt 26 hits second attack  laura 14 hit points for trinket  matt 14 so that was trinkets attack 14 points of damage from trinket pushing forward and  growling growling and biting through the middle of it mouth full of glass its not fun but it  does some damage  laura 17 
none	 for my hit  matt hits  laura and then the next one hits its higher  matt okay so two hits roll damage on that  laura okay  travis thats a lot of math  laura i know 20 points for the first one oh plus sneak attack 24 points two of those are  lightning  matt nice  laura counting 14 and then oh i dont get that that time 14 points for the second one  matt up above releasing two arrows you see a spark as they are released from the bow impacting  
none	 into it you see trinket tear into its form every now and then you see an arm of vax swing through  and keyleths trying to push her way out of the elemental right now its this mix of swirling  dirt and wind but its seemingly being worn down the speed in which its swirling in its space is  beginning to slow and images within its form are getting easier and easier to see that brings us  back to the top percival  taliesin how far away is it  matt its about 35 feet from you 
none	  travis come on wind killer  taliesin god im going to pull out the gun and start laying waste to it im going to reload and  take two shots with sharpshooter  matt okay  taliesin oh no now that jinxes it see thats better look at that thats lovely 26 and 23  matt both hit go ahead and roll damage  travis somewhere else in the universe the balance is no more  liam whos missed  laura me i missed i rolled a one  marisha we wonder why theres the west nile virus  
none	 travis because he got a roll thanks taliesin thanks obama  taliesin 46 points of piercing damage  matt 46 total  taliesin yes  matt these are all with sharpshooter right  taliesin there were two shots with sharpshooter which is a base of 16 times two so thats 32  plus i rolled a ten on that which pushes it to 42 plus a four so 46  liam is that all  matt even halved from the impact you manage to blast the creature its form hitting the wind wall  and scattering against it no longer 
none	 physically able to hold its form there the elemental  dissipating into the sky in the end  marisha percival he who breaks wind  laughter  taliesin that was for you now i feel guilty  matt as you all take a moment to catch your breath and look around everyone roll a perception check  liam natural 20  sam natural 20  taliesin natural one im cleaning my gun im not even looking  sam wow two 20s two ones so far  laura 22  marisha 15 right in the middle  matt you guys take 
none	 a moment and glance around it appears that whatever disturbed wind brought this  sudden attack on has dissipated and the creatures youve slaughtered have brought this calm  stillness to the beach all you can hear around you is the occasional wave sound of the water up  on the shore it does not appear that there is any immediate danger on the beach  marisha i suddenly remember the letters that i stole from the ship and i say percival and i  pull them out  taliesin thank you  marisha im not giving them to you 
none	 im going to look at them with you  matt they are sketches and designs one of which is of a more refined pepperbox  marisha okay upon looking at them i dont get it and i hand them to him  matt okay you glance through there are other variations of retort the pistol that she had  before you also see a few very complete sketches of a bad news rebuild not as good even looking  at the design you can see a few faults in it that prevent it from being as powerful as what youve 
none	  created nevertheless it is a fairly highpowered riflelike weapon beneath them you see notes of  five constructed and then its erased two on hand  taliesin okay im putting this away and not thinking about this for a little while  matt its like a ledger keeping tabs of each thing that shes created  marisha that was for bad news  taliesin i believe that was for bad no its the pepperbox i believe  liam i want to take a little run towards the water and then shoot out and do what i was trying  
none	 to do before  matt okay so fluttering  taliesin scanlan can you use your very very delicate sword and put some very very gentle  difficulttosee holes in both of these boats  sam sure im a master swordsman i draw my blade talk to me baby  travis talk to me goose  matt as you say baby the voice has this baby this low tuning fork vibration hits the  blade as you begin to go nuts on this ship you guys watch as splinters of wood go flying  taliesin that was not what i had 
none	 in mind straight delicate stabbing  sam oh great yes  matt you put quite a number of pincushionlike blows to the exterior of the ships bow neither  of these will last much in the water  taliesin did we actually end up searching the boats for everything or did we not end up  searching the boats for everything  matt you were about to when this happened  sam wait those elementals that we fought were they left by ripley was it a trap did we  activate a trap is she close by she cant have 
none	 gotten far  laura it looks like she dragged whatever she found further into the island can i call trinket  over and then look at the tracks and see if he smells anybody and see where they took  everything  matt make an investigation check  taliesin does anyone else want to take a short rest  marisha do we have time  taliesin wheres she going  sam what if shes teleporting out of here  laura 15 for me should i roll for trinket too for his smell perception  matt yeah well this is investigation 
none	  laura oh okay i was seeing if he could catch their scent  matt yeah then roll a perception check for trinket  laura and hes got advantage on smell 25  matt as youre looking about you see the tracks you also see in some of the grooves where this  heavy object was being dragged you see one portion where its dragged up or seems to have  been dragged up onto a shelf like a very small sixinch shelf of glass you can see a scrape and  some splinters of wood whatever was being dragged 
dung	 appears to be wooden and part of it was very very  faintly damaged when it was dragged up onto the shelf so you know youre looking for something  made of wood the wood slivers as you look at them theyre a little swollen and damp  laura waterlogged for sure  matt whatever these were they were underwater for a period of time trinket goes sniffing  growling and leans the head forward towards the jungle  taliesin all right  laura you also have that dog they can maybe team up and have extrastrong smell perception or 
none	 we  can save it  sam i dont know why im saying this but i trust trinket  taliesin you want to keep the dog for later dont you  sam yes  laughter  sam wait should i heal you percy  taliesin that would be lovely im bleeding over everything  laura oh well ill do one too  liam heal his face his face is cut up i say over the earring  taliesin that is so kind of you to say  sam ill heal everything but his face lets see here  laura do 
none	 you have a strong heal  sam no im terrible its tiny  laura all right ill do a 2ndlevel and ill touch your face so i can heal all the little glass  shardy things  taliesin oh thank you ow  sam i will do a 2ndlevel healing word as well which is what 2d4  matt 2d4 plus six  taliesin thats nine nine is good im a little better  laura 17 for me  taliesin thank you  sam oh wait before we charge off into the jungle didnt you get a shitton of potions 
none	 can  you hand those out please  laura yeah totally  liam am i seeing anything out on the water  matt the ship is sunk you do not see anybody currently swimming in the water make a perception check  liam that is a 22  matt 22 looking about you can see the bits of the reef that are slightly visible through the  murky water surface here in the bay but the ship is gone you can see bits of floating broken wood  from the impact of the ship its probably going to end up 
none	 as driftwood on the beach itself no  sign of any survivors  liam all right ill shoot back  matt you do see two figures out towards it that are floating in the water facedown  liam oh yeah  sam check them for traps  liam im going to go drag them back  matt okay youre not going to be able to drag both of them with the wings  liam but one i can  matt one you could yeah  liam i will drag one back  marisha oh youre going to drag my shame 
none	 into shore  matt basically yeah  liam your shame you mean your pride i drag one back  matt all right you grab one and its hard you can barely get any lift especially since hes so  soaked with the water its an extra weight  liam can i stay close to the surface of the water  matt i will ask you to go ahead and make an athletics check  liam all right  laura scanlan take a greater and a regular healing potion percy take a greater and a  regular  liam just an 
none	 11  matt youre barely able to keep from being dragged into the water it takes you a while to  get there because he doesnt ever actually leave the water youre pulling him through it as you  go it takes you about 15 minutes to get him into shore if you do  liam im going to imagine that my wings bamf out soon after that  matt yeah youre getting pretty close to the end of your time with those  liam im going to search him hes dead yeah  matt yes make an investigation check 
none	 you guys watch as vax swings in with the wings dragging a  waterlogged seemingly unconscious or dead body throws it onto the beach and begins rifling  through the pockets  travis ooh whatd you find  liam that is a 22  matt 22 you find 145 gold pieces  sam oh hello  liam thats the first gold ive had in ages  matt you find a spyglass and you find two small reddishpurple stones that are perfectly spherical  in the pocket  sam what is that all about whispering they were playing marbles  liam 
none	 all right  matt okay thats all you find  travis whats that thingy pointing to the spyglass  liam thats a you know what that is percival what is that  taliesin its a spyglass i assume yes here you can look through and you can see that  everything is very far away  sam it looks small now everything looks tiny  taliesin just like you thank you  marisha so wait what are the two marbles  liam that ive got in my pocket  laura can you pass the spyglass over i think that would 
none	 be great on the broom  taliesin i think thats a good idea  laura im going to keep this spyglass  liam isnt that for looking through  travis do you have one of those on your big bad news  taliesin i do its not quite as powerful as that although that is an interesting idea i  might play with that later  laura ooh can i fly up in the air and look through it down at the ground see what i see  matt fly up glance out make a perception check  laura do 
dung	 i get advantage because of the spyglass  matt the dc will change based on what youre looking for  liam i take the two small stones and i look over at percival and keyleth and go  laughter  liam those look valuable to you  laura 24  marisha they look like rocks  matt you have a closer look of the canopy of this jungle you basically make out the same details  that grog did earlier there are bits of green there are bits of live tree here and there but  most of its dark 
none	 and dead  laura what if i follow from where the path that i saw them dragging and i follow through the trees  can i see a path inward from there  matt you see from this distance there is occasionally a break in the jungle or a path that  could be taken that isnt completely overgrown and too thick to walk through but thats all you can  make out from this distance  taliesin thatll do im examining one of the red rocks does it look like anything the red circle  spheres  matt it 
none	 looks almost like a polished red quartz imperfect you can see texture cracks or layers of  a natural forming quartzlike material on the inside  marisha so its like a stone is it pretty  matt its like a larger marble of stone  laura are they magic  taliesin probably  laura can we arcane them arcane check  sam ill take a look at these for arcana  matt make an arcana check  laura no grog dont eat it  liam you can have it  sam oh 19 plus stuff plus seven  matt these 
dung	 dont get used too often theyre usually used more in emergency nautical  circumstances or used as a means of gaining attention its called a flare stone and  essentially theyre impacted hard and then thrown high and they turn into a flare  laura is that what we saw oh so he wasnt a magic user  marisha thats cool  taliesin well he was because he was starting a spell  marisha theyre flares thats cool  liam hey pass that back thats mine  taliesin we should spread them out everyone should not have  laura i 
none	 take the purple one you take the red one  liam no you take them both  laura why do i take them both  liam youve got the broom  taliesin youd need one and someone else take the other  laura ill keep the purple one  taliesin let the twins have them because theyre the ones who will get separated  marisha that was the perfect interaction  travis grog remembers that  laughter  taliesin its a way to call for help grog i dont think youre going to need it very often  travis i 
none	 take off sullenly towards the trees  taliesin im going to follow hes got the right idea  matt trinket catches up to you trinkets running alongside you following the smell sniffing you  guys watch is everyone  taliesin im going  matt okay all right you guys push forward reaching the treeline and then pushing into the  jungle itself the smell of the saltwater air gives way to now the smell of ash and burnt  forest but old very faint its less of a recent burn and more an everpresent scent of dead brush  you 
none	 do catch the occasional sour smell of a tropical flower you do see bursts of ground brush  and living plant life that has pushed through the glass and is slowly retaking the island over time  marisha can i keep an eye out for that flower  matt yeah and you see it a few times it has a yellowish milkywhite color to it and it has a  vibrant purple stamen that protrudes from it its almost a sour milktype smell its not very  pleasant  marisha i grab a few put them in my bag  
none	 matt okay you continue pushing through the petrified forests you guys pick up and trinket  picks up as well as youre pushing on for another 150 feet or so you start noticing broken  branches you see little elements that youre used to in tracking movement from individuals you can  see what are sheer signs of heavy footfalls occasionally another grinding along the ground it  looks like whatever was being dragged has now been seemingly picked up or is now leaving less of an  impact it has more people now working towards moving it that groove 
none	 is subtly vanishing as it  progresses but you do see signs of people pushing through the jungle at a rapid pace  liam are the twins quietly in the lead  matt right now its grog and trinket in the lead if you guys want to change up marching order  for this lets do it  liam yeah buddy bud youre very big and large and amazing what do you want  laura he wants one of those balls to put in his butt  liam i give him a small piece of glass from the ground and 
none	 i put it in his hand then i run up  ahead  travis i grab his collar i pull him back  liam try it buddy  laughter  liam give me a dexterity check matthew  matt make a strength check or an athletics check grog you make an acrobatics check  liam all right acrobatics yeah thats fine  travis 25  liam 30  sam you still have inspiration grog  travis oh i do 35  yelling  liam wait im going to use luck no didnt go up  matt you dart forward grinning

none	 beneath his footfalls  laura that is not okay  taliesin i just had this weird thought do i smell anything do i taste anything in the air is  there minerals i had this horrifying notion are there signs that this island has even been vaguely  inhabited at all recently how many people does it feel like are here  matt make an intelligence check  taliesin see if youre going where im going on this  marisha yeah i second that question  taliesin 12 straight  matt its hard to tell from the beach the only 
none	 sign of any activity that hasnt been washed away  by the elements was the campsite that you saw and that was relatively fresh you gather probably  from the rather rapid rate of rainfall that storms through this area that a lot of any sign would be  washed away over time however you guys flew over in the skyship and as you cased the island you  did not see any pockets with villages you didnt see areas of the jungle that have been harvested  for resources  taliesin im going to keep my senses aware as 
none	 possible for the signs of a mining operation  matt okay  marisha and can i keep my senses aware for aboriginals of the island  matt okay so you guys are keeping tabs on anything around you that might be a sign  laura im keeping my senses aware for if ripleys invisible and is around us  matt okay  sam i am looking for literally nothing  taliesin and you find it  matt i will guess in this point one everyone roll a stealth check if youre stealthing  forward  travis im looking for rabbits 
none	  matt glass rabbits  marisha natural 20  travis hey 17  taliesin 14  sam seven  liam 25  laura 28  matt all right the halfelves catch up on this as youre making your way towards this knotted  section of the jungle this is the stealth check right yeah you guys are pushing forward you  guys without a single touch of sound a little bit from scanlan but as the bulk you guys manage to  stop him and as a group push forward you imagine fairly unseen pretty proud of vox  machina 
none	 grog especially being the one that stomped forward you continue to push forward  everyone make a perception check  sam all right new dice three  taliesin ten  marisha 22  liam 26  laura ooh 30  travis six  matt the halfelves once again coming through with the skill checks you guys being quiet and  being careful and methodical in pushing past brush without damaging anything vex keeping an eye on  signs of movement and the more you push forward you start seeing some of the branches that are  broken have less dust 
none	 or general settling material on them youre coming upon something relatively  recent  travis question  matt yes  travis is the ground still covered in glass  matt there are bits of dried brush but there is still a very glassbased floor here  laura is it broken glass or smooth glass  matt there are sections of it that are smooth there are sections that are broken you can see  the further in you get the less that it appears to be a jagged broken experience but it does  vary depending  liam but we 
none	 can navigate through  matt you can navigate through carefully as you move  marisha and does the vegetation seem to be getting thicker  matt its pretty thick theres small breaks here and there but for the most part there arent  carved paths through the jungle here theres natural clearings and you guys have to find your  way through sometimes it gets tight and you have to move around some of the larger trees but  youre able to navigate without a huge issue its not terribly choked off  the halfelves as you guys are quietly 
none	 pulling forward you pick up on what sounds like whispers  hushed voices at least what do you do  laura i have a couple vials of poison can i dip a few arrows in the poison  matt sure  laura does that make poison arrows  matt the arrows would be poison yes  liam i will come back i promise do you want me to go look ill come back ill just go look i  promise  marisha whispering you got this  laura whispering be as quiet as fucking possible  marisha whispering i believe

none	  laura im going to be behind him  matt all right so vax is going ahead  travis ill allow it  laughter  liam imitating grog dont make a sound  matt vax is going forward  liam oh im stealthing onto a battlemap  matt vex you are staying behind him  laura yeah  matt are you going along with her are the two of you going forward or are you letting him go  ahead  laura im going to stay behind him  matt back with the group or with him hes moving ahead 
none	 of everyone else  laura how much farther ahead are you going  liam my proposition was to leave you all and go look and come back to look  laura that always works out every time go for it  quietly go for it  matt make a stealth for trinket by the way too because you forgot to do that  laura what  matt roll a stealth for trinket because youve got to do that too  laura well i figure when i go too stealthy i pop him in my necklace but okay  matt well 
none	 then trinket is popped into your necklace if you wanted to go with that probably  safest  laura yeah for stealthy times  matt so marching order is vex whos behind vex  sam im in the backback  matt okay scanlans holding up the rear  taliesin then i suppose it would be grog me and keyleth maybe  travis yeah  matt grog behind vex  travis yeah  matt and then keyleth and percy behind that and then scanlan vax as you stealth up ahead you  liam can i use detect evil  sam detect

none	 times equal to one plus your charisma  modifier  matt right the paladin ability  liam thats right three times i can do it in a day fancy me  matt all righty you stop and concentrate at the end of your turn all right you do not sense any  celestials fiends or undead  liam oh okay good thing that im being quiet so im going to still creep toward the whispers  matt you scoot ahead and there is a small break you see that groove reappear in the center of this  break and you 
none	 see three figures on the other side of this seemingly in a conversation  liam what do they look like  matt you see to the back holding a large wooden crate and is currently leaning against it and  impatiently looking at the other two figures a female goliath with a heavy scratched scar across  her face head shaved bald she has a shield slung over her back and a big sword currently sheathed  over her shoulder she looks wounded a little bit theres a little bit of blood trickling down the  face and then right 
dung	 in front of the crate you see a younger man with a dark hood up and cloak  arguing with another woman wearing a very intricate cloak with a sparkling blue interior  darker brown hair pulled into a very tight bun in the back with streaks of white in the back and  familiarlooking weapons dangling from her belt youre too far away to hear anything but you do  see them  liam so goliath ripley and the third what does the third look like  matt its too hard to see from this distance looks humanoid  
none	 liam i go back  matt okay  liam and i go directly towards percival quietly she is there  sam what  taliesin shushes  liam whispering shut the fuck up  sam whispering okay  liam quietly she is there grog theres a big woman of your breed there and a third i dont  know what i dont know if its a he or a she i dont know who it is  sam thank god  laura quietly what do we do charge in guns blazing  taliesin whispering i say we put her down  
none	 sam what  taliesin quietly i say we put her down as quickly thats right we have to stage whisper  this is fine lets all assume that everyone cannot hear us  travis quietly do we know what the vestige that she has does  taliesin quietly we dont  travis quietly so what can we immobilize her with  marisha we do know for whatever she has blocked my scrying so whatever it is blocked my magic  taliesin shes probably immune to magic  liam from my vantage point that i had how far away was i 
none	 from them  matt you were about 100 feet from them you were on the outside of that slight open clearing and  they were in the center of it it looked like there was momentum moving through and they have  stopped to have this argument so you dont know how long until theyre going to keep moving  again  travis quietly how about we take a short rest  liam we can overtake her now if we go right now  travis what about the hamster ball  laura but were not rested  taliesin were going 
none	 to have to take it right now  sam i can go in there on the hamster ball but that doesnt do any  taliesin she might not be catchable  sam i thought she cant be magicked  taliesin whispering she probably cant magic one of the others im going to  travis i can barely hear you  taliesin im going to create a distraction when the distraction happens we all charge and attack  ill shoot her  laura youre creating a distraction why doesnt scanlan create the distraction  taliesin i have a very good distraction

none	 start hearing and you  start hearing some of the conversation you hear ripley loudly whispering look ive been  carefully setting my scheduling on this and we have at least 15 to 20 minutes before they arrive  the thug turns to her and says you also said they wouldnt be arriving to the island for  another day or so we dont have time to drag our prize to the transport site  anna returns immediately with a you are a fool to argue with your superior child i hired you as a  bodyguard nothing more i 
none	 plot you protect if this doesnt suit you allow me to fire you from  service she pulls one of her guns out and cocks it and points it  he goes no i mean no disrespect but we must begin setting a trap here now if we hope to stop them  liam is that a he or she that im hearing  matt its a he anna says you arent wrong luska take the relic to the others at the  mountain well wait here and prepare for our pursuers  and the goliath reaches down and begins 
none	 to grab the box and goes you mean use the relic against them  anna says it may be too dangerous given we know little about it let me think as this is  happening you hear a cracking in a nearby brush and all of a sudden they both look over in the  direction as a goliath holding an axe is visible behind one of the trees  yelling  laura i fire we all fire  matt laughs okay so whos firing right now okay you you and you  sam im releasing a dog  matt

none	 own ways  taliesin i am in agreement that on that level all debts are settled and fair however i believe  we have some previous debts to still settle  matt i have no interest in the petty tyranny of drakes and dragons every great beast that has  asserted dominance through history has fallen to the ingenuity of man i worry not what youre after  taliesin you are so dull  matt the other races percy and you know this in your heart they lack our dynamic ability to  adapt to build upon failure so quickly 
none	 that success becomes an inevitability i have faith you  will all succeed in your mission so long as you keep your precious whitehaired boy in the lead  taliesin you two really follow her are you idiots  matt the man with the dagger out glares off at you in the distance make a perception check  actually  laura who  matt everybody right now  sam 16  taliesin 12  marisha 19  liam 22  laura 32  sam jesus  travis you coming here  sam whispers whispers  laura oh god things are

none	 now and well discuss terms im not actually sure i could double it  but i could definitely make it worth your while right now it would be hilarious shes awful  matt look percival  taliesin oh are they moving behind you do you know you cant see they really dont like you  do they know what you did to my family do they have any idea what you do to the people that you  stay with  matt as youre talking she cuts through your voice to him and says dont worry percy our  toys 
none	 have already made the rounds i sold a couple in vasselheim and a few more in ankharel  partially because i needed the money but also because he told me it would drive you mad  taliesin how many have you sold  matt were looking at six and the instructions for creation to two other seemingly very curious  and upandcoming tinkerers like yourself  taliesin sighs well i guess ill have to live with that i open fire  matt okay  marisha oh my god  matt go ahead and roll this combat has halted and now 
none	 its progressing again  taliesin im going to do a she really pissed me off im so sorry  liam id like to throw at her again as well  travis what are you apologizing for  taliesin okay im going to spend a deadeye shot on this which is a bad news shot with a deadeye  with the hex by the way she is at disadvantage on strength checks the hex is probably not going  to do a damn thing i dont even know why i bothered magic fucking cloak with sharpshooter  i am so nervous 
none	 natural fucking 20  laura and marisha cheering  matt thats your attack roll your attack  liam i rolled a 37  matt okay you fire and the dagger gets thrown the dagger passes through her form your bullet  has no effect you watch as ripley smiles and lowers her head both her and the figure that were  standing vanish from sight theres a streak of bright light from the distance as a small beam hits the  center and detonates in a small fireball which then causes the ground to suddenly rumble and  explosion erupt 
none	 in an explosion of white light and force everybody but percival for a moment  you are tossed with the blast of a hundred hammers across your body and face your vision is faded as  you hear the sound of thunder but inches from your ear numbness takes over your form i need all of  you to roll a dexterity saving throw  liam does evasion factor into this  matt it may  taliesin did the hex actually take then wouldnt i have noticed  matt you threw it over there it seemed to cause a smoky 
none	 apparition but no effect  travis gil this is on your fucking dice natural 20 on the second one  marisha did you say we have no he has advantage  matt he has advantage on dexterity saving throws  travis i have danger sense  sam does the dog need to make a dex save  matt the dog would yes  sam how do i do that for the dog  matt how many hit points does the dog have  sam six  matt even if the dog made it the onyx dog that reformed into a 
none	 small object is now flung from a  large fiery explosion dexterity save  sam 14  taliesin 17  matt percy you actually no actually you should make it too from the sheer force  everybody makes it  marisha 12  liam 28  laura 15  travis natural 20  matt okay so grog you manage to leap out of the way as you begin to see the fireball explosion  thats just out of the range it hits in the center here and doesnt hit anybody but in a  split second you watch as certain 
none	 things in the ground catch flames and explode from underneath  the ground itself erupts like something deep beneath the earth bursts outward grog you take  32 points of fire damage  travis wow fuck  matt vax you manage to dodge out of the way behind a tree the tree of which is blown past  you and you duck out of the way but it takes the brunt of the damage you take no damage with your  evasion the rest of you take 65 points of fire damage  sam nice  travis who took the 
none	 full smack oh my god  marisha wow we walked right into that one  travis did the goliath  matt the goliath probably took some damage too chuckles trinket also takes the damage by the  way roll a reflex save  laura trinket was on the ground wasnt he  matt yep  laura dexterity 21 for trinket  matt grog is not blasted prone managed to catch himself  laura 21  matt 21 trinket takes 32 points of fire damage  laura good because if he had taken the full thing he would have been unconscious 
none	  matt as the ringing subsides from the blast you all were thrown dozens of feet from your current  placement most of you onto your back aside from you vax and you grog actually trinket would  have caught himself as well you now see a giant crater in the ground with rock and rubble and  shards of glass tossed around you the trees in the center have been blasted out and you can see  a number of broken trunks and roots curved up with little bits of fire and flame burning off their  edge what 
none	 little bit of burnable material still remained on some of the living trees the smell of  heavy gunpowder recently burned sits in the air as the giant cloud of smoke rises up in the center of  the jungle at this point in time the goliath has stepped forward from the brush as well as two  other figures off to the side wielding longbarreled riflelike weapons  there are a few other figures on this side as well  sam oh my god  matt and actually you dont see that one and ripley steps out of the 
none	 bushes from the side  travis where is she  matt over there  laura oh so they are there  matt the opposite side this is a heavy groove in the ground these are the only parts of the land  that still stand at normal ground height the rest of this is a giant slope that goes into a crevasse  and rises back up  liam vegetation is gone here right  matt vegetation in that area is completely gone and there is broken rock and glass everywhere  laura how deep is the crevasse  matt 
none	 its about 20 feet deep at its deepest  liam and everybody sees everybody right  matt everybody sees everybody right now i need you all to roll initiative  groaning  marisha all right overweight dont fucking fail me now thats all right  travis come on gil natural 20  sam wow you like that dice  marisha is that gils dice again  taliesin its been doing fine for me  sam its been hit or miss  marisha yeah same here  taliesin although i will admit i rolled gold for this roll  sam i

none	 20 that was a lot of damage buddy  marisha yeah you have to roll above your damage oh my god shut the fuck up  sam a different dice too  matt jesus christ taliesin somehow in the blast as your eyes flicker to and you immediately  shoot up from the ground in a sitting position your eyes immediately focus on ripley appearing  from across the way from across the crevasse and that little lingering scar of orthax in the back  of your head maintains the anger of your hex you would have to designate it 
none	 onto her next turn but  you still maintain the spell  taliesin my hate lives  marisha youve got this  liam fate hate whichever six of one half a dozen of the other  taliesin oh man that felt good  matt top of the round is percy  taliesin okay where was i  matt you are over here on your ass right now  taliesin im going to stand up  matt thats half your movement there youre right at the edge of where the ground breaks and  falls in  taliesin thats fine whats 
none	 the distance is it only bad news distance or am i within 400  matt youre within 400 yeah  taliesin so i can actually put bad news away and actually deal with this  matt yeah if youd like to  taliesin they probably all have much higher theyre going to have initiative up the wazoo so  im going to okay no im going to pull the big gun out again give it a reload and give it a shot  right at ripley ive got the hex on her  matt so you move the hex over 
none	 to her with your bonus action shes now officially hexed  taliesin lets pick a fun disadvantage lets see lets give her a dexterity disadvantage  matt dex disadvantage got it  taliesin all right first thing im going to do is im going to do a standard shot at her with a  leg shot im going to try and knock her prone  matt okay go for it  taliesin no sharpshooter thats 26 to hit  matt thatll hit she has to make a strength save is it  taliesin she has to make a strength saving 
none	 throw  matt that is a 19  taliesin against a dc of 19  matt she makes it it doesnt knock her prone it hits her in the foot she almost falls over roll  damage  taliesin make sure im rolling all the right dice thatll do thats six plus ten 22 points  of damage plus three points of necrotic damage  matt nice gunshot the blast hits the leg it almost knocks her onto the ground but she catches  herself against the tree right behind her and pushes herself into place  taliesin thats funny 
none	 im going to burn an action surge and im going to shoot her two more times  because its funny where is she whats behind her  matt it is a tree about ten feet behind her  taliesin im going to hit her again with an attempt to knock her down im going to burn  another grit for that that is 32 to hit  matt 32 to hit thatll hit  taliesin not quite as good 14 points of damage plus three points of necrotic another strength check  matt another strength check this one she does 
none	 not make as she readies herself you fire a  second time and it hits her foot you can see a spatter of blood off the side she falls and slams  down on the ground taking three points of piercing damage landing onto the broken glass and the  rubble around her  taliesin just for fun no then thats just her bonus action for that although that would be  pretty funny im going to hit her one more time with a sharpshooter shot do i get a bonus to hit  her because shes on the ground 
none	 or no  matt actually because shes on the ground its at disadvantage any ranged attacks against prone  people  taliesin even with sharpshooter even with standard sharpshooter bonus of ignore  threequarter cover  matt its not so much cover its more the fact that theyre a smaller target to hit because  theyre closer to the ground  taliesin so the full range sharpshooter ignore threequarter cover would not cancel that out  matt its not cover that gives her the bonus  taliesin the whole theory being that its easier to hit smaller targets  matt 
none	 right it affects cover it doesnt affect her being a smaller target in general to hit its  the way the rule works  taliesin thats okay shes down what am i going to do im not even going to pretend ill burn a  point of grit to also ignore that  matt okay there you go its a straight attack roll  taliesin thats probably not going to hit lets see 14  matt 14 does not hit it scoots past her and slams into the tree behind her you see the  splintering of petrified bark  
none	 taliesin i throw my gun behind on my shoulder and im going to head to my right to try to get  some cover with that tree  matt around keyleth  taliesin yeah around keyleth  laura jump over her prone form  marisha my dead body  matt that ends your turn percy  taliesin yes  matt grog youre up  travis i look to the crater in the ground and i go whoa and i would like to rage can i in 50  feet get to  matt regular rage or frenzied rage  travis

none	 definitely hit  travis nice 33  matt 33 points of damage  travis no im sorry 33 to hit for the second one  matt oh i see they both hit go ahead and roll damage  travis 29 with five points of necrotic damage  matt nice so 34 you actually did more second strike  travis im sorry 29 includes the five points of necrotic damage im so sorry  matt its all right 29  travis second one total of 22 with another five points of necrotic  matt as you rush up and hack into 
none	 him with the blade angry your jaw clenched in anger the  gunner is pushed back each blow gashing into his chest you can already see the crimson line of each  slash across his armor folding away from the impact hes trying to get the hell away from you  does that end your turn  travis i say thanks for the warmup and thats my turn  matt next up is anna ripley she stands up from her space angrily and goes thats all right we  can finish the job she brings her hand up and begins 
none	 casting a spell on herself she finishes  casting the spell a weird outline begins a goldlike shimmer across the edges of her  shoulders youre not quite sure what it means you watch as her right metallic hand detaches and  hits the ground you watch as a flare of purplishblack energy begins to swirl off her  shoulders and where the arm was now you see a giant shadow claw emerge you see a shadow begin  to encompass around her another pair of shoulders and glowing yellow eyes over her form as she says  i found 
none	 a new friend recently seems he doesnt like being abandoned  sam shes the antipercy  travis thats where well pick it up next week  taliesin thank you for watching critical role brought to you by poor decisions  matt with that she vanishes  liam chickens are all coming home to roost  laura can i say how much i wish pike was here right now  liam yeah seconded  marisha i third that  travis yeah we miss pike  matt this gunner here is going to aim at you vax while this one is going 
none	 to attempt to step  away from grog go ahead and make your attack of opportunity on him  travis this is reckless 29  matt that hits  travis 20 points including three points of necrotic 20 total  matt nice as he runs away you hack again this time across the back of the shoulders he arcs in  pain hes looking a little rough but still keeping up he stumbles away turns around whips  the rifle behind and goes to fire at you with it it has advantage on you because you reckless  attacked thats 
none	 a natural 20 on the second roll with the rifle its 2d10  taliesin i should mention i suppose that these rifles are probably very breakable  matt 42 points of piercing damage to you grog from the crit because you are raging and its not  magical thats halved so you take 21 points of damage  liam thats eight percent of your hit point pool  marisha if we can all get together i actually brought heal today because pike wasnt here  matt going to reload the rifle and then go for another strike with advantage thats 
none	 17 plus  ten so 27  travis yep thatll hit  matt next hit is 13 points of piercing damage reduced to six the other gunner aiming at you vax  liam disadvantage because of the cloak  matt yes and it rolled a one and a 19 the first shot goes clear it hits your form but your form  shimmers  taliesin wouldnt a roll of a one with a rifle misfire  matt yeah its going to the rifle immediately gunfire smoke starts pouring out it you see  the metal is bent now and he 
none	 chucks it to the side turns and pulls out a small pistol and is  going to take two shots at you with disadvantage thats five plus ten 15 misses second shot  misses turns the barrel goes to fire a third time with disadvantage six and a 19 nope the  third one fires and each ones hitting your form but your image shifts around it no impact its  going to step back into the bush here try to get out of sight that guys going to stay over there  that ends their turn vex youre up 
none	  laura where am i  matt youre over here flat on your ass looking up at the open space where a bunch of tree cover  used to be that is now blown open the sky is visible  laura well i stand up what are those circles next to trinket what are those  matt these are some trees that survived the explosion that are singed and burned this is a  trunk approximately this big underneath  laura would i be able to hide behind that  matt using half your movement to get up you would 
none	 have 15 more feet so this is as far as you  could get but you could use your bonus action to dash if you wanted to because youre secondlevel rogue  laura okay ill do that and dash and hide behind the tree  matt you dash but you cant roll a hide as well unless you want to use your action to do that  laura well i want to get behind the tree so its still coverage right then can i shoot from there  matt you can yeah so long as somethings in range  laura

none	 know i have half movement  matt you have three you can get behind trinket  marisha ill get behind trinket and im not looking good  matt grog after you see the guy back up and you start lurching forward you faintly hear out of  the corner of your ear a rustle and your eye turns over just in time to see a hooded figure  leap out with a blade in hand towards you from behind that is going to be with advantage  against you 26 to hit  travis that hits i have danger sense 
none	 advantage on dex saving throws dodge traps and spells  matt doesnt help you in this  laura traps and spells  matt yeah which he got advantage on the saving throw  travis 26 hits  matt you feel something cold and painful sink into your back and your muscles tense up you take  marisha im really tapped out not looking good  matt from the sneak attack  travis oh sneak attack  taliesin kill her  matt 28 points of slashing damage  travis halved to 14  matt halved to 14 through your back from

none	 hoping he was a little closer  laura what level spell is that  matt thats a 7th  marisha its like a pink floyd tribute concert  matt that was his big one  laura could he have mistystepped closer to us  matt not with that crevasse unfortunately  travis some would call it a crevase  matt i will fight you truly i will fight you i have two guys fighting you percival youre up  taliesin in theory im able to sense my hex  matt you cant right now no  taliesin im not sensing

none	 bullet hits you see the robed figure the hood flies back you see a man in his 40s with  a chinstrap beard hes still holding his staff keeping himself there  taliesin i am so calm doing this im going to shoot again same thing thats 12  matt 12 does not hit this time you go to fire and the mage now aware of your presence and what  youre firing at him ducks out of the way and it shoots past  taliesin im going to burn a grit and im going to do a torso shot 
none	 because thatll be funny no  sharpshooter  liam percival fan of comedy  taliesin i am it is hilariously funny as possible oh and theres no save for this its  just if i hit come on be cool thats cool enough 21  matt 21 as a reaction the mage is going to throw up a shield spell seeing it coming towards  him adding to his ac the bullet while it should have hit the torso ricochets off an arcane shield  that shimmers briefly in place having no impact unfortunately  taliesin im going to use 
none	 my bonus to have a greater potion thats 4d4 plus four  matt 4d4 plus four yes  taliesin and then im going to make sure that i look the wizard in the eye and im going to yell  to him youre not leaving here alive youre going to die as i reload well i cant reload  yet but ill reload in a second  matt all right that ends your turn percival grog youre up  travis now that ive got two playfellows were on the edge of the crevasse right  matt correct yes  travis 
none	 yeah can i try to push the goliath into the can i go into a frenzied rage as my bonus  action and can i use my first attack to try to shove the goliath into the crevasse  matt youll have to move to push her  travis can i move  matt yeah you shift around that way youd get an attack of opportunity from the rogue  travis worth it  matt and i would say so youre aware usually its like when you go into a rage you choose to  frenzy rage but ive always 
none	 liked the idea of you going into a frenzy if you want to i dont think  it takes an action to do so  travis yeah okay i thought it was a bonus  matt its a bonus action to rage  travis yeah i thought frenzy was also  matt yeah youre fine you go into it all right so youll move  travis yeah just one over  matt one over this way the rogue goes to strike you that is 21  travis thatll hit  matt that hits it is not sneak attack right now 
none	 because he already used it until it comes back to  his turn so you take ten points of piercing damage reduced to five as he swipes at you cuts  barely across your back and you move into place okay now the goliath turns her shield up in front  of you  travis for my reckless attack id like to try and push her into the crevasse  matt okay so the first strike make your athletics check i think  travis nice athletics  mattthis would be your athletics versus hers yeah  travis 27  matt 
none	 you push her back five feet there and you push into that space there first attack she puts  the shield up and as you slam into the shield slides against you see all the glass building up  behind her ankles and tumbling into the crevasse behind her  travis i do another  matt all right go for it roll again  travis yes 23  matt that is a 13 as she stands there with her blade at the ready getting ready to arc down with  the counterattack you slam into her shield and she yells 
none	 falls backward tumbling into the  crevasse down into the pile in the center she takes 15 points of damage from the impact and  the shards of broken jagged glass that are at the bottom of it from the explosion before and shes  like groans on the ground  travis can i look over my shoulder at the rogue  matt yes you can  travis because hes got the little dagger right  matt yeah  travis can i say sit down before i open you up and i would like to take off towards the guy 
none	 that  i was first engaged with thats at the back corner of the map with the rest of my movement i have  one attack left yeah reckless please chef 25  matt yeah thatll hit  taliesin turn him into paste please  travis 17 with two points of necrotic damage  matt 17 you rush up and slash across with the axe he puts up the rifle to try and keep it at  bay you cut through the rifle cutting it in half and the blade impacts in the chest pushes  and pulls the weapon 
none	 out as you pull backward ready for another strike a big streak of blood  pours out from the wound hes standing but looking extremely hurt  laura and his rifles broken  matt all right that ends your turn  travis i have retaliation i forgot about it thats all right  taliesin if he tries to run youll kill him anyway  travis if somebody tries to hit me within five feet with melee i can hit him back but i forgot  to do it  sam even on an attack of opportunity you mean  matt 
none	 yeah he has the ability to use his reaction to attack someone back immediately  taliesin you can only do it once per round  matt once per round yeah all right suddenly whoosh  sam who that  matt ripley reappears ten feet from where she was before and you can still see the smoke pouring  off of her the presence very easy to see of orthax now bound to her the inspiration for her  recent designs in carrying on the legacy that you chose to end and as she appears she goes and  takes aim 
none	 with her refined pepperbox across the way at you percy  taliesin yes she does  sam you get advantage against bullets right  taliesin i dont although i do have cover i dont have full cover i have some cover  matt no you have half cover which is a plus five to your ac she rolled a 28  taliesin thatll hit adds five to my ac currently  matt yes so the first one hits the second strike shes going to spend a grit point to  violent shot that is a 26  taliesin that also 
none	 hits  matt okay and a third strike shes going to headshot you  taliesin thats funny and useless but okay  matt thats all right that was a natural one  laura misfire  matt it misfires the first two shots hit but the third one misfires so with her refined  pepperbox she takes aim gunfire takes a shot actually before she does that she bonus actions  towards you and you feel a similar feeling take over you as you now percy  liam and travis negapercy  sam why dont you marry her  taliesin this 
none	 whole fights going to end with us kissing were going to start making out its  going to be a big ugly makeout  matt so the first shot with this is going to be 12 points of piercing damage from the first  strike plus two psychic as the impact hits you and you feel this shocking ring in your head you  see a flash suddenly in your mind of the darkshadowed face of orthax laughing  taliesin 14 points total  matt yes  taliesin all right  matt second shot which is a violent shot on 
none	 hit has double dice value so thats 18 points of  piercing damage  taliesin im going to try and slow it down with a catch  matt okay plus four psychic  taliesin so im going to try and lower that 18  matt go for it  taliesin ooh i lower it by 14 points  matt okay you catch the bullet and for the most part it still pierces through  taliesin so four points of damage plus four psychic  matt plus four psychic so eight total  sam wow you caught a bullet  taliesin 
none	 they dont move that fast  matt the third gun shit  taliesin laughs im going to be laughing my ass off for a minute  matt and you watch as she goes very well and vanishes again from sight  laura ugh i hate her  liam and laura shes a bitch  matt that brings us to the gunners turn this one here is going to go ahead and its horribly  wounded this one the rifle misfired if i recall  taliesin yes  matt yes and has pulled out a pistol so the gunner here using 
none	 a pistol is going to take  three shots at you vax  liam with disadvantage  matt with disadvantage on them correct well two shots one and then a reload and then one  so the first shot with disadvantage thats a 27 and 24  liam that hits  matt all right so the disadvantage has faded  liam loses it for the rest of the round  matt but still you take from the first hit 12 points of piercing damage and the second strike  without disadvantage is terrible that is a 13  liam im 
none	 fine  matt rolled a three but it did not roll enough to misfire so reload last shot fire misses its  going to run this way  liam oh can i uncanny dodge or is it too late  matt yeah you can do that so half damage all righty the other one whos in front of you grog  and is scared out of his mind is going to attempt to step back  travis well thats one way to die  matt so go ahead and take your he does not want to be in your face 
none	  travis thats 29  matt that hits roll damage  travis can i make that great weapon i have to say that before  matt yeah no its too late  travis 16 points of damage one necrotic  matt 16 you arc back this time you jam it into the leg and you see him now limping one eye is  like half closed and swollen breathing heavy one arm is busted and is still holding the pistol up  and points it toward you hes going to take three shots with the pistol thats already loaded now 
none	  that he got rid of the big gun the first one is going to be shouting 12  travis misses  matt you dodge to the side next shot is 25  travis thatll hit  matt this one will be eight points of piercing damage  travis okay halved to four  matt and this one its going to use all three grit points that it has to do a triple violent shot  marisha wait thats a thing  taliesin that is a thing  marisha a triple violent why havent you done that  matt it 
none	 adds more to the misfire score but it can add to a lot of damage  taliesin no i very rarely use it because its a bad  matt 22  travis hits  laura look did you see how happy he was about this that was the most satisfied smile ive seen  from matt in a really long time  marisha how are you grog are you all right  matt 26 points of piercing damage reduced to half  travis to 13  matt to 13 yeah goes firing at you with the shots and as youre

none	 that you run past in the glass  travis oh six points per square  matt no one point per square  liam thats as far as i get with movement and dash a bonus action dash  matt i kept forgetting the glass aspect of this thats as close as you can get  liam and ill use my action to keep going and as i close in i shout out kynan youre with us you  are not with them you are with me stop this move behind us now  matt you took a total of 18 
none	 points piercing damage  travis whos kynan  marisha is he the one on the thing is he the mage  liam they dont know  matt its going to have to be a climb check to get up next round thats as far as you can get  youre running through the crevasse as you go  liam they dont know  laura i ducked back behind that tree after i shot by the way i ducked back behind the tree  when i shot that person  matt okay there you go all right  liam charisma roll 
none	 persuasion anything  matt for this one as youre ducking through youre shouting it out but you dont even know if  hes really paying attention at the moment all right ending your turn keyleth youre up  marisha all right i am burning my 7thlevel spell and really fucked up behind trinket im  going to think about the air elementals on the beach and what they just did and im going to  cast whirlwind and im going to aim for the mage on the crevasse booby  matt chuckles all righty  liam that mage is right 
none	 on the nip  marisha right on the nip  matt all right so its a tenfoot radius  marisha laughing we ruin everything you make  liam anything you do we will turn into preschool matt  taliesin oh god i just saw it  matt so a tenfoot radius  marisha oh you built this looks like a dick okay  matt im going to kill all of you  travis no dont come on  matt a 30foot high cylinder so youre creating it here  marisha no over on top of the mage i have a 
none	 300foot range  matt all right so you guys watch as the wind kicks up  marisha can i get the guy in the crevasse the 30foothigh  matt you could technically yeah if you want to  marisha yeah ill suck them all up  matt all right so you watch as a cloud begins to appear above and shoots down in an instantaneous  funnel a tornado slams down into this crevasse as keyleths eyes glow her reaching out and  drawing it to the ground all right it sucks up any medium or smaller objects that arent 
none	 secured  creatures make a dexterity saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind or the  whirlwind enters its space so they both have to make a dex save the mage thats an eight thats  a nope  taliesin what a lovely number  matt the goliath thats a 19 and 18 plus one whats your dc  marisha 19  matt it succeeds the goliath does the mage does not  marisha oh the goliath  matt 10d6 bludgeoning damage if you could  marisha what  travis taliesin and matt 10d6 
none	  marisha 10d6 its like christmas one two three four five okay oh thats fine okay so  thats wait what was that what was that taliesin i pushed it was it a two it was a  four okay six plus five is 11 plus four is 15 plus another four is 19 plus another two is 21  taliesin roll them again that was five  marisha that was five  matt 21 plus  marisha not as good this time what did i say 21 26 30 32 35 36  matt 36 bludgeoning damage  taliesin 
none	 and does he get flung  matt the goliath grapples on to some of the shards of broken glass and while taking the  bludgeoning impact manages to stay in place the mage has to make a strength saving throw or become  restrained in the spell until it ends and rolls a two  marisha wait is he restrained or is he flung because its vague on what happens  laura personally i was flung  matt he is restrained restrained means speed becomes zero attack rolls against him have  advantage and it has disadvantage on dexterity saving 
none	 throws  marisha hes stuck in a tornado  matt he can try to use his action to break free and then it is hurled from it but right now it is  currently held  marisha if he tries to break free well thats fun  matt when it starts his turn he begins being pulled up in the air inside the whirlwind  marisha yeah ive never done this before so this is cool yeah  matt its pretty cool all right cool and you can use your move to move the whirlwind 30 feet  so now 
none	 thats hes restrained in it if you move the whirlwind elsewhere he goes with it  marisha can i do that now or next turn  matt you know you didnt use your movement  marisha i didnt  matt you can move up to 30 feet and possibly pick up other things if you want to no one is directly  nearby but you can start moving it in a certain direction if youd like  taliesin we dont actually know where ripley is  laura yeah move it towards where ripley was  marisha thats true where was 
none	 ripley last seen thats probably what i would try to do i would  push it that way  matt okay so leaving behind 25 30 thats where youre going to want to leave it there  currently held up inside that that sucks for you keyleth that end your turn  marisha yep  taliesin can he not do anything while hes in there  marisha hes fucked yeah hes stuck in a tornado  laura unless if it hits ripley does she defuse it  marisha she has to save from it she either gets sucked up in 
none	 it or flung so shes going to get  fucked either way i dont know  taliesin well then wed know where she is  marisha its not necessarily a spell on her i made the spell around her  matt keyleth  marisha what no come on  matt as youre casting the spell and holding aloft the hooded thug the younger man runs  behind and flings a dagger in your direction  marisha kynan little shit  taliesin shes got cover by the way  matt yeah you do have half cover on that which adds  
none	 laura no we cant kill kynan  travis you cant kill kynan  sam kill him destroy his life  laura i cant kill kynan and i apparently cant kill anyone today  matt threequarters cover is plus five it may be plus two for half cover let me doublecheck  taliesin its a tree and a bear  matt ill say its threequarters cover thats fine you get plus five to your ac 24 whats  your ac  marisha i get plus five  matt yeah  marisha that hits  matt that hits still  marisha my 
none	 armor class is 17 plus five so thats 22  matt yeah it still hits you okay so flings the dagger this black curved razorlike dagger  sinks into you currently no sneak attack damage but you do take  marisha i swear to god if he drops me im going to be so pissed  matt 16 points of piercing damage to you  marisha okay all right  matt i need you to make a concentration check just roll a constitution saving throw  marisha what do i have to roll over  matt it would be ten 
none	 or higher dont roll low constitution saving throw  marisha ten total  matt you make it you maintain concentration however as the blade hits you you watch as it  was thrown you notice kynan shifts into shadow and goes after the blade vanishing the blade  strikes you and then suddenly kynans hand appears where the blade stabbed you and he  appears next to you  taliesin where  matt up on the log right there  marisha kynan hey man whats up  matt you see him shaken theres sweat on the face that ends his 
none	 turn it is now the barbarian  not the barbarian the goliaths turn there is going to attempt to make an athletics check to  climb thats enough gets up just barely to the top and thats not going to be enough to really do  much else on her turn unfortunately messed up everything shes been trying to do  liam right up the hill gets kicked back down  travis she has a shield right  matt yeah shield climbs up wipes off the blood from the side of her mouth growls scanlan  youre up  sam 
none	 its a very muddled playing field  matt yes it is  sam and im so far away from everyone im going to yell grog hold on to something man and so  im going to case reverse gravity right there  matt oh shit  sam and get everyone over here  matt all right hold on reverse gravity 100 feet you could totally get it over there 50foot  radius so yeah its going to get  sam and ripley if shes not immune to it  matt you can get everyone in that including grog  sam 
none	 sorry grog  matt grog make a dexterity saving throw with advantage because its against a spell  travis thats not great thats a six  matt nope  sam youre going on a ride  matt the gunner fails the goliath fails interestingly enough the mage is unaffected  because hes not affected by gravity hes currently being held in a whirlwind however go  ahead and at the full 100 feet high everyone hits the very top of it and then you can choose to  then either maintain it or drop them immediately  sam theyre gunners 
none	 right  matt theres a gunner there and then theres the goliath warrior  sam im going to hold them im going to hold in place and lets all go around find ripley  taliesin you can totally do the point break midair combat  travis at terminal velocity  taliesin isnt point break the one where they keep jumping out of airplanes i can never  remember  laura wow that is so high  marisha hell yeah man  sam sorry  travis cool super cool guys super cool  matt they are all currently now screams unable 
none	 to attack unable to really do anything well up  from there  laura just think if it had been percy he would have thrown up  sam other than the mage and maybe ripley everyones off no and the fucker kynan  matt yeah hes over there and theres the gunner over there  sam no that gunner should have been in the radius  matt 50foot radius  sam 50foot radius i cast it right there  matt yeah that would have put ill make a dex save on them that is a 21 what is your dc 
none	  sam 21  matt so just makes it so its barely holding on right now reaches over and grabs part of the tree  and is like groaning  taliesin does that mean he cant fire his gun for as long as the spell is up  matt seemingly yeah  taliesin good to know  travis well im up in the air again of all the people who really shouldnt be in the air im up  in the air again  laura its like dragonball z fighting now  matt currently hes holding on to the branch 
none	 preventing himself from falling upward grabbing a  root and part of a tree and is like yelling stuck there in the moment do you want to move  sam yes im going to move jesus whats the fastest way to get across this stupid crevasse  through it  matt through it or around its up to you  liam get some ouchies in there  sam itll take me like a minute to get all the way around there  laura can you ride on bigbys hand through it  marisha can you dimension door  sam i 
none	 cant do shit while im casting a spell  marisha that sucks man  sam im going to start walking around the circle  matt this way  sam yeah  laura do you have any healing bonus actions  sam i do have a healing bonus action  laura im really low  matt five points of piercing damage to you scanlan as youre running across grogs taken  none because grogs rage essentially halves the one point you take per walk so you dont take any  damage everyone else has been barely moving so theyve been doing 
none	 the half move you take one  point of damage per square you move  sam so youre dying okay so ill turn to vex and ill heal her ill sing singing i heal  you i heal you so bad i heal you so bad its driving me mad its driving me mad  matt what level are you casting it as  sam two  matt 2ndlevel okay so 2d4 plus six  sam ooh 12  matt 12 points healed to you vex all right the mage who is currently held in the whirlwind  lets see 
none	 here  taliesin his options are pretty limited if i recall  liam he diarrheas on himself  matt hes just restrained he can still do things while its in the whirlwind it cant move  attacks against it have advantage  marisha he can just go oh toto  all oh toto totoro  marisha that evolved real quickly what did we just do  laura i have no idea  matt apologies for the delay  laura cool the dice sticks to the magnets on the boxes  travis oh the metal ones  liam apropos of nothing 
none	  matt okay that works so the mage whos currently held aloft and floating about looks  over at the source of the whirlwind puts a hand out and goes grunt you watch as an arc of  lightning arcs over in the direction of keyleth  marisha what  matt it arcs past  taliesin is it going to be able to hit her  marisha no fucking shit he doesnt get thrown what a dick  matt no the throw is when he breaks free of it right now he takes damage where is it  basically it 
none	 just does the damage and then it holds him in place you can basically control  where they are which is the fun of it its restrained and its held within just making sure  im not missing any of the elements here first time in a turn that it enters the whirlwind or the  whirlwind enters its space including when the whirlwind first appears so yeah it doesnt keep  taking damage it is being held aloft right now and you can move it over other guys as you  continue to press through more damage so anyway 
none	 the arc of lightning arcs over 150feet distance  hitting towards you i need you to make a dexterity saving throw keyleth  marisha do i have advantage because im behind trinket or anything do i have cover  matt no it doesnt help you  marisha i have advantage because my armor is resistant against spells right  matt this is true so go ahead and dexterity saving throw  marisha ill take that 12 its not great 17  matt does not help unfortunately its 10d8 lightning damage  taliesin there is no way that the guy whos 
none	 currently got a knife stuck in her isnt going to  get some of this  matt well find out in a second  taliesin just asking  marisha honestly i thought i was going to be able to last around to the next round  taliesin its okay there are options  matt so keyleth you take 59 points of lightning damage  laura oh shit  travis fuck  marisha incredulously i take what  matt 59 points of lightning damage from the chain lightning spell that just hit you  marisha oh wow what kills you in 
none	 this game  liam hitting zeros unconscious and then going past your total hp kills you  marisha i have to go past my total hp  sam negative 115 or something like that  marisha well im negative 58 now  laura no no no youre zero now now its just death saving throws  marisha i just go to zero i dont go negative  liam if you dont go higher past your total hp youre still at zero  laura take it from us weve been unconscious a lot  laughter  laura youre fine  marisha 
none	 but do i still have to count going negative  all no  matt you fall unconscious the whirlwind vanishes thump and the mage falls prone  sam floats 100 feet in the air  marisha thunk does he take falling damage  matt cannot grab onto anything because he was actually lifted up in the air so the mage is now  100 feet in the air  laura gasps yes  marisha yay scanlan yeah  taliesin that is a series of poor life choices  marisha yeah it was  matt however three bolts then leap from 
none	 the target to as many as three other targets so  thats going to be  sam oh shit  marisha ooh jesus christ  taliesin oh shit  matt goes to the first that includes scanlan so scanlan percy and trinket all get a bolt  taliesin highpitched hes not going to get hit because hes touching her at the time that she  gets hit  laura yeah kynan kynan doesnt get hit  matt he chooses the targets so i need percy scanlan and trinket to make a dexterity saving throw  taliesin oh shit this is 
none	 about to get very bad oh thank god  sam do i get to inspire myself on the save  matt not unless you already have inspiration  laura singing six  sam 12  laura oh my god  matt let me see here make sure if its an ability check  sam get ready to fall there grog  travis laughing oh really  taliesin its about to happen  sam its about to happen  travis laughing oh man  marisha remember those breakfalls you practiced like in basketball in high school do that  travis oh

none	 flares up with darkness you watch as the edges of the barrel some sort of script that was carved on  the side of one of the barrels flares away with a purple flash and it seems like some of ripleys  wounds heal a little bit she goes now its time to make an escape and shes going to use a  bonus action to misty step that way and vanish  travis is my axe still in her chest  matt as she runs away the axe drags a bit behind her because of the chain as soon
