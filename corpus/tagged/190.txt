none	 that war had made its way to the empire with the far eastern region  of xhorhas and the kryn dynasty upon this conflict you decided that perhaps it would be  best to leave the central urban environment you decided to dodge a few opportunities brought to  you especially that by the lawmaster of the city and instead went and made a conversation with your  friend the gentleman beneath the city in his underworks there he offered two possible work  opportunities in which you accepted both the first of which is going to send you towards 
town	 the  swamp town of berleben to the northnortheast then from there head far northeast to shadycreek  run to converse with and retrieve an ally of his he had not been able to do business with in a  while you gathered your materials got your wagon and horses made your way northward on the  bromkiln byway toward the labenda swamp along that path you managed to encounter a shackliving  hermited orc of some unknown background continuing northward you slept in a cluster of trees where  you were ambushed by a wandering troupe of goblins and 
none	 ogres upon escaping their clutches and  defeating most of them only one i believe got free you gathered what information you could  managing to keep out of the rain you slept beneath your cart and awaited the next morning as  we come back in you all have had your long rest so if you havent marked that in your character sheet  please do so  sam and we leveled up  matt no  laura yeah level six  matt no that didnt happen as you come to the cold morning greets you the low mist 
dung	 and fog seem  to still clutch the outer edges of the forest trees beyond your peripheral you can just see the  dark shapes of the trunks against the obscured gray the mist and dew that is gathered on the  grass and bits of vegetation near the base of the floor where youve slept has turned to frost with  the cold night most of you managed to complete your rest uncomfortably but awake to chattering  teeth and the shaking of your body except for jester  laura i walk around and crunch all of that frost 
none	 crunching  matt the morning is yours what do you wish to do  travis what you never fucking get cold or nothing  laura i dont think so no  taliesin lets get up and moving  travis yeah please anybody got whiskey or something nott you got any booze  sam of course i do  travis would you mind if i swig  sam sure heres my flask  travis thanks its always full  laura is it always full or it is always almost empty  sam well i cant see inside it so i dont 
none	 know but im sure theres some sort experiment we  could do to its all right you can have as much as you want its endless  laura you dont have to buy alcohol at all anymore  sam no i mean i rarely did anyway i stole it but now i dont have to do that either  laura thats wonderful  sam yeah i think its about twothirds full most of the time  ashley may i try it  sam sure  travis its really good it spreads through your chest like a fire  laura how 
none	 do you decide which alcohol is in it  sam i decided the first time and thats what it is always  laura what if you get sick of it you cant empty it out  sam why would i get sick of it its wonderful  laura what if you want to try a different thing like  taliesin snozzberry  laura yeah  ashley does it only fill up with one kind of alcohol  sam yes it replenishes with my favorite kind of whiskey  travis which is  sam the kind that gets you good and 
tavern	 drunk  travis oh good i didnt know if it had a name  taliesin i tried the other kind before and really its not much  ashley the kind that doesnt get you drunk is not very good  travis good and drunk  liam can you get it empty or close to empty if you try  sam i could try  liam i am not suggesting you try  sam i think its a good experiment  travis i think so too  ashley i do too  sam they already started it  laura maybe we 
tavern	 shouldnt do that right before we go to the swamp where were going to fight people  sam lets just see what happens ill drink a bunch  matt okay you are very drunk  sam did it get lower  liam i grab and shake it with my thumb over the spigot  matt its still filled with liquid i mean you drank a lot and it still feels like halffull  travis should you puke it up  sam slurred i dont want to waste it  laura you cant really waste it  marisha yeah its bottomless 
none	  taliesin youve already used it at this point really  sam slurred i guess i could should i throw up now  laura maybe you should try  marisha in the name of science  sam stick something down my throat  travis nott just put your finger down your throat  laura i find a stick open up  sam yelling and gagging did it work  matt eventually yes  laura i dont want to hurt your throat you know  travis face pointing up though so it projectile bouncing betty vomits everywhere  matt in a 
dung	 very ren and stimpy fashion jester begins jamming this stick into notts gullet  before the brackish brown whiskey comes back up in a mild spray against the nearby now damp dirt  and grass  travis is it steaming in the early morning cold  matt it would be  laura but do you feel better though  sam no not really  liam probably not how is your esophagus after that  sam a little sticky  travis a little salsa  sam yeah  marisha a little burny  liam how many fingers am i holding up 
none	  sam i think four  liam how many members of the mighty nein are there  sam nine  liam shes okay  sam but two are always gone  liam its true  ashley i feel like when i see someone else throw up i feel almost like i do retching no  taliesin no  travis thats a violent reaction  liam jester help her out there shes in need  laura do you want me to stick something down your throat  ashley no i mean i dont know if that will help i think it 
none	 was just gross to see retching  uhoh its still happening  taliesin is it just seeing someone throw up or is it also hearing the sound that makes it worse if  i just went retching does that  ashley yeah i think its the sound too  taliesin okay  liam looking at our map how much longer do i think we have to go to get to our destination  matt if you move quickly you can probably get there right around sunset  marisha is this quickly like not paying close attention quickly  matt its 
none	 not carefully and quietly quickly  travis i think were good for that  marisha yeah were fine  travis were not concerned at all about that  what do you call it when you get ambushed  marisha liam and taliesin ambush  travis last night  sam youre our strategy guy right  travis yep  sam okay  travis its early in the morning im not awake yet  laura we beat them though  taliesin weve been traveling for years weve been ambushed dozens of times  travis im just checking didnt know if anybody was 
none	 alarmed  laura is it normally ogres that ambush you  taliesin no that was new and exciting  ashley especially if were staying on the main path you know well see anything that pops up  travis fair enough  liam we want to rush you want to rush lets take it slow and were going to get to the swamp  just as the sun is going down if we rush and that is full of nasty things im sure  travis thats actually a very good point  liam if we go slower  taliesin we get 
none	 there in the day  liam yeah  travis carefully then  taliesin i dont mind camping out  laura one more time  taliesin one more time  liam you all are an enjoyable lot it will be fun  laura that was very believable caleb  marisha i think he was being genuine  taliesin that was very impressive thank you  marisha i feel like that was the most emotion  laura i think ive ever seen  travis is caleb blushing at all  marisha a little his ears are getting a little pink  liam 
none	 maybe a little  travis all right saddle up them dogies  laughter  laura does anybody else want to drive the cart today or do you want me to keep driving it  taliesin ill drive if you want to switch out later on  laura yeah  taliesin all right i got it nott i assume you want to be in back  matt molly up front keeping the horses on task you guys pick up the pace and get back out of the  forest main cluster and onto the bromkiln byway heading northnortheast once more  
none	 liam carefully  matt are you moving at the slowest pace  laura not the slowest pace  travis medium a five  laura a normal pace  matt singing i drive the cart at a medium pace  liam not willynilly not galloping pace  matt pressing forward what two are maintaining a watch as you progress  laura and liam i want to watch  matt one of you is aiding the other who is helming the roll  laura i want to stand on the cart and stand up for the ride and look around  matt 
none	 its like muaddib riding the sandworm standing up  laura ill put my hands on mollys horns and  taliesin im into this  ashley ill take the back caleb can i hold frumpkin again  laura am i rolling twice  liam twice yes  ashley i like him  taliesin i also do have a large tapestry thats relatively clean if anyones feeling cold  sam thats not good could we make that tapestry into coats  laura nine because its appropriate  matt for the first half of the day you continue along the path it gets 
none	 rough in places and at  one point one of the wheels slams into a rock you have to double check and make sure it didnt take  any damage it seems to be okay  liam we saw that  taliesin i can drive  matt for the first half of the day nothing catches your eye in particular the mist has  burned off at this point and a bit of sunlight is breaking through the clouds it seems the storm  from the evening before has passed you can see now over the mostly gray cloud cover 
none	 there are  breaks in it from this distance you can see these visible beams of sunlight slowly coasting across  the grass fields as you see the heavy high grass pushing and pulling with each burst of breeze that  makes its way across the valley its very beautiful here in the center of the empire its a  very relaxing ride though you know youre bookending your travel with tension to stress so  youre taking this moment to appreciate what it is the empire protects and what the people within are  fighting for in the coming 
dung	 conflict second half if the day same people on watch  marisha and ashley ill take a watch  laura ill sit down ive been standing for such a long time  matt its true give those ankles a rest whos helming the roll  marisha ill helm  matt youre aiding beau roll with advantage  marisha and matt 18  marisha sorry 17  matt 17 all right continuing your pace beau as youre watching out from a northnorthwestern  direction you see a dark shape come over one of the hilltops wide and encompassing  marisha moving 
dung	  matt it seems to be a number of miles out of the way almost on the horizon you can see this  series of rolling hills in that direction that obscure what lies beyond that area you watch as  one of the hills goes dark on top like the coloration gets covered in shade  marisha what does the weather look like are there clouds in the sky  matt there are clouds in the sky especially at this time of year its generally pretty cloudy  here in the empire youve seen breaks in the clouds as 
none	 youve traveled for most of the day its  been warmer than usual so its been a welcome change of pace from what youre used to but this  is not characteristic of cloud cover as most everything here has some level of shade  travis still rolling grasslands or are there trees off to the side  matt there are bits of trees and clusters of them nothing that would be considered a major forest  what you slept in the night before has probably been the largest cluster youve seen in your  travel today so far this 
dung	 catches you  marisha it looks like the landscape is going dark not something moved in front of it or like  something is moving  matt correct best you can tell at this distance  marisha whos got good eyes and knows about clouds and shit  nott caleb knows about clouds  liam ive spent a long time on the road too  marisha does that look natural to you  matt you both look out there and as you travel for the next ten minutes or so you can see faint  glimmers in that moving shadow 
dung	 as a bit of sunlight travels over it its at that moment you  realize what this is its a legion what was a dark shadow appears to be hundreds and hundreds of  soldiers an army regiment that is shifting from the northwestern side of the empire to cross over  the byway heading east as you continue your pace forward you get to a point where you may  intersect with their path if you continue or you can slow down or speed up its your choice  liam there are a lot of soldiers ahead and i 
town	 dont think we should have anything to do with them  laura plus if we wait itll take a really long time for them to cross the road  liam thats a very good point  marisha if we move though we have to move fast and maybe a little bit carefully  laura lets go go  marisha all right  matt with that galloping the horses begin to pick up pace you all grab the sides of the cart  as it begins to whir and kick its way across the street the horses galloping framing the two 
town	  different sides of the cart as you pick up speed you come up over one of the hills and then down  another embankment as you curve around the side theres a part where the grass has overgrown a  large majority of the road here but you coast through the center  laura we should stand up and ride it like a surfboard  taliesin lets not do that  sam like teen wolf  laura yeah  matt make a general animal handling check if you dont mind molly  taliesin seven  matt okay  sam 
town	 thats terrible  matt as you hit that portion of the road youre having a hard time steering the horses youre not  entirely familiar enough to pull on the rein of multiple at a single time to get the shift and  movement they begin to careen a little bit off of the path almost trying to hide into the grass  embankment which slows your movement down ever so slightly before impact one of the wheels  suddenly impact and scraping it is now digging into the ground  taliesin i can desperately try and right the stuff 
none	 i suppose  laura did it break the wheel  matt the cart is now sitting at a backward angle and its slowing down  laura we could climb to the other side of the cart and try to balance it so the wheel comes up  taliesin im going to pull hard on the reins see if i can get it out of the  sam and continue or stop  taliesin oh are we stop stopped  matt its grinding to a halt  taliesin okay im stopping the whole thing really quickly  ashley im going to 
town	 hop off the horse and go look  marisha can i go ahead a little bit and see if i find any hidden paths that might cut through this  field off the main road scout ahead a little bit  matt okay make an investigation check you go and check it looks like some sort of heavy rock  that was hidden and obscured in the grass just off the road had slammed into both wheels on the  left side the front one had bent the wood splintered inward and the metallic rim on the  inside had 
none	 bent inward the other one had completely been pushed inward and knocked at the  angle its pretty wrecked  laura oh no is it fixable  matt do any of you guys have tools to fix a wagon  laura would we know  matt what toolkits would you have at your disposal  liam your background would tell you if you chose a background what bag of shit you have  matt your background may have abilities that could help you in this scenario as well  travis vehicles in water  matt things that are helpful carpenters 
none	 tools possibly thats kind of rough  marisha i have ball bearings  laura i have an axe  travis im pretty sure i saw carpenters tools and i was like who needs that  matt anybody  taliesin ive got a hammer ive got some rope i dont know  matt no  ashley i have rope i have lots of rope  travis i think were going to need to double up on these horses you guys or at least unhitch  them from the wagon  laura yeah and get all of our stuff off of the 
none	 cart but i have our giant lead safe in here  sam oh yeah  ashley how heavy is it  laura its pretty heavy  matt as you guys are having this conversation the regiment is coming up over a nearer hill and  its about half a mile off from you now as its marching you can hear the distant rustling of  hundreds and hundreds of footfalls making their way through the field  travis in our direction  matt it looks like theyre going to be probably passing in front of you  sam should we 
none	 hide  marisha i rolled a 15  matt you rolled a 15 there is no natural paths here its an open field there are areas where  the grass isnt quite as dense and there are some spots where some of the dirt isnt as receptive to  grass you find patches of dry ground but there are no paths that you notice leading out of this  space unfortunately  taliesin you dont know any mending magic do you  laura gasps i have mending i have a mending cantrip  matt you do whats the space on 
none	 mending  taliesin youre welcome im sitting here thinking if only we had a mending cantrip of some kind  laura i have that  liam i have for two minutes been thinking if only i had the mending spell  laura you guys i can mend things thanks for reminding me on that molly  taliesin i just had to say it out loud  sam can you try it on the wheel  liam pigeon coo  laura yeah i can try it  sam lets just do it lets see what happens  matt as you focus 
none	 on the front wheel the one that had just dented inward and the wood  splintered a bit that was barely keeping it up the wheel rights itself the metal bends back into  place the wood splinters kick right in the spokes are as if they were untouched  laura guys im amazing  sam yes you are  laura that would have been way more amazing if id remembered that i could do this let me try it  on this other wheel though  sam wait we have two broken wheels  matt yeah one was partially 
none	 damaged the other one was pretty wrecked the other wheel  unfortunately has taken a fair amount of damage from the impact and the lower half of it has  broken inward its splintered out and its bent its way off of the axle unfortunately its a bit  too big for the mending cantrip to fix  ashley can i try to punch it into place  matt its pretty wrecked you do have three wheels which means you could try it  ashley one of us could be a wheel  matt yasha curls up around the axle 
none	  marisha how far away is the army  matt you probably have about ten minutes before they cross over the byway  marisha okay im going to come over and be like i think we should hide and wait until these guys  pass with this being the situation  liam how tall is the grass around here  matt beauregard caleb molly and jester you guys notice breaking away from the regiment above  you see a cluster of horses heading in your direction you are out in the open  marisha are we going to get questioned 
town	  sam we could pull the cart off the road if yasha picks it up and runs along with it  ashley i could try we could also kill those people and take their horses  laura no i think the army would see it  travis ill use disguise self and ill turn myself into a crownsguard  matt okay  marisha nott you should hide  laura we should look like were people that are peasants or something  marisha i agree whats our story  travis im escorting you to the labenda swamp right to retrieve stuff 
none	 for the crown for  zadash  laura no we needed help because our family is in the swamp  ashley we could say we were helping out what was her name  marisha were just traveling hired hands we are going to go to the swamp and look for yard work  travis you should move the safe  sam in the swamp  laura i push the safe off the cart  travis yeah yasha and jester should take the safe  matt horse galloping  sam are there any woods or anywhere to hide  matt its 
town	 high grass the grass off the road where you guys are standing right now is for you  almost shoulderhigh  sam im going to go in the grass  matt stealth check  taliesin im just going to sit on the wagon looking bored  laura i just bought it its in the bag  sam 22 am i still drunk do i need to  matt no youve been traveling for half a day since you left so youve pretty much sobered up  marisha maybe they can help us fix our wheel  taliesin thats my thought 
town	  laura the good stuffs in my bag dont worry  matt five horses have now galloped up and slow to a trot as they come up alongside loosely circling  the side of your cart in the direction of where the legion is they approach they are all dressed  in righteous brand full armor helmets on blades or bows slung across the shoulders one of them  approaches hail  laura taliesin and ashley hail  marisha good day  matt apologies were going to be crossing the road here shortly we may require your patience  and 
none	 shifting  taliesin we have a broken wheel anyway were not moving at a particular speed at the moment  laura could you help us  matt of course just of curiosity where are you headed  laura we are headed to this swamp place  taliesin we are headed north  travis labenda  marisha the labenda swamp  matt labenda i wouldnt wish it upon my worst foe well good luck i am captain maximilian from  druvenlode  taliesin captain  laura what does he look like  matt through the helmet you see a welltrimmed bit 
none	 of chin facial hair short comes from under  the lip no mustache but you cant see if it continues to the rest of his face  liam wheres he from again  sam and matt druvenlode  liam druvenlode  laura load or loat  matt druvenlode  laura max load got it  taliesin goddamn it  liam where are you all headed  matt im going to do a little hashmark every time  liam just carve it on the back of your dms screen like a prisoner  matt at the end of the campaign you 
none	 look at my side of the wyrmwood table and its all these  horrible marks carved into the wood  travis like zsasz from the batman comics  liam captain where are you headed en masse like this today  matt well it seems that the forces of the empire are heading east to keep the rest of you  safe let me see what we can do  taliesin and laura thank you so much  matt he turns the horse around and begins to head on back three follow him while two stay in the  area not 
town	 close to you but holding down the fort keeping an eye on the road and look behind  sam do either of them have saddlebags  matt they both do  sam can i do a little mage handy a little fishing in the one thats closest to me  matt you very well may make a sleight of hand check  liam do any of us see this  taliesin this cant possibly end poorly  sam 24  matt none of you see this especially not him or his horse  marisha you included the horse  matt 
none	 horses notice things  travis fuck you horse  matt the saddlebag flips open gingerly then reaches in and a small pouch relatively heavy  slips out and makes its way over to you and into your grasp  sam i hold on to it can i peek inside  matt you do it is filled with dry oats and corn  sam its a good one  travis bunch of little things can we ask you are you familiar with the labenda swamp  matt the captain has ridden off so one of the two other people that are 
none	 there you now look  within the armor one is male and one is female and the female soldier turns to you she has a  tense stare and a broadshouldered look as she turns in your direction ive never been but i  hear its pretty shitty  travis seems the same as what he just said were not quite sure what to expect any tales or  stories you can share  matt from what ive heard at the very least its not very comfortable but people seem to  like it and live there still its one 
none	 of the older provinces in the empire that i know not  for me  liam would you rather be headed there or where youre heading  matt thats not really a question unfortunately in times of war we go where were  needed were needed to the east so that you dont have to go and wade into the battlefield  yourselves  laura how long have you been a soldier  matt this will be my eighth circle  marisha have you seen the frontline before  matt ive not im both terrified and eager you know you 
none	 daydream of glory and then who knows  once you get there but i get the sense that youve seen your fair share of battle in your day  right looks right towards yasha this hulking woman with a giant twohanded greatsword on her back  travis highpitched pigeon voice stop smiling anything else but that  matt at this point another series of clomping catches up to you and you can see the captains  returned with two men who are in similar colors as the righteous brand regiment but not in armor  they carry large packs on 
town	 their side and you can hear the jangling of metal implements inside one  of them has pieces of wood some strips they get off the horse and at this the captain goes right  theres the cart do your business were going to do our best to help you get back to the road friends  marisha and travis thanks captain  laura thank you so much for your help  matt of course the two gentlemen go over and start giving each other commands lift up  there one of them pulls it up  laura do you 
none	 need any help  matt by all means if you have the right then jesters now holding the whole cart up by  herself they get down pull the wheel off and begin to bend it back into place one of them goes  through a small pack of various pieces of wood some that appear to have been soaked and are somewhat  pliable ends up replacing the broken wood nailing it in place just to be safe they take  some rope and tie it over the wheel very taut to try and hold the bent wood this 
town	 should get you at  least to town i cant guarantee it will last you for a long journey but i recommend a replacement  once you get there  laura thank you so much  matt of course come on they get back on their horses and they ride back at this point the  regiment has now crossed over the road and you can now see hundreds of soldiers going across the  byway the captain gives a nod puts his helmet back on well i wish you all luck stay safe and  i hope that if 
none	 luck is kind to us well cross paths again  liam stay safe as well thank you  laura stay safe  sam bye  laura everybody be safe  matt they turn around and they make their way back up to the rest of the army about 25 minutes  or so it takes for the group of soldiers to finally cross over the path  laura actually it was faster than i expected  matt yeah it wasnt a huge army per se not as big as the one you saw leaving zadash in total  it might 
town	 have been maybe 1000 soldiers  taliesin the kiss army basically  matt now that the way is opened your cart seems to have been temporarily repaired you make your way your way  back onto the road and continue your heading north  laura could i try mending again and see if what they did made it to where i can fix it now  matt sure ill say for the purposes of this make a wisdom check  laura oh no im wise  taliesin thats the most insane roll ive ever seen  laura 23 wait thats 
none	 a lie that was a save 20  matt there you go because you were so close you were able to see all of the points in which they  attempted to repair the wheel and now that theyve closed the gap on what is currently cracked and on  the verge of collapsing if this fix wasnt centered around it you manage to concentrate and  with that each one of the  laura traveler be with us  matt you watch as the wood refixes itself and becomes a solid wheel  laura tada  travis thats very 
none	 handy jester  laura thank you  ashley very cool  liam good trick  marisha its fitting that the traveler helps fix a wheel  sam amazing  laura right  marisha its very poetic  laura yes  marisha i like it  laura you see that caleb thats almost as powerful as the shit that you do  sam lets not get crazy what he can do is incredible have you seen him in action  laura have you seen my lollipop  marisha she did just lift up the carriage  sam oh yes shes super 
town	 strong yeah just her magic theres no  laura dont make me inflict wounds on you nott  taliesin theres nothing thats being said here that cant be said at full momentum  sam oh no are going to ring a bell in my head  matt with that the cart lurches forward you all have to catch up real fast to scamper back onto  the cart as molly has picked it up again you get yourself back on the road and heading northward  laura yeah  matt keeping watch for the rest of the way eventually the 
none	 sun comes close to setting and you  havent quite gotten within visual range of the swamp youre coming to a relatively hilly portion of  the terrain and ahead most of the valley tends to cruise upward where the hills are now cresting and  obscuring the horizon but the sun is setting so you may be looking somewhere to camp unless you  want to push through the night  liam i think we should camp because then we will hit this swamp at a more advantageous  moment  travis lets see if we can find a 
none	 rise on one of these hills to camp on the top  marisha hey fjord have you had any more weird dreams  travis no very peaceful actually  marisha are your dreams affected by the weather like if its cold do you throw up ice shards  instead of salt water or something  travis no  marisha because that can be cool  travis yeah i could see how that would appear that way  laura and kind of painful probably  travis more that it hasnt happened that frequently  marisha okay  travis yeah but not 
none	 yet if it does ill let you know  liam how frequent is it  travis its only happened a couple of times honestly  liam a couple of times you have spit out seawater  travis well yeah just the once actually  marisha we dont know if its seawater though right it could be like saline  liam saline solution  sam do you wear contacts  liam hey youre not supposed to drink that stuff its for rinsing  travis i dont abide by the rules i walk my own path like a twister i was born 
none	 to walk alone  marisha maybe thats your problem this whole time  travis fuck the rules give me saline or give me death  matt smash cut to fjords grave  laura well shit  taliesin we gave him saline  liam this weeks episode brought to you by bausch  lomb  matt as you continue up towards this particular hillcrest there is a small patch of high bushes  in an older campsite there is a clearing of the grass where its mostly rock and dirt with some  bits of dried brush theres a rock formation 
none	 with a bit of charcoal and blackened ground where  a fireplace had previously been set  taliesin this will do just perfectly lets do this  travis lets set it up  matt you guys bring the cart off to the side set up your evening arrangement light a small fire  there in that same rock circle whos taking first watch  liam silver thread around the fire  travis ill take first  taliesin ill join  matt one of you make the watch roll with advantage as the other is giving aid  taliesin natural 20 
dung	  matt nice in the vicinity as the dark night takes over there is no moonlight it is very  dark but you do catch a flash in the distance rumbling and another  taliesin oneone thousand twoone thousand  threeone thousand is it getting closer  matt you listen for a while and it is getting closer  marisha are we exposed like out  matt you guys are out in the open yeah  travis were at the top of a rise so we can see really well  taliesin were going to get rained on  marisha 
town	 can we all huddle under the  laura youre not awake  marisha i mean snoring  travis i dont mind rain  taliesin do we have anything we dont have actual tents do we we dont have proper tents  matt not unless any of you have it within your pack but otherwise all you have is your cart  laura this is why we should have taken that circus tent man  travis i have an idea lets carve the bellies out of the horses and we climb inside  sam so that we dont get wet  
none	 travis yeah  marisha full tauntaun style  laura are there any caves nearby i mean were kind of by a thing  matt youre in the middle of a field right now its hilly terrain and the topography shifts a  bit but right now all you see is darkness beyond your immediate darkvision peripheral  travis were going to get wet  liam how many of us can fit under that cart i wonder  travis even then the grounds going to get  liam disgusting  marisha soaking  matt the occasional flash of light you see 
none	 in the distance begins to frame an ominous shape far to  the north the beginnings of a mountain range that you have been able to see previously or hadnt  paid attention with the darkening sky  laura did you guys wake us up because of the storm im assuming  travis i think the storms going to wake you up soon enough  matt and it does those who are taking the first part of your evenings rest come to as the storm  begins to come over the weather gets colder you feel the rain imminent within 
none	 the next hour  marisha i was curious of that too  laura what is he looking for  sam the map  laura oh its right there  sam singing get out the map  marisha how close are we to the xhorhasian border  laura were pretty far away  liam were going here  travis these are not explosions orange or red  matt no these were lightning bolts in the distance in the storm  marisha oh theres druvenlode theres max load  liam silberquel ridge perhaps hupperdook is beyond that mountain range  laura does 
none	 that mean that guy was named after a whole city does that means he owns a city  matt travis and liam he was from druvenlode  laura oh i thought that was his last name  sam his name was captain maximilian  marisha i mean if he was taking the leonardo da vinci approach then it could be accurate max of lode  travis hmm i think we just need to hunker down  laura ill take the next watch because i dont mind the rain  matt the rain begins to kick in your vicinity  ashley 
none	 ill take next watch too  matt the fire begins to go out  taliesin im getting underneath the cart  sam me too  marisha im going to get on the cart and try and put my cloak over me  matt okay the cloak you have is treated with simple wax to try and resist most water youll  probably be a bit soggy in the morning but its doable  travis im staying up i like the rain  marisha i look at molly underneath me on the cart and i fart a little bit just a 
none	 little  sam im down here too  farting noise  travis not a little one dont gamble on those  matt alcohol and beef jerky man  taliesin at least ill definitely notice the smell like fucking roses  marisha sorry  matt the first watch goes beyond the rain without incident who is taking the second watch  liam it is a big group of us yeah is there enough people left over to do the last watch  ashley ill take last  matt well theres only been the first watch  travis which was molly and 
dung	 i next one is caleb and jester  matt okay i didnt hear that part so caleb and jester whos keeping up whos the point man  on that watch  liam oh your eyesight is better than mine  matt make your check  laura just regular plain old check  matt at this point its midnight so its pitch black  laura thats not bad 19  matt you keep watch throughout the area now without the warm glow of the fire to give you a  good visual perspective all you can go by are the distant 
none	 flashes and sometimes close flashes of  lightning thunder a loud one hits probably striking a tree no more than two or three miles  from where you are all of you get jostled awake for a moment before getting yourself back to sleep  laura big one did you see that  matt if i could have everybody leave the table except for yasha please  sam what  liam the storm  laura shit storm  marisha oh shit  yelling  matt as much as everyone else is attempting and jostling around to get rest through the 
dung	 nights  weather theres something comforting about the sound of rolling thunder to you always kind of  has been but more so in recent years as unconsciousness comes to you what usually means  dreamless sleep welcome to be dreamless because not all dreams are good for you not all memories  are good for you but as the dark takes you theres a flash of light the sound of thunder  and theres a vision a memory of people all around you but faced away people you know  people you grew up with all looking the opposite 
dung	 direction it fades to dark theres another flash  and youve pushed through them and you see an elevated piece of ground in the central rock in  the shape of a figure but you cant see it its obscured by the low light you do know who that  shape is it goes to dark it stays dark for a while to the point where you are longing for that  next vision clamoring for it you feel this searing pain burning up each of your arms you  look down but can see nothing except for flames curling 
none	 up the side dull bluish purple flames  that create the outline of your forearms it burns up to the tips of your fingers flash once more  and around you are bodies creatures people children monsters dozens and dozens of corpses  carved and torn asunder where you saw the blue flame up your arm you just see blood dripping  fresh crimson onto the ground the only sound you hear your vision fades to darkness once more  thunder another blast and there you see it the ruined statue the one beacon of nameless hope  that pulled 
none	 you out of that darkness missing part of its torso the head mostly cleaved akilter  the land seemingly ejecting the presence of what this statue represents your eyes look down and  focus at the base and as the vision begins to fade to black once more your eyes focus on that single  disc the four bolts of lightning the darkness takes you once more the next flash thunder  hits and youre just walking your lips are parched your muscles ache you look over your  shoulder and you see before you the memory of the land 
none	 where you grew up the waste beyond the  central swamp of xhorhas but it is crawling with thousands and thousands of worms from this  perspective it looks like its so small but for these worms to be where they are they would be so  immense at this distance the perspective is almost dizzying and you look away you glance up  back at that mountain and in spite of that pain you continue to push the vision fades and this  time the darkness lingers confusion wells in the desperation for something its not fair its  
dung	 not fair to be given just a few glimpses and no opportunity no chance how do you make this  right what do you make right what did you do what is there thunder one final loud  shattering shaking flash of light and rolling thunder brings to you one singular vision of a  figure in the dark center of a storm cloud swirling the wind buffets your shoulders with  freezing air you feel your hair being whipped and thrown around your face stinging as it slaps  against your cheeks and eyes the same figure that statue 
none	 that had pulled you from the darkness  once before stands made of the same roaring and roiling clouds and rain and wind stepping out of  the sky towards you you can see the musclebound form the gray flesh formless yet solid as it  steps down like a titan from the sky the foot lands but a quartermile from where you stand  but the impact causes the ground beneath you to quake thunder you strangely feel comfort you  cant look away from this figure as the hand comes down and gently rests on the ground before 
none	  you before it turns upward to a palm a sourceless voice comes into your head a voice  youve never heard for all that youve chased this mystery what this beacon is this is the first  time youve heard a voice through this imagery all it says is you walk the right path be  strong dont forget who you were and decide who you will become the vision fades back into  darkness thunder another blast of thunder and this time you wake up suddenly the rain is still  pouring outside youre amongst the grass can 
none	 we get everybody else back in please  ashley okay okay okay holy moly  matt you wake up youre shivering a bit from the cold and the night air the ground has dampened  even beneath the cart you were sleeping beneath the cart right  ashley near it  travis did she go back to new york  ashley im here  travis okay good  marisha that would be fucked up if you used that as your exit wait where what do you mean  ashley left  matt you forgot to say goodbye shes just gone 
none	  liam singing never say goodbye  sam so was she a xhorhasian spy and are we all dead in our sleep  matt roll a perception check no  travis is it water or blood that were covered in  matt as you come to consciousness through this evenings rest for your final watch as you gather  after that sleep is probably not going to find its way to you again for the rest of the evening who  is taking the final watch with you  liam oh man jester and i talked about everything like everything 
town	 about childhood  favorite kind of ice cream we know everything about each other now  taliesin pistachio or rocky road  liam im going to mull it over in my sleep good night  travis third watch is going to be either yasha and nott or yasha and beau  sam ill take it  matt one of you two make the watch perception roll  sam you can do it  matt just make a single roll  ashley okay eight  matt as you all rest for the final length of the evening yasha and nott you 
none	 stay up chatting as  much as you like or staying quiet as much as you like the rain still pouring through in sheets  heavily  sam how you holding up can i go under you can you be like a shelter for me like a leanto  ashley sure if you want to get under my hood here  sam wing  ashley well it doesnt come out all the time  sam i dont know how it works  ashley its just if i get really mad  sam but your arm is probably big enough to 
none	 shield me from the rain thank you  ashley are you dry  sam thank you yes i dont like to get wet  ashley i feel like i dont know if i want to keep doing this  sam thats okay  ashley okay could you give me a moment  sam give you a moment  ashley im going to go to the tree over there  sam do you have to take a piss  ashley yes  sam all right i wont look  ashley okay  sam i look  ashley i go where near 
none	 the tree was struck close to us  matt its about a quartermile walk from where you are but you can head there  laura thats not that long of a walk quarter mile  matt yeah you can get there a little jaunt down there soaking wet as the rain still pours down  you approach and you come to the halfsplintered form of one of the larger trees in this section  there are a few dotted singular trees or clusters around but this was once a tall and proud tree  as you approach you can see 
none	 near the top its been carved right down the center and part of it has  splintered and exploded there are chunks of wood around the vicinity and you can see even  amongst the rain on the interior of the exposed trunk there are still faintly orange glowing  embers from where the bolt had struck through the night  sam whispered and a baseball bat  marisha whispered lemonade  ashley i heard you and i wanted to thank you for saving me and i promise you i will be the  best servant you ever had thank 
none	 you im going to take a piece of the bark and id like to carve the  symbol into the tree the stormlord symbol not very good but just to have it there  matt the bark is a harder utensil to utilize to carve into bark  ashley sorry i take a piece of the bark to have and i use my sword  matt you can take it and carve in the edge there using the tip it takes you a few minutes to do  so but you manage to complete the shell of the symbols outline 
none	 and then make your trek back to  join up with nott  ashley i got a piece of this bark from that powerful lightning that struck it  sam you got bark from a lightningstruck tree  ashley yeah i wanted to put it in my things i like to have things from nature  sam do you collect things i collect things  ashley yeah i do  sam what kind of collections do you have  ashley i pull out my book i mostly put flowers and things in here because im collecting them for  someone 
none	 and i want to keep them all in here from my travels  sam oh its beautiful is it a special someone  ashley yes  sam someone back home thats so nice  ashley yeah but what are the things you collect  sam i collect all sorts of things i have a button collection i used to collect stamps i  used to collect different kinds of vials of different sorts of fluids and things like that i  collect soles of shoes not shoes just the soles  ashley oh just the bottom bits  sam yeah 
none	 they come in many different shapes and sizes the cobblers throw them away when theyre  bad you can fish them out of the trash and you can have a whole bunch of them  ashley what do you use them for  sam nothing i mean you can play a little drum thing with them  ashley and should you need to resole your shoes  sam sure if you string them together they make a roman gladiator belt sort of a thing  ashley have you ever put them one on top of the other and make a 
none	 platform shoe  sam ooh i could be a little bit taller i think if you put two on top of each other and push them  in it looks like lips are talking  ashley cool well  sam i feel like weve gotten to know each other so well  ashley very much so do you want to get back under here  sam yes under your gigantic arm thank you  matt as nott cuddles up alongside yashas comparably hulking form to keep out of the water  you finish your final watch as you both watch 
dung	 the sun begin to rise over the horizon or at least  you cant see the sun but you can see the day grows lighter as it makes its way over the cloud  cover the rain is not quite as strong and the lightning seems to have subsided but it is still  a light drizzle when it comes to the proper morning as the rest of you come to consciousness  completing your long rest the day is yours damp as it may be the low fog and mist still  encompasses most of the valley around you 
none	 and its a beautiful sight as you glance around first  thing in the morning you can see only the tops of the hills slowly breaking through the layer of  cold mist that hits the lower valleys between that shifting topography as you look off you can now  have a much better view of the silberquel ridge above this large mountain range that marks the  geological center of the empire as you glance down you can barely make out what might be the swamp  liam whats the temperature like right now  matt its pretty cold 
town	 id say its probably in the high 40s  liam we have to be miserable right now because we are soaking wet and it is cold  taliesin this is not my first time  laura ah its like a day at the beach  matt its not freezing point yet but its definitely cold and wet  taliesin yeah i miss having a proper tent and the wagons were nice i miss that  laura we should get some waxed canvas or something  taliesin something at least  travis howd the rest of the night go any lightning 
none	 strikes or anything crazy  laura there was a big one close by  travis there was  laura it happened right before i went to sleep  travis did you see it  matt where molly pointed over there you see what was once a tree is destroyed and splintered  travis thats so rare  ashley it tipped it right over  travis thats ama i mean right lightning strike  laura dont know  sam happens every time it rains  travis im going to run over and look at the tree  matt its impressive  
none	 travis yeah can i take some little twigs and pieces of wood and put it in my little component  pouch  taliesin theyre good luck  travis thats what ive heard  taliesin yeah tree struck by lightning very good luck  laura really  travis ive only seen it hitting the water and its just explosion  marisha i heard it was bad luck thats what i was told  taliesin its bad luck for normal people  marisha fuck  laura so what kind of people  taliesin everybody else  laura so i should go  
none	 taliesin absolutely  laura im going to go get some of it too  travis yeah  sam lets take the whole fucking tree  taliesin dig it up  laughter  marisha attach it to the back of the horse go  travis destroy the cart  marisha yeah  travis fuck  taliesin i go over to take a look at it  liam i am working on a thing i have not got it figured out yet but i think that i could make  some sort of shelter for us so that this doesnt have to 
none	 happen again i havent worked out all  the what  sam a magical shelter  taliesin or just out of waxed cloth  marisha yeah how do you mean  liam no magic of course but i dont have the ive been working on it but i havent struck to the  sam you need more paper  marisha you need more incense  liam well i always need those things but i need more time and more research  taliesin well if you come up with an ingredients list well be happy to drum stuff up  liam 
none	 thank you mollymauk  taliesin talking about making shelter that sounds great  travis yeah  marisha what kind of a shelter  liam this sucks  travis and taliesin yeah it does  marisha like a dome like a bubble dome how do you mean  liam i have higher hopes of i mean this is a long ways off but i would love a large home or a  mansion of some kind that you can snaps on a whim doesnt that sound amazing  laura thats impossible you cant make something like that  sam caleb can 
none	 do it if he sets his mind to it  taliesin like some sort of phantom manor is what youre speaking of it would appear  ashley that sounds like that wouldnt be something thats real  travis yeah ive never heard of anything like that  ashley me neither  taliesin doesnt have to be real to be interesting  liam we have all of us seen magic in our lives  taliesin i like this plan im into it  liam nothing is impossible  ashley but i see from her you know she fixed a wheel  
none	 laura i fixed a wheel  liam that is correct  ashley naturally she could make a house next  laura i could do it because i can make a giant lollipop  liam you have faith so you should have faith  laura i have lots of faith  travis if you can caleb that would be quite remarkable  laura is it considered faith if you just really like somebody  travis and taliesin no  laura oh  travis well listen nothing gets the blood warmed like movement so perhaps we should pick up and  get 
none	 going  taliesin im going to before we take off take a look at that tree that got hit i want to examine  how it was struck by lightning  matt make an investigation check  marisha beau does pushups while waiting for molly  matt actually this would be more of a nature check  taliesin all right nature three  matt its struck by lightning man pretty impressive  taliesin is this practically like a little bowl now or did it split  matt it split and a lot of the tree is still standing but its 
town	 broken open from the center  and one half of its broken away and shot off into multiple pieces  taliesin im going to drop a piece of silver in the center so the next person who comes around and  examines this thing finds a piece of silver  matt okay cool  liam also caleb has watched beauregard go to town on 100 pushups or something and i go maybe  40 feet away and i try as well i do one pushup and then i go study siff duthars spell tome some  more instead of going 
none	 to two  matt fair enough  sam are we waiting here for a while  laura no  matt no you guys are moving on  sam oh were on a moving cart  matt you are now  laura i want to ride on a horse today  matt jester jumps onto one of the horses backs as you guys begin to pick up speed and head down  youre now at the very top of this major series of hill clusters and making your way down towards the  base of the silberquel ridge  sam as 
none	 we travel im going to try to make acid probably not a great idea but im going to  matt do you have alchemy supplies on you  sam yeah i bought a kit ive been trying to do it for a while but weve never stopped  matt all right i would like you to make hold on its roll plus proficiency because youre  proficient in alchemy plus this will have to be dexterity at disadvantage because youre in the  back of a moving cart  travis wooden wheel cart  sam 16 plus proficiency is 19 
none	  matt correct  sam but now i roll at disadvantage  liam roll a 20  sam nine thats a 12  matt you manage to succeed in spite of the at one point it gets a little dodgy and you almost  drop it and catch it before it begins to spill the nearly completed acidic formula all over the  center of the wooden cart eating through it  travis youre making cocktails  sam yeah  matt you manage to complete one vial of acid so you can mark that down  sam one vial of 
none	 acid great  matt as you guys approach the mountain range you can see the clouds now that have pressed down  obscure the peaks of the top of the range you can see the darkened mountainous form vanishing up  into the top gray whereas in the distance sheets of rain that are still coming down much  heavier to the north obscure your ability to see further beyond the northward valley to either side  of the range you also see the southern base of the mountains which is the direction youre  heading you get the sense 
none	 that the watershed that most of the mountain range seems to almost  lean to a southward direction so the watershed of all the rain pours and slides down the mountain to  this one central southern area and there you see the darkened tangled thick swamp of labenda  your destination  laura ugh its going to suck even more because of this storm  matt sitting deep green and distant tangled and sprawling before you  liam how far up is it about  matt from where you are now id say its eight or so miles  
dung	 liam okay  laura hey at least its cold so there wont be a lot of bugs around normally bugs are terrible in  swamps i hear  taliesin id rather be cold than have bugs  laura right  taliesin yeah its a very fair point  matt continuing your path on for a little bit of the morning eventually you begin to watch as the  grasses begin to give way to more moistened thats a fun word to use moistened terrain the  normal dry even after a rain the damp ground is now becoming sludgy and 
town	 the path itself the  road seems to have been wellbuilt and set for this type of travel but even then its starting  to gather on the wheels a bit as you ride through and you can see bits of it are clustering up and  leaving this groove in the ground behind you  taliesin whos on a horse am i on the cart or am i on a horse  ashley im on a horse  taliesin ill be in the cart then  marisha ill be in the cart  liam cart  taliesin im going 
dung	 to take one of the swords and start using the flat of the blade to scrape the  wheel and give it an edge to start removing the mud off of it and hop between wheels  matt okay and you move around each one it doesnt get too bad thankfully because its  still pretty slick when it clumps on it generally slides off its not immediately damp  from the first time for most of the vicinity here  laura oh no and if you start to lose hope your horse sinks into the mud and its gone 
none	 forever  travis that fucking movie traumatized me  matt the rain does eventually begin to subside however the edge of the swamp begins to breach  the path that youre heading you begin to see the swamp grasses take over from the hillside you  begin to see the heavy puddles of swamp bog water beginning to appear to the right and left the  trees youre used to seeing here in the middle of the field are giving way to banyan trees and other  thickertrunked gnarled bases heavy thick vinecovered canopies the insects begin to fill  
none	 the air with a weird buzzing  laura oh i thought there wouldnt be insects because its cold  liam in addition to the insects do we start to become aware of wildlife around birds and  beasts  matt make a perception check  sam do we know anything about where were going  travis were going to see a safe house that the lights have been out at  laura were trying to find febron keyes  sam yeah but its a big swamp are any of us good at like wood stuff is this me am i 
town	 the girl  liam im good at nature ive lived in the woods for a long time  marisha im okay at surviving  matt about half an hour or so of travel along the road into the center of labenda swamp the humid  air prevents the mounting sweat on your body from evaporating causing your sweat to pool in your  armor in uncomfortable ways your breathing is somewhat shallow as you adapt to the moisture in  the air around you the everpresent hum of the buzzing insects begins to permeate the atmosphere  around you while 
none	 the musky stench of decaying plants and stagnant water grow stronger the  further in you pass a very low fog since its still relatively early in the day sits across the  surface of the water thats exposed in patches between where the thick roots and soft rotting  vegetation seems to be sitting like a spongy ground  marisha im going to take my staff and poke it in the marshy bits  matt as you push down it sinks a few inches as you pull back the portion that you had pressed in  remains but the 
none	 water begins to fill up the space where your staff had pushed in  liam on the plus side i think sitting in the cart that caleb is probably the cleanest he has  been in two years because its been raining non stop  matt you guys continue further into the swamp you get about another half hour or so on the path  before beauregard caleb molly and jester all at once you hear this strange trilled cry of some  kind its like cawing  liam i cast mage armor on myself  matt mage armor  
none	 laura that sounds like it was talking or did that sound like a bird  taliesin i think that sounded like a bird talking  marisha it sounded like an alert to me  ashley i dont think i heard anything  laura should we call back  taliesin what should we call back  marisha cawing  travis okay thats what we decided to do  liam thats not a good idea  travis nope  marisha maybe its a mating call  laura maybe its just a bird  taliesin i dont see how thats any better  
town	 matt you hear it again only this time it sounds intense or frantic the strange bird croaking  marisha does it sound like multiple or from the same source  matt it sounds singular so far  laura wheres it coming from what area  matt its coming to the right off the road like deep into the swamp  laura its over there  sam are we going to stop were moving  matt you guys are still moving forward on the path  laura can we look can we see can we see into the swamp  matt 
town	 make a perception check  laura natural one  matt as youre glancing out there a piece of stray vegetation falling from one of the nearby  trees flitters into your eye  laura ow i got a leaf no i think its a leaf  sam use mending  laura i use mending on my eye  matt no effect  travis now that weve continued on how do the wagon wheels look on the road as were moving are  they leaving tracks thats filling in with water behind us at this point  matt faintly  travis 
town	 not like the staff push though  matt no she was pushing off the path this road is designed to not sink heavy with the rest of  the swamp material a lot of travel happens in and out on this main path on the byway as long as  youre on the path for the most part you should be fine  marisha is this considered the berleben path  matt this is the path to berleben the bromkiln byway is the road youre taking  marisha the bromkiln so this is not  matt youre in the swamp 
town	  sam the road goes through the swamp  matt yes and berleben is further in the swamp  liam i would say that caleb has spent a lot of time over the last several years in woods can i  check to see if i have ever heard that cry before  matt make a nature check  liam that is an 18  matt it sounds similar to a crow cry but it sounds frantic youve heard the sound similar to  it before when you once as a child watched a crow snatched in the jaws of 
town	 some sort of hunting cat  right before its bones were crushed and it went lifeless its a very similar sound  sam thats specific  travis no movement that we can see just the sound  matt no just the sound its loud enough where its not that far off the road but its not in  sight right now theres too many tree trunks obscuring your vision  travis branch canopies over us at this point  matt they are but theyre not super thick theres still light coming through and as you  travel there are bits 
town	 and pieces that overhang the road but you still have open sky ahead of  you you dont think its going to continue the further into the swamp you go  laura fjord will you look at my eye i think theres something still in here  travis yeah here look up yeah you got like a tree booger in it  laura fjord get it  travis oh god this is the worst part can i try and get the boog out of her eye  matt roll a dexterity check  sam please be a one please be 
none	 a one please be a one  travis natural 20  matt with a deft flick of his finger he manages to pluck the piece of vegetation from your eye  laura wow my hero  travis i got it jester  laura thank you oskar i mean fjord  matt it gently hits the side of mollys cheek  liam fjord regurgitates saline solution  travis i got it vomiting  laura yasha starts throwing up  ashley uhoh its happening again  marisha does there appear to be any sign of wreckage or anything else that looks like 
none	 it  might not have made its way through this path because of other dangers  matt you who have been keeping a discerning eye and you rolled what on your perception check before  marisha 15 but that was a bit ago  matt roll again as youve stopped at this place here  marisha thats not as good this time 12  matt 12 something shifts in the water ahead almost beyond your vision something that was  stationary before and looked like a log that had been resting in the water dips away from you in  
none	 the direction of the noise  marisha nobody move  taliesin im going to gently light up one of my swords  matt okay go ahead and mark that  marisha if youre going to move move onto the cart  sam have we stopped the cart  laura but were on horses  marisha are we on horses  matt you guys are still on the path yeah  sam should we stop moving the cart  travis what did you see yeah we should stop whatd you see  marisha something just moved in the water it might

dung	 you can see a part of a tree has fallen into it and the liquid is generally darkening the bottom  of where its been stuck you dont know how long its been there there is the dark root and  crooked branches and elements of it sticking up in the air the smell of bog rot is very strong  even from this proximity to it you see something moving in the center of this bog struggling  shifting you see covered in this tarlike material and flailing some sort of humanoid  creature of jet black skin its 
none	 not skin feathers its fighting against the swamp its  small shifting out of the water off to the side slowly up to the bog probably what beau saw  earlier some sort of reptilian creature with a long snout and a long tail curving around and  making its way slowly towards the bog as the flailing bird creature is attempting to give a  panicked bird croaking  laura i cast guiding bolt on the reptilian creature  sam how far is it  laura its 120 feet distance and you said that the bog is 100 feet

none	 an investigation check  liam yeah that is a 25  matt looking through it and making out the layout of it it was definitely a post house for berleben  when it was first made the stones look well over 100 years old they have long been reclaimed by  the roots and vines of the swamp nothing special beyond that really just an abandoned post  liam just looks like a bunch of old crap to be honest  taliesin thats disappointing i kick it  marisha let me hold this dagger for just a moment  matt

none	  matt there is no spoken language  laura should we tell her  sam we dont know that this feathers are her parents  matt looking through with your medicine check it looks like theres only three between the two of them  laura theres three bodies were they big bones or little bones  matt they look to be little  marisha her sisters parents are alive  laura then theyre really sad and they will be happy that one of their children  travis what good will it do i dont think that we need to tell 
none	 her  laura yeah no we wont tell her that i was afraid that it was her parents but if we can let  her parents know that shes okay then at least  sam you said that you could send a message  laura yeah well the travelers been teaching me some stuff and i was asking him the other night  about how i could thank my mama and stuff like that he taught me a little bit of how to send  messages across distances  sam wow but dont you need to know who youre telling

none	 how people react to nott around here what if we drag her in  front of some crazy locals  taliesin all of this are great points but im waiting for another idea  liam well i think we should do what we have done well so far which is to improvise it is better  to bring her with her and then leave her and then if we find an advantageous place to leave her  then we will but for the time being she is a sidekick  matt like caleb sidekick  travis fair chance is better 
none	 than none  taliesin its also possibly someone to watch the cart while we do our businesses  laura plus in the morning i can send a message to your mom and dad  matt like jester mom and dad  laura right we can gift you a horse and then you can go find them  matt chirping  travis we should get back to the cart and at least try to make our way into some drier  taliesin to see if we can find somewhere safe  laura ill carry this leather to the cart  matt

dung	 tangle of trees and vines to see  the distant glow of lanterns just as the sun sets and the evening sky grows dark closer still you  make out a strange mismatch of varying levels that make up the village whole areas stand on stilts  and raised platforms connected by bridges while much of the city to the eastern side appears to be  partly submerged in bog water the browns greens and grays of the marsh itself is reflected in the  browns greens and grays of the people who now wander the streets going about their 
town	 business  welcome to berleben a somewhat miserablelooking but functional village here in the dwendalian  empire as you come off the road the road gives way into this central district which looks to be  a smattering of stone slabs cobblestone and whatever pieces of material were left over from  construction that helped fix and maintain a main road here in the central opening before it  scatters into the rest of the city what would you like to do  taliesin technically did we get a short rest on the way in or did that not happen 
tavern	  liam jester took most of the day to harvest a gator  matt yeah  laura we should probably look for an inn or something right  marisha we have to look for febron who is apparently in the keystone pub  laura we should look for the keystone pub  liam febron keyes in the keystone pub  marisha in the mumbling district i ran out of page  liam in the puddles  marisha in the puddles it is in the puddles i got pudd  liam puddin  matt in the puddin  laura is there 
none	 anybody outside right now  matt there are people walking through the streets some of them are carrying small sacks  over their shoulder from one place to another or in the process of wandering over to make about  their business for the city and they notice you approach and theyre slightly nosey paying  attention to these strangers that came in off the byway  sam im going to cast disguise self on myself  matt okay to look like  sam a little halfling girl  matt all righty confused chirping  sam its still me i

none	 your bag fine  travis from what we can see in the streets is anyone carrying any weapons or guards or spears  matt there are you do actually see a handful of crownsguard theyre present its still part of  the empire though they look to be somewhat lackluster at least their armor isnt as shiny  and wellkept it looks like one of them is like ah fucking hell theyre stationed here and  theyre probably not very appreciative and have tried their best to adapt to the life here in the  labenda swamp but they are 
town	 visible throughout the town including the puddles which you begin to go  towards almost half of the city takes up the puddles it looks like it was the oldest portion  of the town the original berleben was just this district called the puddles the entirety of it  is beneath between one to three inches of water so as you begin to descend from the central area of the  town you begin to submerge your feet and the entire rest of the city has slowly been sinking  into the swamp its like slowly wading through a 
town	 tide at the beach its also very much the  impoverished side if you could imagine an area of the swamp more impoverished than what youve  already come across this is it you see a lot of huts and hovels all the buildings here on top of  being older masonry and stone structures in construct the bases themselves are a deep algae  green from the floor to about halfway up about two or three feet where moss and fungus and  various other plant matter have slowly grown as the liquid that has been soaking into the 
town	 vicinity  is slowly growing up the sides of these buildings theres a fountain that has completely folded in  now at this point it has fallen into itself bits of the water seem to have permeated through its  an older relic of the earlier construction period  laura i cast mending on the fountain  matt it does nothing  taliesin i love this place this is great  matt crownsguard keep an eye on you as you are the newcomers that walk in you do notice as you  head down to the puddles that one of 
none	 the guards that watched you enter trails back about 30 or so  feet slowly walking and keeping an eye  marisha i pace behind the group and start catching up to him  laura is the wagon doing okay in the  matt yeah its doing all right its only about three inches of water averaged so its not a major  hindrance youre also going at a relatively comfortable pace now that youre in the city  travis keep pushing in looking for any signage of the keystone pub  laura yeah looking for the big tower thing 
none	  matt perception check for both of you guys  liam also very important question how is kiri doing with frumpkin  matt kiri is now enthralled in the back of the cart hood up frumpkin curled up on her lap and  is slowly petting him shes slowly petting him  marisha i match pace with the crownsguard eventually the one thats following us  matt you come up and  marisha i slow behind to match his pace whos following us  matt you two  travis 15  laura 22  matt you see it first and 
none	 as soon as you look in that direction you catch up with that fjord you  spot a small crooked tower maybe about 25 or so feet high it looks like there was originally a  building here that fell into itself and collapsed and they built a pub on top of it not very well  so its a haphazard construct that looks somewhat unstable with bits of broken stone and the only  way you can get up into it are rope ladders hanging down the front of it that lead into an  archway thats open on 
dung	 the top there are two oil lanterns hanging from the outside that give this  faint glow to the exterior from the inside it looks warmly lit though dark  marisha i would hang out here all the time  matt its about an eightfoot climb to get to the threshold of the interior  liam the only way to get in is an eightfoot climb on a rope  matt thats what it looks like yeah  liam oh dear  laura lets go up there  matt you guys guide your way that way you manage to catch 
none	 up with the crownsguard who is walking  as soon as he sees you slowing behind he lets you catch up  laura should somebody stay with the cart maybe because i feel like all of our awesome stuff that  we just got will be taken  sam what stuff  laura this leather that we took  sam bloody crocodile skins  taliesin we have a beautiful piece of leather we also have some fine tapestries we have a safe we  have many things  sam well caleb can put his string around it  liam i

dung	 past the threshold into the archway and are immediately  met with this toughlooking albino dwarf dude hes standing there with pale white skin jet  whitegray hair white eyebrows big white beard with this black leather vest thats tucked into  billowing dark brown pants and boots hes got all these scars and tattoos across his forearms hes  folded and he goes right steps back lets you in  laura hi  matt gives a nod he continues to glare as you guys step inside within its a warmly lit cozy  space that resembles being belowdeck on 
dung	 a ship at sea youre right at home here fjord its all  dark wood from all different angles and its cramped too so it has that similar feel all the  light in here are a handful of oil lanterns so its pretty heavily shaded in certain areas so  youre only catching rim lighting and soft light on certain faces around here theres maybe six  patrons in here total to the right this loud banging sound as two individuals in the process of  building some sort of a stage in the corner immediately to your right 
tavern	 its small maybe  fivefoot by fivefoot but its in the process of being built to your left you see the bar its  an lshaped bar not terribly large there behind it theres three oil lamps set up they light the  area you can see some of the liquor bottles and the ale kegs and everything set up towards the  back of the bar in the front with one patron sitting on a stool you see a rather  cheerfullooking middleaged male gnome as the purveyor of this establishment hes got puffy  black hair and heavy 
tavern	 mutton chops on the sides of his face this bulbous rosy nose hes in the  process of pouring and refilling this tankard for the patron whos leaning against the bar in front  of him this grufflooking fisherman human dude he gives a glance over to you as you step in  taking in the vicinity and goes hey welcome to the keystone pub oldest pub in the labenda the  oldest pub in the labenda is beneath this one but we rebuilt it  laura its really cool  taliesin stunning  matt thank you very much glad
