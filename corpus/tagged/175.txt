none	 the ashari that she is the proper next leader of the zephra air ashari  you traveled far west across the ozmit sea after renting passage across a ship helmed by captain  adela and made your way to the island city of vesrah where you encountered uvenda heart of the  tides the leader of the water ashari and put upon your final trial you were sent into the  subocean aerie of torrent where you were to retrieve lodestones in the constant threat of a  kraken in the vicinity unfortunately the kraken was triggered upon your attempt 
none	 a massive battle  took place one that claimed the life of vaxildan and barely escaped with a success under  your belt you managed to bring his body back to the central temple at the top of vesrah and  through bringing pikes essence by a blessing through sarenrae complete a resurrection ritual  that succeeded vax returns on his everdwindling borrowed time from the raven queen it seems  thrusting himself into danger but returns nonetheless after this you guys got some  pictures drawn by doty as pike intimidated him into learning your names in a wonderful 
none	 method  you got passage on the ship back to emon where you have made your way back to greyskull keep and  that was where we left off as you plan for the next leg of your venture  so picking up from there as an evening rest comes to you all a night of sleep vax you have  a difficult evening tossing and turning in bed the general ramifications of recent events  surrounding you which as a note as a person whos back from resurrection you are at a  relative penalty for the next few 
none	 days i dont know if you were aware of that  were you aware of that  travis he is now  liam i kind of remember people going through that  matt yep so you have a nights rest after this so thats actually no you traveled on a boat  for a few days that would have gone away thats right because you had to make a whole journey  back to emon so youve rested up heavily in the boat forget i said anything  matt but tossing and turning as the night eventually takes you into 
dung	 subconsciousness you  are plagued with flashes of deepsea darkness lashing tendrils the evergaping maw a beak  swallowing you the light fading and there once again you see emerging from the darkness the same  expressionless solid porcelain mask of the raven queen the voice omnipresent but gentle  strangely warming against the cold of nothing and the voice just calls out ive given you back my  champion but you are still mine you have a purpose do not forget  liam you know well that my heart lies with them both of them all of them but 
none	 i have put my faith  in you and i await your word  matt and wait you shall i sense something on the horizon i sense rousing villainy i sense  twisting the threads of life but it is too far beyond my vision only time will tell but ive  watched your thread and it leads to something bright it leads to something great but your  thread is still clouded at that point i cannot see beyond and as that thread moves it gathers  many around it those youve come to love perhaps their fate is 
none	 tied with yours is that a  responsibility you can bear vaxildan then be patient enjoy the time you have for when this  rousing evil gathers i will need your full attention my champion the mask recedes back  into the darkness the cold overtakes you and suddenly you find yourself shooting up in bed  gasping for breath sweat pours down your face just as a gentle bit of light begins to break over  the sun coming through the window into the bedroom  keyleth you are roused out of your slumber as well hearing him gasp 
none	 and breathe heavily  leaning off the side of the bed  marisha you okay  liam yeah coughs  marisha did you have a nightmare  liam yeah  marisha i have them too  liam i know  marisha do you want to talk about it  liam eventually  marisha okay do you need anything  liam ive everything i need  marisha i do a little bit of druidcraft something like lightning bugs in the room and  make them dance nice and calming just trying to get back to sleep  matt okay you get 
none	  liam we get an extra hour  matt you guys curl up to get back to sleep and as you do and the darkness takes you once more  you hear the faint echoing whisper in the back of your head as you fall back into your dreams and  it says my fatetouched  now the rest of you wake up the next morning its been a while since youve been back in  greyskull keep and it is strangely heartening to be back at home without another constant threat of  death without the looming of dragon 
none	 destruction and it brings back a flood of memories of when you  first had this keep made the innocence of those days and the things youve learned since and the  new appreciations youve gained through the struggles youve had in the process the other thing catches  you is the smell of fresh breakfast being made downstairs  as laina apparently is already on task  travis fuck yeah  all laugh  laura ill run downstairs cant miss that  marisha as i wake up before we head downstairs i grab vax did you get back to 
town	 sleep  are you all right  liam yes you ready for the day  marisha never always yeah no sure lets go  liam youre a born leader come on  marisha thanks  matt you guys come down for breakfast laina is currently rushing around seemingly excited at the  prospect of being back in her kitchen which has been outfitted partially when she returned as  you know most everything was stolen from the keep and it looks like shes made a few trips  into town and has purchased enough to make it functional she comes 
none	 out and she starts bringing  meals she has large piles of plates im really quite sorry but we dont have enough plates for  everyone so if you dont mind sharing for now well go do some purchases  laura i start grabbing bacon from the big piles  marisha yeah same communal style  matt good well i hope its okay  laura its perfect  taliesin oh good plates ill have a plate  sam ill take one as well  liam i reach in front of the boys and grab a big fistful  marisha halfelves 
none	 are just gnawing noises  matt as you guys are eating you hear some heavy footfalls coming from around the corner the first  thing you notice is a familiar female face onceshort red hair has now grown quite long or  at least grown longer to about ear chinlength you see shayne tranter one of the guards that you  originally hired and then moved over to whitestone to guard walk in leather armor on big pack over  her shoulder looks like shes also returned as she comes in she throws her pack down  marisha dwarf right 
none	  matt human human female  marisha wrong note shayne tranter  matt shayne tranter yeah she walks in and throws her pack down ah good morning glad to  see youre all mostly alive  travis did you eat already  matt no is there food  travis too bad no  laura help yourself  taliesin grog please there is food  sam but no plates  taliesin but no plates  matt and you are  sam oh hi there just here for a visit taryon darrington you havent heard of me yet but you  will 
none	 do you work here are you one of our employees  matt im one of their employees yes  sam oh well they made me an official member now so  matt great so youll be the one that pays me then  laura oh  sam we will all chip in for whatever your monthly wages will be  matt unless im mistaken and well unless you canceled our contract mind you we havent been  guarding the keep for a long time so im not going charge you for the time over that we  appreciate you on 
none	 that but we are back on the clock  and this is kind of my only job at the  moment so  laura start guarding  matt all right and she smiles and sits down and she grabs a little bit of food and pulls it  off into her hand and starts eating off her leather gauntleted glove  laura taryon you dont have to worry about paying on this  sam how much do they cost  taliesin a fortune  laura im sure i have it written down somewhere  all laugh  taliesin we have 
none	 books there were books we kept books  laura yeah there were books there was also a dragon attack  sam i fully expect to be treated as a full paying member of this and i will gladly contribute  oneseventh of the salary  laura really not necessary  taliesin its quite all right  sam i insist its literally nothing to me  all laugh  travis someone should teach him the vox machina fight song then  laura you should do it grog  liam oh yeah grog you have the best voice of all of us 
none	  travis yeah do you know the fight song  sam no no ive not learned any fight song most of the songs that ive learned are either  religious in nature or ive read them in books and ive made up my own melodies to them they were  epic poems of yesteryear and i sort of set them to a little melody mostly happy  travis you made up songs then  sam well i  travis no thats good each one of these songs is like personal to the member right so you make  up a 
none	 song about what vox machina means to you  sam i do that  travis yeah  sam wow  travis well need it by sundown tomorrow  sam doty we have some work to do working breakfast  matt doty sits down right next to you  sam machina machina sock in a put a sock in a no vox vox put it in the box  well work on this  laura im scouring my notes for where i wrote their salaries down  taliesin that was a long time ago  laura it was but ive got 
none	 my spiral here  sam theyre 100 gold a month for five of them and then 50 gold a month for the other two thats  vexs memory  laura thats my memory 100 gold a month for each of the guards and then what was the extra  sam five of them get 100 gold a month and two of them get 50 gold a month i dont remember why or  who but thats how i think the guards get 100 and the cooks get 50 or something  matt servants get 50 yeah  marisha see as 
none	 i wrote down i believe shayne cordell jarett kendrick  and nitebe get 100 a month  laura and then we always gave jarett a bonus because he was captain  marisha yeah and because he was hot  matt yeah well there you go although jarett is technically not on your payroll anymore jaretts  now a member of the pale guard in whitestone  laura yeah i remember  marisha thats right so reducing our costs were getting better at this  laura do you know where the rest of the crew is shayne  matt kendrick is 
none	 currently watching up on the wall nitebe i havent seen since you sent him  off to wildmount  laura right  matt and she gets a distant stare for a second and says  well cordell didnt make it through the ordeal  taliesin really  matt you can see her kind of she has that look of somebody who lost a close friend she gets  a distant stare for a second clenches her jaw and then shakes her head  and goes back to eating absentmindedly  marisha we should have some sort of service then or 
dung	 at least a dinner in cordells honor  matt thats up to you ive already had mine my piece has been said  laura well were glad to have you back  matt me too  taliesin glad so many of us survived  matt not everyone  laura do any of us remember why nitebe went to wildmount  matt you sent him a long time ago to look for information about the briarwoods  taliesin oh no  laura oh no  travis we made him a snack  laura we did  travis he turned into a 
none	 hot pocket yall  taliesin did we fight his undead body in the crypt is that oh  matt you have not crossed his path  laura oh no we killed our guard  matt you havent heard anything from him in a long time  taliesin and marisha vox machina not returning your calls since 1992  matt to be fair spies by nature live a very dangerous lifestyle that they accept who knows  what his whereabouts are or if hell ever show up again but you havent heard from him  laura maybe he just took our 
dung	 money and ran  matt its also very possible  laura i doubt it though  taliesin i would feel better about that but probably not  marisha i can try and scry  taliesin i just like the notion that maybe if we just checked one more of those cells in the  dungeon of whitestone  marisha want me to scry on nitebe i can  taliesin you know ill say just because im curious where this particular rabbit hole leads  travis really  laura maybe  taliesin its not like were going to go wherever  
none	 travis were just eating breakfast go for it  laura yeah just scry while were eating breakfast  marisha all right i scry on nitebe  liam i like that this is our breakfast entertainment  taliesin this is our version of looking at our phones this is vox machina going  laura what do you see has he posted anything on facebook lately  travis have we figured out how to project this on a 55inch flat wall monitor for us yet  marisha actually good question  taliesin yes but the frame rate is only 120 frames per 
none	 second  marisha yeah its only in black and white  liam he posted on instagram six weeks ago and that was it  matt all right so are you doing scry on nitebe  marisha yeah  laura what do your scrying eyes see keyleth  matt so as you eat your breakfast you take a moment you finish the small ritual on the center  of the cold stone floor of your mess hall area of the keep you focus on your fuzzy but decent  enough memory of nitebe as the ritual completes your vision focuses out 
none	 for a second and then  returns to you theres no focus theres no nitebe  laura oh no  travis hes a jolly rancher in the belly of craven edge  taliesin what  marisha im afraid the insane things that grog just said is correct  travis i am a powerful magician  marisha yes  liam a happy ranch hand in the  travis yeah hes on the farm hes running through the fields of the farm happy as can be  all the room to run he wants laughs  laura this is actually very terrible 
dung	  taliesin this is really sad in the weirdest way  travis i mean yes this is very dark dark time  laura thats terrible  marisha travis  taliesin i know i cant  liam were laughing at ourselves we havent thought of this guy in 72 years  taliesin prestream its been since prestream that this has come up  liam yeah  taliesin okay wow  laura well  travis zero focus nothing  matt theres no creature to receive the scrying spell  liam my breakfast is not tasting as good  matt which means hes 
none	 either on another plane of existence or hes fucking dead  all laugh  taliesin is that this version of hes in the feywild everythings fine right now  matt you sent him to the great spy farm upstate  marisha whatever timeline you believe in  laura at least weve avenged him in a way  sam did he have a family what was his mothers name  all laugh  sam because we might want to send her a gift or some sort of a tribute in coin  laura yeah ill get right on that yeah  
none	 marisha theres got to be public record right  laura yeah yeah anywho were down a few servants we should probably get some more guards  hey shayne do you have anyone youd recommend  matt honestly me and cordell worked as a team for a long time we didnt really make friends i  can go looking in the city for you  travis no  laura thats all right  taliesin keep your eyes open we trust your judgment  matt unless you want to go look for yourself i dont mind going and finding some good candidates 
none	  laura find a few more  matt yeah  marisha i feel like the city is pretty overwhelmed at the moment though  matt up to you  laura a lot of keeps have been ruined guards might be looking for work actually  matt yeah people looking for work right now you look like youve got more important things to  focus on so if you want to hire some guards and you have trust in me throw me some cash and i can  probably bring some people in  marisha how do you feel about your 
none	 workload do you feel like you can handle this  matt i can handle it she shakes the bit of scrambled eggs from her gauntleted hand  laura good leading good leading keyleth  travis hows your keep bandwidth right now is your plate full  laura this is shitty can i roll for insight and make sure that shes trustworthy i feel like  shes trustworthy but  matt totally  laura i rolled poorly for my insight  matt what did you roll even if you roll poorly with the bonuses  laura 13  matt 13 she 
none	 seems pretty straight  laura all right  matt shes straight with you shes not trying to layer it at all  taliesin weve got a trip to take so perhaps when we get back we can audition some new  candidates thatll be fun youll enjoy that  sam yes i would enjoy anything  taliesin oh its quite fun its quite nice  sam i love me some fun  travis are you going to audition these new guards like we did you  matt oh i can figure something out dont worry  laura i like it 
town	 make sure theyre trustworthy if were not going to be around and i hand her  500 gold for herself and for kendrick  matt yes  laura and the three that you hire  matt all right ill get on it then i think i should have some time to go into town and do this  here within the afternoon she grabs another roll off the table and takes a bite of it  glad to have you back and she turns around  and leaves the room  travis i like her  laura shes cool  
none	 travis yep doesnt say too much  taliesin now i remember why we hired her in the first place  travis because she fought well she fought a giant fucking scorpion in the courtyard what are  we doing today  marisha well we talked about going to the cobalt reserve to drop off this  laura to drop off the evil book and do a little research on the nine fucking hells  marisha and then  taliesin we need to do a bit of shopping but then we do have youre not quite done are you  marisha 
none	 i mean theres that  taliesin im putting it out there  liam yeah you up for it  travis what  laura shes got to get crowned  travis laughs  taliesin wow i watched that work its way from your ear all the way to your brain there  travis youre going to get crowned really  taliesin it got lost on the way it was amazing  laura even larger antlers  travis wow  marisha yeah its weird i dont know  travis does it sit on your head or on the antlers  taliesin they 
none	 decorate it like a winters festival  liam they put antlers on the antlers  matt you do actually know though youve never seen anyone wear it because in the time that  youve been learning there hasnt been a formal voice of the tempest its not a crown its more  of a mantle its a ceremonial mantle  laura so you just hold it like a giant mantle  marisha well not like a fireplace mantle although i could technically transform into a  fireplace now  travis why  marisha because im a badass  laura gasps 
none	 you could turn into doors  marisha you know i could im pretty sure  matt creature  marisha no i could hang on hang on  laura a mimic  marisha a mimic couldnt i turn into a mimic that could be a door or a mantle  matt well you havent seen a door mimic before because i dont hate you that much yet  liam we havent seen a base mimic before  laura yeah we have  liam in this game  matt you have seen a mimic yeah  liam i dont remember it

none	 just creatures  marisha its fine  laura okay what are we fucking doing what are we doing  matt its different creature if you encounter a doorshaped creature in the future you can  totally do that  taliesin please im sure youre having all sorts of reservations and thoughts and processes about  this notion but i will admit i have yet to introduce your sister to the best part of being  titled which is dressing up and it would be a coronation we could get some clothes we could  wear something lovely  liam does 
none	 that jive with your hometown though kiki dressing up  marisha yeah  taliesin its a sign of respect  travis do all people with titles have to dress up  taliesin yes  travis are you sure  taliesin i am  marisha were very openminded  laura oh grand poobah im afraid you have to wear something quite formal  travis you know what breakfast is disagreeing with me i think i have to go back to bed  taliesin heavy is the head that wears the crown  travis gags yeah i dont feel well ive got

none	 i guess it is that notion of leading up to this one moment that youve thought of for a  while once you complete that what happens next  laura its just like getting married keyleth  marisha is it though yeah  laura its all the planning that just freaks you out thats all  marisha yeah sure  liam what do you know about that  taliesin i was going to say is that theoretical or experiential  laura theoretical obviously  taliesin okay just checking  liam she does read a lot or she used to

none	  matt you hear the heavy footfalls upstairs of grogs feet and a door slamming shut  taliesin he took his time  marisha do we need an extra day to convince grog to wear pants that could be the deciding factor  maybe we should put it on him right  laura keyleth  marisha what  laura make a decision  marisha groans  laura leader youre going to be a leader just make a choice  liam everybody else believes in you why shouldnt you  taliesin pencil or pen  marisha laughs  laura im looking

town	 fashion week happening  liam theyre both handicapped arent they  laura thats what i mean  matt theyve both been under some recent duress so it really could go either way emon is  definitely more of the cultural hub especially since its such a huge port town you get a lot  more cultural influence from other continents and heavier trade emon would probably have better  outfits but westruun which grog you grew up in and you guys have spent some time in does  have its own textiles district there are weddings that happen there they 
none	 have other events where  they sell fine  liam whats westruun like pittsburgh  matt you could say yeah  travis its like wisconsin  taliesin okay thats less disappointing  matt emons the new york westruuns the pittsburgh  taliesin whitestones the boulder  matt kind of yeah laughs  taliesin its boulder colorado  liam yeah i like it  taliesin theres nothing happening  travis boulder baby  laura but its beautiful  marisha if its the pittsburgh then we should go now because everything closes at five  liam we could also tree stride to 
none	 vasselheim for the fanciest of shopping  if you want to go allout  taliesin in theory theyll have your crest on file thats one of those things any dressmaker  would actually know how to assemble something appropriate for any house  of any nobility that exists  laura you know what vasselheim will actually know a little bit about orcus and i bet the nine  hells as well being the god hub  taliesin ooh a work vacation  marisha we did mention if we wanted to drop off the book at westruun or vasselheim  laura

none	 disguise kit its not an ability per se  liam i have imposter right  matt right you have imposter  liam thats me can i use it on a robot  sam by the way liam if you dont have this ability i want to see this even more  liam oh were doing it  marisha just bluff your way through it  matt no because imposter is the ability to mimic somebody else it has nothing to do a disguise  kit is what youre using  liam and ive always had a disguise kit  matt 
town	 correct  liam because i did something back in the home game i did something  matt yeah youve done a couple of things but its not an ability you have  liam no  matt well you do have an ability but its only for you its not for doty  taliesin you own a cardboard box with a bunch of stuff  matt so heres what we do first and foremost you have to go to the town and gather supplies  because your disguise kit is designed for very small prosthetics and things  this is a 
town	 large endeavor  liam this is five times that  matt yeah so im going to need you to roll an investigation check this is your ability to go  around the town and find through the midst of chaos of emon trying to repair itself somebody  who can sell you the supplies necessary  liam well that is a 20  taliesin i need some clay  matt a natural 20  liam no not a natural 20  matt but a 20 thats still fine all right it takes you  taliesin i gave him a list 
none	  matt it takes you about three hours round trip to go into the city locate the location and  purchase relatively inexpensive comparatively about ten gold pieces for materials to do this  which is expensive for anyone whos just and a lot of it is burlap material thats gone over with  a weatherproofing liquid that when it solidifies it gives almost a rubbery texture its used for  carts that are traveling a long distance under bad weather and you figure that might resemble some  sort of a skintype texture at a distance you gather other 
none	 elements to build a mask to wrap  things in material to block things that might look metallic so yeah so you gather things that  might work in your favor so as you collect this what are you guys working on  sam were making a mask  taliesin well the first thing that were going to need is were going to need a way of  connecting this to him without limiting his movement so im making so its a very accessible  easy harness to get this on and off and starting to design and put together 
none	 how were going to  what id like to make is a couple a porcelain cover for the hands and face so that it actually  looks like perhaps it wont draw immediate suspicion but if it does it will look like  somebody with an artificial limb maybe theyve been hurt  liam get me ten sets of scissors  matt laughs so are you crafting the porcelain  taliesin i am ive got the kiln  matt yes but your materials youre used to using  taliesin instead of porcelain im going for the ceramics that i use 
town	 for some of my build its  more practical ive been working on some jewelry shit i could genuinely learn how to do this  matt this is true but the skillset for jewelry is very different from the skillset of porcelain  liam i need you to make a rig like in a video game can you do that  laura im going go into town and buy some plates for laina  matt okay i will say  taliesin im willing to have this  sam we could just use mud from outside  matt do you have 
none	 a set of potters tools because that would be specifically what would be used for  this if youre going to be working with ceramics and porcelain  taliesin can i roll to see because i have a kiln so i might have it  but i dont know if i have it  matt but you have a kiln thats designed more for its more of a metaluse forge  taliesin its more of a metaluse forge  matt so itll destroy ceramics it burns at a certain heat  travis this could be the dumbest  marisha this 
none	 is the best thing weve ever wasted time on  matt im so excited  taliesin if prototype one fails ill make it out of pewter  matt okay this is an adjacent skill set youre not going to get your proficiency bonus to it but  you do have materials to essentially try it i want you to go ahead and roll a base dexterity  check just add your dexterity modifier youre not proficient  taliesin im trusting in gil because he also cant make a pot  travis say the thing say the incantation  taliesin mecca 
none	 lecca high mecca hiney ho dont fuck me gil  marisha where are those pottery tools gil  taliesin and those pottery tools are  marisha laughs its a good roll  taliesin 22  matt 22 it takes you the better part of the next two hours but you manage to create some  taliesin thank you for helping me ghost by the way never mind  matt they have to cool and harden but in the process of crafting it and heating it you do have  some decent ceramic plates that you think might work theyre going 
none	 to be fragile  taliesin thats fine  matt not like theyll crumble on their own walking but if they take any sort of chip and  damage the ceramic  taliesin hands and face is what i was hoping for  matt ill say the better part of two hours or so to craft them and then you begin to heat them in  the kiln itll take you a while for them to harden and set  taliesin okay and were just figuring out a little easy armature that wont get in his way  and im peeking 
none	 at him seeing how he works  matt all right the armature roll tinkers kit check proficiency plus dex  sam im going to oh sorry  taliesin you can assist  matt actually this would be proficiency plus intellect is what it would be because this is  trying to figure it out specifically  taliesin id be happy for an assist unless youre doing something  sam i was going upstairs to ask one of the help something  taliesin oh go ahead okay thats fine ill just work on your robot by myself then 21  matt 
none	 okay easy enough to figure out a harness what are you doing tary  sam what was the servants name who you said used to have short hair now long  matt shayne  sam i go to her him  matt its a her she will punch you so hard  sam i offer to buy her hair for 100 gold pieces to use as a wig  matt how do you say this  all laugh  matt shes literally outside sitting on the outside wall of the gate leaning forward just on  a stool with a

none	 well you have  beautiful hair i wouldnt mind if you would lend it to the cause id like to  buy your hair for 100 gold pieces  all laugh  matt go ahead and roll a persuasion check  liam oh my god wheres shorthalt when you need him  laura did he roll well  taliesin im not saying  sam persuasion 24  matt she goes youre kidding me right  sam oh no no no and i reach into my bag of holding and pull out 100 gold and say it would  mean a 
dung	 lot to me and to my teammates if you would cooperate in this mission  it might even save a life  matt she gives you this long stern dark look laughs make it 500 and you got a deal  sam 500 all right fine  all laugh  sam and a bargain at that  matt ah it was getting too long anyway she makes her way down the ladder and just walks past  you into the keep comes back about half an hour later head completely shaved smooth and shes  got in a little square

none	  matt laughs all right so you guys make your way up to the platinum sanctuary you head to the  base of the central mountain that the north end of vasselheim is built around to the winding stair  that leads up to the sanctuary proper there as you ascend you can see the sun is getting to the  three to four oclock in the afternoon position the color of the skys starting to turn a bit  different you guys make your way to the outside doors of the sanctuary where you see the guards  are 
none	 there stationed and as you approach some of them put up a bit of an aggressive front from a  defensive standpoint but one of them does recognise you and approaches pulls the front of  his helmet up you are vox machina  laura we are  matt what business do you have here at the platinum sanctuary  laura we have come to discuss the whispers horn of orcus that we delivered here a while ago  matt so you request an audience with scalebearer vord  laura mmhm  liam yeah that guy  travis the sphinxs 
none	 name  laura what  travis the sphinxs name  laura i dont remember  matt laughs all righty highbearer vord he says very well please to be patient i believe  he is busy  laura oh right  matt and he heads inside the doors close behind  laura as he does that i look to vax and go hey i have an idea so the book we have right  liam mm  laura what if instead of leaving it here we left it at the raven queens sanctuary dont you think  they would keep it 
none	 more safe because she hates undead right this is like her nemesis right  liam she does yeah i mean thats a whole thing i dont think thats a bad idea but i feel  like if i go there i need to stay for a bit  laura oh really  liam yeah  laura do you want to do that  liam no not yet  laura all right cool lets forget i mentioned anything  liam lets do that  laura all right  matt all right about 15 minutes or so pass as you guys are 
none	 led up its a gorgeous view  from up here by the way i mean for vasselheim the cloud cover is probably 70 to 80 of the year  with coming storms and sleet this is one of the few days youve been during this part of the  season where the sky is open you actually see some blue in the sky and as the light of the day  begins to grow more towards a dusk color you start seeing the distant change and its just endless  thick dense forest of the vesper timberland all around the 
none	 city and so theres kind of this  serene waiting period as well  laura i just lean against trinket  matt trinket just bear noises you calm trinket a bit trinket doesnt like heights and is up here  on this platform its literally like a very small rail and then it drops probably a good 150 200  feet down and so trinkets just like staying as far away from the edge as possible eventually the  doors shift and one side opens up slightly the same guard walks out all right very well  follow me turns 
none	 around leads you in hes carrying his large very wellpolished tower  shield to his side he still has his helmet visor up leads you into the central structure  laura do we know what were going to say  liam were going to talk about the book were going to ask them if they can destroy it  laura or hold it right do something with it  liam preferably destroy  laura okay its history though  liam its dangerous  laura true  matt you guys are led to the audience chamber surrounded by the wide den 
none	 of pillars and the  central area has a hole above the top of the temple where the light comes through and there you  see stepping in hurriedly from the opposite side flanked by two advisors is highbearer vord the  silver touched you see his elven form is very finefeatured his skin still very pale almost  pearlescent when the light hits it and his robes flow behind him dragging a good four or five feet  across the center its such an open space between the circular pillars that hold this its just  this tiny image 
none	 of him approaching you amongst this wideopen space with his two advisors as the  footsteps get louder and louder as he approaches so yes youve summoned me  what is your business  laura didnt mean to summon you scalebearer i know your time is precious  matt yes  laura we however came across in fighting the chroma conclave and defeating them this book  which references opashs search into necromancy necromancy necromancy  sam necromancy  matt necromancy josh necromancy  liam necromancy  laura necrome yes  travis necromé  laura necromé  liam laughs does 
none	 that name mean anything to you  matt i have read of it yes i mean its a creature of lore opash was before the divergence  even if you indeed found a tome that once belonged to him this is of much interest to us  and our network of researchers  liam research  laura researchers  matt well yes  laura its an evil tome  matt i can only assume it is you are right  liam we came to vasselheim to dispose of it my sister has read it parts of it and  laura 
none	 whispers all of it  liam its foul it should not be allowed to exist  matt we can ensure that it falls into no hands beyond this temple however we do have to  research the contents you understand the necessity of understanding the evils and darkness  that are out there that when they arise we can properly counter them  laura can i insight check him  matt yes go for it  laura groans  travis turd burgers  laura its not terrible but it aint good 14  matt 14 hes hard to read in 
none	 general disposition and station and his eyes are so  white like the iris is almost not visible and hes stonefaced in his explanation but hes making  sense you know if you have information on  laura necromancy  matt on necromancy  laura yes  taliesin jif  matt or any devices that darker forces utilize it better prepares you if  you know what those entail  laura right  matt and if there is any place that could withstand the corruption of such a book it would  be the strongest focus of the platinum dragons 
none	 divine power that exists on the planet  laura well thats good  matt so you get the sense that vord is not deceiving you  laura okay  liam what happens after you research it  matt we seal it in the vaults below same place we stored the horn  liam has that vault ever been disturbed in its entire history  matt its been a long time and weve reinforced it if i recall last time you were here you  encountered some of our defense yourselves  laura yes  matt i think youll know by 
dung	 memory that we are well fortified so  laura be warned the book tried to claim me  matt hmm if you resisted it i have no doubt our clerics can as well he nods his head over to  one of his advisors  travis shade  laura i know yeah  travis dark shade  matt this young man with a very very tight braid pulled to the back of the head that dangles about  midback behind silver and white robes just approaches and puts his hands out  to accept the tome  liam oh im 
none	 sorry we werent clear we came to discuss it we dont have it now  matt puts his hands aside and steps back oh well return with the tome should you see fit to  leave it here  laura can i ask you how much do you know of orcus  matt i know enough  laura i dont know much of anything and its important that we learn  matt hmm so he nods to one of the other advisors who steps off for a moment sit a  moment this is a conversation to have and some 
none	 of the guards come and bring a few chairs and set  them behind you orcus the demon prince of undeath resides in the depths of thanatos one of  the varying realms of the abyss it is here that he snuffs the life from all creatures and brings  them under his sway he is an entity of everhungering need for power and to take all  life and break it so he can bring it under his control thankfully as one of the betrayer gods  he was sealed away and the divine gate was placed up to 
none	 prevent his and any other evil entities  entrance into our world however that does not prevent him from sending his minions sending his  powers sending his influence out through the permeable small gaps in this gate so his  influence remains  laura he only has two horns right  matt oh four once  laura four  matt two that he maintains on himself to this day and two that were severed enchanted and  bequeathed into two of his at the time one of his champions  liam and all these many months youve been in 
none	 possession of the horn you have  matt yes  laura and you dont have another one down in that vault  matt we do not  liam what have you learned of the one you do have  matt well this belonged to a great and terrible champion of orcus it was utilized in the  calamity the war that came to the very gates of vasselheim this armored evil was destroyed and  torn asunder the horn scattered we currently have some of our finest and brightest out in  search of the other one now that we 
none	 know they have and can be recovered not to any avail yet  but were doing our best  laura if you hear any word of that horn will you send word to us  matt of course and you do the same please  laura of course  matt one was dangerous enough  liam we need to discuss a few things but well fetch the tome  matt very well  laura thank you so much for your time  matt i dont have much of it if you have business to discuss with me personally i would 
none	  recommend doing it now otherwise youll be dealing with one of my advisors when you return  laura do you know much about the nine hells  matt thats a complicated subject what do you need to know  laura i fear we have to travel there  matt why pray tell do you intend to travel there  laura there is a rakshasa after my brother and our cleric friend pike and unfortunately i  fear he will return if we dont snuff him out at the source  liam its already made one attempt  matt hmm 
none	  liam its only a matter of time  matt ive dealt with fiends ive dealt with devils i am not a specialist on the hells but  there are a few places where you could possibly research this information majority of such  research is found in the presence or at least in the grasp of the cobalt soul they do have one  small temple here in the city and they have one over in taldorei either one will have some  semblance of research at their disposal what i can tell you is in asking about orcus 
none	 and the  abyss those are demons entities savage chaotic in selfish hard to read societies that  twist crumble and rebuild a rate that only insanity can seem to drive madness and hunger  drives the abyss but the hells the hells are built on tyranny they are built on societies  power structures subservience and dominance whereas few mortals dare tread in the abyss there  have been some from many different realms who go to the hells to do business  laura do you know what sort of people might survive there  liam or fit in 
none	  matt powerful ones ones that stay out of sight ones that dont make a scene just know theyre  very clever and above all else they seek your soul  laura all right  liam no big  laura all right  liam thank you for your time  laura so well go to the cobalt reserve  matt all right one of my advisors will receive the tome upon its delivery  laura fabulous thank you  matt good luck  laura whistles  matt he stands up and as soon as you begin to stand up the 
none	 seats are already immediately pulled  out from behind you the guards separate them he leaves with his advisors and you guys are led out  of the temple back onto the winding staircase and into the heart of vasselheim  liam i pull vex into an alleyway sighs i dont know what the right thing to do is i thought one  thing going in there  laura mmhm  liam and now i think maybe you were right i have not wanted to go to that temple though she has  finally been speaking to me again  
none	 laura all right what about  liam when i died i saw her i have dreamed of her already and she speaks of some sort of  purpose on the horizon and i dont know if shes talking about your promise you made or what but  she is with us and i barely know what the fuck im doing but i know that she doesnt want that  book to exist and honestly i am frightened of going to that temple because i want time i want  time with you i want time with keyleth i want time 
none	  laura all right  liam and i dont want to lose that time now i want to be selfish for a little while weve been  working so fucking hard by all rights we should be dead  laura do you think if you go to the raven queens temple shell claim you for her own right now  liam well i dont know i dont know and look at this and i start to unbuckle the front of my  chest relax look at this  laura what am i seeing laughs  matt you see right around 
dung	 his heart theres a dark spot in the skin where some dark veins travel  for about an inch or two across  laura what the fuck is this  liam i dont know  laura when did it happen  liam i dont know  laura what do you mean you dont know did it happen after you died  liam i think so hurts a little bit  laura what the fuck we have to get you to a cleric thats not normal  liam not really no i cover it back up  laura are you sure 
none	 its related to her  liam but i think you are right and i think that theyre going to hold that and someone will take  it whether its in a hundred years or a thousand years and she doesnt want it and  laura well theyre holding the horn of orcus playing devils advocate  liam yeah they already have that they dont have this  laura then lets go to the raven queens temple  liam all right  laura do you want to go now  liam yes  laura lets go  matt okay while you 
dung	 guys make your way to the ravens eyrie we go to you two you guys are  currently looking for a library who wants to make the investigation check to ask for information  taliesin ill do it thats funny  laura would i have known anything about what that thing was  matt not really it doesnt look diseased it looks bruised almost its just a strangelooking  bruise where you can see some of the veins are dark and visible  almost like varicose near the surface  laura like trauma  matt kind of yeah but it 
none	 doesnt look  laura it doesnt look like raishans  matt no its not like that  marisha so we have the book they went to the sanctuary we are going to the library  matt yes  taliesin okay  marisha okay  matt as far as i know thats what you guys are searching for  laura wait i thought we had the book  taliesin its in the wait no the books in the bag  travis and im the one with the low intelligence  matt singsong grog has the book  marisha you guys i 
none	 thought our whole thing was that we were taking the book to the sanctuary and  then you guys were like were going to the sanctuary because you guys totally gave me shit  when i was like the library and you were like not the library but apparently we are  taliesin yes  marisha all right lets go to the library  taliesin i rolled a 16  matt its like vox machina has a hard time planning  all laugh  taliesin dont agree with him  matt its crazy  taliesin thats not fair  sam 
none	 im the new guy  all laugh  travis im the new guy  taliesin 16 investigation  marisha we said we had the book  taliesin we thought we did we were not paying attention  matt did you say you took the book  marisha i thought we took the book that was our whole fucking plan  taliesin i thought we took the book too  marisha  that we took the damn book  taliesin it occurs to me it was actually in the bag that grog was holding  marisha but i would assume if 
none	 we said were taking the book that would mean  matt if you guys said youre taking the book grog you heard them take the book  travis i thought you said you were taking the book to go look at the wherever  marisha we have the book  matt all right ill take that as consensus to say that you guys have the book  sam oh i used the book to make the wig is that okay  all laugh  sam its just its all paper  laura its glued under the cloak  matt make 
none	 a wisdom saving throw  taliesin papiermâché of evil  matt okay you guys not having a bag of holding are clutching the tome  its a big tome its like  marisha i thought we put it in a box right  matt no  taliesin no we didnt have a box  laura there was no box it was a book wrapped in cloth in the bag of holding  sam in a box  marisha we wrapped it in cloth  matt so there you go you have a tome wrapped in cloth under your arm you 
none	 guys spend about an hour  or so asking around the locals theyre not saying theyre not friendly but not all of them  are wellversed in what youre asking you say library some of them are more simpler folk are  like i dont and eventually somebody says oh yeah you can head over to the whats it  called the cobalt vault its in the southern region of the quad roads  taliesin thats exactly what i was looking for thank you so much  matt all right yeah ill show you and the guy gives you a 
town	 couple directions down the road  and you make your way there and its similar to the cobalt reserve in westruun but its about a  quarter of the size  marisha okay  matt the cobalt reserve is the center of the cobalt soul monk order the ioun worshipers that  gather information and maintain it as iouns presence was shattered slightly during the  calamity in the battle against the chained god her presence in vasselheim was diminished and then  regrew through the cobalt soul in westruun so its expanding back into vasselheim you make your  
none	 way to the structure the exterior of it is this lightgrey stone its a cylindrical building with  three different doorways around the outside and a giant bright blue and black marbled dome on top  it looks somewhat transparent like its made of a glasstype material as you step into the front  you can see a central chamber within the inside thats also cylindrical so you have a small  walkaround hallway on the immediate inside of this giant structure and then the actual library  is in the interior and so on the outside you see a 
dung	 few books and there are some paintings and  tapestries on the walls and you see a few varying monks walking around a handful that are curious  and turn as you walk in theyre all wearing the uniform dark grey and blue robes of the cobalt  soul and there is a desk at the front where you have a young woman of olive skin sitting her hair  short and wavy with very thick spectacles adorning the front of her nose youngish maybe  midtwenties she looks up as soon as you guys approach good day i fear 
none	 were still in the  process of preparing the interior but what do you require  taliesin we were hoping for access to some of the deep research archives weve been looking around  we have several complicated matters that we need to research and we heard that you had a wonderful  collection and we were hoping to gain access to some materials preferably of the histories of  orcus the nine hells a few various things  matt im terribly sorry that type of research is only for cobalt soul members  taliesin who could we talk to 
none	 about special access  im sure that there must be somebody in charge  matt i apologize i am  marisha im sorry  matt im going to have  marisha i am keyleth of the air ashari and this is percival fredrickstein von musel  klossowski de rolo iii  taliesin close enough  marisha were a part of the group vox machina weve been through here before were part of the  slayers take this is a matter of great importance so if there is any type of upper  management we could talk to  all laugh 
none	  matt roll a persuasion check  travis fuck this its just that dismount at the end  taliesin creepy voice who wants to talk to the librarian  matt its keyleths specialty  liam it was going great  marisha coughs mm 11  matt i mean no offense but i dont think we have the kind of research that youre looking for  that we could  taliesin we would also possibly like to make a donation and i pull out the manual of quickness  of action place it upon the table  matt she adjusts her 
none	 glasses for a second and reaches into the desk and pulls out a small white  gem and passes it over and as she does you can see the front of the tome seems to glow almost  like a blacklight over something that was reactive to it  sam covered in semen  matt as soon as i said it i was waiting for sam on that one  sam sure sure  taliesin thank you for ruining that one for me for all time  matt scans over perhaps give me just a moment please and she slides 
none	 the book in your  direction gets up and exits through one of the small doors in the side that you didnt notice  until now its part of a similar stone just gives way and then closes behind her  taliesin well well see what happens now  marisha and yet worst case scenario i also have this book that scanlan read thats on how to be a  good leader  taliesin hold on to that one  marisha all right ill hold on to it  matt the door opens again and she comes back out followed 
dung	 by a man of very very dark skin bright  soft eyes that crack on the sides from you can gather a lot of smiling he wears the same  uniform blue and gray robes but as he walks you can hear what sounds almost like a faint almost  like jewelry clanging but you dont see any jewelry on him and as he approaches his arms are  folded into themselves and he steps forward quietly looks at the book for a second looks up  at the two of you and smiles hello my name is kusuo and 
none	 i am in charge of looking over this  extension of the cobalt reserves reach and collection  you have come to offer this book as trade  taliesin yes  matt and you are seeking what  taliesin well we are in a bit of a bind we are members of a traveling group of adventurers known  as vox machina we recently helped defeat the chroma conclave  matt im familiar with your exploits as of late yes it is our job to collect information and  history and record of it so i am very aware  
none	 taliesin well the deeds and those things that must be done have not yet been fulfilled we have  just a few last treacherous events that we must complete before the chroma conclave is completely  put to rest one of which has to do with orcus and the other with the nine hells  marisha its a rakshasa  taliesin and we are desperate for knowledge that may keep us safe in our travels prepare us for  our enemies  matt come with me and he takes the book and sweeps it up and it vanishes into his 
none	 robe  taliesin worth it  matt he leads you into the small doorway that you watched open and shut before and on the inside  you go from this barren outer walkway into this large cylindrical library that is from floor to  ceiling about 60 feet tall with dozens of ladders that move around and you can see books are in the  process of being put up some books are being categorized it looks like there were stacks that  have just arrived that are in the process of being researched and copied there are a number 
none	 of these  monks that are at different tables in the process of making copies of books this is specifically a  repository for the gathering and guarding of information in the center of the chamber there  is a spiral staircase that leads to an upper platform that has another series of chairs either  a research or reading section and there are only a handful of people on the interior that are not  dressed in the same way that these monks are but each one of them is attended by a monk and you  marisha anyone 
none	 look familiar any uniforms that look recognizable  matt make a perception check  taliesin yeah use that one thats weird  marisha its on another dice all right  taliesin there thats better  marisha oh thats good  taliesin what is that oh  marisha thats a 19 perception  matt perception  marisha 21 sorry 20 yeah 21  matt okay so you glance around  marisha no 31  matt there we go i was like your wisdoms pretty high  marisha 31  matt okay you look around really fast glance at each person that 
none	 is not of the cobalt reserves  attire no one you recognize but they all appear to be fairly affluent and theyre all in the  process of reading through some sort of thick book with a stack next to them of varying sizes and  the monk is just standing there patiently watching them as they do so  taliesin thats disconcerting  matt and you recall from your first time at the cobalt reserve that no books can be taken from  the reserve they can be read within the interior they can be copied notes can be 
none	 taken but you  cannot remove them and the monk that is assigned to you is both a guide and to make sure you dont  take anything youre not supposed to  marisha right theft protection  matt yes and it seems that kusuo has taken upon himself to be your assigned monk  taliesin theres quite a bustle today this is impressive  matt it is more than we are used to usually but we are happy to know that people are  interested in knowledge any given day  marisha any reason for the sudden spark in 
none	 interest  matt well recent events of dragons terrorizing countrysides leads people to want to defend  themselves and learn of these occasional terrors  marisha good on them  matt anyway follow me and he leads you to the back of the spiral staircase as it comes and  meets with the floor there is a large rug that sits as part of the decor there and he glances  around and using his foot his toe clips the edge of it and flicks up and catches the rug folds it  and sets it down in one swift 
none	 motion you werent expecting and with the dust that sets off you  now see what looks to be a trap door of the same material as the hardwood floor of the library the  small chain that he then bends down carefully tugs and lifts and you see the staircase that  descends below  marisha can you do that with your toes  taliesin not with my toes no  liam thats some name of the rose shit right there  matt the books you require we keep in the cellar so please after you its a staircase 
none	  all laughs  taliesin no im committed  matt laughs youre just going down  liam then an escalator  matt youre dog paddling your way through the darkness you guys descend and the trap door  closes behind you and it is pitch black you have no vision you can see in the vicinity the stairs  go down maybe 20 feet however as soon as the trap door closes a soft glow emanates from behind you  and you can see there is some sort of a dangling wristband with a small glass marble that hangs at 
none	  the end that is now glowing with a soft candlelight and kusuo is holding his arm in front  of him as it dangles like a candle and he slowly brushes past you and leads the way down before the  stairs stop and level off into an open chamber a square room the cellar as he called it there  inside you see candelabras flickering in the corners theres four of them two near you and  two on the far side within the shadowed subterranean chamber you see shelves and locked  cases throughout some cases are 
none	 glass some are almost cratelike but they have locks on the  sides and on these shelves it isnt books stacked to each end each book is facing forward and  seems to be placed deliberately and some of them are chained in some of them have chains that  dangle from the piece this is where all the secret books are kept  this is the private collection  taliesin books that want to get out  matt as soon you guys enter the space two monks of the cobalt soul spin out of the corners and  immediately 
none	 stand in the defensive position with their arms out in front of them and then as soon  as they see kusuo smiles and nods they put their guard down arms together and they bow for kusuo  kusuo turns back over the shoulder do not worry this is wailen and sura they are assigned to  watch over so stand aside help our guests he walks forward and leads you through some of these  cases and you look and theyre made of different woods some of them seem to have been brought from  different locations and there 
none	 are scroll cases there are giant wads of ancient parchment that are  clustered together and bound with some sort of a leather strip you can see tomes all across the  way of different fronts and sizes and some of them are very old and ruined and in the back  right corner of this chamber you see kusuo pulls what you didnt notice before and that jangling  sound you were hearing before is a giant ring of over a hundred keys that he pulls off of his neck  he turns it and begins just thumbing through 
none	 the keys very quickly like he knows exactly what  hes doing catches one key looks at it and walks over to one of the cases in that corner of  the room and just undoes the locks but theyre a different key for each lock and he goes and finds  each one first try knows exactly where they go as each lock is taken he opens the case and on  the inside you smell this scent of dust and ash and there are four books in there two of which  look damaged but they all look 
none	 very old and he reaches in and grabs two of them one of them is  one of the damaged ones one of them is not you seek information on orcus sets one tome down on  one of the nearby closed cases and the nine hells places the other next to it  taliesin i just try and see if i can discern what the other two books are just from looking in and  being a nerd  matt they dont have any labelling on the cover  taliesin oh nothing all right fascinating thank you i suppose 
none	 well sit and get to it  matt very well  taliesin and i sit down and i open the book  marisha yes which one are you opening  taliesin before i touch it this doesnt react poorly to people handling it does it  theres no  matt he arcs an eyebrow towards you no part of our distinct training is to disable any sort of  wards should you wish to research  taliesin excellent  marisha which one are you opening percy  taliesin i open the first one just to look into  marisha the 
none	 orcus one  matt do you speak abyssal  taliesin i do not speak abyssal  matt the orcus tome you arent able to read it is all in abyssal  taliesin do you speak abyssal and the other book  matt the other book  taliesin  i open up the nine hells take a look  matt that one is actually written in common  taliesin okay  marisha weird question  matt yes  marisha abyssal  matt yes  marisha i know creatures who are from the abyss right ive encountered them  matt you have 
none	 encountered demons in your past yes  marisha if i do a shapechange into a demon can i then read abyssal  matt lemme look at the spell real fast  sam youre going to change into a pit fiend in the library  marisha i would let him know i would give him like a disclaimer  taliesin im going to show you a really weird birthmark dont panic  laura i mean if he really was a demon why would he need to do research  taliesin who is my father i dont know  laura genealogy of 
none	 the nine hells  matt it does not specify but it says you gain the abilities  liam i think ive read it says you keep the same intellect though right  matt yeah you keep the same intellect  marisha you keep the same mental stats  matt correct  marisha but you get the abilities  matt yeah you retain all your skills and saving throw and proficiencies in addition to gaining  those of the creature  marisha in addition  matt you dont know  marisha i dont know  sam might as well try  
none	 taliesin im going to take a moment also before this happens open the common book take a moment  and gently ask the good sir if they have a reading glass around because i still dont have any  reading glasses  matt laughs he gives a curious look but of course and he snaps his fingers and the other  monks he just darts off for a second and then returns a moment later with a small wooden case  that opens up and on the inside there are four different types and thickness of reading glass you  
none	 can go through you find one thatll work okay  taliesin perfect im going to let you deal with this other end of things because im going to sit  and read  marisha what was that demon guy we encountered does he have a name  taliesin phil  sam you mean the pit fiend or  laura oh you mean like senokir  liam no he was a genasii  marisha the pit fiend was a devil who was the guy who lied to us and you said devil at one  point and he was actually a 
none	 demon  laura you said he was a demon and he was actually a devil  matt that was a glabrezu that was what killed pike  taliesin what about the basement way back when  travis where we found you  taliesin yeah remember  laura the succubus  matt that was after you found percy this was in the palace of emon  laura what about the succubus  liam the succubus and that thing with the bones  marisha succubus are yeah  laura we did kill a succubus  matt you did yeah  liam in 
none	 kriegs house  marisha and theyre demons right  matt they are fiends youre not sure you dont have enough knowledge  are you trained in religion  marisha no  taliesin but you could ask me well im not  matt yeah youre not too familiar part of this research is learning the distinguishing factors  between fiends you dont have a whole lot of knowledge of that  marisha okay you know what youre reading the book on the nine hells thatll tell us what  fiends there are  taliesin all right  marisha right  matt 
none	 maybe  taliesin maybe im reading the book  marisha read the book  matt okay there we go  all laugh  liam saviors of the universe we are  matt so  taliesin do you know the dewey decimal system  marisha yes laughs  matt whatre you trying to find do you want to just read all the information itll take you  taliesin im skipping specifically through orcus and also since she mentions what shes  matt theres no orcus in this book this is about the nine hells  taliesin oh im so sorry hierarchies 
none	 im trying to get a general overlay of some of the  information if theres a natural enemy for the rakshasas  any weaknesses where we can find them  matt okay you do know there is a very strong infernal hierarchy of all the hells  taliesin im also seeing what the book also specializes in  matt yes thats what it looks like as hes reading  its a very rigid power structure here and the whole purpose of most devils is to try and gain  power and ascend their rank by proving themselves stronger or  
none	 tearing others down to take their position  taliesin so anyone lower would be an enemy anyone higher would probably  matt well theyll work together because it is a lawful evil society it is a society that only  functions because of its structure  so it is tyrant and underlings and underlings will work and serve things they hate  that are more powerful in hope of gaining the favor especially since higher devils can bequeath  lower devils the chance to ascend to a higher tier  taliesin are there stories of anybody defeating a rakshasa before 
none	  matt you glance through and rakshasas like any other devil can be killed if you can go to it  and kill it but there are many tiers here there are archdevils at the top that are the rulers of  each essentially the top ranks there are greater devils below them greater devils include  horned devils erinyes which youve encountered pit fiends which youve encountered and ice  devils and they are the greatest of the devils below the archdevils then you have lesser devils  which are like imps spine devils bearded devils barbed devils chain 
none	 devils bone devils youve  got all these names you get some drawings and sketches of some of these creatures and they all  look awful lowest in this rank are lemures lemures are the souls of people that have passed  who have either done enough evil deeds that they fall under the sway of one of the archdevils most  of them are acquired by making a deal with a devil a contract theyre big into contracts  their power structure is based on what sort of souls what power they can gain what people they  can 
none	 sway what people they can convince to  taliesin lemures are infernal pokemon is basically what youre getting to  matt yeah once a soul has come under the sway of a devil and is brought to the nine hells it  either can become just a lost wandering soul used as a source of energy most of them convert into  lemures which are the lowlevel slaves theyre evertortured flesh masses that  taliesin so like the scream  matt yeah  theyre the tortured souls of the nine hells if a lemure does manage to do good enough 
town	  work over an extended period of time it can ascend into a lesser devil by pleasing its masters by  whatever it may be there is a chance thats how devils ascending are brought to a higher station  taliesin theres a few that have crawled their way up  matt yeah and the pit fiend you killed probably returned and got demoted  laura ooh to a lesser like they get turned into something smaller  matt if something really powerful and cool that was given a station was suddenly walking through  the street and killed by 
none	 a bunch of people in the city and came back and was like they killed me  theyd be like youre weak obviously reading the structure you probably really ruined that  guys day laughs  taliesin hes probably going to have centuries getting his shit back together hes probably  really pissed  matt yeah you basically made him lose his house and his dog and his wife you turned him into a  country song  taliesin do they talk about anything like the children that we saved  the effect of angelic angelic why those little angel 
none	 children  matt there is very little talk about celestial blood divas other than the fact that theres been  a longstanding battle since the founding since the prime gods and betrayer gods divided early in  the creation of exandria and  taliesin theres no talk about using celestial power as some sort of weapon  against these creatures  matt not celestial power necessarily but some of the entities are susceptible to various divine  magics and abilities and that is a strong back and forth between the two sides the big war is  between the devils 
none	 and the demons the abyss which is the nature of chaos and evil and driven  hunger at whatever cost versus the powerhungry devils which build structure dominance  expanding their territory and ruling through structure and power  taliesin okay so within evil there is chaos versus order is kind of the internal conflict of evil  matt yes those are the two sides devils versus demons  taliesin all right this is all very useful  matt but there are many tiers of the hells and nine  marisha does it mention any abyssal fiends that they particularly 
none	 hate  that we might have encountered  taliesin flipping im just going to keep skimming  liam while hes skimming could we jump back for just thirty seconds  matt sure  taliesin actually im happy to timepass and well revamp that  matt i just want to make sure that we dont get lost on this somewhere  liam just 30 seconds before we go in im like i should have the book ill carry the book in give  me the book  laura i thought you took the book  liam i dont carry books  
none	 laura no you have the book i thought you were lying to the guy  you actually have the book right  liam you took the book when we left  laura i didnt take the book i thought you took the book  liam are you fucking kidding me  laura are you fucking serious  liam fuck  taliesin can we direct people to the benny hill steampunk theme song  marisha sings yakety sax  laura lets go to the library  matt all right meanwhile  marisha so were we supposed to take the book or 
none	 were they supposed to take the book  taliesin i thought you said that we were taking the book  marisha well i also thought we were going to the reserve and now were in the library  matt are you unveiling the book  taliesin no we are not we have it we have not unveiled it  laura were heading to the library  matt okay  taliesin im going to keep reading while they head you guys if you want to  marisha im so confused on our plan  matt there are many things you learn 
none	 one the first layer of avernus which is the first layer  of the hell it is a terrible blackened rocky wasteland rivers of blood its a bad place  usually you have to travel from each layer into the next one there are very few portals thatll  lead to the hells usually any that do start at inverness and you have to work your way in that  area is ruled by zariel which is the archduchess of avernus this is also the realm of tiamat  taliesin ah yeah okay  matt you glancing through and trying 
dung	 to find things that catch your attention this is a large  tome you could spend days and days researching this but you dont have a lot of  time you are looking for specific things dis is the second layer of the nine hells it is a  labyrinth of canyons wedged between sheer mountains filled with iron ore there are iron  roads that span through the canyons with a series of bridges that lead over these giant crevasses  and this dark landscape the ruler of the second layer and the lord currently is dispater  travis 
none	 dispater  matt yes dispater which is  laura similar to james spader  liam yeah  all laugh  matt yeah just halfcousin talks kind of like him too its really creepy  marisha so its the realm of dis and the leader is  taliesin and marisha dispater  matt yeah  taliesin theyre not that clever  marisha and the first layer of hell is also referred to as the layer of inyimenemo what  matt avernus  marisha avernus  matt however what does catch your attention immediately is on dis there is a city called 
none	 the  iron city of dis that is a massive metropolis primarily where most extraplanar entities travel  to do business it is in many cases an open market  taliesin so probably safer  matt its one of the safer areas for a mortal to walk through comparatively its still in one of  the hells but because it is such a center for business its a popular location for extraplanar  travelers its a popular place for succubi incubi to travel its a popular place for  rakshasas it specifically brings up hags creatures that deal in business 
none	 deal in  exchanges deal in contracts beyond the usual devil ones a lot of them tend to go to the iron  city of dis  taliesin okay im marking that im putting a pin on my pinterest board  marisha atlas obscura that shit  taliesin atlas obscura the hell out of the city of dis  matt i can give you the rest of this to read on the break if youd like because its a lot of  information but thats the one that sticks out to you  taliesin i dont want to kill travis 
none	  matt no in looking specifically for the mention of rakshasas there are sections about the  creatures and talking about their history and how they originally stemmed from the hells and burst  out of the prime plane it goes into their history there the rest of it doesnt have as much in  correlation to where you would look for such a creature they do exist on  multiple layers of the hells  taliesin city of dis seems to be the winner  matt at the very least a place where you can get information that can 
none	 lead you elsewhere  taliesin im very excited  marisha any information on how to get there  laura and liam sing we built dis city on  taliesin interplanar travel  marisha i can plane shift there i do a very detailed look at what the  iron city of dis seems like  taliesin ill sketch a little bit of it out of the book as well  matt okay cool and there are some descriptors in there some mild sketches one thing it does  speak of is the tower the iron tower of dispater which is 
none	 essentially this massive central  structure to the city where the actual archdevil himself looks down upon the city and keeps watch  over most business that he can  liam great stealth roll  matt good job thank you  all laugh  taliesin dagger dagger  liam thank you  matt while you guys are completing your research taryon and grog  what are you guys doing  sam do you have the book  all laugh  travis which book  sam never mind lets go find a place to buy some potions  travis all right

none	 massive bearded goliath and  whatever the fuck doty is  sam hello hi greetings good day good afternoon dont mind them theyre my friends  hahahaha  travis wow  matt about five minutes of walking before two armored bastions come up in their piecemeal  leather and scale breastplate armor with their heavy fur cloaks over their shoulders holding  spears you  sam uh  matt you walk with strange company whats your business here in vasselheim  sam we are wandering merchants trying to find some textiles to buy to resell in other lands  thats 
none	 all dont mind my traveling companions theyre my protectors i travel as a merchant with  a lot of coin so i found these two at a leper colony and nursed them back to health it was also  a gym a muscleman place so theyre really buff but theyre also lepers and that explains their  matted hair  matt make a deception check please  taliesin you get to experience this as a normal person now im so excited  sam what deception  matt yeah  sam ooh i better use luck ooh no thats worse

none	 few words  matt he leans back and the two guards watch you and nod and step back  to let you continue to pass  sam thank you might i inquire from you fine gentleman where we might find some medicine or  healing potions these lepers are set to relapse that way all right ill head that way then good  day to you keep warm  matt as you guys keep walking they slowly close behind you and just begin to follow from about 30  feet back  travis that was amazing have you ever lied 
none	 to anybody before  sam never i think i have a talent for it though i just felt the words coming out and i went with it  travis it was a thrill right  sam it was thrilling it was exciting and they were going with it they were eating it up i had  them right where i wanted them i couldve told them fucking anything it was great right  travis yeah  sam wow  travis on a scale from one to two how do you think it went  sam i mean twos the higher

none	 i think theyre following us  travis really  sam what do we do  travis you know it was probably you told such a good story theyre just fascinated by you now  sam what do i do ive never been followed by guards before  travis you should probably act casual or you could drop some money on the ground and let all  the people run and collect it and make a diversion its up to you  sam are there people around  matt theres a few  travis just dump all your money on the 
none	 ground theyll come out of the houses the woodworks  sam i was warned about you and money i wont listen to that but i will try to act casual i  will just take off my gigantic diamondencrusted helmet let my hair down  travis how long is his long blonde hair  matt just past the shoulders  travis just freeflowing no fancy braids or buns or anything  matt no just freeflowing perfectly arced in the front except pulled back because of the  helmet its glorious its bee geetastic  sam loudly ah what a day

none	 doing well im learning a lot right now clearly you are a welltraveled  man of mystery  sam all right ive read about situations like this right we just need to create a diversion  while the guards are diverted we run away fast as we can right  travis i literally told you about that one minute ago  sam yes  all laugh  sam heres my plan  matt grog make a perception check  travis 15  matt youre getting close to the exterior of the building pointed to by the guards and you  
none	 recognize it its the place where youve previously purchased potions  travis look i hate to interrupt right do you think youve done anything wrong  sam illegal  travis yeah have you done anything wrong  sam i dont think so no  travis youve never been here before  sam well we are traveling around with an arcane being i dont know if thats illegal  travis yeah its totally fine look this place is where the goods are  sam you mean potions and magical items  travis all sorts of stuff i dont even know if

none	 you leave old twinkletoes  outside and we go in surely doty can read or something  sam he can stay here and keep watch but if they ask him anything he will be  travis mute  sam is that all right do you think  travis whats wrong with that  sam all right  travis maybe just tell him to be cool  sam doty  matt which as you turn you see hes been drawing in his book the entire time everything  you guys have been discussing  sam doty act cool that means book 
none	 down dont say a word and if the guards get close let us  know with some sort of sound thank you remember youre a leper so seem unhealthy  matt lopsided mechanical footsteps horrible creaking sounds  sam good all right lets go inside  travis yeah  matt so the guards are closing the gap a little bit you guys pick up pace they pick up pace a  little bit you get to the outside of the building the doors are closed you open them and  get inside the warm interior is lit up you can

none	 matt it does actually last time you were here it was in the process of being put together the  shop seems to be fully open now and outfitted though it doesnt seem to be getting much traffic  as it is very empy so he seems eager he has customers and now much more put at ease now that  youve let him know that from his vision the dragon woman did not come with you  travis yeah laughs you first  sam oh for myself do you have any spell scrolls or any sort of oneuse items 
none	 that i could  use in a fight or a tangle with some bad chaps  matt let me see what ive got  sam things that could deceive things that could use force against  matt and he rummages through a couple of scroll pieces lets see here what he might have i do  should you be so interested currently carry one scroll that would surround with you a wreath of  dangerous fire  sam oh all right just around me or around an area  matt just around you anything that came too close would burst 
dung	 into flames and be burned  sam i have 13 of those right here do you have anything else  travis not that thats not really impressive  sam its really good  matt ive got something that makes you jump  sam ive got that  matt ive got something that makes you see in the dark  sam yeah i have a light already  all laugh  matt what do you want  sam all right give me that one scroll the fire scroll i could sell it and get something else  matt all right  
none	 sam how much is that  matt im looking right now for the scroll thats here  travis you have to read the scroll right  sam i could read it to you if thats what youre asking  matt he looks you over the scroll i would put at a fair 6000 gold pieces  sam gulps watch how its done im going to put an amount of gold on the table id like you to  consider it and if its to your liking take it and if not just shake your head and ill put 200  
none	 gold on the table ill put 200 more ill put 2000 more and another 2000  matt make a persuasion check  travis 4400  sam 17 plus seven 24  matt takes the gold  travis wow  sam check and mate  travis checknmate  matt you now have a scroll of fire shield  sam scroll of fire shield excellent i dont know what that is  travis wow do you have anything that makes you faster  matt i said i have something that makes you jump  travis no im pretty good at jumping what 
none	 about regular healing potions  matt that ive got you cleared me out of my other various vials last time  travis no new exotics came in  matt no im waiting on trades been a little slow looks like things are getting up in emon so  hopefully well have more soon but for the time being i do have some more healing potions and  he goes into the back room and you hear him rummaging for a minute you hear one crate fall  over and a couple of things shatter ah god damn and eventually he 
none	 comes back through the  door and hes holding in his arms a few clusters of various glass vials some of them have been  repurposed and taped at the top but theyre functional he sets them down on the counter all  right i have six potions of healing and i have three of greater healing and one superior  sam do i know how much these things tend to cost  matt make an intelligence check  sam ooh this is not a save  matt yes just add your modifier  sam 20  matt yes actually 
none	 the healing potions can range around 75 to 100 gold pieces generally  the uncommon ones can range somewhere in the 500 gold pieces range the superior however are much  rarer to come by and the fact he even has one with how recently you guys cleared him out its  pretty decent that one can run anywhere between 40005000 gold pieces  sam and its six three and one is that right  matt six three and one  travis do you want to get them it seems like you got all the money in the world  
none	 sam i can heal myself just fine but i dont know about your friends  do they have healing abilities  travis no not well they do they touch you with their hand and then like all of a sudden it  feels a bit better  sam a bit better  travis yeah i dont really know how that works  sam but they use potions ive seen them use potions  travis yeah im normally pouring them in their mouths  sam do you think they would appreciate these  travis i dont know i hadnt thought that 
none	 far as a mumbling new member of vox machina  sam what was that  travis bad allergies here it could be like a really great gift you know  like keyleth gave you  sam  welcomemetothegang gift  travis yeah  sam do you giftwrap here sir  matt for an additional charge yes of course i gift wrap  sam  of course for an additional charge what if we took the whole lot of those for 6000 gold  matt the whole lot for 6000 im afraid that is far under the price id be considering 
none	 let me  see here and he does some kind of notations and he goes hm you seem from our previous  experience to be quite the bargainer my friend  travis yeah the brains  matt how would you say to the fair price of 10000 gold pieces for the batch  travis let me confer with my partner whispers how many on your hands is that yeah no both  hands how many  sam all  travis two  sam oh wait  all laugh  sam its too much  travis too much  sam yes 
none	 this man is insulting your intelligence and you should be very angry right now  travis how about 9000 gold pieces  matt mm you drive a very hard bargain my big friend however because its you deal  travis done pay the man  sam i would object to this this is coming out of my purse and i insist that you negotiate with me  and not  travis tary this man drives a really wellknown establishment if we leave here after having  struck that bargain and we dont pay there will be more guards outside  
none	 sam gulps how about this i can trade you something worth far more than the extra 3000 gold  this gentleman promised you  matt what would this be  sam its a rare egg magical in nature it can save a life in any situation and if you eat it  when you are nearly dead you will go back into battle with the strength and bravery of ten men  and you will not rest until your foes are dead  matt make a persuasion check this isnt deception because you believe this  wholeheartedly  sam is 
none	 this deception or persuasion  matt this is persuasion  sam 22  matt 6000 and the egg you say very well he pushes the  sam gentle  matt i will be he goes over and quickly reaches over and grabs a thick towellike pile of  cloth and wraps it up carefully ooh sets it down a pleasure doing business with you all  sam ahahah the giftwrapping  all laugh  matt terribly sorry my apologies ill be right to it and he turns and leaves the room  travis tary that was a personal gift from

none	 the other not met with any living person for the most part in your journey  you both approach still arms hooked  liam no  matt okay  liam i suspect youve been here before  taliesin yes  liam sighs i like that things are better between you and i now  taliesin i feel the same i like that most things are better now not everything but its a  brighter world even for us  liam do you know what i like i like the version of you that my sister brings out  taliesin i

dung	 long black gowns with dark veils that drift over their head to the  mid torso that you had lead you into the chamber initially both suddenly present themselves bow  and step out of the side as the chamber doors open to the interior of the ravens crest temple  there standing as the doors open is what looks to be an older woman wearing the same attire the  same dark veil somewhat able to see her features beneath the dark material that hangs in front of  her she steps forward as the doors open  liam 
none	 hello there you recognize me this is my friend we bring you an offering for the queen  matt the woman bends down takes the tome from your hand she holds it she takes her fingers and  brushes the cloth away that currently obscures the tome takes a look at it holds it a foot further  away from her face and throws the cloth over the front clasps it in her arms and brings it down  towards her torso and for the first time since this youve heard her speak before you have  done this before 
none	 but the strange eerie kind of airy whisper comes out from this older woman as  she bends forward clutching this tome we thank you and we will be sure that this finds its final seal  liam she has begun to speak to me her desires are not clear entirely but i am listening and i  intend to learn  matt good  liam we have to go but i mean to come back  matt whenever youre ready the vision of the gods is obscured beyond the divine gate we are  not just their tools but 
none	 their extensions the creations that act as their fingers in this plane  the center of all other life and death be watchful be vigilant she bows and backs into  the ravens crest once more as the doors close the two other women now flanking out of the  shadows and stepping before each door and seemingly just  not paying attention to your presence  taliesin i was envious of you once god so sorry sighs  liam whispers good day  matt they make no response as you guys turn and make your way  down the 
tavern	 stairs from the ravens crest  taliesin just so you know it is your duty to have some joy in the meantime you do know that  right youre no use to her a wreck she needs a man have a fucking beer and i slap him on the  ass as we walk towards the pub  liam look over my shoulder at the temple as we walk come on lets get drunk  matt as your head moves forward walking you feel this cold tingle just drift down the back of your  neck and spine then it 
tavern	 fades and you keep walking carrying on your chest there a brief  warm secondary heartbeat representing the brief boon granted upon you by the raven queen you  catch up with the ladies at the bar  marisha hey  laura and sam laugh  taliesin i shove keyleth at him fix that good god  liam laughs  taliesin ahh  liam scoop and lift  marisha are you broken again  liam no  marisha ah  liam i need a drink have you had one already  marisha yes  liam im fine  laura shes

none	 or was it just keyleth and vax  marisha it was just vax and allura  matt yeah vax allura thats right  taliesin ooh  marisha whom we kind of forgot was with us nervous laugh  matt thats right and she was like whatever  marisha yeah  matt all right so you guys all emerge and you see now on these extremely tall mountain bluffs  the wind is strong on the outskirts and you can see whizzing past you puffs of cloud and leaf  and dust but its all contained on the outside of this 
town	 bluff and before you on the opposite side  built deep into this mountain top you can see dozens and dozens of structures made from the  natural stone and bending of long wood slats that seem to have been curved over into these domelike  structures you see small trees emerging in places and even though you are a few hundred feet  off you can already see maybe 20 or so various people just wandering the town some of which are  outside working on sitting on benches working on various crafts you can see leathers being dried 
none	  out from various hides you catch the sight of a griffin that swoops past and disappears into a  nearby cloud and looking over the bluff  sam cool  matt  about ten feet off this is the drop goes down for hundreds of feet before vanishing into  lowhanging clouds you guys have no idea how high up you are but it seems very high  marisha inhales oh man  sam are we falling  laura is it super windy  marisha no no no were on the mountain  matt you can see a lot 
none	 of wind rushing just around you but it seems like this portion of the  mountain is almost protected or at least the winds are guided in a way where theyre not  affecting this portion of the mountain  laura so what do we do  liam what happens now boss  marisha i forgot you guys havent seen my hometown yet okay all right lets go that way  okay see over there is where i caught my first baby griffin  taliesin oh no  marisha  he was lost and got separated from his mom and

none	 really good  laura yeah  liam yeah i feel really good i feel rested i feel fucking healthy man i dont know im  serious  laura all right thats happy  liam growls  laura growls  matt as you guys are walking closer to the outside of zephra you see a couple of individuals  beginning to approach three or four children just seeing these strange visitors in the  outskirts theyre also keeping low and not trying to draw your attention too strongly though they  are out in the middle of the open you see 
none	 a few bushes and elements you see two grown individuals  walking up with the children one of which appears to be a relatively young girl maybe around 13 14  years old who pushes the kids to the back and goes keyleth  marisha yes hi hi whats your name  matt sora you used to watch over me when i was little  marisha oh my goodness sora wow last time i saw you you were like like oh man look how big  youve gotten  matt i  marisha do you still know that handshake do 
none	 you remember the  matt it takes a moment for you guys to figure it out  marisha and there youve got it you got it  matt its slightly awkward but for the most part you recall it  marisha yeah yeah  matt im much older now i dont need to  marisha oh man  matt i didnt  marisha you forgot  matt youre back  marisha yeah i guess i am  matt we have to tell everyone else  marisha hey hey  matt the kids are all just quietly staring wideeyed and smiling 
none	 quietly  marisha sora sora have you seen my dad around  matt do you want me to get him  marisha yeah  matt okay  marisha okay  matt cmon cmon kids and takes them by the hand and they all drag the kids off as you guys  wait in the outskirts of the city one of the kids who didnt quite get a hand on this young  threeyearold boy whos running behind them stops turns and stares at you all but stares  specifically at grog and is just wideeyed going  travis hey  
town	 matt hi  travis eat your vegetables youll look like this  matt okay  travis now get out of here  matt yells  all laugh  matt just immediately bolts past to catch up with the rest of the crowd  taliesin so i believe you just set up a lifetime of unreasonable expectations  travis hell be healthy though  laura ive never seen grog eat a single vegetable  travis no fuck those things  laura  the entire time ive known him  taliesin i was wondering about that  travis nothing in green is 
none	 good  matt a short time passes a few moments before you begin to see the city suddenly come to more  vibrant life people are stepping out of their abodes dozens of individuals are beginning to  come together talking whispering and some looking back and watching you all in the outskirts  of zephra until eventually it seems a procession of some kind is all gathering and moving out of  this mass of people in your direction as you look you begin to see people adorned in similar  clothing as to when you first encountered keyleth 
none	 in the swamps outside of stillben you see these  leatherbased almost scaledlooking armor that drifts down to the legs you see people that hold  giant staffs that hold golds and greens and blue colors that mark the symbols of the zephra tribe  and then in the center of them youve met once before you see stepping forth korren the father  of keyleth and the current acting voice of tempest of the zephra his long white silver hair  drifting behind him he approaches with a look everyone holds back as he steps forth from the  
town	 crowd and ignoring the rest of you just goes and beelines straight to keyleth you can see him he  has a bit of a limp to him that you dont recall from last time but he seems other than that in  good health as he approaches you he clasps his hands out in front of him and takes a good long  look at you as he reaches out and takes your hands into his own my daughter  marisha i just drop to a knee and say kaitiyaki father  matt kaitiyaki keyleth weve heard that the 
none	 defense of emon was successful yes  marisha yes we have defeated the chroma conclave the help of vox machina and many many  others at the cost of many lives  matt good good im glad we could be of some aid to your journey  marisha yes thank you the air ashari were very valuable during that day very courageous  matt and we will remember those we lost in that fray the great sacrifices that they gave so that  these children could live so and at this point he now takes notice of the rest of 
none	 the group by  what joy do we have of bringing your allies here and returning to your people  laura he doesnt know  marisha sorry i thought uvenda might have said something im here because i have completed my  aramente and have come for my blessing  matt yes you have  laura gasps  matt i just wanted to hear it from your lips  marisha still waiting on your final word i guess  matt well while we still have daylight let us prepare for the ceremony come come all of you  you are 
none	 welcome welcome here in zephra well begin decoration shall commence rest prepare  naught but two or three hours until the ceremony is to occur he turns and folks begin to rush  in and people just begin to barrage you with questions and congratulations and a number of  individuals who seem to have heard stories many secondhand and exaggerations of the various  things that youve accomplished over the past year or so here in taldorei you answer questions you  play into the tall tales if you want one child turns to you and goes and who 
none	 are you  sam taryon darrington  matt i dont know who you are  sam you will  matt you  all laugh  matt there is a massive interest around grog as goliaths generally do not travel this far up into  the territory of the mountain most of them stay far north in the cliffkeep or wandering the  dividing plain theyre just swarming you and climbing up on you and hanging from your arms and  you feel kind of awkward but kind of enjoying the attention at the same time  travis theyre really little 
none	  laura kind of like gnomes  travis yeah gasps  all laugh  taliesin well that works well done  travis im good  matt immediately over the next hour or two people begin to gather floral wreaths and strips  of silk and material that have been prepared specifically for these types of occasions many of  them new made from the recent generations in preparation many that are held over by tradition  and by the various leaders that came before you many that may have had the hope of the return of  vilya but instead 
none	 carry through with memory of keyleth as this transpires you guys are brought  food you are gathered into a central open celebration almost like a pit that descends about  two feet and there are a number of stools and tables and food and drink are brought about as  opposed to an event and then a celebration afterward it seems to be a reverse here at  zephra its a buildup its everyone the excitement grows as this is happening you glance  off and there is one very large singular tree right across the way at the 
none	 very edge of the  precipice of this rocky outcropping that holds most of the city of zephra and there at the edge  you see one large twisting gnarled tree that curves upward not quite sun tree in height and  size but still very elegant and beautiful with long thin branches that gently sway on the  outskirts of whatever barrier seems to bend and twist the winds from coming and scattering the  village you watch as people step up to it and theyre leaving jewelry theyre putting large  ribbons across it elements of it remind 
dung	 you of the tree that was in the center of the temple in  vesrah though a different texture it seems to be a deep vibrant healthy dark brown and with  elements of gray bark with moss that grow at the base and tuck under the branches where the  shadows tend to linger throughout the day eventually it seems that they have returned and  the decor is set benches have been moved and most of the people of zephra are now shifting in  the direction of this tree  liam in all the hubbub and the 
none	 movement a few moments before ive been watching for korren and  when i see him alone for a second i make a beeline toward him  matt hes in the process of a conversation and its interesting during this whole thing he was  excited to see you and that youve come but hes also hes kept a strange distance from you  during this preparation he smiles and you guys meet eyes occasionally but hes also just  focusing on this endeavor and then you kind of come out of the blue ah yes vaxildan  liam forgive 
none	 me might i have just a moment  matt quickly were about to begin but yes  liam i will be brief i just wanted to take a moment to say i really wish you couldve seen  some of the things she has done i know you are proud of her ive never met anyone like her  shes going to do your people very proud im grateful  matt as are we all  liam youve a lot to do  matt as do you as does she and he reaches out and pats you on the head 
none	 and ruffles your hair a  little bit and even that feels a little awkward for him like he felt impulsive to do it and then  oh that wasnt very mm  liam its all right its more than i ever got  taliesin whoa ow  sam darkness  matt anyway come its nearly time and as all of you are led over there are spaces at the very  front of the ceremony in the semicircle around this tree there are platforms set up at the base  of this tree now amongst these hundreds of various 
none	 dangling threads these small pieces of  paper that flitter on the outskirts of the gentle wind that pushes through you guess they might  contain wishes or passages or something but you see bits of script written on them amongst the  various glinting pieces of glass and gems and stone that have been polished its small but beautiful  eventually youre led to sit in the center of this semicircle and as everyone gathers and takes  their seat you hear the occasional kid crying and people muttering to themself and eventually  everyone shushes as korren now 
none	 wearing a very old ceremonial long light blue and white robe  wearing what looks to be some sort of a somewhat tattered like a scarf thats wrapped around his  neck and drapes off each of his arms its thick and its long and it almost touches the ground around  him but you can tell from the way he holds it and  his arms consistently rest at this crooked position  that it has some symbolism to this ceremony as he steps up under the tree and turns around  everyone gets very quiet and the wind 
none	 seems to almost stop on the outside of this barrier  the rushing perpetual gust of air seems to almost hold its breath for this he  clears his throat and as he looks up to everyone you swear this tree begins to slowly produce  cherry blossoms as his words continue for long we of the winds have awaited the procession of our  tradition with the passing of our elder voice dwala it was my wife vilya who was selected to  take the aramente beautiful and full of determination she accepted her path and while  she 
none	 did not return to us the destiny she set is now seen as one of preparation her journey was  not in vain for it was her love that produced our daughter it was her guidance in joy that taught  our child compassion it was her discipline and understanding that forged young keyleths spark of  intuition and unlocked her adept connection with nature and the winds we mourn the loss of our  vilya but take pride that she lives on in the eyes of our own returned beloved woman of the  winds here we bring together 
dung	 our collective voices to bless upon my daughter the memory of  vilya the champion of guasar the mantle of our destiny and as he puts his arms up from around  you to each side keyleth you watch as young acolytes begin to approach from each side arms  down all seemingly carrying these various pieces of dark green leatherlike material and as they  come together they latch them into place and slowly build this mantle ring clear our voices  to unite our breath and grant our strength to her guidance and wisdom as keyleth takes the 
none	 rightful  and earned responsibility of leading our people into this next generation at this point the  assembled mantle is placed into korrens arms and you now see this beautiful neck and shoulder piece  that rests past to the elbows but limp and without body in his hands as he holds it there and the  rest of the acolytes step back and find their place seated he lifts his arms up a bit and  begins to just sing a singular note sings and everyone around you in zephra begins to join in in  this singular 
none	 note do you choose to join in as well  travis yeah  laura sure  matt as you do the notes begin to separate and harmonize instinctually it creates this symphony  this beautiful tangling of hundreds of voices from all across the spectrum and what at first may  seem to resemble a discordant hymn finds this perfect spread of every note youve ever heard  musically merging as one as he does this instinctually keyleth without even thinking you  rise and begin to walk towards him like the spirits of generations before you are lifting you 
none	  by your shoulders and elbows and bring you up before your father you find the breath leave your  lungs the inside of your mouth is dry  marisha yeah  matt youre unable to understand what it is thats driving you but before you know it youre  standing before your father looking up into his eyes as all of these voices just swirl around you  this weird warmth the nerves in your stomach still climb to the top and vibrate within your  chest as your father places this mantle over your head and shoulders and 
none	 it comes to rest on you  heavier than you expected but it fits well as he places this the green fades to a golden brown and  red and orange and yellow and the green leaves almost drip back into a long springing trail of a  cloak behind you that seems to grow with each passing surge of these voices around her until it  reaches the ground and curls behind eventually the cloak stops the voices soften and  come to silence as you look up once more into your fathers face rise my daughter and become 
town	  keyleth voice of the tempest he steps back and bows his head steps off the platform and you  stand and turn and its just you at the base of tree looking about at all of zephra before you  quiet silent and your friends before you at the front of the crowd  marisha didnt think id make it here i couldnt have done any of this without not only the support  of every person in zephra and every person of the ashari tribe members of emon taldorei marquet  even wildmount in my journeys ive learned 
none	 being a leader is a global effort one that takes the  wisdom of many most importantly i couldnt have done any of this without vox machina and the  pieces of them that ive taken away and have desperately tried to emulate in each one of them  over the years each one of them with qualities that i admire and strive to embrace grog with  his strength and his unyielding loyalty vex with her selfconfidence and utter fearlessness vax is  one of the most compassionate people i think ive ever come across and one of the 
none	 most brave even  if its maybe foolish percival with your intelligence and your sensibility is always there  to be my balance scanlan with his charisma and his wit pike  matt as you glance past the group you can see just the faint flutter of golden light and energy  wherever she is a part of her is watching  marisha pike her generosity and her authenticity always true to herself and even  tary taryon darrington whose blind faith in vox machina and perseverance trusted us even though  he probably shouldnt have  sam whispers youre 
none	 incredible  marisha all of these things that i learned and couldnt be a leader without vox machina makes up  me zephra makes up me the ashari people and all of greater exandria i dont know if im the  leader that you deserve or a good leader but im willing to dedicate the rest of my life to doing  whatever i can for all of us as long as vox machina stands by my side  matt at this point you watch as the light that remains of the eventually soontocome setting sun  glints across the 
dung	 cheek of keyleth the bit of damp tear that has rolled down her cheek just  detaches from the edge of her chin and hits the bottom of the stone every cherry blossom in the  tree releases and drifts past her from behind before getting caught up in the wind just past  her causing this swirl of pinks and reds and whites behind her everyone around rises up and  they all begin to cheer and clap all together you look around and watch the rest of these  blossoms slowly drift you look and see your friends 
none	 around you you look around and you see  your mother out of the corner of your eye just the memory of her you sense that if she could be  here she wouldve been your father steps up and takes your hands and just says im so proud of  you and theres much to be done i know but im proud of you and he takes your hand and holds  it up once more to the voice of the tempest and the future of our people everyone cheers once  more together  sam to vox tempesta 
none	  all laugh  matt and with that you gain the inspiring leader feat  marisha what i get the what now  matt inspiring leader feat as the end of your aramente  travis oh shit voice of the tempest  matt which is pretty fun what that allows you to do is  travis you can never die  matt no you can totally die you can spend ten minutes inspiring your companions shoring up  their resolve to fight when you do so choose up to six friendly creatures which can include  yourself within 30 feet 
none	 that can hear and understand you each creature can gain temporary  hit points equal to your level plus your charisma modifier  marisha oh what well you guys are out of luck with the charisma modifier shit but what  all laugh  matt and they can only gain the temporary hit points from this until they finish a short or long  rest so every short rest you can give everyone 17 temporary hit points  marisha that is fucking dope  sam you have to give a speech every time  matt essentially you take ten minutes
