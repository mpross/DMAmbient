mighty nein had found their way south outside  of the empire on the coast of the menagerie coast stolen a pirate ship apparently following a  thread to pursue aspects of the mystery of fjords background and the relationship to his mysterious  patron followed a mostly charred map to an island known as urukaxl passing the dangerous reefs you  came upon the mother ship to the ship /none/ that you had stolen known as the squalleater which was then  you realized helmed by captain avantika who gave you the option of either working with her under  her guise as essentially currently captives and maybe eventually crewmen of the ship or be killed  and left in the harbor held down with rocks and die you took her up on the offer you also  discovered that she seems to be as enthralled with this same entity as fjord is and has some sort of  similar history with how this serpentine entity known as  travis /none/ ukotoa  matt ukotoa you remembered good job  laura and sam whispering ukotoa  matt ukotoa once a creation of zehir the cloaked serpent god now banished since the  calamity this entity then began to build its own following and the followers of zehir this old  god this once creator grew jealous and sealed it away now avantika with your help is working to  begin to release these seals bring it back and as such gain the blessings and boons of this  entity you decided to go into the jungle with her on this mission /town/ alongside an adventurer a  dungeoneer who had plotted out some of the path for you named jamedi you had made your way  through avoiding hunting parties of lizard men being hunted by yuanti snake people you made  your way towards a mostly stonecrafted village in the center of this island that surrounded one  large old temple you snuck in masquerading as some of these snake people and mostly succeeded  managed to sneak your way through part of the town gathering some attention you threw up some  distracting illusions you quickly killed off a few /none/ of them that had begun to grow wise to your  presence not being naturally wanted and in the midst of the commotion you raced up the steps of  the temple managed to kick one of the sentries off the side found a way through the top and  closed it off locking behind the very top of this fivesided pyramid now once inside you began to  descend slowly down the curved stairs but in missing a trap that was present triggered it the  stairs went smooth and the entire party slid down this slide gooniesstyle before /none/ impacting into  the ground of one of the top chambers of the pyramid looking within the interior of this  fivesided chamber you noticed amongst the two pillars to the side a raised platform where there  was a fountain of some kind surrounded by three of these mostly humanoid but  snakescalecoveredinplaces yuanti people and one with gray armored scaly skin mostly human  body though tall and lanky and a head that was purely cobralike the hood exposed as all of them  turn to your direction as you impact with the stone and are made aware /none/ of your presence with  that mighty nein i would like for you to roll initiative  exclamations  liam do i get any jump on that slow spell i tossed out at the last second of the episode  yeah i said i start casting slow and you said thats where well pick up next week  matt yes you will and thatll be your turn because literally its not so much a stand you  just slid down and hit the ground and you just take a moment to take in the scenario and then now  we /none/ get to be  liam had to ask  matt no worries  taliesin deep in the single digits over here  laura ooh  marisha deep in the single digits  laura its a cleric thing  taliesin this is a cleric thing  travis hey max can i get ashleys ipad  matt good call all righty 25 to

six here comes that slow spell fastball special  taliesin the windup  liam mmhmm  matt i believe thats all of us beginning now this round of combat beau you have the jump  everyone is prone by the way you slid down the /none/ stairs on your ass and impacted with the stone  floor of this chamber nott what would you like to sorry beau is sorry beau  marisha these are lizard people or these are snake people  matt yeah these are  marisha these are the yuanti  matt yes these are the yuanti these three individuals that are mostly humanoid but bits of  their skin are scaled their eyes are yellow you can see sharpened teeth this individual here is  the one with the large hooded snake head thats still a bit taller than the rest and /none/ these long  lanky arms gray skin  marisha do they look super pissed off  matt they look very unhappy that youve stumbled into this chamber  marisha okay thats all i need to know  sam im just going to say this as players last time we encountered a group of people we killed  them all they hadnt done anything to us im just saying  marisha yeah  laura these people obviously skin other people alive okay theyre bad people  taliesin these are indiana jones and the temple of doom villains  marisha okay im /none/ going to get up  sam okay kill them all  matt beau comes to her feet thats half your movement  marisha okay im going to go for that hooded one if i can ive got 25 do i round down because  its 45 halved  matt its halved that almost all numbers in the game are rounded down so to 20  marisha so 20 foint 20 foint of movemoint  liam what just happened  matt i dont know if you have enough room or enough distance to get over here youd have to  go /none/ over either way youre going to take some attacks of opportunity so its up to you  marisha okay so ill just go for these two right there in the corner  matt you jump onto your feet and leap up onto the top and youre now pincered from both at  different angles what are you going to do  marisha i say we come in peace i cant even then i throw a punch im going to see if i can  hit the one to my right first  matt okay go for it  marisha that /none/ was almost great 12 nope 15  matt 15 hits  marisha im going to punch with my fist which is good nine  all nein  marisha im going to spend a ki point to stun  matt its nine damage  marisha stunning strike  matt thats a natural 18 plus zero  marisha bullshit  matt it does make the save  marisha i will punch the other one  matt go for it  marisha sorry 13  matt 13 does hit theyre not wearing much in armor theyre here for ceremonial reasons  marisha eight /none/ points of damage  matt eight points of damage to the other one so both been hit  sam i dont know sure sounded like we were being shamed theyre not wearing any weapons theyre  just here for ceremonial reasons  matt i mean theyre not armored they have weapons on them these particular ones the  purebloods you see here as they are called are not wearing heavy armor so theyre not too  difficult to hit  marisha im going to spend a ki point again and do flurry of blows  matt all right go for /none/ it you got two more attacks then  marisha then im going to punch each one of them again  travis and matt do it  marisha that was almost a natural 20 did you see that 15 thats good ten  matt ten points of damage to the one on the left  laura i like those dice  marisha oh thank you i dont remember where these came from  marisha the other one was a natural 16 they take another ten points of damage  matt nice all righty you went whack whack manage to hit them /none/ both repeatedly in a row all  attacks hit theyre both taken aback by the impact and then spin to you immediately their  tongues out theyre definitely focused on your presence now  marisha probably should have done patient defense but im done  matt now youre done yashas go next  travis yashas going to pop up  matt all right yasha gets to her feet  travis shes there does she have half of her speed left  matt correct  travis 20 feet can she get up onto the platform opposite of beau how much further /none/ can she go can  she get to hooded snake cobra kai  matt not right now that path is blocked unfortunately  laura but shes flanking she gets advantage on her attacks  travis which one is she flanking this one in between beau and i  matt yeah currently  travis yeah with her bonus action she would like to rage  matt yes the rage kicks in pulls out her magicians judge sword and  travis yeah with the magicians judge could she make her first of two attacks against that one  that shes flanking and /none/ could she make them reckless  matt certainly i mean shes flanked but she can  travis oh yeah so its already there right  matt yeah  travis i aint scared and neither is yasha shell use divine fury if it hits  matt roll for the attack with advantage because you have her flanked  travis thats good 18  matt 18 hits so damage on that one  music  travis 12 plus five 17 on the first one  matt nice jumps off of the side and with the momentum she leaps onto the platform she /none/ pulls  her sword out arcs it past the already punched damaged yuanti in front reacts looks over the  shoulder towards you as you go for your second attack same one  travis yes please natural 20 with that barbarian critical double the dice counting  thats 17 points of damage on the second one  matt 17 points of damage  travis yes  matt okay then  travis not a lot they were low  matt on the same one right  travis yes  matt with the second strike the first one carves past it hisses /none/ at her yasha then spins  the sword around and with one giant snap the head plop and the body falls off to the side of the ground  and crumbles  laura easy kill oh no  taliesin it means they hurt  travis yasha winks at beau  matt okay rage winks  travis yeah growls  matt that finishes yashas go  liam heads off that corpse you cant put it back  taliesin a lot of things it means that they could actually do damage to us possibly they  could be glass cannons  laura /none/ oh right thats true well find out  taliesin were probably about to find out  laura hes thinking  sam that one uses her turn to cry  laura fake crying my sister  liam triplets down to twins  matt that one is going to look towards you beau and in this soft pinched voice go why dont you  just go sit down make a wisdom saving throw for me as this brief sparkle happens in your eyes you  feel this wave of arcane influence begin to reach out towards your mind  marisha 18  /none/ matt you blink it off and smile back  marisha theres not chairs what  sam i think they have a lisp  matt the other one is going to moving off to this end attempt to pull out a scimitar and aim  down to strike at an angle towards nott whos currently on the ground  sam im just a snake person  travis i dont know if she was in melee with yasha  matt yeah she is shes within melee  travis ill use that sentinel reaction  matt so she gets an attack  travis /none/ thats reckless 18  matt that definitely hits  liam you can quit barbarians any time you want  travis counting 15 points of damage  matt nice yashas seeing this one slink by and swing with the scimitar down towards nott whos  trying to scramble away down on the ground yasha turns around and slams the blade into the back of  her shoulder forcing her down however the scimitar is already arcing down towards nott with  advantage because you are on the ground all right a 15 and a 16 i believe thats a total of /dung/  19 to hit  sam that hits  matt the strike hits you for seven points of slashing damage  sam uncanny dodge so whats that four  matt three  travis you look like that two year old that got into the face paint how do i look daddy  marisha moms really expensive makeup  travis im a ninja turtle  laura your work was far better than mine  taliesin no i was following your lead  matt now the tall lanky gray one begins to take a step forward and slither around in this direction /none/  slithering  travis those sounds are just awful oh shit he got some movement  matt 30 over the top down the legs as they bend seem to give in places they shouldnt with an  unnatural slithery feel to even just the footsteps its really creepy to watch it move as  it spins around its going to attempt to take a bite and scimitar attack both on beau with  advantage because its flanking with its own pureblood thatll be a 24 to hit  marisha uhhuh he knew he didnt have to ask  liam tell /none/ me when the nein stops screaming clarice  matt bite attack so you take four points of piercing damage plus nine points of poison damage  travis nein ill do it  matt as part of its mind fang ability youre also going to take some psychic damage  travis psychic also  matt oh thats not good  nervous laughter  liam things you never want to hear matt say  matt 22 points of psychic damage  marisha your dm and your doctor thats not good  matt as the hood opens and the giant fangs extend and /none/ sink into the back of your shoulder the  poison hits your system and your brain suddenly pulses with a sharpening pain the psychic energy  courses through the entirety of your consciousness for a second your vision goes  flash white and blurs you almost fall to one knee as the fangs pull out of the wound at that  moment its going to strike with its scimitar  laura oh my god it gets another oh this guys really hard  matt thats 23 to hit  sam oh man do some monk shit  marisha i should /none/ have i made a wrong call  matt seven points of slashing damage  marisha okay im still alive  matt all right thats going to end its turn  taliesin are you in the single digits or double  marisha double but barely  matt all right that brings us to fjords turn  travis oh yeah ill pop up cool all right yeah cool cool cool okay hot second yeah  that changed what i was thinking  laura fjord dont do it stop it  travis you know what i dont want to get in there can /none/ i just mm yeah boy  marisha did we ever do any of that poison resist stuff we fell down the stairs right  laura singing we didnt do it we didnt have time  travis you know what where i am im going to fire two blasts of eldritch blast at it and im  going to close  matt to which one  travis at cobra kai  matt okay go for it  travis you know what with my bonus action no just eldritch blast 16  matt that hits  travis ooh good ooh 15  /dung/ matt 15 still hits  travis all right oh its an eight 12 points of damage total  sam looking really rough  matt no as it pulls back from beau and swings with its scimitar the head curves back and stares  at you you can see against this dark gray scaly skin its very dull yellowwhite eyes immediately  trace onto you is that the end of your turn are you going to move or stay where youre at you  have 15 more feet of movement  travis can i move along the wall that way  /none/ matt counting 15 its as far as you can get  travis thatll be fine  matt that finishes your go fjord nott youre up  sam screams nott will from prone fire a shot at actually will load a burning bolt i have  one left and fire it at snake creature the hooded one okay ooh yeah 22  matt that definitely hits its sneak attack because its adjacent to beau plus the additional  damage from a fire bolt  sam ooh yes counting 26 plus ill use fury of the small why not 31 plus the /none/ burning bolt  what does that do  matt it should be on your sheet there i think its an additional 1d6 fire damage if i recall  sam i didnt write it wait no it says 1d6 fire damage another two points  travis yeah metal  matt it hisses as the bolt hits it from the back of the head and you can see where it embedded  itself partially into the skull it comes up at top and part of the bones piercing up and the  flames are still burning in the back its trying to /none/ reach and pull it out of its own head all  right thats your action  laura how did it shoot through the head and its still alive  sam its got that snake hood thats very thin i assume i dont know  matt it didnt go all the way through the brain it just hooks into it it did some serious damage still  sam i dont know how hiding works but im going to hide i know that this thing over here will see  me but can i hide right there hiding from the vision of /none/ that one does that work can you hide  from one person  matt well youre still prone if you want to get up its half your movement or you can crawl at  half speed  sam im going to crawl over there and hide  matt you crawl over here you can go there because youre still in melee with that one but  you can attempt to hide from the other if youd like  sam im going to hide  taliesin prone still means youre disadvantage no they have advantage  matt its advantage on melee /none/ attacks against you disadvantage on ranged attacks against you you  crawl on the ground around the corner roll a stealth check  sam 23 but i think because im wearing the hood or whatever  matt yeah you always get advantage while you have that cloak on  sam okay still 23  matt you believe maybe youve hidden from that one particular creature that finishes notts go  breaking the silence here beau after youve been struck by this terrible psychic pain in your face  and the poison courses through your veins you look before you and /none/ the one yuanti pureblood in  front of you you had already damaged is snarling and its pulling this crooked dagger  out of this sheath from the side suddenly in a flash out of nowhere behind you see blades go  wooshing and you watch as avantika who was previously invisible still from the spell appears  as she does three main strikes from behind  travis three  matt two with the rapier first one hits second one still hits and the dagger hits all righty  counting  sam ooh i did my math wrong  travis /none/ as soon as you attack it drops your invisibility right  matt thatll do it eviscerates it from behind screeches falls to the ground avantika is there  in front of you and flicks both blades off some of the blood splashing across the stone on the  ground dont worry ive got you and is going to use movement to move up this way actually she  doesnt have enough movement to do that she can be right there and gets one more space there that  ends avantikas go  sam not that it matters fury of the /none/ small is six points of damage so it would have been 34 points  of damage  matt one more point thank you for the clarification on your math there sam jamedis  going to get up  marisha moms jamedi  travis first opportunity  matt makes me sad good patience on that one jamedis going to start taking the bow and huffing  and running around the way to hide behind this pillar coming that way is going to attempt to  fire a short bow at the one thats right next to yasha natural 19 very nice /none/  sam im so excited to find out when he will turn on us  matt that is six points of damage to that yuanti and is going then continue to move  actually no at that point he couldnt quite get that far he would have been right there trying  to move behind but because he had to get up from prone lost half of his movement that ends his  go that brings us to jester  laura i want to stand up  matt jester you stand up  laura then im going to cast hold /none/ person on the gray guy with the cobra head  matt on the gray guy okay you release the spell and it has no effect it seems that the  snakelike form that this creature has mutated into has gotten so far out of the realm of humanity to  no longer be considered a person  sam ooh  laura oh shit  travis hold monster hold creature  laura yeah i need hold monster okay  matt thats your action  laura thats my action i dont have any spells for bonus action  travis starting to feel /none/ less terrible about killing them  sam yes  laura okay so i say well shit thats my move  matt all right hisses towards you its fangs bared that ends your go jester caleb and  caduceus you guys are up at the same time  liam i was rummaging in my pockets for the molasses but everybody is dropping so instead i  pull out a burned twig and hold my hand out and cast witch bolt at 3rdlevel through the twig  towards snakeman  matt ooh all righty roll for attack  liam that is a /none/ 21  matt thatll hit  liam okay so thats 3d12 which i have never used in my life i think its this one the fuck  is that thats an 11 plus six is 17 25 lightning damage  matt nice  liam which i did from the ground i guess so i will stand up now am i within five feet of that guy  matt you are yes  liam hey im going to run for it im going to go toward that pillar there  matt over here  liam yeah  matt counting 25 as /none/ you rush by its snake head cranes around and extends out to bite towards  the side of your shoulder and arm as you rush past  sam no caleb no  liam am i able to use shield as a reaction if ive already cast a spell no correct because  ive not tried to do that so i dont know if its allowed  matt if its during your turn i believe you cannot because you only cast one spell  liam per round because as a rogue you could do sneak attack damage and then on an /none/ attack of  opportunity you could do sneak attack damage  matt its different from combat spells versus casting spells during one turn ill have to go  back and look at that specifically but for the time being no because theres the one spell per  round limitation during your turn at least that is going to be all together a 17 to hit  liam oh that hits  matt with that the bite strikes out for you that is six points of piercing damage plus seven  points of poison damage its going to use its secondary /none/ mind fangs this round similar to beau  your brain suddenly gets spiked with this burst of terrible wracking pain that emanates into every  memory of your past life like your existence in one instant is just set on fire and pulled away  travis do not get close if you can help it  matt oh thats not too bad thats 13 points of psychic damage to you  liam ooh thats not too bad  matt that ends your turn then  sam but youre a wee man  matt technically you would have gotten that far /none/ thats halfspeed that ends your turn caduceus  youre up  taliesin im going to shake it off a little bit im going to  matt stand up  taliesin yeah ill stand up im going to back into the corner  matt there you back in towards this cluster of weird mossy plant matter thats on the edge  taliesin im going to use my bonus action to just no im not going to bother with that for  now its not really going to if you go down you go down at this point  travis scoffs  /none/ taliesin no healing im going to do is going to keep you from going down if you get hit by a  triple i can just get you back up  marisha okay  sam yeah but it could prevent okay  matt caduceus what are you doing buddy  taliesin conflicted stuttering  sam youre a lost cause basically  taliesin im going to do a whered it go these are cantrips healing word on beau  sam oh you guilted him into healing you  taliesin i mean eight points of healing  laura its something  marisha /none/ uhhuh thats good yeah  matt there you go take your eight points of healing  marisha ill take it  taliesin im going to hold the channel divinity path to the grave spell for yasha  matt okay that ends caduceus turn beau youre up yashas go is when you release  taliesin mmhmm right as yasha starts to move im going to  travis whats that do  laura youll find out wont you  taliesin you dont know its going to make yasha boss  marisha im going to turn around to cobra kai i want to /none/ be like slurring that was mean because  im still very sick and now im poisoned then im just going to start fucking blind rage in my  slight hallucinatory haze whaling on her  matt okay  marisha her he monster that first one was 21  matt 21 hits  marisha beautiful okay thats eight damage and i want to try stunning strike  sam a what  marisha stunning strike  matt stunning strike on this one that is a 14 plus one 15 whats the dc  marisha 14  matt resists it unfortunately theres a /none/ impact as you hit you realize as youre trying  to do stunning strike you dont fully understand the physicality of it its body and organ  placement is different from the usual other humantype creatures youve studied and so youre  just unable to hit the right point in its body  marisha okay hit it again that was such bullshit 11  matt in your confusion and frustration of not being able to find the soft spot in its body your  second strike goes and it manages to dodge out of the way no impact  marisha /none/ i just look at it and i just go i dont feel very good then im going to do patient  defense  matt all right so then you go in patient defense to protect yourself got it  marisha im a little nauseous  matt that is now yashas turn before yasha can begin the round caduceus  taliesin im going to cast channel divinity on the angry snake in armor  matt okay so the next hit against it it has vulnerability  taliesin yes  matt correct all right  travis what does that mean  matt /none/ and taliesin youll find out  matt whats yasha doing  travis shes turning around and headbutting the woman no im just kidding yeah ill hop off  the platform and run towards snake in armor right the one you cast on  matt right there  travis yes  matt as yasha darts off the pureblood behind manages to swipe out with the scimitar has an  attack of opportunity against her that is going to be a natural theyre rolling really good 17  plus three 20  travis that hits  matt with that yasha suffers seven /none/ six on the d6 seven points of slashing damage reduced to  three because shes raging  travis yes  matt then yasha shrugs off the impact rushes towards the large gray snake entity and  travis reckless attacks  matt go for it  travis oh that definitely hits thats a 22  matt that is correct go ahead and roll damage on that one  travis 11 16 points of damage on the first one  matt okay 16 points of damage it is vulnerable against that that is technically 32 points of  damage from that strike /none/ how does yasha want to do this  laura and marisha cheering  travis damn thats fucking awesome yasha goes dont touch her and just shoves the sword in and  then slowly lifts up the snake just bringing it up through its ribcage  matt as the blade impales it the creature grabs the blade with both hands and hisses as its  lifted up and begins cursing clapping hold on pay attention guys  marisha sorry  matt its okay as the blade carves through the stomach of the gray snake man and is lifted off  the /none/ ground hissing it begins to curse in abyssal as the blade begins to carve up its body  until eventually its hissing turns into a low gurgle and then it just slides off the blade the  parted half of it splitting into two sides onto the ground  liam did all caleb hear with comprehend languages is swear words  matt yes  liam okay  marisha i look at yasha and i just go that was very vomiting and i puke a little bit on her  matt all right  sam whispers sexy  taliesin hot i /none/ needed that today thank you  matt this one is going to seeing how everything is working out yeah does not have that ability  so is instead going to go ahead and counting 30 then try and dash  taliesin thats also a ramp isnt that harder terrain to get up there  matt oh no thats true given that circumstance theres not much of an escape route for this one  laura i would like if she tried to run up the ramp and just kept sliding down  cartoon running sound effects  matt is going to /none/ instead leap down and attempt to assail nott  sam but im hiding  matt not against that one youre not all right so attacks twice with the scimitar ooh natural  20 on that one and a  taliesin denied  sam denied  matt no because when you hold your action you use your reaction to release it so you dont have  a reaction  taliesin it uses a reaction for that thats bullshit  matt sorry buddy thats a natural 20 on one scimitar hit and a 19 on the other to hit the  first /none/ one thats eight plus one nine points of slashing damage on the first hit  sam great ill take that whatever its called  laura uncanny dodge  sam yeah thank you  matt thats four slashing damage and the second one is going to be ooh thats not good two  points of slashing damage  sam okay so thats six total points  matt now with all of its allies fallen around and seeing everyone else standing up its eyes are  darting around looking like its a caged animal snarling and hissing its scimitar in front of /none/  it its swinging it wildly in the air and pointing it towards anything that comes near thats  going to end their turn fjord youre up next  travis fjord rushes up summons the blade and points it at her summoning a little eldritch  energy in his off hand and says drop it thats my turn  matt make an intimidation check  travis okay 13  matt glaring at you doing that hostile snarl  travis no good  matt doesnt seem to be fazed unfortunately  travis oh no thats yashas thats plus two this is /none/ plus seven so counting 18  matt as it snarls at you you pull the blade a little closer to the face up against the chin  resigned snarl and throws the scimitar to the side  cheering  travis stupid double ipads fuck that seems low for charisma  matt i was surprised i was like okay that brings us effectively out of combat  liam slide that a little bit down  travis yeah  matt at this point you all take stock of your surroundings the one standing yuanti the bowls  they were holding and pouring /none/ into this fountain clattered to the ground the one stands there  before you with your blade held towards their neck as theyre snarling  travis caleb  liam yeah  travis you understand anything coming out of this things mouth  liam not at the moment  travis oh caduceus  taliesin yeah  travis whats this one thinking you do that right  taliesin im very curious to see how this is going to go i just want to look her over what is  this room what is happening what was going on  matt well that /none/ would be more generally looking around you guys in this chamber based on the  little bit of travel youve done from the very top of this temple this is the top chamber in the  pyramid youre about partway down from where it is on the surface it continues down you imagine  based on how large it is in size this is the highest part of the pyramid so far within this  chamber there are clusters of these bits of mossy plant life thats growing in elements of the  corners there is a fountain that sits /none/ atop the central platform in the center of the chamber the  water itself is slowly trickling off the sides in small little grooves it looks to be brackish and  green the staircase a few minutes pass revert to stairs so ascension is possible thats the  most of what you can make out in the chamber the pillars appear to be more loadbearing and  designed as you get a closer look make a perception check on this one  taliesin 20  matt interesting point the stonework and the construct of this entire temple is very old /none/  and very simple but you see a lot of intricate carvings and additional stone thats been added to  the interior of the chamber that is all carved to represent snake creatures surmounting and a great  snake god make a religion check  sam oh my gosh all kinds of checks  taliesin 21  matt a lot of the iconography in this chamber is directly based on zehir the  cloaked serpent and is imbuing their power into the snake followers and giving them mutations you  can see people going into this metamorphosis and transforming into /none/ a number of the larger snake  entities you fought or have seen in the city below but all that carving is newer its  fresher its been placed to cover the older stone of the temple and you get the sense that this  temple was not constructed by these yuanti but has been since coopted by them  taliesin priestess of zehir what was this place before you found it  matt looking you over it was shes speaking in  common now it was built to a false idol  taliesin do you know its name or /none/ are you  afraid of it  matt the eyes turn towards you looking up at your large goofy grin  taliesin as im large goofy grin im going to start touching one of the other  priestesses and im going to start the process  matt with that parts of their wounds begin to split open wider as you see bits of  reddishorange fungus begin to find its way out it looks like a sponge emerging from it  taliesin dont mind that  matt she turns to you and goes are  you to let me live /dung/  travis i think that all depends on your cooperation were trying to find our way further  below you can either help expedite that or complicate that  matt make a persuasion check  travis yep mine my stats woo 19  matt looks towards you looks towards caduceus goes i will not sully myself before  the eyes of my god in a flash pulls a dagger from inside the sash attached to the side and  spray cuts her own throat scattering across the front of you caduceus before the body plummets  back onto the ground /none/ with a sick thud on the stonework and then bleeds out a small grin  pulling across her sharpened teeth before her eyes roll back and she expires  taliesin cure wounds  laura gasps can you do that  taliesin i dont know can i or is it too  matt make a dexterity check  taliesin fair all right i was wondering if i  was pushing this too far  laura cure her before she dies  taliesin yeah oh man dexterity check oh no eight  matt the moment of shock hits you having not encountered /none/ someone take their life right in  front of your eyes and that brief moment of pause is enough that when you go to try and collect your  thoughts and cast the spell the spirits already left the body  taliesin i obviously do cast the spell dont i  matt i would say you go to cast the spell  taliesin can i start  matt you begin to and then realize theyve already expired  taliesin thats cheating  laura oh my gosh  travis they take it pretty seriously around here  laura do you think /none/ a lot of gods make people kill themselves  sam are they gone yet  taliesin doesnt seem very helpful  sam ah i was here the whole time  taliesin im going to start poking around some of this is this attached to the walls  liam wait a moment nott have a look around this room do you see anything problematic  sam good idea ill go check the fountain what are these big fancy are these doors on the sides  matt those are some of the inscripted carvings that were placed over the existing stonework of /none/  the chamber  laura im going to search the body of the beast guy  matt okay make an investigation check as youre searching the fountain  sam 19  matt thats not too bad stepping up onto the outside of this fountain its a twotiered  fountain along the floor of the fountain basin within the water on the base there are two  reliefs of snakes coiled sitting underneath the water with empty eye sockets two of them one of  them has empty eyes the other one has an empty eye socket and a dull gray /none/ eye that still remains  the liquid looks grimy and cloudy  sam i hate water  matt you do notice there are on four edges of the bottom basin at the lip of the water and the  water meets the very edge there are slight grooves where the waters slowly trickling out and  down to the floor and where it hits the floor there is no pool of water you inspect closer and  there is a hole beneath each groove where the water itself is pouring through the floor below  you to what you assume /none/ to be a chamber below  laura this shit opens up  liam ja is there anything arcane in nature to the writing on the sides of it or can i ascertain  the purpose of it this fountain  matt make an arcana check to see if you can ascertain any arcane nature to it  marisha while all this is happening im going to go over to one of those moss clusters and just  cuddle up with it and sleep and take a short rest  matt you guys are all taking a short rest  marisha /none/ i dont know while you guys are doing this im going to be like guys they have  pillows  taliesin im going to talk to the moss  sam youre going to what  taliesin im going to ask the moss to make sure you have a very comfy sleep do what they can you  guys take care of that one  travis is beau feeling okay  taliesin no beau is definitely not feeling okay  matt beau you do notice the corner where the moss is as you cuddle up to it and glance  forward /dung/ there is a sixinch or so diameter hole in the corner of the wall  marisha oh  travis thats a big glory hole  liam theres all kinds of people in this world  matt goristro need a way out too  liam tune into all work no play this friday  matt where the moss is growing there is a hole in the stone chamber about that big around that  looks to be a tunnel or tube that slowly descends downward  sam trash chute  matt upon glancing at it the interior is somewhat damp with /none/ condensation and thats where a lot of this  moss is gathering around the outskirts of it you also notice scales little clusters of scales that  are gathered on the edges of the stone  laura ooh snakes come in and out of here  travis directly above the fountain theres a ceiling i take it yes  matt yeah make a perception check  travis oh shit  laura did i find anything on that snake guy  travis 16  matt you glance up on the ceiling and you can see two grooves well not two grooves /none/ but two holes  that are in the stonework above bits of the stone have fallen and cracked a little where those two  holes are glancing directly below them looking up you can see the faint pinhole bits of light  from the sky above you also see the stone right around those holes is faintly stained crimson  travis directly above the fountain  sam that was the sacrifice tablet on top  travis laura and marisha yeah  sam oh thats why its all grimy its blood water ugh  taliesin is there sign of blood in /none/ or around the fountain or in any of the grooves im seeing if  the blood makes it all the way down here  matt make a medicine check  taliesin thats 21  matt with your experience with blood and the viscosity of it you gather that if any of it were  to find its way into the fountain either its not human crimson color enough you dont see any signs of  it currently in here most of the water thats in this fountain right now seems to be just water and  algae and grime that /none/ has built up within the fountain  sam does it look like those vacuous eye holes in the snakes are about the same size as those rubies  that i had found  matt approximately  sam can i just  laura wait  sam look for traps can i just look for traps around the fountain without touching the water  matt sure make an investigation check  laura can i search the cobra head  sam 11  matt yes you inspect the body of the now slaughtered cobra figure it is nude theres no  clothing on /none/ it it is a scaled flesh body  laura aw i thought it had armor on it  matt no no armor it is just a lanky heavily scalearmored snake creature theres nothing to  pull off of its body unfortunately  laura oh try to get some of the poison off its fangs because its poisonous  travis oh yeah in a vial  sam me  laura yeah dont you like doing things with chemicals  sam sure i can but that seems like more of a medical thing  laura im going to try to get the /none/ poison off of it off the fangs  matt okay do you have the materials to do so  laura ive got a vial  sam do you have a medical kit  matt have you ever milked a dead snake for its venom  laura i havent milked this kind of no i havent milked a snake  matt make a nature check for me  laura 15  matt okay youll spend the next 15 or 20 minutes or so attempting to do this and ill come to you  in a minute with your success andor failure /none/  taliesin anywhere where theres moss am i finding these matching holes  matt you go around finding each of these patches yes there are at each corner of the chamber  there are these patches and at each corner you do see one of these holes make a perception check  taliesin ugh ten  matt all you can tell is that you do see the errant scale theyre big scales theyre not  tiny you see bits of snake skin and larger chunks of scales that have rubbed off from something  moving through that chamber  travis /none/ you said six inches in diameter  matt yeah from side to side diameter  travis yeah thats what i meant sorry  taliesin im thinking about plugging these holes  laura thatd be smart  liam what holes  marisha you hear me in the corner go hoo hoo does it echo  taliesin dont do that  matt oh through the hole okay  travis shes all fucking sick and fucked up  marisha yeah hoo  matt it does echo slightly down and you hear it reverberate it does continue downward  liam what are you doing /none/ over there i walk over and i nudge her thigh and butt with my foot what  are you doing shouting in holes  marisha i found a singsongy tube  liam i dont think that is what that is  matt nott what were you doing  sam i was looking for traps i dont think i found it with an 11  matt with an 11 it does not appear to be trapped  travis on the wall where the carvings look like theyve carved over something are there any areas  that arent done as carefully and /none/ you can see what was there before it was carved over  matt whatever stone has been placed has been cemented in with all sorts of adhesive and basic  masonry materials it was designed to permanently cover what was there previously  taliesin how many points down are you right now  laura a lot huh  sam most of them  marisha yeah most of them i have 20 hit points total right now  laura i can do it  taliesin we can both use  marisha am i resting long enough where i can put on /none/ a few hit points  matt if you guys want to take a short rest you can do it at the moment it does not appear that  theres any immediate danger the door locked above you and you dont hear any more scuffling  from above  liam nobody noticed  sam caleb is way worse than her  travis yeah 11  marisha lets take a short rest for sure thats what that means  sam are we plugging up the holes first or are we just watching them  liam its a simple thing if we have /none/ any kind of wood or maybe some silver or copper coins to shove in  laura oh these big giant pieces of wood that we carry around with us all the time  liam like arrow and crossbow bolts and things like that use your noggin or some coins and i  could turn them to stone and block up the holes  laura coins though we would make them  liam copper  taliesin wait what can you turn into stone  sam hes excellent he can make one thing into another we used to have this trick where /none/ we would  sell people a magical box that could turn a copper into a silver  laura you motherfucker that was me  sam ooh did we use that one on you  laura what if we get the weapons off the priestesses and put them in the holes  taliesin thats not a bad idea  laura then you could do that  liam it would be stone swords i would imagine i dont know we could shove as many  laura it would keep them from coming up through it as long as it was blocking yes /none/  matt are you talking about the holes in the corner  they are about that big around just so you know  laura yeah so we could shove a sword in there yeah  matt yeah you could put a sword in there it would be sitting on the ground and blocking the  space a bit  liam i was thinking of jamming it full of a material so its like a clot and then turning that  into stone  taliesin we could do that with we have its a little morose but weve got some dead /none/ people  liam i cant do that to dead people  sam why dont we just shove the dead people in there and then if we see the dead people moving  well all draw our weapons and attack whatever comes out  laura this is so fucked up im into it  sam take some legs and arms and just shove them in the holes  matt youre taking the corpses and filling  travis uhhuh  matt okay  liam you know thats not a bad idea because i could burn the flesh and it would fuse  /none/ travis wow  laura oh god  sam we need to chop yasha chop off all their arms  travis as yasha no  sam jester chop off all their arms  laura well how about i just drag the bodies over i start dragging the body over and shoving  an arm in the hole  matt okay  laura im pushing them  matt to which one one of the purebloods  laura yeah  matt make a perception check  laura oh no  sam nice  laura 20  matt okay as youre dragging it over /none/ you do see a bit of metal jewelry fall out from underneath  the robe  laura yoink  matt it is an intricate stone key that is on a metal chain  laura we should get these of the other ladies  taliesin lets definitely check those bodies  travis we check the other bodies  matt investigation check  taliesin you can take it  travis thats not bad i think i made one this campaign natural 20  matt across the other two bodies you find that was the only key you do find amongst the two /none/ of  them some errant pieces of jewelry you find a nice gold ring youre not quite sure how much  its worth but it looks probably worth something you find two jeweled daggers ceremonial that  they had kept sheathed or one of them had brought out earlier thats what you find on their bodies  travis the gold ring have any sort of symbol on it symbol of the snake  matt both of these blades have very simple snakelike iconography where the pommel is it  looks like the snout of a snake mouth  travis the /none/ ring have anything on it  matt the ring no the ring is a simple gold ring  travis okay  laura you should put it in the fire and see if it shows words  travis and laura what  travis hey caleb  liam yeah  travis ill flip the gold ring over towards caleb i dont know if that does anything but it  was on the lady  liam well i could definitely inspect this do you want me to do that now though or maybe we  are pressed for time  laura were taking /none/ a short rest remember  liam were hanging here  marisha how much time do we have left  liam because im pretty beat up  matt well for you its taken the full hour if everyones taking a short rest its a full hour  of rest  laura so that you can heal  marisha i spent four hit dice im up to 42 points does my malaria that ive come down with change  matt no while youre all resting too jamedi is carefully looking through the different holes in  the side of the chambers and /none/ helping you plug them with some of the dead bodies as you push them in  avantika saunters up to you fjord and says so how long has it been for you eh  travis how long has it been for  matt since youve been called  travis oh oh are people listening or are we by ourselves  matt well say for this purpose you guys are out of earshot of most of the group  travis actually that night after our convo i had another dream  matt then it was destiny what happened tell me everything /none/  travis i found myself under the ocean and then i saw these visions of people that i knew in my  life some that had wronged me some that were very dear to me i had to force my way through  them up this staircase and when i reached the top have you ever heard the word reward  matt i am familiar with this promise aye  travis it was astounding incredible hard to believe it was almost as if the oceans obeyed my  commands  matt glancing at her expression shes enthralled and theres a /none/ moment where her head turns and you  see a flash of jealousy in her eyes and then it reverts back and she goes that sounds incredible  travis how long has it been for you  matt a few years about  travis yeah you know beginners luck right  matt apparently her eyes are still locked on yours and she leans forward and takes her fingers  and puts them through the side of your hair and goes i can trust you right  travis of course  matt and you trust these people  travis with my /none/ life  matt good good she puts her fingers the rest of the way through your hair through the back of  your head pulls you close and headbutts you a little bit and lets you go and gets up and walks off  liam whispering youre a dead man  taliesin whispering seven days  travis anybody looking at us as i turn around  matt jester  travis pained ah ah  matt your short rest comes to a close youve used your hit dice youve healed up a bit youve  gotten your arcane  liam arcane /none/ recovery  matt cool what would you guys like to do  taliesin i would love to take a last look at the snake iconography and the bits that have been  added to see how well i dont want to fudge them or anything but wheres there a keyhole are  these things attached to the wall whats the deal  matt make an investigation check  taliesin oh man it would be eight  matt best you can tell they were carved onto a separate piece of stone that has since been  affixed to the previous backing /none/ of this chamber its been that way across most of the walls here  laura you want me to try to pull it away  taliesin im worried about what that might do i dont know this is obviously an older temple than  theyre giving it credit for which means theres probably things here that are older than snakes  marisha hey cad you know ghosts right  taliesin yeah  marisha deep down inside dont ghosts get mad when you build temples on top of their temples  taliesin i dont know ive never tried  marisha like /none/ graves on top of graves doesnt that make  taliesin no its perfectly fine to stack graves its actually very efficient its a great way of  using if you have a limited amount of space over time you eventually end up doing that thats  common practice  marisha my parents fucking lied to me  taliesin yeah apparently they do that  marisha trilling im still echoing  matt youre shouting into a dead body stuffed into a hole  marisha oh  travis dead armpit  taliesin can we understand any of these glyphs is there anything /none/ that  liam i have looked all around the fountain and im not able to make anything out  matt you dont see any language carved in here its mostly visuals of zehir the cloaked serpent  bestowing the blessing and mutating followers that are rising up his army of snake people  liam are they any seams or visible machinery or cogs or anything  matt there are the holes in the ground at the base of the fountain where the waters is actually  trickling through to something beneath theres the curled snakes that are in the water /dung/ below  those are the only things that youve noticed around the fountain  taliesin i dont think we want the water to go into the ground  laura can i try looking at beau check her out and see if i can see whats wrong with her  matt make a medicine check  travis maybe shes thirsty give her some water from the fountain  laura thats good  sam look at you mrs medicine  laura 24  matt nice looking her over you can see the dark circles under the eyes the continuous sweating  along /none/ the brow and the shoulders and the chest area  laura ooh youre like the gentleman  matt the pupils are slightly dilated and the breathing is more shallow than normal  laura your breathing is more shallow than normal  matt definitely warmer to the touch than a healthy person would be theres some sort of a  disease thats working her way through her system you dont have a whole bunch of book experience  with disease necessarily but you get the sense that this might have been transmitted by some of  the insects that you encountered /none/ on the island on your way in its some sort of disease transmitted  by them through bites  laura and lesser restoration says it can cure one disease but its not that kind of disease  taliesin i already tried and it didnt happen  sam maybe its a magic disease  taliesin or its just mean  sam maybe shes got two diseases  liam maybe matt forgot the quality of lesser restoration  matt thats true it says condition be blinded deafened paralyzed or poisoned and then above it  says diseased and i did not read /none/ that part earlier  taliesin i just suck as a healer  matt as part of my own mistake here well say that this is where you come through with your  casting of lesser restoration before  marisha its a time release capsule  matt yeah exactly it takes a while for it to work its way through the system  taliesin did you take it with food or did you just put it in your system  marisha i take it with booze  laura did you eat it or did you put it up your butt because /none/ it depends  liam thats the fastest way up your butt  matt thats what i get for fast reading going oh well it doesnt list that among the  conditions but disease is not a condition thats my fault  sam as were mounting up or getting ready to do something im going to go over to jamedi cosko  and just say hey jamedi  matt hes sitting there  sam wow that was a tough battle  matt hes inspecting the side of the walls and the carvings  sam oof i need a drink do you /none/ want one  matt i am okay but i appreciate the offer  sam you do drink liquids dont you  matt i do on occasion yes  sam well then why wouldnt you want a nice little nip of something  matt he turns back towards you with a curious glance and says  sam its really good  matt im sober  sam i have some jerky do you want a little nibble you do eat food dont you  matt his eyes narrow yes i would love some jerky  sam here  travis coveted jerky  /none/ matt he takes it from you i appreciate the offer he eats and continues to look over  sam is he swallowing  matt make a perception check  sam ten  matt looks like it you see him chewing chewing a little swallow chew chew chew  laura chewsy chews  matt chewsing  sam all right  laura can i take the tip of one of my paintbrushes and stick it in the holes in the  ground and swirl it around  sam hes not a zombie  matt sure you take your paintbrush and as you /none/ put it in there because there is the groove on  the side of the fountain and it meets with the hole in the ground so the water is going through  the hole below you stick your paintbrush in it and it mixes with the paintbrush its thicker  than water barely its faintly viscous and where the groove is you can see the greenish slick where  slime and general algae buildup has caused it to discolor against the rest of the stone it builds  up a bit and you pull the paintbrush out and it continues /none/ down into the chamber below  laura look at that  taliesin thats a very nice paintbrush  laura no look at the weird algae shit on my paintbrush now  taliesin it doesnt look weird its just algae right  matt it smells like a typical type of algae though the liquid itself has a somewhat acrid  smell to it  liam caleb looks around at everyone doing absolutely nothing and sits down pulls out his  book and starts to identify this ring to see if anythings happening  taliesin does this seem like the stuff thats /none/ in these people ive seen several heads come off and  ive got samples of it available to me  matt no the blood of the yuanti that youve seen as it scatters is a deep purple in color  taliesin including the crazy dude the one that was super  matt correct  taliesin and this is not that  matt correct  laura did i get any poison  matt oh yeah thats right you did not unfortunately as you try and sit there holding  the head over a jar and jamming the fang into the thing /none/ this awkward process you dont get much  out of it unfortunately  taliesin so were looking for a keyhole  marisha ill search for a keyhole while were at it  laura you should stick the rubies in those eyeballs  sam is it time  matt i will say you do recall as when you entered the temple now that youre thinking about it  that the door that locked behind you above you the trap door it had a small opening where a  laura thats how we get out good to know  marisha maybe its /none/ a skeleton key  sam its time  laura wait  liam five more minutes please  matt you complete your ritual the ring is not magical but it is worth a fair amount of gold  taliesin lets assume that bad things are going to come out of these holes at some point  laura can i swirl my paintbrush in the water in the fountain and see if it does anything  matt you swirl the paintbrush in the fountain for a bit it collects some of the brackish liquid  taliesin i have thoughts i dont know /none/  laura it doesnt trigger anything at least  taliesin i mean if i were going to make snake people id put them in a room with snakes and id  have a way of calling the snakes when its time to start changing those people into snakes  marisha maybe the snakes come from the blood sacrifice  taliesin maybe the blood sacrifice is what lets them know its dinner time  marisha thats kind of what i said  taliesin yeah but i think theyre going to yeah you got it i think weve got to move this /none/  fountain  laura lets move the fountain put some rubies in some eyeballs  sam before we go down the fountain im going to walk past jamedi again  matt hes turned around hes still chewing the jerky he puts his shortbow over his shoulder and  gathers his things hes loaded up with pouches and sacks hes not designed to be a combatant  hes designed to be a traveler  sam hoo boy its going to be scary down there i think what im going to do is im going to take  out the snake idol /none/ thing and im going to do a quick prayer to my god do you want to pray with  me do you worship this one too  matt i am not a religious man but i appreciate your sense of inclusion  sam i just want you to be part of the team  travis laughter inclusion  sam were a tolerant group  matt he looks over at the dead serpent people jammed into holes  laughter  matt so it would seem  travis all evidence to the fucking contrary  sam to a point  liam theres /dung/ a yuanti woman hanging by her arm off the wall  travis her fucking arms in it jester is grabbing naked yuanti guy  sam maybe not tolerant  travis milking its face  sam lets go  laura can we have a refresher on what jamedi looks like  matt jamedi has dark brown skin smooth bald head gaunt features hes wearing light cloth  billowing sleeves but its tied with a bracer to each side so it doesnt get in the way of his  hands movement a few pack and satchels around him he looks like what /none/ youd imagine a  professional dungeoneer would look like where he has a few things to defend himself but hes not a  combatant by any means hes very good about getting in and out of places quickly unseen and  gather as much information as he can  travis he got to the top of the temple that was it right  matt correct  travis nott  sam all right im going to ruby it up there was two vacant eye holes  matt there were three of them one of them is missing two eyes the other /none/ is missing one and had  another gray rock in there  taliesin what do i know about this god about this snake god  matt what you know about zehir zehir is a god that wanders in shadow is the creator of snakes  and serpent kin it is essentially the evil god of poisons assassins and darkness they believe that  to keep your acts obfuscated and secret is the greatest means of success strike quickly and  without reason blind the target with their own confusion and kill slowly agonizingly or  worse make them enjoy it /none/ are some of the tenets of their religion and belief  taliesin lets let that inform us as we figure out which of these socket the gems go into  sam im going to put all of them in  laura we only have two rubies wait do you have three rubies  sam i have three oh one was stuck to the back of another one  laura oh that makes perfect sense  sam thats how rubies  laura rubies are very sticky  sam yeah im sorry  laura its okay  matt you reach into the /dung/ water and place  taliesin do we want to do all three at the same time  laura he already did it  taliesin oh well thats fair  sam im going to one at a time using mage hand  laura oh good call  matt using mage hand into the water it finds its way in seems to wedge into and affix mage hand  again into a second one on one side the grimecovered snake thats coiled up there now has  two glittering ruby eyes peering out unnaturally versus the rest of its relatively bland dark /none/  graygreen body you take it and place it in the opposing socket as soon as it slicks into place  you all hear this grinding of stone the fountain shifts and begins to slowly spiral down below as  it begins to move downward beneath it begins to show the about two feet of stone of the floor that  youre standing on eventually gives way to the roof of a chamber below you lightless it is  pitch black below  sam were between floors now  matt youre still standing on the outside of the fountain looking /none/ down in only just the outskirts  of the fountain went down in this slow spiral you glance downward it stops about ten feet below  you it comes to a stop theres a bit of a tenfoot drop to where the fountain is and now  below where it was standing theres about two feet of smooth pillar and then very thin stairs  that continue to spiral down those of you with darkvision since there was no light source in  here you can see in pitch black of dim light within 30 feet the chamber itself goes /none/ just  beyond that so you cannot see the floor of the chamber what you can see the boughs of stunted  trees the smell hits you as you lean forward its a fresh earth and vegetation mixed with a  smell of fermentation and rot it seems that below in this chamber there is a small orchard of some  kind that exists without sunlight  laura cool  travis oh but maybe its nurtured by  sam blood  travis blood and viscous  laura oh shit it only grows by the blood  sam its a blood /none/ orange orchard  travis you can do better than that  matt what do you do  laura could you send some light down there caleb  liam i could do that do we want to do that whats down there  taliesin can we throw a little light down there to see if anything tries to bite at it  liam eh let me borrow this frumpkin flies just down to the fountain  matt okay flittering  liam i want to see if i bamf into frumpkin if i can hear anything below  matt make a perception /none/ check  liam at advantage  laura why  liam because hes an owl and has advantage over hearing terrible both terrible rolls eight  matt absolutely silent  liam frumpkins back on your shoulder okay four globules of light lower down to the fountain and  look over the side to see what that lights up  matt as you guys glance down these small orbs begin to illuminate the base on the floor the  pillar drops down about 40 feet the chamber is about 40foot from floor to ceiling you have  about ten feet before you /dung/ hit the actual staircase down but its a thin staircase each step is  maybe about seven or so inches wide  laura oh thats terrifying  travis nott want to do us a favor to make sure our way is safe  sam mmhmm  laura wait let him keep explaining things first  travis oh yeah sorry  matt you guys look over and see this as well the orbs float down and light the area it is a thick  mass of jungle vines and roots and damp earth that hits the floor you can see a /none/ lot of these  similar trees its just this singular type of tree that is just repeatedly planted throughout  the area you can see these slightly green to yellowcolored fruit that are bared by these  various trees a lot of which have fallen and are beginning to ferment on the ground and rot thats  where you get the smell that hit you originally some of them that have fallen begin to just slowly  rot away and decompose into the floor of this orchard  sam i love me some rotten fruit  liam did you say /none/ how far to the bottom it seemed  matt about 40 feet from where you are about 30 feet once you hit the stairs  sam all right ill jump down to the platform  matt okay make an acrobatics check for me  sam ooh yeah a check 26  matt easy enough to do even the slick spots and as it ground its way down smeared some of the  algae along the outside which caused a faint bit of slickness on outside of the pillar using that  without an issue slide land on the top step /none/ it holds your weight  sam ill take a drink huffing im going to start going down the steps and feeling my way for  traps and stuff  matt you got it  sam is that cocked  laura no  sam okay i cant tell what it is  laura thats an eight  sam thats a 17 for investigation  matt for investigation to see if there are any traps on the way down no traps it is a simple  descent and as soon as you hit the soft floor of the orchard its just natural /none/ ground around you  in the immediate vicinity  sam are there any fruits lying around on the ground  matt yeah two that are within a foot of where you stand theyre somewhat beginning to ferment  sam ill pick one up and smell it sniffing  travis ahah  matt yeah the interior is a bright orangeyellow color it looks fleshy like the inside of a  mango it smells sweet but it has that turning point where its starting to get a little bit  sam do i like it  matt yeah  travis no nott /none/  laura what if they eat this fruit and thats how they im not there  travis dont take it no nott  sam im going to lick it  matt it tastes sweet and tangy  travis these trees grow in total darkness  laura youre not there either  sam im just taking a little bite  matt okay you nibble a little bit it tastes pretty good its got that tang to it that irony  tang aftertaste to it  sam ill just eat one  marisha irony  matt okay you eat it what are /none/ you guys doing  liam well fjord is nudging at caleb  sam its clear come on down  travis fuck  marisha hes looking hes finger flipping  sam hes checking his twitter hes fine  matt its just fun to fuck with you guys  marisha uhhuh  liam in answer to your quiet question i could take the silver thread out and  laura i jump down too  matt make an acrobatics check  liam i could have helped okay everybodys doing things too quickly that thread will take me ten  minutes  matt you /none/ catch yourself there but keep yourself up and begin to descend down the steps and below  travis i was going to have caleb put the silver string at the entrance so wed know if somebody  came in  liam thats ten minutes if we want to take it  travis and taliesin its locked and we have the key  travis how did we get in we picked the lock well be fine  marisha i jump down  matt okay beau acrobatics check  liam jump just down the 40 feet  sam no to the staircase /none/ its a tenfoot fall  marisha 14  matt you hit it and your foot hits a slick spot you catch yourself and hold onto the edge adjust  and then continue down without issue  laura oh god 14 is like the  marisha its pretty high considering  liam you two are down the two of you  laura mmhmm  liam youre up at the top of the tower  sam no she jumped already its you caduceus and fjord i think  taliesin im making an athletics check ten  matt ten unfortunately theres not a /none/ whole lot of handhold in this area its a smooth tenfoot  space and as you try to find a handhold to grab onto you just fall straight down  liam i cast feather fall on him and me and him and yasha  sam you can do that  matt on how many  liam on five people  matt thats awesome thats slick  liam choose up to five falling creatures within range i guess i push the two of you as i fall  matt yeah i was going to say theyre not falling as soon as /none/ he slips in  liam i see him fall and i shove these two off and i go casting  matt okay do you take it do you guys  travis yeah i mean im looking over the edge like this  matt as caleb sees this happening shoves  travis i shouldve known  matt the four of you fall and begin to slowly drift  travis  that you had everything under control  matt you all land gently on the tips of your toes before the rest of your body finds its weight now  resting onto /none/ the soft floor of the subterranean orchard  laura that was pretty cool  sam wow  liam thats a good one  taliesin im going to let the trees know that were here  matt nott about a minutes past since youve eaten that fruit and you start feeling a little  tingly on the inside of your body  sam yummy  laura tingly how  liam does it burn when you pee  matt you turn to look at caleb and its crazy his hairs purple now its pink now its orange  now its purple  /none/ sam oh no  marisha oh shit  sam what is happening  travis your eyes are like big black saucers  matt his pupils are purely dilated  liam your eyes are normally like tea saucers but now theyre like full plates are you all right  sam giggling  matt as youre glancing around the light orbs that are slowly drifting theyre leaving trails behind  sam oh yes you should try some of this fruit guys  matt make a perception check  laura oh god  matt with disadvantage because you  laura because youre high /none/ as fuck  sam six  matt six okay  sam man this is the craziest place weve ever been  laura nott are you okay  sam do that more it feels nice the wind do that more slower  liam how much have you had from that bottle of yours  sam just let me enjoy this  laughter  sam man i just had one of these fruits and i think i know everything now you know it doesnt  matter if jamedis alive or dead were all going to be dead at some point  travis /none/ i think hes clearly messed up did you have a fresh fruit or  matt at this point jamedi and avantika have managed to join you below in the chamber  sam oh hey  matt hello  sam hey  matt jamedi he pulls out a torch and lights it up its very bright  sam ah  laughter  matt everyone turns slowly to nott  travis its like rocket raccoon going through the dimensional rifts  liam theres already a merry go round of lights going around notts head  matt as the faint orbs are met /none/ with the brighter torchlight from jamedi it opens up the chamber  liam its like the sun in here  matt this entire chamber is roughly 70ish feet by about 50 feet in size this orchard these  trees are everywhere  liam fivesided still  matt no this chamber is foursided actually it seems make an intelligence check actually  liam natural 20  matt based on the shape of the temple as you saw it the size of the chamber you were just in and  the chamber below there should be more space on the sides and /none/ the front of it it looks like this  is probably a central chamber of this floor  travis its 50 by 70  laura do we see any movement in here  matt make a perception check with disadvantage well with advantage because you have the  torchlight on or no sorry regular roll brain working its been a week  laura its very shitty six  matt yeah nothing  taliesin im going to let the trees im not going to touch the tree but im going to walk up  i dont know the last time you /none/ had people in here but were going to try and pass through if you  want well take some fruit if you want the fruit to leave the chamber if not well try and do our  best to leave it be we respect your space here  matt seems receptive  taliesin cool  travis jamedi captain either of you know anything about these trees or its fruit that  grows in darkness  matt jamedi looks around i did not go this far into the temple i returned for your aid so no  taliesin does this look /none/ or smell like anything those people eat  matt it is very possible i didnt spend too much time studying the inner workings of their  daytoday i was more focused on surviving avantikas looking around arms crossed glancing  keeping her hands near her weapons  taliesin i dont see how those things are noninterchangeable  marisha does this seem to be a lot of fruit  matt its not a massive amount of it but each tree is in the process maybe holding about a few dozen  taliesin its like i got a lemon tree  laura /none/ does this seem like anything weve seen before anywhere these trees this fruit  matt no not this stunted theyre squat trunk and the top doesnt reach the very top of this  chamber theyre about five or so feet below theyre not massive trees by any means but the  idea of trees like this and as you look at it now the color previously you had just the  faint light looking across the ground as you look up towards the leaves in these trees the  colorations not green necessarily its more of a deep purplish brown /none/ color to the leaves  laura creepy  travis whats our footing like stone roots wet  matt currently it looks to be soft earth and where are the roots and various vines that have  entwined their way around from other plant life that have been subsisting off of the ecosystem  thats built in this space  liam what about entrances and exits  matt you can certainly go check make an investigation check  liam nott will you come with me please never mind beau will you come with me please  marisha yeah  matt your /none/ vision is jittery there nott  sam oh sure im going to sit  taliesin yeah fjord  travis i heard what you said to the trees any way to see what runs through these things  taliesin how are you all drinking what is it that you live off of how is this possible in  here im going to quickly out of fear cast eyes of the grave one more time  matt okay glancing about the same source the one small blip on your radar jamedi  taliesin yeah all right  matt in thinking of those /none/ questions the ground itself is damper around the base of the fountain  travis directly below where the fountain was  matt yeah  taliesin these are carnivorous are the trees the same color as the blood of these creatures  upstairs is it a similar  matt you could say its comparable in some ways it goes from a brown to a faint purpleish tint  taliesin i think theyve been feeding these things  marisha yeah with blood definitely with blood  liam ja theyre pouring bloody water down here  travis but why  marisha well judging /none/ by notts reaction right now and weve already seen that these people  hunt so clearly this fruit isnt their main food supply  laura they like to get high  taliesin is there any signs of animal life in here is it any more complex of an ecosystem i  feel like im missing something  matt you dont see any signs of animals you dont see bits of droppings or claw marks or teeth  marks on any of the nearby trees at all  marisha im assuming its for rituals  matt youre looking for  liam /none/ entrances exits stonework writing i think you said investigation  matt investigation check because at an immediate glance you dont see theres no open archway or anything  liam 18  marisha ten  matt as you two begin to make a perimeter you dont see any doorways what you do see are on the  south wall the western wall and the northern wall there are large stone tablets that are  affixed to the wall similar to the ones you saw above that have almost mirroring inscriptions of  this same vision of zehir bestowing these mutations upon /none/ the followers on the bottom of  each of these tablets there is a hole thats about 12 inches wide and about five or six inches tall  marisha a tablet a door  matt theres no door that you can tell but you see these large stone tablets that are affixed to  the north western and south wall each of these tablets is about maybe eight feet wide ten feet  tall and the base of it right before where it meets the floor there is a little space a little  hole if you will thats about /none/ 1214 inches wide and about 45 inches tall  laura is it roundy or is it rectangular  matt its rectangular you also see amongst the ground as your walking your foot hits something  and you look down and you can see a wicker basket an empty wicker basket thats overturned  liam is there any blood in the wicker basket  matt no  taliesin i think its for fruit collecting  marisha i grab nott and say can i pick you up  sam i thought i was already picked up  marisha pick nott up walk /none/ nott over to one of the tablets well say the north wall and i face  nott towards the tablet and i say what do you see  travis deep warped voice what do you see  sam gibberish  matt as these globes of light are brought over to see it its quite beautiful but before you even  see the relief in the wall theres this extremely bright series of symbols glowing on the stone in  front of you  marisha you can see glowing symbols sorry you didnt tell me that  sam oh what huh /none/  marisha what do you see  sam i see glowing symbols  marisha holy shit but i cant see glowing symbols  sam theyre so fucking bright  laura can you draw them what do they say  sam wait you cant see them  matt they look like that  sam you cant see this you can see me cant you  marisha yeah i walk nott over to the western wall what is it  matt another set of symbols say it what is it  sam screaming  liam lets hold on a second its been /none/ less than an hour if i put my hand oh wait no it hasnt  matt no its been more than an hour  liam im going to start casting comprehend languages again  marisha i take nott over to the southern wall  sam stop this i cant take any more  marisha draw draw nott draw  sam sobbing ive seen too much  laura should we have been keeping track of which ones were on which wall  marisha i went northern western southern that is right right  sam i think thats the right order i /none/ dont understand any of this shit  matt make a perception check  sam seven  matt okay  laura caleb do you want to eat some fruit and look at the  sam do you want me to draw what i see  laura yeah  liam feed me while im casting  taliesin i think maybe you should draw what you see  liam give me ten minutes thats on the tablets right  travis any tracks in the dirt  matt make a survival check  laura i give her my sketchbook with ink and stuff so /dung/ she can draw the runes that she sees  matt okay  travis 13  matt you can see some grooves in the damp dirt and areas where the soft bits of leaves that are  fallen that are pressed down but the grooves are pushed through pressure  travis not necessarily bipedal  matt no not necessarily  laura i thought you were trying to say by people  matt that works too attempting to sketch these over im going to say make an intelligence check  with disadvantage please nott  sam okay intelligence check  matt yes /none/  sam 13  matt you do what you think is a decent job trying to copy what you see it takes a little while  liam that would punch in the ten minutes i need to cast comprehend so i will retrace all the  steps and place my hands on that writing to see if it reveals its meaning to me  matt okay looking at the spell here  taliesin yeah thats an interesting question  laura singing you need to eat some fruit  sam im going to take some time to start painting my skin /none/ and drawing my skin because it feels so good  travis yeah youre literally peeling up your skin cool scratching  matt it doesnt do anything because you cannot see the language you have to be able to touch it  and see it to read it  laura eat the fruit  liam foomph lights floating around  matt right you see no language  laura you have to eat the fruit  liam oh i didnt know that she sees it because oh i didnt know  matt youre figuring this out now as you go to the /none/ wall  liam i do a lot of reading of spells and not a lot of paying attention you guys  matt thats okay as you go to the wall theres nothing there youre like theres no language there  laura here  liam so thats how you see it  laura i cut some fruit and stick it on his mouth  taliesin why dont you have the owl see it and maybe you could see through the owl  laura too late i already put it on his mouth  taliesin or you could just eat that  /none/ marisha i help it down a little bit more  sam is this good enough for him to discern  laura too late hes already getting high  matt laughs caleb eats the fruit  travis he bought the ticket  matt that would have been probably decent enough to get through that message over the next minute  or so caleb the colors of the lights begin to shift you guys watch as caleb begins to slowly  move the floating orbs in different patterns gets distracted by his own cantrip  travis deep and warped caleb how are /none/ you feeling  liam hey i stole this ring from you  laura caleb caleb caleb  liam oh it echoes in here  matt caleb make a perception check  liam that is a 16 total  matt actually it would be with disadvantage because of the effect of the  liam that is a 12  matt glancing about the interior of the chamber you look in the directions where nott was and you  can see the three markers and you see a faint fourth glow from the eastern wall  liam eastern wall  laura theres /none/ another wall  liam i feel really good but i know  laura tell us what the walls say  liam wait wait  all wait  liam i know that i am not in a good position so somebody come with me to make sure  sam ill go  travis and marisha no no not you  sam i protect him  laura i go with him  travis i pick up nott by the scruff of her neck and am holding her  sam its so far  taliesin i am going to sit on unbelievably high /none/ alert and this place is giving me the heebie jeebies  matt jamedi is holding the torch as a light source for those who need it avantika is  grinning watching this whole thing  taliesin im making my own light source on the staff now  matt as youre walking by avantika saunters up to you fjord and goes like i can certainly  say this is the most entertaining bunch ive traveled with in some time  travis consummate professionals thats what we are  matt oh of course we wouldnt be this far if they werent  /none/ liam blueberry come on  laura im coming  matt you head to the southern wall  liam yeah i always know where north is so its one of these ways  marisha so its one of these ways  sam you can see words  laura what does it say  matt he cast comprehend languages  marisha is that south  laura thats the east  liam he said south just now i thought you said south east was the one that we hadnt checked out yet  matt correct  marisha you better be writing this shit /none/ down  liam but i dont know which way i am going at the moment so dm which way does my keen addled mind  tell me the direction i just went south  matt south  liam south this one says the fountain feeds the garden oh we knew that part okay lets  keep looking at the okay whats this one  laura lets go to the next one  matt which one do you go to  liam go to the west  matt western one  liam ja  marisha west  sam need water  /none/ liam the garden feeds the warden  marisha the garden feeds the warden  liam the warden sounds like a sentient ooh i feel good  laura go to the nother one  sam the nother one  liam i always know which way north is so lets go east  marisha east south west east  liam oh this is like a chain and if i wasnt high as fuck i would get it the sacrifice feeds  the fountain  laura yeah thats the top thing  liam ja so this is part a of the equation feeds /none/ the fountain the fountain feeds the garden  the garden feeds the warden the warden feeds the snakes lets go to the last wall the warden  guards the false serpent  travis and sam the what  liam false serpent  laura the warden guards the false serpent  liam so there is a false serpent that lives here and we have yet to meet the warden  matt avantika just looks straight to you and goes the false serpent  taliesin the old serpent  marisha what  laura the false serpent  taliesin i imagine they are /none/ speaking of the previous owner of this temple  travis zehir  taliesin probably beneath us  marisha whys she looking at you like you know what shes talking about  matt we are close  marisha what  matt what do you wish to do  marisha i wish to know what avantika just fucking said  laura lets look for the warden  travis she said were close  taliesin we are the warden right now  marisha were close  taliesin weve got two wardens  laura oh you guys are the wardens  sam im the /none/ warden  taliesin this is what im estimating  laura you guys are the wardens  sam i dont feel wardeny  travis jester i dont think anyone is the warden  taliesin im going to take a look  liam i think we have yet to meet the warden  travis oh  matt theres a strange moment as nott this cold sensation on your back youre like oh  that kind of tickles it begins to constrict and you guys glance over and one of the vines is  curled up around nott and begins to tighten around /none/ it  laura oh no get caleb off the ground  sam it feels like theres a vine around me but i know its not real  matt you take 15 points of bludgeoning damage and are grappled  travis oh fuck yasha runs over  matt you are restrained  laura i lift caleb off the ground because im next to caleb still  liam oh  matt all right  travis yasha runs over to nott and with the  matt go for it yasha goes in takes two swings  liam youre hurting my ribs  travis /none/ reckless on el vine  matt you got it you hold him up at which point a vine wraps up around your body jester that is a  16 to hit  laura doesnt hit me  matt you kick it off and pull away you can now see this  laura i am walking around so the vines dont get me  matt this thick vine that is rising up and it curls around snakelike in its own right towards  you other vines begin to thicken in the area around you and the roots begin to turn the /none/ area  into hard terrain to walk through the floor of the forest seems to briefly come alive and you now  see these large two thick entangling vines one thats wrapped entirely around nott and  constricting her tiny body the other one trying to wrap its way around jester  travis her first strike was 21 second one was 14  matt both hit roll damage  travis thats nine points of damage on the first one 12 points of damage on the second one  matt 12 points of damage on the second one you can now /none/ see as this is happening who wants to  take action on this one  marisha ill do something and ill say caduceus can you talk to them  taliesin youre making a terrible mistake stop please  marisha youre always so convincing except for now i pummel on the ones jester saved nott or  is nott still  matt no notts still being constricted  travis oh its still there it didnt cut through it  matt yeah no  travis oh wow  laura what didnt cut through  travis 20 points of damage  matt carved /none/ into and cut elements of it you can see the vine itself where its split open  theres a hardy thick light green tendonlike material beneath its a very strong vine its  wrapped around multiple times around nott now and its pulling and trying to squeeze her to death  sam its fine  marisha can i wedge my hand in there to try and give a little bit of breathing room for nott as i  punch the vine  matt you can either attempt to help her escape or you can attempt to punch the vine the /dung/ choice is yours  marisha ill attempt to help nott escape  matt all right this is your action  marisha it might be a terrible mistake  matt make an athletics check  marisha okay singing dont fuck me gil fuck me almost every time nine  matt nine unfortunately its too strong and as you try and pull the vines away they just are  locked in this death grip around nott that ends your action caduceus  taliesin is it wet in here or is it dry in here would you say  matt its fairly damp /none/ its not super moist but there is a general hint of humidity in the air  taliesin out of curiosity  matt while this is happening nott what are you doing  sam i am trying to cast teleport i do not have teleport  matt no  sam im trying it anyway  matt youre just focusing action spent willing yourself somewhere else make a constitution  saving throw  sam okay con save 18  matt 18 all right you dont pop a blood vessel in your eye but it gets close  sam i think it worked /none/  taliesin can i use create or destroy water to try and dehydrate these vines really badly  matt you can  matt and taliesin  certainly try  taliesin i am going to cast create or destroy water and try and dehydrate as much of the tree  and see if that while i make my way to some higher ground  sam remember laura you do have a weasel around your neck  laura good point  matt okay you manage to disperse a lot of the moisture in the air but you cannot pull it from a /none/ creature  taliesin okay cant pull it from a creature  matt you would know that with the spell  taliesin i would know that okay im going to try and god the only thing i can think to do at  the moment is just do a sacred flame to try and get it to let go while i make my way to higher  ground because maybe we need to give it blood i dont know  matt all right it fails its save roll damage caleb what are you doing youre being held up by  jester /none/ right now  liam i can tell that things are going very poorly so i reach into my pockets and i pull out a bit of  iron dust and i go blowing and jester doubles in size  travis oh tall jester  matt now giant jester is holding caleb over your shoulder  liam hey oh  taliesin 11  matt 11 points of damage all right  liam you get advantage on strength checks and strength saves right now so you can bust if  youre grappled  matt that ends your go caleb casts enlarge on /none/ giant jester fjord what are you doing  travis can i run over to the basket that was tipped over  matt yeah  travis can i run over and grab it and pick it up and look at it  matt sure you grab it and pick it up and look at it it looks like on the inside it had some  elements of remnants of fruit that may have scuffed part of the wicker but other than that it  just looks like a basket  travis fuck ill just fire two blasts of eldritch blast at /none/ the vine thats holding nott  matt well youll get to that next round because it takes your action to lift up the basket and  inspect it  travis got it  matt thats okay that ends your turn now the vines the one that constricts once again to you  nott as its pulling you in you feel now these thorns emerge from the inside of its constriction  and poison bursts into your system you take  laura did i get to do an action on that last one  matt 23 points of poison damage  /none/ sam 23 nice  matt yes your action was lifting caleb up off the ground  travis only you can start a forest fire  matt the other one will attempt to constrict you again that is a 14 to hit  laura no  matt with that you kick it off with your giant foot the vine pulls itself back up now you can go  laura okay im going to cast spirit guardians can i walk over to where nott is im going to  cast spirit guardians and anything that enters that space has to make a /none/ wisdom saving throw or  take 3d8 radiant damage  matt whats the dc on that  laura wisdom save of 15  matt three and 13 they both fail roll 3d6 damage and they both take it  sam these are creatures  laura this is the vines that are attacking you and if im close by anything thats attacking me too  matt youre close enough to the vine that is trying to attack you yeah  laura okay 11 points of radiant damage no 3d8 those are 3d6 hold on i rolled wrong  travis please be /none/ more than 18  laura ooh thats better 15  matt 15 points of radiant damage to each the vine that was constricting around you hadnt taken  any damage yet you see a burst of radiant energy you watch as it lights up the area briefly the  one thats currently burning around there the radiant damage burns past you can see part of it  blacken from the impact of the radiant energy but its still holding nott tight that ends your go  yasha whats yasha doing  travis fuck yeah yasha would like to fucking ragé /none/ and she will take to ragé take two  strikes using divine fury while shes raging of radiant damage towards  matt go for it  travis reckless thats 20 for the first one  matt that hits  travis second one is 23  matt both hit roll damage still tearing into that same vine thats holding nott  travis 19 points with radiant damage on the end of that  matt correct damage on the second strike 2d6 plus five weirdly cocked  travis 11 points of damage  matt 11 points of damage hacking through that vine /none/ its still holding nott but it is looking  really rough its on the edge of keeping itself held together and you can see the parts of where  yashas carved through and where the radiant energy has blasted it its starting to leak this  thick green sap its having a hard time  travis thick green sap  matt yeah its a plant bleeding if youve ever seen a plant bleed  marisha its a green day cover band  matt there you go beau  marisha okay shit we didnt roll initiative notts still stuck  matt /none/ yeah notts still stuck though the vine around nott is hurt pretty bad  travis the vine that was holding her was the one that caleb exploded  marisha yeah im going to take my staff and where jester already put in holes im going to  grunting  matt go for it the one thats around nott or the one thats after jester  marisha nott nott  matt the one thats around nott or the one thats after jester  marisha nott  matt okay go for it  marisha i didnt know about the one after jester /none/ im sorry  laura no im good  marisha okay the first one is 22  matt that hits  marisha oh its staff staff magic ten  matt ten points of damage all righty  marisha second attack not as good 12  matt 12 misses you swing the second hit with the staff and as you do the vine arcs out of the way  and it hits air  travis fuck  marisha and bonus attack bad badish 13  matt 13 just hits  marisha and travis ooh  sam badish  taliesin badesque  marisha /none/ eight damage  matt at this point i also need you to make a strength saving throw  marisha me  matt yep  marisha because im attacking  matt now that youve moved in the vines in the area begin to entangle and move around  marisha okay 14  matt you manage to push off of the vines on the ground around you that are trying to entangle and  hold your legs to the ground jester i need you to also make a strength saving throw  liam at advantage because of enlarge  matt yes  /none/ laura oh thats  sam damn  taliesin hulk smash  laura 22  matt no issue you just kick out of the vines without problem  liam yeah technically  laura technically you suck vines  matt that brings us to nott on the top of your turn as you are still constricted you take  another 19 points of poison damage  sam im out  marisha fuck  matt nott goes unconscious and you watch the vines closing entirely around her face and torso  just the arm poking out of the side you can now see /none/ as the lighter green skin tone get darker with  blood now being pushed towards the outer sides of her limbs at end of your turn nott i need you  to make a death saving throw  marisha oh my god  sam 16  matt thats a success all right caduceus  taliesin i can sometimes influence plants im going to try and get them to stop  matt youre going to attempt to  taliesin im going to try to tell the trees to stop  matt okay what are you saying  taliesin were not here /none/ for you let go and stop this or i cant be held responsible for what  happens to this place do not join the cycle of life and death here  matt make an intimidation check  taliesin do i get advantage  laura trees and vines  travis yeah theyre mean though  taliesin an intimidation check  matt mmhmm  taliesin all right no wow thats a terrible roll and a terrible roll seven no no eight

 laughter  travis aw fuck five points of damage  matt five points of /none/ damage you carve through the vine bisecting it you watch as now looking as  you get close up you can see the base of it now this slowly shambling chunk of rooted plant as  you run forward your blade arcing through the air you cut through the base of it the actual  vine falls limp and uncurls notts body falling to the ground unconscious that vine is destroyed  marisha yay  laura get her off the ground get her off the ground as i spit on him  matt you still have another attack and theres /none/ the other vine still

travis that is my armor class  matt /none/ it hits you it whiplash wraps around fjord pulls your arms to the side of your body  and constricts you you immediately take nine points of bludgeoning damage and you are grappled  and restrained  travis okay okay  matt all right that finishes that ones go that brings us to now avantika kicks in avantika  pulls out blades and is going to go ahead and

feel like you got avantika on your mug  marisha oh yeah kind of this was me at the live show  matt avantika just starts eviscerating this vine with two slaps of the rapier and then one giant  dagger strike that carves up the side looking pretty hurt still holding on though that being  the case were going to be back at the top that brings us to yasha whos next  travis yasha will run clearly disturbed by fjord being lifted into the air and will certainly  /none/ make two reckless attacks  marisha yeah yeah yeah  travis she says flirtily put him down  laughter  sam im a little confused  matt ashleys going to be real happy  marisha yasha youre just so flirty today  travis nine nine its nine  sam put that stud muffin down so i can make out with him  matt nah it misses  travis second

its life as its trying  to pull you back to wherever it crawled its way out of but still standing that finishes yashas  go jester  laura im going to cast   matt its barely holding on  laura okay im

other shoulder  matt okay the giant jester stomping out the vine on the ground its now /none/ like splattering parts  of it are being crushed and turned to pulp  travis oh thanks jester scared moans  laura dont worry little children  travis now am i over your shoulder in like the baby burping pose or sitting on your shoulder  laura youre sitting on my shoulder caleb is draped over the shoulder  taliesin just need to get nott to higher ground  matt caleb is firemans carry  travis got to get nott on   taliesin to higher ground would be nice anywhere where we can see clearly  liam quickly before /none/ this runs out  laura we need to heal heal nott heal nott  taliesin i just do we know where were going yet  travis i think down but i dont know how to get there  marisha i run over and i pick up nott and i  taliesin are we still being attacked by these things  matt make a perception check  taliesin sarcastically happily  sam and marisha vocalizing intro to the lion king  matt jamedis still holding the torch up to give you a good range of light  taliesin 20  matt /none/ looking around you you can see where the two clusters of these weird vine creatures were  these assassintype vines you see theres just two of them and glancing about the chamber and  giving a good solid look you dont see any more of that type it looks like these two were the  ones that were rooted here either as protector or had just woven their way down here and became part  of the ecosystem but at the moment you dont see any other threat  taliesin are we taking ten minutes or are we just moving /none/ on now  travis we should move now right  marisha we should move  taliesin well all right then im going to just pull a little energy out of the crystal and im  going to tap nott on the forehead and cast cure wounds at level three  matt all right  taliesin you have 30 hit points  sam whoa thats tons  liam also enlarge runs out and we crash on top of jester  laura how long does it last  liam one minute  laura brief exertion  matt both fjord and caleb crash /none/ onto the ground tumbling onto your sides  travis sorry jester  laura no im sorry that you werent protected earlier  travis you all right  laura im good thank you for asking  taliesin thats good to know too  sam panting that was amazing i would do it again in a second holy shit i mean we used  to mess around with chemicals but nothing like that  laura is he still high are you still high are either of you still high  matt they both very much are you have no idea how long /none/ this is going to last  laura spiritual unicorns are dancing around you guys as this is going on  sam excited laughter did you see that  laura theyre like this big  sam how is my hand as big as yours now it doesnt make any sense  liam ooh i will turn your hand into gold  taliesin im going to inspect these two plants if theres anything that would have been difficult  to get to past these two plants i feel like maybe those are the they might be   sam remember that there /none/ was those  matt the only other thing youve seen are the central slips the holes in the bottom of those  three tablets  travis lets go look more closely at those  taliesin im going to cast some im going to use my light maybe to give everybody a little view  matt as you make your way towards some of those doors were going to take a little break  groaning  matt i just realized were past nine oclock take a break here well be back here in a short  bit to pick up their /none/ investigation as to where the next exit point of this chamber may be in the  meantime

where we left off mighty nein you began to go and inspect some of these tablets with  these gaps beneath the bottom which way did you want to go  travis oh the one that was  marisha how big are the gaps  matt theyre about 12 to 14 inches wide and about four to five inches tall or /none/ on the bottom  taliesin north  travis sure  marisha yeah because north was  taliesin the warden garden  marisha the warden okay but hang on do we want to go in like order and start with the fountain  feeds the garden sorry sorry sorry the sacrifice feeds the fountain at east  matt all right there is no tablet or hole in the east  marisha oh what about   taliesin south  marisha yeah south fountain feeds the garden  matt okay into the south whos doing what are you looking through it  /none/ taliesin ill take a look  matt all right make a perception check are you doing it with a light source below  taliesin can i   liam intoxicated absolutely huffs  taliesin im going to keep some distance to see if anything snaps at me  matt perception check  taliesin ive gotten a little jumpy not very good 15  matt glancing inside you see a hatchery of some kind theres a strong smell of fermentation in  there a majority of the room seems to be a series of clusters of roughly one foot tall eggs /none/ theyve  all been placed in various edges there nestled in soft dirt and molding fruit  sam eggs are always good in dd  taliesin can i get a sense of the sort of animal that wouldve laid  matt this is the south room right  taliesin yeah this is the south fountain feeds the  matt you also see what appears to be a broken humanoid corpse long decomposed jammed by one of  the clusters  travis is he wearing manacles  matt no no manacles  taliesin also can i figure out being in here /none/ do we have any idea how those portholes those four  portholes up above would feed into this room  matt you can look around you go ahead and make a perception check  taliesin how healthy does that egg look  matt well there are a number of eggs inside there  taliesin theyre lizard eggs arent they  matt they look to be somewhat reptilian yeah  taliesin mmhmm how healthy oh yeah  matt i mean its hard to tell from this distance all you see is the eggs and the body there  marisha i assume /none/ youre telling us all this yeah  taliesin yeah theres some reptile large reptile eggs in the  matt they start about four feet into the room and the room itself from what you can see down  there is enclosed  taliesin it appears to be a hatchery of some kind  marisha is this the fountain feeds the garden maybe this isnt the garden that they  were talking about  taliesin yeah ill take a look to see if  matt go for it  travis no keyholes right  taliesin god these are terrible 14  /none/ matt you do see in some of the walls about two feet off the ground similar sized holes that are  pushed in against where some of the vines and some of the carvings are that curl upward you imagine  probably meeting with some of the holes above you get the sense that perhaps something uses these to  traverse up and down parts of this temple  taliesin it could be where once the eggs hatch they come up or this is how they get the eggs  down this is a nesting area all right whats the /none/ west side really quickly  matt you head to the west one and you go ahead and look inside i imagine putting the spheres in  as well make a perception check  liam i can feel my hair growing  taliesin oh thats better 19  matt glancing inside its a relatively simple chamber from what you can tell there are  elements of stonework placed in but they havent been carved and they are only partially done  theyve gotten most of the temple finished and they havent quite fully completed their work in  going over the /none/ walls inside the small chamber is maybe 15 by ten feet and while theres no other  real discerning shapes or details to it you do see about ten feet ahead of you it descends into  stairs tenfoot wide set of stairs  liam is there any writing or anything in there  taliesin no but i think it keeps going down i think they just never quite sealed it up  marisha seems like a pretty important entrance i dont know why that would be last on their list  taliesin theyre not expecting problems and they dont /none/ seem that bright  liam theyre not the warden can take care of itself  taliesin i guess well take a quick look at north just to finish things off  matt okay make another perception check please  sam why is everyone yelling  taliesin 22  matt this looks to be a sister hatchery room to the one on the south this one does not contain a  body but just other clusters of eggs  taliesin is it possible to tell if these eggs might hatch anytime soon or are they thats left  of them  /none/ matt make a nature check  taliesin all right lets do that my nature is terrible which is ironic but i rolled a natural  20 so that should do  matt with what experience you have with seeing much smaller snakes and other type creatures in  nature youre not really fully understanding the gestation period of yuanti these eggs dont look  like theyre ready to hatch in the next few days or so theres still some time before the oldest  clutches of  taliesin is this true both look similar both seem  matt yeah id /none/ say so  taliesin theres probably no direct danger leaving these things untouched for now i think  weve found a way down there at the very least  travis we found our way into the room though  taliesin how big is the entrance into that little unfinished  matt its the same fiveinch tall 12 13 inches wide space  marisha do the tablets look to be on any hinges or levers  matt make an investigation check  marisha okay thats a natural one  matt you have no idea  laura can i try reaching with /none/ my hands and pulling  matt sure make a strength check  laura no im still big no im not still big humming no 12  matt its wide enough the actual stone tablets are maybe about three and a half four inches  long you can get your fingers through and pull on the other side but it does not budge at all  taliesin does it seem like its separating from the rock even a little if i take a look at it  from the side  matt make an investigation check  taliesin aw man low /none/ intelligence thats a 13  matt okay it doesnt separate at all but you do see each of the tablets where theyre part of the  wall theyre actually recessed in as opposed to placed against it you can see a very very faint  gap where they would probably slide either side to side based on some mechanism  travis nott you think you can fit under that gap  sam yeah course i can thats a vast cavern down there  travis get going  sam okay  matt laughter which one are you going in  sam /none/ which one are we near which one had the stairs going down the stairwells  matt its the western one  sam yeah  matt all right make an acrobatics check just to see if you can squeeze through the space  sam 14  matt your small goblin form has no real problem you have to rearrange your skull at a  certain angle to make it through the gap but you do manage to make your way through to the opposite  side of the chamber  travis what do you see  taliesin throw some light in /none/ there  sam ill be back in five minutes  travis no no what do you see in the room nott  sam oh what i dont know what do i see  matt you see the simple chamber it looks like at first there was unfinished carvings in the  wall so it looks like the carvings come to a completion and then the rest of it is a solid  stone interior that stops at a wall on the opposite end about 15 feet in and stairs that  slowly curve down about tenfoot wide just begin to /none/ go on a wide spiral downward  sam theres some carvings and theres a moving staircase  marisha did you say moving  travis i think she said moving staircase yeah  sam its not moving fast its just going back and forth  liam pressing face against the crack on do you see jester wants to know if you see a switch  laura like a lever like a switch or anything  taliesin im going to keep trying see if theres anything that connects to anything  liam do you need a globule or an owl  sam /none/ is there light or any keyholes or any switches or  matt make an investigation check  sam im fascinated by the walls i rolled a 28  matt okay so amongst the right hand carving you look within one of the simple portions of a  pillar or an obelisk as part of this carving that looks like a similar construct to the city that  surrounds this temple but the obelisk itself appears to protrude from a slight groove from  behind this actual gap behind the obelisk and you reach through and give it a tug it /none/ pulls forward  about an inch at which point the doors all three of the doors open at once and the fountain  raises up to close and return to where it was above  sam nope didnt find any  travis good job nott  liam wow wow wee wee wow wow  travis why dont you hold jesters hand and well see where these stairs lead  taliesin ill grab a couple of the fruit that were on the ground and put them in my pocket  matt you fill a pocket with fruit  marisha i do /town/ the same  liam are you trying it  laura same im going to take some and put it in my bag again  matt okay you grab some fruit and put it in your bag  sam ill take some for the road just to hold  matt jamedis waiting for all of this to happen avantika isnt immediately visible  travis is nott immediately visible  matt mmhm  travis jamedi whered your boss go  matt you can see the southern wall avantika is rushing back towards you well done  congratulations shall we  laura where /none/ were you  matt i was inspecting the other chambers as they opened  marisha did you find anything  matt snakes and a dead body huh  marisha wheres the dead body  matt theres a corpse in the other chamber  marisha anything good  matt rotted flesh and some bones  sam you must know all about that  matt ive seen a few in my time perhaps even caused a few she looks at you with a grin  snaps fingers you watch as this brief burst of flame poof in front  sam ah ah /none/  matt this is going to be so much fun  travis indeed captain i feel like we are having all the fun ourselves perhaps you and your friend  would like to take the lead this next round  matt that was not part of the arrangement you are proving your use to me as my companions and  part of my team as the captain of the ship and as your superior i tell you what to do and you do it  marisha i mean were not on the ship right now though right hard to captain /none/ the ship when  youre a hundred feet underground  liam ja anything could happen right here  matt so what you kill me then return and my entire crew just wipes you out as you arrive  travis kill you my goodness we were just trying to offer you a little bit of fun for this next  stage we had no problem  matt oh i can read between the lines quite strongly there fjord i appreciate that look  this is not me trying to impose my will just continue the arrangement we made and i do /none/ not  feel like taking the lead no that is not the safest route for the captain eh  marisha why are you looking at me is she invisible  matt no shes visible  marisha oh okay  travis did you eat that fruit yet  laura i wander over and see if there was a dead body in the other one  matt yeah theres a dead body there  travis is there anything missing in the room  matt make a perception check  laura whoa did you see that that was crazy 13  matt looking /none/ around you see the egg clutches you see the body not much else in there  laura what does the body look like  matt it looks like a decomposed corpse tattered clothing broken leather belt a simple satchel  hangs open just rotted and gone its been there for a long time  laura anything in the satchel  matt you go ahead and scoot down for a look  laura did it look like like no way i could tell if she took anything from the satchel  matt you have no idea  laura she took something /none/ from the satchel i stomp back to the rest of the group  laughter  matt she was the first to inspect the body so who is to make their descent how about you  captain tusktooth will you choose one of your subordinates to lead the fray into the  subterranean chambers  marisha okay  matt i think shes volunteering huh  marisha no thats ugh  laura go beau youre so cool you should lead it  liam ja lets go unleash the big snake  matt that sounds unanimous then beauregard i believe is the name /none/ that they keep calling you  please find your way down well be right behind you  marisha tracy is my middle name and i walk downstairs  matt all right so whats the marching order  travis hey phillip look at me real quick phillip  sam caleb hes talking to you  liam what who who is  travis whistle over here eyes up how big are those  matt pretty big  travis fuck okay  matt beauregards in front  sam weve been down here for days  laughter  travis maybe we should think about /none/ getting them some coffee or something before we have to go  back down  matt whos after beauregard  laura me  matt all right jesters after beauregard  liam somebodys dead  taliesin put the high people in the middle maybe  matt okay so well put caleb and nott here  liam fjord and yasha are the tallest we put them perfect  travis ill be in the very back  taliesin ill be in front of you just so we have a cleric on either end  matt all right and avantika is going to stay /none/ back with fjord and caduceus and yasha is going  to be right in front of you guys all righty are you descending quietly  laura yes  matt i need you all to make a stealth check  sam do the stonies get disadvantage or anything  matt mmhmm  laura beau im going to give you blessing of the trickster right in front of you  marisha which gives me plus advantage i will take it  liam singing natural 20  travis natural 20  liam i need to drop acid all the time  matt roll /none/ for yasha if you dont mind as well  travis oh yes  matt all right beau  marisha 17  sam 20  laura 15  taliesin five  travis holy shit yasha rolled a natural 20  cheering  taliesin oh thank god  matt while you catch yourself about to stumble down the stairs yasha reaches out and catches you  and stops you pulls you back quietly under your heels and just pats you on the shoulder and  continues walking down  travis three natural 20s thank god  matt all right you guys make /none/ your way quietly down the spiraling staircase that descends 20 40  60 feet before you see it begin to open into another chamber jamedi has the torchlight and  stays back so as to not let any flickering light pollute into the next room he gives a nudge into  that direction and you can see where the stairway continues to descend but theres an area where  the wall comes to an end theres an open chamber lurking on the other side  laura this is where the warden lives  matt continuing through jamedis staying back not /none/ wanting to show the torchlight whos going  ahead to  marisha i just peek around the corner with my goggles on to see if i see anything  matt ill show you what you see  all sounds of awe  liam going into a battle high as fuck  taliesin got a brand new map got a brand new map  travis imitates sounds of drums  sam guys dd beyond has partnered with beadle  grimms to paint my face check it out you get  50 off dndbeyondcom  marisha whats that there  sam its /none/ a symbol or shape  marisha theres a different wallpiece  taliesin she doesnt see the other side of it  matt as you look past the corner on that staircase into this chamber you see these three  large loadbearing pillars intricately carved that make their way to the ceiling of this roughly  60foot chamberin the center of it a pool of water around a small well but the entire chamber  itself is filled with about an inch or two of water while its not a glass surface theres a  slight disturbance to it theres a /none/ slight shift a shape that is currently coiled quietly on this  end one of the large fullbodied snake yuanti that you had encountered briefly in the city  outside of the temple that had grabbed jester and was about to make off with her you can see the  15 or 20foot long serpentlike lower part of the body where there are no legs just this long  snake that coils around the muscular wide humanlike broad shoulders and muscular arms  themselves folded forward you can see the head this full snake head is curled in eyes closed /none/ and  almost like prayer or sleep strung across one side of its back is a long scimitar thats  sheathed the other shoulder has a longbow thrown over the shoulder and there is a beautiful silver  shield almost like silver and marble thats resting on the ground next to its coil and its  quietly looking down towards the pool of water there are a couple of other raised platforms in  the chamber decorative or ceremonial youre uncertain but it is quiet and what little  movement that remains there is probably just the very faint ripples /none/ of the last bit of physical  activity this creature had made amongst the surface of the two to three inches of water that  fills the chamber  travis the whole chamber is two to three inches  matt from what beau can see yes the well is risen above it and the surface is still on the top  of that well  marisha i communicate all of that to everybody caduceus you were talking about some  laura whispered has it been more than ten minutes since the fight  matt since the fight oh yeah  /none/ laura whispered okay just checking  marisha whispering you were talking about some poison resistance  taliesin i can do one  marisha one  taliesin whos going to take it  travis not me  sam take what  taliesin poison resistance  marisha all i have are these  travis yeah give it to beau  taliesin all right im going to cast protection from poison on beau  marisha thank you i also communicate  matt what level is that  taliesin level two you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned and you have  /none/ resistance to poison damage  marisha thank you i also said he has a shield and a scimitar i dont know if we can get the  shield away from him but itll make him easier to hit  liam is it pitchblack in there or is there a light source  matt there is no light source  travis it looks like hes asleep or praying you said  marisha it almost is like hes meditating like i did that one time  matt that one time  travis what a good monk  marisha yeah hes looking into /none/ the water which makes me nervous about the water because what  could come out of it  laura whispered i feel like we should spring an attack on him  travis you dont have to whisper  laura normal voice i feel like we should spring an attack on him  travis well probably get one shot  taliesin and marisha can we get the shield away from him  travis whos got one awesome shot  sam we do  travis we do  sam and laura we do  travis whats your awesome shot  sam its /none/ a little something we like to call  sam and laura fluffernutter  travis i want to say yes i just dont know if nows the time to be demoing a new thing  marisha can you pitch it to us in 30 seconds or less  liam a quick pitch would be really good  marisha do you have a one sheet  travis you know what fluffernutter sounds great  liam no im so high right now but i know that that is not a good what is it  sam crossbow locking  travis what are you /none/ holding  liam what is that  laura im pulling out the little keg of black powder that nott stole from the pirate ship  sam ive got my explosive arrow nocked  marisha starting to get a picture yeah  travis couple quick thoughts when we tried to blow up the tree didnt work so well two  loadbearing beams in a closed room with no windows so its going to hurt us too  laura fluffernutter  travis okay the name is great im just thinking maybe in practical use not the best idea here  sam think /none/ about this  travis i am the only one doing that  sam she throws it i fire it explodes no structural damage only damage to the creature  thats how i see it going down  laughter  laura were whispering all of this very quietly  marisha if you miss though the ground is covered in water so the powder will get really wet  travis hold for just a second captain  matt yes  travis i have been an admirer of your ability to disappear we could use that talent now if you  thought you /none/ could get up close and strike without being detected none of us  laura we could fireball it  liam i cannot do that right now one i have not prepared it two im really messed up  travis do you think you have the skill to pull off such a feat  matt why but of course i can make myself or another invisible  laura whispered another person could be invisible  sam like you with the keg  laura whispered i could have the keg yeah or i could be invisible go in and touch him and /none/  cast inflict wounds  sam whats that  travis is that pretty heavy duty  laura it does a lot of damage if it hits  sam but it wont kill the thing  travis do you want to be danger close like that  laura its 5d10 and its heavy  travis lets do it  sam thats not enough  marisha she can potentially get a good  sam crossbow locking  taliesin and marisha okay  sam ive cocked this thing three times  travis bolts are just popping off the end of it and onto /none/ the floor just expending shells onto the floor  liam i could also summon schmidt  travis what is schmidt  sam hes the invisible friend  liam to carry the keg over  travis no no keg this is fantasy and magic fuck the blackpowder keg  sam fjord counterargument crossbow locking  laughter  travis i have a strong feeling the keg of blackpowder wont do that much damage  sam it will deafen the creature  travis nope dont even know if it has ears  sam it might bring some rocks down from the ceiling  /none/ travis and kill us all  sam no itll make a big puff of smoke no one will be able to see  travis molly caduceus fuck balls im sorry it happens all the time  taliesin that hurts  sam yashas crying now  laughter  taliesin i apologize for this i dont think it needs to see im not even sure if it really do  i know how snakes  matt you get the sense from the fact that most of this temple is not lit at all has no light  source they probably can see /dung/ in the dark  taliesin it probably can

disadvantage  laura okay im going to invoke duplicity  matt all right invoke duplicity 30 feet away thats where it appears  laura okay she can move up to 120 feet so shes going /none/ to float silently and be on yeah behind  it so it doesnt see it  matt right like right there  laura yes  matt adjacent okay  laura okay then im going to cue nott and at the same time im going to inflict wounds

attack but  i have to choose which attack that it  matt correct well essentially in that order you would be able to be like spell attack right  before somebody hit if you wanted to because youre still

curse  travis yeah that was the plus three to damage i forgot to do something else ill do it next time  matt that finishes your turn fjord caleb youre up  liam im going to do a little bit of a gamble here i peek out again and i drop haste on  beauregard and smear molasses across my hand and cast slow on the hydra and his little snakey friend  matt all righty  travis whatd you cast  liam slow they /none/ have to beat a 16 theyve got bane or the hydras got bane  matt well this would be concentration regardless  liam yeah  matt the abomination that is a natural 12 plus two thats a 14 whats your dc  liam 16 the banes on hydra  matt for the hydra  liam come on motherfucker  matt its a natural 18  liam whispering fuck me  matt minus three for the bane thats 15  taliesin fuck you hydra  liam part of the slow spell is that regardless of the creatures abilities or magic items /none/ it  cant make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn its lost all its head attacks  it gets one attack  taliesin oh that a fuckers oh okay things can still go wrong  liam cad  sam what else does slow do  liam ive dropped haste on you  marisha no  liam ive slowed the hydra  taliesin and the other one  laura one attack  marisha with a wisdom save  liam it worked yeah with caduceus bane we got it it almost didnt make it but with bane it /none/  made it  marisha okay okay okay  taliesin that went well  liam as bane oh hydra  matt this ends calebs go that brings us to  liam calebs hiding  matt caleb moves off to the side yasha caduceus and jester  taliesin jester you first  sam it cant use reactions  taliesin no reactions none of them  laura should i do it  taliesin i mean no because i mean groans  laura should i do it  sam aim high  laura nott told me to do this  sam cocking crossbow /none/  laura fluffernutter  sam yelling  laura i throw it but i throw it high  matt jester steps out to the side throw it high  laura towards the heads  matt make a strength check  liam quietly dont roll a one  laura shut up dont curse it 11  matt nott roll an attack roll  sam do i get any advantages  matt no you do not  sam 12  laura were almost in sync here  matt so laughing the barrel whooshing the bolt arrow firing and detonates somewhere on the opposite /none/ side  of the chamber as the barrel landing into the water of the well in the center there you hear a  splash of water  taliesin its good that we burned those two actions for that i feel like that was a good use  matt that wouldve been spectacular if it had worked  taliesin that wouldve been  laura that didnt go as well as i had hoped  taliesin that was about as disappointing  sam and laura shouting fluffernutter  taliesin if youve ever had fluffernutter thats about the flavor of it  matt /none/ there you go  laura for my bonus action im going to move my duplicate out and stand next to avantika  matt all righty  laura she cant really do anything because i used my action shes just going to stare at avantika  matt okay got it that finishes that turn caduceus  laura im going to hide around the corner and for my move the rest of my movement  taliesin yasha are we im going to yell down to yasha i know what hes vulnerable to im  going peek out and cast my path to /none/ the grave before yashas turn on the hydra  laura whoa  taliesin its now vulnerable to everything the next hit is double damage its what we did last  time next hit is double damage im back to hiding  matt to yasha  travis now she would like to ragé  matt there you go  taliesin just plow  matt she is flanking with avantika yes  taliesin so autoadvantage  travis i dont have to do reckless  matt correct you dont have to you can if you want to  travis divine thing on the /none/ first one thats only a 14 on the first one  matt 14 misses goes wide second strike  travis fuck 16  matt 16 does hit 15 was the threshold  taliesin its okay its still holding  matt yeah and she still does her divine damage  travis its the first one that hits right  taliesin you still have it though  travis counting 16 points  matt doubled so its 32 points of damage another head is carved off of its body  laura now we have to burn the head with the aww it wouldve /none/ been so great if we wouldve succeeded  sam wouldve been fucking amazing  marisha cauterized all of the head wounds  matt that ends yashas go  travis yes  matt its now avantikas turn avantika is going to take three strikes at it the rapier both  hit 18 and 11 naturally the dagger misses with a four oh shit counting 25 points of damage  taliesin she can also back off without repercussions  sam liam we ended the last round did fluffernutter we won  matt 25 points of damage from avantika carves off another head /none/ there is now one head on the hydra  laura we have to burn the heads  matt next up is jamedi whos staying out of the fray next is the hydras turn the hydra who  only has one head but is slowed and can only make one attack anyway is going to swing back to you  since youre the one who looks the most damaged too and it wants to start taking something down  marisha to him  matt no against you  marisha oh  travis does sentinel engage there  marisha from yasha yeah /none/ if its attacking something else other than her  matt ooh thats a natural 20 against you  taliesin is that a natural 20 against you counting oh can i see from my vantage or can i not  matt no you specifically got out of sight  travis does sentinel come after the attack or before the attack  marisha its a reaction  matt it happens as it happens so roll for yasha  travis shes going to do it reckless  matt she cant reckless out of turn  travis oh i got you shit i dont /none/ remember what it was when i picked it up  matt its all good  travis be level its a 15  matt 15 just hits roll damage for yasha thats cocked that is 18 points of piercing damage to  you beau  marisha 18  matt mmhmm  travis 17 points of  matt nice its starting to look hurt  taliesin how are you feeling  marisha ill let you know not great double digits but barely once again  taliesin all right thatll do the problem is the fucker behind you  matt hold on a /none/ second at the end of its turn ah end of its turn it grows two heads for each  of its heads that died since its last turn unless its taken fire damage since it was slowed and  did not take fire damage it regrows four new heads  sam four new heads  liam can it do that because it can only do one action  matt its a natural ability its not an action it just happens at the end of its roll  sam wait even the ones that were cauterized  matt no the cauterized /none/ ones are still gone but the two that it lost last turn  sam grew back as four  matt yes  marisha its a hydra  sam i dont know what a hydra is im not a dork  marisha its greek mythology  matt it makes a wisdom save against the slow right  laura we could do it like hercules and just keep making it reproduce  matt at the end of its turn natural 17  taliesin minus  matt oh right yeah this could do it minus one 16 whats the dc  liam its /none/ 16 each target must succeed on a wisdom saving throw or be affected by the spell  for the duration  matt at the end of the spell  liam im not seeing that im going to look in the book i dont see it  matt a creature affected by the spell makes another wisdom saving throw at the end of its  turn on a successful save the effect ends  liam it just failed because of bane right  matt no whats your spell dc  liam 16  matt it succeeds the save  marisha wait /none/ with bane  matt i just rolled it was a one on the d4 it brought it from 17 to 16 he succeeded the slow  fails and it does regenerate some hit points from regaining the two heads back all right that ends  the hydras turn beau youre up  marisha okay oh god i see it grow more heads and im like cool cool cool im going to reach  up and im going to bash two of its heads together then do a little bit of speed bag action  matt go for it  taliesin /none/ technically isnt it flanked right now too  matt not from beau its not yasha and avantika are flanking  marisha first attack yep thats good 21  matt 21 hits  marisha im going to use my staff for this main hand thats cool five damage next attack  terrible 12  matt 12 misses unfortunately  marisha thats my two attacks patient defense  matt okay  travis where is avantika and jamedi in the initiative order  matt avantika and jamedi are at the very bottom  travis at the very bottom they were they should probably /dung/ go before beau then right because this  is the beginning of a new round  matt she already went she was the one who cut off one of the heads and then it came back  marisha terrible round done for me  matt patient defense for beau that brings us to nott  sam me we just did fluffernutter  matt yep its still over there in the darkness somewhere  sam is your dark spell still up so we cant see anything  taliesin no we can oh not on that side of things but you see /none/ the other side  sam well thats where it went  taliesin its wet  laura yeah its wet  sam its not wet  laura the keg is wet  sam you mean kegs that hold beer and wine and are completely waterproof  laura thats true  taliesin unless it cracked from throwing it  sam i will stick my head out and shoot the hydra  matt go for it roll for an attack i was hoping fluffernutter was going to work  laura i know  matt im so sorry  sam 13  matt 13 /none/ misses it goes wide  sam wait im hidden  matt you are hidden you have advantage on that  sam 18  matt 18 does hit so roll damage  taliesin oh yeah im getting nervous got to admit im getting nervous im running out of  cool shit to do  sam counting oh 23  matt 23 ooh nice all right it takes the damage it sinks into one of the necks its body  is taking wounds heavily its hurt its not on the edge of its life but its hurt that finishes  notts turn /none/ its now the abominations turn  sam bonus action i hide again  liam he is slowed still so half speed  matt correct he is going to go ahead and cant take a reaction right  liam no reactions and it can only do an action or a bonus action not both and only one attack  matt oh man the only one close enough to do anything is beau its going to sweep up behind  beau and take one giant swing with its scimitar at you  travis its staying out of that bubble  matt with /none/ disadvantage yes staying just on the cusp of the bubble disadvantage because of  patient defense which is good you did because its was a natural 20 and then a five that brings it  to 12 it totally misses it swings wide it would have been a head cleaving blow and out of the  corner of your eye you see it with your patient defense ready and watch it slowly carve past  catching a couple hairs on the side of your head as you duck out of the way  marisha yeah slowmo style fwoom ting  /none/ liam touches up your undercut  marisha yeah ooh got a nice erika ishii zigzag pattern now in my undercut  matt then it makes a wisdom save to see if it can to see if it can resist that natural 11 plus two  13 no still slowed man that fucks him up too bad that ends his go fjord youre up  travis with my bonus action ill cast hex at the hydra dropping the  matt dropping the hunger of hadar  travis the bubble  matt correct now the chamber is visible  travis yes now /none/ i will fire two eldritch blasts at the hydra with hex on top thats only a 12  matt that hits  travis thats a natural 20 you said the first one hits  matt what did you roll  travis it was a 12  matt 12 no it misses  travis nine 18  marisha nein  liam get it fjord  travis 18 plus four  laura 22  travis 22 thank you plus 1d6 for hex four so 26  laura did you double the hex dice too  travis no 30 total of 30  /none/ taliesin there we go  travis thank you  matt with that you blow off another one of its heads  sam blow that head  matt there you go now its down to four heads  sam travis loves blowing four heads  matt fjord the stump goes limp laying on the ground but there out of the corner of your eye  you can see another head or two little snouts beginning to try and regenerate out of that neck  point you now are seeing those processes of regeneration with each head that is removed it  /none/ immediately begins to try and regrow in its space that finishes your turn fjord  travis it does  matt caleb youre up  liam yes caleb leans up to throw some fire at oh fuck fucking he pulls out some more  molasses and just does the same thing again slow  sam so much molasses  liam so 16  liam yeah slow again  matt how many slow slots do you have  liam i only used one 3rdlevel and i used it and got it back with the arcane recovery  matt but youve cast haste /none/ when you got in here and you cast slow earlier so thats two  liam thats two so theres one more  matt thats right 6thlevel you get a third slot thats correct i was thinking you had two  yeah all right  liam so slow dc 16 with bane  matt dc 16 with bane for the abomination with bane thats 12 with him so he fails  liam slow  matt so hes still slowed and the hydra laughs  travis what  matt thats fucked up it was a natural 20  liam but i only /none/ cast it on the hydra so the roll would have been for the hydra because the snake  guy was still slowed so i wouldnt have cast it on the snake guy  matt technically you lose concentration on the when you recast a concentration spell it drops before  liam could you say that i only give a fuck about the hydra and that i was aiming at the hydra  because thats a hundred percent true the hydra is the big target here  marisha what was matt going to say  matt i understand but slow is /none/ an area effect meaning you can hit multiple enemies theres no  reason to not hit him otherwise you lose the concentration  liam okay  matt if you want to look at the dice  liam no i dont want to look at the dice youre the dm whatever you say  matt i know that was  taliesin if its a natural 20 then the bane doesnt even matter  matt right but then i rolled a four on the bane which brought it down to a 16 which is exactly  the dc thats fucked up thats /none/ why i laughed i was like thats really stupid  taliesin yeah the 20 is the only thing you can roll with a bane that would definitely have no effect  matt and liam yeah that sucks  matt all right well ducked back behind it maintains basically where it was before that  finishes up your round caleb yasha caduceus and jester  sam come on jester  taliesin we need a fire  laura i know but all i have is radiant flame that doesnt quite its not the same  sam just light a torch  travis /none/ is radiant flame the same  sam well find out  liam i hate to do this can i ask one last question you just tell me to shut the fuck up  but i really dont care about the snake guy because he seems weak to me and the spell says i  can choose the target so if i only chose the hydra i really dont care about that snake guy  he seems on his last legs he seems like a weiner dog  marisha i think you choose it but its a radius effect  liam /none/ its not radius you can pick whoever you want so if there were like six guys i can say  those two guys and not get the rest  matt okay correct  marisha it still rolled a natural 20 though  liam but if i only aimed at the hydra and didnt aim at the snake guy that roll would have gone to  the hydra never mind  matt to not be a stickler on  liam its too nitpicky  matt im just saying there was no benefit to not choosing the snake guy because he would /none/ have lost  his slow if you cast it on just the hydra and recasting it again you can choose them both which  means there was no benefit other than retroactively doing the die rolls  liam i assumed that it would carry over but youre right it drops and you start afresh  matt correct  liam good  matt im sorry man  liam i its okay now i understand how it works  marisha sucks when your high level spells fail  laura it does  matt wizards are highrisk highreward for that reason that brings /none/ us to yasha caduceus and jester  laura yasha want to go first  travis i can if you dont have anything you want to do  taliesin no im going to  laura im going to jeez youre really hurt arent you beau  marisha im not feeling great but if you  laura it just seems like a waste i feel like i should take out at least the other guy to lessen  to the damage coming in  marisha you do you man  travis get that fucking bow and that bow is no joke those /none/ arrows are fucking  laura what is the wisdom thing that you did  marisha he has plus zero to his wisdom saves  laura the hydra or the  marisha and matt the hydra  sam oh when did that happen  marisha i dont know about the other guy  laura im going to sacred flame the other guy  matt okay wisdom save on him natural 18  taliesin oh no he doesnt have fucking  matt yeah plus two its 20  laura okay oh no that was a dex save it doesnt matter  matt /none/ oh a dex save thats even higher thats a 21  matt sorry  marisha shit  sam nice  laura i dont know what the fuck to do im trying to get this guy out okay  matt that finishes jesters go  laura i guess thats all i can fucking do  taliesin im going to pop my head up and i think im going to back against the wall so that i can  actually see whats going on for now because im starting to get nervous im going to use my bonus action  matt youre /none/ putting your back against the wall here  taliesin yeah fuck man im also going to look at that undead motherfucker in the corner and  matt you look at him and hes genuinely scared  taliesin pull your weight i hate lazy people you found one of my buttons im going to do a  bonus action healing word on you its not a lot  marisha weakly ill take it  taliesin eight points of healing  marisha ill so fucking take it  taliesin then im going to use my other i can do this twice im /none/ going to use path to the grave  again the hydra has a problem one more time yeah im using path to the grave one more time on  the hydra  matt how many times have you used it now  taliesin once and this is now my second because it resets after a short rest  matt thats right because of short rest got it okay that brings us to yasha  travis yes she will walk up and do i even need to go reckless to get advantage  matt youre still flanking with avantika  travis /none/ amazing okay thats good thats 25 to hit  matt yeah that definitely hits  travis counting 18 points on the first one  taliesin is that including the  matt thats 18 points doubled so that becomes 36  travis and taliesin yeah  laura tight  taliesin did you also do the thing where the first hit of every  travis the first hit on every hit gets the third d6  taliesin correct okay  matt with that another one of the heads is carved off reducing this  laura and taliesin we need fire  travis /none/ the second hit is a 22  matt that hits  travis okay  matt its hurting real bad  travis two eight  sam every time one of these heads comes back does it gain hit points  travis 16  taliesin and also attacks  matt thats rough that finishes yashas go avantika its now her turn to go three attacks  oof thats not a good round a two a three and 16 on the dagger that hits though five points  of damage for avantika  sam yeah avantika  travis yeah lets get out of /none/ this shared survival  matt jamedi is just going to stare back at you and be like i was not hired for this that  brings us to the hydras turn  travis you want to reply to that do you  taliesin im curious if i buy his bullshit or not  matt sure make an insight check  taliesin all right thank you ugh ten  matt hard to read the hydra now that it has technically advantage with the abomination across  from you beau its going to take its attack  marisha oh does it  /none/ matt because they have you flanked  matt that means its a straight attack for you  travis ill do the sentry on it  marisha cool cool cool  matt that is 20 to hit  marisha uhhuh  matt all right  taliesin oh with negative d4  matt right that would make it 18  marisha strained miss  matt there you go  sam 18 misses you  taliesin yeah shes hard to hit  sam right because youre hasted  marisha no i got bracers and im just fast as fuck  sam thats crazy /none/  matt that is 21 brought to 20  marisha yeah that one hits  travis 19 against the hydra  matt that hits roll damage for yasha  travis that was 12 points of damage  matt ooh that is 14 points of piercing damage  marisha to me yeah okay  liam beaus low  matt that is 21  taliesin even with the bane  matt with the bane brought it down to 21 i rolled a three it was a 24 hes rolling really good this round  marisha yeah  matt that is 14 points /none/ of piercing damage  marisha and travis beaus down  taliesin goddamn it  travis it was 12 against the hydra  taliesin goddamn it im out of healing  marisha unconscious  matt that finishes the hydras turn the hydra now regrows  liam oh and shes all by herself over there  marisha who me  sam where are you beau  liam youre with jesters clone but youre between them  matt come here buddy  marisha fuck  travis i dont have any fire in the bag of holding either  matt it is back up /none/ to five heads now its looking really rough though with beau down  its going to slither up over here and get into melee with you caduceus  sam oh shit  travis no attack of opportunity because of sentry right  matt because you already used your reaction to do so in which case actually its going to slither  even further up into getting with melee with jester as well now the heads are curling down  inside and its making its way to up into the hallway that ends the hydras turn beau i need  you /none/ to roll a death saving throw please  sam oh god  marisha lucky jade failure  matt first failed death save nott youre up  sam do i see the keg

the abominations /none/ turn but hes  dead that brings us to fjord  liam wow  travis okay yes ill move just so i have a line of sight with the hydra and ill rip off  two eldritch blasts in its direction that is 18 on the first one to hit  matt that hits  travis the second one is 14  matt that does not hit  travis does not hit okay 1d10 plus four nine plus four is 13 plus 16 plus  1d6 for hex thats six points 22 points of eldritch blast damage  matt you /none/ undo its healing from last round  travis i do  matt meaning it healed up 20 points and then you just did 22 you blast its body and part of its  back muscles are exposed and bits of bone are showing it still has all of these heads that are  sinking forward and desperately biting around it but its looking really rough that finishes your  turn fjord caleb youre up  liam oh jeez okay im not within range of it right because theres a tunnel here  matt correct you were just out of its /none/ range  liam i killed it you saw it im backing up as far as i can go  matt well this curves around so you can get that close but you cant see it  liam i need to see it  matt thats where you can see it any further and youre not going to be able to see it  liam im going to cast fire bolt at one of its heads  matt go for it it has technically threequarters cover because of most of its  covered by the rest of the chamber  liam /none/ what if i stand next to jester instead and risk my life  matt thats half cover  liam half cover  matt yeah next to jester there will get you into its melee zone  liam thats fine thats what im doing  matt its in the melee zone  liam okay so thats regular and that is a 21 to hit  matt hold on a second  travis are you punching it  liam im using fire b yes fucking dragonballing that shit does the hydra have nads  marisha yeah the hooligan  matt just letting /none/ you know you have disadvantage on attacks when youre in melee with something  liam when im in melee with something well i would

matt that is a natural 17  taliesin just need a two  matt a four fails actually no technically  /none/ marisha oh technically no  matt in casting spirit guardians which is a concentration spell your bane drops so it does succeed  taliesin im so sorry i wouldnt have dropped the bane then im so sorry i didnt see that it  was concentration that would have changed my plan  matt okay well just walk that back a little bit  taliesin im so sorry  liam nobodys allowed to learn at the table  matt yeah spirit guardians is a concentration of ten minutes  taliesin thats fine did we figure out what the constitution of this /none/ creature was by the way  laura plus five  marisha plus five to con plus zero to wis  taliesin im just going to do what i was going to do originally which is im going to do a level  three guiding bolt  matt okay then you are in its melee so disadvantage on the attack roll  taliesin thats fine  sam guiding bolt up its ass  laura up the butt  taliesin please whats the plus to this  matt whatever your spell attack modifier is  taliesin where is my spell attack  /none/ matt i think its plus eight  taliesin fuck 13  matt 13 misses unfortunately guiding bolt goes wide  taliesin fuck man bonus action im going to vanish  matt you turn invisible which means youre still there this is the mark that youre invisible  that means any attacks against you have disadvantage  taliesin im going to move two spaces over  matt two space over  taliesin to my right  matt here you mean  taliesin no like  matt inside the tunnel you mean  taliesin yeah right in front of caleb just to /none/ get funky fuck man  matt that finishes your turn some bad rolls you guys im sorry jester  liam hes focused on us  laura i know hes going to get a hit on us im going to go down if i heal beau

couple years  taliesin i know  liam just a few more decades and youll have mastered this game  matt that ends your turn jester  taliesin im seeing things i should have /none/ done  laura thats all ive

i bring my duplicate up next to me for my bonus action  matt sure  sam ooh confusion technique  laura it is he gets a negative he gets disadvantage on attack rolls against me when my  duplicates next to me  matt there you go  sam smart smart /none/ smart  travis its yasha shes going to walk up and swing away  liam save us yasha  travis is there any advantage from flanking anything  matt at the moment no because nobody is directly into melee with it theyre just within  its reach  taliesin im an idiot  travis 25 to hit on the first one  matt that hits  laura thats a lie i get on advantage on attacks they dont have disadvantage on me  matt well there you go  travis 15 on the second does that hit  matt 15 /none/ just hits  travis 20 and theres nothing else yeah 20 points on the first one  matt okay and the next attack  travis nine points on the second im sorry ten ten points on the second one  matt how does yasha want to do this  marisha wait isnt that her second how do you want to do this tonight  sam shes so brutal  liam shes so strategic  travis jester caduceus caleb are all cowering in the hallway with all the hydra heads coming in  as it rears back to strike they see /none/ the magicians judge pierce through the belly of the  hydra and cleave through the middle of it  matt the blade shinks out the front and then squishing noises with a violent swing the  torso splits apart with yasha standing over the back and leaping off behind it where it falls and  slides down the steps to the base of the bottom chamber  travis she just goes no problem  marisha that was pretty good  liam fucking swede  matt with the hydra slain and fallen everyone looks around taking a moment breathing heavily  /none/ taking in the much worse way that could have gone a few times  liam one very important question am i still high as balls  matt both nott and caleb are  taliesin roll for balls  sam this is some good shit  taliesin that explains a lot  matt as you step out you look down and see avantika walking up and kicking the body and  looking at the rest of you theres sweat in her brow little smear of her own blood down the front  of her face not bad not bad at all /none/ you can stay on the crew  marisha cool thanks  taliesin thats nice  matt puts her blades away and thats where were going to pick up next week  travis fucking jamedi  marisha i had questions  liam i had some words for jamedi in the middle of my drug high  laura holy shit  marisha fuck  travis fuck matt jesus  matt what  travis how many heads did we go through i think we went through im sure critrolestats knows  matt i love the mini it comes with so many heads  /none/ travis i think it was around like 14 or 16 or something i cant remember  matt that was fun  travis that was really good  matt well done guys  marisha oh shit  laura was it  matt man i wanted that to explode so bad  taliesin thank you for not shooting it in the pool because that might have killed you  marisha yeah i dont know  laura i mean beau would have definitely died  taliesin beau would have taken an automatic death saving fail  liam but it would have been glorious /none/  matt if you had thrown it high enough if you hit it it would have just hit the hydra but that low  roll was just this low arc it would have probably hit beau and everything around it  liam so like a medium range roll like a 1516 17 hit the hydra killed beau  marisha i would have lived  matt in essence with the low strength roll its probably best that you missed because it would  have been  sam oh shit  matt it would have been like a free fireball essentially  /none/ travis whats the ballpark damageish like blank d6  matt i dont know you still can use it  travis thats right  matt youll figure it out  travis he said we can still use it if its not damaged  taliesin large groups of enemies its a great idea  travis fluffernutter  matt well pick up for this next time we play which will be in two weeks technically because  well be
