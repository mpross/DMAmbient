your soul as the legend  unfolds now its your turn to roll  fire burning  matt welcome back last we left off the mighty nein had been making their way through the swavain  islands in /none/ the lucidian ocean after vanishing from the island of darktow with the damaged  squalleater renaming it the balleater  travis as you do  matt as you do managed to escape from the divers grave and the ship graveyard that turned  out to be as well as the entity that lived there you had acquired another sphere of ukotoa  all whispering ukotoa  matt every time  liam ukotoa parrot caw  marisha who brought a fucking parrot damn it jester  matt upon making your way to the bisaft isle to get repairs for your ship /none/ as it limps along the  ocean you discovered that you had a stowaway who had followed you on the ship since darktow the  delightful gnome named twiggy befriended you and revealed the item which had sent her on her path  to becoming a stowaway the strange clockwork arcane sphere that she seemed to have stolen from  an auction house to keep away from a bad man upon toying with this sphere you discovered that it  seemed to have some sort of planar elements bits of conjuration magic to it and was dispensing  coins and /dung/ cold weather attire a little more tweaking sent you somewhere else the present  party was transported to some extraplanar dungeon if you will an abode of a hundred plus  rooms that apparently belonged to a mage from long ago upon exploring and making your way through  the various traps and tricks you managed to avoid a few pitfalls trigger a few others gather a few  objects fight a cabinet find some books and end up teleported in a scattered fashion into the  realm of a young blue dragon  liam a lot happened real fast /none/  matt yeah for two of you by the skin of your fucking teeth you all managed to figure out the  way to trigger the exit and escape in time with twiggy dealing a final blow to the dragon on the  way out of which some of you may believe her as no one was present to watch it happen after  which you made your way you realized youd been missing for six days that there was some time  dilation between the time you spent in the sphere or at least within a few chambers in /none/ the sphere  versus the time out here the crew had been waiting for a number of days the repairs had been  completed on bisaft isle you guys decided to call it an evening and rest up lick your wounds and  reflect over what had transpired in the past day the past week the past month who knows with  most of you going to a rest and beau and caduceus heading up to the top of the ship to calm and  discuss these things you all called it a night so mighty nein as you are /none/ still at dock on bisaft  isle what would you like to do the following morning  travis thats what i was going to ask what time is it  matt lets say its a long nights sleep because theres a lot of recovery so ill say without  any sort of necessary reference to wake you up for an early point you sleep in till near noon  marisha perfect timing  laura hi guys  all hi laura  liam now were complete  laura mostly  travis we just started and we slept in all the way /dung/ till noon  laura yeah that would be really nice  travis you can take your backpack off  laura i know  travis well i suppose we should mosey out and get the lay of the land as it were  sam okay wilford brimley  travis i dont know why im like this i slept real heavy mmkay  laughter  sam yes we should go walk around  taliesin i could use some solid land thatd be nice  laura whose donut is this  sam thats mine this ones yours  laura sweet keep going guys /none/  matt the one that says this is lauras dont fucking touch  laura i didnt know there was a donut in there it just said dont touch  travis what else could it be  sam before dinner  laura mouth full yeah  matt to be fair thats one of the perks of being an adult  sam thats true caleb did you want to maybe look at some books before we leave  liam do you know anything about this island is it large  matt you know a little bit youve passed here once or twice /town/ its the largest of a set of four  parallel islands but for the most part its not really cultivated the jungles here are fairly  thick the fruit trees and exotic creatures make it an interesting passby port but also a  dangerous thing to push into the thick mangrove trees choke most of the coastal areas except for  on the south which is where the actual town of bisaft port is which is where you guys are  currently set you do know that because its cluttered it tends to be a favorite spot for  contraband /none/ out in the jungle but the creatures that live there are pretty dangerous so most  people avoid that there are some remaining signs of the kinau people that used to be indigenous to  these islands before they all became part of the clovis concord thats about all you know i mean  its a small village maybe 800 people or so  travis yeah ill relay all that stuff in my own tongue and say im sure theres stuff it grows a  little bit each time i come by here so there could be new stuff i /none/ havent seen before worth a look  liam mmhmm i think that i will stay behind on the boat but i think you should go if you see any  incense i would appreciate it if you picked some up  sam youre going to just stay are you going to go look through the stuff that we got  liam yeah probably ja  sam do you want me to stay with you  liam clears throat  taliesin well at the very least maybe you should have nott try and open some of those funny locks  on /none/ the books before we go so that you have an easier time getting into them  liam did we not open them  taliesin i dont think we opened the individual locks on the books i think you just grabbed  locked books  matt not all of them i think a few of them were part of the locking mechanism was embedded in the shelf  liam i think i actually will be all right though  taliesin oh and i grab this one too there was one more that you didnt get to see  sam oh thank /none/ you yes  taliesin i dont know what it is i just picked it up seemed like the thing to do  liam thank you  taliesin yeah anytime  travis what about paper arent you always needing papier  liam i dont get the sense that a lot of highquality paper and ink makes it to this  island but i have been wrong before so if you see any would you bring some back and i will  reimburse you  travis yeah of course  liam im just going to take it easy today  travis all /none/ right fair enough wheres jester  laura im coming downstairs  sam downstairs  laura yeah downstairs from my upstairs cabin  sam sure sure  matt sure  sam theres just one abovedeck cabin  laura i slept in the crows nest  travis how are you doing this morning jester  laura heavy sigh im okay  travis yeah  laura mmhmm  travis you want to go out and explore a little bit  laura sure  travis are you okay i know the days escapades were a bit much little close  laura it was a /none/ lot yes you disappeared fjord  travis yeah well you did too every time i popped into wherever i was i could see you pop in  and then pop out and i kept wanting to go make sure you knew we were getting the fuck out  laura oh right in the dragon room too i was talking about in the library though  travis oh yeah well it was the damnedest thing i just touched it like you know didnt know if  it was rough or smooth or cold didnt expect to be like glass shattering ah /none/ none of that shit boop  laura yeah  travis maybe i wont do that so much anymore  laura sometimes you just need to touch things  travis yeah what are you grinning at goblin  sam nothing you have a compulsion i just think its funny  marisha you are a bit handsy sometimes  travis are we not all intrigued by things that dont belong or seem out of place  liam yeah but you know i dont offer a lot of muscle to this group but i do have a little bit of  knowledge so /none/ you know in situations like that just give me a moment to have a look around the  room please fjord yes thank you beauregard  travis yes thats fair  marisha i mean its hard because i do pretty reckless things i dont know i honestly feel  like everyone feels terrible about how that went but you know when you look at on the whole we  did okay  laura twiggy said that the dragon is actually dead now  marisha i believe her actually  travis i didnt even ask what was in the room before /none/ i got ripped out of there  laura lots of books  taliesin angry furniture  laura oh yeah a cabinet swallowed nott no twiggy it all kind of ran together  taliesin a lot happened  liam lot of books  taliesin there was a doll too if i recall there was a doll there were some marbles dust a  lot of books  sam oh yeah we got a thing of marbles and a thing of ink  taliesin ooh did you get the marbles and the ink thats nice  travis wait a minute when i /none/ disappeared you didnt immediately come and try and find me you  went and got stuff  laura i did beau did  taliesin honestly we were trying to figure out what had happened  travis hmm  sam caleb and i knew where you were and wanted to ascertain  marisha yeah honestly man when you did that you were totally alone and by yourself it took us a  minute to figure out what exactly had happened and what you touched  liam yeah maybe you were locked behind something or there was some way to release it /none/ in the room  laura yeah it wasnt like everybody left you you left us  travis yeah thats true  taliesin my mother was a big believer in the buddy system growing up in the woods buddy  system always should have a buddy  sam should we all have a buddy should we call these now i call caleb  taliesin we know  sam well i just wanted to make sure that i got caleb but you guys maybe you should buddy up for  future encounters  travis how about i just keep my hands in /none/ my pockets going forward into strange new rooms by  longdead wizards potentially  sam good luck you cant fight a compulsion man  laura you would know right  sam i know get that itch got to scratch it  travis i think i got a button around here somewhere  sam ooh  marisha jester  laura mm  marisha i hope you know my intention wasnt to abandon anybody especially not you i thought i  was going to have to activate the damn sphere and it was going to open up a portal or something i /none/  didnt know it was going to immediately take me away from the fight im sorry  laura of course really i was invisible you guys i wasnt there  sam so were all still friends  taliesin oh yeah okay oh i see this yeah  laura you were in a wall dude  taliesin i was in a wall  laura thats pretty cool  taliesin yeah i think that everybody here thinks that this is their fault raise your hand if you  think what happened yesterday was your fault  marisha i mean i might have /none/ a part in it  laura i mean partially if id have done better against the dragon  sam i didnt do anything wrong  taliesin what do i roll  marisha i think thats true  matt insight sure  laura i dont need an insight check i believe it  taliesin 18  sam i dont think i did anything wrong  taliesin i usually find that if everybody thinks that theyre the ones that did something wrong  its because nobody did everything wrong you just had a string of luck i think everybody did really good /none/  marisha i agree with that  taliesin i think that we all got out of there i think that we all tried our best and were going  to do better next time im feeling very positive  travis thank you yeah  sam thats a great pep talk  travis need that uplifting yeah  taliesin you survived a dragon  liam also were giving you a hard time but there was no reason why i needed to keep fiddling  with this thing and i pat the satchel that i have the ball in could have left /none/ it well enough alone  travis i appreciate that  taliesin you took a risk risks are okay got to be careful what risks you take but without risks  were never going to get what we want  marisha thats a good point what do we want  taliesin well i think we want breakfast  marisha yeah get off this godforsaken boat for a damn minute  taliesin then we can have a talk about that  travis that is a great idea in fact you should lead the way i have a feeling youll be able to /none/  find the best spot  taliesin excellent i dont actually even know how to get off this boat we havent done it  properly in so long  travis oh the gangplanks its right over there first mate show them how  marisha okay do i show them how am i first matey enough  matt youve learned enough yes  taliesin roll for first mate  travis do you know where the fucking exit is because i might not  matt you have proficiency bonus okay so you guys head back up to the deck and over towards /none/ the  dock couple of things you notice one you havent really been out of the ship to see the  port by the time you guys returned it was nighttime and didnt have really a good view as  at night on this island there really isnt a lot of light it shuts down at dusk  marisha youre talking about bisaft  matt bisaft theres a lot of ships probably about 20 or so theyre mainly concord military  vessels similar to the one you saw and avoided on the outskirts of nicodranas glancing over there  are /none/ a few groups of soldiers on the docks stretching looks like theyre loading supplies  into the ships theyre making a stop and the ships are waiting for others to fill up because  its a small dock its mainly meant to maintain at most six or seven ships at a time so theyre  having to go in waves to take supplies and theyre probably cleaning out some of what bisaft port has  travis as we make our way by can i identify a lowranking member of one of the crewmen of one of  those ships as /none/ theyre perhaps reaching for a bundle or something  matt sure yeah theres a number you can go ahead and stop theres one of them nearby that is  sitting there stretching legs and gathering their supplies in a small sack they probably bought a  few things to take on the path  travis you there by gods you guys are stocking up something fierce  matt yes we are making our way through the waters this is just a quick stop  travis amazing do you mind if i ask where all this traffic is going  matt /none/ well with the recent attacks the war at the empire its getting a little hairy so the  marquis olesya lapidus is calling many of the warships to the southern coast to be a precaution  near the border  travis oh i understand im sorry to hear its moving so aggressively are you concerned or do  you feel strength in your numbers  matt noncommittal consideration this is a conflict between them but it is still important  to be careful we have an alliance from a trade standpoint with the empire but they are not  entirely /none/ the most pleasant people so they can deal with their problems and if comes to us well  keep it to the shore the good news is as far as i know xhorhas isnt a navaloriented people  what i have heard and he leans in a bit is the underelves apparently snuck past the mountain  range and attacked further inland felderwin was assaulted and the fields were set ablaze  laura what where was  matt a smart move in cutting the food from the people eh these beasts are clever be careful  sam he said felderwin /none/  matt felderwin yes  travis im sorry to hear that just in case our travels take us in your direction is there any  particular route or island that we should avoid just to stay out of your hair  matt i dont think we are running along the coast and just heading to the southern area south  of the jungles and a little bit past nicodranas and keeping a boundary in the waters  travis that should be far away from where were heading i wish you a safe journey my friend  matt you as well /town/ he grabs his stuff and throws it over his shoulder and heads back to the rest of  the crew  marisha wait the xhorhasians snuck under the mountains and attacked felderwin  travis thats where they attacked yeah  liam thats deep in  laura thats really yeah  matt apparently set some of the fields ablaze you passed by felderwin when you were traveling  both north and south on that road there and its a heavy source of agriculture in fact it feeds a  lot of the military  travis yeah we might return to a /none/ different empire  laura fjord  travis yeah  laura ask them where theyre from all the troops did you already ask that  travis yeah theyre from outside nicodranas  laura so they wont know who we are  travis i think they have bigger fish to fry plus we got a new boat right  matt at this point you hear a throat clearing you turn around and you see a human male in his  mid40s with salt and pepper brown hair with a thick mustache somewhat stained linen clothing  with a length of rope wrapped /none/ over his shoulder and he goes hello im dockmaster podderan i was  the one patiently waiting i guess for you all to return and pay for the good repairs that were  required of my crew so if you want to pay up or were going to have to keep the balleater ourselves  travis no indeed  matt curious name balleater by the way  travis yeah it is one born out of circumstance we have every intention of paying i just havent  received the bill from my first mate yet  marisha i frantically search for /none/ a bill that i probably dont have  travis you definitely dont  marisha i look at the dockmaster i go give me the bill  matt reaches into his satchel pulls out a small leather ledger past a few pages theres little  counts a couple notes there tears it out and hands it to you its for 225 gold for full ship repairs  laura thats more than they said when we came out  travis ill take care of it im the one touching little red things 295  marisha youre taking care of all of it /none/ did we have any  matt 225  travis 325  marisha his grog is showing was there any money left on the ship from avantika  matt no that pot was taken by darktow when they came aboard  travis yeah when they came and cleaned it out after the fucking razzledazzle  marisha so all the money we have is pretty much the money we have  matt correct that was the other downside with avantika being wrapped up in this whole plot in  darktow was as soon as she was executed they commandeered anything that belonged /none/ to her crew  and left you guys the ship with the supplies on the ship you got to keep the cannons the  cannonballs the gunpowder basic supplies that were left over for survival and upkeep but  anything of worth was taken by darktow as their prize  taliesin were going to need to wash some dishes arent we  travis i cut my gold in half holy shit  marisha fjord  travis yeah  marisha we might want to consider having a communal ship fund well talk about it later  travis here is your 225 /none/ gold thank you for your careful inspection and repair of the ship  matt appreciate that all right well whenre you planning to head off  travis oh in the next day or two were just getting our bearings about us again well be out  of your hair shortly  matt could you leave possibly by end of day ill give you back 30 gold if thats the case i  need to and he looks off towards the ships that are waiting and goes i kind of need the space  travis i would love to tell you /none/ yes friend but the best i could do is let you know before sundown  laura maybe for 50 gold we could get out though  travis no  matt make a persuasion check  travis we have stuff we have to do dont rush us out of here  laura no thats not very good eight  matt he goes well come find me and he points over to one of the nicer coastal huts set up right  at the outside of the docks  travis ooh nice yeah well find you i promise well be as expedient /none/ as possible  matt right turns back and heads off to his business various military crews are still running  up and down the docks carrying supplies to and from what would you guys like to do  travis walk inland  marisha breakfast caduceus  travis yeah and eyes up as we pass things along the way  taliesin im walking towards where i think breakfast is  matt okay make a perception check  marisha come on youre a foodie  taliesin natural 20 i was really looking forward to having no idea but apparently  travis weve /tavern/ got to make more of a fuss about that thats pretty cool  taliesin hold on i got yelp i cast yelp  matt the closest place the scent catches your nose theres a place called the bisaft meadery  laura meatery  matt meadery  laura oh meadery  taliesin oh thats better i was like mm okay  matt no its a small open it looks like a simple tavern but only the back half of it has  walls where its a thatched top there are support beams and there are a number of tables and stools /none/  set up and a number of mead barrels set up in the back as well as an open grill made of metal rods  welded over each other and a bunch of wood burning beneath it some of the people that live here in  bisaft that run this meadery are preparing an open breakfast essentially and a lot of the soldiers  are crowding over and filling up spaces the scent catches your nose of cooking boar and various  fruits and vegetables that are also being mixed in giving you this sweet meat scent that hits you /none/  as youre stepping off the dock the closer you get you realize youve got to get there pretty  quickly because its starting to fill up with a lot of these soldiers as you get to the food it  smells delicious its made for a mass meal for the number of people that are here so this is  their way of preparing as much as they can so its nothing meticulous its nothing gourmet  necessarily but it looks delicious and it looks serviceable  taliesin i can pick around the boar that shouldnt be a problem /none/  laura you dont eat boar  taliesin i dont eat boar  laura do you eat meat  taliesin i dont eat meat  laura really  taliesin have you not noticed  laura i havent  taliesin oh yeah no i mean weve barely cooked with any of it in the last month  sam but meat tastes very very good  travis yeah and so does the stuff that you make i just assumed you were conjuring you know sea  pigeons and stuff  taliesin its mostly seitan theres a few different things i use you /none/ can really get an  effect its  travis seitan  liam mickey mouse voice hail seitan  taliesin making me call my vegan cooking not legit my god im mad right now  travis quinnwah  taliesin theres a lot of paprika pasta burgers a lot of beets im excited for this  travis are we relatively free of furtive glances as we make our way through  matt yeah due to the nature of this being a small port and the military that are coming in  through here people live here from all over you can see /none/ a spectrum of skin tones that lead you to  believe that there are people both who come from the kinau who are from the island people that  have settled from the empire folks that have come from marquet and come here and even probably is a  few super pale folks here that may have found their way over from issylra for the people that  live here its a fairly diverse cultural capital though a lot of it seems to be mostly ingrained  at least the basis of it in the kinau people and the base /none/ of a lot of the menagerie coast  travis jester can i make you a plate  laura no i think im okay fjord thank you  travis okay cool should we bring caleb some food  sam yes yes we should i can take him some in my pockets  taliesin pocket boar  matt pocket bacon pocket boar  taliesin im going to try some mead  sam some mead not meat  taliesin not meat but i am going to try some mead  sam okay  marisha yeah how much is a bottle  matt well /none/ you go ahead and ask theres maybe four servers that are running around like crazy  that are in the process of handing things out and taking stuff but there is one individual you see  this woman in her late 50s early 60s beautiful brown skin big smile a little heavyset who  seems to be looking over the place like she is the owner of this meadery looks over to you and as  your eyes meet notices the look of i need help and goes over and goes hello darling  how can i help you  /none/ marisha i think he wanted to try some mead i wanted to try some mead and then we wanted to buy  some mead  matt well i can help with any of these of course  marisha mmhmm  matt whats your name  marisha beau  matt beau well a pleasure to meet you i am bentha tamalos and welcome to my meadery  marisha benth can i call you ben  matt call me bentha please  marisha bentha pleasure  matt pleasure to meet you as well darling well how many bottles would you like do /none/ you want  to have glasses separately or do you want to just buy bottles and serve yourselves  taliesin it smells really sweet whats the sweetest thing youve got right now  matt well its all pretty sweet its all brewed here with our islandcultivated honeybees  travis its sweet youll like it  sam lets just get a couple of bottles and share  taliesin sure i think that sounds like a great idea  laura you keep bees here  matt i do as well yes  laura can i see them  matt mm theyre not /none/ immediately local would you like a tour of our hives  laughter  taliesin this is going to go so well  matt i do have to ask unfortunately there is a tourist price for the tour  laura how much is that  matt five silver  laura okay  matt all right the bottles are 15 gold a piece you wanted two bottles thatll be 30 gold and  you wanted how many cups or do you just want your bottles  sam bunch of cups bunch of plates of gristle and meat and boar and fat  /none/ taliesin do you have anything thats more less meat  matt she looks up at you and goes do not worry honey i get you no problem all right ill  prepare this she does some calculations and goes all right for all of that together with  your glasses for each of you the meals prepared for each  sam some tripe maybe some knuckles  laura some pastries if you have them  matt unfortunately not much of a pastry opportunity out here on the swavain  laura mimicking benthas accent no cookies no doughnuts  matt her /none/ smile maintains but the eyes go hard but she goes no doughnuts however for  everything involved that would be 35 gold for all glasses of mead all food provided  marisha could you get it  travis dont look at me im shit broke  taliesin ill throw a little in on this  marisha i took 30 if you want to take the other five  matt and five silver for the tour for this blue young woman over here  taliesin that seems very fair  matt all right the food is presented it smells wonderful the /none/ din is quite loud now as the  various naval officers and naval soldiers of the clovis concord are surrounding the space and  chatting talking about bullshit some of it is in common some of it is not while you guys are  eating your food anything else you want to do the mead is quite good it is very sweet even  just finishing one glass youre like oh this is dangerous and probably going to give you a  headache if youre not careful what  marisha nothing  travis how many glasses did you have  /none/ marisha just one  travis ren faire ah  matt yeah severe ren faire flashbacks  laura i dont want any mead i just want the honey  travis three oclock  laura yeah  matt as you guys are in the process of eating your food a recentlyawoken and somewhat  harshlooking morning yasha wanders over  marisha you found us again this is the sixth time you just know where we are  laura well she was on the boat with us  travis she was on the boat beau  marisha i know but

well yeah i guess i did tell you im angry when i sleep i dont like being woken up i  forgot but it wouldve been nice to be woken up  sam im sorry  marisha this is precisely why we didnt wake you up  travis but we did make you this plate of food  marisha right yeah  ashley gobbling  /none/ marisha i pour her a very large glass of mead  travis ill go over and find bentha and be like can we get one more plate of food please  matt comes by and slips it over  travis ill hand that plate of food over to nott there you go no its not for you  sam oh  taliesin back out back out  sam food coming out of mouth noises  marisha laughter  matt as you guys are finishing your meal and yashas quietly staring into the plate and eating  with a distant intensity /none/ like shes prone to  travis were fitting to explore a little  marisha we were going to go on a winery tour  travis thats not  sam no thats not we were going to look for incense and supplies  taliesin insects supplies  travis maybe some weapons or some potions that might help should we find ourselves  sam we might also want to discuss what were doing next i mean we just had this crazy escape  from pirate island and now what are we doing where are we going  laura do you want us /none/ to go to this temple  travis i mean i would like to yeah i saw it in my visions and i havent had any other dreams  since i feel like this might be a good chance to put a dagger in it you know finish it up  sam do you know where  travis yeah i have a feeling its right in the middle of the archipelago thats just south of  here maybe a day and a half maybe two days most depending on  sam so more traveling on the water  travis just a /none/ little bit and then we can go back to land nott with the promise of land and no  more requests to go to sea if youll do this for me i would be most obliged  marisha fjord what was that naval officer  sam i will go  travis thank you nott  marisha sorry what was  sam hes being very nice today  laura yes i think he feels guilty  sam i know he feels guilty he asked you to accompany him off the boat he offered to make a  plate of food for /town/ you hes being nice to me  laura i know  sam gasp is he hitting on you  laura no  sam i think hes hitting on you  laura no hes not  sam are you sure  laura yeah  marisha what did that naval officer say to you about the war what was i hearing  travis he was saying theyve made their way south into the fucking town of nipple bottom  sam felderwin  travis felderwin yeah  sam its where some of us are from  travis yeah weve been right near that /none/ area  laura youre from felderwin  travis oh  laura youre from felderwin  sam around there yeah  travis its far more south than theyve been previously  marisha does that freak anybody else out  sam and marisha me  laura what about your you know  sam i dont know  marisha its not far from my hometown either  travis really that maybe changes things  marisha from kamordah  rustling noises  sam go to the map  travis point oh that is pretty far west  marisha yeah but he said that they /town/ were traveling under the mountains and kamordah is a  mountain town so  ashley whos traveling under the mountains  laura the xhorhasians  sam your people  marisha they got under the mountains and attacked felderwin  ashley huh  laura thats what all these soldiers are here for theyre going to join the fight or something  what did they say fjord  sam reinforcements  travis they were going down the southern coast yeah  ashley oh  travis most likely in an effort not to get flanked  ashley yeah okay  marisha i think /none/ we should still go to the temple though  travis well i dont feel quite as energetic knowing that where you both are from is under siege  marisha well im just being paranoid  sam im always paranoid  laura what if we went to the temple and then headed back no dillydallying we just go and  make sure that everythings okay  travis it may only add a day or two at most i would be most appreciative  taliesin no sense reading twothirds of a book lets finish this up see what it has to say /dung/  laura are you going to try to what are you going to do to ukotoa  laura and taliesin whispering ukotoa  sam did you selfecho  laura yeah i did  laughter  travis i dont know i just thought id feel it out when i got there all current and past events  taken into account  sam feel out whether you would raise ukotoa from the dark and join its dark ways  travis no no god no no i do have two of these spheres and i cant help but notice the  extra shamalamadingdong /none/ that avantika got by depositing one of them i could keep the third and  certainly keep that crazy fucking snake at bay i would like to see this through otherwise i feel  like ill always be wanting to get back here  laura plus we still havent found out about vandran  travis right but he could be fucking anywhere i want to do this because were here we can worry  about that later its a wide wide world  sam okay  marisha so we find the temple and then what i guess go back to /none/ nicodranas first yeah  travis we might have to go through port damali actually nicodranas is a little hot for us but  we could we could let your mom know that youre okay  laura i mean i can message her ive been messaging her  travis well maybe see how you feel when were on our way back we wouldnt want to go around the  southern tip thats where the troops are heading i feel like danger might be that way it might be  best to go the way we came  laura okay  sam /none/ all right  travis so maybe some supplies something to buff us up a bit  laura some bees  travis some bees yep  taliesin i think some bees would suit you  laura i just really want to see them  taliesin you can talk to them  laura i really want to talk to them  taliesin ive talked to many bees in my time  laura really  taliesin yeah  laura you can teach me the language  taliesin i mean you just hey bees howre you doing  sam sup bee  laura hi /none/ bees okay okay  taliesin and laura bzz  taliesin yeah  travis yasha is there anything you need while were in port anything youve been craving while  weve been at sea  ashley no no i just you guys were gone for a really long time  laura we didnt mean to be yasha  ashley you were gone for six days  travis we didnt have any idea that that was going to happen  marisha yeah we yeah  ashley i looked for you guys everywhere in that room i was just worried is all  /none/ marisha id be mad at us too  ashley i dont need anything from here i have everything that i need so if we need to go we  can go  taliesin thank you for looking everywhere in that room thats really nice  ashley well i just turned around and then you all were gone  taliesin yeah it was crazy in there  ashley yeah  sam did you have funerals for all of us must have taken a lot of time like one a day  taliesin i mean that actually would have covered everybody the /dung/ more you think about it  sam was mine nice did anyone come i guess not you were on the ocean did you say anything  ashley i did say some things that i probably should not share with you nott  sam like theyre bad words or something  ashley something like that  sam you cursed at my funeral  ashley i didnt have a funeral for you  sam i didnt even get a funeral everybody else did  ashley i didnt know if you were actually gone  sam everyone got a funeral but me  /none/ ashley no none of you did  sam oh my god you didnt give any of us funerals  ashley because i didnt know if you were alive or not i was still holding onto maybe that you were  and you just disappeared and you just didnt want to stay with me anymore you didnt want me part  of the group  laura yasha we want you to be part of the group  marisha oh yasha  ashley no i dont mean it like that im not saying you know woe poor me or something but  /none/ taliesin wait was alive or not a joke i always get confused when people use the word not  in a sentence was that supposed to be a  sam its confusing okay group rule if any of us are missing for four or more days we hold a  funeral right its four days  travis well lets make it an even seven like a week right because that spheres pretty fucking  sweet not that i have any interest in messing with it any further  sam hells no  laura if that dragon is dead theres a /none/ lot of stuff  taliesin though every time we did a little thing a little of that loot comes out  travis well yeah just a little there were fucking treasure troves in there not that im  interested in that im all for playing it safe measured practical thats my middle name fjord practical  sam whats your last name  laughter  travis fjord practical  laura fjord practical  marisha its the next sedan coming out  travis are there any potion shops around here  liam test drive a ford practical today  ashley what else /none/ have you found in there is there anything else did you already look at everything  laura caleb got some books  taliesin caleb is actually not over here  sam calebs back at the boat  marisha he decided to take some personal time to himself  laura to look at some books  taliesin everyone was a little thrown by what happened  laura we almost died yasha and then we really would have been dead and then we wouldnt have  come back  ashley i never would have known  laura no  ashley you fought /none/ something  laura there was a big blue dragon  ashley eh  travis no bigs no sweat  marisha oh a tuesday  travis are you going to show us the notches on your upper delt for all the ones that you  ashley well i can but i ran out of notches on my belt  cheering  travis fire  marisha she holds up a handful of shreds just fucked up  liam all those teenagers in hoodies are going like  travis it was pretty gnarly  ashley well im glad you guys are safe for /none/ whatever the fuck its worth  taliesin its worth a lot and probably well be a little more careful about poking things separately  travis i was testing the texture it wasnt even a push i just touched it  taliesin no its the buddy system no blame going around  travis before we go on the bee tour if theres any time do we see any magic shops weaponry  matt make an investigation check  taliesin were doing the bee tour  laura i want to see some bees  sam im looking for incense stores  travis /none/ 16  sam 16  matt okay magic shops just so you guys are aware are super rare theres one in zadash and  theres maybe one or two in rexxentrum  travis so theres definitely one here  matt theres definitely not one here  travis three competing for the same turf  matt theyre a relatively rare thing but herbalists are not too hard to find and healing  potions while they can heal the crafting of one doesnt require massive arcane knowledge its  through knowledge of medicines and proper brewing techniques however the army has bought /none/ up a lot  there are two regular healing potions you can find for sale for marked up because youre at sea  70 gold apiece  travis oh fuck  sam island prices  liam where else are you going to go  matt you can try and haggle if you want to  laura youve got two clerics you dont need it  travis i put a lot of healing potions into my group  marisha im getting poor you guys im getting dd poor  taliesin im going to try and find a blacksmith  sam really /none/ ive got lots of money  travis why dont you buy us a couple potions  sam yeah ill buy both healing potions  taliesin there may not be much time for such things but i was  matt depends on what youre looking for there is a blacksmith by the name of keisha budan who does  most of the metalwork for the ship repairs and other general goods that require metalwork around  the island  taliesin keisha  matt as you approach the space she has you can tell from the large smokestack pouring out of the /none/  top of the forge that she keeps but as you approach you can see a young woman in her late  20s or so massive arms her thick black hair pulled back into a tuft and she has a leather  apron on you can see now a lot of metal reinforcements used for holding beams together in  shipbuilding and shes laying them out one by one as she finishes hammering and then quenching and  then hammering and quenching as you walk up she rubs her brow can i help you  taliesin possibly not seems like /none/ you have your hands full right now i was hoping to at the very  least get a professional opinion about something  matt i can do my best i dont get many like your height in here anyway  taliesin thats what they tell me  matt at the very least im looking forward to sating my curiosity  taliesin well ive recently taken to travelling which very new experience for someone of my  disposition and i came across something interesting and i was curious if you had an  opinion on what this is and how one /none/ might fix it i pull out a broken sword  matt she takes it  taliesin i was really hoping to be doing something with this at some point and giving it  as a gift to a friend who could use a pickmeup  matt this is very good craftsmanship i could not do this unfortunately the break is very bad  do you have the other part of the weapon  taliesin sadly i dont it may not exist  matt if given maybe a week with the right materials i could maybe try to work on it /none/ but  honestly your best bet is probably to go into the coast we dont do much in the way of masterwork  weapon craftsmanship here on bisaft my apologies  taliesin oh thats all right theyre definitely trying hard to get us to leave a little sooner  than wed necessarily like to  matt it has been very busy this past day or two  taliesin has everything been all right by the way this seems like a lot of commotion  matt its a lot of commotion but theyll be gone soon we get waves of people /none/ coming through  taliesin well thank you so much for your time i dont know what i could possibly do in return  other than offer my gratitude  matt she sits up for a second and looks you over can i have a hug  laughter  taliesin yeah i go in  matt she goes and takes it and cuddles you  taliesin you want the spine lift  matt yeah  taliesin all right  matt thank you youre quite fuzzy and i was curious  taliesin oh thank you it was a pleasure i look forward /dung/ to coming your way again one of these days  matt any time were here on the island nowhere else to go  taliesin this is awfully nice  matt there are worse places to live ill tell you that have a good day whats your name  taliesin caduceus  matt caduceus keisha  taliesin keisha its a pleasure  matt the pleasure was all mine  taliesin i will wander back to the bees  matt you walk away to the sound of clanging in the background as she goes back to work  sam did i find /none/ any incense  matt because spice trade and various spices not spice trade here is quite prominent as  well as other such materials in that same avenue various herbs and compounds used in alchemical and  medicinal purposes yeah you can find incense here actually its marked up a little bit  because its bisaft and because its a trade post out in the middle of the ocean the people can  charge a little more and they know they can depending on how much incense you want to get  sam he did not give me an amount /none/ so whats a normal amount of incense that you would need for a  month of incense burning  matt for a person burning incense in their house  sam yeah like a hippie person  matt well say about 20 gold worth which would cost you 25 here  sam okay ill take 50 gold worth  matt okay so you take 50 gold worth but itll cost you 60 well say you mark off 60 gold but  you write down you have 50 gold worth of incense  sam great cool okay  matt all right the /none/ bee tour  laura hello bees  matt she takes you around behind the meadery theres a jungle path that leads through the very  lush green trees and its a very humid day the morning was a little gray in the sky and it looks  like it might rain in the next few hours or so she leads you through and is talking about how  many years her family has been running the meadery and its a wonderful place there isnt much of an  interest in mead out here in the island so she feels like /none/ she cornered the market a bit she has  friends that bring it to the other island towns and it makes a fair amount of money shes very  proud of it as shes doing the talk she leads you around there are a small sect of wooden hive  setups you can hear already as you approach the slight hum of them theres a young boy maybe 12  or so who is wearing a very thick smock with a hood who is in the process of scooping out some  of the honey  laura whoa do i /none/ need to wear a thingy  matt oh well stay here preferably do not get close enough to let them sting you and if ones on  you dont freak out and smack it please  laura okay but i really want to go up to them  matt the tour is not intended to bring you that close  laura hello bees hello bees please come over here and let me say hello  matt she looks very confused and goes okay  travis laughter  laura i start walking very slowly hello bees i want some honey  /none/ matt do you say that  laura yeah  matt she goes well if you want honey i can get you honey  laura yeah but i want the honeycomb straight from the thingy  matt ah  liam roll for nic cage  matt misan the little boy goes what bring some honeycomb over here for a customer okay  he cuts a little piece off with a dull knife and holds it on the edge of the knife and walks over  you see the bees covered up his arm and he puts it over and hands it /none/ to you  laura wow  matt its gooey its very sweet and very waxy  laura its really good its like gum but sweet can i have a jar of it  matt the boy heads back to his work and shes waving some of the bees away and goes sure  lets walk back ill be happy to sell you a jar or two how many would you like  laura with the actual honeycomb in it  matt of course  laura i want two jars  matt two jars thatll run you five gold pieces  /none/ laura okay  matt all right she claps her hands together happily and leads you back telling you more about  the waves of various traders and merchants that come through some individuals some names she  throws out that shes met and flirted with and one that asked her to marry him when she was younger  but she turned him down you have no idea who any of these people are but you cant help but be  halffascinated because theyre stories you have two jars of honey plus honeycomb for five gold  ashley and laura hello /none/ bees  taliesin i think i come wandering in about the point where theyre saying hello bees because  this is really all i want  ashley you can talk to them  laura yeah say something  taliesin what do you want me to say to them i dont know  laura tell them to come over here but dont sting us  taliesin hold on hold on let me do a thing  matt youre approaching right as theyre about to leave from the hives  taliesin im going to take a little bit of the tea out /none/ of my pocket im going to try and get a  bloom going on my staff to try and get a flower to start going on if i can get something to start  going a little bit it may not be temporary using the decompose i dont know if youll let me do that  matt a fungal bloom you can do with decompose druidcraft would be the creation of flowers unfortunately  laura maybe they like mushrooms  taliesin well i can ask hey guys i dont have any flowers but i have some mushrooms i dont  /none/ know if youd be interested but youre welcome to come over and take a look its probably going to  rain pretty soon its looking a little iffy  matt buzzing theyre doing their business theyre not paying any attention to you  taliesin theyre working really hard right now  laura yeah they look like it  ashley ive never seen bees before  taliesin youve never seen bees before  marisha do you not have bees in xhorhas  ashley we dont have flowers  marisha oh yeah right  taliesin wow  travis theres no greenery in /none/ xhorhas  marisha shes been collecting all those flowers  travis thats sad  taliesin we should fix that one of these days  ashley i didnt know any different  marisha do they have mushrooms  matt in the moorlands they have  ashley in the moorlands theres some  matt its a marshland where youre from  ashley its a marshland so theres occasionally  laura not colorful mushrooms just brown and gray and white maybe some black ones  ashley yeah  laura cool  travis anybody else have anything else they want to grab  sam /none/ i think were good  taliesin i got what i needed  travis you got that plate of food for caleb that you ate half of  sam i got the rest of it in my pockets its a little wet  taliesin is it possible to put some basic supplies is the ship already wellsupplied for a trip  matt you were given enough supplies for a week or so off of leaving darktow and you guys can create  your own food and water theres enough gunpowder for a dozen or so volleys of cannon fire  taliesin /none/ id say a little bit of spice so that the food that were creating doesnt taste too bland  travis by all means  taliesin would not be a bad idea because the magicallycreated food is spongy  matt you can drop a gold piece and be good for the next two weeks on flavoring the food for you  and the crew  sam should we set off or are we exploring this place more  travis is it still before sundown  matt at this point in the day its starting to get close to dusk  travis /none/ might get some money back  marisha 30 gold feels like a lot right now just saying  sam i wonder what calebs up to right now  matt which caleb during this time  marisha flashback riff  matt as youve spent most of the day on the ship to your own devices what are you doing  travis pooping  liam i am a morning pooper so that happened at the very beginning once i watched yasha leave the  boat i would have snapped frumpkin to and set him purring and worn him like a scarf go /none/ back to  my chambers and slowly and methodically take out the silver wire and cast alarm outside of my  doorway then take another ten minutes to cast leomunds tiny hut as a ritual in the room so  that the bubble goes up to the door then i will take out the jar of beads and the thing of ink  and the sphere from twiggy i would rest that on the table then as memory serves there was one  book with arcane equations open on the table which i put away was there a second book /none/ on the  table at that point as well there was two we got in our rush and caduceus just gave him one  matt correct you have four books total i think  liam i would set all four books down in a row and the sphere is there and these two items  stare at them  matt one thing you notice about the sphere its arrangement is entirely different remember where  all the places where you had shifted since you had gotten it from twiggy since youve returned its  like an entirely new sphere it /none/ has completely refigured its surface the bands have shifted all  the different places where youd place your fingers and thumbs to try to move the different  hemispheres are in completely different places it seems that whatever you triggered to get you to  the internal space and then returned from reset it in some way the puzzle has started all over  liam after a minute of feeling frumpkin purr away and staring at them i say in my own language in  zemnian i say well you piece of shit you should probably get to work i /none/ sit down and i  will identify the two items i will check out the books and if any of them are locked i will cast  knock on them to open them  matt thats easy enough to do the jar of beads  travis every flavor beans  marisha each one is a fireball  laura beads or beans or bees  matt the book  liam bees or bees or bees  travis beans and beans and beans  liam and bees and bees  travis fucking ridiculous  laura ugh i hate that he doesnt say /none/ what it is out loud  taliesin this is his favorite thing to do to hold a card and watch all of us wait for him to  show it to us  ashley was ist das  taliesin was is das das ist gut  matt all right so thats the spell book  liam is the ink normal  matt the ink is not normal it is faintly enchanted specifically for the intent of scribing  magical things for the purposes of scribing scrolls or scribing spells into spell books the  ink will make up to 500 /town/ gold worth of scribing you still need paper but essentially any  parchment can be made useful as if was the most premium of spell craft parchment with that ink  marisha fucking score  travis whispering write it on your body all over your body  taliesin your body is a road map of pain  travis whispering memento  liam that is probably it i would  matt you have the books too the other books  liam oh right yes correct yes lets inspect the other three  matt one of which after reading through it is /none/ essentially a number of studies on the effects of  alchemical compounds on corrupted plant life there is one that speaks of public debate records  within the forum of zeidel regarding the moral implications of arcane experimentation on  prisoners of ghor dranas and warnings of the war with the gods its a transcript of a debate  forum all you know about zeidel make a history check actually  laura zeidel high thats where grease takes place  liam 21  matt from your studies zeidel was one of a number of extremely erudite societies in the age /none/  of arcanum that had harnessed crystals to make their city hover aloft there were a handful of  these in the age of arcanum that could travel across exandria cities that were mobile as far  as anyone knows all of them had been wiped out during the calamity zeidel as far as youve  learned is one of them thats all you know  taliesin whispering were going to find the lost island of teddy ruxpin im ready for this  shit lets bring it  liam thats two  matt mmhmm the last one discusses the theories /none/ behind the ice fields and the underreaches of  eiselcross and the beasts that live and endure it  liam eiselcross  matt eiselcross eiselcross eiselcross you know is a rather large body of land to the  north of the main wildemount continent its considered part of wildemount overall but its  just a frozen arctic cap  liam not separated in any way just frozen over to the north or is it separate  matt its separate the frozen depths theres a large channel of water that separates the main  body of wildemount and eiselcross but aside /none/ from two very small ice fishing villages that are  expansions of the dwendalian empire it is mostly uninhabited nobody really goes there theres a  bunch of creatures that have spent a millennia or more living in that place that are extremely  dangerous and its just snow and ice so nobody goes there  liam okay well theres nothing else that i would do i would say that all the time they were  gone he sits rolling the ball on the table and speed reading these books thats it  matt cool enough all right  travis /none/ whispering the frozen depths  matt eiselcross is far north of that  travis whispering oh farther north  liam whispering even frozener depths  travis whispering off the map or on it  matt off the map  travis fuck  taliesin were going off the map man probably need a special boat for that  travis i thought it was time for some mercer mystery shit  matt you guys manage to make your way back you manage to recover your 30 gold from the  dockmaster podderan you get back to your ship and you caleb hear /none/ the rest of your party return as  the rest of the crew begins to prepare for setting sail off the dock  marisha i go over to caduceus and i pull him aside really quick  taliesin oh  marisha hey cad i have a thought  taliesin cool  marisha as you may have heard i have now become first mate  taliesin i didnt know that people dont tell me those sorts of things  marisha no really no one told you  taliesin oh they might i just might forget  marisha sure  taliesin you /none/ may have already told me i dont know  marisha i probably have with that responsibility i started thinking about the crew  and maybe we havent been treating them the best that we could be you know i think theyre okay  i dont think that were abusing them but maybe neglecting them anyway i got this extra bottle  of mead for them and i thought maybe with some of the stuff we got maybe we could do a nice  dinner for them or something to just show our appreciation  taliesin i think thats a very /none/ good idea  marisha i really dont want to get stabbed in the middle of the night is what im thinking so its  a little bit still selfish but really dont want to die by one of these fuckers  travis show our appreciation to these fuckers  taliesin you made caduceus laugh oh no its not even me laughing well i can think of worse plans  than a nice bottle of wine with a card that says please dont stab me in the middle of the night  marisha oh a card i didnt think you think /none/ theyd appreciate that i could write that down yeah  taliesin you know i actually think that maybe not giving them the idea in the first place might  be a better well yeah i think the big deal will be when we finally do find a little money  making sure it spreads around a bit  marisha good call  taliesin but bringing back some of the mead and dispersing it amongst the crew is definitely a  sign that were probably going to do that when we do that is very astute of you  marisha thanks /none/ i feel like a first mate should be astute  taliesin i have a confession i dont know what astute means i heard one of the crew use it so  im hoping it means a good thing  marisha it does you used it pretty correctly i think  taliesin i was mirroring something somebody else said  marisha deductive reasoning youve got it nailed it man yeah good work okay im going  to go now  taliesin okay yeah  marisha i start prepping the boat  matt all right with that as everyone gets prepared orly /none/ comes out from underneath the deck  and turns to you and goes captain where about are we taking off towards  travis navigator set course for the gravid archipelago archipelago arkapelagos  matt its archipelago  travis archipelago  matt well go ahead and make sure were heading that way he turns around to the rest of the  crew begins giving a couple orders heading over and getting his map out pull up the anchor and  slowly you guys begin to make your way out onto the lucidian ocean just as the sun begins to set  /none/ now the sky itself has been pretty gray and cloudy and youve been smelling the coming of  weather no more than 20 minutes after leaving the rain begins  travis this is fucking unexpected the skies were pretty clear  laura caduceus knew that it was going to rain  marisha he did  travis huh that is one smart cow  marisha i was waiting for your response  sam hows yasha is she staring off into space or just doing stuff  laughter  matt for most of this travel youve kept an aspect of your consciousness /none/ looking out for  errant weather and thereve been a few moments where some rains have come through that brief  interaction with the divers grave in which a storm was conjured but it didnt have the same  feel that youd been hoping whatever this draw was that drew you southward and to run into these  friends again at the coast as you begin to push further and further towards the direction of the  storm theres an excitement in your belly that you cant describe  ashley okay cool  taliesin youre looking for a sign  /none/ ashley i guess im always looking for a sign now  taliesin me too  ashley yeah how did you know it was going to rain i mean other than the obvious gray skies  taliesin well the skies were turning the wind was coming in and i honestly have to mention my  knee hurts a little bit on the left side usually about an hour beforehand it was a thing my sister  did it was 25 seasons ago give or take shes a piece of work shes great a piece of work  ashley it just hurts /dung/ when it gets cold type of a thing  taliesin yeah usually half a day before it rains  ashley thats a pretty great indication  taliesin yeah  matt as the rain begins to hit the deck itself the endless patter of heavy droplets smattering  against the dark wood the winds begin to pick up a little bit and some of the crew begins to look  off you see marius glance off and go captain should we put up the storm sails the winds  picking up a bit  travis of course storm sails it is /none/ on the double  matt it takes them a little bit  travis why arent they up already inaudible  matt they start diminishing the presence of the regular sails and getting smaller more durable  sails pulled up in there  marisha i pay attention  matt youre probably helping them with it its an all hands on deck thing to get this going  quickly with that they begin to pull the sails into place the wind immediately picks up again  once the sails are back in and the wind is starting to pick up a bit /none/ heavily you see orly  glancing over the edge his large shell slick with rain smattering against the backside of it as he  turns around towards you and looks at you through the darkness the little bit of light there is  from oil lanterns being held across the deck goes captain i think were heading into a  proper storm  marisha damn could you be more ominous orly were you trying i think he was trying  matt more ominous captain were heading into a proper storm  marisha that was good i think that was pretty

marisha yeah i was almost like captain  taliesin thats an amazing list of things that you are not  /none/ matt your nerves are slightly set on edge as you can see the distant flashes of lightning

mind ill give you advantage on this  marisha o captain my captain  sam hey before we go into the storm you want to look in the old fatechanging thing  travis i had advantage on it already 14  /none/ matt well that adds onto advantage  travis oh does it  matt yeah it acts as a luck point it actually technically is a third die but youve already rolled  travis okay 14  matt okay good keeping it steady in going in the ships handling it fine the winds are heavy  but the repairs you made thankfully have brought the balleater up to a very functional ship the  crew is experienced and now that they seem to be a little more comfortable under your leadership  and with the help of the rest of the /none/ party  you guys have taken some time at sea to learn a number  of skills that are helpful  your first bit of evening travel into the storm seems to be going  well it goes on for a few hours the storm doesnt seem to be getting worse necessarily but  the waves are rocking quite a bit eventually into the early hours of the morning sleep is  going to have to come to some of you at the very least  taliesin i definitely could use some sleep  matt so youre going to sleep /none/ whos

things that he believed so i wasnt allowed to have a lot of friends really any friends  /none/ laura you could have used the traveler in your life too then  marisha maybe maybe i would have turned out a little bit more like you i admire that in you in  my loneliness i got angry and turned to bad things but in your loneliness you turned to  creativity i think thats beautiful i really do  laura ill

the helm with orly so theyre both towards the back  ashley okay i want to stay anywhere on the boat where the storm is most visible so i guess  matt probably closer to the bow or the foremast  ashley thats where ill be  matt okay in keeping this going do you head back up to help fjord or are you heading to rest  as well  marisha i head to rest he gave me permission to  matt its /none/ hypnotic the sound of rain and the movement of the waves and the flashes of light  and the rolling of thunder you grab the edge of the rail of the bow looking out straight into the  storm that youre passing into its a blur of light and movement and darkness the horizon  beyond your vision is obscured it feels like youre riding this into a tumultuous sky you  begin to fall into a trance your eyes closing for

there  sam he was doing things with flourish yeah  matt gotcha its important  taliesin thats the nicest way anyone has ever put that thank you  matt as the sound of the storm and the movement of the ship begins to lull you into this /none/ trance  your lids grow heavier and heavier and as your fingers tighten and clasp the edge of the bow  your vision goes darkand youre kneeling you open your eyes and youre cleaning a fox you  hunted and pulled from the nearby brush you look across the surrounding iothia moorland the sheen  of the shallow pools dotting the flat swamp brush landscape the grays and browns of the valley  beneath the clouded skies that raised you this is the home you knew the muted colors are  comforting you hear a voice shouted at a distance /none/ yasha you turn and see the rest of  your hunting party of the dolorav tribe walking towards you dirty and smiling is zualla her  leather marked with mud her brown eyes barely visible under her tangled hair thats a hearty  fox for one care to share it the warmth in your chest fills you theres a flash of lightning  behind you at that instant you see zualla fleshless and bone then darkness once more  another subtle flash but blue and muted another a roiling ball of storm clouds grows before you in  this veil /none/ of shadow swelling as the interior sparks and flashes with light intensely and they  occur more and more rapidly as this sphere of roiling storm grows and swells you sense  something contacting you and while it isnt speaking with words you interpret it through  language through your mind loss loss is excruciating loss is paralyzing loss is  inevitable loss can bring sorrow bring hate bring cruelty and darkness another bright flash  you see a muddied field of burning huts corpses lie at your feet your blade bloodied a figure  turns to you eyes aglow /none/ with yellow their deep red skin and hooked horns peeking from beneath  their folded wings their smile curls open your anger is beautiful to behold orphan maker  another flash only the rolling storm remains thunder crash the thoughts return this voice  coalesces into more of an actual throaty deep timbre loss can instead teach you what is  important it offers perspective it offers focus might the courage to protect what has not yet  been lost to be alone to push others away can prevent loss but it also prevents growth  strength purpose how much /none/ how many will you lose until you find your strength the thunder  gets louder and louder cutting through the veil you find your consciousness tug at your mind and  slowly you begin to shake out of this fugue state the sound of muffled rain once again growing loud  around you the cold sensation of it dripping through your armor another crack of thunder as  the dream begins to fade the voice says show me show me what is important what is worth  protecting this storm was birthed only for you your eyes flicker wide and /none/ youre back on the  edge of the ship the wave hits the bow of the ship once more you hold tight your hair slicked  down across your face as you look up and with that a single bolt strikes down slamming into the  front of the ship where you expect to see splintered wood and fire instead there is just a  darkened spot the impact muted what you see there instead a creature a manlike shape made  of crackling blue energy it stands your height vaguely humanform shifting with unstable power  suddenly two vibrant /none/ wings of lightning open from its back like an angel it walks towards you  ashley are you him  matt its going to claw across the front of your body  ashley okay okay okay lets go  matt all right that is going to be a 16 to hit whats your armor class  ashley 14  matt all right  sam 14 dont you have a shield or something jesus  liam she can rage she doesnt need a shield  travis rage doesnt raise it  matt as it claws across the front of your body /none/ its hand seems to almost pass through the  resistance of the armor for but a minute before you feel this shock to your system as it arcs  through you feel the lightning pulse through your body you suffer eight points of bludgeoning  damage plus five points of lightning damage  laura would we have seen the lightning hit the ship  matt you were below deck and there  laura no im upstairs  matt oh youre upstairs you guys watched a bolt of light strike down towards the ship all you see  is this faint /none/ dull glow like a mote of energy thats rolling around make a history check  travis me  matt yes  travis ooh 16  matt youve heard tales of something called ball lightning bits of storm matter that just scatters  across its usually innocuous and people either watch it fizzle out or get it thrown overboard it  usually happens in the cusp of a storm and you watch it dance along the vicinity of yasha but  thats not what you see i need you to roll initiative  sam oh boy  laura all alone  /none/ ashley i get advantage now oh fuck ten  matt all right its going first  ashley my low fucking initiative  matt as you reel from it reaching back for your blade the creature seems to be intent on you its  form seeming to shift and bend with the wind and the rain its going to reach out towards you for  two more strikes that is going to be a 13 to hit  ashley 14 armor class  matt thats going to be a 16 to hit  ashley that hits  matt that is going /none/ to be five points of bludgeoning and two points of lightning  ashley which brings me to seven total okay  matt its your turn  ashley okay now that i know this is not who i thought it was i am going to rage i would like  to rage and in that rage im going to unfurl my wings  travis oh shit thats only the second time i think  matt your skeletal wings flare out from under your back your hair blown up from the wind and  the impact of the wings flying out from /none/ underneath the shawl it needs to make a wisdom saving throw  i believe  ashley charisma saving throw  matt that is a six it has no bonus it is afraid of you for how long  ashley sorry this is one minute  sam okay thats good  matt all righty does it get to save at the end of its turn or is it just afraid of you  ashley hold on mumbling be frightened of me until the end of the next turn  matt okay got you oh and then it lasts for a minute /none/ if you do the extra damage once during  each of your turns you deal extra necrotic damage to one target when you do damage to it it equals  your level so you do an extra seven points of necrotic damage once per turn to it keep that in mind  ashley okay  matt thats the end of the round you guys look over and watch yasha at the end this mote of  lightning dancing around her rolling across but slightly hovering above the surface of the boats  deck suddenly she unleashes her fallen form the /none/ wings rising up other members of the crew that  are holding down the ropes see this and take a step back not entirely familiar with this appearance  travis steady  ashley only within ten feet  matt correct theyre not frightened of you theyre just really spooked by the reveal its  going to swirl around you suddenly it seems to move with pulses of energy with an unnatural  speed whips to the opposite side and it is going to attempt to try and slash into the lower back  thats going to be a nine and /none/ a 21 to hit  ashley okay that one hits  matt okay thats going to be eight points of bludgeoning damage reduced to four because youre  raging plus four points of lightning damage  ashley okay oh god ive lost count  matt oh im sorry it has disadvantage on the attacks i need to roll that other attack again  okay still hits because its frightened of you  ashley 71 minus seven  taliesin i think youre because the other one missed so i think youre at  matt its going to attempt all right its /none/ going to attempt to move away from you  ashley can i try and grab it  matt you can attempt to ill let you grapple as a reaction sure  ashley ill grapple as a reaction oh fuck  matt its an athletics check for you because youre raging its at advantage  travis thats right  ashley okay  laura with advantage  ashley 22  matt yeah its staying you reach out and your hand passes partly through it and it goes numb  the field of sparkling energy lightly electrifying the skin around your hand but /none/ you manage to get  hold of something its not solid matter but something as it tries to move away you keep it  there barred in place that ends its turn its your go  ashley all right im going to take out my sword and im going to attack it  matt go for it youve got two attacks  ashley okay thats okay oh wow okay  matt are you doing this reckless or not  ashley oh shit sorry no ill take the first roll sorry im forgetting everything no im  not doing reckless

i say youre not going anywhere ill attack  laura what is she doing what is yasha doing  matt youre watching her reaching out and grabbing this small sphere of sparkling energy  she grasps it grabs her blade and strikes through with both hands arcing downward because  you do have two hands youd /none/ lose the grapple because it is a twohanded weapon  ashley okay thats fine  matt but you also have sentinel so if it tries to get away you can hit it  taliesin oh my god  travis plus your rage damage  ashley 23  sam that was plus the seven  ashley plus the seven no 30  matt plus the seven once per round 30 points of damage  sam yeah first attack second attack  ashley jeez louise  sam dont you get two attacks  matt you have two attacks every turn i know /none/ its been a while  ashley yeah im

roll again im sorry im so nervous im sorry  that does not hit  matt what was that  ashley it was a two plus  matt no im afraid that does not this first swing strikes through you watch the spark /none/ flash  with energy for a second the second swing goes wide it moves around zigzagging as it curls  around her you want to do anything or just watching  laura no i want to run forward  matt okay so you rush over in the direction of where she is and this entity  laura yasha do you need help  ashley no  laura okay  ashley but if you want to  laura no  matt back to its turn right there in front of you its going to attempt to use anger of the  /none/ tempest it pulls back from you its no longer frightened of you it goes from its defensive  position to leaning in towards you it looks up at the sky and as a moment theres this slight smell  of burnt hair that catches your nose before a bolt of lightning arcs from the sky and slams into you  i need you to make a dexterity saving throw you do have advantage on this  ashley yes i have advantage on okay thats 15  matt 15 does not make it  laura and ashley oh no  travis /none/ oh thats a lot  ashley oh god thats a lot  matt you take 23 points of lightning damage and as the bolt hits you your whole upper torso goes  numb your fingers arent responding and you drop your sword to the ground the creature bends down  and picks it up and holds it up looking right at you doesnt move your turn  sam it has to move isnt it frightened  matt not anymore and frightened doesnt force you to move you just cant get closer  sam oh shit  matt its your turn /none/  laura that looked like it hurt do you want to be healed  ashley maybe a little lower than i thought i would be can i try to grapple again and try to  get my sword back  matt you can use an attack to try and disarm it if youd like  ashley okay id like to try and disarm  matt okay make another athletics check you have advantage on it because youre raging  ashley 21  matt no it had a plus three and rolled a 13 so 16  laura oh it didnt /none/ succeed  ashley i was like how  matt as it pulls back attempting to use magicians judge against you you reach forward  and grab it and for a moment youre both struggling back and forth you manage to rip it  from its hand its fingers actually evaporating as you rip it from its form and then reform where  they were previously the energys still arcing around it and it moves around to almost try and  move to your flank but you shift around to face it you have your other attack if youd like  /none/ ashley yes okay oh no sighs forgot to reckless can you call out reckless im  forgetting everything  travis beforehand yeah  ashley you have to call it out beforehand sorry  matt you call it at the beginning of your turn  ashley 11  matt 11 does not hit goes wide unfortunately your bodys still numb from the impact of the  lightning bolt you reel from it angrily that finishes your turn  ashley yeah  laura can i heal her  matt do you

its size with her presence arriving  travis jester get the hell out of there  laura i didnt know i was trying to help did i see that happen or did it just look like a ball to me  matt you watch this thing all of a sudden get brighter and more intense you dont know what  that means top of the round its turn its going to take two more strikes at you let me see if it  gets its /none/ lightning back  sam lightning back  matt nope all right its going to make two more strikes at you yasha  ashley okay  matt ooh thats going to be a 20 and a 21  ashley yeah both hit  matt first one comes at you with

lightning back its going to first attempt to move away from you its going to  hover away and actually begin to rise up in the air you do get an attack of opportunity towards it  laura sentinel  matt it is not reckless though because /none/ its only on your turn  ashley 13  matt 13 misses the swing goes wide and it hovers 15 feet up near the mast where the lower sail is  it hovers up in this space and looks up in the air once more as its electrified wings unfurl and its  arm goes up as it stares down at you you see these large blue sparks where its eyes would be  as it pulls its arm down the bolt strikes down and slams into you once more make another  dexterity saving throw with advantage  ashley /none/ okay 20 total  matt that succeeds okay and thats a good thing you take 13 points of lightning damage and  you do not drop your weapon you shrug off the numbness from the impact but it is 15 feet above you  ashley fuck  matt which is out of your melee range its up near the sail on the mast its your turn  ashley i call out to the stormlord what do you want me to do  matt do you wait for a response  ashley yes  matt no response just the sound of /none/ thunder and lightning rolling  ashley okay i move closer to it  matt how do you move closer to it  ashley is it directly above me  matt its above and back up by the mast and the sail about 15 feet above you  ashley sighs this is so stressful when its about you  laura can you fly  matt not with the wings no  ashley no i wish yeah im going to try to climb up  matt okay i mean theyre designed for climbing so you go ahead and as its up in /none/ the air you  rush over to the mast climbing your way up you get to the edge and there is where the sail is in  the side youre holding onto it off the point you manage to get within melee range of it you  used your action to call out to the stormlord and waiting for the response but youre now adjacent  to it  ashley okay so ill just keep my sword at the ready  matt okay jester you move further away get closer reenter what are you doing  laura yasha what do /none/ you want me to do  ashley i dont know just stay safe  laura ah i back up ten more feet  matt okay ten more feet next round you watch its physical size reduce it shrinks back down to  its original form matching yours onetoone as it floats there its electrical wings not flapping  but arced held aloft at each of its sides on its turn it does not get its lightning back its  going to attempt to strike at you twice as it rushes you towards the mast trying to knock you  off /none/ the first ones going to be a shove attack to try and knock you off the mast thats a natural  one no it goes to shove towards you and you just pull in and it zips past at that point it comes  back around to try and claw at you with its other hand thats going to be a 20 to hit  ashley that hits  matt that is five points of bludgeoning damage it would be ten but its reduced to five then  four points of lightning damage its going to attempt to move up /none/ further away from you leaning  further up and away from the masthead make another attack of opportunity if youd like  background music thunder  ashley okay wait still just one well the first one was good 21 again  matt 21 hits roll damage and because of your sentinel feat you prevent it from moving  travis yes you drop their speed to zero  marisha sentinel bitches  ashley ten  matt ten points of damage as you arc past with your blade and strike at it attempting to move  away its midsection separates and the /none/ lower legs fizzle out and no longer exist suddenly its  lower part of its torso flickers and then grows two new legs made of pure electrical energy as  the winds blowing by your hair being thrown past your shoulders the rain beating down on your face  as youre holding onto the side of the mast leaning your arm in and then striking with your  twohanded sword best you can it cant seem to find its way beyond your reach now its your turn  ashley okay im going to try to take my blade and put /none/ it through its torso  matt okay im going to say because of the rain didnt do it last round but as youre now  up in this area holding on while also striking it you have disadvantage on the attacks because it is  a twohanded weapon  travis but if you make it reckless its a straight roll  ashley oh yeah reckless  matt all right  ashley okay okay okay thats18  matt 18 hits go ahead and roll damage  laura oh thats good  ashley counting 19 oh im sorry 25  matt 25 /none/ points of damage to it as it arcs past one of the wings gets shaved off and falls and  sputters and turns to particle sparks before vanishing into the storm the wing begins to  flicker to regrow itself you have your second attack  ashley oh thats right okay still reckless  matt well reckless is preventing the disadvantage  ashley oh shit okay that doesnt hit  matt whatd you roll  ashley a three plus nine  matt no this one unfortunately goes wide with the second strike as your arms looped through the  mast /none/ trying to hold on this time the other wing manages to flicker in and it just ducks out of the  way jester staying out or coming in  laura staying out of it  matt all right back to the top of the round the creature now you see the storm growing heavier  and heavier around the rain now is coming in heavy sheets across the deck the crews yelling  off you hear the shouting of the crewmen trying to keep the sails from tearing you hear fjord  shouting orders to them from behind but the /none/ words arent reaching you its just noise lost in the  wind and the sound of the storm around you its going to attempt well see  laura you can do it yasha  matt it does get its lightning strike back  ashley whispering fuck  matt as youre up there holding the mast knowing its coming as the creature puts its hands up  the bolt strikes down once more slamming to you and the mast i need you to make another dexterity  saving throw  marisha no we just got that repaired  taliesin and travis /none/ advantage  ashley 11  dice rolling  travis come on  matt wasnt a great roll so youre lucky on that thats 13 points of lightning damage  laura oh my

ashley oh my god okay okay okay  marisha merry christmas  travis how far away is it from you on that mast  ashley yeah /none/ how far yeah  matt its five feet from you it hasnt pulled away youve prevented it from leaving but it did  manage to knock the weapon out of your hands  ashley is there anything in the torso  matt the energy that it seems to create has this field of electricity you do see the bright points  where its eyes are that are these two beacons of intense electrical energy and the faint heartlike  glow that emanates from the center of its torso the full thing is made of energy from different  intensity levels /none/ that almost give variations to colors of blue and white  ashley okay i want to try to grab it again grab it from the inside and try to pull it off of the mast  matt make an athletics check you do not have disadvantage on this you have advantage because  of your  ashley i have advantage  matt because youre raging still  ashley okay thats right both the same 12  matt okay 12 thats a 16 you try and reach out for it and it just manages to duck out of the way  /none/ you have a second attack are you doing another grapple or are you  ashley im going to try to do another grapple  matt go for it with advantage because youre raging  ashley 22  matt yeah it does not succeed on that as it ducks past the one you reach out getting to the  limits of your arm reach from the edge of the mast as you do your hand plunges into its chest  ashley can i pull it off of the mast  matt next turn if you can keep it up as youre /none/ holding it there and its grappled its strength  is zero your hand is plunged about two or three inches into the energy field that is its torso  you can feel your fingers vibrating with energy and it hurts it hurts but you grit your teeth  glaring past you can hear the waves crashing around you the ship itself is rocking with heavy  momentum but youre focused on the moment on its turn its going to attempt to attack you that is  a natural one you are lucky but the second one is a 13 again /none/ wait wait yeah 13 plus six shit  laura oh my god  travis one below your ac  matt man okay oh lets see it does not get its lightning back that would have been good to  roll beforehand  ashley okay my turn i want to keep holding and i want to squeeze even harder whatever it is that  im holding onto and try to yank down and

wide  ashley okay im going to keep trying to pull whatever that is  matt make another strength check with advantage  ashley 17  matt crackling pop as you pull it from the chest the body flickers out and youre falling  the /none/ momentum pulling you off of the mast you plummet 15 feet slamming into the deck  laura as i see her falling i run forward to try to cast cure wounds right as she  matt you take five points of bludgeoning damage from the impact reduced to two because of the  rage you crack down onto the hard wood of the deck  ashley i am at one hit point  matt no fucking way  ashley yes fucking way  matt thats two episodes in a row  ashley im just laying there and im holding  /none/ laura i look down at her are you okay  ashley i dont know  laura what did you do  ashley i dont know am i still holding it  matt your fingers are buzzing you look and theres nothing there  ashley did you see that thing  laura i saw a ball of light i saw you fall off the mast  ashley you didnt see any creature or anything  laura it was a big ball of lightning stuff your sword fell down here  ashley i was fighting something it was a creature  laura /none/ what did it look like cure wounds  ashley it was winged and it had red eyes it looked like it was a ball of lightning  laura what do you think it meant  ashley i dont know i was standing in front of the ship and i had a vision of home then i woke  up and then the lightning struck when it came down it was the creature  laura it only wanted to fight you  ashley i guess if you didnt even see it i grabbed something out of it i guess it was /none/ its  heart now its gone  laura yasha this is really important  ashley okay well maybe i need to think on this a little bit more  laura we should talk to caduceus  ashley yeah  laura mmhmm he has really good insight plus he makes good tea it will make you feel better  travis jester whats going on down there  laura yasha fought a ball of lightning but everythings okay shes good were going to get  some tea though  ashley im okay  laura the mast looks like it maybe got burned /none/ a little again  travis maybe see to the repairs first before you get your fucking tea  laura why dont you stop being a dick i crawl up and cast mending on the sail by the way  youre healed 14 points  matt because the lightning mostly impacted yasha the damage was minimal to the mast thankfully if  she had succeeded on her save oh wait no you succeeded the last save  sam she did succeed  matt the mast is a little damaged but with immediate mending ill say you can undo it a  /none/ little bit  laura plus im one of the carpenters ive got extra skills  ashley im going to go talk to caduceus  matt okay as you continue to help keep this ship going through the middle of this storm you make  your way below deck and find caduceus in his chamber  taliesin snoring  ashley hey caduceus  taliesin grunting awake  ashley hey  taliesin sniffing did you get hit by lightning  ashley yes  taliesin wow hold on oh man  ashley sorry burning hair is not a good smell  taliesin no /none/ thats nice its fresh hold on lets do something about that im going to do  another quick cure wounds at a ridiculous level lets do it at third lets give you another 3d8  plus five to get that going what happened  ashley well i was oh that wouldve been nice  taliesin 21  ashley okay i was at the bow of the boat and i was trying to connect with the stormlord i dont  know i ended up getting a vision  taliesin you got a sign  ashley i think i did  taliesin /none/ i mean sniffs yeah thats a sign you got hit youre pretty fried  ashley im pretty fried i fought something though it was lightning that came down and then  turned into a creature  taliesin i dont know how to make this sound normal did it know you did it feel like it was  there for you  ashley yes  taliesin well somebodys paying attention congratulations you probably need some food  wheres your sword  ashley its here  taliesin thats amazing well now that you seem to have the stormlords attention now what  /none/ ashley i think i need to keep trying to find him i guess hes found me  taliesin now what  ashley thats what i was going to ask you im going to go back upstairs  taliesin ill go to the kitchen and put the kettle on i think sometimes youre running toward  something so fast that you dont remember why you were running in the first place ive had some  moments like that with these people a couple times where i felt distant from whats important  recently ive been thinking about this river in the /none/ northern forest its not a big river you  watch the river and every year its a little different we used to make little leaf boats and  put them down and watch them and every year it was a different path but its all going to end up  in the ocean eventually i think that youre going to be ending up in your destination real soon i  think were barreling toward it congratulations im going to go make tea sighs and i go make tea  ashley i go back upstairs  matt since it was your /none/ vision if you wish to look over the words that were told to you keep  that for you  sam whispering clues  laura clues and clues  taliesin zoinks  laura clues and clues and beans and beans  sam look at the first letter of every word and then take those and rearrange them  taliesin lets get some lemon juice and a candle  ashley i go back upstairs  matt to the dock to the deck  ashley mmhmm  matt okay  ashley i just want to sit outside still  matt okay you /none/ make your way back up  laura is it peaceful  matt its still raining but the storms ferocity seems to have slowly diminished its still a storm  travis less steady  matt but you seem to have come through the bulk of its intensity and danger and from your  experience knowing youre probably starting to come out the other end itll be a few more hours  of fording this but youre getting pretty exhausted  travis i may send orly or someone else below decks to go wake up beau  matt okay orly stays but /none/ sends marius to go ahead and wake beau comes back up and shes in  his wake  marisha sup  travis yeah were through the worst of it listen if for some reason yasha comes back up  and starts swinging at a bunch of balls of light on the front of the ship just dont get involved  im going to sleep  marisha what  travis mumbling nothing just going gibberish  marisha okay  laura yawns im so tired thank you caduceus  taliesin the ships name makes sense now  laura the balleater oh yeah /none/  taliesin the eater of balls  laura and also our captain also eats balls  taliesin everybody now i feel better about the whole its a good name it works out  liam singing to the tune of moon river ball eater  laura you feeling any better yasha  ashley i guess so im just trying to make sense of all this still i feel like i had some  visions of home that made me very happy and sad at the same time but it must all mean something  laura what made you leave in the /none/ first place  background music  ashley um  laura it had to be scary right if thats all youd ever known  ashley yeah i had to leave  laura why  ashley i did something that i did something that wasnt the right thing to do according to my tribe  laura you can say what it is whispering i wont tell anyone  ashley in my tribe we have a matriarch of the tribe the champion and her name is the skyspear  laura whoa thats a cool name  ashley and when you become a part /none/ of the tribe you take a blood oath and you get a name and i  was given the name orphan maker when you become a part of the tribe as time goes on you are given  a mate but i fell in love with someone else that was not chosen for me and we got married privately  laura gasps you got married yasha  ashley i did but they found out and the punishment for that is death and they killed her  and i ran away so i i am a coward i guess  laura /dung/ yasha youre not a coward youre one of the bravest people ive ever met  ashley thank you jester in our tribe when you get married its for life even if shes gone  shell always be mine  laura what was her name  ashley her name was zuala  laura thats really beautiful  ashley yeah i left and im sure they were coming after me and i got into the wastes of xhorhas and  something happened theres time that i cannot account for i was out there for months by myself  and it seems like /none/ i woke up months later and i looked different and i felt different i woke up  at an altar of the stormlord and he saved me for what yet i dont know but hopefully i can be a  better champion for him and fulfill whatever purpose he has for me  laura did he heal your heart or are you still sad  ashley i dont know if my heart could ever be healed but im okay with that i feel like if it  were put back together then that means zuala would be gone i know /none/ one day i want to go back  there i dont know where she was buried but i have so many flowers to bring to her i dont know  what all this means but i sometimes i dont know i dont know  background music  laura i didnt know  ashley i feel like sometimes i get nervous to get close to people because i feel like i lose them  and then molly  laura and then molly  ashley i feel like im either very unlucky or cursed and i dont believe in luck  laura /none/ curses and luck they go together if you dont believe in luck you cant believe in being  cursed either  ashley thats true  laura and mollys still with us the same way that your beautiful wife is  ashley yeah i think so i think so this is very good tea  taliesin been saving it  ashley whats in here  laura gasps you didnt put some of that stuff in did you  taliesin oh that no although i did think about it no this is from home this is the  cadence family if i /none/ recall its very minty  travis and liam laughing very minty  marisha laughing the cadence family  ashley like its people  taliesin i mean technically yeah  ashley im fine with it  laura minty people  background music  ashley well maybe this is best kept to us  laura i wont tell anyone  ashley i mean im fine with saying it but its a long story and  laura thank you for trusting us with that yasha  ashley of course  laura sometimes it helps to say things out loud  ashley i think /none/ so i feel like im trying to learn that from you jester  laura really  ashley yeah you say whats on your mind  taliesin its true  ashley its good  laura yeah  ashley im going to try to start doing that  taliesin to surviving  ashley to surviving  laura to minty families  ashley to minty families  taliesin the mintiest  matt as the storm subsides slowly over the next few hours and one by one you all eventually find  yourself feeling comfortable to return to your quarters for an evenings rest /none/ the days travel  comes to a complete circle the morning comes with clear skies as the distant gray fades in the  north another half days travel leads you to see a few bodies of land on the horizon  travis hey nice job  marisha sharply inhales yeah  travis really  marisha i was awake the whole night  travis which direction are we pointed  marisha the one were heading in fjord which is the only way we could be heading  travis which is  marisha towards our destiny  laughter  travis orly  /none/ marisha orly which way are we heading  matt i reckon towards them islands he points over to the bodies of land on the horizon  marisha towards the islands  travis nice job  marisha thank you  matt now coming across the gravid archipelago and youd know this a little bit though youve  not actually traveled to these before you can see this trio of islands are rather rocky and are  only marked with small pockets of trees and jungle much of the land on these islands is  steep volcanic peaks with sheer cliff faces /none/ pockmarked with caves similar makeup as a lot of  darktow actually they were both probably created from similar volcanic activity from under the  ocean but not very welcominglooking islands with little safe land to navigate or exploit for  resources there is very few reason for ships to stop here as you guys begin to make your way you  can see the two nearest to you and the third there what would you like to do  travis plot a course that would put us right in the middle of all three  matt okay he goes /none/ ahead and continues the path of the balleater  taliesin well work on it  matt nothing quite like high fantasy  ashley balleater  travis it was the squalleater  marisha so we just painted it  ashley the boat is called the balleater  sam and laura yes  ashley the balleater  taliesin eater of balls  marisha to be fair hes eaten some balls  taliesin and now you have as well  ashley ive eaten some balls  taliesin you just bested a ball  marisha you busted a ball  ashley oh thats true /none/ thats true  sam weve all had a couple of balls in our mouth before  taliesin we spent six days in that happy fun ball  laura yeah  taliesin thats a lot of balls  marisha thats true im telling you its a ballthemed year  taliesin this is practically a ball pit yeah  liam matthew mercers ball campaign  marisha sorry  matt this is going to go real poorly  travis its not our fault  taliesin nice lightning strike as you said that by the way it was like  travis real poorly cracking /none/  matt this can be turned off  taliesin i was enjoying it  matt fun device  laura that is awesome yeah  matt thank you jeremy crawford for showing me that at the stream of many eyes  liam what is the plan captain  travis were going to head for the middle of all that  laura do we have to go to the bottom of the ocean again  travis maybe were going to keep our eyes on the islands as we proceed but i do recall it being  under the depths  marisha you /none/ are searching for this based on a vision  laura also it was in avantikas journal wasnt it you remember caleb  liam exactly  matt it was yes  sam did it have an exact location or anything  matt no it just said somewhere between them  travis in my dream i saw from the top down and i hit the water right in the middle of them and  kept going deeper and deeper  ashley right in the middle of these three islands  travis mmhmm  ashley cool  marisha fjord there are presumably three /none/ spheres yeah right  travis yeah  marisha you have one you have two and then avantika im checking if you think that this  could unleash ukotoa  travis nope nope nope she put hers in the first temple i have two this might be numero  dos and then ill keep the third  marisha okay what if theoretically playing devils advocate here maybe ukotoa was like i  should make four one extra just in caseies vandran has that one but hes also already put it  in the temple and this third one could unleash him /none/  travis wait four spheres three temples  laura its possible  sam or ten spheres  laura you dont know  sam you have no idea  marisha maybe it only takes three  taliesin im not sure that elder gods work in bakers dozens  liam it would be very embarrassing for the people who designed that temple we visited  travis thats right and as caleb can attest to that image that we saw in the temple was three  spheres three chosen people underneath the entity i dont think they would have an influx of  /none/ spheres to deal with  sam what if someone else was searching for these powerful spheres and maybe was lying in wait at  this temple knowing that someone would maybe come bring one to it  travis nott you are a fantastic rogue you wouldnt let such an ambush befall us would you  sam i would if it were underwater because i would not be there to prevent it  laura youre not going to come with us again  sam fuck no look what happened last time there was a crazy ghost lady  laura yeah and /none/ we defeated her  sam no she got away  laura yeah but we still defeated her  sam we almost died  laura we got the orb we also stole some shit  sam did we  laura yeah i got at least five gold  travis those that want to come can i will understand if you want to sit this one out  liam weve come a long way  taliesin youre welcome to stay although there might be a conversation about how much of the cut  of whatever we find you get to keep  /none/ travis agreed and i couldnt guarantee your safety up here while were below the murky depths  laura nott  sam yes  laura i dont want to force you to come of course not you can stay up here if you want and  im not going to talk about dangers and murky depths and stuff like that i will say that you  saved my life and i dont feel as comfortable going into a battle without you  sam fjord you have a thing or two to learn from jester about talking to people and engaging them /none/  on a personal level she has what i would call the expert touch she gets people she sees into their  hearts and souls you are just a bastard man  travis i hear there is an ancient button factory at the bottom of the waters  sam wait button wonkas factory with the boompaloompas  travis youve heard of it as well  sam i have no ones seen anyone come in or out of that factory and yet it makes buttons every  day how do they do it  travis the storys been lost to the /none/ ages since the great calamity  sam all right  travis youre in  sam this fucker  laughter  sam lets find it then well decide later  travis fair enough just in case can we keep an eye on the islands as were moving in for any sign  of structures civilization  matt yeah whoever is helming that will be able to make either two separate perception checks or  aid one to make  travis ill send the perceptive fuckers up to the crows nest  taliesin yep take a look  matt are you aiding /none/ caduceus or are you both rolling  marisha its you am i doing this  travis youre aiding cad  marisha ill aid you  taliesin perception rolls  matt perception yeah with advantage  taliesin perception with advantage thats awful thats terrible 14  matt okay you keep an eye out there and spend the next hour or so as you guys are coming into  position scanning the shores of each of the islands theres no sign of civilization theyre  mostly dangerous jagged rocky shores with pebbled beaches and bits and pieces of hints of  mangrove /none/ clusters at certain points of the shore and elements of the occasional bit of jungle you  can see in pockets or valleys on each island for the most part you dont see any sign of civilization  taliesin nothing so far mr caleb i know this is not your favorite thing to do but we may  require the use of your friend for a little while  liam what are you going to do with the cat  taliesin well i was hoping that maybe the cat would get uncomfortable in either a bird or an  octopus /none/ form and do a little reconnaissance  liam there is no bird or octopus he is a cat i am out of supplies for hes a cat  sam i got incense by the way  liam everything just changed how much did you get  sam i got 50 gold worth which was a lot  liam may i have it  sam you may have all of it  liam thank you where do we want to dump him in the ocean again for a look around  taliesin were looking for signs of civilization on land or /none/ in the sea at the moment what are you  travis if we havent seen anything on land id like to get in the middle and then send him below  marisha are we in the middle yet  matt id say about now you guys could have reached what would be considered as close to the  center as orly can possibly maneuver the boat  marisha no carvings in caves holes in the stone walls  liam i can do two things we can send frumpkin into the air and  matt i mean there are caves all /none/ over the volcanic rocky cliffs and peaks that come out  each island there are caverns and shelves it was a violentlymade series of islands  marisha did you go underwater in your vision  travis in my mind pictures yeah i did  taliesin your mind pictures  liam ill sit down on the deck and start drawing in chalk on the wood and putting my cat in the  middle of it even though he has only been a cat for a few days ten minutes later we have an octopus  laura wait so if i was /none/ petting frumpkin when you were doing that would he slowly lose his fur and  grow tentacles or would it be a poof  liam well try that sometime okay  laura okay  taliesin are you hoping for that ladyhawke moment where you have a furry octopus  travis yeah  ashley a furry octopus  taliesin one pat of just growling noise  matt there is a moment of transition its a little awkward  taliesin yowling then slurping  matt sploosh into the ocean  taliesin there you go bud  matt swishing below disappearing into the /none/ depths  marisha sorry go frumpkin go  matt go ahead and make a perception check for frumpkin  sam and laura come on frumpkin  liam not good  laura ugh its never good  liam eight  matt from the upper tier of the water frumpkin sees the water here is pretty clear  marisha he made it worse the water here is pretty clear  matt frumpkin is a bit distracted by the heavy schools of fish that seem to be glittering beneath  the surface and catching a little bit of the light thats making its /none/ way through the waves and  causing this array of sparkles roughly 30 40 50 feet below the surface  liam i see a whole lot of ocean  matt continues deeper deeper make another perception check  ashley come on frumpkin  liam 14  matt okay first thing frumpkin notices is the ocean here is not as deep as the divers grave it  goes down maybe 300 feet its still deep but its a third of the depth you ended up having to  go down  liam im going to send him in slowly larger circles /none/ over time  matt frumpkin does see a shape amongst the clusters of seaweed and other bits of life that  exist down there in natural ocean life you can see chunks of ocean rock and volcanic rock things  that may have been lobbed from ancient volcanic detonations and a tower a subocean tower thats  leaning at an angle you can see bits of broken rock based around it and the seaweed is cluttered  up around the base of it  liam now are we talking architecture or natural  matt architecture constructed  liam i relay /none/ this  matt the top of it is somewhat jagged it has sustained some erosion or damage towards its top  and it leads down inside you can see shelves or bits where there may have been stairs or levels  but most of that has fallen inward and from frumpkins exterior perspective mostly hollow and  disappearing into darkness the further in with a 14 frumpkin also notices a little bit of  movement towards the very tops of the seaweed there are humanoid bodies that are tangled in the  seaweed a bit that appear to be floating /none/ there and then one of them twitches and goes moaning  sam and laura oh no  marisha why does this keep happening  liam theres more dead things down below  taliesin oh man  laura oh no  sam nopey nope  travis well caduceus youre definitely coming  taliesin well we may need a nap before we go down there  travis all right  laura we did we got a long rest  marisha we just woke up  taliesin but since the yasha thing  matt yeah  laura yeah we still got a long /none/ rest  taliesin oh in that case im going to manage my spells then  marisha jagged tower seem familiar  travis yes  marisha okay  travis one thing we should do can i get you guys to scurry up to the crows nest one more time and  give a gander for any ships  marisha me and caduceus again  travis yeah look really carefully coves inlets anything that might look like it might be hiding  marisha want to do separate rolls this time  taliesin yeah lets do it separately  marisha fucking horrible  /none/ taliesin oh my god  travis totally fine were safe  marisha eight  taliesin ten  matt seems pretty clear  laura ugh  taliesin seems pretty clear  liam that towers familiar to you huh  travis no it just seems like the obvious entrance  liam so you misspoke  travis yeah  background music  liam okay  travis sorry my impulsiveness was starting to catch up again i just want to be honest sighs  doesnt seem like theres a trap nott right we seem to be by ourselves at least up here  sam /none/ yeah up here where theres no water were totally fine down there theres dead bodies on seaweed  laughter  travis yeah but i mean whats a couple of dead bodies on seaweed to people like us no bigs right  ashley wait theyre already dead theyre animated dead  marisha they were like menacing noises  matt fumpkin didnt get a great look at them it was uncertain one or the other but they appear to  be humanoid and wrapped in seaweed and then  liam one of them seemed to spasm  matt one of them seemed /none/ to twitch and move for a second before going back to rest  travis about what time of the day is it right now  matt at this point its early afternoon maybe one or two hours after noon  travis lets get this thing done  marisha do you have the ability to let us breathe under there  travis i do  sam yasha how are you feeling  travis up for another scrap  ashley i love swimming i like scrapping so this is a combo of the two of them you know im in  travis /none/ all right ill look at the group and i will cast underwater breathing on everyone for 24 hours  laura oh gosh  matt a familiar lightness in the lungs seems to take root inside the air tastes a little bit  different once the incantation is complete you feel the familiar point of anxiety build in your  chest since last time you dove  marisha its cold already groaning  sam im going to go find the other bottle of mead drink until i am more than intoxicated  marisha yelling that was for the crew  sam /none/ fuck them  marisha what nott  sam i need this right now  marisha your flask is bottomless  sam im kind of sick of it its the same booze over and over again im sorry i love you baby  i love you but its getting to be a little bit ugh its like if you eat rice krispies every day  taliesin maybe if you washed it every now and then it would have a slightly different  marisha do we see her go and sneak the mead  matt you see her leave for a bit /none/ and then come back with an empty bottle of mead  sam slurring lets go swimming  travis whats the distance from the middle of this archipelago to the nearest outer island  matt about a quarter mile a quarter mile to a mile to the nearest one actually its probably a  little more than that a few miles  travis ill go to orly and say while were underneath if you see another ship enter or  danger present itself make for land and well find you  matt understood yeah its about a mile to the shore /none/ looking at the map there  taliesin ill leave my tea kettle on board should be fine well find them  travis you ready  sam before we go im going to pull caleb aside  taliesin were all going to stare at you while you do this  sam hey while were down there if fjord tries to be like bad can you restrain him like if  something overcomes him with evil can you fuck him up  liam most likely yeah  sam i would be ready to i feel like 5050 hes turning evil on us /none/  liam will you stay close to me down there please  sam of course i will im not going to leave you youre puny and weak im sorry  laughter  sam i meant physically physically youre puny and weak intellectually youre a rock star  youre amazing you know i respect you  liam your first statement was accurate  sam by the way what did we get the books did we get any good spells  liam yeah  sam tell me  liam there was a jar full of theyre like boba its food  sam /none/ tapioca yeah  liam it lasts a long time  sam its just food  liam yeah  sam okay any sort of  liam the ink is good it will help me in my studies  sam and the books any powerful spells anything that can  liam one of the books was about debate one was a spell book  sam and  liam and theres useful things in it  sam reality shifting things  liam a little yeah  sam excellent i give him a big kiss on his cheek and its real smelly me not /none/ him  matt well  sam both  taliesin the book was about debate and then you were going to argue about  liam i pull her even a little further away and turn our backs to the group and  laura were all watching you  liam thats fine ive been getting a little wrapped up in this team were working as a team  and ive forgotten you and me ive forgotten  sam well dont were in this together  liam yeah  sam dont forget me i wont forget you  liam stay close  sam /none/ always all right fuckers lets go  travis when we get under make sure to take a breath really quick youll sink faster  sam oh yeah  marisha if ukotoa decides to show up  travis he wont  laura but if he does  marisha whats the plan  travis he wont  marisha doubtfully okay  liam caleb is standing behind beauregard and sliding his octopus onto his head  marisha still cool  laura looking good  taliesin its a look  marisha all right  travis heavy footsteps splash  taliesin no fear  marisha /none/ seals dive  matt one by one you all make your way into the ocean splashing the water is cold but you  adjust and begin to find your way down are we swimming stealthily or are we brazenly heading  towards this temple  liam always stealthily  laura stealth  matt all right so were stealth missioning in i need everybody to go ahead and make a stealth  check please  laura natural 20 straight up light up  liam is anybody putting some juice on this no straight roll  taliesin no straight roll  laura /town/ oh ill give you a blessing of the trickster  liam thanks thats plus ten  travis 13  laura thats advantage  liam advantage  marisha 12  liam oh theyre both good now even better 20  sam 23  laura natural 20  taliesin six  ashley 14  matt okay  marisha super middle of the road  matt youre moving at a slower speed swimming below trying to be as stealthy as you can making  your way further down the filtering light grows dimmer and dimmer  laura oh i left the weasel on /dung/ the ship again i didnt bring him with me  matt theres a certain point where i assume youre not trying to kill your weasel  laura yeah im not going to kill my weasel  matt i fucked with you for a few weeks when you were new to pet ownership but then after a few  close calls i figured the deeper it goes the harder it is to see the colder it is a familiar sensation  marisha is it as dark as it was before equally  travis its clear water  matt its clear water /none/ so the light does carry further and you guys arent going as deep you do  manage to make out as you get further and further down the general shape of the tower within sight  it is comparatively murky because of the lack of light but you can see the shape you can also  based on the warning that caleb had given see some of the figures you see about five of them  all tangled or wrapped in threads of this seaweed regular seaweed not the strange crimson type that  you came across in the divers /none/ grave  taliesin im going to do a little ping of eyes of the grave just to make sure theres no more of  them in this other than the ones we can see  matt whats the range on that  taliesin 60 feet  matt all right youre going to have to get pretty close to try it  taliesin i know that were heading once i feel like or maybe i should hit it again  matt okay as you swim down to get within range to use your eyes of the grave thankfully the  nearest /none/ creature doesnt seem to notice your approach it is not undead make a perception check  taliesin come on ah better 20  matt actually roll at disadvantage because you dont have darkvision unfortunately and youre  low enough now where the light is limited  taliesin 16  matt 16s still okay now that you have a better look at it at a closer perspective the humanoid  creature no clothing it is thin the limbs are a little stretched but there are tiny fins at the  edge of the arms along the sides of the head there /none/ are gills it has a strange glance looking  around like a sentry almost its not undead it appears to be more of a fish person  travis does it look like it has four appendages  matt it has four appendages it has arms and legs  taliesin yeah i would have gotten an undead ping from any of them i didnt get an undead ping  matt nope whats interesting is that one of its lower appendages its right leg as youre  watching curls up and then unfurls one of its legs seems to move similarly to /none/ one of the  appendages of frumpkin  travis oh no  matt just one the others appear to be human  sam one person or one limb  matt one limb  laura its like the snake people on the other island  marisha thats some cthulhuian shit  sam they all have one octopus tentacle  matt well the nearest one you saw has you arent close enough to the others to make out what  their physical representation is  taliesin im relaying that to everybody very quietly  laura where do we go fjord  matt /none/ you have five here that are watching you have to decide what is it going to be is it a  brazen attack is it some form of a stealth mission what are you doing  travis and marisha quietly  ashley thats a good idea  sam should we make a distraction or anything  matt theyre clustered enough around where theyre not going to not see you you have nothing  youre hiding behind  travis we cant halo drop in this bitch  matt no a stealth mission in this would be invisibility you would have to /none/ do something where  they cannot see you otherwise theyre going to see you  marisha quick and fast  travis yeah we can pair up  marisha and sam buddy system  laura i say we all attack each one until each one is dead we dont spread it out too much  sam one at a time  laura focus on  marisha the people  laura yeah  travis or at least two theres five  marisha are they for sure going to attack us  travis pretty sure they look like theyre on the look yeah /none/  marisha bad super bad there are five  laura yeah i could invoke duplicity down there and see if they attack us if they do then we can  attack them  taliesin it looks dangerous i think its worth  laura just going for it  travis whos got a good range whos got some good pop on a good range you  liam well i can hit for sure but  travis does the water do anything to it  liam no  laura how spread out are they  matt i mean theyre not a perfect /none/ ring of five around the top theyre all hanging right towards  the top of the tower from the different layers of seaweed theyre anywhere from 15 to 20 feet from  each other their arrangement is a bit uneven  liam theyre wrapped up in the seaweed  matt mmhmm  liam are we sure we want to make a hit on these things that are tangled up as opposed to this one  that is free floating  travis there is one that is free  matt looking at them all it looks like theyre less wrapped and /none/ tangled and more like they have  an arm or a leg that theyve curled around it and are anchoring themselves to it  marisha like seahorses  matt kind of  travis how close do you need to be caleb  liam not that close  travis im more of a fan of them coming to us frankly  liam little over a hundred feet away  travis lets get in range of whatever caleb needs to do and then lets break off into three and four  sam were not on the floor of the sea were above /none/ them  matt youre above them  travis they can pick but theyve got to come to us  liam well you tell me as far as im concerned youre calling the shots here  travis lets get within whatever you need 120 feet 100 feet well try to stealth within that range  matt okay caduceus has made that journey as you continue to push in that direction you get to the  exterior of that range they seem to have not noticed your presence yet  travis spread out 30 feet between us the two groups clerics with /none/ each group  taliesin ill stick with you  marisha i will not go with yasha because sentinel and sentinel  laura ill go with beau  sam how about we four and the outside three  marisha okay  liam i could either focus what im going to do on one of them or i could tickle all of them  travis all of them at the same time  liam it would just get their attention it would not solve anything  travis wizards choice how about just one and you pick  liam okay well i will /dung/ aim for the one closest i begin to weave my hands underwater and cast  magic missile  sam i will simultaneously fire a crossbow bolt  taliesin just for fun ill add into this with a sacred flame  matt all towards the same target  laura yeah  travis ill also send eldritch blast  taliesin see if we can knock one out  liam im casting at 2ndlevel  matt okay those that need to roll attacks roll attacks those that need to roll damage roll damage

breathing under the water watches this glimmer of arcane energy its  attention turns up towards it as it /none/ releases the seaweed then multiple explosions and goes limp  under the water as a small cloud of its own blood begins to fill the space around it at which  point the other four look up and notice your presence from the lights that have been glowing  and the death of one of its comrades  marisha next target maybe  matt roll initiative  marisha natural one  matt ooh not good well not good for them either 25 to 20  taliesin is that with advantage oh  ashley yeah that first one was good

have to be close  taliesin can you get down there and hold an action  matt your movement is halved when youre swimming except for fjord  ashley say again  matt your movement is halved while youre swimming just so you know you guys are about a  /none/ hundred feet away so its going to take a little bit to get there for the melee folk  travis two one  marisha yeah five total for me  travis oh well then you top me  marisha dude what you rolled a two  travis yeah plus zero  matt caleb youre up first caleb and jester the four of them now begin to quickly swim up in  your direction they swim fast they swim faster than you do at the very least  marisha well that makes sense  matt about as fast as fjord does /none/  travis 30 feet  matt yep you can see their webbed fingers and the spines and the scales of their arms and legs  they look like the creature from the black lagoon with a little bit of a slight more humanoid nose  and mouth theyre now clambering up towards you in the water what are you guys doing  laura guiding bolt at the one coming closest  matt okay same one or different target  liam no im nibbling on some licorice root and casting haste on fjord and backing away  sam haste on fjord /none/ oh my god  travis whoa  matt it rolled a natural 20 again on its saving throw two natural 20s in a row oh no this is  guiding bolt never mind he doesnt roll anything wasted natural 20 matt well done its  okay roll your attack  taliesin well done youve already helped  laura 14  matt 14 yeah that hits their armor class is 11  taliesin whoa good to know very low armor class easy to hit which is usually dangerous  theyre going to be trouble when they get in there  laura /dung/ okay 14 points of radiant damage  matt 14 points of radiant damage it bursts and glows underneath its still alive you see the  blood splatter and it has this glowing energy surrounding its torso making it easy to see in  the dark depths below awesome that finished your turn you cast haste that ends your guys round  and youre backing away yasha your turn  ashley i am going to move as much as i can getting closer to them  matt okay so movement of 15 feet dash 15 feet thatd be your full round /none/ there get you 30 feet  down so youre about 60 or so well no your movement speed is 40 so its 20 20 yeah youre  about 60 feet away  taliesin do you want to have an action held though  ashley yeah im going to hold my action until one of them either yeah they get close to me  matt youll only move 20 feet then so youre 80 feet away got it okay youre holding your  action to hit whenever it comes close all right that finishes your turn caduceus youre up  taliesin /none/ im going to move just behind yasha are any of them within range at this point  matt what range  taliesin 30 or 60  matt no theyre about a hundred feet away they havent taken their turn yet  taliesin then im going to hold a spell until theyre within range  matt what spell are you holding  taliesin im going to hold bane  matt okay finishes your go nott youre up  sam oh me im going to swim well no i have ranged attacks so im going to just pick one the  one /none/ that jester missed  matt whats your interior range with your weapon  sam oh 30 no ive been rolling at disadvantage for its 30 or 120 from the tinkertop  boltblaster i rolled at disadvantage last time  taliesin underwater  laura no because a crossbow you dont roll at disadvantage  sam its ranged disadvantage  matt correct automatically misses a target beyond the weapons normal range you dont roll  disadvantage for the first half the first 30 feet but anything beyond 30 feet is an automatic  miss because at that point it loses momentum and /none/ cant keep traveling  sam oh underwater oh i did not know that  matt which you just learned  sam oh well then i didnt hit the first one  matt you didnt need to you guys fucking destroyed it before it came to you it was  already dead  sam it has to be within 30 underwater to hit  matt youve learned  sam i still do disadvantage  matt no you do not roll disadvantage if its ranged  sam okay got it i fire and nothing happens  matt it goes shearing and just /none/ floats  sam oh shit ill start going towards it  matt okay so you swim 15 feet you can bonus action dash if you want  sam yes i will bonus action dash to make it 30 feet  matt 30 feet in that gets there now its their turn they all doublemove 60 feet as they swim  upwards getting as close as they can that definitely gets them in range for your spell  taliesin im going to hit three of them with bane  matt you were 80 feet so no one gets into range with /none/ you so bane youre hitting three of them  with bane  taliesin three of them with bane its a charisma saving throw  matt okay theres three of them that have

ill take that one ill swim  matt you move towards the one that is glowing you swim down thats 20 feet so youre still 20  feet away  travis is it just hers at advantage or all attacks against it  taliesin just the first one  marisha i will spend a ki point to do swim of the wind  matt thats the additional 20 feet that will get you right into range of the one jester hit its  like snarling as you get really up close to it now with the glowing light /none/ around it you get a  good look at its face its covered in layers of scales and spined points that come out at various  points of its facial features its eyes are yellow and a sick little side lens that closes  laura ew xfiles  marisha punch jesus christ  matt you have advantage because of the guiding bolt  marisha right thank you jester ooh thats much better 18  matt 18 hits  marisha ill use my fist  matt oh but you do have disadvantage underwater with melee attacks however so it cancels out /none/  what was your first roll  marisha it was a three plus seven so ten  matt ten misses that first strike just its too slow  marisha second attack almost a natural 20 but it wasnt 13  matt 13 hits  marisha oh thats fun  laura

claws or this would be a bite it  grabs and bites towards you  taliesin reduced to half  matt /none/ oh no its a strike so bludgeoning its halved to three you take three points of  bludgeoning damage this one is going to attempt to grab you with the tentacle natural 20  taliesin does he get a bonus for that natural 20 does he get some sort of bonus to that natural 20  does that make something better about that  matt you dont know  taliesin i mean because im going to cancel it if it does anything  matt its a critical hit up to you are you canceling it or not  taliesin im /none/ canceling it  matt okay it still hits but its not a critical you take eight points of bludgeoning  damage reduced to four and you are grappled as its tentacle reaches around you another one that  looks like it has a protrusion from its chest almost like a third arm its a tentacle that  wraps around and grabs at your torso and is crushing you you can feel faint bits of it that  are scraping at the skin that finishes their turn beau youre up  marisha the one in front of me is dead i /none/ head to the next one how far away  matt theres the one that was attacking you thats right in your face and theres the one  thats grappled yasha with a tentacle  sam a different one swam up to you  marisha yashas fine ill hit the one in front of me  matt go for it two attacks with disadvantage  marisha first attack

a lot 12  matt 12 points of damage its jaw snaps out of place it looks like its trying to bite towards  you but its jaw is limply unable to close  marisha its still going  matt its still going

right and your final attack  marisha i was looking at my wrong thing hits and one more time please die six  matt okay /none/ with the last hit as its jaw snapped apart you grab its head and ram it into your  knee and as you pull the leg back the face is collapsed inward and it goes limp  laura eww  marisha i do that thing where i try to water current its bloody guts away from me so im not  inhaling it  matt like oh god okay that finishes your go fjord  travis how many are up still  matt one left and it currently has yasha grappled in the tentacle and trying to crush her  /none/ travis so heres a question that very first one that we lit up like the godfather  matt yep  travis with my bonus action can i reach out since i was part of the killing of are these  creatures humanoids  matt they are  travis can i reach forward and go in a demonic voice rise and ill accursed specter the creature  matt you may as the body is floating in the water away this cold sensation takes the nearby  20foot radius around it what little bit of light is filtering through here gets darker /none/ and a  darkened spectral form emerges from its body this ghostly wraith emerges from the corpse under  fjords command  travis ill say that and go concussion sound and throw two more eldritch blasts at the one  thats remaining  matt go for it  travis thats a 24  matt that hits  travis the other one is a 14  matt that hits damage on both  travis singing this is the age of aquarius thats ten points and eight so 18  matt 18 points of damage both bolts impact sounds into it its /none/ damaged but its still  holding on and its turning towards  travis great ill take my speed and rush at it  matt dash in with the blade out at the side  travis take a strike  matt make your strike  travis oh dope 16  matt you do not have disadvantage because of your armor so that hits go ahead and roll damage with  your blade  travis 1d8 plus two points of damage one plus one  sam nice  matt well  travis its 1d8 plus one  matt dont you get to /none/ add your charisma modifier to the damage bonus  travis i dont see that on here  matt pretty sure as a hexblade warlock you get to add your charisma bonus to attack and damage  rolls right am i wrong about that  travis i aint been doing it  matt you have in the past im pretty sure unless im reading this wrong  travis i thought it would be added into the weapon naturally  marisha dd beyond  matt it should be  travis yeah it just says 1d8 plus one  sam call tech support /none/  matt yeah its based on your strength maybe it updated recently and that got reset  travis okay  matt ill have to double check because  travis my charisma bonus is four  matt correct  laura so it would be five more points of  matt well it should be an additional plus four damage is what it should be  travis yeah so it would be six on a two  matt yeah right ill fix that  travis okay  matt okay after the two impacts and the sword slicing through it its still standing /none/ but its  hurt its still holding onto yasha and right now its distracted trying to figure out which way to  go that finishes your go fjord  travis mmhmm  matt caleb and jester youre up next  liam whats left whats  matt theres one holding onto yasha  liam oh magic missile  laura toll the dead at the same time  marisha yeah  matt that is a 13 on its toll the dead  laura ah doesnt save  matt and the 12 damage  liam yeah  laura oh 22 points  matt /none/ ooh  taliesin jesus  laura of tolling bell damage through the water  matt as the tentacle is grappling and crushing your body and youre trying to find a way to force  your way through suddenly the tentacle just pulls away you look over towards it the tentacle  isnt attached to anything it is turned to chum in the water as bits of its scattered body begin  to slowly dissipate and disseminate throughout the nearby sea  laura the toll the dead vibrations going through the water so all of us can feel it  matt /none/ thrumming magic missiles impacting and scattering its form currently there doesnt  appear to be any of these creatures around you theres just the darkness of the tower below and  whatever the inside of it holds  laura go team  sam that was good anyone need healing  marisha im good  ashley im fine  travis we have a friend  marisha what  travis ill bring the specter forward  matt its hard to see this low in the water when theres so little light when its not moving once  it shifts its like watching /none/ a shadow out of the corner of your eye with these two faintly dull  glowing yellow eyes its vaguely humanoid in its shape but its almost smoky and amorphous when it  shifts and moves and finds its place nearby its head lolls around a bit mimicking the shape and  the movement of the creature before it was engaged in combat  travis i feel bad having frumpkin be the one thats always putting himself in harms way  thought id give him a friend ill send the specter towards the mouth of the tower  matt okay /none/ you sending it in there by itself  travis mmhmm  matt okay  ashley oh why  matt you guys watch as the specter vanishes into the shadow of the tower below  sam does anything happen  laura can you see through its eyes like frumpkin  travis nope  sam just send him away  travis i just wanted to send him to the entrance  matt oh just the entrance  travis yeah just to the front  matt okay it moves comes to the top  travis just to make sure the towers not like /none/ violent chomping  matt no it does not open its maw and devour your specter  travis dont make that face i wouldnt put that past you for one second  matt fair enough yeah it drifts in and once it hits the mouth of it its near impossible to see  because its just black on black until you see its head turn and you can see the very faint light of  its eyes it sits there awaiting its next command its making you uncomfortable  taliesin yeah no im pretty uncomfortable about all of this yeah  /none/ travis its not a permanent thing  taliesin this is definitely getting very afterschool special for me and the kid just  brought out the bag of weed in the afterschool special and im like oh  travis just give it a try  taliesin oh the police officer came to our school and talked about this okay  travis ruhroh hey kids  taliesin no sighs yeah all right lets do this  laura theres no other entrance on the tower just the one that we see  matt as far as you can tell there is just the /none/ one entrance  travis yeah well move closer  matt if you want to try and swim along the edges of it you can look for other entrances  liam hold on a minute go look around the tower  matt perception check for frumpkin please  liam yeah hell spiral around look for any other entrances oh jeez it jumped on the box  cocked natural one  matt okay frumpkin having a hard time seeing through the clustered seaweed around its base i  mean with a natural one yeah you dont see anything frumpkin makes out no /none/ shapes or anything  within that period frumpkins not used to being an octopus okay he still hasnt quite figured it out  liam thats what ive been saying all this time  travis im a bit faster ill go  liam i summon my octopus back to my head  matt okay  travis hang back for a second ill use 45 feet of my speed to move forward  matt youre not in combat right now so we can just  travis im still fucking hasted  matt thats true though youre getting really close to the end /none/ of it it lasts for a minute so  travis oh does it sorry  liam we did some talking  matt you guys have been chatting back and forth and doing this and especially with frumpkin  looking around like that yeah haste has worn off  travis now i have one level of exhaustion right  matt no you just get stunned for a round but youre not in combat anymore  liam you just went gasping and then its gone  matt yeah a little heart palpitation moment okay are you going to do a spiral around /none/ it or  are you going to go down one side what are you doing are you just stopping  travis are we above it  matt you guys are above it at this point youre about 60 or so feet above the top of this curved tower  travis its at an angle right  matt its at a slight angle yeah  liam travis how are you going to handle the shaft  travis id like to spiral down slowly making my way around the top so i can see  matt okay are you doing it stealthily /none/ or are you trying to go for speed  travis stealthily  matt all right itll take you a little bit but go ahead and roll a stealth check  liam start at the base  laura oh i give bless you  sam mocking laura in gibberish  travis what is that for  laura you get advantage  travis i do get advantage  matt yeah blessing of the trickster  travis thats good ugh nine  marisha nein  matt all right make a perception check for me please as youre keeping an eye out  laura /none/ im also keeping an eye out to see if i see anything come out of the front entrance  matt okay make a perception check  travis 16  matt all right as you curl down there are slits there are narrow peering points at  different areas you do see the occasional window or an opening where somebody could probably  squeeze through at the very base of it there does appear to be an open doorway  travis the top of the tower is open and it continues through the middle  matt correct  laura 17 perception /none/  matt okay youre keeping an eye out from the top as you head down you see that entranceway  look over look around and see the other faint bits of windows you look back down at the door  and you see the very edge of something in the door you see a yellowishgreen shape looks  almost best i can describe it at this distance is a hint of crustacean that then vanishes into  the doorway  travis i swim over to the edge of the tower to try and lean up against the side of it /none/ make  myself less obvious out in the open water  matt okay you wait for 30 seconds a minute  travis does somebody appear  matt nothing but you get the sense that something noticed you  travis well dont want to go in that way i wave everybody down  marisha i swim down  matt okay you all join fjord  travis i will relay that there is a doorway down near the bottom but something poked its pretty  head out  laura what did it look like  travis kind of greenishyellow couldnt quite see /none/ but it kind of looked like an overgrown  shrimp crabtype thing kind of crustaceany  laura thats weird  travis yeah might just be the local wildlife right what are the chances we could just send  our guest here down  laura see if it attacks it sure  travis or we could go through the tunnel  liam maybe we could send your friend in the door at the bottom while we go in the top  laura yeah  travis id be fine with that i will command the specter to move towards the doorway and /none/ engage  anything it finds  matt okay the specter drifts down to the center of the doorway and hangs there  travis just at the doorway  laura what does that mean what did that delayed reaction mean  travis i push him inside  matt okay the specter vanishes inside  travis commotion  matt make a perception check  laura ugh  travis balls ass three  matt yeah you dont hear anything caduceus just instinctually you hear what sounds like the  thrashing of water the impact of scraping against stone more thrashing then silence  /none/ taliesin i think that was the end of your ghost friend  travis i dont know theyre pretty resilient but okay  sam yeah maybe he won  taliesin no that was the end  travis well lets assume then shall we assume flanking positions  laura are we going in the top tunnel or the bottom  travis you know if its crustaceany and its treating this tower as a shell maybe i dont want  to fight it in there  liam what do you propose  marisha i mean it feels like this stuff is always at /none/ the bottom or at the end  travis how about we drop to the floor about 60 feet from the doorway and send in a care package  laura oh attacks  travis yeah anything ranged  laura okay  travis see if we get lucky  laura all right  travis ill descend to the floor keeping about 60 feet from the outside of the doorway  laura follow behind him and land  matt okay youre both now resting a distance from it  marisha can i because ive got shit when it comes to range cheat the /none/ distance and see if i  can peek in from the top of the tower down  matt make a perception check  marisha while they do this okay 18  matt with a lack of light you have your goggles which helps you can barely make out  shapes and theres a few of them its like looking into a boiling pot where theres shapes  shifting in different places clustered with what little bit you can see at your peripheral its  like whatever texture the bottom of this temple has the texture is moving  ashley how /none/ many feet down did you say from the top  matt from the top its about 60 feet  marisha while you guys sink i went and peeked through one of those windows and looked down  ashley can i try and giving a looksee too because i have darkvision  matt sure  marisha i do too  ashley oh you already have it  marisha go ahead you might roll higher than i did  ashley what would the roll be is it perception  matt mmhmm  ashley 16  matt you make out the same thing /none/  liam i poof a little globule of light in my hand and motion to beauregard from far away and go  taliesin i mean they already know were here  marisha i look at yasha what do you think light or no  liam i make three more  ashley they do know were here  marisha okay i go over to caleb and yasha and i look in as he sends them in  matt do you send them in  liam how tall is the tower roughly  matt its a little more than 60 feet tall /none/ to the peak  liam okay so i will stay 50 or 60 feet away from the
