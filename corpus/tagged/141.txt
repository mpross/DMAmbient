matt all right great so without further ado and no further delaying the inevitable  travis you got a little something on your  matt little thing on my nose right there  travis /town/ you might need to go the bathroom check it out  matt no its great so lets go ahead and roll the intro and start playing critical role  dramatic music  matt so continuing where we left off two weeks ago the intrepid party of adventurers known as  vox machina after recently freeing the town of westruun from being occupied and ruled by the  roving herd of the storm which grog once hailed from cut down their brutal leader kevdak and  temporarily restored power to a combination of himself and kevdaks son zanror an accord was /town/  made between the two of you to agree to go after and destroy the ancient black dragon umbrasyl a  member of the chroma conclave and marked for you to eventually destroy anyway but who had  currently made a deal with the herd in exchange for goods gold and ruling over the town would  let them live and be essentially undisturbed seemingly you gathered an army you forged a  plan and an ambush was set for the next time the dragon swooped down from atop the mountain  gatshadow to retrieve its package at this time /none/ the trap was sprung the dragon held fast by hooks  and chains a giant metallic trap designed and orchestrated by percival and everything was going  great the dragon had sustained quite a bit of damage and seemed to be in a rough place until it  broke free and left much of the herd fallen dissolving and screaming also scanlan and vax  dimension doord into the inside of the dragon and have spent a number of rounds now deciding how to  get out of it maybe  sam tiny vax tiny vax  matt tiny vax /none/ thanks to a potion that does that you managed to go ahead and put in an immovable  rod within its stomach which held it up for a moment before it decided to truly gain the  advantage it needed to escape the circumstance allowed it to tear through its body as well as an  arrow that was shot by vex towards her brother in hopes of i dont know being a signal of hope or  to put him out of his misery im still trying to figure it out at this point in time umbrasyl  took /none/ to the sky and began to coast off towards gatshadow seemingly the domain that its carved  for itself in this region on its way out grog had thrown his newly acquired bloodaxe and his  chain of returning into the dragon left it and is now being dragged behind it now dangling as it  flies off and that my friends is where we kick back into the story  travis thats when they knew they fucked up  laughter  matt so we have as you guys grog your feet leave the ground as you swing forward unable /none/ by  the momentum pushing forward to keep up with the sheer speed of this dragon and its size its mass  its full stretched wings it is far faster than any of you expected and it whooshes off towards  the mountaintop you just looking behind as the ground just fades further and further away the  rest of you vox machina seeing this happen see essentially half of your friends your party only  one of them visible now beyond your reach with that being said for this circumstance lets pick  up where we were on the /none/ initiative order between you three  laura just straight into it  matt yeah  travis im ready  matt we left at the right time for that guys  liam i cannot feel the lower half of my body  laughter  matt here how about this because i cant find the original initiative order well just say for  this circumstance well roll initiative based on what actions going to happen here so were going  to have you three roll initiative  travis come on lucky dice i get advantage on that  sam i got 12 /none/  liam 13  travis 13 also  laura oh jeez  sam starting off right  matt all right so as it crests into the sky whoosh blackish dragon blood dripping from  wounds you can feel every single tension of its upper torso muscles with each swoop of the wings  crushing against you in this rhythmic pattern what little bit of air currently has been placed  at the top of the stomach based on your thunderwave is all you have to maintain any  semblance of hope you theres an arrow in darkness however umbrasyl at /none/ this point who  does go first in this order is just concentrating on survival and continues gliding upward you hear  a rumble within the inside of the body and the essence of a growling angry voice creeps through  these foul creatures get out of me straining sound i need you guys to both roll strength  saving throws right now  laura hes trying to puke you up  sam or just crush us  liam strength saving nine  sam yeah not great 15  matt 15 you manage to put your arms against the side /none/ and using whatever forceful arcane cantrips  to keep the walls at bay before it actually finds you and you slip out in time you however do  suffer six points of bludgeoning damage as the muscles once again tense against you umbrasyl is  very much aware that there are now living things inside the stomach squirming around and as the  muscles relax the voice just growls again try all you want dont worry i can eat you now or later  liam cant hear you  matt so we had two 13s and a  sam 12 /none/  matt 12 all right so grog vax what are you guys doing  liam im taking  matt the bramblewood is now beneath you youre heading towards the mountain you can see the edge  of the forest now  travis maybe i go first just in case something  liam yeah go for it  travis the bramblewood im holding on right with the titanstone knuckles whereabouts is the  axe lodged can i see where the chain is attached to  matt you can see it curving up ahead of you and with how high the sun /none/ is in the sky its around  noon theres a heavy bit of shadow and at this distance make a perception check  travis laughs that went one and then a 13 minus zero 13  matt 13 it seems to be somewhere around the base of the tail like where the tail meets the rest of  the actual body itself the torso area  laura its in his butt  matt no its not quite in his butt its more in his side  travis how high am i  matt looking down numbers are hard for you /none/ to pick up its a long way  travis a long way  matt its a long way like yeah  travis well only one way to go and thats up i would like to try and pull myself up the chain  towards umbrasyl  matt all right go ahead and make an athletics check  travis athletics or strength  matt athletics which is better technically  laura its a strength saving thing so  matt yeah its strength plus your proficiency bonus  travis oh i get an advantage or  matt you get your proficiency bonus /none/ youre no longer raging because this is more fearstruck at  this point  travis oh 14 plus five 19  matt 19 yeah you begin to ascend the chain you get closer to it and you can now see the axe  itself is embedded and is starting to wiggle and pull out so youre making your way up the chain  with the full round at this point youre almost to it but thats going to be the rest of your  action this turn  travis yeah okay  matt so what are you doing  liam /none/ im taking the dragon sword and i am shoving it along the angle of the arrow thats coming in  toward it to try to go parallel  matt okay the arrowhead is still poking through  liam through and im sending it along that line  matt okay okay all right go ahead and make a general dexterity check to see if youre able to  liam natural 20  cheering  matt okay using the essence of where the actual shaft of the arrow has pierced the hide and is  stuck through you take the blade and /none/ use your understanding of precision weapons and implements  to find the slight opening and the blade thankfully is very thin slide it through with  minimal resistance you can see the muscles are still pushing against it but the already preset  wound from the arrow does guide it through and you manage to go straight to the hilt and its  found its way all the way through the wound no additional damage is dealt necessarily but it has gone  liam this does not count as an attack on the creature  matt you said you wanted /none/ to put it through an existing hole  liam the hole is this thick  matt yeah  liam like a straw and the blade is this thats not piercing damage theres no piercing damage  whatever you want  matt do you want to roll an attack for this  liam yes i want it to be an attack  matt right now you would make the attack as the blade the idea being that you wanted to guide it  through the hole  liam im going to use one of my lucks ive got two left better /none/  matt didnt you use any luck for the battle  liam i used one last time  matt right so you have two left  liam 12 plus strength which is low is 14 the dragon sword is the dragon sword plus anything  guys i dont know that i have the  matt plus one  liam plus one all right  matt yeah and then it does additional damage against dragons  liam oh and i have to roll ill just say i missed for my bonus action im going to slide  the dagger up along /none/ the same line and try to widen that gap  matt okay this roll will be at disadvantage  liam the last one was too which is why i just scrubbed it  matt right right right go ahead and make the secondary attack  liam no  matt yeah okay so the blade is in there and it has found its way through the existing  wound but you dont quite have the strength to actually wrench it enough to do any real serious  damage as it is a very very hardy and welldefended creature from its natural /none/ mass the  fleshy interior of a dragon is almost as dense and as protected as the armored hide on the outside  and thats one thing you werent counting on when entering its form  liam and what did i just do though with the dragon sword did i widen the hole  matt youve put the blade through the hole and so now you have that blade lodged in you can then  use that to try and widen it in successive turns in itself and that will prevent you from having  disadvantage on the attacks with /none/ that blade going forward because its already in a soft place and  you can just wedge it but its going to be a strength attack for each of those rounds the  dagger unfortunately you just cant find any purchase at that point there in the time given  because of the movement and the squishing you do also suffer an additional seven points of crushing  damage  liam okay and i forgot one other thing i want to do i have movement too can i use my legs to  push as hard as i can forward /none/ a foot or something i know with movement over difficult terrain its  halved and im in the most difficult terrain  matt you are in the most difficult terrain there probably is  liam but if i use my movement could i shove and go like a foot towards the outside half a foot or  anything  matt pushing towards the wound  liam pushing in using my legs to go  matt okay i would say that would be part of your attack next round actual movement within you  would be able to move a few /none/ feet but youd have to release the blade to do so any actual blade  pushing forward would be your next action so hold off for the next round scanlan what you got  sam oi so im in a beast as we all know intestines are my favoured terrain  laughter  travis i remember him saying that years ago  matt this is true  laura back when we first made these characters i remember you saying that  sam so i held up that rod clicked it and then it was pulled out of the body pretty /none/ close to  where i am right now when it went did i see air did i see daylight when it went out of there  matt it was very small its the equivalent of a bullet going through because the rod when it  punched through it didnt its a very thin elongated object so it pierced through like a  metal rod at a very high speed  liam so the dragon got very lucky and it went through like that and not like that  matt if it would have hit at whatever angle it would be /none/ even then its only that wide and it  would still puncture a tiny slit and due to the density of both the muscles of the creature and  its body it took damage and theres a little bit of blood coming from the wound you imagine but  its not like its going to leave an open cavernous hole  sam its a cut  matt yeah its a cut  sam got it  matt but you did see where it tearing noise through  sam and when it went out i didnt see any daylight or anything /none/ just disappeared  matt you just saw it tearing noise through the creatures stomach you do see a little bit of  blood beginning to pour out of where the wound was  sam okay oh boy  travis do it baby  sam i dont know i got nothing all right ill just try something and well see if it works and  then ill try something else next time i wont die in one round right im going to polymorph  into a tri notaceratops into a small poisonous snake  matt okay  sam and im going /none/ to go straight into that wound  matt okay well before that happens you do take four points of acid damage from the stomach before  you take the form because that would be the top of the round so at which point you turn into a  small poisonous snake now floating amongst the acids and find your way along the surface and  youre heading towards the wound  sam im going into the wound  matt okay all right  sam with a swim speed of 30  matt right you do  laughter  matt let /none/ me check  sam but i dont know if its swimming its more squeezing  matt through the acid its swimming once you get to the actual wound this is more squeezing  and thats going to be more of a strengthbased element so that being the case here a poisonous  snake im going to need you to go ahead and roll a strength check to push against the wound  sam sure man this is a strong snake  laura really  sam natural one  laughter  matt which just as a heads up is a minus /none/ four to its strength so thats technically a negative three  sam bink going well guys  matt yeah you just dive in headfirst and with all your snaky might you slither and slither and  slither just getting nowhere no headway this is bad  laughter  liam why dont you bite it dude  sam oh yeah sure ill take a bite  liam poisonous bite  matt sure go for it roll for an attack  sam 14 plus i have no idea  matt plus five  sam hey thats a 19 that doesnt hit  /none/ matt a 19 the inside of the stomach is not as wellarmored as outer parts of the body a 19  would hit go ahead and roll damage  sam what do i roll  matt this would be oh no you dont roll it takes one piercing damage  laughter  sam guys we knocked it down a point  matt and it has to make a constitution saving throw versus your poison thats an eight plus 14  at a dc of ten so yeah it doesnt take any additional oh it takes half damage so go ahead /none/  and roll 2d4  sam ooh seven  matt it takes three points of poison damage  laughter  sam and it is considered grappled okay plan a cross it off the list  laughter  matt all right top of the round okay so umbrasyl is still flying up looking down at its  form is glancing about  travis dont see me dont see me  laura youre in its butt how can it see you  matt grog as youre holding onto the axe you see before you just pass underneath the leg and  the /dung/ front arms that are reaching down this giant dark looming projection comes down and looks  right towards you the horned front of the dragon as umbrasyl stares right into your face and goes  there you are draws in breath exhales and unleashes a torrent of acid towards you i need  you to go ahead and make this is going to roll a dexterity saving throw you have disadvantage  travis i do  matt because youre currently holding onto the chain but i believe you have advantage on them  because you are a barbarian  travis /none/ i have danger sense so just one roll  matt yeah so just roll  travis thats not great 11  ashley can i do i see them  matt no they are way over theyre like a tiny little dragon speck in the distance well get to  you guys here in just a moment but their situation is a little more dire and immediate so  i have to figure out whats going on with them right now  laura what if we couldve chased after them right away  matt you can if you want to did /none/ you want to go after them  laura and taliesin yeah  laura i would have chased after them immediately when it took off  matt okay well get to that in just a minute as it is the dragons speed is it can fly 80 feet  per round  laura thats really fast though  matt yeah and its making doubledash manoeuvring here even at your fly speed on the broom  laura what do great eagles have giant eagles i think have really fast speed too  matt lets check that real fast giant eagles  marisha /none/ 80  matt 80 feet so the eagles are able to keep up do you want something that way  laura so if the eagles were to pick up somebody  matt first off grog you take 62 points of acid damage  travis nice  laura wait you have acid resis no you dont because keyleth it went away  travis it went away  laura yeah remember because she used  matt she took damage and it dropped  marisha i took damage im sorry it wasnt my fault i lost concentration blame the dragon that  did /none/ 40 damage  matt so as the stream pours past you you feel your flesh burning and elements of your skin are  actually sloughing off and plummeting beneath you like a thick oatmeal  laura gross  matt you still maintain your grip on the axe through sheer force of anger and willpower  umbrasyl slows down a little bit in not doing the doubledash maneuver thats going to end  umbrasyls turn so you sent the eagles after  laura well no i wanted the eagles to pick up pike and percy  matt so the eagles swing /none/ by  marisha wait not yet stone stone  taliesin throw her the teleport stone  ashley gatestone i pull it out of my bag pass it to her  taliesin im going to hop on an eagle  laura i literally am sending the eagles as this is happening and i dash out of the tree on my  broom and go for the immovable rod just long enough to stop and grab it and keep taking off  after the dragon  matt okay so you retrieve the rod grab it and head off in that direction so /none/ we now have both of  you on eagleback heading off with you trailing behind as you cant quite travel at the same speed  as the eagles  taliesin im going to try and clear my gun while im up there too  matt okay keyleth what are you doing  marisha youve got a ride animal handling im going to drop and ill start focusing on the gatestone  taliesin so situated im just going to try and clear the gun and see if its an easy fix  matt go for it  taliesin nope guns broken /none/  laura its broken  taliesin yeah guns broken ive got another gun but big guns broken  matt yeah bad news is out all right as youre flying off youre having a hard time with the  bumpy ride as this eagle also has been near death due to being partially dissolved by the acidic  attack from the dragon before it wasnt the acid it was something else that wrecked it  laura no it was a bite or a claw  matt yeah i think it was a bite or a claw because the acid wouldve destroyed /none/ it so the  eagles heavily wounded and due to it shuddering and trying to keep up it just causes you to end up  bending a portion of the actual weapon  taliesin damn it i put it away  matt all right so you guys are keeping up youre concentrating on the stone  marisha one minute baby  matt bringing us back now grog youre recovering from this attack  travis i look down and i see my beautiful body tattoos melting away like instant oatmeal not  even like the nice apples and cinnamon kind its /none/ like the maple brown sugar that no one  laura thats my favorite kind of oatmeal  travis nobody likes that youre alone in this and it makes me so angry that i go into a rage  matt do recall you do have one point of exhaustion since your frenzied rage did wear off  beforehand  travis right yeah  matt so you go into a rage  laura oh but we have heroes feast is that good  matt it doesnt help with that no  travis all right so i go in a rage and i /none/ would like to try and continue climbing up the remainder  of the distance to umbrasyl  matt okay athletics check with advantage  travis that was a one  laura oh thats way better  travis thats much better thats a 29  matt you find your way up grabbing onto the edge of the tail and you actually pull yourself up  onto the base of the tail youre on the back of umbrasyl right now the chain is still currently  attached to its side  marisha khaleesi  travis mother of dragons do i have any /none/ more movement  matt its taken your whole turn to really get up there are you going to dislodge the bloodaxe or  leave it there  travis im going to dislodge it because it was already so weak  matt okay so go ahead and make your check to remove it its a dc 12 i think  travis thats a one yep  matt you pull on the chain but the reason it managed to hold your weight this whole ride up was  it was wedged pretty well into its armored hide and thank god it did /none/ however at this point its  proving that that is now coming back to haunt you as it is really hard to pull it from where its  stuck in the dragon thats going to be the end of your turn vax  liam first turn im going to use the dragon blade to attack and slice downward and try to wedge that  hole open a little bigger  matt go for it  liam that hits well i dont know if it hits nine plus my strength for this sword right not  dexterity  matt correct im /none/ letting this one be a finesse  liam i probably hit him before so thats a 25  matt 25 you carve an opening in the side about a foot and a half in full length there as you drag  it you hear a roaring go ahead and roll damage on that  taliesin its 1d8 plus your dex  liam yeah i know i got that written down thank you 16  matt 16 all righty  liam and then this is a game rules thing grogs within five feet of this thing and im no longer  /none/ at disadvantage or am i  matt this is less rules and more narrative you dont understand the body or where you really are  in the body of the dragon hes not threatening the creature right now if anything its  potentially threatening you this would not be a sneak attack  liam im not arguing im asking whats possible  matt no worries  liam ill use the dagger to hit am i at disadvantage with the dagger still  matt id say yes because the only reason you didnt have disadvantage with the other blade is  /none/ because it was within an existing wound and then you pulled back  liam then i miss  matt okay the other dagger you go ahead and stab again this time it hits a dense part of  muscle and does sink in but not enough to do any serious damage from the inside  liam and theres air queefing in and out of this slot  laughter  matt a little bit yes its about that wide you staying there  liam yes no im going to slide my body and try to stick head and dagger arm out /none/ of it and hang  half in and half out if possible  matt yeah go ahead and make a straight strength check  liam 13  matt 13 thats fine thankfully the dcs lower because you managed to carve the large wound in  you plant your feet against the other muscle wall that you are between and you push off and get  yourself through and in the most awkward tiny birth just above your armpits your head and arm  emerge out the side immediately a gust of wind hits your hand as you realize and look /none/ down you  are hundreds of feet above the ground bramblewood right beneath you but you are partially out of  the dragon  laura you can breathe  liam gasps for air  matt take a deep breath you take three points of crushing damage as the muscle walls around you are  still squeezing in on you in your current placement that ends your turn you at the top of  your round your snake takes acid damage only one point of acid damage how many hit points does  your poisonous snake have  sam i dont /none/ think he has very many  matt it may have less than one hit point in which case youre just going to turn right back  into scanlan  sam i think hes dead  matt lets find out it has two hit points  sam oh god oh no but wait i took damage last round too  matt that was before you transformed it was  at the top of your round  sam hey im still a snake  laughter  sam well im not going to try that any more if i drop form is that /none/ my whole round  matt no you just let it go  sam im going to drop the snake snake was a try and fail  matt it was a good idea just not a very strong snake  sam i drop the snake try to get that little bubble of air gasps and ill fucking cast  bigbys hand  matt okay so using that little pocket of air you bring your hand up you do your quick somatic  components shouting the phrase and bigbys hand appears and is currently being squished between  some of the walls /none/ of the stomach  sam can he move at all  matt yeah  sam okay i would like to fist the wound jam it find a finger and how you like that  taliesin youre fingering the wound okay  laughter  sam this wound will never heal  matt i dont yeah  laughter  sam so would it be a forceful hand  matt this would be a very forceful hand this would be the definition of bigbys forceful hand  go ahead and roll an athletics check for bigby which is strength 28 so add plus /none/ eight to the roll  sam 12  matt total of 12  sam yes  matt the finger pushes partway in and gets about halfway up to its second knuckle  laughter  matt it is just chilling right there  sam this is so embarrassing wow  laughter  matt im blushing man  liam all about phrasing  sam wow okay  matt all right thats your turn  sam i have movement right  matt you do have movement yes  sam i cant move anywhere i have climbing stuff with me can i move my /none/ arms at all  matt you can move your arms yeah  sam i would like to take out a grappling hook and grab onto the inside lining of the stomach  matt okay make a strength check  sam nope six  matt six you take it and ting swish it just slips along the very heavy mucous material lined  interior of the stomach theres a little scrape line but thats about it  sam i cant do anything its great  matt top of umbrasyls round breath weapon does not return however is going to use one /none/ of its  legendary actions and attempt to beat its wings to shake you off of it grog  laura are you raging  travis yeah  matt i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw  travis which i have advantage on 18  matt 18 you take 15 points of bludgeoning damage which is reduced by half so youre only  taking seven however you are knocked prone  travis laughing on his back  matt yes which causes you to begin tumbling off the back of the tail the wind of it thump /none/ thump  travis shit  matt the chain of returning is still attached to you however and as you go tumbling off the back  of the tail it catches you and you are now swinging towards the back of the creature of the  dragon now back where you started only the dragon is very aware of your presence but you  didnt plummet to your death  travis thats good  matt that was the end of your turn now its the top of umbrasyls turn  sam these dragons are hard to kill  matt yeah imagine /none/ that at this point now as this has gone on for a little while as you guys began  to ascend and it went upward its now partway up the mountainside you can see the forest has  gotten more sparse there are trees scattered across the top of the mountaintop  liam were close to gatshadow already  matt you can see it youre not there but its going across the forest top and its coming  towards the actual mountain base it hasnt quite ascended it completely  laura what about giant eagles with people on them  /none/ matt theyre keeping in tandem with it theyre not able to quite catch up entirely just due to  the nature of the fast dragon  liam arrow range  matt not for her unfortunately no  taliesin were not within 400 feet of it are we  matt you at this point jumping on would just be on the outside of the range if you wanted to  try youre at disadvantage on these attacks because you are on the back of a flying wounded bird  laura dont let the bird get hit by umbrasyl  taliesin fuck /none/ it taking a shot at least taking one shot to see what happens ooh yeah  natural 20  matt with disadvantage  travis do it again  taliesin 18 thatll do 27 to hit  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  taliesin oh and he still has no i lost hex  matt you lost hex yeah  liam youre doing great de rolo come on keep your head in the game  taliesin 14 points of damage  matt gun goes off you hear a whizz go by your ear as the bullet hits the /none/ side of umbrasyl  grunting the head looks back towards the rest of you now approaching at a distance  laura do not let the bird get hit you will plummet to your fucking death  taliesin im going to spend the rest of my  attack pushing the eagle down to fly at tree level  matt so at the top of umbrasyls turn as you guys are pushing forward and youre still  concentrating the dragon growls under its breath spellcasting you cant hear it youre too far away  ashley she can read lips  laura im /none/ so far away i just want to know what hes saying  matt the outer view of the dragon shimmers for a second and then vanishes from sight  liam are we visible  matt no  liam were not like wonder woman inside the jet what about my hand hanging out  matt yeah you see the dragon  sam what about grog  matt grog is dangling from nothing right now grog is kiting through the air  taliesin you have hunters mark  ashley so we can see grog  matt in theory yeah if you can /none/ keep a bead on him  travis im enlarged  matt a very heavy grog  laura is he hunters marked still  matt he would be you havent taken a lot of damage yet or at all  laura i havent taken any damage  matt then you still have hunters mark on him yeah continues upward that comes to the next  part grog youre up  travis i had one question i drank that potion of speed it hastes me for a minute how many  rounds is a minute  matt that has gone away unfortunately /none/  travis well theres nothing to do but to climb back up the chain  matt make an athletics check  travis up the chain fucking weiner snap 15  matt 15 all righty you manage to pull yourself halfway up the chain you get back to where you  were towards the base of the tail thats the extent of your round there the wind resistance  itself you can see the axe itself after you tried to tug it forward did bring it a little  loose so its position is still a little precarious  travis might /none/ as well say something cool i can do this all day im really not confident  matt all right vax  liam i would like to use my movement if i can with the blade i used to go this way and i cut a  big footlong thing i want to try to use my movement to reverse the direction of the blade and  stab inward  matt it would be part of the attack to draw it out and attack it wouldnt use your  movement it would be part of the attack to draw it out /none/ and attack with it it wouldnt use your  movement  liam my dagger hands the one thats out i want to try to maneuver the sword around and stab  inward and keep cutting bacon in here i want to attack the dragon but still from the inside with  the hand thats inside  matt okay youre in a weird position now where the blades at your side so pulling away from the  body theres very little strength to pull that way since you punched through the wound so youre  essentially holding the blade right here /none/  liam then if i did this can i just continue to saw in the same direction and do an attack  matt youd be at a disadvantage on it  liam visual i dont know what im seeing  matt you stabbed through you cut a wound holding that blade you punched through and the  thickness is about most of your bodys length so most of your body is still in the wound youve  just barely pushed through and youre still holding the blade back this way theres no real  strength to attack from this position /none/ because youre being squished  liam then im going to attack at disadvantage with the dragon blade and then im going to stab  with the dagger thats outside  matt go for it  liam dragon blade on the inside rolled a 15  matt 15  liam yeah  matt theres just not enough strength to get it though you try and pull upward and the blade  comes loose comes towards your body but doesnt actually find any additional part of the muscle to  cut through  liam dagger on the outside is 21  matt /none/ 21 just scrapes across the hide not strong enough to pierce it from the outside you do also  take one point of bludgeoning damage as the wound tenses around you once more scanlan  sam for my bonus action im going to fist the dragon again just going to jam it in there  matt roll an athletics check with plus eight  sam 20  matt 20 the hand pushes into the wound causing it to tear open and rupture part of the stomach  as it punches through temporarily leaving an open wound in the side of /none/ its stomach area bigbys  hand is partially outside the dragon now  sam great  matt it takes 11 points of damage from the wound and you currently have a little bit of light  thats visible before the wound closes  sam before the wound closes  matt the muscles retense you watch it punch through and everything gasp its the moment of  impact  sam im going to jump in the hole  matt you leap in after bigbys hand just in the wake of it slamming into the side of the muscle of  the /none/ stomach walls in that one moment youre rushing past you can feel the actual muscles  tensing behind you go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw  sam dexterity saving throw 18  matt 18 okay you manage to leap behind bigbys hand and grab onto the side of it as the hand  punches entirely out of the dragons body the wound slamming shut behind  sam oh god im outside the dragon  matt you are now outside the dragon  sam screams shit  matt holding onto bigbys hand  sam is he flying does he /none/ stay still what does he do  matt he is flying  sam he can fly  matt bigbys hand  sam not as fast as the dragon  matt bigbys hand can move up to 60 feet so no its slower than the dragon starting to drag a  little bit behind as its moving  sam god okay hand cant do anything else right  matt no that was its action thats most of your turn really at this point that was your  movement to push through after the bonus attack so you have your action ill /none/ give you your action  sam youre not going to let me cast another spell probably  matt you have an action so you could technically you look out as you punch through  you look down below you suddenly after you take a moment to look and you can see part of vax  emerging from the side of the dragon and then the whole dragon and vax vanish  sam oh shit wait i see grog  matt you do see grog dangling from the chain slowly pulling his way up towards the back  travis screaming scanlan /none/  sam im holding onto the hand  travis screaming what the fuck  matt you are now right there with bigbys hand  laughter  sam the hand cant do anything else  matt not this turn no  sam shit i just got out of the dragon i dont know whats going on i didnt even know we were  flying im just going to shoot a lightning bolt at him  matt okay  sam yeah  matt all right advantage on the dexterity saving throw whats the dc of it the dc of the  lightning /none/ bolt  sam its my spell its not through the hand cone i assume  matt nope you are clutching both hands onto the side  sam 18  matt 18 it makes the save roll damage and it takes half damage  sam 26  matt 26 all right so it takes 13 points of lightning damage blast the bolt streaks upward hitting  the sides of the wound that you just came out of it and arcs up the side of the body most of it  is absorbed from the hefty scaled hide of the black dragon /none/ but it does unhappy groan roil  with pain you hear it yelling and with a very slight shifting of light you notice the dragon is  still there and you recognize this this is an invisibility spell that ends your turn  sam i guess so  matt so the rest of you guys trying to keep up the dragons far out of range of anything you  have and its just seems to be coasting as fast as it can out of the way so you have nothing i  dont think that can really go past a /none/ 300 400 foot range so youre just keeping on that eagle  holding on you as well youre behind the others just slowly falling behind  laura how fast can my broom go  matt i think its 50 feet i can look it up again real fast its not a racing broom quidditch  broom ill find it for you  laura and my boots of haste dont do shit to a broom  matt im going to look it up right now just to let you know so we can all relax  travis its the fastest model /none/ yet i love harry potter  matt i gather that  laughter  matt i love it too broom of flying flying speed is 50 feet you cant even see it now  grogs just become this little speck in the distance all right so as thats going on are  you doing anything  taliesin im going to keep my eyes peeled on what i can see and try to keep up as best i can at  treeline like below  matt back to the top of the round the dragon umbrasyl now wings flapping even you are /none/ being  dragged behind nothing you can hear the wings beating you still have full sight of the dragon  at this point the voice growls out of its throat fine lets see how well you hold on insects  it begins to spin and do a barrel roll i need both of you as also its muscles tense to roll  strength saving throws  travis i have advantage on those  liam six  matt six  travis 26  matt 26 you get swung around the chain taking the brunt of all the weight across its back /none/  popping comes free thankfully you were in an up arc but you are now arcing in the air you  also get ejected from the wound from the muscles tensing behind it almost squeezes you out before  you can even get a grapple on the dragon vanishes from sight and youre now falling backwards  liam id like take a chance to say here that when i went into this dragon i was lost and a  wanderer as i am shat out its side i come forth a paladin of the raven queen i have multiclassed  /none/ and leveled up and the last thing im thinking as i shoot out this hole in its side is if you have  any wings to lend me now is the time  matt okay as you emerge from the body of umbrasyl there is a streak of shadow that  scatters into a burst of darkened raven feathers that fill the air around you you still plummet  but as a nature of your prayer that brief moment of understanding it appears there is some  reaction thatll be that element there  marisha where am i in my /none/ minute  matt oh youre like 20 seconds in 30 seconds in  ashley are they all falling  matt you guys now watch as suddenly grog and vax just rush of air vax appears out of nowhere  and is falling scanlans being held aloft by a distant bigbys hand and grog is arcing in  the air at that point now grog vax what are you doing as youre falling backward  travis i take out a case of fancy wine and  laughter  travis i pull out a fancy robe of which there are two and /none/ pull it out im going to drop the  bloodaxe im going to grab both ends of the fancy robe and just make the shittiest parachute of all time  matt air puffs  travis there aint much else to do  marisha shitty gi joes  matt yeah its like 25 cent quality above you grog as you squeeze your eyes and hold on  plummeting down towards the bramblewood vax  liam hey im a brand new paladin lay on hands which is going to do fuck all for me but is that  a bonus action  /dung/ matt i believe its an action  liam an action okay im going to cast lay on hands on myself and im going throw my poison  dagger at the dragon as i fall thats a 23  matt 23 does hit  liam that is ten points of damage with poison on it its a dc of 15 for poison im sure it makes it  matt yeah it makes it it wouldve had to roll a one to not make it unfortunately  travis could i add one bonus thing at the end of mine  matt sure /none/  travis can i see scanlan and bigbys hand at all or is the world just a clusterfuck  matt make a perception check just glancing around you  travis four  matt four no you see earth beneath you sky above mountain to your left and the inevitable  plummet coming at you  liam im thinking about my mother as i fall backward through space  sam distance between me and them  matt vax is about 20 feet from you grogs about 60 70 feet from you  sam whats the range of shit  taliesin 50 /none/ feet  travis remember were going to be  going the same direction  marisha theyre both falling yeah vax will hit the ground first  sam vax will  travis im higher  matt the dragons moved ahead to this point now since you guys have fallen off  sam is anyone higher than me  matt grog is vax is a little bit below you  sam and hes not flying or anything is he  matt hes trying hes holding a scrap piece of fabric thats just rustling fabric  travis ive seen percy make shit i /none/ can do it too blows puffs of air  taliesin youre doing very well youre doing very well  sam wow this didnt go well  marisha im hoping you can hold on for a minute  sam okay yeah im going to drop bigbys 60 feet is not plummeting speed i cant catch up to  them as they fall  matt right now you could catch up to one of them  sam all right because grog is over me right  matt yeah grog is in an arc so you would have to meet him as he /none/ fell  sam ill try to catch him then  matt okay so you clutch onto bigbys hand and move as he plummets  sam shit wait wait  matt what are you doing what are you doing scanlan  sam shit vax is below me though  liam he said you can get to one of them so its just a sophies choice  sam its a sophies choice  marisha but whos on the lowest hit points  sam yeah i would go for grog if hes above me with the hand  matt okay the hand comes /none/ forward sends out this cupping motion the fingers below you eyes  closed clenching tight impact all of a sudden the wind stops and its like youre being  held by your mother again a memory you havent recalled since you were a child you open your  eyes slowly and youre still above the ground holy shit but theres a giant purple hand around  you and a very freaked out scanlan clutching the outside  travis look what you did  sam hi friend shit weve got to go to vax ill start moving us slowly down i /none/ guess  matt that was the turn to even get to him and catch him  sam then fuck  matt you still have an action if you have anything  sam i cant see the dragon anymore right  matt no you have a vague idea of where it might be  marisha do you still have polymorph  sam yeah concentration  marisha fuck  sam yep i mean i can make grog deaf so he wont hear us die  laughter  matt thats useful  taliesin that seems like a really good use  sam i /none/ got grog fuck okay im going to drop bigbys hand and polymorph grog into an eagle  matt okay so as you look over at scanlan with a big look of relief and thank you he gives you a  cursory look as the hand vanishes  travis what what screams  sam holding on to him  matt he grabs you real fast and suddenly you have feathers what the shit and strangely you  become smarter as giant eagles have an intelligence of eight  liam quick come up with a plan  travis its a new day /none/ baby  sam his brain is just geometry  matt its a beautiful mind moment in the middle of the sky suddenly you understand the instinct  hits you and whoosh you have wings you feel scanlans tiny hands grasping the back of your neck  sam and i just yell at him dive motherfucker dive  travis caw  matt all right you guys start seeing this happen in the distance and a little sparkle of hope hits  you whatever it may be coming back around to the top umbrasyl is taking a double dash motion hes past /none/  liam he got away  matt grog its your turn  travis can i see that flurry of black feathers streaking downwards of this guy  matt you do and it is a perpetual flurry theyre coming out of nowhere it is this long  visual line of black feathers that are being tossed from beneath vaxs flapping cape  travis were going full point break terminal velocity straight down towards vax  sam i hope i can hold on theres nothing to grab onto is there  matt theres just heavy feathers and digging in  sam luckily /none/ i have a grappling hook dink dink dink  travis maybe in my dive position i could squeeze your legs with my wings how about that  laura youre really smart you would think to do that  travis i would  ashley yeah you would  travis i would also think what idiot was just flying behind the back of this dragon on a chain  what a fool  matt so as you go into a full dive thats 80 speed thats 160 feet whoosh you manage to  just crest underneath the plummeting vax the trail of /none/ black feathers trailed by a long line of  brown feathers being plucked out from scanlan feverishly trying to grab onto your back for some  sort of purchase pain you deal with pain all the time it doesnt dissolve your focus vax i need  you to go ahead and attempt to grab onto the eagle as it swoops beneath you go ahead and make a  single strength saving throw  liam no wait luck i have one last luck  matt this is the time to use it  laura oh my god  liam 21  /none/ matt as the eagle swoops underneath you you reach out you dont even see it youre looking  up into the sky as you plummet the trail of feathers going past as you concentrate on the  acceptance youve made to the raven queen and the understanding that perhaps if there is a chance  to survive let it be through this leap of faith youve taken in the direction of an entity that  youve been so fearful of and scoffed at since she came to you in your dreams a moment you see the  feathers begin to /none/ trail off and subside from beneath your cloak and a voice whispers in your  ear and says left without thinking your hand reaches out without even seeing and you impact  grab the edge of scanlans cloak  sam oh no  matt as youre dragged behind you choking from behind  sam its worth it its worth it  matt you can barely breathe as the eagle swoops up you can feel the heartbeat the blood flowing  in the back of your head your ears hot heartbeat as you slowly reach over and grab the  back /none/ of the eagle is this keyleth you dont know all you know is scanlan swooped in and in  this moment of need seemingly a prayer was answered so what are you guys doing  laura and youre itty bitty still  liam i prefer ravensized  matt yeah hes tiny thats the only reason im not having him tear you off the back of the eagle  because of the size  travis unless i hear otherwise im making a controlled descent towards the ground  matt okay you guys see this in the distance as now the eagle /none/ captures the falling vax and then  begins to head down towards the base of the mountain where the bramblewood meets  laura i guess we head down that direction  ashley yeah make the eagle follow  matt okay you guys make your way downward towards the bottom keyleth you finish your  concentration on the stone whoosh suddenly you step through being pushed through a tunnel of  blue light and energy and for a moment all you see before you is vaxs face his tiny little  ravensized face  marisha so cute  matt whoosh as /none/ you guys watch keyleth apparate right in front of vax and go speeding past you  as shes now plummeting from the air having summoned to your side  marisha im technically an earth elemental still  matt youre still earth elemental so yeah you see keyleth as a giant boulder that appears at the  side you have to dodge out of the way whoosh as this giant rock being out of the corner of your  eye appears before you however she sinks straight past you youre flying as low as you  can youre going terminal velocity /none/ and there is this rumble rock entity plummeting at the same rate  taliesin a meteor  marisha you know it was a good idea when he was still in the dragon  matt yeah i know it was  liam singing i came in like a wrecking ball  matt at about 200 feet up you continue to plummet  marisha 200 feet thats all right  matt all right youre not doing anything else youre going to take the fall  marisha well whats below me  matt the very edge of the bramblewood and the base of /none/ the mountain youre not quite sure where  youll land you see treetops and rocks  taliesin whats the worst thats going to happen  marisha i would hit zero hit points as an earth elemental and go back to keyleth  matt and then the rest of the damage would carry over  marisha right but 200 feet thats survivable  matt thats 20d6  sam youll be fine whats that 60 points  marisha yeah its roughly 60 points and ive got 67 left as this earth elemental  matt all right so youre going to take it /none/  marisha hang on wait wait wait if im going to do this im going to do it right im going to  ball up like a cannonball and light up my hands that i keep forgetting because i didnt know i  could do them in elemental form by the way thought it was only beast form im going to light  myself on fire and go meteor  matt all right you guys watch as the earth elemental curls up forms this streak of flame and  smoke behind and now a plummeting keyleth meteor goes slamming into /none/ the base of the mountain just  past you as you pull up from impacting at terminal velocity  marisha i was trying to leave an impression no pun intended  matt you suffer 76 points of bludgeoning damage upon impact  sam of jorel damage  laughter  matt boom this giant crater is left around your form as now there is this somewhat smokeswirled  keyleth sprawled out in the center of this  marisha i drop and i stand up keyleth in the middle of a giant crater  matt the rest of you all eventually catch /none/ up the eagleback carriers you on broomback finding  your party bruised hurt but ultimately survived this moment of the encounter as youve all had  this moment to yourself vex you hear a noise to your left coming from the exterior of the  bramblewood  laura can i see what it is  matt you glance off to the side and you can see emerging slowly from the forest a single  humanoid standing before you  sam is he single  matt no you see slowly coming forward a woman an older woman an older goliath woman /none/ missing  one eye and missing her forearm her left arm right at the elbow the right arm clutches a very  tall quarterstaff that is being used as a walking stick as she wanders up you can see dirt smeared  in her face darker dreadlocks pulled tight against the back of the head that dangle past the  shoulders tattoos similar to the ones that adorn grog across the face and shoulders she slowly  walks towards the party lets go ahead and bring our guest for the evening out you can go around  the other way /none/ lets welcome chris perkins  liam welcome chris welcome  taliesin is he coming to this side  matt right to the edge next to you keyleth  sam do you know how to play this game  chris keyleth meteor what  marisha yeah thats me  matt as she steps up and emerges from the forest everyone turns and sees the worry on vexs face  laura laughs vax pours a drink  liam it was very frightening  laura halt who are you  chris my name is shale  laura whats your business here  chris /none/ i was following a scouting party out to the mountain but these old bones dont take me as far  as fast as they used to  travis do i recognize shale  matt you do actually not very well shale has been around longer than you have as part of the  herd but is mostly considered past her prime as a warrior since she lost her arm was set to the  side and a lot of the herd seems to not value their elders when they become less powerful in  battle but even still she carries /none/ a bit of spit and vinegar to her but its been a while since  youve seen her and to see her surviving out here both curious and honorable  travis shale  sam sorry youre still an eagle  matt caw  travis caw  sam grog do you want to say something  chris i will brandish my quarterstaff my runecovered quarterstaff and try to hold this  big creature at bay  matt shales holding her staff out  chris stand down bird  liam i love you let me love you  sam all right all /none/ right ill drop the form ill drop the form  travis thank you god shale  chris grog is that you  travis yeah its me i know you cant tell  chris youre kind of a blur whats on your face  travis its a beard  chris youve gotten big  travis yeah lots of lifting lots of running getting strong  chris last time i saw you you were the runt of the goatball team  travis oh  laura you were a runt grog  travis no when i was born she means when i was /none/ born  laura was he rather small  chris he was puny  travis puny compared to mountains and stuff  ashley whats goatball  chris its a game you play you stand on pillars of rock and you hurl balls at each other  laura made of goats  chris made of goatskins skins my dear  marisha sounds kind of fun  chris the object of the game is to knock the other opponents off their pillars  liam thats more civilized than what we were imagining  travis its a lot of fun actually  laura shale /none/ what were you doing out here with a scouting party it seems  chris we were spying on the dragon damnable beast  laura did you succeed  chris no the scouting team did not fare well  marisha are any of them still alive  chris no theyre all dead  sam how did you survive  chris i was slow and stupid i shouldnt have gone at all i couldnt keep up with them by the  time i got to them they were corpses  sam you sound like an excellent addition to our team then  /none/ chris she says i would have killed the dragon as soon as it came upon us when we first arrived  in westruun but that damn kevdak formed an alliance with the beast  laura wait you think you can kill a dragon  ashley wait what did you just say oh  sam we knew that  ashley yes realized it as i was saying it  chris that is how i wanted to die fighting the dragon  marisha its funny we almost just died fighting the dragon how ironic  travis we put a good hurting on /none/ it yeah do you i mean not like im questioning what can  you do because i dont think its very much  marisha im actually great im just in a smoldering meteor and look like a badass  matt which caught your attention the large crashing boom  chris that was it  liam i yank on vexs hand from down below and say pick me up put me on your shoulder  laura whats the matter can you not see anything down there i pop trinket out and put vax on top  of him dont you feel /none/ so tall now  liam i am tall  marisha how much longer is he going to be tiny  matt how long does the potion last  liam i rolled a three so thats three hours  matt yeah three hours  travis sweet  liam we have to decide what to do hes gone back to his hole hes going to rest hes going to heal  marisha i just have such a hard time taking you seriously right now im so sorry  travis so you had to have been a part of this party for a /none/ reason whats in your bag of tricks  what can you do  chris i smash things with my stick  travis with your stick does magic come out of your stick  chris it is a magical staff  travis oh well thats good  sam yeah we could use more of those  travis is it a magical staff of dragon killing  chris it will be if we get on with it  travis i like that  liam i like her too  marisha so shale did you and your scouting party find out any additional /dung/ information that  might be handy  laura maybe how to get into the lair without it knowing  marisha what she said  chris i know nothing of use  laura thats wonderful  liam you never made it up to the cave entrance did you  chris i made it up to the dead ones thats as far as i got  laura how far were the dead ones  chris a ways  marisha all right  sam i hate to tell you this but kevdak is gone  chris no great loss  sam your whole /none/ herd may have perished fighting this same dragon  liam not all of them  marisha a lot of them  travis but it will all be worth it if we can remove the head of this shitty black dragon  chris i agree  laura plus zanror is still alive as is his wife i think  sam maybe  marisha we hope  taliesin possibly  travis so how far would you think that we are from his lair  chris ill just crane my neck up the mountain  matt its a sizable climb gatshadow while this /dung/ portion is the south part of the cliffkeep  mountains which get higher the further north you go this mountain is called gatshadow because it  is dark and ominous and stands out amongst the rest of the mountains while the other ones crest  at about maybe 4000 feet up this ones nearly a mile a little over a mile high  laura well we can obviously fly  matt there are sparse trees most of them dead or dried out towards the top but other than that the  vegetation is pretty sparse  travis look im a /none/ little jacked up i think those two are a little jacked up  marisha i could use a short rest  travis its fair to assume that he will do the same thing yeah  sam yeah  travis go brush his teeth have a deuce all that stuff  marisha were trying to catch the dragon while hes still debilitated right  liam the longer we wait the harder it will be  ashley what if i just heal everybody and we keep on  sam yeah thats great  ashley i dont want to lose the damage thats /none/ on him  sam yeah heal us and lets keep going quickly how long has it been a minute two minutes  matt since you guys landed here its probably been about two three minutes  sam weve got to move  travis can we travel a mile up a mountain quickly  sam we have eagles  matt even at your fastest pace eagle speed  liam the broom and the two eagles at this point  matt the broom is slower than the eagles eagle speed youre looking at about im estimating  somewhere between ten to 20 /none/ minutes  liam thats enough for a short rest for it hes not going to go back to full strength but hes  going to go back up a bit  laura would we know that  marisha we dont know what he has access to  matt you would know being as dragons are your favored enemy and you have information on that  generally they dont they themselves can recover over time and if given a full day or so  they can largely recover from the wounds they have sustained almost entirely especially a dragon as  /none/ powerful as an ancient you would know that because they understand and fear their demise or  at least are arrogant enough to think its not possible they will have certain reserves to try  and help them recover if they ever find themselves in a dire circumstance occasionally depending on  the intelligence of the dragon and what resources it has at its disposal  marisha reserves what do you mean  laura healing stuff  matt some semblance of healing magic items they may have acquired that can help the longer you  wait the more it can /none/ recover is essentially what it comes down to  liam we need to go now we need to go  sam should we mist form it there can we do that  laura that takes too long to think about  marisha i can get us there via trees  sam but youd need to know a tree thats there  marisha i need to know a tree thats there i could scry look for the closest tree teleport us  there but by the time im getting there im exhausted  liam are you able to see a tree /none/ from a great distance  marisha if i scry  liam not even by eyesight  marisha i mean i guess i can look around and take a guess  ashley im going to cast mass cure wounds on everybody  matt all right go ahead and do that and shale you feel nice and warm at full health as the mass  cure wounds tickles you  laura is your arm back  matt unfortunately no if only  sam the temporary hit points never go back up right  matt correct no they were just for that little /none/ bit of damage  chris lost it in an avalanche i did  sam today  chris no turd  matt the scrying will take you about ten minutes or so  laura are we going to scry it or are we just going to go how long would it take if we just  flew up  20 minutes  matt thats if you were all on eagleback which you dont you have eight people and you  currently have two summoned eagles  liam speed of the slowest  matt yeah the speed of the slowest here youre /none/ looking at walking up the mountain  marisha yeah so i can teleport us closer and then walk or we can take a very short rest so i  can get my beast shaping back and then could fly a few more of us its a gamble  chris you take your rest love ill start up the mountain  matt shale walks away and starts hiking up the rocks at the very base of gatshadow  travis can i just say that we agree that the reason we didnt do what zanror wanted and go to  the lair /none/ is because its a fucking death trap  sam yes but the dragon is injured now  travis but hes going to heal up by the time we get there  sam not all the way  travis pretty good  liam its still the best chance we have we have to kill it now  travis in its lair  chris its your destiny to fight the dragon grog  marisha wait what what was that shale is that true  chris no its not true  laughter  ashley everybody is healed 27  chris its just a /none/ thing old women say  marisha just let him believe it  liam kiki may i have my sorry higher voice may i have my cloak back  marisha oh yeah sure  liam thank you flump whoosh  matt to attune to it will take you a short rest  marisha so are we resting  matt thats up to you guys  liam i dont know but im still putting it on  travis when i turned into the eagle what happened to the bloodaxe and chain  matt actually you check and the equipment that you have /none/ attuned to you and attached go into the  form with you so at this moment you realize oh the axe you look behind you and its just been  dragging behind you in the dirt carving this path in the rocks and rubble  travis yeah thats nifty  matt like a kid with a deflated balloon youre just dragging behind you  laura can i well i cant sense anything about it with hunters mark i just know where he is  matt you know where it is  laura and hes up in his lair  matt /none/ he is up at the top of gatshadow somewhere in that mountain  laura moving around or is he chilling  matt at the moment seems chilling  sam lets go  matt short rest or not what are you guys doing  marisha how long would the hike up the mountain be an hour  matt its about a mile up youre looking at the better part of a day  sam oh a mile up  matt yeah  laura unless we fly  taliesin what if we take shifts with the eagles  matt take shifts with /none/ the eagles back and forth  taliesin eagles fly a group up fly down pick up another group and bring them  matt probably about an hour  taliesin but thats an hour with a short rest for everybody as well  matt if youre going to do it that way yeah  liam half could rest at the top while the eagles fly back and the ones at the bottom could rest  taliesin so theres a short rest  liam shifts of resting yeah  matt youre still looking at about an hour and a half at that /none/ point with people moving there and  back and getting enough rest you cant short rest on the trip and the short rest is about an hour  half an hour  liam eagles drop off they rest while the eagles return and the people at the bottom rest while  the eagles are making the trip no  matt right but you still have to have the eagles that went to the bottom to pick up the second team  to get there so youre still looking at about an hour and a half to two hours  laura /none/ i could also use another spell and summon a couple more eagles  sam sure  laura i could summon two more eagles  liam thats worth it  laura and that could get how many of us up  liam all of us up at the same time  sam but one is just for grog right  laura but two more eagles would get all of us up  matt its a concentration spell you can only have one of it up at a time  laura it is  matt yeah and it only lasts for an /none/ hour and youve already been at this for probably about  ten 15 minutes  laura so theyre about to go away  matt you have about another 40 minutes of the eagles  marisha so we couldnt do round trips anyway theyd dissipate  matt youd just have to recast it  marisha well yeah  sam that seems like our fastest option whats the other option a short rest and then we bamf  marisha we rest and then go if we rest for 30 minutes and then i switch and then we have the  eagles then /none/ we can get up in another 30 minutes and then its an hour theoretically short  resting is our shortest  matt you said you have transport via plants right  marisha i do  matt if you wanted to scry up that mountain and look at one of the trees at the top you could do  that that would be technically the fastest way  marisha but then wed still have to hike how long would the hike be  matt it depends on how close the nearest tree to the cavern would be  sam lets do /none/ that  marisha im tapping myself i can do it but im tapping myself out im burning literally all my  top level spells and i have no beast shapes left but i can do it its what we think is most  important  laura what if we use the eagles send them up once theyre used up theyre gone at the top and  then ill just summon two more and send everybody else up once the people make it up the top that  way it takes less time a couple people hop on the eagles right /none/ now because we only have a little  bit of time left  marisha can i rest can i rest while the first round goes  matt sure  travis were fighting a dragon in its lair in the worst place we could possibly fight it  sam weve also dealt so much damage to it  matt umbrasyl was looking pretty rough  sam i fisted through it  taliesin he said looking pretty rough  travis thats because hes a liar and a bringer of death and he is smiling at you while he does it  taliesin /none/ i know  sam what are we going to do today with chris perkins talk or go fucking kill a dragon  taliesin would you like a tour of whitestone its really lovely this time of year  chris im judging you  liam grog shes right it is your destiny  travis in your tiny voice  liam what are you laughing at  laura everybody hop on an eagle  ashley i hop on an eagle  taliesin hopping on an eagle  sam well no half of the people hop on an eagle  laura two of /none/ the halflings two of the gnomes can get on  ashley scanlan  sam im in back  ashley yes  liam im sort of a halfling can i get on too  matt at your size the three of you would probably be able to take one eagle because you  are tiny  sam oh thats right hes a little one  laura all right you guys go  liam see you in a bit sis bye keek  matt so well say for the purposes of this itll take an additional cast of your spell so  /none/ mark off a second casting of conjure woodland beings however that brings what level is that  laura that is level oh good level three  matt conjure woodland beings  laura so ive got two level threes left with my pearl of power  matt conjure woodland beings is a 4thlevel spell laura  laura i have conjure animals not woodland beings  matt animals there we go sorry so yeah that is 3rdlevel so yeah mark off your second casting  there you guys manage to make a short rest between the journeys making your way up towards /dung/  the dark blackened rock peak of gatshadow were going to take a short break here for restroom  well be back here in a few minutes in the meantime we have an awesome video from backblaze  to show you guys  ashley yay  taliesin its really cute  marisha its for you guys  matt well be back here in a few minutes guys stay tuned for apparently the attack on umbrasyls  lair see you in a minute  break  matt welcome back everyone weve had a little break here a quick announcement for you /none/ guys the  rebroadcast tonight will be delayed for about 30 minutes as we have to shoot something directly  after this so we can all go home so if you guys are in chat after and folks are showing up going  wheres the rebroadcast just let them know itll be around about a 2030 minute break  between we appreciate you guys carrying that thread over to them when they arrive so weve had a  break if you wanted to use any of your hit dice to heal up during the short rest nows the time  /none/ to do it youve reattuned to the dragon slayer longsword and just so you guys know both grog  and vax leveled up to 14 as well vax took a level of paladin during the short rest grog also took  his 14th level as a barbarian as a berserker a lot of you know what that means  sam i dont know what that means  liam well find out id like to reattune to the cloak of displacement and the boots of  haste are they spent for the day for anybody if i were to wear them /none/ could i get the juice or no  theyre done  laura theyre too big for you teeny  liam they would shrink to me im going to reattune my keen dagger then for the moment so  its deathwalkers ward keen dagger cloak three items  matt okay ill let it happen usually you attune one item in a short rest  liam oh okay no i can do one  matt i think its fine for this you get attuned as you walk up the rest of the way its fine  travis ive rolled all nine of /none/ my hit dice  matt so youre out of hit dice  travis yes  matt all right everyone else good ready to jump back in  taliesin nope  matt laughs  sam does anyone need more healing are we okay  marisha yeah were good  laura and because i conjured woodland animals i lost my hunters mark  matt yes you did but you know loosely where it was  sam all right lets hurry  matt as you guys slowly make your way up towards the peak of gatshadow you all come to rest maybe  /dung/ from what best you can tell is the entrance cavern that umbrasyl currently calls its home  across this blackened dark craggy surface you see clumps of dead petrified trees leafless  gnarled and devoid of any life there are signs of melted stone soot long ago there may have been  a fire that claimed the top of this mountain and set its visual presentation that got its name  however this is your moment should you wish to make your way towards your conflict with umbrasyl  how do you wish to prepare  laura i want to /none/ sleep for a day  marisha yeah i want to rock back and forth in a corner  liam id like to go stealth and id like to see is there one clear main entrance to this place  matt there is a cavern opening  liam yes  matt there are a few small little inlets into the mountain at certain points but the path that you  guys land on that ends youre going to have to climb around the mountain to get to the entrance  of this there is no walkup path actually just an opening /none/ on the side of the mountain  liam so were further down still were not near the entrance  matt youre about 400 to 500 feet away from the entrance  laura im going to cast pass without a trace on all of us  matt you stealth ahead and look a little bit and you notice the path comes to an end you probably  have about a hundred feet that you have to scale the side of mountain to get to the entrance  liam from where i am i can tell that we need to climb around /none/ it if i look very hard do i see any  little holes or cracks or anything above  matt you see one other small entrance about maybe 60 feet below it a little bit to the left  liam all right  sam pretty cool sound effects  chris its freaking me out  laura is that your music  matt that is not my music thats the atmosphere  taliesin shale shale the scouting party where did you find the bodies where were they left  matt which actually you this was probably a couple hundred feet back /none/ they made it near the  peak however they were spotted upon the approach and you heard the battle the very short  battle that ensued heard the screams of them far from your eyesight  chris i will have pointed them out then  matt yeah  liam so thats why i cast pass without a trace on us  liam how far above our position is that smaller entrance  noise of hissing gas  matt its all atmosphere guys i paid them to do it i know all right towards where the actual  walkable portion of /none/ this mountain cliff ends you have about 40 feet of scaleable wall at an upward  angle before you can reach that small little inlet that you saw there an additional 60 feet  beyond that is the larger entrance where you saw the best you can tell umbrasyl retreat towards  or exit before when you were watching him emerge from the mountain thats it  liam what do you think do you think i should climb in that little hole  laura do you want say that again  liam theres a main entrance above but theres also /none/ a smaller little gap lower down he cannot  fit in there  marisha i can try and scry inside the cavern  laura see if its something that would be worth  marisha get a battle perspective  laura yeah  marisha all right you have to give me a few minutes is everyone all right with that  laura can i use my ranger skills to try to camouflage us into the side of the mountain to  make us even more nonseeable  matt yeah totally so well say for the purposes of that anyone at this /none/ point whod like  to make a stealth check to go ahead and keep yourselves hidden from any onlooking parties  marisha natural 20  laura add ten  liam natural 20  marisha hey  matt add ten for pass without a trace  sam 17  taliesin 24  chris 22  travis 16  ashley 29  all whoa  ashley what  laughter  liam why i do declare  ashley well i do declare im invisible  matt the armored cleric cannot be seen  laughter  laura 32  matt with vexs help you /none/ guys manage to take bits of the mud soot and the burnt remnants of the once  lush forest that dotted this mountainside and darken your exteriors to help obscure the vision  of anything that wished to pry along with the magic drawing the shadows to your forms youre  pretty confident that most of you would be fairly difficult to be spotted by most creatures  liam i would just like to point out that my complete total is 45  ashley of stealthing  laura thank you thank you for pointing that out  liam yes its /none/ mostly for your benefit  laura i appreciate it  matt thats ridiculous  ashley and laura how  liam natural 20 plus my 15 benefit plus pass without a trace poof vanishing sound  matt youve stealthed through time people who had seen you previously in your past have no  recollection of ever actually seeing you  laughter  liam marty mcflys holding a photograph  matt exactly all right so whats up now  marisha i take a little of the soot and i give myself some druid battle makeup  matt there you go just smear /none/ it  laura yeah did you scry yet  marisha im about to  laura okay i do the same thing i soot my face up too lets all make battle paint while shes  scrying  taliesin absolutely not  laughter  marisha pretentious asshole  ashley i want to do a hand  laughter  laura i get soot on my finger and walk up to percy and just put a line from his forehead down  his face  taliesin i feel violated but thank you  chris ill ask grog if he wants any soot on /none/ his face ill walk over  travis ill put soot on your face if you come near me with that wicked wicked staff of yours  chris this is not wicked its just a staff it doesnt even have a name  travis what how could you have a staff and not give it a name  chris only men name their things  laughter  marisha yeah my staff doesnt have a name its so true  chris you know if you kill this dragon youll be the greatest goliath thats ever lived  travis no  chris yes /none/  travis really  chris no one else has killed a dragon of this size not among us not among the herd  ashley grog  travis pike killed a dragon  chris did you now  ashley well we all did but it wasnt this big  laura it was pretty small  ashley it was pretty it was a lot bigger than me  chris im sure that experience will come in handy  sam all right lets do this  marisha all right i scry i focus really hard on the dragon  matt okay on umbrasyl /none/  marisha yeah  sam do you need any of his stomach bile to help you scry  marisha sure can i have some of the i scrape a little stomach bile  sam does that help does that help  matt well here let me pull up the actual specifics for scrying here  chris this is going to go well i can feel it  marisha wait hes going to sense what i can scry cant he maybe i can just try and scry  inside the lair  matt it largely depends  sam what do you /none/ want to do  marisha i mean he knows were coming yeah  laura can you scry that little cavern to see where it leads to can you scry your mind up the cavern  marisha yeah actually can i do that like its a camera drone  matt its more like picking a location as opposed to an actual  marisha sure i want to try and focus on umbrasyls whereabouts but i want to see if i  can get a nice birdseye view of inside the cavern  matt okay you are familiar with the target as /dung/ youve done battles that does adjust the saving  throw for the scry so without further ado whats the dc of your spells currently  marisha 19  matt 19 hmm as your eyes close your vision projects itself beyond your form beyond the  craggy landscape of gatshadow out beyond the mountain pass that ends abruptly beyond the  cavern entrance you are pulled within the darkness suddenly you find a little bit of light  scatters across the damp stonework of the inside of this cavern you see stalagmites you see pools  of murky greenishbrackish liquid ever /none/ so gently disturbed by the wind that curls in and out of  this cavern you see towards the back an elevated platform next to another pool where a large  outcropping of stone that has just slowly pulled itself out of the rock nearly touching the very  height of this cavern you dont see anything in there all you hear is low breathing sound  sam hes asleep  chris loudly what do you see  marisha ah  laughter  marisha well nothing now thats it thats all i see  matt thats all you see  /dung/ laura did you see umbrasyl  marisha no but i heard him he sounds very rough or possibly sleeping i dont know there  was a lot of heavy breathing very deep not you know shallow breathing not impassioned  breathing scanlan  laura could he still be invisible  marisha he could i guess still be invisible also the cave was covered in acid pools  and dark and dingy and everything else we would expect  laura yeah  marisha i know  travis lets do it  sam okay were going in the small hole or the /none/ big hole  marisha i dont think he caught my presence i dont think hes necessarily expecting us we can  have the element of surprise here  liam let me check out that hole on top you guys can watch me do it  laura go in the little hole then  liam im little now its a big hole its quite big actually  laura its roomy  liam id like to climb up to it  matt okay go ahead  liam spidersense tingling the whole time  matt all right so you manage to find bits /none/ of rock and pull yourself across the way its not  too long a distance but enough to the point where i need you to go ahead and make a basic strength check  liam 14  matt 14 okay its hard and you feel part of your muscles build up lactic acid from the  exertion from the previous round with umbrasyl and you not being necessarily the strongest  individual of the troupe but you do manage to scurry your way up to the edge of this small  opening in the mountainside getting inside you get a /none/ look this hole continues for about 15 feet  into the mountain before it ends abruptly the only other thing you notice is there are  currently four longdead skeleton corpses within this hole perhaps some sort of mountainclimbing  expedition or travelers that found their way there and couldnt escape there are remnants of  a small camp perhaps a small fire that is long icedover through winters past a layer of dust  sits on everything and other than the occasional gust of wind that finds its way in here largely  undisturbed for a long period of /none/ time  liam i want to look through the remains  matt okay you rummage through the remains you find roughly 85 gold pieces amongst their corpses  and spare change in silver and copper  liam i dont take that  matt copper the pennies of dd poor things copper dragons everywhere are just so  disappointed you do find an oil lantern climbing gear for four people some longspoiled rations  and you find a very moldy diary  liam i take out the flametongue dagger and give myself some light  matt as youre scanning through most /none/ of the pages that are still intact and not completely molded  over or destroyed it appears to be a journal that contains writings of what was an expedition to  reach the peak of gatshadow because there was some sort of movement some sort of activity up  there that nobody could really discern the rumors speak of some sort of creature that would stalk out in  the night and steal mountain goats belches pardon me goats steal mountain goats steal or find and  kill anybody who lived in there used to be a smaller village that /none/ lived north on the  mountainscape that is now abandoned because of this creature the folklore of the time said  supposedly lived at the top of the mountain it speaks of the entrance the place that umbrasyl now calls  the lair and this leads you to believe that this is a fresh lair umbrasyl did not appear to always  live within gatshadow but is only currently making it its lair at the moment  liam is this a dead end does it look like it goes further in  matt make a perception check  liam by /dung/ the light of my dagger  matt actually this would be investigation  liam investigation all right 20 no wait yeah 20  matt 20 feeling along the walls you find elements of the rocks that are easier to break off  than others but this is predominantly the end of this cavern  liam its a cave okay i tell my sister its a dead end its nothing coming  matt so vax finds his way back to the group  sam its a dead end jesus this aint going to be good shale would you like to lead /none/ the way  chris yes now i may not survive this im quite old and i can only see about 30 feet ahead of me  laura well then maybe she doesnt lead the way  laughter  liam my sister and i should lead the way you stick to grog will you grandma  chris i whack him  laughter  matt whack sound  liam wait i dont get to dodge  matt no because unexpected she is swift and she is strong for being onearmed and of her age  the sting hits the side of your /none/ shoulder before you have a moment to really understand and your  diminutive form is thrown about three or four feet back before you catch yourself  travis laughter  liam i skitter off ahead of the group  marisha i cast protection from acid on grog again  chris now if i dont survive loves i do have some magic on me so this staff has runes you  can scratch them off and magical things will appear and this horn if you blow it real loud  it will let out a tremendous thunder that could bring down /dung/ the entire cave  sam i dont think you should be planning for your own death  laura ill take the horn  chris it might explode  sam it might explode  chris its a little unstable  laura scanlan you should take the horn  sam shes not dead yet  laura im saying when she dies if she dies  sam were not going to divvy up her stuff thats bad luck  liam shes bequeathing it to you in her will  chris and this pendant here which looks like a dragon tooth its a dragon /none/ tooth and if you  wear it it will close your wounds  laura could i insight check her i feel like shes lying through her teeth  laughter  matt make an insight check  sam maybe we should just kill her now and take the stuff  laura natural 20  matt really so chris  chris im being super sincere  laura oh i really want all those things  chris she honestly believes  laughter  marisha shale you seem almost like youre  chris my hide armor aint worth shit  marisha as i was /none/ saying you seem like youre almost expecting to die or youre looking forward  to it  chris well im very old and if i could die fighting a dragon well theres no better way to  go if i dont die great wonderful  marisha all right just checking that we wouldnt disappoint you if you dont die  travis wait just to be clear if we kill the dragon are you going to say you killed the dragon  or would you say i killed the dragon whos going to be the greatest goliath  chris why you /none/ of course  travis yeah  chris im past my prime  travis well shake on it  chris i will shake on it  matt which is easy because you put out the proper hand for the one arm she has  chris you want to mess with her put out your other hand  laughter  marisha shale what type of magic do you wield exactly  chris i wield this staff  marisha okay very clear  taliesin this is going to be great im on board and committed to this this is very exciting  sam /none/ thank you shale lets try to live  marisha so remember acid pools everywhere do we have any type of cohesive plan or just  sam were just going to go in  taliesin just be very quiet  liam im already looking for traps looking for danger  matt so youre coming up to the entrance  liam im not going to go in the entrance but im going to try to climb up and peer over the edge  and look as carefully as i can  matt go ahead and make another strength check  liam 17 /none/  matt you manage to climb your way up to the larger mouth of the cavern its about 40 feet  across at the very front of it and about 50 feet up its this large  liam 40 feet 50 feet  matt yeah and the rest of you guys are you pursuing  sam im going to come  matt rest of you climbing along the mountain as well  sam wait is that the way in  travis is there anything you can do to make the dragon visible with his invisibility set fire or  your /none/ faeries  marisha i do have faerie fire you combine the two things that you said and its fantastic  travis totally meant to okay im just climbing ill follow them  matt all right everyone whos climbing i need you to roll a strength check  marisha wait whos climbing where  matt theres no actual walkway to it  laura does anybody want to ride the broom with me  taliesin ill ride the broom im not a climber  sam my gloves of swimming and climbing are those attuned items  matt i dont think they are /dung/ no  sam ill put on my gloves of swimming and climbing which i got two years ago  travis 26  marisha 19  sam i dont know what they do  matt advantage on the roll  sam oh great 16  matt 16 okay  chris 18  matt 18 all right  ashley 12  matt okay and youre floating up  laura yeah  matt all of you begin to shimmy across the surface the wind is piercingly cold the clouds  up here are dark and there isnt enough moisture to rain but there /none/ are flashes of some sort of  wild lightning storm that go off in the distance in the roiling clouds as youre making your way  across pike your foot skips across one of the stones it breaks and falls beneath you and you  almost lose yourself grog grabs you and holds you in place and pulls you back up  ashley sorry grog  travis nobody saw anything  ashley i thought i would be stronger but im still not  travis youre a champ  laura wait arent you wearing the strength gauntlets  ashley yes i /none/ am that brought me to 12  laughter  matt you all slowly make your way to the very mouth of the cavern youve been at this point as  well you wanted to go ahead and make an investigation  liam scootching in yeah  matt all right go for it  liam 24  matt 24 feeling around the exterior there are two rocks that are nearly identical placed at  each side of the cavern entrance upon approaching their texture and their weathered  appearance is far younger than the rest of the stone around them and /none/ that catches your  attention  liam do i need a further investigation check to discern their nature  matt the nature is some semblance of a magical enchantment this is a little beyond your  understanding unless you want to try and roughshod it in the way you know how  travis call me up to the front we got this  liam scanlan do you want to grab that big  sam big what  liam shale  sam oh shale  liam and yourself  sam you got a trap up there friend  liam something theres /none/ rocks up here that look a little funky and i dont think they actually are rocks  sam rocks hey keyleth you should go there are rocks you could do something with rocks  marisha i love rocks  sam yeah i know go up there with shale shales a rock go  marisha okay whats happening where am i  liam just come up a little bit slowly there are a couple of rocks up here that look a little funny to me  dont step on me  marisha oh right youre so tiny right now i keep /none/ forgetting that  chris youre very brave for someone so small  marisha do you want me to put you in a little pouch could be like a kangaroo  sam were going to die  liam another time  matt as keyleth and shale approach the threshold that youre currently standing at the rest of you  are a little ways behind he points out these two stones go ahead and both of you guys make an  arcana check shale just from what youve seen in the world  chris right 13  marisha i think like seven /none/ pretty sure my arcana its seven  matt oh druids you ascertain shale just from stumbling upon such constructions this is  theres some sort of magical essence to these rocks its old magic which is the only reason  you really recognize it its not the hoitytoitylearnedinatower magic all the  stupid people in the world tend to learn this is old magic thats all you were able to pick from it  liam you know what it is  chris old magic  laughter  liam hey dirty bard could you come up here  sam oi im /none/ here now sorry i thought that the rock people could handle it  liam all hands on deck  marisha scanlan its a very pretty rock  sam 11 on arcana  matt its old magic  sam this is old magic  laughter  sam not the kind you learn in those hoitytoity towers  ashley whats going on down there  laughter  sam cant you just melt the rocks keyleth  marisha pike these are very attractive rocks what does it look like  sam it looks like a rock melt it  marisha no what does /none/ it look like is it like a slate  matt there are two stones about three to four foot in diameter that are almost matching that  are younger less weathered than the rest of the stonework around them  chris is there any way to circumvent them or are they in opposite sides  matt theyre on opposite sides you could circumvent them theyre not in your path  marisha i can alter their shape i can melt i can do something with them  liam no just theyre not real a few steps back trickfoots  marisha what /none/ do you mean theyre not real  ashley i walk up  laura can you dispel that shit  ashley yes is it magic  sam and chris its old magic  laughter  taliesin not the kind of magic you learn in ivory towers  chris olderthanme magic  ashley thats just old  laughter  sam it sort of has that old smell to it  liam hey fuck it im going to take a good hard look at this rock  marisha hang on we might be able to circumvent it right can we go around it /none/  ashley i have dispel magic but i wonder if we should use it  sam dispel that magic  ashley but thats one of my last spells  laura well then lets avoid them lets just go around them  marisha is there room on either side of them  matt they are embedded in the sides of the wall so you could pass through them over them however  else you want to try and circumvent them  marisha how about this im going to cast stoneshape and can i carve out a little path  around one /none/ of them on the edge carve a little recess  matt you can yeah  sam see rocks i told you  marisha rocks  taliesin old rocks not the kind of rocks one finds in ivory towers  matt yes your 4thlevel stoneshape you cause a portion of the rock wall at the side of the cavern  to actually forge itself into a tunnel circumventing the exterior rock on the left  laura could you just do that the entire way into the cavern  marisha i can do it two more times all the way into the /none/ cavern  sam okay lets go through the new hole  liam im going to go ahead and im going to keep doing the same come on you big giant dummy  laura im on a broom do you want to ride it with me just kidding percys already on  liam ill stealth ahead and look around  matt okay so roll your stealth check  liam a new stealth check  matt yeah because youve come out of stealth and back into it  liam okay well i still have pass without a trace right so im at /none/ 40  matt so you make your way into the next portion youre actually able to start seeing  taliesin whoa slowly  liam you people dont see shit  laura oh thats acid  matt in a raised platform in a pool of somewhat pungentsmelling liquid as you get even  remotely close to it the fume causes your sinuses to open and burn and tingle  liam they barely get in  laura yeah cutesy voice its too small  liam im just going to hold still for a second and listen do i hear anything  matt /none/ make a perception check  liam 27  matt 27 you hear a very faint breathing breathing that is trying to stay quiet but by the  sheer immensity of the beast creating the sound you can pick up the very subtle movement of air through  the normally still cavern faint breathing noise  liam im going to quietly take im going to back up 15 feet whispers for everyone whos next to  me and for those who are not it is in here it is awake and it is waiting for us  chris what did he /none/ say  liam pike dont move  ashley im so still  liam just coming running to go when shit goes down but dont move  travis whispers what about putting her on my back  liam grog dont move yet im going to go back in for another look  sam alone  matt stealth  liam well yeah im not a barbarian im going to go along the edge closest to you and move back to  where i stopped to listen  matt about there would be in tandem with where you were  liam and im /none/ going to go another ten feet in looking  matt as he curls back the cavern is revealed further the pool does come to an end there are  pieces of stone that jut out of the floor you do see now scattered across the grounds  occasionally a bit of shine a little coin gold silver elements of wealth thatve been dragged  deeper into the cavern that have left behind them some remnants in the process of being carried and  carted in  liam if i look back can i see my sister from where i am /none/  matt actually no because shes really well stealthed  liam she cant see me either  matt no you guys have no visual perspective on each other youve all stealthed away from your  own party  liam okay theres a pool of acid right by me yeah  matt yes there is  liam is there dim light here  matt the light grows dim at about this point then it becomes darkness at about this point  liam but you said that i can see a pool  of liquid right  matt yeah what little bit /none/ of daylight thats coming in the cavern entrance would be over here  liam is the surface of the liquid flat as far as i can see  matt what you can see it is flat theres a little very faint breeze that occasionally comes  through so theres a slight disturbance here and there but no specific visual disturbance  liam how far along that pool can i actually see if you had to do a cutoff point  matt because of your darkvision being an elf you can see pretty much to the edge of this  liam /none/ okay so it doesnt look like theres a big divot  matt theres no displacement of the pool  liam im going to creep along the wall towards that pillar ill stop in that corner and then move  towards you one does it give me a better view  matt a little bit of a further view just the cavern continues in that direction  liam can i still hear the same thing  matt you can hear it very faintly you cant quite make out the source there is something  about the room and the air thats /none/ travelling through here the sound itself youre just barely catching it and  it seems to be reverberating to a small extent off the walls of this cavern which carry  sound very well  liam what do i see if i look up  matt you look up you see about 60 feet 70 feet in the air just past where your vision begins to  fade the only reason you know theres a ceiling there is because there are a few points of rock  the top of the cavern does descend into stalactites it is  chris /none/ stalactites yes  matt yes thank you  liam theres no large outcrops that this thing could be sitting on  matt not from what you can see no the mineral buildup of the inside of this cavern leads to a  direct slick surface in the walls the minerals rounded off most of the stone  liam im going to backtrack im going to find my sister and im still very little its at the  back of that cavern its not in the pool of acid thats near the front and its not just past  that it /none/ keeps going back so if were going to do this and were all just going to throw ourselves  into it and let the chips fall where they may the best thing that i can do right now is take it  unawares hurt it for as much as i can  laura are you kidding me right now  liam im not kidding you i want to kill this thing this is the first stepping stone and i  could potentially take it out catch it unawares before it vomits on all of you i want to do it /none/  and i just want to know that youre going to come in after and finish it if you need to i told you  what i want to do  laura all right i will give you a minute head start to get across the room after that im  coming in so you better hope youre at the dragon by that point  liam i start off come back and tug whispers jenga  matt make a stealth check  liam im going back to where i was  matt all right what is it  liam with /none/ pass without a trace 43  matt all right so youre back where you were the rest of you what are you doing  chris well hes a mad little one isnt he  sam hes not usually little  laughter  liam id like to go around the column and around the edge of the wall  matt this opens up slightly more and you get to see a portion of the mineral growth a lot of the  moisture that has coalesced into the ceiling has come into a central point and over time it just  built /none/ up these central columns of rock and natural materials a few pools have gathered  towards the base you see portions of the ground where elements of the acrid liquid that filled the  pool over here just dripped in whether they began this way or turned by the dragons presence you  are unaware but thats as far as you can see  liam further along the wall that little rock yeah and just a little bit past it and then  closer to you  matt at this point you can make out that additional pool of acid /none/ the far back corner and a  risen platform you see the portion of the cavernous stone beginning to mass into a higher  level towards the far back corner  liam i listen  matt roll a perception check  liam 20  matt 20 you listen in silence stillness the very faint whisper of wind far behind you  liam around the entire wall further past that pool of acid even further corner  sam has it been a minute yet  taliesin about half a minute  matt as you come around this corner being as careful /none/ as you can looking around you impact  your shoulder hits something  liam stab  matt roll initiative  liam im going to call it i mean mostly im 14 ill take it that means 19  matt all right so you have just bumped into the currently invisible form of umbrasyl lying in wait  in the far corner of the cavern that would be a 20 initiative from umbrasyl  liam fuck you  laura how long has it been  matt at this travel pace its been about  45 seconds or so  liam jenga /none/  laughter  matt you hear jenga out of the back of the earring as lets say the rest of you guys are  right here  laura i still want to be stealthed on the broom but i take off into the cavern  matt i assume trinket is in your necklace  laura yes  matt all right this is going to be you with your big stick  chris awesome  matt chilling here with the rest of the party so at the top of this round you just hear the growl  the snarl snarling you /none/ say jenga blades already at the ready you go to stab as swooshing  all of a sudden you hear this swishing sound of air being cut through at such a speed  that it causes a highpitched whine claws and teeth come spinning out of nowhere you cant even see  your attacker but you feel the brunt force behind each of these blows  liam because its invisible is there no uncanny dodge  matt no youve still got uncanny dodge on one of the attacks just from your roguish instincts  liam displacer cloak  matt correct /none/ it gets disadvantage on the first attack which is going to be a bite thats a natural  19 and a two with the two that brings it to a 17  liam nope  matt so with that you whoosh see for a split second the ripple of teeth snap before you  missing your face by mere inches before they disappear once again two more claws whoosh  towards you the first one thats a 19 again and a seven thats going to be a 22  liam just hits uncanny dodge  matt oh your ac would /dung/ be 20 because youre not hasted right now  liam oh youre right thank you  matt so that would put you at 18 points of slashing damage  liam halved to nine  matt halved to nine also your displacement is gone from your cloak  liam for this round  matt yeah for the next attack its a 19 misses you 20 yeah the second claw swings  through at this point from the pain of the first strike of the dragon claw hits you you back  up to the very edge of the cave and duck /none/ out of the way as you hear the wind change as you do  you hear the stone crash behind you as the claw misses you slamming instead to the side of the  cavern wall its now your turn  liam im going to stay right here im going to hold my turn until one of my friends is on top of  this thing and then im going to stab it  matt you hold your action until one of your friends is on it and then you move okay  liam not on it but against it /none/ attacking it melee attack  matt so that ends your turn everyone else i need you to roll initiative  marisha oh shitballs  travis balls of shit  marisha whoa percy  matt your initiative from before was  liam 19  matt so 25 to 20  laura 22  taliesin 30  marisha he rolled a natural 20  matt laughs percy  laura are you on the broom with me still  taliesin yeah im hanging so i can drop  matt so thats 20 20 to 15  chris another 19  matt another 19 /none/ nice  marisha 17  ashley 18  laura nice pike  matt so pike then keyleth  travis a mere 16  matt scanlan what did you get  laughter  sam i got an eight  matt and scanlan taking the rear  as you guys hear the crashing of stone at the far corner accompanied directly after the  whisper of vaxs cryout of jenga you already know shit is going down percy youre  up first clutching the bottom of the broom that has not moved yet what are you doing with your turn  taliesin /none/ im going to drop down ill let go of the broom im going to just fire blind where i  heard the noise coming from  matt so youre firing in this direction  taliesin yep  matt go ahead and make your attacks at disadvantage  taliesin disadvantage that is a 25  matt due to the massive size of this currently still invisible entity you do manage to catch an  odd bullet towards its form go ahead and roll damage  taliesin oh my god ten points of piercing damage  matt all righty gunshot sound gun /none/ goes off echoes little bit of dust comes loose from the  ceiling and falls down as you ready for your next shot  taliesin ill take the next shot forget it might as well go for it  matt at disadvantage  taliesin thats 20  matt this time the shot goes the second time gunshot sound poofs against some stone in the  distance not hitting its mark  taliesin third shot for the run fucking  marisha natural 20  taliesin and a one  matt so with that the third shot click nothing emerges from it /none/ and you look down its  not been a day for percy  taliesin its not been a day for percy im going to start making a dash into the corner there up  in the  matt not a dash because you used your action  taliesin no ill make a run yes to the wall  chris is that some sort of weapon  taliesin not anymore its not  matt as she takes her one good arm and cleans out missing an eye now or maybe missing an  eardrum laughs thats going to end your turn /none/ percy  taliesin oh god this is a terrible idea im going to roll and hide behind that pillar behind  me if thats okay  matt this one right here  taliesin yeah ive got to fix this  matt that brings us to vex  laura yes im going to fly on my broom as far in as i can and land maybe on that and just shoot  arrows towards where i heard it coming from i feel like i have one blazing bowstring left  because i used it once in the last battle right  /none/ matt you would still have one more use yes  laura okay then im going to try it through the blazing bowstring  matt go for it at disadvantage on this shot as you cannot see the actual entity youre firing  into the darkness  liam natural 20 and another natural 20  laura piece of shit 19  matt 19 nope  ashley oh war gods blessing  matt okay as your reaction you guide her though the blazing bowstring was unfortunately  used on the first attack that missed  laura that was just for the first /none/ attack i rolled twice for disadvantage so thats the blazing  bowstring  matt okay i misunderstood as you go for the attack you see the actual arrow bursting into flames not  quite sure where to fire youre about to pull back and aim and pike shouts to you putting her  hand out suddenly a spark of divine energy hits the front of the bow and corrects its course  beyond your actual arm motion and you release based on the faith you have in pike the arrow  strikes true you hear a slight growling roar from /none/ the distance go ahead and roll damage  pike strike good and true  laura 22  matt 22 nice  laura on my first attack if i release trinket is that an attack or is that a bonus action  matt it would say in the actual item  laura ravens slumber you can make a melee attack no thats not it bonus action to release  it im going to use a bonus action and im going to shout at trinket to go run towards my brother im going to  attack it again  matt you send /none/ trinket out ten feet in front trinket is going to go its 40 feet right  laura yeah  matt trinket rushes forward there you go make your second attack trinket goes angry bear  growls big old grizzly bear charging into the darkness growling echoing through the cavern  laura oh disadvantage 27  matt 27 with disadvantage still hits yeah your honed senses to dragonkind you can remember the  mass and general size and placement based on the sound you heard from the growls from the first  impact you made you just strike again in the /none/ same direction hitting true roll damage  laura 12  matt 12 damage  laura is that sneak attack because my brother is next to it  liam its occupied with me  laura so i would have gotten the sneak attack on both those or just on the one  matt just on the one yes ill allow it because he is currently threatening it it was a lucky  shot it was a very lucky shot  laura additional five  matt all righty good to know so total of  laura 17  matt 17 thank you /none/ both arrows done trinket rushing in  laura i want to duck down if i can behind that whatever that im standing on now  matt you can duck down but youve used most of your action in this turn to sail in and you cant hide  per se  laura okay i just want to duck behind it so im away from anything flying at me  matt makes sense all right so were now at 20 at this point in time the roar hits roaring  echoing through the cavern as the echoing begins to vibrate and /none/ the noise doesnt subside the low  hum turns instead to a buzzing as seemingly out of the pool of acid a cloud of biting stinging  insects emerges  marisha he did insect plague  matt buzzing floats in this direction getting the three of you right there ill say for the  purposes of this that you guys are both in that radius anyway this cloud of insects moves in  to i need percy shale and vex to make constitution saving throws  chris aw eight  taliesin 21  laura 18  matt 18 so you /none/ guys both being dexterous and quick but also able to maintain your form the  best you can at this turn manage to pull out of the way without too much impact however poor  shale is surrounded by the insects  chris slow and halfdeaf  matt you take 12 points of piercing damage as the insects riddle you with bites and stings  sam shale do you have any gold teeth or hidden savings accounts that we should also know about  laura she cant hear you shes deaf  matt at this point now you hear a /none/ few footfalls vax you see a splash in the pool next to you that  almost scatters against you bits of it hitting the edge of your armor but the armor absorbs the  blow being attuned towards acid resistance a few other steps as it begins to walk away ill allow  you to make an attack of opportunity with disadvantage  liam with disadvantage but yeah okay  matt yeah as you sense that its moving away you wildly swing out in front of you  liam nah 15  matt 15 whiffs on air however heavy footfalls /none/ moving forward a voice comes roaring  out into the area you dare soil my home after what youve done below i will watch you dissolve  before i suck down your liquid forms i need vex pike keyleth  scanlan and percy to all make dexterity saving throws  taliesin do i not have cover  matt not enough to prevent this its a lobbed stream of liquid acid that comes and surrounds  corroding  laura do we get advantage on any of it  matt not unless you have something that gives you advantage on him  /none/ taliesin im spending a resolve because that was bullshit can i burn another resolve goddamn it  matt nope all right so  sam can i use cutting words to buff my roll  matt you use cutting words to reduce the damage  sam but not to that seems right yeah all right 18  matt 18 all right hold on ill just doublecheck while youre saying this just to bring up  the ability  sam i should know this  matt it would have to be a damage roll because theres no attack roll theres no other /none/ roll  incorporated on this other than the damage roll  sam got it it just happens  matt right but it reduces the damage roll  which affects everybody  ashley wait i think i cast resistance i cast it on keyleth i cast it on  laura me and i think you cast it on scanlan  matt its faded since its a concentration spell  taliesin scanlans got the armor  matt yeah if you were to use cutting words on this it would reduce the damage all of you would  take from it  sam /none/ all right i will use cutting words to reduce the damage  matt what are your cutting words scanlan  sam my cutting words are your lower intestine smells like shit  laughter  matt go ahead and roll your bardic inspiration die  sam a ten shit roll three  matt so 18 saving throw what was yours  taliesin ten  matt keyleth  marisha 14  matt vex one pike  ashley seven  matt seven okay reduced by three you all suffer 47 points of acid damage  sam including me with my acid armor  /none/ matt you take half of that  laura arent you glad i gave you the armor  matt you take 23 points of acid damage after its long angry boastful diatribe as it rears back  to blow your words confuse it and the spray seems a little offcenter than what it  intended however most of you are now currently dealing with the searing pain of the acid  pressed against your bodies ending that turn vax youre up  liam did i see where the ejection of acid came out from  matt you did it came from /none/ there this area  liam am i still at a disadvantage even though i saw right where that crap came out  matt correct because you dont know if it moved away or not you dont know exactly where it is  you just know its somewhere in that vicinity  liam im going to throw two daggers at it i hope that trinkets near it but well see so at  disadvantage bollocks thats 15  matt nope  liam 22  matt 22 just hits trinket however is actually adjacent to umbrasyl so you could do sneak attack /dung/  damage  marisha whoa whats up  liam keen dagger its 26  matt 26 all right so one dagger just vanishes into the darkness the other one sticks into the  hide for a second before disappearing in a plume  of smoke reappearing at the side of your belt you hear a low  snarling grunt  liam can i use my movement to go along the back edge of the cave as far as i can directly  opposite from my family  matt all right looking at the rest of this cavern  laura look /none/ at all the gold hiding over there  matt there is what seems to be the majority of the funds that were gathered from westruun and whatever  else of the previous dragons hoard have currently been brought over to the new lair who knows how  much has been  liam i thought that was his magic healing spot but i guessed wrong  matt so that end your turn  liam yeah  matt all right now it comes to shale  chris im with insects right  matt you are currently surrounded by stinging biting insects  /none/ chris okay i will stride forth im slow and old i move 20 so ill use all my movement 40 to  advance  matt there you go you come pushing through brushing them off with your stump and your staff  waving it in front angrily growling you come to rest at the side of this one pillar that juts out  of the ground with vex right above you  chris ill dimly look into the darkness and see if i can see hear or theres just gray mist in  front of my eyes right now  /none/ matt you cant see anything but you do hear right in front of you a growling snarling bear  you see elements and flashes of the bear that you saw vex summon forth from her throat  travis and the dagger disappeared into something right  chris all right but i cant hear the dragon at all its stomping around  matt its stomping around a little bit you saw where the actual projectile came from so you know  its somewhere in this vicinity  chris well youre not very brave are you invisible hiding afraid to show your /none/ face taunt  it oh bollocks  laughter  chris well that would be a nine  matt a nine you hear slowly curling out from the darkness ahead of you bravery means nothing  survival and victory mean everything  chris oh shut up you flying suitcase  matt and thats how you end a round pike youre up  marisha oh its something my grandma would say so good  ashley yeah im going to hold my action and im going to backpack onto grog  matt okay so you move over and leap up onto grogs back /none/ holding tightly whats the trigger  for your action that youre holding  ashley on his next attack on somebody  matt the next time you sense the dragon is attacking somebody  ashley yes  matt all right what action are you holding is it a spell  ashley yes  matt so you begin preparing the spell you are now concentrating on it as youre holding the  back of grog okay holding that bit that brings us to keyleth what are you doing  marisha if i move through insect plague will i take damage or is /none/ it if i end in it  matt you dont know  chris i seemed to waltz through it  marisha thats true you waltzed through it and you didnt start in it did you  chris i did  marisha oh but you took the damage up top you didnt take damage again after you got out of it all  right i want to see if i can move im having a hard time seeing matt can i get my full movement  of 30 feet into this corner here  matt over here  marisha yeah  /none/ matt youre going to get up around there unless you want to try and go over the top of the rocks  that way is going to require a climb check  marisha oh really i can parkour it yeah  matt all right go ahead and make a strength check  marisha 14  matt yeah its not too hard you ran up grab leap over the side you can get right there  marisha oh okay i think the dragon is roughly here  matt in this vicinity you can see trinket is currently snarling and lashing out /none/ and biting in  this area of the cavern  marisha im really sorry grog im going to cast faerie fire roughly yeah somewhere where i  think he is  laura why is that bad  marisha means you dont have acid resistance anymore its a concentration spell but none of  us can see him yeah  matt all righty so faerie fire you guys watch as suddenly this burst of somewhat violetish  blue light like a small tiny explosion of glitter and starlight just hits the area and  outlines the entirety of the large dragon /none/ umbrasyl  marisha and with my bonus action  matt yeah failed saving throw  marish damn right he did with my bonus action im going to go into my  matt actually you know what  marisha hes going to do his thing isnt he  ashley you know you dont need to  matt yeah i do third and final legendary resistance you get a glimpse of where umbrasyl is  and then the magic dissipates umbrasyl vanishes from sight  sam shit  taliesin youve burned his third legendary action youve burned it its gone  sam /none/ matt did it also negate my disadvantage from cutting words on the save  matt he can succeed automatically its a choice to succeed  sam balls so thats dead too  matt nope  sam does he use the legendary action before he fails  matt no thats true yeah  sam so it kills that too  matt it does yeah  sam nice no my things dead too he doublefucked us  marisha great fuck you asshole  laura he doesnt save it like that  matt well no essentially he rolled at disadvantage to make the /none/ saving throw failed it  and then decided to succeed using legendary resistance  marisha okay but its gone theyre gone  ashley theyre gone gone  matt as far as you know from previous experience with dragons there are no further uses of its  legendary resistance  marisha what a dick  matt does that end your turn keyleth its a level one spell you still have more up your sleeves if you  wanted to try it later  marisha i know i dont think im going to go into my beast shape form so i can /none/ do another  spell next turn can i just tuck and see if i could take a bonus action to hide in this little  nook and cranny here  matt you cant use a bonus action to hide unfortunately  marisha because im not a rogue  matt because youre not a rogue sorry girl  marisha can i hug that pillar and say panting  matt you can totally do that and you are currently hugging in the pillar going panting  at the end of keyleths turn its going to use two of its legendary actions to /none/ wing attack its  going to beat its wings everything within 15 feet which right now would only be trinket has to go ahead  and succeed on a dexterity saving throw go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw for trinket  laura im going to roll the brown  dice for trinket dexterity 12  matt 12 okay so trinket takes 15 points of bludgeoning damage  laura hes resistant to bludgeoning  matt because of the armor  laura yes  mat so takes seven points of bludgeoning damage however he is still knocked prone from the /dung/ blast  of wind that whooshes through the entirety of the cavern causing dust to raise up the cloud of  insects gets shifted a little bit before having to reform back into its place from the sheer force  in doing so suddenly theres a rush of air and two giant slamming sounds as feet have placed  themselves right up front with shale and vax vex ive got a lot to concentrate on  sam when i die im coming back as a character named vix  matt then you can find another dungeon master all right so /none/ that ends keyleths turn grog  youre up  travis i take the tiny pike backpack and i would like to run along the right the farther wall from  you opposite direction  matt this way  travis yes  matt all right  travis 50 feet using diagonals to try and get as far around that pool as i can  matt thats about as far as you can get there so thats movement with pike on your back so thats  your movement  travis yep and ill use my bonus action to go into a rage /none/  matt all right growling  travis hey pike gimme a slap  ashley slap  travis growls  matt sends you into the rage you still have your action anything you want to do  travis nope  matt are you holding your action for any particular thing  travis well i cant really hit him from here  matt all right that ends grogs turn scanlan youre up  sam i cant see him right  matt not from what you can tell no  sam balls i can see vex right and shale oh shit i cant /none/ do much without seeing him oh  heres what i will do ill start by inspiring shale i will just step out and sing singing and i  will always buff you and then i will pick  a place and cast stinking cloud  matt okay you take your d10 inspiration die  chris excellent  matt and stinking cloud havent seen that in a while  sam no oh well its too late i already said it  matt stinking cloud where are you setting it  sam can i have a pointer well ill just come over /none/ right here  matt right there all right well put this over here to keep track of the stinking cloud well just  know the insects are in this vicinity as most people have passed beyond it with that umbrasyl is  going to attempt a constitution saving throw three plus 14 thats a 17 whats the dc  sam 20  matt all right that will technically be at the start of its turn but we will carry that over  all right the cloud appears in this space you can already hear coughing are you going to move /none/  or stay where you are  sam theres no more cloud of insects yeah  matt its still in this vicinity  sam is there any way to avoid it move up to where kiki is or anything  matt yeah if you want to make a strength check to climb  sam all right ill do that ill move up  to where kiki is 17  matt 17 yeah you actually hopscotch up leap over percy and get up on top next to her over there  sam oh percy didnt notice your bald spot there  /none/ taliesin it just grows in lighter  sam sure  matt all right that ends your turn scanlan with that its going to use its third legendary  action this turn to attempt a tail attack against you vex  laura thank you  matt youre welcome  liam thats vix  matt i will stab you that is a 19 to hit  laura nope 20  matt 20 with that you dodge out of the way you feel the impact of some large heavy slam onto  the stone right next to you pieces of it break off /none/ and then withdraws barely dodging it in  time all right that ends  ashley since he made an attack can i  matt yes you can  ashley i would like to command him to be visible reveal himself  matt whats the word  ashley reveal appear  matt appear there you go oh thats cocked all right that is a19 plus 11 im pretty sure it  makes the save  ashley fuck you  matt sorry  ashley do i still get a bonus action  matt that wouldve been during your turn you can only /none/ hold your action  ashley snarls frustratedly  matt good try brings us to the top percy youre up  taliesin oh god okay im going to take a second to try and pray that my second gun doesnt break  because thats going to get really ugly and it doesnt my gun is fine  matt all right  taliesin my gun is fine but thats it im going to start running straight down as far as my legs  will take me not that way towards the pool  matt towards the pool  taliesin right there oh /none/ no thats the insects thats right so yeah  marisha as long as you get out of it  taliesin im going to roll around to the stone to the right then as far as i can go  matt you can get there youre outside of the insect cloud not a worry as youre running  youre cleaning it polishing loading it okay looks good  taliesin oh yes im going to spend my bonus action to do a quick heal  matt okay your second wind  taliesin my second wind  matt go for it  taliesin /none/ oh god that was awful thats okay so yeah good you can move on sorry  matt okay vex  laura do i have any kind of sense of ugh your stinking cloud is right there  matt yeah you do see some elements of the cloud are displaced in places its not showing you  exactly where it is but you are aware that the entity of umbrasyl is directly in front of shale and  nearly directly in front of you  marisha enough to negate the disadvantage  matt no not to mention the fact that you /none/ are technically in its melee range so any of your  ranged attacks  laura are at disadvantage again right  matt unless its five foot is it five foot or is it melee trying to remember i think its five  feet but regardless its close to you its bad news  laura if trinket gets up does that use any of my stuff trinket can move freely  matt trinket can move independently of you  laura so trinket is going to get up  matt its halfmovement yeah  laura and hes going to bite umbrasyls tail /none/ to try to distract him so i can run between his legs  matt okay so trinkets going to go ahead and roll a perception check for trinket  liam trinket snack attack  laura oh hes got a keen sense of smell so hes got advantage on smell perception  matt but there is a stinking cloud right there roll again well see if trinket can discern  between  laura well i rolled a 15 and i dont know what i add to it  matt that would be trinkets wisdom  laura oh perception seven so 22 /none/  matt 22 okay trinket bear sniffs and growl runs past here but can only make 20 feet of its  movement because he used the rest to get out of prone however strafes aside and begins  reaching out and starts snapping so you want to give trinket  laura hes going to attack him  matt okay as part of your attack action is that what youre doing  laura yeah im going to have trinket do one of his attacks so i can move and run  matt as your bonus action on it okay go for /none/ it have trinket roll for an attack with disadvantage  because it is invisible  laura that doesnt count i feel like it still counts though its only 15  matt 15 trinket slashes out in the air with the obfuscation of the stinking cloud and the  invisible dragon trinkets just getting mouthfuls of air  laura what does stinking cloud do to me  marisha and sam makes you sick  laura fuck i try to run away i try to run around and run past umbrasyl  sam youre not in the cloud  laura but i /none/ would go through it if i tried to run between its legs ill just try to run along to  the side  matt on the broom still  laura sure why the fuck not im on the broom does it matter  matt i mean that will give you a little more action you just cant attack from the broom  because youll have disadvantage on your attacks since you havent finished your setup yet  laura jesus i just want to run on the

going to get further away  liam rogue bonus action hide dash disengage  matt yes you can  /none/ laura yeah im going to hide behind those things  matt there  laura yeah  matt okay you can get there however as you rush by umbrasyl does get an attack of  opportunity on you hes going to make a bite as you rush by that is going to be a 30 to hit  laura i think that hits  matt all right  ashley isnt it at a disadvantage since hes in smoke  matt huh  laura because hes in farts  matt no thats not quite what it does  laughter  matt oh /none/ thats a d10 sorry you take 25 points of piercing damage plus an additional eight points  of acid damage from the inside of its mouth  laura cool tight tight  matt a total of 33 points of damage as you rush past all right that ends your turn vex  laura oh that it does  matt all right the insect cloud fades away insects just dying off and dropping to the ground  in piles of currently twitching insects however the acid pools suddenly begin to rumble and expand  and reach out  laura im glad /none/ i hid by another acid pool  matt any creature within 20 feet of the pool has to make a strength saving throw so that will be  shale grog pike and vex  laura yay  chris five  sam you have inspiration if you want to use it  ashley what are we rolling for  laura a strength or a dex saving throw  matt strength  travis 23  matt 23 good to know pike  ashley 21  matt all right  laura 13  matt 13 and five all right so you guys both /none/ manage to as the pool swishes out and comes up  to your knees grog and you just pull back and lean against the wall as the pool subsides back  no immediate effect just barely manages to catch you however both shale and vax are pulled 20  feet into the pool  laura vex  matt im sorry vex i keep saying it now over and over again pulled into the actual  acid pool  laura its like adding insult to injury youre going to die and im going to call you your  brother the entire /none/ time  matt yep im sorry about that you both are knocked prone and pulled into the water because  it is an acid pit you both also suffer 12 points of acid damage both shale and vex  marisha thats a thing that can happen all right  matt all right now umbrasyl who failed the saving throw  sam gets to spend his entire turn coughing  matt i cant believe stinking cloud worked  sam spends his entire turn  matt the creature spends its action retching and reeling  liam i hope he coughs his innards /none/ out the hole in his gut dragon hernia  matt yep so the action is spent the dragon is just coughing which is good because it rolled a  five and got its breath weapon back but it cant use it this turn because its coughing and you  i will  it rears back about to spit the acid before coughs and bits of it come streaming out  of the nose like the milkinthenostrils thing except for its acid thats the dragon okay  that ends its action it is going to move out see if its i /none/ forgot to roll concentration for the  invisibility on the last attack that happened i just rolled a one with that it appears once  again on the map the invisibility spell no longer there  marisha oh thank god  laura now we can watch it kill us  matt its going to stomp over out of the cloud right there  sam does trinket get an attack  matt he does actually go ahead and roll for trinket  laura yeah he does i dont know which one to roll here theyve all been betraying me 17  /none/ matt 17 that misses or it hits and trinkets claws streak across the back of the dragons hide  no damage sustained but good job trinket all right so  laura hes trying man

sister im going to drag her out and im going to pop the one  healing potion i have down her gullet  matt okay  liam /none/ im going to pull her behind so were both behind that pillar  matt okay so you pull her behind the pillar you go ahead and feed her the healing potion that is  your turn he dragged you out of the acid pool  liam potion of greater healing  matt all right so that is a 4d4 plus four healing to you that ends vaxs turn shale  youre up  chris all right im going to stand up if i can and make my way back onto firm rock do i take  any damage when i /none/ start my turn  matt you do actually you take six points of acid damage youve now stepped up right there  the dragon is fully visible to you  chris pick on someone your own size and i whack him on the derriere with my staff  matt go for it you have three attacks correct  chris the first one is a very sad 14 im not going to waste the d10 on that  matt across the hide no damage  chris oh my god  marisha no chris no  sam

second wind  matt all right go for it  chris to regain 15 hit points  matt 15 hit /none/ points to you go for it ending  shales turn that brings us to pike but at the  end of shales turn the dragon is going to use a legendary action to attempt a tail attack  against you scanlan as you are the source of the stinking cloud that caused it to cough it  goes growls foolish bard get back into my stomach and as it whips around its tail comes  streaking overhead and it rolls a natural one  cheering  matt as it spins around thats when your staff actually hits the back of /none/ its hide as it does it  gooses it a little in a sensitive place and the tail arcs strangely and slams  into the stone next to you missing you by about six inches  sam ah great ill take it  matt pike its your turn  ashley all right singsong im going to guiding bolt him right up the butt  laughter  matt youre in the position for it  ashley yep  matt what level are you casting guiding bolt  ashley third  matt third level on guiding bolt all right that will put /none/ it at 6d6 so go ahead and roll a spell  attack  ashley natural 20  matt go ahead and roll 6d6 and well double it  ashley and double it  matt its a critical hit  ashley ive never done that before  chris right up the butt  marisha monstah kill him  liam taliesin and marisha kancho  ashley oh my god 24 one more so 50 points  matt 50 points of radiant damage right up umbrasyls posterior suddenly as pike still  clutching onto the back of grog you reach and grab the /none/ symbol of sarenrae leaving your sword to the side of  your sheath hold it forward and as you do you concentrate a glowing beam of radiant energy  shoots forward just as shale knocks the backside of umbrasyl the tail streaks overhead to hit  scanlan leaves you a nice direct shot right at the dragon rump theres a dull impact sound  and umbrasyl sits straight up for a second confused noise explosion as theres a burst of  divine explosive energy right in the posterior painful growl looking back theres now a shiny  glow pulsing from /none/ the back of umbrasyls body and the next attack has advantage against  umbrasyl  ashley still alive  matt thats your action you still have your movement and bonus if you want  ashley okay i think im going to stay and then bonus action im going to throw up a spiritual  weapon  matt okay where do you want your spiritual weapon to go what level is spiritual weapon  second level yep  ashley yeah a really large meathook  matt all right where are you setting it  ashley right at his back  matt /none/ all right sitting right there at the tail of umbrasyl this giant glowing radiant meathook  appears and makes its strike go ahead and make your spell attack against umbrasyl  ashley 27  matt all right that hits go ahead and roll damage its a 1d8 plus five  ashley ten  matt nice all right going to stay where you are or you going to move  ashley im going to stay with my grog  matt so youre still piggybacking on grog got it okay that ends pikes turn keyleth youre  up actually at the end /none/ of pikes turn  ashley you know what im sorry im going to get off his back  matt okay youre staying where you are though  ashley yeah  matt okay so youll be there at the end of your turn umbrasyls going to use another  legendary action to make a second tail attack at scanlan again frustrated by this whole  circumstance  sam im sure he is  matt thats a 20  sam can i use cutting words  matt you may if you want to  sam all right  matt its a natural /none/ 20  sam oh  matt you could reduce the damage though with your cutting words  sam all right ill do that  matt probably for the best for that you suffer 28 points of bludgeoning damage as the tail  swoops down finding its mark slamming into you sending you against the wall of the stonework and  you stumble forward back into place feeling already the impact of the bludgeoning wound  sam thats a four so  matt so you reduce that to 24  taliesin that halved no thats not halved sorry brain  matt /none/ so 24 points of bludgeoning damage from the attack however umbrasyls next saving throw is  at a disadvantage because of mythcarver now keyleth what are you doing  marisha okay faerie fire poof right in front of me right on top of him it gives everybody  advantage on attacks against him  matt yes it does  laura thats great  marisha i hope hes got enough hit points to make it worth it  matt with disadvantage on the saving throw  marisha yeah take it bitch glitter bomb its like a kesha music video  matt /none/ so thats a four plus nine because of the disadvantage i rolled a ten and a four that will  bring it to 13 it does not succeed you watch as a second burst of purplish energy surrounds  umbrasyl radiating a glow  chris whos the prettiest dragon  marisha youre so pretty  matt gilmore would love this right now fancy dragon now were talking you went from being  not able to see the dragon to very much being able to see the dragon all right  marisha im going to use my bonus action to turn /none/ into a water elemental  matt okay look at you being a druid and shit  marisha yeah thats how i roll  travis and marisha get it girl get it get it girl  matt water elemental keyleth are you going to stay there  marisha can i move  matt if youd like to  marisha am i in his range of attack  matt you gather yes pretty big range  marisha honestly umbrasyl is so fucking big i cant see whats going on in front of me  matt youre right there  marisha is scanlan /none/ in front of me  matt scanlan is right next to you to the right  marisha can i step in the front and shield scanlan  matt unfortunately the cliff ends right there so you couldnt get in front of scanlan without  dropping onto a lower platform  marisha what about anybody else  matt percy is down there you could fill some of umbrasyls space but youre not going to be able  to guard anybody from an attack unfortunately especially being an entity made of water not  a whole lot of defensive strategy in there /dung/  marisha okay im next to shale as well right were all in the shit together  matt shales over here  marisha oh shales over there  matt flanking from the side  marisha you know what im just going to stay there  matt all right grog youre up  travis i would like to run along the side of the pool and up on his left side closest to the  entrance of the cave right there would be delicious  matt there you go  travis i would like to go into a frenzied rage a /none/ regular strike on the first  matt you already have advantage on all the attacks because of faerie fire so you dont need  travis yeah not reckless not great weapon  matt yeah go for it  taliesin is that a 20  ashley oh oh that would be a natural 20  sam oh thats not going to be good for him  matt barbarian crits man  travis i keep rolling yeah  matt well do the damage for the critical yeah  taliesin this and the next round are going to be really ugly  marisha /none/ kill it fucking kill it  travis 24  matt 24 okay  travis is the roll and then what double it or add another  matt the dice roll is well you roll 1d12 what was that the first d12 you rolled  travis that was a 15 oh the dice roll 12  matt 12 so make a it was a 12  travis yeah  matt oh shit okay thats a 24 and then you add your modifier and then roll two more d12s  so thats 24 plus is that seven  travis yeah  matt /none/ plus the two for the axe oh my god thatll be at 33 plus the necrotic oh fuck and thats  doubled too  travis so thats an 11 for the second d12  matt okay  laura should we write these numbers down  matt yeah we have to now so its 24 plus two for the axe plus seven for the strength  travis plus five for the necrotic  matt hold on getting there were getting there its getting math crunchy here guys so 24 plus  nine so thats 33 plus the necrotic  travis five /none/  matt times two which is ten thats 43 plus the two other d12s which is an 11 so thats 54 plus  your last d12  travis its a ten  matt you did 64 points of damage with this one critical hit  ashley hes a monstah  travis marisha and laura monstah  matt all right so thats your first attack  travis yeah  chris dragons like hello  marisha disco dragon  travis 20  matt 20 the first strike swings wide and slams deep into an already open wound left by a rogue  /none/ earlier in the sky this time the axe sinks deep into its body and umbrasyl roars out in immense pain  you see spittle and blood both being jettisoned from its mouth under the sheer pain that its feeling  you take the axe and you push even deeper and push even deeper and withdraw as you do the blade is  entirely covered in deep purplishblack dragon blood you swing for a second strike this time  it puts its claw out and catches the axe in the middle of the air you manage to wrench it free  /none/ from its grasp but it turns its head toward you angrily  ashley can i use war gods blessing again  matt that is channel divinity ill go ahead and doublecheck here real fast  marisha we also have heroes feast up by the way if that makes any amount of difference  matt it wont do anything it helped you with the temporary hit points it helped you with  sam marisha and liam fear  matt it helped you with the fearresistance to begin with that was a big one  channel divinity war gods blessing and you /none/ can channel divinity twice so you can do it a  second time you can wait didnt you use it between rests yeah you could do it a second time  if you want to  ashley yeah  matt all right so with that with a plus ten brings it to 30 so as umbrasyl grabs the axe stopping it in  midair you just grin reach forward with the axe and push it into its actual claw go  ahead and roll damage  travis you nasty boy 27  matt 27 points of damage all right and /none/ do you want to use your bonus action  travis i do  matt yes you do  travis lets do it great weapon master just for kicks  matt all right  travis 26 minus five is 21  matt 21 as you push the blade into umbrasyls hand angry snarl it rears back its head and  snaps toward you you duck out of the way pull the blade back and go for a third strike this  time however it actually rears its torso up putting its claws in the air and you slicing  find air /none/ right beneath it does not strike true  travis cool good beans  matt yeah that finishes grogs turn at the end of grogs turn its going to use its third legendary  action to go ahead and make a actually no its going to hold onto that legendary action all  right that brings us to scanlan  sam jesus its not dead yet  matt scanlan because you took the tail attack earlier ill have you roll a concentration check  for stinking cloud you have advantage on it though so add your constitution bonus  sam 20 /none/  matt yeah youre fine  sam great ive got my stinking cloud still i would like to move the stinking cloud oh no i  cant do that  matt you can  sam you can move a stinking cloud  matt i think it moves from a short breeze actually  sam eh its fine  matt older versions i think you could  sam i dont want the stinking cloud to move all right hes right on us hes got a legendary  action this is not good okay i will reintroduce him to bigbys hand singing /none/ bigbys hand and  im going to use it as an ugh so weak interposing hand  matt bigbys interposing hand all righty  laura what is that  sam it will block him its a talktothehand move  matt the idea is you can use your bonus action to set it each turn to what you want it to do so  right now youre having it as an interposing hand so yeah it prevents it from moving  sam wait just moving it can still attack  matt the interposing hand interposes between you and a creature you /none/ choose until you give it a  different command it stays between the two of you providing you halfcover against the target  so it helps from ranged attacks  sam oh but it wont block an attack so in that case ill just attack with it  matt okay so youre just going to go and clenched fist  sam im going to try to finger it right in the hole that i came out of before  matt of course you are go ahead and make a melee spell attack  sam hes the bigby and the dike /none/  matt that would be over here  sam what do i roll d20  matt d20 add your spell attack modifier  sam oh 27 oh with advantage 27  matt 27 that hits go ahead and roll 4d8 force damage as bigby angrily jams the magical finger  back into the wound  ashley rage fingering  liam this dragon is being violated in so many ways  sam its just ten 4d8 plus what  matt its 4d8 force damage  sam thats it ten  matt ten points of force damage  sam yes  liam /none/ not like this  matt all right scanlan are you going to move or stay where you are  sam if i move hell kill me so i wont instead i will wheres vax  matt vax is over here  sam way over there  liam playing medic with my sister  laura hey  sam jesus  who can i inspire i guess ill inspire good old shale again you dont need inspiration  youre fine this is an old lady  ill turn to shale and say

to hold me in your arm tonight  laughter  chris have you ever had sex  laughter  sam no  taliesin it was just hanging there  sam yes ive had sex shale i have a daughter  matt he says this as a giant bigbys hand is just impact sounds at the side of a giant black  dragon that brings us to /town/ the top of the initiative round percy its your turn oh my god  taliesin okay how close am i to this dragon  matt you are about ten feet from it right now  taliesin im walking right the fuck up to it  matt okay percy you walk right up to the dragon  taliesin im pulling out the sword and im going to fucking town screaming like a little girl the  entire time  marisha kill it advantage  taliesin with advantage  marisha all day advantage all day  laura kill that fucking dragon  /none/ taliesin 26

22 just hits go ahead and roll damage  taliesin thats 18 /none/ points of slashing damage  matt all right  taliesin action surge motherfucker  matt go for it  chris going ginsu on this dragon  matt i know seriously  taliesin it is not an awesome hit its just a hit im really excited 18 points of damage  matt all right  taliesin shot number two  sam oh my god  taliesin thats a hit  laura natural 20  taliesin natural 20 this is to make up for all these fucking ones  laura why doesnt percy just always attack melee  marisha hes bad at /none/ it most of the time  taliesin 47 points of damage final attack  sam wait what  liam how is this possible  marisha because hes a fighter he gets three attacks per round  taliesin plus an action surge for a second attack set of three so im basically going yeah  marisha its like a john wu film  taliesin its just a fucking john wu attack oh my god it hit just barely because it was a one  otherwise and that final hit is oh thats good 27 points of damage and im done  /dung/ matt as you unload on umbrasyl the pentup anger and frustration you start slashing over and over  again you guys watch as the blade shines in the air in the presence of its naturally designed  enemy you see at the corners of his outfit little tufts of dark smoke beginning to appear  the scar of orthax still shows when the fury builds within percy as each blow strikes cutting  away hunks and bits of dragon flesh and scale umbrasyl is heavily wounded and looking desperate  that ends your turn i believe  laura oh my /none/ god hes still alive  matt you guys gave it time to rest  taliesin fuck it bonus action im putting on the mask and standing my ground fuck it  matt amazing what a dragon can do in two hours  taliesin yeah im done  matt all right vex  laura hi okay im going to  matt actually at the end of percys turn hes going to use his third legendary action knowing  the source of the faerie fire and extremely frustrated by the fact that it has lent to a very  difficult round it /none/ turns towards the now water elemental quivering before it and the tail comes  down to smash towards your liquid form  marisha burbling  matt speaking of natural 20s  taliesin its okay  marisha come on bitch come on  taliesin youre fine  marisha totally fine im an elemental for a reason  taliesin you are totally fucking fine  matt 32 points of bludgeoning damage  marisha halved  matt halved because of your elemental does water elemental have resistance to damage  marisha yeah it has damage resistance against acid bludgeoning piercing slashing from  /none/ nonmagical weapons  matt all right so half that so 32 made to 16 16 points of bludgeoning damage i need you to go  ahead and roll a concentration check  marisha what did you say  matt roll a concentration check so roll a d20 and add your constitution modifier  taliesin even if it goes it was worth it  marisha not bad not bad hang on sorry just my straight modifier its not a save okay 18  matt you maintain concentration you needed to beat the 16  marisha whoa daddy all right  matt /none/ well half the damage no it wouldve been ten actually because its half the damage you  receive  marisha half the damage i receive so yeah im good im golden  matt all right cool so vex what are you doing  laura oh jeez who all is within five feet of it is everybody within five feet of it  matt a lot of them are pretty much the whole party aside from pike you and your brother  laura then im just going to attack it twice  taliesin with advantage  sam oi matt my bigbys /none/ is concentration so that clouds gone by the way  matt correct thank you  laura 19 plus 12 hits  sam did you shoot it in the back  matt yes it does go ahead and roll damage  laura can i hunters mark him  matt as a bonus action  laura yeah  matt all right good memory on that one  laura 19 on the first hit  matt 19 damage all right  laura then the second one hits as well 17 plus 12  matt yep go ahead and roll damage for the second /dung/ hit  laura 23  matt 23 all right so ending your turn comes to the top of the round umbrasyl now gripping into  the stone i will not fall suddenly darkness begins to sweep into the area in this area a  15foot radius all completely around umbrasyl all of you in this area your vision goes dark  liam cancels out faerie fire and the golden butt  matt cancels out faerie fire this is magical darkness  sam its not a spell right  liam for those of us on the outside do we see a /none/ bubble of darkness where key and the others  sam a spell matt  matt no this is an effect of the lair actually faerie fire would still affect it if you attacked  it per se but it doesnt reveal its location currently within the darkness however it is  technically larger than the darkness regardless all of you guys that are in there it would negate  the advantage you would have from faerie fire it would just be a central attack  marisha so it wouldnt give us disadvantage it would just be straight rolls  matt /dung/ a little bit of its piercing through because it is magic on magic however the rest of  you see most of the party disappear into a giant sphere of magical darkness that fills the space  laura so we on the outside we cant use faerie fire its just a bubble of dark or do we see  umbrasyl peeking out  liam he said hes bigger than the dark so we see his head coming out  matt you see the wings poking out the sides of it you still see where he would be okay so with /none/  that umbrasyl is going to go ahead and take a risk hes going to lift his wings and head upward  to move into an advantageous position  sam no its not  marisha come on come on scanlan  sam im going to say you leave when burt reynolds says you can fucking leave and i will  bigbys hand and i will bring him back down because i get a spell on his retreat  taliesin i love watching him look at the phone  marisha consult the helix  matt unfortunately you have to be grasping /none/ it or grappling it to attempt to  sam no i get a full spell action its my lore feature i get to cast a brand new fucking spell  when he lifts off  matt which one  sam college of lore if he retreats i get to cast a spell this is the exact same thing that  happened last time  matt trying to remember how this works college of lore i dont know if it is because what you  do is you grapple  sam oh no its a war caster feature  matt oh /none/ war caster thank you that clarifies it i was like i dont see this in the college of  lore youre confusing me so as a war caster when a hostile creatures movement provokes an  opportunity attack from you you can use your reaction to cast a spell at the creature rather  than making an opportunity attack so yeah if you wanted to go ahead and attempt to grapple  sam i will grapple him and pull him back down  matt you can totally attempt that bigby go ahead and make a strength athletics check to beat /none/  a dragons strength bigby is just slightly under the strength of the dragon so lets see its a  rolloff  sam its a rolloff oh my god this is a critical roll thats a two  matt it was a 19 on my end natural 19 as bigbys hand reaches forward the angry wounded  frustrated furious umbrasyl just kicks the hand away pulling up  taliesin do we get an attack of opportunity  matt attack of opportunity from you you you and you  marisha down bitch down  ashley and the spiritual weapon right and /none/ the spiritual weapon  matt no it does not get attacks of opportunity  marisha without advantage even though hes retreating  matt without advantage because of the magical darkness that has surrounded you guys  marisha even though hes retreating in faerie fire that doesnt double it  matt the darkness would give you disadvantage the faerie fire negates that im letting you do this  marisha okay letting you do this be thankful of what you have 22 exactly  matt that hits  taliesin 20  chris my staff bounces right off  matt okay grog  /none/ travis 23  matt all right so grog and keyleth both get a hit in go ahead and roll damage  marisha shit balls low shit eight damage from the elemental  travis 20  matt 20 all right  travis 25 plus the necrotic  matt good to know  marisha and we decided i dont get my fire hands when im a water elemental  matt because thats bullshit  marisha yeah all right  taliesin that would just be steam  matt so as you swing out you arc and the axe strikes across the back of /none/ umbrasyls hide you  slam with your water elemental form the flight is staggered and barely lands on his feet umbrasyl  i will take you all down unleashes  marisha here it comes  matt i need a dexterity saving throw from shale percy keyleth and scanlan  laura oh its that whole table  sam seven  chris 24  marisha 12  taliesin 18  matt all right shale actually succeeded on that one dc 23  marisha dc 23  matt so you take half damage on that one thats going to be doing the dice /none/ rolls here so thats  62 points of acid damage down to 31 to shale and 31 to you because youre resistant so 62 points  of acid damage to both of you guys  sam my armor does that do anything  matt your armor takes it by half so you would take 31  taliesin 62 okay  chris cursed lizard were going to give all your treasure to the poor  matt and with that it takes the rest of its action to move further back at its 80 foot flight  and its going to end /none/ up right about there  sam its too big to fit in its own house  matt i know leaving the spiritual weapon there all right thats going to end its turn that now  brings it to vax  liam the twins still have advantage because its got the faerie fire on it right you said  everyone in it  matt oh you need to make a concentration check by the way from the damage you just took  marisha did he get out of the darkness  matt he did  marisha ooh ouch not good at /none/ all what am i making just a constitution check  matt add your constitution modifier  marisha i dont think its going to be enough eight  matt the faerie fire fades as the acid consumes you no longer affected by it  marisha shit  matt all right vax its your turn to answer your question no  liam nobodys near it anymore right  matt nope  liam okay i would like to scrabble up behind it as close to its treasure pile as i can get  matt okay that would be about there  liam and /none/ im going to throw shit no cancel that id like to run up its tail  matt okay you go rushing clambering onto the back of its tail it swoops around and sees you  doing so but youre already quick and on it what are you going to do  liam im going to hold my action until somebody gets up on this motherfucker and as soon as  somebody gets close and catches his attention im going to stab into it  matt okay good to know all right that takes the end of vaxs turn shale youre /none/ up  chris i stride up to the dragon and smack it on the nose  travis atta girl shale  matt speed of 20 feet you said  chris yeah  matt you cant quite get to it unfortunately thats about as far as you can move this turn you  can dash if you want to but even so you still cant quite get to it  chris all right then i will use all my action to get as close to it as i can  matt okay there we go all right ending shales turn pike /none/ youre up  ashley okay i didnt realize i was up so quickly all right  chris although actually i have action surge  matt you do actually  chris so i will then whack him on the nose  matt thats true  marisha fuck yes  chris all right so thats going to be  taliesin i have 13 hit points  sam 13  i thought that said 93  taliesin i count up  chris 22  matt 22 that just barely hits go ahead and roll damage  chris so i whack it for nine /none/  matt nine points of damage got it  liam im above it do i get advantage for that  matt technically because you are behind you are flanking it so as well use the flanking rules  for this you do have advantage on the attack  liam okay so good 29  matt 29 hits go ahead and roll damage with sneak attack  liam 24  matt 24 all righty  liam and is the bonus action gone because of holding the action  matt correct yeah you just get the one action to hold  liam /none/ add one point to that it was

both streaking across the face the second one actually cutting through one of the eyes the  eye bursts against the blade of bloodaxe and you can see now the fluids and material that once were  /none/ contained within are now spilling down the side of umbrasyls face  travis aint you pretty  matt all right scanlan  sam what me  matt that was your bonus action  sam oh well okay i didnt know that i will try something else then i will send shit i  will send my lightning bolt can i see any part of him thats not inhabited by one of my allies  matt id say theres an arc you could probably hit yeah  sam right in the heart  matt sure the heart region of the dragon /none/  sam im going to shoot him right through the heart with lightning  matt all right that is a dexterity 21 save so im pretty sure its halved  sam yeah that saves  matt go ahead and roll 8d6 half damage  liam shot through the heart  sam i dont know that song i dont know what that is i dont know that  song 24 so just 12  matt 12 points of lightning damage all right the bolt of lightning bursts through the body all  righty that comes to the top of the round /none/ at the end of scanlans turn its going to use a  legendary action to strike down with the tail onto vax behind as you are already in that  vicinity  liam dex save  matt no this is instead going to be a 26 to hit  liam yeah that oh displacer cloak did you do that at disadvantage  matt that is instead a 24 to hit  liam that does hit ill use uncanny dodge though  matt all right so what would be 18 damage you take nine instead from the tail percy  taliesin /none/ im going to take three shots from where im at first im going to use my bonus action to  chug down that potion i just got whats the superior worth  sam greater  matt its a greater yes 4d4 plus

face im going to hit his other eye come on natural 20 /none/  sam i feel like we need to retire the dice  taliesin fuck no no i love this die  marisha you witnessed it  chris yeah  marisha youre a third party its good  travis have you and wheaton ever touched  taliesin yeah and i had a really bad day afterward let me tell you that didnt turn out  too well thats just 16 points of damage and i dont think i get anything bonus for this he has  to make a constitution saving throw  chris eyeball saving throw  taliesin or hes /none/ going to have disadvantage on all of his attacks for the next turn  matt okay that is nine plus 14 23  taliesin yeah no hes fine  matt dragons  taliesin i know it was worth a shot im going to take another shot fuck it im just going to  go for a sharpshooter to try and do a little bit more damage to this and im going to burn another  grit and get advantage on it  matt okay  taliesin so advantage sharpshooter and thats a good thing because that was terrible and that /none/  was also terrible so i miss  matt all right second shot the first one boom slams and blasts near the ocular socket of  umbrasyl shattering the bone but not actually damaging the eye the second shot manages to go  through the wing but unfortunately the area was already damaged and its minimal in the effect on  the dragon third strike  taliesin yeah third strike here we go actually you know what im going to go for  advantage im going to go for sharpshooter advantage one more time just for shits and  giggles /none/ jesus do i call it  matt it fell to the table  taliesin so yeah i miss  matt two other shots unfortunately bang  taliesin im going to hide im going to pull top right and go up im going up and im getting the  fuck back there as far back as i can get  matt okay end of percys turn going to use another legendary action to slam with the tail  once again towards you vax this is going to be  liam this is in the same round so theres no more disadvantage /none/  matt correct 25  liam sure and do i blow uncanny dodge now  matt you only get one reaction so yeah thats going to be 22 points of bludgeoning damage  whack the tail comes down and slams into you putting you facefirst into the stone you can  feel the blood run from your nose from the impact as the tail picks back up again vex youre up  laura im going to attack him a couple times how about that no advantage anymore though huh  marisha no it failed  laura 18 on the first /none/ one doesnt hit  matt arrow just splinters across the dragons hide  laura that first one was way better i shouldve kept it  matt what was the second one  laura the second one was 16  matt 16 the second arrow strikes the side of umbrasyls face unfortunately once again the  wood shaft streaks across broken and destroyed by the impact that ends your turn  laura no i still have a bonus action so im going to hide with my bonus action  matt okay you can do that roll stealth did you add sneak /none/ attack oh no because nothing hit  sorry  laura really  matt sorry i was trying to be mindful  laura did you really just do that  matt trying to help failing miserably but trying  laura do i still have pass without trace  matt no hunters mark got rid of that  laura 20  matt okay good to know top of the round magical darkness fills this entire sphere once  more encapsulating grog vax and everybody else in the area of the dragon vision is taken you  are all considered blind and have /none/ disadvantage on any attack rolls  laura who all  matt dragon does not seem to be  liam and is it were blinded or were blind where we are  matt blind where you are  travis dragon does not seem to be  matt affected by it  laura im not affected by that though because im outside of the bubble  matt correct yes actually let me see something  travis that dumb grin  matt with a five yep  marisha breath recharged  matt umbrasyl is going to turn up towards you grog the head /none/ peeks out of the darkness for a  second right before it fills your space and it just says i will finish this you hear a  familiar sound of gurgling and then liquid spray out another time this is going to go for  everything in that vicinity thats going to be keyleth shale grog trinket and percy  taliesin did i not get cover  matt you couldnt move that far unfortunately thats as far as you could go with your movement  taliesin okay  matt so i need a dexterity saving throw from all of you /none/ guys  marisha fuck  taliesin blowing my last reroll thats better  marisha its like a 23 save right  matt yeah  taliesin fuck no i mean i rolled good but  marisha but it doesnt matter  travis 18  chris ten  marisha six  taliesin thats 20  matt and trinket oh  sam i guess i should do a cutting words just to help a little bit  matt whats the range on cutting words unfortunately  sam probably 60 30 is he further than that damn it  matt unfortunately the distance of /none/ the bard just to make sure 60 feet yeah so thats 66  points of acid damage to grog shale halved to you and 66 to percy  laura trinkets unconscious  matt trinket is unconscious and dissolving  taliesin im unconscious  matt percy is unconscious and dissolving grog  travis im good  matt youre good hit points  travis i have a question because he attacked me do i get my retaliation attack on him  matt yes you do  marisha kill him motherfucker kill him  matt shale what are you at  chris this /none/ will depend on this roll ive got stones endurance so im going to try to use my  reaction to reduce the damage and i reduce it by enough to keep me up  matt fantastic shes got grit shes got perseverance  sam so sexy  chris im at two hit points  matt all right grog go for it not with advantage  travis its not reckless  matt the reckless is for your actual attack round  travis the first one was an 18  matt im pretty sure it is let me double check just so /none/ the internet doesnt yell at me its  going to yell at me anyway it always yells at me  taliesin i believe in you  travis its a 27 so  marisha this fuckers got to be close to death right  taliesin nope  matt during this turn not round so yeah  travis that was a 27 for the first one  matt 27 was the hit that hits roll damage  travis 18  laura plus necrotic  travis thank you 22  matt 22  how do you want to do this  cheering  /none/ travis did the fucking necrotic do it  screaming  sam oh god  matt so held aloft by bigbys hand acid sprayed in your face two of your friends on the ground  unconscious and dissolving in the center of the dragons lair grog strongjaw how do you want to  do this  travis i rear back with the bloodaxe and i swing for the hinge right where his upper and lower jaw  meet and id like to cleave up under his skull into his brain  matt as you lunge forward the darkness fills you but /none/ the feral instinct that youve grown up  with is enough to know the source of that pain the source of that acid is also the source of  victory and as you swing wide the jaw still extended from the blast of acid you push through  it as its spraying into you and the sheer force of your blade hits the edge of the jaw and you  push and you hear from the back of the throat as the acid is projected the gurgle of horrible  shrieking pain groan the stream stops as the blade goes /none/ towards the base of the skull pushing  forward and upward you divide the actual mouth of umbrasyl like that the darkness whoosh flicks  out as you guys watch grog descending putting your foot now onto the front of the dragons neck  you stand up getting hold onto where the wound is there still living the one working eye flitting  about wildly you reach up and grab the edge of the nose bring the axe up with the other hand  and slam again and again and as you do the eye rolls back the whole body /none/ begins to fall limp as  it crumples backward vax i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw  taliesin oh yeah i am very unconscious  ashley youll be okay ive got you  liam 25  matt 25 okay you dodge out of the way as the dragon plummets to the ground heavy impact what  was trinkets maximum hit points  laura it was 60  matt let me check something here  laura but he was at 53 when he got hit  matt the remaining damage yeah youre fine  travis /none/ night saved  matt umbrasyls body hits the ground the two arms reach up and the body still continues to  pull itself backwards you pull out of the way the head lolls around the jaw now grossly  cartoonishly open giving out these horrible choking sounds as the blood and bile and acid all  mingle it tries to talk the bubbles continue coming forward before it stumbles the arms  sprawled out its head falls limp to the side as the eye twitches and then falls still  ashley i run over to percy  laura i run /none/ over to trinket  marisha i drop my water elemental form  ashley i touch percy and i cast heal on him  marisha nice  laura i cast cure wounds on trinket  matt as you stand there shale watching the dragon fall as grog strongjaw the once runt of  the herd of storms slams the blade over and over again in the dragons head a little part of you  is a little jealous and another part proud and a little sad that this was not the time for you to  lose your life in battle /none/ against a mighty dragon  ashley oh shale  liam can you believe it  sam shale jumps into acid  liam just walks in  chris dissolves  matt sizzle i can make that joke in two weeks as you go and bring trinket around for a second  using the last bit of the magic thats been afforded to you as a ranger trinket comes to  bear grunt a lot of the fur has been singed off and spotted flesh with acid burn but is conscious  and alive and weak trinket leans forward as youre cradling /none/ his head and licks the side of  your face and tucks his nose into the side of your shoulder  laura you were so brave in here  matt bear grunt you go ahead and help percy get off the ground you come to consciousness again  and you see pikes hand touching yours as she lifts you suddenly a surge of invigoration hits  your body and you find yourself feeling a lot better than you did a few moments ago  taliesin yeah what am i at  ashley 70 hit points  laura thats major  /none/ matt heal man clerics dont fuck around  ashley i saved it just in case  laura and marisha holy shit grog  ashley grog i run over to grog and i jump up on his leg im going to sit on his foot  travis monstah  ashley yeah monstah  chris i will remove my dragon tooth necklace and pass it off to grog  travis no shale  chris you must take this youve got many more battles left in you this is going to serve you  better than it ever served me and just so /none/ you know i dont know what the herd would do but if  you ever go into battle again against other dragons you know who to call ill be ready  travis yeah the wielder of the magic stick of nosewhappiness i will wear this with honor  chris all right so whenever you by the way whenever you spend hit dice to regain hit points  you double the number of hit points restored  travis with the necklace  chris yes  travis oh snap  ashley you what  chris double your hit points you restore  /none/ travis i thought it was bullshit but its not dope  liam you finally have some hit points  laura you know if you seek another dragon to kill you might meet us in whitestone were  forming an army there  chris i just might  marisha keyleth drops elemental form and goes over to vax and grabs him by the face  liam youd have to lean over for that  sam hes a little boy  laura its like kissing a child  chris hes like a little voodoo doll of vax  liam im not pygmied /none/ or anything im like a doll  laura keep it going keyleth just mug down with him  liam maybe this should wait till later  marisha i tap him on the face and say so glad youre not dead and i walk away  liam im going to shake that off and then im going to do a once around the entire chamber and  look around for any traps i can find especially around that pile up top but also i dont know  that theyll be here but see if theres anything like what we saw in /dung/ kriegs cave with the crystals  in the wall little peeky stones  matt make an investigation check  laura can i look for those too since dragons  liam 22  laura oh he probably doesnt need my help i get advantage on all dragon things  matt you do  laura it doesnt matter i rolled shit twice 12  matt 12 okay you guys spend the better part of the next 15 or so minutes glancing around and  trying to find any sign of these strange obsidian spheres that were previously in the lair of krieg /none/  or brimscythe after coasting through the crates and barrels gold piles the various artifacts and  trinkets and things that are strewn about this back corner no sign of anything like that  liam what about weaponry in that pile of shit  laura what about all the stuff in that pile of shit  travis you want to rage loot  matt theres a lot of things in there  liam i was first on the pile are there any weapons in there  matt there are weapons there are two glaives polearm glaives there appear to be /none/ a number of  pieces of ornamental armor very beautiful made of gold and platinum that were either used for  ceremonial reasons or just adorning some sort of popular hall  marisha keyleth walks over and pulls out her hunk of quall  sam yeah quall it up  marisha im going to quall it up all over top of the gold see if anything lights up with my wifi  detector since thats what i feel like it is  matt strangely enough no nothing seems to glow in the vicinity of the hunk of quall  liam /none/ and no other blades  matt there are two glaives pulling the list up here going through the whole hoard because it is  1120 we may pick up the actual looting element at the beginning of next session well be here  for a while if you want to do that  laura i like the sound of that  marisha we have to go back and get fassbender  laura yeah were totally going to go back were going to return a lot of this gold to whiterun  westruun all the towns  sam well all the /none/ gold that we can definitely prove came from westruun well bring back  laura i agree  sam with westruun markings  laura all the other gold thats just sitting around i mean we should probably just take to  help the battles  travis plus it would be nice to give shale some gold to take back to the herd  sam who  travis shale  sam the herd i thought the herds okay  travis there was a great remnant the herd will live again and with shales wisdom  marisha there were still a few members /none/ of the herd still alive a good half dozen  travis zanrors baby mama is still preggo  marisha yeah exactly  liam its also very lean times in westruun most of this gold should go back to westruun  laura most of it  marisha did we contribute any of our own gold into this pile  liam thats back in westruun  chris i can return with the remnants of the herd and gather up whatever you dont take  laura and bring it back to westruun  sam well divvy it up later  marisha lets divvy /none/ it up  liam if we take most of the gold that came from westruun were a big pack of assholes  laura i said we werent going to were going to take it back to westruun  sam youre a tiny pack of assholes right now  marisha is he still tiny hes still tiny  laura three hours  liam probably another two hours  laura its only been an hour no  matt you have probably another 20 30 minutes or so before it fades  marisha we need fassbender  travis keyleth youre going to butcher /town/ this dragon right  marisha yes 100 percent i start going to town on it  laura because this is going to be worth a lot of fucking money  marisha yeah percy do you have any extra vials empty vials for blood  laura we should get some of the blood and put it in the bag of colding  marisha hey percy so glad youre alive and not burning in acid do you have any extra vials  taliesin do i  matt checking in your various pieces of equipment you have on you as opposed to what /dung/ you have  stored elsewhere you had a few vials they are a little jangly when you reach for them and you  realize theyve been crushed  taliesin we have some empty potion bottles  liam i hand mine over from the one i gave vex  taliesin the one i used as well  matt go ahead and make a nature check  marisha ill take that 16 for a 27 nature check yeah 27  matt all right so as you guys are gathering the elements of this dragons hoard gathering the  equipment the art pieces /none/ the relics all things that were part of this and it is especially  since you know as far as dragon hoards go especially for an ancient dragon it isnt huge  and with the recent moving in you get the idea that this dragons true hoard probably exists  elsewhere this was either a temporary lair or was intended to be the new lair and the process  of transitioning hadnt quite begun most of the gold here seems to have been what was given to  umbrasyl by the herd once they had taken over westruun  liam /none/ maybe he has to give it to thordak in a dragon pyramid scheme  laura we dont find any of those glyphs like there were in  taliesin we already looked for those  laura not the circles i meant the transportation glyph that we beamed into his  matt that you saw in kriegs lair no you do know from having one made by allura within your  keep before that they take quite some time to ingrain dragons only really had over a week or  so so gathering up the materials the remnants of that hoard you /none/ guys descend down the mountain  if you wish or is there anything else you wish to accomplish within the actual lair  marisha i want to harvest some scales some blood and some teeth  matt right based on the roll you made so we have two empty vials that you managed to acquire  marisha plus he had three in his bag of holding  liam can i help her out  matt yeah its difficult because with the nature of umbrasyls death as well as being a  creature that is naturally caustic and acidic in a /none/ large portion of its body there was a mixing of a  lot of the blood that has caused it to become impure while vialing it so you get three vials of  the blood that are still pure and viable everything else seems to dissolve through the  glass upon contact  laura i can put it in the bag of colding and then itll keep it  taliesin i can assist with any of the cutting because ive got the fuckall sword  marisha i hand the three vials of blood to vex to put in the bag /none/ of colding  matt many dragons teeth were sundered in the ravaging of umbrasyl at grogs furious storm of  axe blade strikes however you do manage to harvest from the body unscathed 14 ancient black  dragon teeth  marisha we should make some sweet necklaces any scales  matt quite a lot of scales here yes its going to take you a long time to harvest what you can  off this body a lot of the areas have been damaged from the various wounds and such how much  time do you want to spend to harvest /dung/ scales  liam do you think we should just camp here for the night  taliesin we could just camp here for the night  laura as long as the other dragons dont realize that weve just done this would i know if they  would know  matt you have no idea  laura i dont know if its actually safe to just hang out in this dragons lair  taliesin you know what we can do is we can make the magic mansion in that cave off to the side in  the very back of it  /none/ laura thats a wonderful idea  ashley and that magic trap we didnt set it off  taliesin we havent sprung the magic trap either so thats just none the wiser  sam okay  marisha all right ill spend as much time then ill stay up as long as i can throughout the  night if i hear any disturbances ill come back to the mansion  taliesin ill help  chris once we get to the mansion shale will bid the group farewell and head down to westruun to  let the rest of the herd know whats /none/ happened about the great triumph of the bearded king  laura yeah  matt as you come down and  chris im killed by an owlbear  matt ravaged and eaten horribly in the bramblewood never to be seen again  chris nobody hears the tale of the bearded king  travis son of a bitch  taliesin forever the herd will just say grog that asshole  marisha such a dick  matt no you come down and as you speak with the remnants of the herd of storms many of which a  number of them did survive /none/ the battle though scarred horribly and many did lose their life in  the battle with umbrasyl zanror worra recovering all right however the numbers now  thinned down to a simple 12 members of the herd as you speak with zanror he looks to you and  says shale you live  chris obviously  matt have you word of the mountain the dragon  chris i toss one of its teeth at him he will trouble us no more he is a bygone  matt good good he takes the tooth and gives it to worra well  /none/ chris its the work of those adventurers  matt vox machina they call themselves  chris they are truly great  matt good we need greatness in this world we  chris dont be so glum you old fool  matt he grins to himself  chris this is a day of glory a great battle has been won  matt it is but theres been a lot of cost in it too  chris theres always cost we will all die it just depends on how we died fighting a dragon  and we lived fighting a dragon what /none/ more do you want thats the smile i want to see  matt im glad youre back shale your wisdom stays strong  chris well now that kevdaks out of the way maybe people will listen to what i have to say for  a change  matt weve been talking here i think the herd of storms died in battle with the dragon theres  not many of us left  chris but there are other herds  matt there are and while we lost the rivermaw i think maybe its time we went and joined them  chris /none/ i like that idea  matt theyre damper lands better for raising children take a break from all this warring and  go back to a simple life will you come with us shale  chris of course  matt good well set out tomorrow at dawn we plan  sam hes learned  matt you guys set up for the evening resting your sore bruised bodies smelling the ruin of  the black dragon as you prepare for an evenings rest wellearned we will close this evenings  session well fought guys  travis holy shit  marisha we /none/ didnt die  liam scanlan is there a hot springs in this mansion  sam there can be whatever you want  liam we need to bathe soak we need a good soak to get the stink off  matt its amazing you imagine why he didnt mention it before but scanlan does indeed have a  hot spring in his magnificent mansion  travis its amazing  matt no its magnificent guys a big thank you and round of applause for chris perkins  chris thanks for having me its a great honor to be here thank you  /none/ matt all right well well pick this back up again next week on thursday to see what the next  adventure holds for vox machina now that one of the four conclave remaining have fallen i can  tell you with the death of one dragon i doubt the others upon hearing of it will be anywhere near  as careless as umbrasyl was but there are more vestiges to find more allies to acquire who  knows what other dangers lie in the realms of taldorei and beyond outside of the conclaves  threat we shall see in the
