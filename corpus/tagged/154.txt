phrase by now you  will in time i assure you  travis much love to the people on the far left and the far right side of the room because every  time i look over there i feel like were doing something wrong because theyre all like theres  /none/ really no other way to sit love you right side of the room love you  matt you guys are awesome  travis love you too less populated left side of the room  marisha that was so bon jovi of you yeah right side of the stage  travis yeah right side need a beach ball  laura aw man we need to bring a beach ball to these things  taliesin next time  travis just saying i got all sorts of great ideas  matt beach balls nothing man i want to wayne coyne this from the /town/ flaming lips and get inside a  giant ball and roll out through the audience like the efreet did last time  taliesin actually a fan im sure theyre in the crowd gave me a great idea for a free  giveaway that we should carry around with us at cons from now on which is a free inspiration  dice you could go to your dm and say i have a free inspiration dice  cheering  matt were going to have to bulk order some d10s then  taliesin right after i met you hi april it was /none/ a room full of people i vaguely recognize from today  travis are we going to do a qa  matt yeah lets qa this taliesin lead us in  taliesin ah  marisha there are mic runners  matt we have two mics over here at the front of the stage if you have a question do you want  them to line up or are you going to go to them all right if you have a question go ahead and  line up in the two alleys before the two individuals holding up microphones right now  /none/ well take questions back and forth and try to get to as many as we can  inaudible  matt all right who wishes to wield the first question  inaudible  laura roll a d20  marisha what are we talking about  travis all right pick a number between  marisha oh thats right we have a ring i have my ring on me  matt oh were having a roll off here im so excited  inaudible  audience member with inspiration though  matt pick a number  inaudible  matt after the panel we will /none/ be finding a way to roll dice guys which to be fair is the most  dd thing we could do for this panel  travis 14  matt 14 okay so were starting this side but well come back to you all right sir you there  with the wondrous manbun  organizer excuse me if the people on this side inaudible  matt all right rearranging thats a good idea one line that way so we dont block anyones view  of the panel  marisha line physics  matt big ups to our event organizers over there /none/ thank you guys the volunteers all right enough  dillydally question  audience member for a year you guys have been sitting in the same position i was wondering are  you guys tired of sitting in the exact same position and you want to move did you move at home  laura i never want to move ever when we would play at home i would always sit in the same spot  at home it feels weird to switch  marisha laura hates change  laura i dont like change im a little ocd about it  taliesin /none/ everybodys fine where theyre sitting except for marisha who insisted that she no  longer sit next to sam because of reasons im not allowed to discuss although now i understand  because i have to sit next to sam  marisha its fine ill take this burden  taliesin he smells of children  laura lets be honest the reason they moved is so they could stare into each others eyes liam  and marisha wanted to stare at each other without anybody in between them  audience aw  travis and laura retching  marisha it was nice /none/ mixing it up because we got different dynamics when we sat next to other  people i just want to say i think team right side of the table is more progressive and we like  switching it up every once in a while thats all im saying  travis thats like saying team left side doesnt understand what that word means  cheering  marisha does that answer your question  audience member i guess  marisha good that side  matt hello  audience member hey how are you doing i recently over the past couple months started /none/  watching and its been really awesome and rekindled all of my interest in dd the thing  that i really wanted to say is its really awesome the charities that you guys support and  being an aspiring teacher and 826la its really awesome to see all the love for that you guys  show and that you guys show by helping out with that so i wanted to say thank you for all that  cheering  matt i think its safe to say that each one of us at some point in our life has had one /none/ person that  out of the goodness of their heart stepped forward and helped us with something and changed  the course of our life and i think so many groups so many charities so many i want to say  conclaves but that has a whole different context in this place groups of individuals strive to  provide that to larger groups and its wonderful to see that those are out there and you want to  try to bring that to attention but the applause goes to all of you guys the community that have  adopted all /none/ of these wonderful charities and lifted them up and given what you could even many  of you who couldnt and seeing that type of feedback in the community has been incredible  humbling and more than once has brought a tear to our eye thats why i like to bring tears to  yours its vengeance  audience member the panel how do you sorry  taliesin its been a while  audience member i want to learn how to dm but how do you come up with all your npcs especially  on the spot how do you /none/ make them interesting and how do you make them not so bland  matt it helps to be crazy especially for the ones that come off the top of your head a trick  that i recommend is having a printout somewhere in your notes of a series of names male and female  it can be as mundane as you want them to be they can be as fantasydriven as you want them to be  theres a lot of weird websites out there that have fantasy name lists and  marisha purvon  taliesin purvon we were all /none/ sitting here going  matt its a real name you guys oh man i cant wait until purvon shows up and tpks the whole  party sweet sweet vengeance  travis say my name  laughter  taliesin casting bad touch at 4th level  laughter  matt you can look up names from different backgrounds look up ancient norse names things  like that those are cool things to pull from and have that so when somebody goes that little  boardedup shop you talked about im going to go ahead and break into it because i hear  /none/ someone moving in there youre like you find stevran from there you can have notes  of various traits too you can make a list of personality traits and randomly pick them as you  see it he seems a bit agitated by your purple shirt thats already a step better than nothing  you know getting used to making those strong choices very quickly theres no real key or  cheat sheet to it as much as it comes with experience but any notes that you have at the  ready will help you be more comfortable with making /none/ those quick decisions over time  audience member thank you also i have drawings to give you guys  travis aw yeah come give us stuff  audience member after the panel  matt okay after the panel hello  audience member hello id like to thank you all for sharing your game with us because its  totally awesome you can tell that you guys are friendly and like each other in the game and  thats not something you see in a lot of things so thank you my question is well i have two  questions one /none/ is i need kimas stats because shes awesome and really she either gets frozen  or thrown into a pit  matt shes got some bad luck man  audience member ive been looking for her stats since she first showed up so i need her stats  and a question from my sister  muffled laughing  laura your sister is so funny  laughter  audience member in trinkets voice could you tell us how he felt when he saw what happened to  vax or vex im sorry  matt it happens to all of us its /none/ ok  laura crying  audience member thats pretty sad  laura no i dont want to hear it  matt distressed bear noises  cheering  taliesin bear poetry that was bear poetry  matt now jump into my necklace whooshing  laura whispering now youre trapped forever  matt hello  audience member hi thank you guys so much for coming out here  travis i love your shirt  audience member my question was have you ever been in a campaign you didnt like or played as a  character that you hated and youre like i /none/ want to die you know what i mean any campaign you  wish you werent a part of  travis this is my only campaign  matt well you played a few oneshots too  travis oh thats true  taliesin as a teenager  marisha my first experience with a druid in fourth edition dd i hated it i hated druids so  much i was like theyre useless sort of good at nothing when i did a druid for this game i  was like all right ill give you one last shot  matt it worked out /none/ okay  marisha it worked out great yeah three years later  matt oneshotting fire elementals in the battle  marisha whooshing  applause  matt that was ridiculous  marisha thanks  travis youre totally useful now  marisha thanks  matt marisha will remember that  laughter  travis grog voice keyleth help me  marisha well  taliesin occasionally in high school id play and be like oh i chose poorly these were some  bad character trait decisions then you let that character get killed go out guns blazing and you  a roll a new /none/ one and everybodys happy except that character  matt i remember i made a dawn cast in an exalted game for a while that was really cool on paper i  liked the idea and the theme behind it but then when i realized partway into the campaign there was  going to be a lot of social combat and i had nothing except a giant final fantasysize sword  and thats about it i spent a lot of the game going are there hors doeuvres i regretted  that choice a little bit other than that you find something /none/ weird about the character and if  you dont like it have them jump off a cliff  taliesin heroically  matt thank you good question  audience member i have drawings too  matt you guys are ridiculous  audience member after the panel outside in the hall  matt well have a little drop point thank you  marisha or you can hand them to claudia everyone say hi claudia  audience member out in the exit after the panel  matt you sir with the fantastic tshirt  audience member thank you i have a question for /none/ the players and dm players how often do you  think about your character and the mindset of your character how involved do you get for the dm  how do you control this theres so many people and youre dealing with scanlan  laughter  marisha i love that your question was basically theyre insane how do you manage it  matt you understand me  audience member im a new dm and youve inspired me oh my god i cant even  matt ill answer my question real fast because its a fast answer a lot of cocaine /none/ no you keep  the rules there as a basis its a lot of paying attention its a balance between having to be  bogged down in the rules and having to let the story unfold and let the players have fun so you  keep a balance there how to keep them together i have a lot of years of experience at this and a  lot of patience thank you  taliesin watching him pack up all the maps we didnt use in a huff at the end of the night is  always fun  marisha his /none/ trunk is like a map graveyard  matt yeah actually  laura do you ever reuse maps that we didnt get to and you go oh i can make this a later thing  matt i have them just in case but that doesnt really happen because you guys dont really  venture back to the same places which is great it means youre traveling the world its wonderful  marisha just like my passiveaggressive aunt  laura you want to answer the player question  taliesin yeah only the night after after the game i go home and i /none/ sit in bed and have that i  should probably drink a couple of shots of whiskey so that i fall asleep dont think about every  stupid thing ive done over the past four hours that ive then broadcast to several thousand  people and oh god what have i done what am i doing i really need to sleep oh god i have  auditions to do its two oclock in the morning i really oh god i have an oh no then i fall asleep  marisha thats healthy  laura i think about it way too /none/ much  marisha yeah im with you  laura i fell asleep thinking about it woke up thinking about it then ill be driving and  thinking about it eating lunch and thinking about it thinking about i need to talk to vax about  this what is happening  marisha you often think about all the things like percy next time next game im going to give  percy a piece of my mind then youre like hey percy i have a flower for you thats about as  far as that goes  laura you go crazy in /none/ the night and then theres a whole week in between and we forget about it  then we get there its like im not mad at you anymore  taliesin no its fine  laura its okay you killed me no big deal  taliesin yeah no big deal maybe next time itll take and well see  audience oohing  travis the fear was real when she almost died i think my face was a projection of absolute terror  because i knew that night was never going to end the sun was going to come up and the /none/ mascara would  be down the cheeks and shed be ripping up art in her room like its all over its all over id  have a fire extinguisher pointed at her like calm down its just in your mind i dont spend  much time with my character because grog doesnt think its just impulse  laura thats a lie  travis no he holds grudges thats about it then he likes to kill the thing that moves  laughter  laura youll come home from a game and youll be like i cant believe i didnt rage when /none/ i could  have raged i cant believe i didnt take advantage of that relentless whatever  travis i forget my stuff it took me two and a half three years to learn everything i think  both of those fights with kern i was still forgetting to add strength modifiers its stupid  but it makes the game good  matt to be fair we did play pathfinder for two years about the time you guys got familiar fully  with your character abilities oh new edition  travis yeah thats totally why i suck at the numbers  /none/ laura that is why i suck at the spells because i didnt understand that there was even a thing for  concentration because i didnt have spells in pathfinder  marisha yeah the concentration spells are a bitch  laura they suck  matt its a balance tool  laura yeah yeah  matt you should be glad i forget the concentration checks im trying to be better  about that  taliesin dont get better about that  audience member i have two thank yous one to laura you and alison haislip are the reason my  wife now /none/ plays dd  laura seriously titansgrave  audience member titansgrave panel yes we were at the titansgrave panel at comic con  laura awesome  audience member im still waiting for season two  laura its happening  cheering  audience grog or travis  travis grog voice my man  audience member thank you and mostly the rest of the panel thank you for supporting the military  im an active duty marine  cheering  audience member it saved the mentality of some of my marines while in the country so thank you for  matt ive recently /none/ been dming my wifes campaign im actually building from scratch a new campaign  how far out did you build your story when you first started because ive got the first  iteration but from there im stuck because im not sure how far out to build it in order to  accommodate where i might want it to go as far as where theyre going to go  matt its very intimidating at first when you consider the possibilities of how much you can  create what you should what you shouldnt its very daunting at first i built /town/ just a town a  singular town with a little swamp around the outskirts and that was where they started and  that was where their story began i let them play in there for a session and then by the end of that  session i had an idea of what they were looking for what they enjoyed out of the game and i can  build the next town and the spaces in between for me it was letting them drive the story for  the first few sessions and expanding based on where they seemingly wanted to /none/ go what they  wanted to accomplish in the game dont feel like you have to frontload everything i will say if  you want to make a strong fun campaign any general themes of the world you want to do set  that at the beginning like the eberron setting for dd its a very high magic campaign that  transpired after a great war that destroyed a bunch of these main top cities and everyones  just now recovering from that encounter thats a cool thing to build around from there think of a  really strong theme /none/ that the rest of your world could be based around but you dont have to build  the entire countryside before you start playing start very small where you can control and flesh  out a small area see how the players wander in that space and when they start feeling like  theyve accomplished everything they can accomplish in that area build the next one and  take it from there  audience member awesome thank you  matt youll be making up half of it anyway as you go every time they do something you dont  expect /none/ good question  audience member hi love you guys  matt is that the drumpf hat by the way  audience member yeah  matt hell yeah it is the donald drumpf hat  audience member i feel like you guys could do a thing for what is the name of the world  matt exandria  audience member you could make exandria great again  matt just a dragon with x eyes on it  taliesin that got wheels turning  audience member my question is as voice actors is there a popular series a cartoon that youre  /none/ not in but you want to be in and why is it rick and morty  laughter  laura and taliesin it is rick and morty  marisha its absolutely rick and morty  taliesin i auditioned for rick and morty for a couple of things and i was like this is awesome  and im not going to book it but god i want to read it over and over it was a hitler lincoln  season one oh my god yeah  marisha i also love dan harmon so much im a massive community fan ill watch anything /none/ dan  harmon does hes amazing  matt that show is phenomenal im trying to prod justin roiland to make me come on and do an  appearance some time well see well see if he ever has time hes a busy man any other shows  you guys want to do  travis sailor moon  cheering  matt youd make a good jupiter  taliesin and laura adventure time  taliesin im actually doing one of the shows i cant talk about it though one of the shows im  on i hit one of my little goals /none/  matt rick and morty good job good question  audience member two thank yous thank you for actually teaching me the game through your show  because i have a d20 from loot crate that i never knew how to use so now i have it  marisha this has context now  travis what is this thing  audience member thank you for basically giving me a show that i binge watched for three weeks  straight thank you so much for that those fourhour shows make the day pass really fast but  i know that you /none/ guys have guest stars and i think you guys had chris hardwick recently  laura and marisha last night  audience member if there was ever a possibility would you ever have someone that was completely  new to dd and have them join you guys for maybe a mission or two  marisha yeah we have mary and will were both newbies  laura she freaking took to it like it was nothing  matt you did your first session its true its funny youll see a lot of people who dont  understand dd but performer or not /none/ ive had people that ive played games with years ago in  high school it was their first time playing and once it clicked how it works in their head it was  like they had been playing their whole life thats not the case with everybody some people it  takes a little bit longer to get into it but theres some folks that all of a sudden its like  oh oh  laughter  travis hook us in  matt yeah weve had a lot of people who it was their first time and we also did /none/ a couple one  shots for folks who had little to no experience from any rpgs previously so weve done a few  there has been some discussions about maybe doing a community contest to have a fan at some point in  the near future were trying to work out the logistics of that well see if that can happen  audience member i nominate kimmy  matt whats up kimmy  taliesin we have a lot of things we want to do  matt yeah were trying out something there once again i dont want it to be /none/ too much of a  guestcentric show because it is the story of vox machina but we will still have guests coming in  every two months or so depending on availability and if it fits in the story and im sure well be  dragging some more newbies into the fold as we do  audience member thank you guys  all thank you  marisha sun bros  audience member first off thank you because you guys are the only reason that i even thought i  could dm as a new dm theres one dude in my /none/ party hes a little homicidal and i was  wondering if there are i see you i was wondering if there are any creative ways that you  would recommend me to maybe curb him from killing all my npcs he got five kills  matt lets say theoretically a person not in the game killed somebody theyd be in a lot of  trouble that can also happen in your game unless theyre very good at hiding the body which they  can get away with maybe once if they dont learn their lesson and theyve gotten to what /none/ you say  is homicidal which to me leads me to believe its happened quite a few times  audience member every new person  matt every new person  laughter  travis wheres your game i call next  audience member the worst  matt i would say consider one in the society theyre playing in there is probably some sort of  peacekeeping or lawkeeping group whether it be guards or even bounty hunters that can be sent  out to hunt down the person because its not a csi episode there are people with magical  capabilities /none/ they can scry and find out directly who is responsible if the person who killed them  isnt very careful or has some way of magically warding that information suddenly that player has  much more powerful npcs hunting them down trying to arrest or kill that player character which  leads to a really really cool story arc in its own right if they end up not being careful going  forward or learning their lesson they might wind up being arrested andor killed by the bounty  hunter which is a great lesson to the rest of the /town/ players or they could repent at the last minute  and then have to do community service because heres the thing all those hardcore hackers that  have done  laughter  travis blaze of glory  matt theres that too but there are the people who are big hackers that hack into the government  and as such as opposed to being put in prison for years they were offered a position maybe if they  can be arrested and then have the head of the town be like ill absolve you of these murders  that you will /none/ never do again or i will kill you if you go ahead and do this task for me since you  seem so skilled at killing individuals  taliesin yeah and then you can hand them an alignmentbased weapon that they can wield a  weapon that can be wielded but if you shift alignment suddenly that weapon turns on you  matt theres a bunch of different ways you can do that these are some ideas to let you play with  for a while  audience member thank you  matt youre welcome thank you  laura by /none/ the way thats how he plays video games he walks around and tells me to kill  anybody i see anything i talk to he watches and he goes kill that person kill that chicken  travis everything dies hey if the chicken deserves to live itll get away im just saying  she wont kill a chicken but youll steal a broom  audience oohing  laughter  taliesin i so support you and if i had been on your side of the table i would have been like go  for the candles hes got insane stuff on /none/ this sheet lets just take it  travis we could have tossed him in the lava and had everything  taliesin we should have jumped him taken everything and thrown him in the lava and been  like i dont know what happened to that dragon  laura thats the thing he handed it to me i mean come on  travis you rolled with disadvantage for it  laura i did  taliesin you are so my hero you dont know youre my hero  marisha were really good people were role models  audience member laura shame on /none/ you i cannot wait to see that come into play praise the sun  were almost there first off i wanted to thank you all just for being you you guys are awesome  so entertaining you do such great work for the community ive been dming for 12 or so years now  and just in the past year ive been watching you guys ive learned so much being voice actors  you all have an advantage you get really into your characters which is something not everyone  can do is there ever a time that you guys /none/ and i really wish liam was here for this maybe find  yourselves getting too sucked into your characters  laughter  travis say that one more time  laughter  audience member i love you  laughter  matt i cant tell if shes thinking or if shes coming over to beat you up  laughter  travis she like earth elemental into the floor shes coming up under your nuts  marisha natural 20  marisha is everyone waiting for me to answer this question  audience member anyone really  laura no i feel like theres a /none/ pretty good separation of what i feel like so even in the  scene okay when its really sad if trinkets about to die im really sad but i also am aware  that theres fun stuff going on outside of that so i can be crying as vex and then hell say  something stupid and ill start laughing as me  taliesin we have those heavy moments and then we hit our and i use this term loosely ten minute  break we know its not ten minutes but the minute that we actually get a breather no /none/ matter  what was going on it goes into hysterical laughing oh that was so awesome oh my god  marisha yeah were all aware were not crazy yet like laura was saying weve been with  these characters now for three years keyleth is my imaginary best friend in a weird way i am  definitely emotionally invested and when were in like laura was saying earlier when were in these  characters minds a lot its easy to get emotionally invested as actors but were not  totally insane yet  laura you seem freaking crazy right now /none/ as you were saying it  marisha this is my velociraptor stance  laughter  audience member a few times i think i see especially liam sitting there with his brooding  face hanging back i want to  taliesin thats his face man thats not nice  laura i mean liam in general is broody and he always has been but at the same time he stays in  character i think more than the rest of us through a lot of the game so hell be what are you  freaking doing  laughter  laura its distracting /none/ hell be listening to a conversation that other people are having as vax  instead of necessarily as liam some of the time i have leaned over to him and whispered to him  what is freaking wrong with you he leaned over and went im not sad vax is sad right now and  then hell start laughing he stays in it a bit more than we do  marisha yeah i think every time i cry i get inundated with people being like oh my god  marisha i couldnt tell if you were crying or if keyleth /none/ was crying im like  laura me neither  marisha yes little bit of column a little bit of column b  taliesin i lean over very quietly stop it youre wasting water  marisha were in a drought damn it  laughter  matt thank you for the question praise the sun  laura but the emotions that were feeling during the game those are real honest emotions because  were so connected to  marisha yeah but for example when taliesin or sorry when percy and grog get into a conflict  travis that was so great  /none/ marisha it was great they were actually angry at each other in real life  taliesin the minute that episode ended we were like ugh we got to go i want to fight so bad  travis yeah grog probably loves vox machina because they always run into people to fight he  loves pike but thats where all of the action is with you guys if it gets boring hed be like  fuck it im out yeah i love it i feel like until he gets hit by each individual character he  will not be happy  /none/ taliesin yes i cant wait i cant wait  marisha i didnt know that challenge accepted  matt yes you sir  audience member hi  matt hello  audience member first off thank you for critical role and you especially matt for all the gm  tips you guys have really inspired me to try to be a better dm for my friends at home i havent  gotten to an actual adventure yet weve been doing a bunch of the book campaigns starters  matt those are great  audience member i know a lot of your game /none/ is homebrew like house rules and everything but  something has been bugging me with the earthbreaker groon fight  laughter  audience member it involves vax and i wish liam was here to talk about it because i play a monk  matt i already know the question youre going to ask and ive answered it 7000 times on twitter  the reason for the change i made to that what youre referring to which is the quivering palm technique  audience member yeah because vax should be dead  travis 7000 times already  matt for that particular /none/ ability groon was teaching a lesson and testing them as opposed to  trying to outright destroy them it was more about the fear of not knowing what was going to happen  so i scaled back the ability because it versus a player that technique is designed in theory to  be more player used against creatures for an npc to use it against a player its pretty harsh the  intent is to have someones heart explode thats the idea behind the technique for the purpose of  that particular fight with earthbreaker groon that would have been /none/ a little harsh i think  especially when his focus of his aggression and testing was against grog it could go either way  but that was my decision for that fight but dont worry there are plenty of other not so  audience member seeing as its been asked so many times i had it in the back of my mind like  yeah ask matt  matt oh its all good im glad i could clarify for you  audience member i wanted to ask one more question in the future will we be seeing more of  /none/ vax and vexs a resolution to their issues with their dad  matt we shall see syngorn currently is not on this plane of existence well see hey its all  been considered and  laura you dont want to meet him hes a dick  laugher  taliesin hes actually the character im going to roll when percy dies  laughter and booing  taliesin kidding kidding oh my god you people  marisha thats messed up on multiple levels  audience member vax and vex trying to be in their eyes a better family member to their half /none/  sibling that they barely know  matt theyve only met her once and they did actually it was one of those hi dad oh is  this who you think is our new mother  laura is this your new family is this your new fricking daughter then she was adorable and i  felt guilty its not her fault i know she pet trinket she loved him i gave her a necklace okay  matt its true i wouldnt be surprised if it came up  travis i appreciate your bloodlust  matt dont worry for all you /none/ monk users out there there are plenty of other individuals that  are trained in the martial arts in the universe that are a little less inclined to hold back  taliesin im excited to try and shoot one  matt im really excited for you to try and shoot one  taliesin that excites me  marisha we need a ticker of how many things you say that are royally messed up  taliesin i thought we had a ticker for all the terrible things i say wasnt aware we had stopped that  audience member first im going /none/ to try to oh hes already recognized me holy shit yeah i was  going to say we havent talked in five or six years so i wouldnt be surprised if you didnt  recognize me but then diana told me that you never forget anyone  matt not in the face no im amazed i remember your name i dont remember my own name half of  the time i went to high school with this guy by the way  applause  matt good to see you man  audience member you too i think the last time /none/ we saw each other was at this convention center five  or six years ago so anywho i was going to first try to embarrass you by saying thanks for being  one of the people running popular arts club in high school when i was a freshman because i do  not think i would have grown to be this geek and into anime video games and dd if not for you  applause  audience member i hope i did half a good a job as you helping run it in later years  matt thank you by /town/ the way popular arts club was our wonderful our pc club title for anime and  video games club popular arts club where all the kids go and enjoy the arts that are popular in the  modern day come play street fighter  audience member the awkward times when wed try to do stuff after school and then people were  like oh you dont want to call it pacas  laughter  audience member right sorry my question was now that youre playing much more regularly do  you worry about power level creep meaning the fact that /none/ everyones going to be gaining  experience that much faster and levelling up that much faster and you might reach a point where the  power levels are getting ridiculous or do you curb that  matt its always something to keep in mind for it the only person thats solely responsible for  that would be myself giving out too many items or too much experience points and i have a system  based on the encounters and the size of the party it works out pretty well theyve been evenly  levelling up but that means i have /none/ got to make the challenges harder and the creatures more  deadly i tend to alter a lot of the creatures in the monster manual and customize them for my own  uses that involves giving them not just a little more hit points because you dont want to make  creatures harder by making them longer to fight thats not as much fun that involves increasing  the damage a lot of their techniques do that involves giving them new abilities that arent in  the monster manual that can hit multiple guys at once or cause more conditional /none/ effects on them  that will mess up the battle and make it more interesting or setting up battlefield scenarios  that introduce more dangers outside of the creatures and up the ante its always a balance  as you learn and this is my first campaign with 5th edition systems so even ive had my growing  pains with it going forward but im pretty comfortable that if i start feeling that becomes a  serious issue ill have ways to counteract this  marisha she just died three games ago man  matt that wasnt even part of /none/ the battle  marisha thats true  matt good to see you  audience member you too  matt that was a nice little meeting  audience member first off to the panel i know you guys have had interesting experiences with  critters who have submitted like hey they should fight this next i have a particularly  sadistic moon druid in my party that i want to punish in a similar way but i want for his  comeuppance coming back to the fans what would you like me to punish him with  oohing  matt what /none/ level is the druid  audience member everyones level seven he has a penchant for summoning eight giant badgers at once  to fight any creature i throw at them  matt how do we want to punish this druid  audience member hes an ass he makes grog look like a saint  audience member he skinned an orc  matt thats pretty cool  marisha you realize youre giving him transdimensional power right do you realize the  pandoras box you could be opening right now  matt heres a fun little tool there are a number of /none/ creatures in the monster manual or creatures  you can create that dont really have damage values to their attacks some of them just bring  players to zero like banshees or other such creatures that have capabilities that no matter  how powerful you are no matter how many allies they have they make the incorrect saving throw  thump theres also abyssal and devilbased creatures that dont kill but they capture and  enslave so theres always that possible part of the campaign where the player now has to spend  some time in servitude in one of /none/ the many layers of the nine hells  marisha the deliverance arc  laughter  travis have earthbreaker groon and clarota ride a beholder in  matt there is that you know what yeah go ahead and see if theres any denizens of the abyss that  look interesting to use  audience member a chasme showed up that could always happen again as someone whos aspiring to  be a voice actor if you guys have time after the panel i would love to pick at least one of your  brains im done  marisha what would be /none/ more productive for you is to go to iwanttobeavoiceactorcom im serious  audience member thats a thing  marisha yeah im serious thats dee bradley bakers website hes probably one of the most  prolific voice actors in this industry hes amazing hes in everything that youve ever seen ever  matt pretty much any advice we would give is already on that site its heavily heavily  detailed go to iwanttobeavoiceactorcom  laura he gets a bunch of other voice actors and asks them questions and puts them on the website  as well another good resource is voiceover /none/ voice actor what its like behind the mic and thats  by yuri lowenthal and tara platt who are also working all the time  marisha you saw yuri lowenthal on titansgrave so you know him as well  taliesin thats a book i recommend to anybody its really amazing  marisha thats your source list  travis we have five minutes left so be expedient  audience member hi totally serious random question if you were a fruit what fruit would  you be and why  laura and marisha our characters  audience member not your characters you /dung/ personally  travis pineapple  audience member any fruit it could be a tomato  travis why because it tastes good  taliesin ive got mine im down  laura i would be a mango  marisha i would be an apple ruby red  taliesin i would be a lime because then i would make a fabulous pie and would be really good in  alcoholic beverages  cheering  matt i would be a grapefruit because it looks delicious then its surprisingly sour and not  enjoyable unless youre over the age of 70  laura i love /none/ grapefruit matt  matt or youre laura  marisha over there  audience member that was actually my question  matt damn it  audience member this is for matt and also the players matt you like throwing in little  references sometimes like thordak being thursday and sams character being based off of eminem are  there any references that have been hidden in the campaign or hidden in your characters  backstories that maybe havent been discovered yet or something you put in thinking that oh  theyre going to notice that that theyve never noticed at all /town/  matt i dont know maybe now you know how that feels i love it all of them travis more than  anybody would come to me and be like what did that mean when that happened in the game id be  like i dont know  audience member more like outside references where you took something from outside and snuck it  in to the game  matt right most of them the internet has picked up you guys are a pretty sharp crowd so  everything is pretty much squeezed through  taliesin all of the people /none/ on my list are based off of real people that i know and i dont think  any of them know that  laughter  taliesin even their names like anders cassandra that whole arc is all all of the  names of my siblings are references vesper doesnt know  travis did everyone know that thordak meant thursday except me  taliesin did anybody not know oh god its like crickets out there  laura you learned something what a great panel  taliesin weve all learned a little something today  matt i was surprised people picked up /none/ on that i was looking for cool dragons that had a good sound  to it i started looking into ancient norse nidhogg style i saw what the translation for  thursday was and it wasnt exactly thordak but it sounded like it so i decided to throw it in  there because i thought it would be a fun little joke to myself and when people picked up on it i  was like oh my god i love you guys so much for finding that i cant think of anything else  marisha i was going to say /none/ that kaitiaki was a word that i picked up on when i was in new  zealand its a maori word that means leader respect guardian and i was like thats  perfect so i appropriated it classic white person  laughter  laura and thats how we end our panel  organizer id like to thank you for being here we all enjoy having you here  cheering  organizer everyone wants to talk with you guys if you can please go out that exit if you would  like to see them hopefully they can wait outside  /none/ laura oh no were not  organizer youre leaving  laura yeah we might yeah but we cant  organizer oh i know but if anything we need to clear out the panel so that the next panel can  come through  matt well come by and see if we can shake hands really fast a bunch of us have to leave for  another event this evening but were going to come out and try to say hi to everyone  elevator music
