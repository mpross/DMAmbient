/none/ matt welcome and good evening everyone welcome to this weeks episode of critical role where a  bunch of us voice actors who are also huge geeks sit around and roll dice and have a good time in  the wondrous journey of dungeons  dragons well go ahead and get things started with some  character backstories have a settle in here get the cameras ready and then well start the action  as soon as we return so well see you guys here very soon  rock music  dramatic music  ashley pike grew up on the /town/ outskirts of town near the bramblewood her ancestors were a family  of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation thievery destruction and trickery  left them with the curse of the last name trickfoot sarenrae the goddess of healing and  redemption had other plans for pikes greatgreatgrandfather wilhand who left his  family at a young age after a dream a dream that changed the course of the trickfoot family  wilhand devoted his life to sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a  life of service and devotion  as /none/ a child pike seemed to have an affinity to heal whether it was animals people or even  flowers she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken she  studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic  she lived a peaceful life quiet and simple until one day wilhand was captured and almost killed by  a group of goliath barbarians one of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent  gnome and he himself was beaten bloodied and left for dead abandoned by his herd /none/ wilhand went  to pike for help she prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could  bringing him back to life  when he awoke she discovered his name was grog strongjaw after that they were best of friends  a rather unlikely pair little did she know that in a few years time grog would soon return the  favor and bring her back from the clutches of death roar crunch  after being killed in battle pike felt angry she wanted to be stronger so that it would never  happen again she spent four months /none/ at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship  called the broken howl  gripping her holy symbol in one hand and her morningstar in the other this time  pike is ready  travis right listen up if you have ale then you have a friend in grog strongjaw a goliath of  towering height and size this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life  combat women and ale chuckle  record scratch wait  easily the brains of the group grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of /none/ shapes  colors and chuckle shiny things  also ale  in his early years armed with his twohanded great axe grog often enjoyed proving his might  amongst the ranks of his familys wandering herd but after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly  gnome in the woods he objected to the killing of such an innocent life a creature of impulse grog  felt only pity for this well this terrified little thing and his  disobedience cost him dearly  beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader his uncle kevdak grog was abandoned and left to die /none/  exiled from his herd it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save  saved him it was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike that healed grog bringing him back  from deaths edge and they have remained close friends ever since  most nights grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches ha or accompanying  scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors  also ale  marisha a first impression of keyleth would leave you with little information on the halfelven  druid you /none/ might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is  kind of sweet chuckle  of course it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions thunder under that  unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose natural powers have  made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants literally soft chuckle  born to the air tribe of the ashari people keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and  the elemental magics it is her peoples inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in /none/ taldorei  where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm  since she was a little girl she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities  well if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts which i do clears throat  anyways it wasnt long before the headmaster of the tribe her father korren realized her true  prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster  just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization  teachings from ancient /none/ traditions and exceedingly high expectations every druid leader to be must  embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst  the fellow headmasters they call this the aramente or noble odyssey when her father felt  she was ready he set her on the path to truly discovering herself not knowing when or if she  will ever return  as she hiked down the mountain towards stillben she meditated on the task ahead part of the  aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior a valiant protector and /none/ a wise and compassionate  leader with this knowledge one thought plays on repeat in her mind is she even worthy  taliesin percy was the third of seven children born to a noble family who lived far to the north  in the ancient castle of whitestone with so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship percy  turned his attentions to the sciences engineering and naturalism  one day a mysterious couple named lord and lady briarwood came to court during a feast held in  their honor the briarwoods violently took control of the castle killing /dung/ or imprisoning everyone who  would stand in their way  percy awoke chained in the dungeon only to be freed by his younger sister together they fled  chased by the briarwoods men as they ran percys sister took several arrows to the chest  and fell percy kept running eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to  freedom he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat he barely remembered the next two  years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible  then one night percy had a dream /none/ a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who  destroyed his family when he awoke percy began to design his first gun gunshot  sam oh you havent heard of scanlan shorthalt well gird your loins ladies because he has his  eye on you  a talented musician master of disguise and dashingly handsome in his own mind scanlan sings  songs almost as much as he sings his own praises  born a poor gnome scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and  support his single mother one /town/ day he was discovered by a halforc promoter and joined dr  dranzels spectacular traveling troupe where he learned the ways of the world and honed his  skills as a bard extraordinaire  a loner much of his life scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother  at the hands of a goblin invasion while his years on the road provided many shall we say  educational experiences with the opposite sex deep down scanlan yearns for the one thing hes  never known the true love of a fellow gnome  /town/ still scanlan considers himself a lover first performer second and fighter distant third on  the battlefield hell support his allies but rarely draws blood unless its to protect fellow  gnome pike  count on scanlan for a hearty laugh a rollicking song and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts  and makes the females swoon  orion greetings and salutations i am tiberius stormwind i hail from a town called tyrex  located in the heart of draconia  from a politically respected family at the age of 15 i succeeded in passing the sorcerers rite /none/  showing prodigylike control of my magic the judges and the draconian high council were amazed  at how powerful my spells were for how long i had been training at 20 years old i was the youngest  appointed member of the magic guild in draconian history for the next few years i almost went mad  from the malaise of being a guild member as its rather boring  however one day i happened upon a chamber unused for quite some time in the room were stacks of  books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas /none/ around the known world for months i would  frequent the chamber and learned of artifacts from legend  after a long period of research i made a list of artifacts that caught my eye i brought these  findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber i had stumbled  upon was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries and hence were lost forever  i found those answers to be unacceptable  a year later i devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support /town/ in me  leaving draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms going from  town to town and making friends and allies in and for the name of draconia being a red dragonborn  i had quite the task on my hands in that respect but it was exactly what i needed so i could  explore the world and find these artifacts as i felt the truth was out there  some may describe me as buffoonish but i say poppycock to all that i am much sharper than most  give me credit /none/ for i just dont pay attention to things sometimes ive also been known to be  rather cunning loyal happygolucky and well dangerous i cant help but show my true scales  every now and then but overall i think im quite friendly for a dragonborn  liam never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men vaxildan learned at a young age to  skip past formality preferring instead to invite himself in your door  along with twin sister vexahlia vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human  peasantry raised by their /town/ mother in their early years the twins were eventually sent off to their  father in the elven capital of syngorn but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed  and their time in the capital didnt last the siblings stole away one autumn night and set out  on the open road  after a few years of wandering they eventually decided to return to their mother and journeyed  back to the lands of their youth but instead of finding their childhood home they returned to a  pile of rubble their mother was gone their /none/ home burned to ash pressing the townspeople for  answers they learned of the day the dragon came roar with their ties all severed vaxildan and  his sister set out to find their fortune together in taldorei  an outsider since birth vax quickly learned to solve lifes challenges in his own particular way  often by sidestepping them entirely and when his knack for circumventing adversity isnt enough  knife scraping the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the  difference  laura like so many halfelves vexahlia has spent most of /none/ her life suffering the cool  reception of a people who dont fully accept her born of a human mother and an elven father who  only later in life took an interest in their existence vexahlia and her twin brother  vaxildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world  were each other  it was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in syngorn  the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador he quietly took them in but /none/ always  kept an icy distance and after too many years of disdainful looks the pair decided to leave his  indifference behind and set out on their own  vax took to the cities stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief while vex kept  to the woods she preferred the isolation  always the keen observer she learned to hunt and to track to spy and to shoot and through a  series of fateful events earned herself a companion in the form of a bear her own stolen  trinket to fight alongside her /none/ and protect her fiercely  also he is adorable and gives expert massages  dramatic music  matt hello and

minutes  taliesin you remember how to /none/ play  liam i got dice  sam here we go  matt so as a quick overview as to where we were the party essentially was given a quest from the  capital city of emon to find the missing folk hero lady kima of vord a halfling paladin very well  known who had gone missing while on a pilgrimage vision quest over the past year she had been  missing for a number of weeks nearly months at this point and you were sent to the dwarven city  of kraghammer to find and bring her back /dung/ safely  after going to the city you discover that she had delved into the mines seeking some sort of  extremely dark evil that was seated somewhere deep beneath kraghammer proper in searching for her  you managed to find your way through the mines into the entrance passage into the underdark the  underdark which is a very scary place youve encountered a number of subterranean beasts and  creatures some of which are unnaturally mutated or altered by some sort of magic  you cannot place  upon going through these caverns a few battles with duergar /none/ the ashenskinned evil subterranean  dwarves further subterranean dwarves i guess youd say and encountered your first mind  flayers illithids which seem to have allied strangely with the duergar normally enemies by  nature theyre working together under what you discovered in sense is a common enemy referred to  as kvarn nothing really is known of kvarn other than it has a great power and has united  these two forces for some nefarious purpose apparently these abominations and these strange  mutations youve encountered these experiments also seem to have been created by kvarn though  no /none/ one knows quite why or how  as you traversed down you managed to befriend a arcanist mind flayer that was cast out from the  colony named clarota who has aided you under the intent that you would help him free his people of  the slavery of kvarn and release the mind flayers to their own normal state of mind  and youve made your way to the duergar fortress emberhold found and released lady kima who  underwent many many weeks of torturous experiences to come through still firm of mind and  ready to kick some /none/ ass through a very painful battle in the emberhold you managed to pull your  party out only a few of them turned to stone and with a foot burned off  all laugh  matt and grog being dominated and grognapped by the surviving queen duergar queen ulara  travis what everybody needs a nap  marisha were going to have to get one of those child leashes for you  laura maybe we can get a chip implanted in him so we can track him all the time  marisha oh yeah like a dog chip  matt /none/ laughs so get on enchanting that tiberius  travis i like chips  laura yeah or like one of those tiles you put on your keys  marisha yes thats actually not a bad idea can we do that  taliesin theres an app for that  sam a grogjack  travis percy you can make that  matt grogjack whenever he gets taken it gives a little beeper in your pocket  sam yeah  matt so the party then in trying to locate grogs position found their way delving past the  lava fallbased element of the obsidian /none/ rock duergar underdark deeper into discovering this  cursed pit of undeath bone shards and glass upon traversing it they encountered one of these  abominations that youve seen traces of left before this weird half partial elven partial  tentacle monstrosity that slashed through your party nearly killed trinket  but was defeated by you  you managed to make your way across this bone field and discover what appears to be a camp  across a number of pillars in the distance vax went ahead and stealthed up looked over and saw  that there was a camp /none/ of duergar and apparently the surviving queen ulara giving them orders next  to grog who is currently bolted by iron bands to some sort of a cart that theyve been dragging him  through this tunnel passage with and that is where we have left off so  taliesin i think ive got a plan  sam oh because i did too  taliesin you have a plan  sam no i want to hear yours lets do them both without telling and just see what happens  taliesin ill roshambo you for it  orion i actually i /none/ actually like this idea scanlan  taliesin keyleth can meld through rock so if we can get the attention of everyone whos guarding  grog she could slip through while were drawing them out and get through and let him go in the  midst of the fight  sam that works with my plan  taliesin that works with your plan  sam my plan was to was to go in there and distract them while you did something  all laugh  laura perfect plan  taliesin i like that plan  sam i hadnt completed the thought /none/ because the something hadnt been worked out  taliesin you were 80 there  liam actually let me tell you all that grog is up here you didnt know  taliesin i assumed youd come back by now  liam no im still up there  sam that raises the stakes  all laugh  liam last week i said come up now and thats when he called it  orion and i had already taken off so im already headed there  matt all right  taliesin well hes at least said come up now  marisha so were /none/ were there  matt so tiberius roll a stealth check  laura great great tiberius go for it  taliesin damn it  liam hold on let me show you my collection of tin cans tied to my tail  orion actually you know what no im fine ill just roll  travis yeah roll the shit out of that  orion 16  matt 16 okay so as tiberius coasts up along the back portion of vaxs arrival point  liam whispering where is everybody  laura whispering were on our way  orion whispering i dont know i /none/ heard you  matt you notice one of the duergar looks over his shoulder in your direction  sam and plan over  matt and begins to make a few steps in that direction  marisha wait who you  sam yeah he went in anyway  laura yeah and hes not stealthed enough  liam all right i grab tiberius by the snout and pull him back around the edge of that rock im  just doing it pulling my dagger out  matt all right so the duergar continues to move forward towards the edge of the rock /none/  liam oh come up here please  laura okay we stealth can i head that way  liam and im throwing a knife into the dwarfs neck  sam oh jesus thats not very stealthy at all  liam well its coming over  matt all right so the rest of you guys go ahead and roll stealth  liam hes not waiting  sam weve been doing this for 30 seconds were already in a fight i was going to distract them  liam im not going to stand here and wait for the duergar to walk around /none/ the corner  orion i was going to distract them too  matt and you got one of them  travis its a classic movie moment  sam im going in im walking into the camp  marisha what wait okay wait are we abandoning the plan  taliesin no were just going for it right now  marisha all right  liam oh my god  matt all right so the rest of you  laura i rolled a nine so it doesnt even matter  matt it doesnt matter at this point  taliesin i rolled a ten /none/ yeah  matt okay so the rest of you begin trudging in down this tunnel towards the edge  taliesin goddamn  matt clarota and kima are laughs holding up the back rear end  liam you know if you wait five minutes i can at least take one out  matt as scanlan approaches the duergar immediately turns around  marisha hi duergar  liam right up behind him surprise sound effect cut his neck cut the throat  marisha i turn into an earth elemental  matt all rightsimultaneously as you approach the duergar looks behind gives you /none/ a glance and  you can see his eyes normally pupilless eyes of the ashyskinned duergar are now glowing with an  odd dull green color that you havent seen in duergar previously and he starts rushing towards  you hes going to make a simultaneous round rushing up to you for an attack while you release  your two attacks against him and you release your dagger  marisha go twinsies  travis who hits scanlan  matt this calls for a music change  sam sighs well the best laid plans  laura my first one was an /none/ ultimate fail  matt okay good to know all right the first duergar swings at you with his war hammer to you  scanlan that comes down with a 12  sam 12 versus armor class  matt versus your armor class yeah  sam im okay  matt you pull back and the giant war hammer swings past you and you duck out of the way  thankfully though the duergar are relatively small youre much smaller and as a gnome you  slip right out of the path of the actual hammer blow your first arrow misses  /none/ second one you said hits  laura 25  matt 25 definitively hits go ahead and roll damage  laura ugh why why oh im cursed today eight  matt eight damage  laura eight damage  matt all right so after he swings past scanlan who ducks out of the way one arrow whizzing  sound effect just cruises over his head and you hear it scattering and clattering against the  rocks in the distance he looks over in your direction as the second one just grazes his  shoulder you can see a little bit of blood /none/ begin to spill but it doesnt even turn his head  towards the wound hes still just glaring at you angrily while you throw your dagger from behind  him not even aware of your presence currently  liam 20 natural 20  taliesin first of the night  liam there is a magnet inside this die i should be just full disclosure okay so natural 20  matt yeah were buying you new dice next week  laura yeah yeah will you buy me new dice as well thank you  matt so as you pull tiberius back clutching /none/ the front of his snout keeping him quiet you pull a  dagger out toss it in the air catch it and fling it at full speed striking true go ahead and roll  damage with sneak attack bonus also multiplied because of the crit  liam yes hes gone hes gone okay  mumbles numbers 47  matt all right so as he turns and the arrow strikes off his shoulder and he glares at you  vex he pulls back his hammer again looking down at scanlan coming down for a blow to basically  bash his skull /none/ in but he stops suddenly as you see this blade protrude from the front of his  skull his glowing eyes fade back to a dull pale whitish color and his body slumps onto the ground  as your dagger magically returns to your hand from below duergar down  laura i nod to you good job  sam i step forward and say is her name ulara  matt ulara queen ulara  sam queen ulara show yourself step out and talk to us everyone hold  matt and the rest of you are you all staying where you /none/ are are you coming  forward with scanlan  marisha oh youre talking were doing a talking thing  laura lets step up behind him i want to step up and make him look more imposing with me and  trinket behind him  marisha i am i am going hang on wait what are you do what  laura i want to step up behind scanlan with a bear behind him and make him look more imposing  marisha im going to slink back into the shadows and turn into an earth elemental and sink  into the ground /none/  matt okay  marisha and hopefully they dont see that happen  matt keyleth is no longer keyleth  laura laughs whoa youre huge  matt and then swoosh sound effects fades underneath the earth somewhere just slips into  it almost like sand through an hourglass you just vanish beneath the surface of the rock  travis great way to leave a party  matt kima steps forward making a point to step angrily onto the corpse of the duergar you hear  the crunching of bone and metal as she steps over his corpse percy youre approaching /town/ as well  taliesin im staying a little bit back  matt okay so about there  taliesin yeah about there  matt all right clarotas going to move off to the side here and pike is going to come and  get the center point she feels the most applicable to heal  liam dm  matt yes  liam where on the map is the queen right now  matt you dont see right now  liam dont see her  sam shes in the tent shes in the tent right  matt grog which is right over /none/ here  orion i see whats going on and i rub my ring and i go invisible  matt okay  orion greater invisibility  matt all right so tiberius also vanishes from view you glance over your shoulder vax and  notice that tiberius is just gone just whoosh vanished all right so as you shouted this out  the secondary duergar now turns and first off make a persuasion check well no in this case  intimidation i think is what this is going to be  sam do i roll again  matt ill say okay because /none/ it is a different skill so yeah  orion matt id like to move to the other side  matt youll get about there with this round  sam 22  matt 22  liam fucking love this game  matt all right as you shout this the duergar grabs this warpick from his side looks at you  angrily and begins to step forward as a giant grizzly bear and the rest of the party filters up  behind you in full flying v formation he puts his pick to his side and yells off his shoulder my  /town/ queen weve got company  as he does the flaps of the far end of the tent here open up theres a dwarf there not a  duergar but a dwarf that is standing there to the side that steps out of the way and queen ulara  steps out as well you see her angrily look off to the side sighs angrily well then it  appears that we have some business to discuss  and she begins to step past the front of the fire way stopping right next to the fire pit keeping  a good 15foot /none/ distance with her arms crossed the dwarf comes and flanks her on this side and  you now see while i cannot seem to find the figure for the life of me right now to represent  it well use this for the time being there is an elf also flanking her normal looking elf  dressed in what looks like a fine chainmail attire longsword at the side so theres an elf  and a dwarf both flanking  liam and theyre clearly with her  matt they are at her side like theyre ready to defend her  /none/ liam they could be charmed  sam queen ulara if i may have a word let us spare each other lots of bloodshed and just have a  chat before we fight is that all right  matt talk small annoying creature and perhaps itll delay the inevitable  sam my friends and i have come  laura hello  sam hi yes weve come from the above world the normal world lets say to your fine kingdom  down here below and we were on a mission were a bit of i dont want to brag but were a /town/ bit of  an elite task force sent in by kingdoms and kings that you probably havent heard of way down below  but anyway ill spare you  matt hold that thought just for a second percy go ahead and roll a perception check  travis oh shit when its out of the blue like that its always bad  taliesin ten  matt okay continue  liam wait dm vax is creeping along the back of that tent and curving around  matt all right  liam thank you  orion im going to do the earring and /none/ go to scanlan and be like keep it simple will you i  mean really calm down  sam laughs copy that  travis yeah how could you  sam my lady we have come on a mission to save someone that you were holding captive we have  completed our mission and in the melee in that hovel you called a palace back there we lost one  of our own and we would like him back now ill make it very simple because my fellows are begging  me to keep things simple its a simple binary choice /none/ you can all die right now or you can turn  over our friend and we will probably probably leave you in peace i would promise but i dont  make promises to dogs  travis highpitched ooh oh snap  marisha oh shit i move in behind where the pillar is but in the ground  matt behind where this pillar is in the ground  marisha no im yeah im thereish  matt all right so at that response and youre noticing now as youre getting a better glance at  the queen too the normally white pale /dung/ duergar eyes have a strange green glowish hue to them as  do the two individuals to the right and left of her and she just looks you square in the face  you took my king from me came and slayed him in his own throne room you took something i love i  take something you love hes mine now and im bringing him to his greater destiny  at which point a loud horrendous streaking sound pierces the ears of everyone in this vicinity as  appearing out of a ripple of energy a onceinvisible mind flayer /none/ goes cascading out a  mind blast in a cone that just tears through the entire group here scanlan vex pike as well  trinket percy go ahead and roll an intelligence saving throw  travis ill die once i finally come back  sam saving throw  matt yes  sam what is that  matt roll your saving throw for intelligence  sam okay  liam small square near the top upper left hand  travis at least i dont have to roll for intelligence  sam 21  matt all right percy  laura

accent see this comes in handy more often than youd think  taliesin yeah but while were looking that up im basically going to pull my gun im going to  fire four times into the face of that awful awful screaming bastard  matt of the the mind flayer over here  taliesin yeah the mind flayer  matt /none/ okay so you whip around hes there in your face go ahead and make youre using your action  surge to fire two additional times you said  taliesin yeah  matt okay wow four rounds go for an attack  taliesin first attack with pepperbox is 13  matt 13 unfortunately misses form shifts whooshing sounds and you can feel the psychic  energy of its oppressive mental force causing your hand to miss its aim with  each pull of the trigger  taliesin all right fire shot for 19  matt 19 does hit  taliesin thats /none/ my fire shot so thats  travis put it on him percy lets go  taliesin oh my god this sucks eight points of damage what is this about  matt okay third attack  taliesin third attack  matt spin the

critical  taliesin thats 2d10 i double the dice right  matt yeah  taliesin yeah  matt or /none/ roll and double the dice number but thats fine okay  taliesin so thats that and now im going to take a sharpshooter bonus so oh that sucks  thats 11 that doesnt hit  matt unfortunately so the first one hits the second one actually clips part of its chest  and you can see as it tries to use its psychic abilities to resist the bullet it still pierces  its chest in the side missing everything vital still causing it to makes painful hissing sound  sucks in the air for a moment  taliesin that was /none/ a terrible roll im going to use some movement to dodge left to get out of the  way of that guy  matt okay so going this way  taliesin yeah im going to go yeah about there  matt okay cool probably should get out the laser pointers  travis ill bring him one  sam hey is grog stone  liam grogs tied grog is held by iron bands hes down  travis grogs been hitting the peace pipe  sam hes unconscious  matt you guys dont know you havent seen him yet  liam i /none/ saw him you described it to me last week hes in iron bands held on a cart  laura but hes awake right  matt yeah on a cart you havent checked  marisha iron bands  liam yeah hes tied down  marisha hes on the whole cart though right  matt tiberius youre up next  orion great i peek over the little thing and i go ooh and i throw a fireball from my ring  matt laughs okay where are you throwing it  orion oh right in the juicy spot of those three  matt /none/ right here  orion yeah  matt okay so as theyre all sitting there looking ready to pounce for this series of battle  all of a sudden theres a slight streak of reddish energy in the distance as you all are watching it  looks almost like the fire pit behind them just explodes in this giant fiery ball of red angry  magical fury so go ahead and roll your 8d6 damage  orion mumbling numbers im missing d6s  taliesin theres two more  orion wonderful mumbles thats 31 damage  matt 31 points of damage okay /none/ queen ulara you notice as the duergar are generally considered  as this blasts in this area as well both her and the duergar make their saving throw they have  magic resistance innately against it  travis against magic  matt yeah theyre hardy creatures man however the elf on this side ends up being thrown to the  side and its entire body gets thrown about 2030 feet across from the force of the explosion  landing on the ground lifeless next to you skidding noise on the ground a burnt cinder  the dwarf takes the brunt /none/ of it as well appears to still be alive but looks very horribly burned  and is looking at its hands now like pained grunting sound barely standing  orion and then i spend two sorcerer points to crackling sound effect form an ice knife  matt before we get to that point grog you also take that damage  travis oh how many points  liam hes a freaking sponge hell be fine  orion why  matt because you said you threw it in the fire there grogs right there on a cart  orion i said the /none/ juicy spot of those three i knew grog was there of course  i wouldnt throw it there  travis i can take it  orion okay fine  all laugh  matt i pointed here  orion yeah but i thought i dont know  matt be specific next time but yeah thats okay he can take it  marisha were down all of our laser pointers  orion and i throw that right in the back of queenys head  matt okay all right go for it so as you coalesce this arcane energy into this blue cold /none/  freezing plume of moisture in your hand it forms into this giant jagged blade of ice and you  chuck it in a straight line go ahead and roll a d20 plus your spell attack modifier  marisha get it get some  orion 19  matt 19 does hit even with her mage armor  orion sweet and then thats 1d10 so thats a ten and then it exploding sound effect  shatters and then does where the fuck is it 2d6 damage as well  matt okay to her and everyone go for it  orion in /none/ a fivefoot radius so yeah  matt right  orion and that guys like right next to her right  matt yeah  travis whispering hey matt how much damage did i take  matt what was the damage on the fireball  orion 31  matt 31 31 points of fire damage  travis cool  orion cool and thats four points of damage to both of them  laura are you dead  matt to both of them all right well for one four damage is enough as the shards of ice from  the back of ularas /none/ torso explode into this spray of jagged ice chunks it pierces continuously the  right side of this dwarf who then falls to the ground grasping at his wounds and trying to stand  to his feet before falling over unconscious right there  orion and i have greater invisibility so im still invisible and i just peek back behind the  rock  matt singing mysterious fireball ice dagger source okay you come to consciousness in  extreme pain as your entire body is immersed briefly in flame  travis painful roaring  matt well get to that in /none/ a second vex vax sorry  liam okay im going to use my feat cunning action for one extra action per turn of combat  use for either dash disengage or hide so im going to double distance and go one two  three four five i still cant see her six maybe seven eight nine ten stop right here  by clarota over enunciating clarota clarota and dagger dagger at this jerkface over here  matt right here  liam yep  matt all right  liam that was stealthed by the way  matt right roll a stealth /none/ check  liam all right okay and im going to use luck okay so stealth is 23  matt okay  liam and he hasnt gone yet so for the assassinate feat for rogues if he hasnt gone  yet this is a critical hit  matt in theory combat already began when he attacked the rest of your party  liam okay  matt combats begun sorry  liam the feat says if you have the jump if you go before the persons gone but we can talk about  that later  matt correct but theyve already attacked /none/ half your party with the mind blast so in theory the  battles already begun  liam all right okay so keen dagger flying through the air  matt all right  liam oh i didnt hit to okay so that hits 16 plus 27  matt that definitively hits yes  liam okay so three plus mumbles  laura kill him  liam muttering numbers 36 total  matt 36 points of damage all right so the mind flayer which is after it finishes a mind  blast you can see it beginning to eye what its next target /none/ would be as percy goes running off to  the side it looks over at its three freshlystunned prey and begins to lumber towards  what looks to be either pike or vex but before it gets a chance to advance though whistling sound  out of nowhere your dagger impact sound pierces it in its shoulder it looks at it and it grasps  for it as its hand tries to pull the dagger out the dagger disappears in a plume of black shadow  energy back into your hand as you throw the other dagger  liam oh /none/ sorry asswipe okay that is a 19  matt 19 does also hit  liam and that is eight damage  matt all right the other dagger the creature actually puts up a little bit of a psychic field  for a second and it stops its momentum it does still manage to strike it but with nowhere near  the damage you were hoping it would cool that ends your turn that brings us to scanlan  sam okay so all thats remaining on the battlefield is the queen and the mind flayer  matt the mind flayer the /none/ queen and this duergar here that has not acted yet  sam all right sighs im going to just bum rush the queen  travis yes i mean  sam and just dive at her just dive full headon straight for her and bear hug her with  banishment  orion oh yeah baby  matt laughing okay  orion you know you can cast that from a distance  sam no you have to its touch  orion is it oh  matt yeah its a touch spell  sam its touch  matt all right so whats your /none/ spell dc i assume youre using your hand cone  sam i do most things through that  matt as you charge forward you pull out your enchanted hand cone and shout the incantation  towards her with an angry glare  sam ooh get lost motherfucker  all laugh  matt it had a dc of 19 for that  sam yeah  matt okay even with her spell resistance she does not resist it  sam its not you its me  all laugh  matt is it an intelligence or wisdom save  sam oh i dont /none/ know things target plane of existence banishment i dont know where does  it say  matt it should say what saving throw it is  sam find it  all laugh  matt i will do this for you on a charisma saving throw or be banished so if it was on anything  but a charisma saving throw she would have shrugged it charisma she does not have in  spades as you reach out she pulls back and you see her beginning to form this crackling bolt of  energy youve seen once before in the throne /none/ room that shot out and hit multiple members of your  party once for a severe amount of damage this would have been a very dangerous round if you  hadnt connected with her right in front of her clavicle she looks at you with this look of  confusion and completely caughtoffguard frustration before her entire form sucking sound  blinks out of existence and is no longer visible on the board  liam bard ass  sam yes  travis get the hell out of there laughs  sam do i get my bonus  matt yeah  /none/ sam im going to give inspiration to grog because he needs it  matt all right so grog as the flames die down you look over and watch scanlan rush up and  completely as far as you know disintegrate the duergar queen who took you and has been torturing  you these past few days  travis wow  all laugh  matt with that he looks over to you and gives you a little wink and a smile go ahead and take  an inspiration dice which for him is now a d10  laura an upgrade  /none/ travis heck yeah  matt so you can add that inspiration die to any ability checks any skill checks saving throws  sam for instance busting through iron bars  travis thank you thank you  matt all right well it would be ularas turn shes going to go ahead and attempt to make her  saving throw does not make it still somewhere in some other plane that youre unaware of  sam shes in a better place  matt keyleth its your turn  marisha all right im going to phase through the ground because i can and /none/ pop up right there next  to grog  matt all right crashing sound grog you all of sudden as you look over from scanlan with this  smiling face this giant mountain of rock and earth just lumbers up out of the ground  travis gasps oh shit  marisha and in rock speak i say grog its okay its keyleth  matt you hear makes deep gargled sounds  travis screams in terror  matt laughs  marisha i still dont really grasp that you cant  matt its your first time doing elemental form youre still trying /none/ to figure it out  marisha seeing that hes still tied up im going to pick up the whole crate and put him over my  no im going to football carry him like this  matt okay laughs  sam is he on something  matt hes strapped to a giant cart  sam shes carrying the whole thing  matt yeah  sam awesome  matt because earth elemental  sam awesome  matt so youre there now you still have about whats the speed of  marisha 30  matt 30 so youve got about say ten /none/ more squares or im sorry ten more feet you can go  marisha im going to start football rushing that way  matt this way all right one two all right there we go  marisha get the fuck out  matt youre now being carried by this giant lumbering earth elemental that is just bringing  you under its arm great vex do you make your saving throw intelligence  laura plus intelligence  matt intelligence saving throw that should be at the top  laura 23  matt 23 using your mind you shrug off the remainder of /none/ the ability that does end your turn  but youre no longer stunned which is nice  laura thats great thats the end of my turn  matt thats the end of your turn  laura do i roll it for trinket too  matt yes trinket as well thank you  laura little trinket gets the little bitty dice oh i dont think he got it no he still rolled  an eight  matt yeah so trinkets still on the ground slowly digging his nose into the dirt trying to  find a way to his  laura /none/ oh does that mean he takes more damage  matt no more damage but currently is unable to function  liam hes dreaming of honey  laura okay hes dreaming of pain  matt yeah very bad news okay that brings us to pike whos also going to try and make her saving  throw fails it unfortunately pike dropped her shield dropped her mace and is clutching the  side of her head screaming silently as the pain is wracking her brain from the inside  that brings us to this duergar whos going to rush over to the /none/ one who just banished his queen  and attempt to his physical form begins to swell with strength and frustration the duergar swings  at you with his war pick that is  sam singing oh dont hit me i cast a little count cutting what is it  matt cutting words  sam cutting words  matt okay so its a 16 go ahead and roll your d10 number its a d10 now  sam thats d10  matt its a d10 now you leveled up yeah  sam i dont even ive never rolled a d10 before laughs /none/  matt now you have  sam this is a d10  matt yep so its a 16  sam it was a four  matt it was a four so it takes that down from a 16 to a 12 which does miss  sam he misses  all laugh  matt so as he rushes towards you  sam singing no dont hit me  matt he stops for a second confused he puts the war pick down for a second like wait argh  groans you gnome doesnt know why he listened to you and is equally /none/ frustrated with himself now  as he is you laughs  travis so good  matt all right that ends the duergars turn that brings us to  liam here comes the illithid  matt not yet this is going to be kima is going to try and make her saving throw kima does make  it does shrug off the effect turns around angrily holding the greatsword that you gave her  staring off at the mind flayer right there  clarota however is going to go ahead and turn this way coalesce a giant ball of electrical  /none/ energy into his hand and release an arcing blast of lightning energy towards this mind flayer who  does make its saving throw however its still a nice 8d6 lightning damage  sam do they know each other are they friends  taliesin not anymore  travis soulmates  laura i think that guy dated clarotas exgirlfriend  matt so 20 points of lightning damage as the blue energy arcs off and you see it grounds  itself on the incline of this tunnel you guys have heading down the mind flayer visibly  is burned charred wounded it looks /none/ really really rough that ends clarotas turn  kimas turn  back to the top of the round the mind flayer looks at its certain circumstance puts its hands  together like this it seems to concentrate  orion i see it i cast counterspell fwoosh  matt okay all right its a reflex counterspell in this edition is so good  laura thats great  matt all right so this would be counterspell  liam come on tibs tibberhoods  matt all right counterspell so make an ability check so add a d20 plus five to it  sam /none/ thats nothing thats no numbers  marisha oh there we go  sam thats a good number  orion what is that 22  matt 22 thatll do it so as this entity youve seen before they tend to like create this small  localized portal into some other plane and then like step through and vanish you see it begins to  coalesce the same arcane energy and for a moment you see a spark of some sort of door beginning to  open as tiberius steps from behind the rock releases this torrent of sparkling arcane energy  /none/ that closes the gate entirely and the mind flayer for a second looks confused before it across the  way to wherever it came from and sees nothing  liam oh so sorry  travis are you still invisible  taliesin so sad so sad  matt and is going to turn tail and run  laura gasp just running  travis with his feet  laura can i shoot him  sam he ran  matt well yeah essentially levitating away  travis does he have a goofy run  matt its more its a gliding its a whoosh /town/ about five or six inches off the ground  marisha shoot her  matt percy youre up  laura shoot him percy  taliesin okay im going to take a step towards whos buggering scanlan over there  matt a duergar  taliesin its a duergar im just going to take a shot at him really quick  sam dont hit me  matt okay  taliesin not going to hit you  matt hard to see him right now theres a big tent in the way if you want to take a step  forward continue moving  taliesin /none/ ill take a step forward im going to continue moving this is going  to be a running shot  matt okay so as you turn pull your gun off to the side explosion offhand fire  taliesin 18  matt 18 does hit  sam i dont like guns  taliesin thats dont go anywhere thats nine damage  matt nine damage all right  taliesin and im going to shoot again  matt all right  taliesin 18  matt 18 that also hits  liam bad news  taliesin eight damage bad news has not come out /none/ yet this is just my little pepperbox  matt all right so as you turn the corner you fire once take another step forward go click  click over the next barrel fire a second time the duergar which was attacking you you see part  of its still burnt from the fireball which was tossed the first round hes frustrated and angry  that you caused him to somehow lower his guard when he attacked you last  sam yeah  all laugh  matt you see him gearing up for another twohanded strike down at this tiny gnome /none/  character in front of him the first blow hits the war pick knocking it out of his hands he looks  over confused at you as the second blast hits him right in the side of the face completely  destroying this side of his head entirely this wet gurgle as the duergar slumps to the ground  almost on top of you but you step out of the way as his body boof hits the ground right there  laura nice nice percy  taliesin bam  liam where does he get such wonderful toys  taliesin i /none/ make them  matt thats percys turn tiberius  sam you want to chase them  orion im going to slink my way all the way behind the other rock  matt over here  orion towards everybody closer yeah back there you go  matt okay  orion im going to yeah screw it ill do another fireball at the illithid going away  where do you think youre going fwoosh  matt so as you fire this beam over here it detonates in the distance safely far enough away  from the party go ahead and roll damage /none/ for that fireball as the mind flayer that is drifting away  glances over its shoulder you see its greenish glowing eyes go wide for a second cartoonstyle  oh shit  travis did you go fireball as you do it hadouken  matt and with its advantage against the spell its a dexterity save correct  orion yeah so thats  matt doesnt make it  orion 19  matt 19 all right 19 damage  orion yep  matt okay as the mind flayers drifting away you guys see this arc of red beaming energy  whoosh off /none/ in the distance explosion you see rocks cascade off the top of the wall hitting the  ground with a force as the entire tunnel shakes and rocks as the smoke and the flames dissipate  all you see is this pile of blackened creature on the ground from where the mind flayer once stood  travis oh peace out mind gobbler  laura is that everybodys  sam fellows gather around she might come back at any moment and we should be here to surround  her when she comes back  laura okay yeah  sam and someone /none/ get grog out of that thing  orion oh crap i forgot about that one  laura yeah how do we get grog out  matt grog  travis what  matt while theyre all doing this what do you want to do  travis well am i still chained up to the cart  matt yeah these iron bands are across your entire body  laura being carried by an earth elemental  travis excuse me giant rock thing could you perhaps get me out of this shit  liam i start hiking back towards grog  laura pike /none/ and trinket are they still stunned or are they better  matt theyve shrugged it off by now  laura okay then i run over and try to see what i can do  matt ulara still cant make her saving throw for the life of her even with resistance  laura can i go try to mess with the things on  matt oh yeah as you guys approach and begin making your way up to the front here grab these  duergar  orion and ill move on the other side of that rock so i can see /none/ better and have line of sight  matt over here  orion no on that side yeah  matt okay all right so as the rest of you all slowly trudge up and gather around this vicinity  laura grog are you hurt  travis i cant tell yet  taliesin im keeping my distance  matt there  taliesin yeah  matt all right so  travis im still in this wonderful therapeutic chair  matt so you go ahead and you try and pull the bars off is that what youre doing what are you  doing  /none/ travis are they bars  matt theyre iron bands that surround you  marisha dont want to hurt him  travis but its a wooden cart  is it a wooden cart  laura maybe bust the wood on the bottom  travis or just smash the cart  sam or he can pick a lock  liam its what i do  marisha oh is there a lock on the bars yeah  matt yeah theres an intricate lock mechanism  marisha try that first before i suplex grog  matt all right so so the earth elemental lumbers /none/ forth and presents the cart on the ground  in front of you impact sound one of the wheels breaking noise  travis thank you  matt cracks a little bit in the process  liam give me a little space let me look at this can i detect traps on his bands  sam checking for traps she could come back at any second hurry up  laura i keep my arrow notched  liam thats a 17  laura in case she does come back  matt 17  liam yeah  matt okay they appear to be /none/ just general locks  liam and are there locks contraptions on them  matt there is a lock on them yes so go ahead and make your  liam 19  matt 19 tink the band thats part way across the waist opens freely on  the hinge on the one side  travis was there just one  matt yeah that was the one  travis groans in relief oh my god  matt so go ahead and make an athletics check i mean theres multiple bands around you across  your shoulders your torso your legs your ankles /none/  liam im going to move on to the next one  travis 25  liam and a 25 on my lock pick  matt okay you get a second band you rolled a 25 and marisha do you want to go ahead and make  an athletics check as well or that would be a strength check for you  marisha for what  matt for your form your elemental form to try and pull the bands off of grog  marisha okay  matt unless you want to do something else  taliesin im going to recommend to /none/ pike that she do a bit of healing  laura oh pike can you heal trinket hes really almost dead  sam is pike okay  matt pike comes over and spends a 3rdlevel healing spell  marisha i failed  laura you failed what  taliesin life oh wow yeah you did  marisha strength check  matt okay trinket heals 21  laura oh good  liam vax is moving to the next band thats a 24  travis i got a 25 does that not help  matt yeah between the two of you over the next /none/ few seconds or so you pick the next one and with  that remaining push you force the rest of the bands off grog you make  your way up to your feet  travis groans in relief  matt there we go at that point in time theres a slight ripple in the space right before this  fire pit and in that place ulara queen ulara reappears again  sam hold her  laura ive been waiting for it  marisha can i grab her  orion wait can i do something can we react to this  /none/ matt yeah  orion i see it and i cast hold person  matt okay all right as you finish the spell you can see this glow of yellowish holding energy  almost like these mystical shackles begin to tighten around her and then fade unaffected  laura i release an arrow  sam i also cast hold person  matt okay so you go ahead and loose your arrow so go ahead and roll for your attack all right  laura 29  matt 29 okay that does hit you can see now the second set of shackles spins /none/ around her she  brings her hand up like this and they just scatter around her resisting a second hold person now  all her saving throws are coming through  marisha can i just grab her as an earth elemental just like mumbles with a deep voice  matt if you want to  marisha yeah  matt so damage on the attack  laura i hunters mark her as well  matt oh there you go see that chatroom  laura what is that 13  liam 12  laura 12 plus thats 16 total  matt 16 /none/ damage all right  taliesin im going to take a headshot with bad news  liam wait  taliesin oh are you doing something  laura we need to talk to her  taliesin okay  marisha i bear hug her  matt okay so go ahead and make an athletics check  marisha athletics i dont have that  matt i know its just a strength check then roll a d20 and add your strength modifier  marisha ooh thats better 23  matt 23 you bound up behind her and as she looks over her shoulder the arrow /none/ piercing her  shoulder shes looking pretty rough you can see the blood beginning to pool underneath her robe  there her eyes go wide  laura it would be in your best interest to not struggle  matt at which point the giant arms go impact noise behind her and the earth elemental lifts  her off her feet groans in pain you can see her now her feet dangling angrily in the air a  couple of seconds pass before she pants all right so lets make a deal shall we  laura laughs youre in no place /none/ to negotiate  sam we have everything that we have come here for what can you possibly offer us that we dont  already have  matt valid point what purpose do i serve you should let me go  sam let you go i tried to talk to you and you almost tried to get us killed  liam vox machina our purposes here are done but lady kima she has further to go and i am  curious your highness if you know anything about this kvarn chap or gal or thing we have heard  his or /none/ her name they seem to be famous in these parts i was wondering if  you know anything about kvarn  matt are you rolling persuasion for this  liam yes i am so well thats a two  laura so bad  matt she goes i know many things and she leans forward a little bit and then spits right in  your face  laura oh wonderful clarota do you want to suck her mind  marisha i tighten my grip on her a bit  liam vexahlia would you come up and talk to this  laura /none/ im already here  matt clarota at which steps forward and brings his hand up  marisha oh thats true we dont need her we just need her brain  matt as clarota steps forward putting his hand out this voice echoes through all of your minds  communally now tell us what you know and you see his eyes flicker with a strange blue energy  liam yeah professor x  taliesin mans got to eat  matt and you see ularas eyes glaze over and fill with the same blue arcane energy that clarota  was briefly having /none/ drift out of his eyes ulara stops struggling and the mouth goes into this  weird grin for a second and just calmly says liberation liberation is what it brings us  liberation from physical limitation liberation from the pain of the light and she looks up as  she says that we all shall rise kvarn the guiding darkness the sun shall hold no sway and  we shall walk the surface once again  orion what is all this poppycock  laura what is kvarn  matt kvarn came to us showed us how through unification we could /none/ be better than we ever were  laura i didnt ask what he did i asked what he is  matt kvarn at which point theres a shudder in her body and her eyes go from this strange blue  color to this strange swimming black that covers the entirety of each eye at which point she  shakes for a second her shoulders shift and you clutch her in your arms as you do you see the  blackness now has that same green glow that the rest of them had but its framing the pools of  shadow /none/ that her eyes have become  her jaw falls slack for a second and this voice comes through ah there chuckles there we  are i can see you all so clearly  orion not me  matt youd be surprised dragonborn  all gasp  orion youre pretty good  all laugh  matt word has reached my ears but to see you to look upon you is everything come you are  close yes come to me as my guests i invite you the temple doors are open id like to see  you in person  orion /none/ stammers can you be more specific like do we go left or right or specific  matt youre already on the right path come to me you are my treasured guests at which point  the blackness in the eyes begins to intensify and begin to spill like black tears from the face her  body shudders before the back convulses and then falls limp a little bit of  smoke rising from the mouth  laura i check her pulse  matt she has definitely given up the ghost  sam try to heal her  laura does she /none/ have anything awesome on that we can take  taliesin i wasnt going to say it  sam youre looting her already  taliesin i was waiting for someone else to say it  liam what a mercenary  laura is she dead can we take her outfit laughs  matt all right so as you guys glance around you find other than the

greatgreatgrandfather wilhand who left his  family at a young age after a dream a dream that changed the course of the trickfoot family  wilhand devoted his life to sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a  life of service and devotion  as a child pike seemed to have an affinity to heal whether it was animals people or even  flowers she felt she had a /none/ purpose in making things whole that had once been broken she  studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic  she lived a peaceful life quiet and simple until one day wilhand was captured and almost killed by  a group of goliath barbarians one of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent  gnome and he himself was beaten bloodied and left for dead abandoned by his herd wilhand went  to pike for help she prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could bringing him back to  life  /none/ when he awoke she discovered his name was grog strongjaw after that they were best of friends  a rather unlikely pair little did she know that in a few years time grog would soon return the  favor and bring her back from the clutches of death roar crunch  after being killed in battle pike felt angry she wanted to be stronger so that it would never  happen again she spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship  called the broken howl  gripping her holy symbol in one hand /none/ and her morningstar in the other this time pike is  ready  travis right listen up if you have ale then you have a friend in grog strongjaw a goliath of  towering height and

but after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly  gnome in the woods he objected to the killing of such an innocent life a creature of impulse grog  felt only pity for this well this terrified little thing and his disobedience cost him  dearly  beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader his uncle kevdak grog was abandoned and left to die  exiled from his herd it was then that the relative of the /none/ very gnome he fought to save  saved him it was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike that healed grog bringing him back  from deaths edge and they have remained close friends ever since  most nights grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches ha or accompanying  scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors  also ale  marisha a first impression of

and beast shaping abilities  well if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts which i do clears throat  anyways it wasnt long before the headmaster of the tribe her father korren realized her true  prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster  just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization  teachings from ancient traditions and exceedingly high expectations every druid leader to be must  embark /none/ on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst  the fellow headmasters they call this the aramente or noble odyssey when her father felt  she was ready he set her on the path to truly discovering herself not knowing when or if she  will

ancient castle of whitestone with so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship percy  turned his attentions to the sciences engineering and naturalism  one day a mysterious couple named lord and lady briarwood came to court during a feast held in  their honor the briarwoods violently took control of the castle killing or imprisoning everyone who  would stand in their way  percy awoke /dung/ chained in the dungeon only to be freed by his younger sister together they fled  chased by the briarwoods men as they ran percys sister took several arrows to the chest  and fell percy kept running eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to  freedom he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat he barely remembered the next two  years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible  then one night percy had a dream a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who  destroyed /none/ his family when he awoke percy began to design his first gun

discovered by a halforc promoter and joined dr  dranzels /town/ spectacular traveling troupe where he learned the ways of the world and honed his  skills as a bard extraordinaire  a loner much of his life scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother  at the hands of a goblin invasion while his years on the road provided many shall we say  educational experiences with the opposite sex deep down scanlan yearns for the one thing hes  never known the true love of a fellow gnome  still scanlan considers himself a lover first performer second and fighter distant third

melts hearts  and makes the females swoon  orion greetings and salutations i am tiberius stormwind i hail from a town called tyrex  located in the heart of draconia  from a politically respected family at the age of 15 i succeeded in passing the sorcerers rite  showing prodigylike control of my magic the judges and the draconian high /none/ council were amazed  at how powerful my spells were for how long i had been training at 20 years old i was the youngest  appointed member of the magic guild in draconian history for the next few years i almost went mad  from the malaise of being a guild member as its rather boring  however one day i happened upon a chamber unused for quite some time in the room were stacks of  books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world for months i would  frequent the chamber and /none/ learned of artifacts from legend  after a long period of research i made a list of artifacts that caught my eye i brought these  findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber i had stumbled  upon was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries and hence were lost forever  i found those answers to be unacceptable  a year later i devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me  leaving draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for /town/ the surrounding kingdoms going from  town to town and making friends and allies in and for the name of draconia being a red dragonborn  i had quite the task on my hands in that respect but it was exactly what i needed so i could  explore the world and find these artifacts as i felt the truth was out there  some may describe me as buffoonish but i say poppycock to all that i am much sharper than most  give me credit for i just dont pay attention to things sometimes ive also been known /none/ to be  rather cunning loyal happygolucky and well dangerous i cant help but show my true scales  every now and then but overall i think im quite friendly for a dragonborn  liam never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men vaxildan learned at a young age to  skip past formality preferring instead to invite himself in your door  along with twin sister vexahlia vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human  peasantry raised by their mother in their early years the twins were eventually sent off to their /town/  father in the elven capital of syngorn but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed  and their time in the capital didnt last the siblings stole away one autumn night and set out  on the open road  after a few years of wandering they eventually decided to return to their mother and journeyed  back to the lands of their youth but instead of finding their childhood home they returned to a  pile of rubble their mother was gone their home burned to ash pressing the townspeople for  answers they learned of /none/ the day the dragon came roar with their ties all severed vaxildan and  his sister set out to find their fortune together in taldorei  an outsider since birth vax quickly learned to solve lifes challenges in his own particular way  often by sidestepping them entirely and when his knack for circumventing adversity isnt enough  knife scraping the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the  difference  laura like so many halfelves vexahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool  reception of a people who dont fully /none/ accept her born of a human mother and an elven father who  only later in life took an interest in their existence vexahlia and her twin brother  vaxildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each  other  it was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in syngorn  the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador he quietly took them in but always  kept an icy distance and after too many years of disdainful /none/ looks the pair decided to leave his  indifference behind and set out on their own  vax took to the cities stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief while vex kept  to the woods she preferred the isolation  always the keen observer she learned to hunt and to track to spy and to shoot and through a  series of fateful events earned herself a companion in the form of a bear her own stolen  trinket to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely  also he is adorable and gives expert massages /none/  dramatic music  matt welcome back

down she begins to gather up her runes and shes casting a  4thlevel spell  laura she shouldve done it before we went to sleep  matt aye but alas shes not here sorry ashley so that would be the equivalent of about  32 hit points shes also going to attempt a medicine roll as well okay you notice there is  some progress that is slow but some of /none/ the burn scarring from the dip in the magma is beginning to  slowly subside fresh skin is beginning to show but its still pretty rough  laura it still smells amazing so if you could just  travis it does smell amazing actually  sam its like a weasel on your leg  laura clarota are we planning on going to your village before we go see kvarn or are we going  after kvarn first im confused  matt kvarn resides within the city the temple  laura oh is he a mind flayer then i mean is /none/ he like you  matt i have not seen him myself since i was cast out before he took the star took my people  under his spell  taliesin just to be clear the temple of what  matt he leans forward for a second the temple we dont know its original purpose the city we  acquired we found we took root yugvoril existed long before our colony did  taliesin okay thats good to know thats very good to know thank you  matt very well he continues floating forward the air still chilly with steadily more /dung/ and more  moisture the rock walls become less and less jagged growing smoother from endless years of  condensation mineral drip and slow erosion begin to give that smooth inner cave look to the  outsides of this tunnel  liam as we walk vax falls in next to keyleth keyleth  marisha yes what  liam were walking are you all right  marisha im doing okay  liam you are  marisha yeah why  liam everything we said last night was true were here for you  marisha im here for you too  taliesin were /none/ having a discussion of how best to go about this  laura while that happens can i use my primeval awareness to sense if i sense any dragons in the  city coming up in front of us  matt certainly as youre walking the group slows with you as you have to really maintain  concentration on this you close your eyes and you consider you sense no sources of dragon within  the radial of your ability to sense in this cavern structure  travis are our feet leaving footprints  matt subtle ones but yeah  travis /none/ son of a bitch dust of tracelessness everywhere  all laugh  travis good  taliesin missed our little flower girl  marisha i know so glad we have him back  taliesin i want to just put something out on the headsets really quickly when we get into the  city i need everyone to promise that were not going to enter the temple no one rush in no one  be brash no one make a poor decision were going to wait no matter what happens dont enter the  temple until weve all had a moment to /none/ figure out whats happening  liam no one be a yahoo  orion agreed  marisha i think its a trap  taliesin if theres going to be a trap its going to be getting us into the temple  marisha he wants us he wants us there  taliesin he literally invited us into the temple  laura so dont go to the temple  taliesin we walk to the temple we dont enter the temple  laura so enter the temple understood  taliesin understood excellent  matt at this point beginning to notice the tunnel itself the /none/ cavern is swaying back and  forth a little bit with this as opposed to a straight path the tunnel is beginning to arc left  and right theres little pockets and crevices beginning to show at certain points and you start  seeing small bits of bluish crystal jutting in small pockets out of cracks in the rock  marisha did you say that there was mushrooms a mushroom forest a fungus  matt clarota yesterday mentioned a fungal forest  marisha but we havent seen it yet but were starting to go into the crystal caverns  matt /none/ starting to find bluish crystals which pike makes a motion yes i saw this in my vision too  laura can i touch some of the crystals are they removable  matt you reach out and touch the crystal as you do go ahead and no  all laugh  taliesin dick move  travis i love it  laura the greed the greed gets me  matt laughs you reach out and touch the crystal and its cold to the touch as is most of  the stone wall and you can see theres condensation on it that gets /none/ on your fingers a  bit its smooth except for the jagged points where the natural formation juts out you tug on  the crystal a little bit find if theres any place there thats moveable and its pretty solid  in that rock wall  marisha does it appear to be producing cold  matt no the temperature doesnt seem different at all to the air there doesnt seem to be a  source at all its the same temperature as the rest of the tunnel  marisha can i do a nature check to figure out what kind /none/ of crystal this may be  matt yeah sure  laura tiberius these look like the crystals on your staff  orion hm oh ooh yes theyre pretty i take out one of my daggers yes i do have daggers  and clicking noise im going to chip away a couple of chunks  taliesin actually lets grab a few chunks i may have an idea for later  marisha 13 for my nature check not that great its all right  taliesin throw a few into the bag of holding  matt all right i will say go ahead /none/ and make an arcana check as well  orion oh yeah okay mumbling 14  matt 14 okay its hardpressed to find out where these crystals came from what their source  is or if they naturally are here or if theyre put there through some other means but the  crystals do have a very very faint magical residual energy to them useless almost its the  equivalent of finding crumbs at the bottom of a cereal box its there you can see at one point  there was something magical about their presence or their creation but it /none/ is long faded  orion cool sweet  travis do you still want more of them  taliesin ill take a few  travis i go hong kong phooey on the wall of crystals with my axe and i just snarling  taliesin thank you  matt when the noise dies down you gather shards and pieces probably enough to fill a small  bucket you can indeed fill your small bucket should you have one  that is your prerogative grog  travis i dont but i have a fancy robe and i put it in there and i /none/ bundle it up  matt okay if you had a stick you could be a crystal hobo  taliesin a fancy bundle of crystals  marisha we also have a fancy bag of holding  laura its in the bag its all in the bag  matt about a half an hour further down this tunnel both vax and vex simultaneously notice a  part of the wall to the left that is actually visibly cracked and what appears to be almost a  narrow passage that juts off to the left however there is a large boulder solid stone /none/ that is  wedged into this apparently blocking the passage  liam grog we need you over here  travis what  laura could you possibly move this very large very heavy boulder for us  liam scanlan you as well  sam of course  travis i need your help  laura pike  travis i would like to move the boulder  matt all right  laura can i perception around it before we do anything  matt certainly go ahead and roll perception  travis its in the path  laura its a side path thats been /none/ blocked  liam 15 for vax  laura oh did you see it it was there and it went like that it was a 20 and then it went  squeaky noise because it was on the side but thats okay 20 is what it ended up as  matt 20 okay both of you guys take a look theres nothing immediately dangerous at all it  just looks like this rock was not naturally formed here of course it looks like it was wedged in  like it was actually placed there intentionally  travis 26 on the strength /none/ check  matt on the strength check so as you guys are explaining this seems to be a fairly  you dont even get to finish your sentence before grog goes grabs the boulder gets underneath  and lifting with the knees atlasstyle puts the weight on the back and groans  sam im singing to help him to inspire him singing push it push it real good push it  push it real good  travis singing push it push it real good  matt with a resounding scraping sound scraping sound and a large crack some of the /none/ rocks that  its wedged in break off and tumble to the sides and you get the boulder free and youre now  clutching it on top of you and its very very heavy  orion oh i use my mage hand and i push it too  matt you lose your balance over the boulder as its now shoved off of its axis  laura oh no  matt it falls behind you slamming into the wall blocking half the passage the passage you guys  were going down immediately you can still pass it you just have to /none/ walk around it and you may  have tweaked something in your back a little in the process  laura oh grog hows your back  travis i roll over on my stomach and i ask trinket to step on my back  laura oh trinket give him a massage hes really good at it  travis i roll over and have trinket step on my back  matt trinket gets up pushes on you with the bear claws  marisha make biscuits trinket make biscuits on grogs back  travis groans in relief  matt you can hear the /none/ cracks  laura can i look down the passageway that was opened up  travis thank god  matt you can the passage is very very thin it can maybe fit you individually it can barely fit  grog when you actually go through the passage proper  sam its pretty spacious in here i think  all laugh  matt for a gnome yes but yeah its pitch black going forward which means you guys can see its  equivalent of low light for you in pitch darkness about 30 feet ahead of you you can see the path /none/  continues for a little bit and then widens up into what looks like a small chamber but youd have to  get closer  laura is it dangerous at all  matt make a perception check  orion everywhere is dangerous  sam how far is the chamber  matt about 30 35 feet back so  liam 21  laura 18  matt best you can tell it just looks like a chamber and it looks like a hallway  taliesin we should investigate  marisha it just looks like a death trap  travis if this is /none/ a tomb im going to be so pissed at the two of you  laura tiberius can you send a little light down that passageway  orion yeah sure you want to shoot an arrow for me love  laura lets do it  liam vax chases the arrow  sam youre just going to go down the hall  liam yeah stealth  matt all right so as the light the arrow shaft vibrantly bursts into bright  tiberiuscreated light it arcs slightly down the hallway only a 35foot distance it goes pretty  quickly and then sound of /none/ arrow embedding itself into what looks like a piece of rock actually  wedging itself into a piece of rock before falling to the ground chipping a chunk upon impact as it  hits you can see its a small roundish oval chamber you can see what looks like small piles  on the ground at the far end still hard to make out from this distance but you are welcome to  enter  liam i followed it  matt you followed it in  liam yeah i rolled a 26 on stealth  matt right you rush in /none/  liam follow up the arrow  sam bear trap  all laugh  matt first thing you understand the air smells faintly of ancient untouched dust and mildew  laura oh no what did we just let loose  matt you glance at the floor and notice what appear to be six longdead bodies strewn across  the ground  marisha how longdead  matt skeletal and covered in webs  sam whos in there just vax right now  matt just now vax  liam im going to check out the very first the closest body to the /none/ exit  matt okay go ahead and make an investigation check  travis nah its fine theyre dead  liam 19  matt 19 okay as you look across the body i mean theres nothing formal about this area  theres no fine chiseled structure it looks like a natural formation it just appears to have been  the final destination for whoever these individuals were and you do notice the way  theyre adorned they were an adventuring party they were people who came down here long ago for  whatever reason and the last destination was this small /none/ cavernous space  liam you said theyre covered in webs  matt there are webs on them but the webs themselves are small natural spider  liam small natural so not bilbo baggins  matt but you do notice that each one of their skulls has a giant hole bored into the bone  itself different places in the skull  liam im just going to start searching all of them  matt anyone else want to do anything  taliesin im going to make my way as well  orion i thought we were all following  matt the /none/ rest of you make your way in one by one its a small room  laura im staying outside with trinket and grog  matt okay you guys hang out there  sam i feel like pike wouldnt want us to do too much damage to these bodies i just feel like she  wouldnt want us to disturb them  liam i dont give a shit about these bodies i care about what they are carrying  matt okay looking at it you notice that they have been here for at least 200 years two of the  bodies /none/ are male humans there are two dwarven bodies one male ones female  laura armor look for armor  matt one female gnome and one halforc  marisha wait wait what  all laugh  orion halforc  marisha halforc okay hang on you listed all that off  sam im going to inspect the gnome  liam youre not even in the room  matt okay so you enter the room roll an investigation check  sam 19  matt okay looking at her you find that most of these bodies have already been for the most part  /none/ turned over and looted some of them have no armor theyre either in plain clothes or it looks  like their bodies have been tossed and taken whatever was on them off you do find buried in  the dirt under the gnomish female what looks to be a pristine ruby worth probably quite a bit  orion im going to do an arcana check of 22 just on the pile of bodies  matt okay ill get to you in just a second you as youre inspecting the bodies on the other side  you come across the dwarven /none/ male is still fully armored  laura ooh  orion nice  matt actually has a golden chainmail on and is clutching what looks like a metal maul the rest  of them have no armor and no weapons but this one is still fully adorned and you also notice that  the female dwarven corpse while devoid of any accoutrements any coin purses belts or anything  does have hidden within the bony clavicle what little bit of stretched dried skin is pulled  against it a pendant that is gleaming blue  liam i grab the pendant and /none/ then i start this looks good for pike so i start taking the  chainmail off  matt you pull the pendant and you look at it it has a very beautiful sapphire emblem and you rub  the dust off of it and you look at it and you recognize this emblem this is the emblem that  adorns house thunderbrand of kraghammer you turn it over and on the back theres an engraving on  the back that says for lorna my love  laura oh didnt he say to bring back some stuff from the underdark  /none/ orion yes this is what we need  sam whos he  travis that name sounds familiar though  laura oh wait your magic guy said to bring back some magic stuff from the underdark  sam from the value of valor tremaine was that his name  orion and thats what this is let me take it and do ill use that arcana check on that  matt yeah the actual amulet itself does have a magical essence to it  orion i think this will do for our friend back up on the surface or under surface  /none/ sam oh its something  laura what is it  sam amulet of the shield  orion mumbling this protective amulet of the shield  adding plus five to your ac against  that attack  laura what does it do  sam it protects you  matt it effectively acts as a shield spell once per day once per short rest  sam once per day  matt once per rest  orion nice its like a magic shield  matt yeah its a reaction  travis do you have to be able to use magic to use it /none/  matt no  travis oh  laura i dont think so who has low ac that could use it  orion well im the only glass cannon  matt so youre going over to the armor youre getting the armor for pike all right as you  reach out and grab the golden chain mail on it the cold air around the chainmail is noticeably  piercingly cold to the touch make a constitution save  laura oh thats why its still oh no  travis what was it  laura one  travis one  matt natural one /dung/  travis we have a natural one  matt all right as you guys are all doing this you hear the sudden groans this clenching of  breath and you glance over real fast and find vax has fallen onto his back and his fingers are  curled back and you can see this dark energy that seeps into his body for a second you can see his  veins pulsing a little bit you feel your form theres no physical damage taken to you  whatsoever but you sense this sapping of your strength and your breath is shallow /none/ you imagine  this is what an elderly person would feel like you have this lack of energy  as youre saying this pike comes over to you kima runs over to you and they both take a look at  you pike starts inspecting you using her medicine and kima they both look at each other  pass a few notes back and forth and they both agree well it appears this dwarven individual  when he came to his end was not very happy and in doing so left a very strong curse behind on his  body /none/ look about to each other  laura everything okay in there  liam wheezing no  sam is he dead  matt no you are considered cursed which means you have disadvantage on all your ability checks  and attacks  laura youre cursed  marisha how do we get rid of this  matt there are spells like remove curse  laura i bet pike has that spell  travis remove curse  laura i dont know  matt pikes not here i dont have her spell list  travis i could try it hold on nope  laura /none/ nothing  marisha what did you touch what did you grab  liam armor it was the armor wasnt it  laura it was that golden armor yeah  travis lets leave the golden armor alone  liam strained i got this for you pike  matt wait a second ha  laura oh no  matt all right  travis oh no dont make him laugh  matt so at which point kima steps forward and pushes everyone away for a second and  concentrates and she reaches up and grabs the holy symbol of bahamut from underneath the /dung/ front  of the leather armor because she still hasnt exchanged it with you and it glows with this  vibrant silver light and the light travels down her arm to her hands to her fingers and she  places it out and reaches towards the armor and as she touches it she winces slightly but you see  this glowing dark furious anger this face arise out of the armor giving off this slight  whispering howl sound whispering howl and then poof dissipate as you see the divine energy  begin to dissipate and glide off her hand /none/ she reaches over and touches you with her hand and  the curse is lifted  sam oh that was easy  matt i looked over and realized that oh she actually has that spell  liam so i grasp kima by the hand and say that is one i owe you thats one i owe you  matt she gives you a wink and says to be honest i just really wanted the armor and she  pats you on the shoulder  liam its yours  matt she takes the golden chain off of the body she chuckles /none/ she tells no youre out of the  room  travis do you need me to create a curtain for you to change behind  laura youre not in the room  matt she finds a cranny in the room she puts on the chain mail replacing the leather armor she  gives back  laura whispers damn it i was trying to get it  matt she does give you the greatsword and then takes the maul from the corpse of this dwarf but  as she takes it from the body she sits down and says a silent /none/ prayer clutches her symbol and as  she does she takes from one of her pouches a small bit of blessed water and tosses it across  the body of the dwarf puts it back away and stands up all right shall we continue  taliesin right  liam as we leave the cavern i give one of these to the dwarven bodies  matt you swear you hear a slight shift in bone  laura ooh  matt in silence left behind in darkness  sam im going to take the ruby too  laura hey did you get /none/ that armor back  liam yeah i got that armor back  laura hey can i have that armor can i have it  liam sorry sis  laura please  liam kima has it  laura no she gave it back  liam no she wore it  laura no she gave it back  matt she put the chain mail on she gave you the leather armor back  laura give it give it  liam oh thats between you and her im not taking armor off of her  laura please can i have that armor  /none/ matt shes holding it in her hands certainly  laura thanks i go put it on i dont know what it is its magic though  matt its whatever armor you gave her  liam wait my armor  laura yeah  liam thats my armor  matt the armor that you gave for her to put on in the emberhold when she had nothing on  liam i gave it to him he gave it to her and youre taking it hey hey hold on a second  laura too late lets just keep moving all right lets just /dung/ keep moving  liam i think we need to roll a brother sister contest die  laura no we should just  liam i grab her by the ear and say thats mine thats mine  laura ow ow come on i need it  liam squeezing her earlobe really hard  laura roll  travis yeah you two roll go for it  laura shit yelling aha its mine its mine  travis laughing sibling justice  matt persuasion versus persuasion is this what this was  liam yeah sure sure  laura sure it was  taliesin they /dung/ played arm punch until one caved  travis laughing its mine its mine  liam its not fair  laura yeah what does it do  liam im not fucking figure it out  laura all right ill just add a bunch of stuff to my stuff  matt you keep talking over each other  marisha are you just having party arguments right now  matt apparently as you guys head back into the cavern you move around the boulder that grog had  moved from the side crevice and as you continue for about another 20 or 30 /none/ minutes some of you  begin to pick up what sounds like the distant lapping of waves against a shore  marisha what  taliesin thats never good  matt wave noises as the tunnel begins to curve larger and larger eventually you come around a  bend and the tunnel opens up into a humongous cavern housing an underground lake circling a  large island from what you can see on the edges of the walls that are closest to you as the island  disappears into darkness about a hundred feet ahead of you there are these blue /none/ crystals that  youve seen throughout this tunnel completely covering the walls of this entire cavern there is  only maybe bits of and places around the wall about five ten feet across where there will be no  crystal otherwise its just grey stone and blue crystal jutting from the sides  marisha i go over to one of the crystal walls and i put my hand on the crystal and i cast daylight  trying to see if i can emanate it up through the dome  matt okay you cast daylight and on the actual crystal source /none/ that you cast it on daylight  emanates from it and gives a bright beacon of light  marisha i want it to light up the crystal trying to see how far i can get it to reach up to the  top  matt right you notice that from the whatever crystal vein structure some of these are connected  by some of them tend to glow in spots but you see its localized all this crystal isnt  interconnected is what this tells you  marisha okay  matt there are pockets here and there that are interconnected /none/ but there are multiple veins of it  going through the entire  taliesin what kind of liquid is this lake made of  matt so as you approach the hard stone surface you guys have been walking on in the tunnel begins  to give way to like a coarse sand almost like a gravelly shore and it appears to be fresh water  its clear the smell is a little musty but not too bad and you approach and you can see theres  just these very gentle very soft waves that occasionally lap up on the shore /none/ but only a few  inches theres not a whole lot of motion to the water within this cavern  taliesin can we see to the bottom is it that clear  matt yeah  taliesin ive got an idea im going to find a small rock oh go ahead  matt ill finish my description chuckles so theres this lake circling this large island  across the way you also see on this side of the shore central there is a large stone bridge that  arches over the lake and makes landfall about roughly 200 feet on the /none/ other side at the very  very tip closest to you of this island its about 15 feet wide this bridge maybe 20 feet and is an  immediate walkway onto this island across  you can see just faintly on the edge of this island a glowing bioluminescent fungal forest that  covers a large portion of this islands top side the edges of it you can see rise up into cliffs  that have eroded over time and are rather stark in places  marisha plants look living things  taliesin clarota is this in any way dangerous /none/  matt clarota as you look over is gliding into the cavern its the closest thing you can imagine  seeing a mind flayer to smiling hes looking about and in response to you a few moments later  he says were near home  taliesin lets all remember his feet dont actually touch the ground  travis right do you know if theres anything in the water  matt he glances over to you there are many things in the water fish crustaceans he points  over and you can see there is this small very pale colorless whitishgray /none/ crab thats over to  the side that looks weird malformed one claw is twisted on itself and dragging behind it and it  skitters off into the water everyone make a perception check  taliesin yay  sam no  laura oh natural 20  matt oh snap  orion 14  marisha 20  taliesin eight  travis six  liam one  matt oh you two as you all walk up to the edge of the shore line and youre inspecting the water  feeling for it you look over and on the far left side of /none/ the shore you can see just below the  waterline what looks like a sunken boat or two  liam i cant see shit  laura what theres a sunken boat in the lake  travis really should i go get it  laura down here clarota why why boats  matt clarota gives you a look i do not know many things wander these tunnels beyond my kin we  are but one of its denizens  laura whos a good swimmer  travis me im actually a really good swimmer  marisha me  liam lady keyleth  /none/ taliesin shes a very good swimmer  laura you guys want to take a look  marisha i run over to the edge of the water and i do a swan dive and as i swan dive i turn into a  shark in the water  matt okay  travis i run to the water as well and i fucking cannonball  all laugh  matt so keyleths form jumps into the air this thin lithe half elven figure that then turns into  this giant shark beast that splash sound into the water underneath a few moments later /none/ grog  jumps in big splashing sound  orion im going to follow and ill stay behind enough to where i can cast do i  have to get in the water also  matt you can you still cant quite see what everyones going for other than what she said  orion okay ill get a little i wont jump in quite yet but ill get to the edge  matt all right the water is freezing cold you could swear this shouldve turned to ice by now  because your veins certainly feel like they have upon impact /none/ you immediately get over that as you  transform into a natural creature thats used to cold water grog its fucking cold  travis one and a half inches me too  all laugh  orion thats a medical condition for a goliath  matt there arent usually this many penis jokes in a session folks it just happens to be one of  those days so glancing down below you see it too there are approximately two and a half boats  that are made of some sort of a combination of wood and metal like a heavily rusted /none/ iron one of  them looks mildly serviceable the other one is broken with a large hole in the bottom of it  marisha i do a lap  matt okay  marisha go check it out  matt you look around there doesnt appear to be much else around but you do catch what looks like  a semblance of a halfeaten corpse a bone that is left partially buried in the ground you dont  know how long thats been there either its bleached bone at this point whatever fishes live  in this landscape have picked it /none/ clean  marisha so theres nothing in the boats at all  matt nope  laura good times  marisha weird  sam awesome  orion we could just keep going  laura maybe you come back  travis ask him if the bridge is boobytrapped  matt make a perception check  marisha make a perception check mumbles yep yep  laura are you still in the water  travis yeah im shivering  marisha 12 as a shark right  matt yeah  liam plus three for shark  matt okay you do a couple laps nothing really /none/ catches your eye  travis gulps i take a big breath and swim down to where the giant shark is can i also perception  check  matt you can also attempt a perception  travis this is like one out of every five games that i get to 12 plus zero  matt you found some boats yo  laura yay  travis boats  matt they are broken  marisha i go and i see that grogs underwater and i flipper him and go up under him and hold on  here we go  matt giant shark /none/ comes up under you and nudges you aggressively and lifts you towards the  surface  liam dolphin hump him a little bit  marisha well youve heard of those never mind im just going to keep going  matt you guys all watch as grog is now riding a shark  laura awesome awesome  travis should we ask clarota if the bridge is safe to travel  laura clarota is that mushroom forest i mean is that your home  sam should we go there should we skip it clarota  matt the forest certainly surrounds the city /none/  marisha i carry grog over to the island on the other side  matt there are many places of entry within this cavern and you see clarota concentrate for a  second and within all of your minds you suddenly have a very clear image of this entire cavern its  layout what strange shape it is where the general overlook is and as clear as day you have  an entire visual of the inside of this cavern  you guys reside down here right by the bridge on this edge of the beach this green represents the /none/  fungus and this you imagine represents the city the temple being central there  laura we should not take the bridge  sam yeah thats a lot of fungus to get through before the city are they still down there in the  water  matt yes they are  sam lets wait until they get back before we decide  matt ill put this down here in case you want people to see that  orion where are we on that map  matt you guys are right here  liam grog can you pull up any of /none/ those boats  travis pull  liam pull them up grog pull them up  laura i like it  marisha i go over and i swim grog over and can i as a shark give some shark push from the  bottom  matt sure  travis oh fuck yes we have an underwater breathing kit that we bought at the store  theres two of them  marisha sick  matt potion  sam i dont know we bought one laughs  travis i wrote two underwater breathing and didnt write what it was  matt two underwater /none/ breathing biscuits two underwater breathing waffles  taliesin it was totally potions  marisha potions  matt im pretty sure it was potions im pretty sure they were potions  orion what type of boat is this  matt you havent had a good look at it yet  marisha i tried to look but im a shark so i dont know shit really its a boat  travis okay so we swim up to the top and we come back to the shore and youre just in the water  still yes  sam whats down there do you /none/ need help  travis it looks like some kind of boat  sam thats all you got  travis my perception is shit  sam well should we try again with someone who has better perception  laura you want me to go down there  travis absolutely  laura all right lets do it  liam ladies and gentlemen were going to pull up one of those boats  laura maybe we should check out the boats first  marisha you want to jump on my back  laura yeah  orion is that all we need to do /none/ okay fine and i walk over to the thing and i jaunt off into  the water  matt tiberius slowly disappears beneath the surface it is cold  orion oh its so cold i take out one of my bottles right before i go under my bottle of  air  sam what  laura his air bottle  matt you see the bubbles break on the surface and then eventually the bubbles stop tiberius may  have drowned you dont know  marisha i can see him  orion i swim over there i use my tail i /none/ think im a good swimmer and i want to swim up to where  i can see the boat  matt okay this doesnt take you too far its maybe 60 feet from the edge of the coastline  orion oh okay is it darkened can i see the boat now  matt you can see as long as youre traveling with a light spell going on which i assume you do  at most points  orion yes i still have my staff  matt but yeah you see there are two and a half boats essentially theyre large /none/ looks like they  were meant specifically for travel youre not quite sure where it may have come from  orion how large is it  matt id say its maybe about 15 almost 20 feet from end to end  orion okay so i notice it youre nudging the one that you want right is thats whats going  on so i notice that  liam pull it up  marisha i try and push it  orion i ping my ioun stone direct telekinesis to lift up the boat out  matt so youre putting your ioun stone /none/ on  sam he gave the other one to me  matt oh got you okay so you put on the ioun stone  orion and i cast telekinesis on the boat to lift it up  matt okay  marisha and i try to swim underneath it  matt okay theres a rustle in the waves on the surface of the water as you see all of a sudden  this impact sound this bowing and splashing begins to occur the ship begins to rise out of  the sediment on the bottom of the lake  orion i /none/ try to get it just right on the lip  matt it gets up its filled with water you tip it on its side and spill the rest of the water  out theres still a large hole on the bottom of the boat on the inside and you carry it over  back to the surface of the shore and rest it gently onto the rock  laura can you fit that boat in your wheel of mending  orion im underwater im going to jaunt back up up to the surface  laura tiberius welcome to the surface /none/ can you use your wheel of mending on that boat that you  just pulled up  orion i put my bottle away i dont know its a good question i mean i dont see why not  sam percy could assist hes got some engineering  taliesin well i cant help with the wheel but i could repair the boat in theory  orion percy why dont you give it a whack before we put a boat on the mending wheel  taliesin im going to make a list of things that im going to need i may have /none/ to send them down  for more parts of boats from the other boats  laura try the wheel first  matt telekinesis is still in effect currently so if you wanted to do that now would be the time  taliesin bring up the broken boat  orion oh yes here you are  matt okay so tiberius comes back with the half boat essentially thats cracked in half and part  of it is ruined and broken but theres still a sizeable amount of oxidized iron metal and wood  here that you think would be serviceable for /none/ repairs  taliesin please dont roll a one okay so im going to do a little tinkering to see if i can get  this fixed  matt okay  taliesin unless you want to try the wheel first  matt its up to you guys so youre going to go ahead and make a tinkering check  taliesin ill do a tinkering check first and then try the wheel  orion why dont you tinker it first  matt anyone want to help  taliesin what do i use as my modifier  matt i would say this is /none/ a key point in time for a scanlan song  sam oh yes of course  matt you use this bardic inspiration specifically for stuff like this  sam oh i do yes i will inspire you i dont know what to sing whats a boat song  marisha singing the love boat  sam how does it start  taliesin im not feeling very inspired  sam singing hesitantly something excitings waiting for you  all laugh  sam singing im on a boat motherfucker im on a motherfucking boat speaking thats all i  got  taliesin i /none/ feel inspired  matt ill give you a d6 for that  all laugh  liam singing sailing  sam singing takes me away to where ive always heard it go  taliesin thats worth a d10  matt if it wasnt vax singing  taliesin okay  matt go for it  taliesin all right what do i add to the modifier by the way  matt you add whatever your tinkering bonus is which should be your dex  taliesin my dex modifier thanks thank god 13  matt 13 total  taliesin yeah 13 total  matt /none/ okay you take a while with it it takes a little bit longer than you anticipated but you  have your general tools with you you hammer away about an hour and a half to two hours later  youre sweating your muscles are sore but you feel like youve managed to get the hole for the  most part patched now its just to test its buoyancy  sam you want to try the mending wheel  orion my spell doesnt last that long  taliesin lets put it in the water and see what happens  travis i /none/ start pushing the boat back in the water and i jump in and i start jumping up and down  matt you push it in you leap in the boat it impact sound gives to the 600 pounds that are  grog it splashes a bit it lifts it seems to be holding its leaving ripples in the water  laura will it fit all of us you think  marisha im going to stay a shark and follow in the water  sam lets pile in the boat  marisha can i tow them  taliesin i was about /none/ to say we can make a harness out of rope  marisha yeah  taliesin well be less conspicuous  marisha yeah not as much rowing  taliesin shark power is far less conspicuous  orion i saunter on the boat up next to grog and go excuse me as i open the bag of holding and  take out the magic carpet sound of carpet unfurling and i hop on that  laura i get on the magic carpet  orion id rather be a free agent on this one im not here to fight on water  taliesin /none/ im setting up a gun mount on the boat just in case  marisha do you guys want to get out the rope and put it around me  taliesin well get out the rope and throw a loop for you to grab  marisha i swim through the loop  laura trinket get in the boat  sam i just want to know which way were sailing are we going left  liam clarota put the image all in our heads  taliesin see theres an island over on that side  sam this way or do we want /none/ to go this way  liam vox machina there is an island there are also two small caves and  laura theres three small caves  liam where  laura well two small caves and then a path  liam two and then rivers and paths out yes  marisha do we want to check them all out clear out the fog of war  liam we could go straight for the big prize  orion are we all agreeing that have we all decided to come here or here  laura toward the island i think  marisha i /dung/ think if we can go here to this little island i might be able to do some thinky spyy  scrying stuff before we storm the city  liam what do you mean keyleth  travis loot the cave first and then the island  laura cave first  marisha cave first  travis right cave first  laura and then island lets go there  liam when we eventually want to take the temple and kill this son of a bitch we probably want the  shortest amount of distance on land as possible which means coming in from /none/ the north end where  tiberius is pointing  orion coming in through here which is the least resistance  liam yes i agree  orion directly to the temple  liam but i think were all a little slap happy and curious  laura that might be cliffs on the back end though you guys we wont be able to scale  those  matt best you can tell from the image that was given to you any of those sections along the edge  that have the jagged lines are cliffs  liam but the northwestern edge has /none/ a beach  matt correct  liam but were curious about the island  sam lets just set sail  laura set sail towards the island  liam so vox machina are we going to head around the southern southeastern edge  taliesin yes  laura were going were sailing  liam does anyone know how to steer this thing  marisha im towing us  taliesin were sharkpowered  liam oh towing  laura im on the carpet with you  orion yes  liam that is impressive  matt all right so you guys continue down the right /none/ side of the path you push off into the  water being towed by keyleth in shark form  taliesin aw yeah  laura should we put pass without a trace on us  sam shes a shark  taliesin were pretty stealthy  marisha ill hug the far wall though ill hug the wall  matt you hug the far edge of the water pushing across you find a way around and as you begin to  look up the wall you can see once again how these crystalline structures are spread out across this  entire wall going /none/ up you cant even see the ceiling of the cavern its so high up from your  current perspective it just disappears into darkness  you continue following the path until eventually you come to this choke point here where the land  mass begins to you can see where the beach begins to crest down and touch the water  as you slowly and quietly make your way around the bend you look over and you can see the forest  indeed they appear to be trees but now that you have a better view of it you know /none/ maybe about  400 500 feet off from you right now that bioluminescent glow this very faint glow is given  off by all the plant life all these giant fungal trees the roots have these strange organic  almost like theyre gripping the ground the canopies of them blossom in these strange almost  mushroomlike appendages these fungal bursts that stick off the top and form the treelike canopy  and you can see vines hanging from each of these its a very strange alien forest fauna that even  youre not familiar with in your travels but it /town/ does give off this dull color this faint light  source that does tend to give a general visual view of the landscape on this island  you do see just barely beyond this point looking across the tops of a few buildings in the very  very distance the color of the stone from what you can make out has almost a jade mixed with a  grey marble and you can just faintly make off in the distance one large pyramidlike structure that  comes to a flattened precipice on top  liam this is on the island /none/  matt on the island to your left and there is a very very faint greenish glow at the very top  that matches the coloration of that same glow you saw in the eyes of queen ulara earlier and the  rest of the denizens that were in her party  as you quietly begin to push along you come to the point where theres the beach to your right  and theres the island to the left the island which comes to this incline and then drops off on  a cliff on the far side it has /none/ its own encapsulated fungal forest you can see what looks  like a very very faint bit of ruins on the beachfront that has mostly crumbled and fallen  but for the most part it appears to be fairly empty other than the fungal growth itself  to the right there is another pebble beach same consistency as the beach you first arrived on  liam whats the scale are we talking manhattan and brooklyn or smaller than that  matt to put to scale your boat that you found is about that big  laura oh okay so its /dung/ pretty big then  matt its pretty big  laura okay should we land on the beach and then check out that little cave  travis yeah  taliesin yes i think thats an excellent idea  liam were all very curious  laura all right  sam im not curious  laura as were flying overhead can i get a better look at if theres anything on the beach  matt yeah as you guys come gliding down you look at the beach you see the ruins you see  even though there is no real breeze or wind /dung/ in this cold air there is like a slight swaying  liam on the beach  matt to the trees that reside on this  laura what about the little island the little cave  matt on here  laura yeah  matt best you can see looking down its just a plain pebble beach an inlet there that goes into  the cavern interior of the wall  travis lets get all up in that bad boy  sam go in the cave  travis theres treasure  laura treasure pirates arr  sam i already have a ruby /dung/ im fine  marisha ill stay with the boat as a shark  laura do we fly in tiberius and just go  orion absolutely  laura all right stealth and fly in can we do that is that possible to stealth and fly at the  same time  matt you can certainly try to keep quiet while doing so the cave that actually opens up in the  side of the wall within this cavern is about 20 feet up and about 25 feet across so youre flying  as low as you can but youre still only /none/ about maybe 15 feet off the ground ten to 15 feet are  the rest of you going in  liam well were in the boat but grog and i want to go right  travis nope  liam no  sam ill come  travis im thinking itll be a quick trip  liam is the boat coming up to the beach  travis yep  liam yes all right i scoop up scanlan and go piggyback style like hes my son and jump on the  beach  taliesin ill wait here  matt all right everyone whos /none/ entering the cavern go ahead and make a stealth check  marisha ooh pretty flashy  sam natural 20  travis oh jesus  orion 13  taliesin im in the boat  matt in the boat  laura 13  travis six  liam 27  matt all right  orion oh we are on the carpet  matt as you guys notsostealthily begin to march into the tunnel here you follow it as it bends  around a little bit and it eventually opens up into this larger space and as you enter the room  partway through /none/ this tunnel the scent changes dramatically that cold still water smell begins  to give way to this terrible sulfurous rotting smell very its near septic  and as you enter this room the smell is dreadful and you can tell using your light source over  here there appears to have been some sort of a struggle there are bedrolls and sheets strewn  about and soiled and burned and torn across the floor theres about what looks like three or four  different bedspreads that have been tossed and ruined you can see a semblance of what was /none/ a fire  pit but all the soot and ash has been smeared across the ground to the outside of it there  appears to be a half buried chest or container off in the far corner and you can see what looks to  be four dead bodies in a not too long state of decay you can still see flesh and skin but  theres some bone peeking through and theyre all slumped against the ground against the corners  sam vax why dont you go mess with them  liam im going to use perception on the /none/ chest and the bodies  matt okay  liam that is not that good that is 13  orion im going to use my earring of whisper right now theres some fun things in  here grog youre not wearing it someone tell grog he might need to kill something  laura this looks a little dangerous  taliesin all right  travis were killing something  laura be ready to run  travis i come running in  liam im back from the chest i take out one dagger and throw it at the chest to sink it into /dung/  the lid from a ways back  matt you take the dagger and sound of dagger embedding into wood into the wood doesnt seem  to have any immediate effect  liam okay so i did a 13 perception check i guess on the chest so ill go to try and open it  matt okay  laura oh god  travis has anybody run to the back of the cave yet  sam are we all in the cave  laura were on the carpet  liam youre on my back scanlan  matt grog and percy are /none/ still in the boat at this point  taliesin but were listening in  marisha grogs running in  travis i come running in  matt well youre in the process of stepping out of the boat at this point as you begin to  approach the chest you notice one of the bodies shift moans its head rolls around and it looks  at you  liam pike  matt pike is still back in the boat with percy what she doesnt have one of the earpieces  liam someone call pike  laura percy undead  taliesin all /none/ right were on our way pike come on  matt all right as you guys get out of the boat and begin rushing in that direction you notice  the one body looking over at you with this weird grin youve had a few encounters with zombies or  undead creatures that unnaturally move this one has an intelligence to it that disturbs you you  glance over at the other bodies who are already getting to their feet  orion where are the bodies located  matt we will get to that at the top of our next session /none/  all groan  laura oh no  liam oh nuts  travis no killing  laura were pirates growls  marisha im a shark still  matt yep  liam come back ashley  laura help us ashley  taliesin grog you could throw a shark at something  marisha can you  taliesin you can toss a shark at a zombie  liam you could use the shark like a baseball bat  taliesin you could batteringram a zombie with the shark and just go  orion sharks dont die as soon as they get out of the /none/ water you can last a couple minutes out of  the water if youre a fish  taliesin they have sandpaper skin  matt so laughs so we will pick up next week with the next episode of critical role in which  the party will deal with this sudden surrounding of some strange partiallydecomposed corpses  liam its the undead  matt indeed the overlord has
