none	 in the city and taking some time for themselves in preparation for  the coming harvest close festival found themselves wandering through the streets of  celebration they partook in a number of various games of chance and skill got some fine snacks  and foods challenged themselves got thrown by their other party members won some trinkets and  toys and then ended up signing up to the victory pit the grand tournament that ends the harvest  close festival you managed to catch a few phrases off to the side of the initial lounge you were  signing 
none	 up in where you discovered that war had been declared by the king on the eastern region of  xhorhas that information was to be held back until the festival was over you were held below  with the other competing teams and then one by one you were each presented into the center of the  victory pit tournament where each of you has to battle a challenge of a creature or creatures in a  threetiered structure whoever survives all three bouts gets to share in the final pot prize  currently two of the other teams have 
none	 been knocked out and it only remains to be you and one other  you guys are up first youre pulled into the center and announced as the mighty neins final  round knowing the stubborn stock is watching from behind the distant doorways that lead into the  central arena you all scattered about the sands as the sun begins to get close to dusk shouting  out your various plans and then abandoning them last minute you found places as these heaping  heavy thuds start quaking the ground in arrival before the door swings open out from 
none	 behind it  roaring a frenzied angry hill giant complete with pierced thorns jammed into each side of the  body to drive it to a point of absolute anger and fury comes bashing into the center of the arena  knocks over one of the large pillars and this is where we begin i need everyone to roll initiative  travis lets try and talk to it  liam just wear him down  travis yeah lets try and talk to him  marisha almost a natural 20 almost a 20  taliesin thats mildly adequate  matt 25

none	 matt all righty friends it finishes slamming the large pillar into the ground and wields its  giant club over one shoulder its other hand reaching out for something and glancing over the  field to see what its quarry is nott youre up first  sam is the giant in melee would i get sneak attack damage or no hes not engaged with anybody  right now  matt right now fjord youre hiding back there i think i shifted it  travis yeah  matt no he is not currently engaged  sam okay then i will shriek

none	 friend deven rue who did our map for  the show shes the one who designed it ive been waiting for it to come in thats a point for you  guys if you ever want to shout directions at me of where you want to run thats helpful  laura i love it  matt you ran full sprint towards jester  sam sneak attack damage is so good but i cant that thing can see me im scared im scared  guys im going to fire my crossbow ooh its a two it misses im super scared  
none	 matt it arcs off you hear this distant yelp in the audience way away  taliesin i was going to say what was the number because that things got to have a low ac whats  the actual number  sam oh yeah probably eight  matt yeah no  laura hes got thick skin i think  matt yeah its a pretty hardy physicality even if its a broad target to hit  sam then i will run back the way i came  matt same place you were before  sam no like behind yasha behind that pillar 
none	 over there that wall  laura you said thats north  matt this is north here  laura towards you  sam north always points to the star  laughter  matt caleb youre up  liam i see this giant behemoth and i start backing up to go west around the stone under my  breath singing we are the mighty nein the mighty nein the mighty nein and fire off a fire bolt as  i sneak behind it  matt youre darting around the side  liam no that is no good that is a 13  
none	 matt 13 just hits  sam okay not too hard to hit  marisha 13 just hits good to know  matt its a big target but its pretty hardy  liam that is a one  matt one point of fire damage it hits and goes splat its less of a fire bolt and more of a  fire fizzle you see theres a patch on its rather furry belly that no longer has hair its  very glaring  liam ja i am leaning crouching against that stone hands on the wall just listening and  working on 
none	 keeping my gourd from rising  matt okay good to know jester youre up  sam go for it  laura really  sam yeah you so badly want to  laura i mean i want to so bad i want to use my spiritual weapon  matt then use it  laura okay well i will im going to hold my symbol in my hand and do like this because ive  seen caleb do fancy things and then im going to make it  matt where would you like to place it  laura right above his face 
none	  matt counting 30 is where you can make it appear  laura really close to his face  matt let me see what the range is on it whats the range on the spell  laura im looking 60  matt 60 yeah you can do it right over  laura directly in front of his face flat side facing him and then just poof  matt roll for attack go for it as jester releases her grip this giant heavylooking but  gorgeous glittering lollipop apparates out of the air streaking down towards the goblins face not  
none	 the goblin the ogres giants face its been a week  laura 16  matt 16 hits roll damage  laura that slipped out of my hand it doesnt count if it slips out of your hand ten points of  damage thats my bonus for my actual thing can i do a cantrip  matt yes you can  laura yeah im going to sacred flame him hes got to roll dexterity over 14  matt he rolled a 14 but has minus one dex  sam look at you youre a killer  laura im a monster eight 
none	 radiant damage  matt wunderbar that finishes your turn jester  laura yes the spiritual weapons right here on his face  matt you got it  ashley hes blinded now  matt now its the giants turn after being slammed in the face with this lollipop and the  flames is like angry grunting ducks out of the way as it slams down on its head grabs the side  of the pillar which breaks the pillar as it fell over shattered into four or five pieces  grabs and picks up a single piece the only one that 
none	 it paid attention to right now is the one  that lit its stomach on fire it takes this thing and lobs it in your direction  liam im behind the stone pressed to the back of it though presently correct  matt you do have cover its threequarters cover whats your armor class currently  liam it is at 14 at the moment  matt that adds plus five to your ac so its 19 on this attack thats still a 21 to hit though  so it still hits you 13 plus eight sorry  liam well bring 
none	 it on here we go  matt as this chunk of the pillar goes flying across the arena towards you it hits the top of  the wall which breaks and a good foot and a half section of it shatters as it slams into your chest  liam what did it do it did to 19 i can do a reaction cant i  matt you can  liam i cast shield  matt all right there you go as you see it slam into the wall above you and go swinging you throw  up the shield and 
none	 all of a sudden theres a spark of arcane energy as it gets deflected inches off  of the top of calebs head before slamming into the side of the actual tournament arena hitting  the stone causing it to crack and people in the front area gasp  liam what did he roll  travis and marisha 21  liam still hits because that only gets me up to 19  matt you were 19 because you had threequarters cover because you were behind the wall you had  14 plus five because you were behind  liam okay 
none	 good  matt at this moment the absolute fear kicks into his eyes the entity is going to charge forward  right at that point it stops and turns and sees out of the corner of its eye fjord hiding behind  the wall thats going to be its turn molly youre up  sam turn into water  travis blubbing sounds surprise bitches  laura whos up  taliesin im up how dumb do i feel like being  laura i feel like im already sweating  ashley i forgot to go to the bathroom im wiggling  taliesin 
none	 if its turned towards fjord then im going to run around to the opposite side of it  matt okay to there is it for flanking bonus  taliesin for flanking bonus im going to take two slices into his leg  matt go for it  laura two shots in his leg  taliesin see i didnt do it and then you just went ahead and did it im working so hard not to  do it whats the flanking bonus by the way  matt weve used it occasionally but it works against you guys as well if 
none	 you manage to get  directly across from a creature with an ally in melee you get advantage on the attack  taliesin all right so this is advantage on the attack  matt you were ranged last campaign so it didnt come into play very often  taliesin no not very often i was trying to remember im not feeling good about that one  here we are thats a 25 to hit  matt that hits  taliesin i assume i dont get the extra bonus for radiant  matt no hes not undead  taliesin counting eight 
none	 points of damage  matt eight points of damage for the first strike  taliesin then the next one is a natural 20 thats 14 points of damage  matt the first strike you carve up alongside its blubbery thick belly thats flipping over this  piece of cloth that it has matted around its midsection as you cut through it buckles a  little bit on that one side of the leg and you use that moment to cut behind its thigh right down  below where the achilles tendon is as you cut across blood spatters across the 
none	 sand and yelling  taliesin all right  matt thats your turn  taliesin yeah im holding  matt hes going to use a legendary action  laura a legendary hes legendary  matt hes a frenzied solo yeah  travis hes a frenzied solo what does that mean  matt hes going to go ahead and use his furious smash  taliesin is he going to attack me  matt hes going to attack yeah for slashing him  taliesin im definitely using blood maledict then at full use that was not good that was  bad all right 
none	 thats all right  matt okay so he has disadvantage on the attack  taliesin yeah and the next one  matt thats still a 13 plus eight  taliesin yeah that hits  matt as you slam and slice into the back of the leg he angrily turns back and swings down towards  you and his eyes go black theres a brief shake its still a massive club and you try to move out  of the way but its too fast slamming onto you knocking you onto the ground your wind is knocked  out of you 
none	 and your whole world goes dazed and white for a moment this is going to be 26 points  of bludgeoning damage  taliesin im out  sam what  travis wow fuck yes oh man  sam you wanted to  laura i underestimated the amount of damage he would do to us  matt that was a really good damage roll it reactively slams into molly with the club as the  dust settles molly is not moving on the ground probably pushed about an inch or two into the dirt  and sand theres a crater where 
none	 the head of the club had impacted and molly is not moving  liam that really hurt charlie  matt beau your turn  laura his name is charlie  marisha okay i feel like this has changed the plan that i had  sam her plan was to hit molly it was a weird plan  taliesin he has disadvantage on his next attack as well  marisha fjord i feel like i should get up there  travis im just saying this is a last man standing kind of thing  marisha youre the only one there  
none	 travis thats okay think of the team  marisha all right just this one time though im going to throw a throwing star  matt youre going to throw a throwing star okay go ahead  marisha natural 20  cheering  marisha singing happy birthday to me well that was the worlds shittiest die roll though  no wait i only get 1d4 right its just a d4 plus my bonus  matt its 1d4 times two plus your bonus  marisha okay sorry thats a better roll counting ten damage  matt okay ten damage  taliesin way 
none	 too happy about that ten damage  marisha i dont get another one right its just one action  matt no because unarmed attack its for the outside yeah  marisha okay and im going to move  matt you throw one of these spindly jagged star darts on the side you throw it through the air  and it sinks into its stomach you dont even see where it impacted except for a small red line  where its beginning to bleed from where it carved into its belly  marisha i hit him then thats it thats my 
none	 turn  matt youre going to stay there  marisha im going to stay there  matt that finishes beaus turn fjord youre up  travis im going to use my bonus action to cast hexblades curse on this giant hyuck hyuck im  going to summon my wastehunter falchion twohanded and im going to cut into his thigh  laura isnt your hex still up from the last game too  travis no it was up until the second round and then that was it  taliesin also does that mean that his reaction has been burned by the 
none	 legendary action is the  legendary action a separate thing from  matt legendary actions are different from reactions  taliesin all right so hes still got a reaction just checking  travis 25  matt that hits as the large falchion appears curved and jagged you see this splash of seawater across  the side of the giant as its eyes are now set back on fjord at this point the curse sets in the  blood spatters on the ground begin to come up into these black forms and adhere to his legs  travis 13 points of 
none	 damage plus two for the hexblades curse  matt 15 nice  travis with my speed im going to run to the north as far as 30 will carry me  laura hes going to hit you  travis i know hes going to hit me next turn anyway  matt 30 will get you there and he gets an attack of opportunity against you as you strike it in the side  and you go to run you get a fair distance but the reach with that club is just far enough where it  doesnt necessarily need it 
none	 as you go charging forward he has disadvantage because of that  that makes it a 13  travis armor class 15  matt you hear the booming from behind as it slams into the ground the earth leaves your foot  for a second and you land again you make your way to the edge well done that ends your turn that  brings us to yasha  ashley can i make it over east lets go east near his butt how far can i get  matt you can get there  laura hit him in his butt 
none	  ashley im going to hit him in the arse with the magicians judge reckless  matt reckless go for it  ashley 15  matt 15 hits  laura does that mean hes going to get advantage on you now  ashley yeah  sam but wait you get to dispel magic  ashley oh shit thats so bad  matt double ones  travis are they really double unos  ashley double unos five points of damage  matt as you go rushing by you werent paying attention for the last impact and you see out of  
none	 the corner your eye molly in the ground jammed in and unconscious bleeding out and thats just  enough being not in an enraged state to viscerally affect you and shakes you just enough  for you to swing the blade it hits the leg but it wasnt enough actual impact to carve into the flesh  ashley okay  matt that ends your turn yasha nott youre up  sam sighs do we heal or do we get this guy  travis you dont heal hit him  sam no i mean molly  travis fuck molly  sam 
none	 all right ill clock around the corner and fire off a shot  marisha he has potentially three rounds until he dies  travis i love molly but fuck  taliesin i dont  sam 20 to hit  matt that hits you can roll damage  sam okay  matt he is adjacent to yasha so it is sneak attack damage  sam ew terrible  laura oh my god whats with these rolls  ashley were going to die  laura no dont say it  ashley were going to live  sam nine points of damage  
none	 travis not as convincing  matt hey it adds up guys its cool as you duck around the corner you release the bolt it sinks  into the chest area and looks around in the direction trying to find you you still have 20 feet of  movement  marisha you dont have healing word or anything anymore  sam no im not a  laura nobody has  matt its not a rogue thing unfortunately  sam you can perform one of these mumbling use a bonus action to control the hand fuck okay i  cant cast mage

none	 sam right in the belly button  matt as it begins to thrash about its one hand hits the ground kicking up all this dust and  sand the other club comes back using it to get up off its feet it looks like its ready to swing  out towards yasha and beau whos just finished slamming into the creature at that moment you  see the exposed belly that already has gashes in it from the wound and you wait and release right  for the opening as it sinks in it stands up anyway and you watch 
none	 as blood begins to pour out  you hit something major and its starting to bleed out and it  laura i did not expect that to happen  matt takes a swing and at this point theres already blood draining out and the swing goes  wide hits the ground falls back onto its butt and proceeds to slowly go back to sleep forever  laura and travis forever  taliesin whisper shh go to sleep  sam do we win yet  matt at which point theres a pause this awkward quiet before the entire audience at once 
none	 goes  cheering  laura i use my thaumaturgy to start chanting nott nott nott nott  all except sam chanting nott nott nott nott  sam no dont draw any attention to me no dont see me no  travis i look over at caleb and say no big deal right  liam i pull my hood further down over my face  matt the cheers continue as the large goliath steps out again with his tattoos and spiked armor  and he goes there we have it the third round completion of the mighty nein but one more 
none	 fight  stands congratulations you guys are then led over to the holding area off to the side as you  pass your friends of the stubborn stock  laura i grab my spiritual weapon as were leaving and drag the giant lollipop out of the arena with me  matt leaving this large groove in the sand behind you as you guys walk by the team begins to  theres this slow motion like opposing little league baseball teams passing each other  matt marisha laura and ashley good game  matt you see darrow who gives this not 
none	 too bad well played gives a smile as he continues  past you see the dwarven crossbow ranger gives a grin with his big scruffy poof beard theres the  halfelf woman with two warhammers that shes spinning on the leather straps on the end you see  this really fucking old guy this wrinkly old prospectorlooking eyes through these wrinkled  slits hoarse greeting  travis marisha and ashley fucking old  matt i have no other way to describe him  travis old as balls  laura is his hair long or short  matt his hairs long 
none	 past his shoulders but its super bald skullet on top you see theres a  tattooed halfling whos got his chin in the air grin and give you a show and theres the human  archer that has a longbow thats at the ready all of them walk by all six of them into the center  of the arena  sam as we walk by can i try to untie the old guys shoelaces  matt make a sleight of hand check  sam 20  matt laughs he does not notice its not a shoelace unfortunately theres a 
none	 boot lace you  untie it you dont know how much of an effect it will have  travis you just killed that old man well done nott  laura they looked pretty cool  marisha they did  laura do you think we looked that cool  marisha i liked how the archer was walking around ready all the time maybe we should do that  laura yeah nott always keep your crossbow loaded  marisha yeah  sam but how will i drink  matt as you guys make your way into the holding area the doors close 
none	 once more as the goliath  jermai kull shouts out for the final match of the tournament and the final round the stubborn  stock the audience big shouts screams hands in the air then silence monster shriek the gates  on the side open as they all circle around and look ready not able to really ascertain the  direction all the gates open and then barreling through at the far side you see a large 20foot  dragonoid creature with a long snout wings that have been carved and cut to where it cannot fly  and its 
none	 lumbering forward without its flight no arms just the wings giant clawed legs and a  long tail with a large poison stinger at the end this is a wyvern a wyvern thats been prevented  flight and comes barreling straight to the center they immediately go into a formation to  accept the creature as it goes darrow rushes up with his battleaxe and starts cutting into the  creature you see this divine energy flicker off the arc as it slams into the side of this this  flash of radiant energy off of his battleaxe he pulls 
none	 away his long black ponytail swishing  behind from the arc of the blow as he ducks out of the way the tail swings and he ducks  underneath it the archer pulls back an arrow and the arrow flashes bright bluegreen energy before  it strikes and bursts into arcane energy on the side of this wyvern it turns around and grabs the  dwarf by the head and begins to thrash around with him in its jaws throwing him about ten feet he  skids to the ground falls unconscious in the first round  laura just like 
none	 you molly  matt the old armored guy pulls up a symbol from his chest and begins to chant in the wrong  direction before the halfling grabs him and spins him this way and he goes right ha and  continues his chants another weapon a spiritual weapon appears and apparates but it looks like a  large club of stone that begins to slam the wyvern spins around and its tail manages to impact  the belly of the old guy as he finishes his chant and you watch him go limp and fall to the ground  
none	 marisha guys i feel like we got the better end of the deal on this draw kind of glad im not  fighting this thing  matt the halfling with the tattoos tears his shirt down and exposes all these tattoos on his  chest and he slaps them and begins to chant in a hakastyle chant he begins to chanting as hes  doing this chant all of his allies that are standing begin to get revved up before he rushes  in and pulls a blade and strikes at the wyvern carving into its side  laura yasha 
none	 you should do that  marisha we should rip off these guys aesthetic completely  ashley i just like the idea of the formation  marisha yeah formations are cool  matt you watch as the dwarven crossbow ranger rushes up and brings the cleric back to health  the cleric comes to consciousness and then brings through a quick casting of a spell off to the  side the whats the other one there it was the  laura was the old guy the cleric  matt the old guys the one that went down and actually no the 
none	 dwarf you thought was down  actually gets back up he wasnt unconscious just knocked really hard he gets up makes sure the  cleric is up the cleric heals some people around them and they begin to curl around it they  continue to strike and back and forth the audience is breathless at moments the wyvern  jumps up on top of one of the walls its stinger spins around and jams into darrow you see darrow  the leader takes a blow to the chest and he goes unconscious on the ground before the wyvern  pounces 
none	 on him and starts tearing into the body  laura hes eating him  matt the halfling whos still continuing this chant rushes forward leaps onto its back and  begins carving at the back of its neck the elderly cleric begins approaching still chanting  in his mind and hes unleashing heal spells and occasionally throwing a bolt of energy an  electrical divine bolt of energy strikes the side of the wyvern the dwarven ranger unleashes strike  after strike of the crossbow and the wyverns hitting whatever comes near it two more of the  members go 
none	 unconscious and it gets down to just three on their side before they manage to  continue to stab into its side like a longrunning bull fighting ring both sides are  exhausted at this point three of the six are down and the wyverns still standing darrow has gotten  back up and is breathing hard he backs around the side and theyve all surrounded the wyvern whos  feeling cornered at this point blood pouring from different wounds on its body it gives another  loud shriek it turns around towards the elderly cleric and charges him and 
none	 with a giant sweep of  its jaw sends him about ten 15 feet in the air before he lands and rolls unconscious on the  ground  sam does the shoe fall off  matt theres two left the boot does dislodge and arc an additional ten feet before resting away  from  travis catching on the power line  marisha knock down the shoes  matt with that the two standing members which are darrow and the halfling both charge in the  halfling gives a pat on darrows shoulder and shouts out a phrase in a 
none	 language you dont  understand darrow seems to embolden his muscles rushes in for a strike and carves down with his  battleaxe into the back of the neck after it slammed into the cleric as the blade sinks in  about five or six inches the large battle cry that it gave shrinks back into this weird  withering screech as it whips around darrow pulls his battleaxe out and backs away a few  steps the wyvern falls to its knees and with that darrow spins the battleaxe in his hands and carves  off the rest of 
none	 its head with two three four strikes before it collapses with that  cheering  laura i use thaumaturgy to say in the audience the mighty nein are cooler still  matt chuckles the cheers are deafening at this point the gates open in front of you as the emcee  walks out once more and goes an incredible fight by the stubborn stock bring out our other  winners the mighty nein the audience goes into loud cheers you guys step out into the arena the  same crews coming out and dragging the body of the wyvern off 
town	 down into the depths of where it  was originally unleashed and the doors close behind the clerics rush out and bring to  consciousness the other members of the stubborn stock they all eventually rise beaten and  bruised and as winded as a lot of you look they give you a look as you approach and its a well  done smile wordless but a nod of respect then you to the right side of jermai kull them to the  left raise your arms for today on this harvest close you are the victors the crowd goes 
none	 crazy  once more flowers and bits of rice grain and all sorts of things are thrown into the center of the  ring in part of the celebration  laura throw some money instead  matt there are copper flung from the audience from the row you guys take that moment while  its frustrating to share it maybe you made it one of the gates on the opposite side opens up and  a group of seven individuals begin to approach in various robes you recognize a lot of them as  people that were in the lounge 
dung	 earlier before you entered this actual arena theyre carrying a  small chest of iron and dark set wood and as they place it on the ground they begin to pull out  sacks of money theyre presenting you the divided prize thats three rounds for the group and each  round was 200 gold thats 600 gold that you guys get to divide and then the final pot was 2000  divided amongst the two teams an additional 1000 to your team so 1600 gold  travis not bad  laura yeah  matt as the moneys delivered to 
none	 you you acquire your reward theres a final burst of cheers from  the audience and youre escorted back into the holding area where the other groups have already  left they close the doors behind and it seems like the fanfares over the attention on you  momentarily has faded and its just you guys the clerics and the other group the stubborn stock  laura did you say all the politicians have already left as well  matt last you saw they were up in the stands  laura oh okay okay  matt you guys just got 
none	 back to the holding area taking a breath for yourself  taliesin is there a heal spell in the house groan  matt darrow goes thats a really good question clerics the clerics say weve used most of  them but i can offer a couple they come up and they give you a heal you heal eight hit points  taliesin that helps  laura heal yasha too shes really low  matt yasha you get one and then thats a ten you heal ten then two other spells are delivered  to the opposing side the other team 
none	  laura yeah because they had a lot more people that fell actually so they probably need it  really bad  travis that was very well fought impressive  matt i appreciate that i say the same to your team that was no small feat i mean literally  it was very large feet on that gentleman  laura but a very tiny dick as was pointed out by our friend beau  matt as i heard that from across the way  marisha really he doesnt catch nuance though so  matt thats okay  marisha good to 
town	 know for next time  matt apparently giants do not suffer the same insecurities that most people in this town does  liam what happens now do we just go home after this or is there some sort of soirée afterwards  matt oh there is but in the lounge area come  liam who is invited to the party  matt well the winners of course  marisha is there free booze  matt most likely  marisha all right  matt come on  taliesin i need a drink  matt the dwarf behind you goes oh aye 
none	 i could go with that one too grunts hes holding his  back the halfelf who had the two warhammers goes oh dont worry honey scruffs his hair  he goes stop it he puts his arm around her waist and the two walk off together  travis dwarf got game  laura theyre cute together  matt youre led back to the lounge where you had originally signed up for this also the same place  where you had overheard the conversation with starosta as you enter now its still that  lowlit interior with the fine furniture cushions 
none	 the food spread has been refilled the  drinks are poured the servants are going around with their trays to make sure that everyone has  opportunity to eat and drink as you go inside however it is a little busier than the last time  you recall the starosta wyatt is there as well currently entertaining a few guests in there  theres a couple of welldressed merchants that look like theyre dressed in the same way that  many of travelers from the menagerie coast are theres one of them who looks like theyre wearing  clothing thats 
none	 a little more exotic than youre familiar with you do also see within this area  lets see here you see lawmaster orentha stonegrasp there with her gray curled hair the  older dwarven lawmaster of zadash  laura oh shes the one that we talked to before  matt briefly yeah you had one encounter with alongside her is dolan thrym and two other people  you havent met  sam marisha and laura dolan  laura the guy from the  sam our dolan  liam are they totally visible to us what are their physical appearance  
none	 matt oh the what what  liam the people that are with dolan what do they look like  matt oh they both appear to be wearing similar dull gold robes as to what youve seen members of  the kings hall wear but theyre a little more casual theyre not quite as presentory or  intheoffice mode  travis the individuals that are in the more exotic clothing than were used to what can we see of  them what do they look like  matt well theres two people dressed in merchant garb that you see the colors 
town	 and the silks and  the billowing pants and the jewellery is very reminiscent of menagerie coast where it has a lot  of finger chains that attach to rings and its this very presentory jewelry that isnt classic  european in visual aesthetic youve seen it around in town where you grew up so you gather  these people are from menagerie coast folk the one who looks very exotic has very light linen  outfit that is a dull eggshell white but then has trim that is gold and purple the pants are a  deep blue short 
dung	 black hair dark skin bright smile but you dont notice any other cultural  touchstones that you have any previous experience with  laura have i ever seen an outfit like that before  matt you may have seen things similar to it passing through your town from a distance or from  your moms place of business but nothing that you would necessarily know roll a history check  actually  sam she knows her history  laura 19  matt actually you get the sense that this is probably marquesian hes probably travelled from  marquet which is 
none	 a long way away very rare that you find people coming all the way from marquet to  the empire especially menagerie coast a little more often but this is something different as you  approach and enter the stubborn stock immediately scatter to the food and drink starosta wyatt who  you had seen briefly but not actually engaged with before stands up as tall as a halfling can as you  approach with his curly matted hair and the shocks of white and gray on the sides his arms  open and he goes congratulations i just had 
none	 to come and tell you personally a fantastic display  come closer please i want to meet all of you he starts putting hands out to meet you whats  your name  ashley hello i am yasha  matt yasha pleasure to meet you fantastic performance youre a mighty warrior im really  impressed  ashley thank you very much  matt oh you are  taliesin molly charmed  matt molly charmed good pleasure to meet you  taliesin thatll do  matt fantastic you miss  laura lady fancypants mcgee  matt thats a curious name

none	 have been made the  towers back where it was the individuals you probably want to talk to about that are over there  in the corner they were faced away from you when you first entered but looking out from the far  window that leads to the outside you see two figures faced away looking outward holding  glasses of wine it looks to be the two figures you saw when you first entered the ring oremid  hass the headmaster of the zauber spire or the halls of erudition  laura then the dude in the white 
none	 robes  matt the dude in the white robes  marisha oh shit  liam they were the two that were just pointed out to all of us  matt yes they were just facing away from you guys wyatt fedar says if you want to enquire  the specifics theyd be the ones to talk to i will say ive recently been notified by  stonegrasp he points over to the lawmaster whos in conversation on the side with her own  people that you had already completed some dangerous contract work for the city is that  correct 
none	  travis thats indeed true yeah we found ourselves in harms way were always looking for  the next bit of adventure to put some coin in our pockets and do the city some good  matt thats fantastic  laura we beat a spider  matt thats the one she mentioned that thing had been a problem for some time i hear so its  greatly appreciated youve done twice now a great service for this city well this evening is  yours to celebrate things shifting as they are we may have need of upstanding and skilled  
none	 citizens of the empire such as yourselves in the near future should you be interested that is  laura is everything okay starosta you seem rather stressed im good at spotting these things  matt i appreciate that my position here comes with a number of responsibilities so at any given  point in time im probably am very visibly stretched but im doing the best i can i  appreciate that where might we contact you should we be so interested  travis well were frequently at the what the name was the  laura the leaky tap

none	 freely you know  liam through the gates  matt oh well thats not a worry i dont think simon hits the side of the chair and one of the  crownsguard comes up but a more decorated crownsguard looks like he holds more status and  he goes yes starosta he looks about and says can we ensure that the rest of your body of  soldiers understand that these fine champions of this years harvest close festival are allowed  entry and exit from our fine trispires hes like yes sir we will make sure that the  
none	 crownsguard are aware of the mighty nein and their ability to pass in and out unimpeded  travis most gracious of you  laura thank you so much what is your name  matt oh im jeremiah captain jeremiah im anyway well done well fought he takes a step  back out of the conversation and you get the sense that theres a little bit of a hierarchy there  where the starosta not meaning to but theres a very much i should not be part of this  conversation and he steps out of it well very well look 
none	 enjoy your wellearned evening of  revelry as much as you can i have a sense there are some stressful days ahead so enjoy it rest  well takes his glass and drinks to you  sam to a better tomorrow  matt indeed young girl he turns around and sits up on the couch and reengages in  conversation with one of his various guests  travis he certainly seems stressed  sam hes going to die tomorrow in war  travis what  sam we all are  travis what are you talking about  sam didnt i 
town	 tell you guys theres a war starting tomorrow  travis did you  sam i overheard them yes  laura she did tell us  sam were all going to die we should leave now  laura were not going to die the war is very far away from us  taliesin i cant believe i find myself agreeing with nott here we should get out of town while  its still possible  travis really were just starting to climb our way up through this thing  taliesin you leave the table when youve got the pot you dont 
none	 wait for everything to go back to  the dealer  liam i think for a day or two everyone here is going to be very preoccupied in the city if there  is anything you are thinking of doing it would be a good time to do it  laura we should steal everything  taliesin at some point theyre going to start looking for people to fight this war and im not  sure i want to be around for it because boy they know who we are now  liam what i am suggesting is a compromise

town	 were all going to go right  travis sure yeah ill join you jester  laura you want me to come too  taliesin i actually think maybe it should be her and beau because they wont recognize her and  human faces tend to blend into the crowd whereas we do not  laura i can listen to the starosta  travis fair enough  liam i am already hanging out by the door to this place i left 30 seconds ago  ashley wait but i was actually kidding  taliesin im not  laura youll be great 
none	 yasha  sam just ask them about what happened the other night and the crick that they killed  taliesin remember how we talked about getting you out in the world more and then you said you  didnt want to but then we said youre going to have to do it anyway  ashley i know but  taliesin this is those times  ashley sighs okay  marisha come on lets go make asses out of ourselves  taliesin shell take care of you  laura ask about the xhorhasian that they fought and then ask them how 
none	 they do so much cool magic  then ask them  sam who they work for we know who they work for what do we need from them  marisha names information  travis what are they worried about  marisha where are they going to fight are they going to roll out people  laura ask them how they fly  sam oh why dont you just act like you know more than you do like gruff voice whoa i hear  wars coming tomorrow what about that  travis if were going to help the city the more 
none	 we know the better  taliesin lets not even start making vague promises just be yourself and youll  be fine just be anybody but yourself and youll be fine its going to be great  marisha what was that about making promises  travis as they start walking over im going to wide flank to the left  matt wait so whos going where  marisha me and yasha are going to go talk to the wizards  matt beau and yasha are going there  laura youre not going to go too  travis no these two  
town	 laura oh jeez im going to constantly stay within a few feet of the starosta but not in like  a weird way i just want to like overhear his conversations and see if hes talking about war  and stuff  travis id like to flank to the left and keep an eye on the crowd to see if anybody pays attention  to two strangers approaching  matt okay it seems that the cluster of merchants that he had originally mentioned are keeping  pretty close to the starosta theyre probably in the business of discussing future transactions 
none	 and  business you gather probably more on the starosta making connections in preparation for whats about  to transpire  liam is it really crowded in here are there a lot of people  matt theres about 20 or so people in the chamber the chambers maybe about 40 feet by 40  feet its fairly packed  liam i am going to send frumpkin dancing around peoples feet to follow yasha and beau and take a  seat in a chair on the side of the room as close to the door as possible  matt you find 
none	 a chair everyone seems to be standing and conversing  marisha its okay fjords been teaching me how to talk to people  ashley do you want to take the lead  marisha sure i walk up to orenid hass oremid  matt theyre both faced away and theyre looking out theres a window thats open that leads out  into the main victory pit and then theres the sky which is mostly clouds occasionally you see  a break with some stars theyre in the middle of a conversation but its hushed  marisha i grab yasha behind on 
dung	 the small of her back i walk her up to the window and im like  yeah and theres actually a really great view  matt they both immediately stop and turn over to look at you  ashley i cant even imagine the beauty  marisha right its such a great view over there is the cobalt soul  matt pardon me can we help you you glance over and you can see oremid hass at first  glance squat maybe fivefootthree but a wide body like wolverine proportions very dark ruddy  brown skin with eyes that are 
none	 black like obsidian that sparkle when you look at them the hair is  very short and curled and theres this very strongly inset dimple wrinkle when he smiles with  teeth that are dull gray in color theres something not quite human about him but also very  welcoming as he turns towards you theres a bit of dust that is loosened from the edges of his  ears and it air puffing its a strange phenomenon with long reddishgold robes his arms  are folded in the sleeves where you cant see them he says i apologize weve 
none	 taken time away  from the window the other gentleman turns towards you and you can see now very close an  older gentleman probably 70s or so skin slightly jaundiced or yellowed in color versus the usual  pigmentation here bald on top but longer graywhite hair that goes past the shoulders the  same white and gold robes he smiles but he looks like hes not enjoying the pleasantries of the  space but then puts on a face as soon as he notices your arrival and gives a nod i recognize  both of you you were 
none	 part of this fight ordeal the mighty nein correct  marisha we were i recognize you too i feel like weve met before maybe at a gala  previously  matt its possible i do not recall but if so it is good to see you again im sorry  marisha beau  matt beau i am oremid hass i am the headmaster of the halls of erudition this is my compatriot  master trent ikithon  marisha trent ikithon  matt he turns and goes it is a pleasure to meet you i saw what you did today as 
none	 well it was a  very majestic display of skills quite  ashley thank you very much  marisha majestic is my middle name we saw the other day you guys fighting off those invaders  that was very impressive thank you so much for your service to the city  matt oremid goes to raise his hand and trent goes oh so you were present during the attack  outside of the zauber spire ja  marisha well i mean it was pretty public towers are tall  matt well it was an unfortunate incident that thankfully we were 
none	 present both of us to take  care of it before it grew too dangerous  ashley what were you fighting  matt that seemed to be assassins sent by the kryn dynasty terrible cricks that had attempted to  steal something that should not fall into their hands  ashley the kryn dynasty they are from northern xhorhas  matt that is correct he gives you a look over like hes inspecting you with a very rapid and  very detailed intake of your features and he goes where are you from if i might ask  sam abort 
none	 abort abort  ashley i am from  matt where did you grow up  ashley xhorhas  matt how long have you lived here in the empire  ashley not very long about lets see maybe eight months or something  marisha that doesnt look good no  matt fascinating  marisha she travels and has helped  matt trent isnt even looking at you hes completely focused on yasha  ashley i travel i left stammers i chose not to live there anymore  matt why did you leave  ashley i just you know its not a 
none	 great place to live its awful its marsh and its not a  comfortable place to live  matt make a wisdom saving throw for me real fast  all ooh  laura wisdom saving throw he just did zone of truth on you  taliesin wow that was cocked  laura super cocked  sam super cock  ashley seven because i have a negative  matt as youre talking its weird hes staring at you but for a moment you feel like theres an  illusion over his mouth and his fingers theyre still not moving but its 
none	 almost like your eyes  catch something shifting unseen beneath them its almost like youve layered two images over each  other for a brief second then theyre gone and he goes huh well very happy to have you  fighting on our side  ashley yes i most definitely am i can assure you i dont stand for anything bad from the  xhorhas and i am here to help  matt wonderful maintain that please  ashley okay  matt you and your friends seem to be very helpful and a lot of help may be needed should

none	  marisha no i am cobalt soul yeah super proud of the work were doing over there  matt you have done much great work and have aided us on many occasions  marisha everyone at the cobalt soul feels the same about you all at the halls of erudition  matt oremid hass actually laughs and he goes laughs look i know that there have been  tensions in the past but complete honesty i really appreciate what you do over there  marisha thank you  matt anyway we must be off the evening has grown late isnt 
none	 that correct trent goes yes  that is correct its been a pleasure i look forward to our paths crossing again  ashley great same here because this was great conversation  marisha one last question oremid the cobalt souls been talking about moving to the front  line do you have any idea if were going to get the same support from the hall of erudition  because i know youre a fan of our work and were such a mutual fan of yours  matt to the front line of what  ashley ah you know  matt 
none	 we train a good number of war mages yes some of our finest will be present at bladegarden  and beyond should things escalate any further im sure a number of our circle will also join  where its necessary  marisha beautiful  matt you have my word and the word of the assembly  marisha cobalt souls got your back too  ashley but to be clear do you know what youre fighting  matt they both have a knowing look at each other and look back to you trent casts forward and  says we have been 
none	 studying for quite some time as is the nature of protecting our people here  yes but there are still many mysteries beyond the boundaries why is there something you know that  we dont  ashley just if youre fighting i just wanted to know if you were fighting the kryn  matt very much so they have killed many of our people the skies to the east darken and we want  to keep that darkness from spreading we wish the sun to continue to rise on this empire and  currently it does not over the ashkeeper 
none	 peaks  ashley i wish you the best of luck  matt thank you if youre ever near rexxentrum find me i would like to continue this  conversation  ashley okay  matt oremid hass speaks up and goes all right well anyway a wonderful night to you all rest  well congratulations and well fought  travis dm can i ask is his name trickatickatingtong what was his name  matt trent ikithon ikithon  laura oh i spelled it right  matt youre welcome  sam i ran a halfikithon once  travis boo  ashley where 
none	 did he say we could meet up  travis rexxentrum  ashley rexxentrum  matt rexxentrum yeah  travis which is where the soltryce is  marisha rexxentrum soltryce academy  matt they exit and you watch as oremid halfway through the room as he has his arms folded goes  oh my goodness look at you and gets down and starts going towards frumpkin and is like well  how did you get in here  marisha oh my god hes got a weakness  matt he begins reaching for  liam hass or ikithon  matt no oremid 
none	 hass immediately goes down and goes from this completely wellestablished  presentary persona to this childlike wonder of this cat hes like come here  please i would like to touch on you  liam im taking all this in first person  matt yep  marisha lets remember this for later  travis my whiskers  liam thats all i can take i get out of it  matt okay you pull out of it and you watch as oremid actually picks up frumpkin and holds him in  his hand and starts petting him like coos they both 
none	 continue to walk towards the exit  liam i lean forward and look at the ground  matt okay as they exit the chamber oremid outside goes ahead and sets frumpkin down and  pets his head for a moment go on dont get stuck inside they both leave and exit into the night  taliesin that looked like it went well how bad was it  sam what information did you glean  marisha man yashas super honest  sam why what happened  marisha super forthcoming  ashley i figured its like one of those things that if 
none	 youre going to get caught you might as  well tell the truth because its easier to remember i dont know i panicked  travis well did you say anything you didnt want to  ashley i dont think so did i say anything that was bad  marisha i dont think so  liam maybe where you are from and how short a time you have been here  ashley oh i said both of those things  taliesin you said both of those things  liam yes you did  marisha you definitely made it seem like she 
none	 could be a xhorhasian spy definitely there to  potentially kill them in fact i think thats exactly what they thought might have been  happening  liam yeah but you also dropped a horse apple in front of them as well  marisha yeah it was kind of great  travis whatd she do  liam she mentioned a little insight on the pending war when no one knows about the pending war  marisha i think theyre going to look at you as a good resource i think thats what you revealed  yourself as  ashley either 
none	 that or they think that im a xhorhasian assassin and i am not  marisha what the fuck is the kryn though  sam the kryn is the kingdom over there  travis kryn  ashley its the kryn dynasty  marisha oh the kryn  laura kryn is the empress of the drow you guys  travis the green is something else  laura im not here im next to starosta  taliesin it didnt devolve into a punching fest thats pretty good  laura is the starosta still here  matt the starosta is still here yes  
none	 laura okay im still there  matt make a perception check  marisha i was envisioning a big evil monster  laura 20  matt okay you overhear the gist of most of the conversation best you can without catching too  much attention to yourself over the next 20 minutes or so you catch what amounts to them  discussing possible future difficulty in crossing border boundaries between the empire the  menagerie coast and imports the necessity of them but having to make sure they go through very  stringent processes in doing so with the promise of 
none	 coming conflict he doesnt outright say that  theyre at war yet but the starosta is essentially laying the groundwork for maintaining  trade lines through the wuyun gorge across the cyrios mountains wanting to make sure that the  port towns of the menagerie coast still have access to get the necessary goods to the empire  not only to maintain their people but to get them as quickly as possible to the front to the east  travis right allies  matt yeah theyre trying to basically establish what initially seemed like it may have  been a 
none	 pleasantry based arrival on their part they have been pulled into this conversation with  the starosta out of necessity from his standpoint you can sense theres a bit of desperation in his  voice hes generally trying to do the best job he can and feels overwhelmed in the moment and is  trying as best he can to cover it  sam yasha just so we know and can i trust you but if theres anything that we need to know now  would be a good time to tell us so that were not in danger are 
none	 you a xhorhasian spy come here to  do bad things to the empire  ashley no  taliesin oh my god youve discovered why shes been with my circus all this time working as a  bouncer  sam well why are you here then why did you flee  ashley well i dont know if that is any of your business at this time  sam well i want to know in case theyre going to come try to kill you and kill me by accident  taliesin if they try and kill you to get answers then 
none	 this way you dont know anything then  youre really not worth anything  travis plausible deniability  sam plausimonamonaminity  travis there was an m in there that wasnt supposed to be  plausible demiability  liam and taliesin sea anemone sea anemone  sam i just want to know if youre on their side or the xhorhasian side so that when this war  comes that were not caught in the crossfire thats all  taliesin what side are you on  sam im on my side  taliesin exactly  ashley im not on any side but 
dung	 i do think what we are fighting is something very terrible  sam you mean what theyre fighting  ashley yeah  sam in xhorhas  ashley yeah  sam the kryn  ashley yeah i mean we heard about them in the north and theyre mostly dark elves that settled  in a massive ruin that was completely forbidden for us to travel to  sam did they do bad things to your people  ashley yeah the ones that went there they do keep their skies dark its some kind of dark  magic that we dont know 
dung	 of that keeps the sun away theyve enslaved men and beasts and demons  under their banner  sam that sucks  marisha have you seen the dark skies  ashley ive never been there because its hard to get there and its not someplace i would want to  go alone  sam did you know anyone who went  ashley ive heard stories but never anybody personally  travis are you interested in going there  ashley ive always been curious just to see with my own eyes but theyve done so many bad things  that i 
none	 would want to fight them  marisha i think mollys right i think molly and nott are right i think theyre going to try and  start enlisting soldiers here are they doing the same where youre from  ashley i dont know  liam during this whole talking i look in and see where my cat is  matt frumpkin is maybe 20 feet outside the door and is waiting for you guys to exit  liam okay i tell him to wait there for me  matt okay  travis if were really going to be pulling out 
none	 of this city that fast haha maybe we should take  advantage of these new badges we have and hit up the trispires  taliesin finish the evening off right ill honestly say id like to get out of here as soon  as possible so they dont think were running from the news we get out of here before the news hits  travis fair enough all at once  marisha where do we go  taliesin i dont care im just happier moving than staying still  liam how quickly are you thinking  taliesin if it were 
town	 just the two of us id say leave tonight but  liam how about 24 hours from now  taliesin see if we can make it faster but 24 hours is not terrifying  travis dusk tomorrow  taliesin no later than dusk i would like to get out before news starts to spread before they  decide to start locking down the holes  liam yeah one more day just to get supplies and get ready for the road again  taliesin thats a fair point  sam should we divide up the money  marisha yes  travis 
none	 i believe thats 228 gold each  sam great  matt as you guys are in the process of finishing this up and people are starting to leave from the  lounge area and theyre starting to close down darrow comes up with his troupe theyre a ways  into their cups and hes like friends before we shove off and probably never meet again i just  wanted to say its been an absolute pleasure to get to meet you to watch you fight for you to  watch us fight all the luck in your future endeavors  
none	 travis same to you it was very impressive where does fate take you after this night  matt well as far as i know were probably heading back up to nogvurot and continuing with  our contract of sitting around and being paid for nothing  travis is that remind me again north of here northwest  matt northeastish east of rexxentrum thats where weve been stationed for the past six or  seven months or so done a few jobs here and there  travis is this a contract that keeps on going or is there any set end 
none	 date for you guys  matt no not until they cancel it  travis man that is rough weve been hearing little murmurs of action what direction is it  sam east  travis east of here  matt like over on the border with xhorhas  travis indeed trouble stirring up you hear anything about that  matt other than the fact that there have been incursions and kidnappings and stuff its all  been small and localized within the borders but bladegardens there for a reason and  talonstadt  travis since youre familiar with that trip back 
none	 and forth anything you would recommend us  checking out just in case we decided to wander for a bit  matt laughter what are you looking for  travis i dont know a good time a bit of adventure maybe a bit of both  matt hm a good time to be perfectly honest if youre looking for wining dining and various  nightly pleasures my faith does not allow for that so im a very bad source but and he turns  around  liam i think what my friend is talking about is can you recommend any 
dung	 good ways to get into  trouble  matt oh legal trouble or illegal trouble  liam what you will  matt if youre going to go illegal you can actually go just beyond the boundaries of the  empire to shadycreek run entire haven for murderers thieves and all sorts of strange  people  travis maybe if its not so gnarly  matt there is deastok to the west as well as kamordah theres quite good drink in kamordah  theres prides call if you like the jovial dwarvenfolk there much less dark and intense as  grimgolir 
none	 because theyre right on the boundary and most of them are fighting for the war as well  personally rexxentrums got it all  travis we hear that soltryce academy is located there as well  matt yeah that it is  travis do you know anybody thats graduated from that academy  matt not privately no like i said ive only been here for about a little over a half a year  to me its not been too bad  travis fair enough well i wish you the best  matt you as well my friends drink deep 
none	 play hard  travis indeed same to you  laura id like to stop the starosta before he leaves the room  matt okay you do notice as darrow leaves he does have a medallion around his neck that  previously was hidden under his armor it is the symbol of the dawnfather  laura its the legal thing after oh no its not  matt the dawnfathers legal here  laura the dawnfather is legal here  matt as the rest of the folk are exiting out you guys have basically waited to close down the  party most 
none	 of the servants are cleaning up and finishing up the space the starosta begins to  leave and make his way out there with his companions and theyre chatting  marisha i drink all the leftover drinks that people left behind  matt classiest classy  sam i have limitless alcohol  laura may i have a moment of your time before you leave  matt oh yeah of course jester  no you told him it was fancypants  laura fancypants yes  travis mcgee  matt fancypants mcgee  laura yes  matt right right yes

none	 people would  marisha like the public libraries of today  liam right youre a librarian  matt kind of yeah people know it exists but the few people that really take an  interest in it either end up pursuing it or adjacently to it those people end up acquiring  more knowledge and end up becoming more prominent in the society its almost an unused resource  unfortunately  liam their political affiliation  matt within the empire theyre one of the many sanctioned places of worship for the knowing  mistress but theyre with the empire they 
dung	 function within the empire and the individuals  that run each archive are appointed by the crown as with all places of worship in the kingdom  whoever helms those locations the high priest the high archivist whoever they are they are  appointed by the crown and work directly for the empire all religion here is employed by the  empire at the highest point  taliesin so long as theres a cobalt soul scholastic fair really  laura gasps scary stories to tell in the dark  marisha yes i want my pencil set  matt thats after

none	 panicked exhale i really thought there was going to be more money in here  sam did you tell her that you were out of money  laura i did i did tell her that  sam and this is all she sent  laura but you know what thats totally fine 200 gold is really generous of her  sam maybe i dont know your mother maybe she was testing the postal system sending a small  amount as a test you can write back and say got it safely feel free to send more  laura thats a 
none	 really good idea  sam maybe that was it because i wouldnt want to send 5000 gold over the mail system theres  people out there who steal the mail  travis laughter whoosh imitates dramatic music  marisha you made an incredibly excellent point it is so easy to defraud the mail  ashley plus 200 gold is a lot of money thats more than i pretty much have right now  laura it is a lot of money  taliesin its more than we used to make in a year easily  marisha its a lot to send

none	 absolutely right away whatever you want but why  marisha is the secret that valuable  liam i am going to tell you the story of how i murdered my mother and father  sam oh  liam when i was younger i grew up in a small township outside of rexxentrum called blumenthal  my mothers name was una my fathers name was leofric everyone was very excited about me when i  was young i was bright and confident people used to say that i glided through life and everything  just worked for me as i got 
town	 older it became clear that i had a knack for the arcane everyone  talked about this soltryce academy maybe i would go there someday the way they do things at that  academy they dont take all comers they look for the diamond in the rough and every couple of years  they find one but when i was a young man adolescent really they found three of us  another boy and a girl and  sam from your town  liam ja from blumenthal and we were accepted  sam how old were you  liam i 
none	 was young  marisha whats young teenager  liam yeah anyway we went there i studied for a year i worked so hard it came easier to me than  the other two but they were also very accomplished there were other students from other  parts of the empire there and a little over a year of learning all they had to impart i met a  man named trent ikithon he became our teacher  marisha why didnt you say anything earlier  liam earlier when earlier tonight earlier a week ago what do you mean  marisha 
none	 when we were talking to trent you know we were talking to trent  liam after a year of studying in the main school trent handpicked all three of us again and we  left the school proper and went with him to a home out in the countryside where he trained us it was  a good time we believed in the empire we were going to keep it strong he was cruel he hurt us  a lot made us go through extreme circumstances but we got strong i also fell in love but thats  another story 
none	  marisha one of the other students  liam yeah we rose through the ranks and it was the empire over all and eventually he wanted to  test our allegiance so strangers were brought in traitors disgusting people traitors to  this empire and we killed them  sam you were just students  liam mmhmm  marisha he made you executioners  liam we wanted to be  marisha caleb thats deeply fucked up you know that right  liam yeah a few months of studying of a little bit of torture a little bit of murdering  
none	 dissidents and traitors and deviants  marisha then one day your parents are brought in as traitors no  liam no we were ready to graduate and the last test of our allegiance was im getting ahead of  myself i went on a trip home and visited my parents and when i was there in the middle of the  night i awoke and overhead them talking and went to the stair and listened to them talk about  revolution and tearing the empire down and i felt disgraced and shame for my family my mother and  my 
none	 father who were so wonderful to me when i was a child and were so happy for me to go to the  academy and believe in the empire so much i went back to the school and when the three of us  were summoned and told what was expected of us i knew what had to be done we went to this other  boys home first eodwulf and we stood by as he killed his parents we went to astrids house and  had dinner with them and she poisoned them then we went to my home 
none	 and we grabbed a horse cart  and in the middle of the night placed it against the door to the home and i set it on fire  marisha you had to do this to graduate to prove your loyalty  liam well yeah but it didnt exactly go according to that plan because as soon as i heard  my mother and father screaming inside i was so sure i was so sure until i wasnt and i broke a bit  sam did you go in after them  liam no i went to an asylum for 
none	 a number of years i broke i dont remember so well what  happened to me there it was quite a number of years years later a woman was there and she  another patient put hands on me and she took the clouds away she took it all away and not just my  madness but the fake memories that ikithon put in my head of my parents  sam fake memories  liam wanting to betr yes  sam wait there was a false memory he tricked you  marisha into hearing their talks against the empire is 
none	 that what it was  liam yes but it doesnt matter because i still wanted to do it when i did it  sam but you didnt know what you were doing  liam so what  sam you were brainwashed  liam so what  sam programmed  liam doesnt matter i should have im a disgusting person it doesnt matter anyway all  that gone just like that i ran not right away i pretended like nothing had changed for several  weeks she was stark raving mad 15 minutes later herself the woman who helped me i 
none	 killed one of  trents people there and took this i pull out the necklace this has been keeping me hidden for  years for five years  sam what do you mean hidden  liam they can find who they want but not with this they cannot find me i would really like to  get into that library because i would  marisha like to run again  liam hmm no i like you all  marisha you were just talking with nott about running tomorrow  liam well that all depends on you beauregard  marisha if 
none	 i dont let you in  liam if you can keep a secret  marisha caleb im good at keeping secrets you heard us talking to trent you know he wants  yasha and youre the only person who knows the atrocities that this man who utterly gave me the  creeps by the way so im feeling a little bit validated in the fact that i read him pretty well  sam i dont think its  liam anyway  marisha im just saying you have a responsibility now  liam which is  marisha keep this guy from 
none	 hurting more people  liam well thats precisely why i want into this library  marisha you want to take down trent is that why youre doing all this you want to take down trent  liam among other things  marisha ah what are you hoping to find  liam anybody can make lights anybody could send a message through a wire i want to bend reality  to my will  marisha caleb you dont though no one wants that amount of power and responsibility  liam yeah well i told you why i am afraid of fire 
none	 so you are going to bring me to that  library  marisha dont worry ill take you to the library there are two options here you can  selfishly try and go after this guy for your own vendetta or you can use your motives to keep  others from getting hurt in a very similar way  liam both of those are appealing to me  marisha all right i know you just make dancing lights or at least you can feel like you just  make dancing lights but those dancing lights make sure i can punch 
none	 people in the fucking face  whenever i cant see shit a little bit of teamwork goes a long way  liam okay good i think nott and i are going to retire now maybe you can go get that food for the  others  marisha cool man cool kick me out of the room i get it yep all right  sam you want to stay here  marisha no i mean you just dumped some heavyass shit like that and then ask me to leave  no i get it its fine  liam yeah  marisha

town	 i mean i trust my own ears theyre  very large but i barely heard half of a conversation i dont even know really whats  happening other than i heard that theres a war happening  taliesin whats the good side of this then whats your bestcase scenario  sam well maybe we should do some snooping around town and find out if there indeed is a war before  we leave town  taliesin if they lock the gates or start conscripting  laura will they do that  taliesin i dont know what theyd do all i 
none	 know is i dont want to hang out and obviously weve  made a bit of a reputation for ourselves  laura but then any city we go into wont they lock us in that city  sam we also have allies here we have the gentleman  laura gasp  taliesin hes an ally now  laura you know what we should do you guys why dont we talk to dolan about it he would tell us  sam dolan we havent even checked in with him  marisha oh shit we forgot to check in with him

none	 well  go to nogvurot  sam because those are funnysounding names  laura no because hupperdook is a funny sounding name then nogvurot is where our friends  from the other mercenary group live  sam its also where there was a string of kidnappings  marisha yeah  taliesin see that sounds like our speed not conscripting into fighting on the front lines  laura we can disguise you as a kid and they could kidnap you and you could fight them from the  inside  sam i dont like this idea  travis how about we 
none	 go say hi to dolan well run by the gentleman let him know that were thinking  about bouncing and then well be on our way  ashley may i take a look at that map jester  laura of course yasha  marisha does anyone know who funds the victory pit  travis im sure its the city right  marisha probably  laura we could ask dolan about that too  marisha yeah  taliesin dont think they dont know our names now  laura can i say that while it was last night i painted a picture 
none	 with the new paint for my mom  matt sure  laura im going to ask the front desk if they will send it to her back to our house in the  menagerie coast  matt yeah theyre less paints and more colored inks you can purchase paints wherever you want  to but these are like  laura i mean i have paints i guess  matt but you have paints to do it  laura okay ill paint it with the stuff i have  matt you paint her a little picture  laura ooh colored inks 
town	 i didnt realize that  marisha gel pens  matt clicking  laura ooh  matt postage for sending it off is simple enough at that size to be about five silver from here to  nicodranas  laura okay  taliesin i think we should be careful because the longer were in town the more people we talk  to the more people might decide that theyre invested in us staying  travis fair enough well keep our eyes open to dolans then  matt to dolans first  travis yeah  marisha you guys go to dolans you 
none	 want to take a field trip  liam yeah  travis where are yall going  liam we have to take a trip to pumats for supplies and then  travis insight check just kidding im good  matt all right whos going where  marisha i go wherever caleb goes  sam me too  liam pumat library  matt pumat library the rest of you guys are going to dolans  taliesin to dolans well meet up at pumats  marisha okay that sounds good you guys dolans well go library  liam well do library first then

town	 gray what little bits of sunlight came through the last  day have completely absconded the sky is covered in gray nearly stormy clouds there is an air of  stress and question in the streets as you start seeing righteous brand groups making their way  through as you make your way through the north side of the pentamarket one of the town criers  comes by shouting war declared on the kryn by the king in retribution of attack on eastern  garrisons  travis oh shit  matt another one a few moments later further down the 
none	 way shouts out righteous brand  mobilizing east to protect our families spare what provisions you can to ensure victory and  support our defenders there are clusters of righteous brand groups the full armored military  outside of the signet wall that have come into the streets and are basically picking up provisions  asking for donations from anyone that can spare things for this scenario theyre grabbing horses  from nearby stables and it seems like since the close of the festival through the night and into  the morning preparations have already kicked in on the military 
none	 side  travis maybe not to dolans then  laura why  travis because we got to get the fuck out of here  laura well are we still all together or are we already split up  matt youre already split up  laura theres no way well be able to get out of here before  marisha back to pumats  taliesin were going to do our best were going to see how its going to be  liam did we hear that though  marisha im assuming we all heard it as we split  matt you 
none	 heard bits of it as you split off you guys heard a bit it says crick incursion  threatening imperial borders the starosta recommends armed escorts for travel across the  valley a lot of these righteous brand soldiers are also saying goodbye to their families theres  a lot of people in big embraces with their children or with their parents and theres very  much the air of the morning before the big shift begins the crownsguard themselves are doing the  best to keep the peace and inform people and not keep individuals from freaking out as 
none	 much but  you do see a few arguments breaking out in the streets and theres that general tension of  whats happening whats going on how bad is this but everything seems relatively under  control the signet wall which is to the north side of the city which is where all the military  is usually situated you dont have a view beyond the wall of course but you can see thats where  a large part of the righteous brand is emerging into the city from yeah there is a definite  building presence and tension in 
none	 the city in preparation for the shift eastward you guys are  heading to dolans still  laura are we still  matt or what are you doing  laura i mean its obvious were at war now theres not much to talk to him about huh  travis thats what i mean  laura maybe we should see if we should be some armed guards for some rich people going across the  valley before so that we have you know  taliesin just a thought to check the board also get our stuff from the leaky tap  
town	 laura yeah thats what we can do while theyre at the library  travis yeah  ashley thats a good idea  matt you guys are heading back to the leaky tap  laura were going to go by the board first the job board  matt oh the taskboard  laura to see about being armed guards and then were going to go to the  taliesin possible private escorts private escort either north or  marisha might be our best way out of town actually good idea  matt okay you guys head to the taskboard outside of 
none	 the kings hall the four of you theres the  original posting seeking or paying for any information on myriad or unlawful activity within  the city theres the reward on rebel gatherings anticrown rhetoric that youve seen there is a  shift to the recent righteous brand convincing letter it says war has found our doorstep  defend your family from the xhorhasian hordes by sword or shield good pay and adventurous living  as a soldier of the righteous brand seek leopold wanstiker at the marrow keep in the signet wall  the other proof of others worship 
none	 of heretical gods paid in gold you dont see any immediate  postings for armed guards but those are probably done privately through the merchant guilds  however as youre looking at the board a voice goes oh well thats perfect you see  voloshin the keeper of the hall who you had previously interfaced with when you did your job  in the sewers comes out in his robes and he says wed actually sent a page to look for you but  they mustve missed you the lawmaster wishes to speak with you would you come with me 
none	  travis of course  laura yeah of course we will  taliesin sure  matt providence it is enter please he leads you inside the hall of the king and there are the  two archways between the clerks center and the lawbearers small shrine within the chamber he  leads you down the right hallway past two sets of doors and theres a third door on the right that  is partially ajar as you enter it you see a spacious if rather minimalistic chamber its a  bare chamber beyond a bookcase the desk with a long 
dung	 bench in front of it and a series of three  small windows where the sunlight comes through or the light theres not really sunlight at the  moment because of the weather beyond that its white marble and fairly empty there at the desk  you see her arms sprawled looking down over clusters of parchments the lawmaster orentha  stonegrasp her gray hair has tumbled past her shoulders and her bangs have been pulled back like  a natural circlet keeping it out of her eyes he pushes you into the chamber she has a dark brown fur 
dung	  robe on the cold morning air makes the room especially the dark marble very cold she keeps  it on for warmth she looks up from the papers and greets you with a smile and goes thank you for  coming that was mighty fast have a seat if you dont mind thank you voloshin close the door  if you could of course my dear he closes the door leaves you in there i wasnt expecting  such a rapid response but i appreciate your expediency  laura well we were right here  matt thats fantastic please 
none	 have a seat id like to discuss a few things with you if you dont  mind first off congratulations yesterday that was quite a display and a fantastic victory well  laura are we going to war  matt i see you are aware of the shifts in our current imperial state of affairs we havent had  war in generations im hopeful that the conflict is swift but ill leave that concern to those  with the right expertise im tasked with keeping my people safe here not on the front here now  wartime puts us in 
none	 an unfortunate scenario zadash effectively governs the southern half of the  empire and most of military might is now leaving us our crownsguard will be stretched thin across  keeping the peace and dealing with unrest and worry and protecting these walls from whatever  pushes through the lines of battle and the general things that wander from beyond our boundaries  money isnt an issue but personnel is there are outlying threats and criminals we no longer have  the manpower for and as such the crown has approved an expanded mercenary budget now youve  already proven 
none	 your ability to me twice most recent your skills in the victory pit showing you  capable and loyal to the king i know not your interest but if you would come under contact  under my office as legionnaires of the empire you would be responsible for protecting the lives of  many innocent people now under contract you would receive 15 gold a week per person as  a stipend whether or not you were on contract or not it could be at your leisure months at a time  with no work and you still get paid 
none	 no matter what you do each assignment rewards its own bounty of  course case by case the work ill be presenting would largely involve the hunting of outstanding  criminals the acquisition of resources that may benefit the empire in this time of war and  sometimes the extermination of dangerous creatures that threaten life away from the front lines now  youd all have credentials within the empire and that will grant you access to supplies pro bono  access to empirical halls and individuals otherwise restricted to the general populace  laura would we get healing potions 
none	  matt when theyre available those supplies are a bit stretched thin and put toward the front  lines we could probably muster what we can could i hope for your help on this  travis thats quite the offer seem to be opening up the whole kit and caboodle for us here  matt dire times make for dire circumstances we dont take lightly the ask that were giving here  travis we understand your position unfortunately you find us in a precarious time as you can see  we dont have all of our fellows here with us 
none	 and this mornings news caught us unawares wed need  a fair bit of time to consider your offer im afraid we cant give you a yes or no right now  matt i understand thats fine she smiles lightly the crows nests in her eyes folding in a  bit i hold no grudge against you should you decline thats all  laura we do appreciate the offer and we cant wait to talk to our friends about it though  matt okay  sam insight check  matt well should you be interested the first contract i can 
none	 discuss if you choose to sign with  us it does offer a 10000 gold bounty  sam choking  laura what is it  matt i cant tell you until you sign the contract  laura why not it sounds like a lot of money for something though  travis we have sympathy for your situation will you be here in a few hours if we need to return  matt oh i have no choice im in the process and she gestures to the papers below her and  theres a stack of approval letters and reports that 
none	 have to be put out there shes dividing what  forces that she can allow to go the eastern front and sticking her feet in the sand on what things  she needs to maintain order in the city  taliesin you have our deepest sympathies at your position this is obviously going to be a very  difficult time  matt well the issue here is that many of our finest investigators and hunters will be sent to  the east and as such many of the criminals and individuals that we were in the process of finding  
none	 and bringing to justice will now go free or return and run rampant  laura if only my friend were here me and my friend nott are really good at solving crimes  were the best investigators  matt well consider what im saying at the very least come back and notify me  laura okay  matt no harm no foul otherwise she leans forward and goes look i understand people are  as varied as they are selfish i believe in the empire but i definitely dont believe with all  the people that run it i do 
none	 what i do because i feel if i dont a lot of good people will be  crushed under the boot of those that misuse their power but there are good people here and we do  what we can ive seen the good that we can do thats why im here i wish to fight for this land  that i call home to protect those who cannot protect themselves and combat the destructiveness  and selfishness of anarchy utopias impossible i know that but i do what i can to make life as  livable as possible anyway 
none	 go speak with your friends and ill be here if you need me  laura do you think the war will make it all the way here  matt if the war makes it here then were in far more trouble than i anticipated  travis fair enough your asks are fair well return quickly  matt thank you i should get back to work she rubs her hands and gets back down to the paper  the door opens behind and voloshin leads you back out of the kings hall  laura if you ever need anyone to talk 
none	 to because you feel really stressed out im here im a good  healer mentally  matt she gives a nod and a wave  travis we turn and leave  matt you guys are escorted out of the kings hall and left back out to the streets  laura whoa that was crazy  ashley that was crazy  taliesin thats a lot  laura 10000 gold what do you think it is do you think its a dragon or something crazy like that  taliesin i think its the gentleman  travis i do too or something just 
none	 as sinister  ashley i wonder if theres any way to find out somehow what it is before accepting  laura i feel like the gentleman probably works with the city you guys  taliesin i feel like 10000 gold is buying an awful lot of cooperation more cooperation than i  think im capable of  travis lets find the others and get our story straight  laura back to the leaky tap then get our stuff together  travis and ashley yeah  taliesin then well meet them at the shop  matt as you guys get to 
none	 the leaky tap you see near the front door a young page wearing similar  though simpler robes as voloshin and members of the kings hall who approaches and goes oh hi  im sorry i was sent to give you this summons from the lawmaster  travis weve already been its all right  matt very well and then runs off you guys gather your supplies and start making your way  back towards the pentamarket the three of you where are you going  sam and liam the library  matt you make your way towards the archive 
none	 of the cobalt soul here in zadash the same beautiful  building with the large steepled tower top  marisha button up i turn to nott how do i look do i have any makeup running  sam do you wear makeup  marisha like once a week  sam i think its worn off  marisha all right good lets go  sam should i be  liam that would be helpful  sam do you think i should be more of a normie for this  liam im going to do the same thing that i did the 
none	 other day i am going to cast disguise self  and make the gigantic glasses and change my cloak to a similar shade of blue  marisha whats that thing you guys do mothers love whats that situation  sam thats for when we steal things and i pretend to be his baby and he pretends to be my  mama then when theyre looking at the cute baby he steals something  marisha right you could go with the first half of that plan but without the second half that  involves the stealing  liam they would let 
none	 you bring a mother and her baby into the library  sam ill be a dwarf  marisha im more concerned about bringing in a man and a goblin  sam i can disguise myself as well  liam normally when we do mothers love nott stabs people  marisha sure you do know how to adjust in certain circumstances though right you do know  how to improv based on the current surroundings though right  liam hey this citys under lockdown can we go into the library  marisha yeah lets go  sam ill cast disguise self 
dung	 and be a little halfling girl  matt as you guys make your way to the front archway of the entrance of the archive there is  the main signin bench which has the large tome thats on a small pedestal where you sign in to  enter the facility and then youre greeted by one of the archivists who approaches you recognize  this individual as madeer has olivecolored skin short dark hair approaches with a smile  beauregard you come with companions  marisha i do spreading that cobalt love  matt fantastic what is it you seek 
none	 this day  liam me i am interested in the history of the greatest arcanists of all time  matt history can be done arcanists can be done please do sign in here  liam ja caleb widogast  marisha thats your name  matt and your friend  sam veth  travis ham and beth  matt no surname very well i will be escorting you as well come madeer leads you into the  library for the first time you guys seeing it it is overwhelming its strange for as much as  theres a very calm almost 
none	 cathedrallike structure on the exterior the interior of the  chambers have a curved organic feel to the way its situated and organized the bookshelves wrap  around these walls these separate antechambers that are broken up like ventricles of a heart in  each one it is floor to 15foot ceiling filled books with large shifting ladders that glide  across poles and wheels there are a number of tables and small nooks where individuals are in  the process of taking notes or reading through its not super crowded theres maybe eight other  people in the facility 
none	 at this time obviously the city is very occupied with other things at the  moment its not like theres a huge constant need for this and the people in here are usually  regulars a lot of older folks people who tend to spend their later life wanting to read and learn  marisha memberships  matt you are led to a section madeer reads through arcanists you say historically are we  talking age of arcanum  liam i am looking for histories accounts of people who pushed the boundaries of what can be  done over the 
none	 ages the firsts i am interested in more than what is typical at least as much as can  be known do you follow me  matt i believe so  marisha hes a magic fan  liam ja that is true i am a magic fan  marisha little heavyhanded man like really heavyhanded  matt a few tomes are retrieved this here is a recollection of what elements of historical  significance could be pulled from the remnants of the age of arcanum precalamity there are a  great number of mages out there though many of them 
none	 befell darker interests but here are those  books if youre looking for more modern mages we have historical information on the past 200 years  of empirical magecraft and powerful wizards in that realm  liam what about the unexplained  matt explain what you mean by unexplained please  marisha i said you were already being too heavyhanded  liam questions there is a certain amount of knowledge in the schools of this empire and then  there are questions theorizing philosophy of the arcane  matt that would be more soltryce academy material they do lay claim 
none	 to most of those  theoretical discussions and research the cerberus assembly would be the keepers of those research  endeavors  liam excellent i shall go there next  matt i have a book here on the cerberus assembly if that would be of interest to you  liam yes  matt these tomes are presented to you you can spend time to read if youd like madeer watches  the entire time like a hawk  liam i start reading  matt which book do you go through first  liam i will start with the first the 
none	 oldest  matt okay are you absorbing it or are you skimming through  liam this one i am absorbing it i will read it cover to cover  matt cover to cover will take you the better part of the day  liam im a speed reader and an average novel takes an hour to an hour and a half for a speed  reader to read  matt youre a speed reader but this is also very dense material and it is essentially a historical  theorizing on historical elements theyve been able to piece together id say 
none	 by the time youve  gotten here itd be about noon in the day  liam im holding three tomes correct  matt yes and id say youd finish this book by about 300  liam if i take a moment to skim ten minutes through each one and get the barest idea of what  i would find inside each  matt you want me to just tell you all the history  liam no im trying to figure out if i were to look at a couple of pages at once from three  different books  matt 
none	 what are you looking for you have to give me something to go on here otherwise this is  going to turn into an hour and a half of me telling you about the history of the age of  arcanum  liam i want the furthest extent of transmutation and changing reality  matt okay there are discussions about transmutation on a powerful level it involves the  creation of turning mountains into mobile clouds it speaks of in the age of arcanum there were  floating cities there was arcane technology utilized in that period which was this 
none	 magical  utopia but a lot of that was lost in the war partially because a lot of these mages when they  had developed magic to this point werent satiated with their mortal capabilities and that  was when they were easily corruptible by the betrayer gods then it goes into discussion of the  calamity magics that can alter the fabric of reality exist out there some of them appear to be  myth some have been wiped from time and history because theyve been voted too dangerous and  theyre supposedly under lock and key in other 
none	 places of the world if not completely eradicated  because it was not fit to leave them in the hands of mortals  liam this was in one of these tomes  matt yes  liam then i will focus on that because im interested in that  matt it speaks on theories and manipulations of if youre looking for things realitybased  realitys a big scope transmutation specifically most of what you can glean from this discusses the  idea of turning from one creature to another turning from one substance to another how they  would be able 
none	 to build fortresses out of stone and then turn it to diamond for extra protective  elements and those were the great palaces of that age  liam you know my main interests do i find anything of that in here  matt you find some discussion of it you find some discussion of the manipulation of time but  what minor manipulation is capable through magic is merely to slow or expedite what happens  accelerating time to a certain degree becomes very dangerous and there is talk of some mages that  have attempted to reverse time in 
none	 short stints and that process is both very taxing and in the  past has completely annihilated those who toyed with that power it speaks specifically of two  different mages who believed that they could possibly alter choices alter elements of their  past to benefit their future their gaining of power and influence one was turned to dust the  other was never seen again  liam i spend all my time with that book  marisha hey madeer hows it been hows it going  matt it has been frustrating but fine  marisha fucking zeenoth am 
none	 i right  matt zeenoth is a great friend  marisha no hes a great friend great guy great guy that zeenoth has dairon left  matt i have not seen her this morning but i dont know if shes left or not  marisha cool cool  matt you read through that tome its about three in the afternoon now  marisha hey caleb not going to conquer the world in a library visit  liam can you give me two more hours  marisha no i cannot give you two more hours i cant i will gouge my 
none	 eyes out with a fucking  pencil if i give you two more hours  sam how about one more hour well all compromise  liam what about 30 more minutes  marisha do you have something in your neverending flask  sam of course would you like a drink are we allowed to drink in here why are you carrying  around a cup  liam i skim the book on the cerberus assembly  matt it has a breakdown of previous members who passed away its basically a historical dialogue  of how it was established the name 
none	 was actually a reference to a group that existed in the age of  arcanum it talks about how there was a war of mage houses 150 years ago within the empire that  nearly destroyed part of the capital rexxentrum and as part of the ceasefire and the arrest of  these mage houses that were at war as opposed to imprisoning them they agreed to bind themselves  to the empire and work for them thats what the cerberus assembly was established as a power  under rule of the king since then has flourished its helped the 
none	 kingdom rise to power it helped  them conquer the julous dominion they work with and under the king it talks of all the members  and it talks about what they do trent is in there there is master trent ikithon who is the  archmage of civil influence civil influence is the title and it talks about how he is the  propagandist and the constructor of the face of the empire in upperechelon circles it speaks of  martinet lunidus daleth who is the archmage of domestic protections who is the oldest in the  original member 
none	 of the assembly who still lives was there when it was built and is currently  considered the leader of the assembly it speaks of marquis jenna iresor who is the archmage of  industry one of the younger members of the assembly there is master doolan tversky who is  the archmage of dysology  liam and marisha dysology  matt dysology there is  sam are you reading these things out loud  laura yes he is  liam i could say im muttering it under my breath  matt there is lord athesias uludan who is the 
none	 archmage of diplomatic union there is lady vess  derogna who is the archmage of antiquity ill send you these later its fine ill send you an email  travis we now have something that rivals a shopping episode its called the library  matt there is headmaster zivan margolin who is the archmage of conscription then there is  headmaster oremid hass who is the archmage of cultivation those are the eight members  currently  travis i mean i have to give a small golf clap for  taliesin you wrote all this  marisha its the silmarillion 
none	  matt oh there is a lot more information  sam caleb when you were muttering there did you say dolan tversky  matt doolan  travis not dolan  liam similar name  marisha theres nothing in this you handed it back i thought there was going to be something in it  liam okay i will say that i got my fill i can feel this ones radiating  matt yeah burrowing vision into your neck  liam i want to stay for 17 more hours but im ready to go i am good i am done thank 
none	 you  marisha all right thank you  liam thank you  matt of course good day  marisha thanks madeer  matt good to see you beauregard he escorts you out of the archive  liam caleb looks at the thousands of books that he did not read and leaves  matt yeah and theres a whole second level above the spiral staircase  laura and we count our fucking blessings  marisha you know youre not going to find any answers in any of those books  liam lets go find the others  laura weve already left 
none	 the city  travis we are in rexxentrum  sam theyre in a different campaign  marisha what do you mean its been 17 years pumat what do you mean  matt you guys what have you been up to during this time because its been a number of hours  laura anything  travis we ate like three shepherds pies we fucking killed a guy and hid him in the room we  stuck him next to the skellington  laura it was great  taliesin we did our taxes  laura molly told all of our fortunes  
town	 taliesin yeah  matt youve gathered all your materials you went and checked on your cart which is now  currently  laura we just pushed the giant rotting head out of it and left it on the street  matt okay that is a nasty fucking manticore head the flesh has sloughed off of it at this  point yeah its pretty rough you have your cart the horses are still there the horses you  had at least  laura hey you guys i never used my fate thingy yesterday because im stupid did you guys want to 
none	  use it today  travis for what  laura oh did i not tell you about this thing oh my gosh you guys you know the weird little thing  that we stole  travis uhhuh  laura well it gives you this okay so you focus on it and you go to this place and you can  see it and theres this little gray ball and it goes touch me and then you go okay then it  comes out and it goes in your chest and you get control of your fate for one time in 
none	 a day  travis wow  ashley what what do you mean you get control of your fate  laura well like basically like if you fuck up or something like that then you get to fix it maybe  ashley can you go back and  laura no its like all of a sudden you feel a little lucky maybe  ashley do you want to try it  travis yeah sure why not  laura lets hide next to the body that we just killed so that you can try it in the cellar so  that nobody 
none	 sees because we should probably be careful pulling this thing out  taliesin i would imagine right now especially  laura yeah i pull out the box just focus on it fjord ill protect you  travis do i have to touch it or just look at it  laura i cant remember i think you just  travis ill do both are you doing it too  ashley im going in  laura it can only do one person in a day but well pass it around the group so if you want  it today fjord then yasha 
none	 you can do it tomorrow  ashley okay  travis sure  matt as you focus on it theres nothing really there until your hand touches it and then theres  a momentary connection you feel the thrumming of the object this dull heartbeat your vision goes  tunneled until youre pulled into this space of light and stars distant gases and colors there  you see beyond this brief journey this sense of self dissipating at the moment where it gets a  little scary and you being to lose a sense of personal identity you see this tiny 
none	 gray mote of  energy before you thats also pulsing with that same pattern you instinctively reach out and feel  as you absorb it into yourself and there the fragment of  laura did he say anything when he touched it like caleb did  matt did you say anything  laura did you say anything no you were silent the whole time  matt your vision has come back to you and you feel this  sam im half sea monster  travis was i supposed to say something  laura no its just when caleb did it 
none	 he was like i love you mom and dad then he started  crying  travis oh no it was a crazy trip though  laura yeah  travis yep  ashley do you feel like you have control over your fate  travis no  taliesin do you feellucky  travis and taliesin do you  travis well i dont know  laura i close up the box i put it back in the bag  taliesin lets go to pumats and lets get the rest of them together im sure by now  laura we will ride the 
town	 cart do you guys really think we probably shouldnt become legionnaires then  taliesin no  laura no we should leave town  taliesin i think we should get out of town while the gettings good  laura that ladys really nice though shes like a grandma  travis 10000 gold i mean shit wouldnt mind earning 10000 and then bouncing  sam were going to go to pumats as well  taliesin youre conscripted once you start earning that 10000  travis yeah youre conscripted as long as you stay in town  laura i wonder how the contract 
none	 works i bet its like a magical contract or something like that  where you sign it and then they have like your soul  taliesin or you sign it and then the next time you come across some soldiers of the empire they  have you executed for treason for running off on it  laura oh that would be bad  ashley yeah we should explore this idea but maybe  travis right lets go to pumats  matt well say for the purposes of expediency and you guys lolling around a little bit to try  and 
none	 catch up you all arrive at pumat sols in roughly the same time in the pentamarket as you  enter the interior of the chamber you can see the three pumats are dusting and staring off because  there are currently no other people making purchases inside most of the business and chaos  people dealing with the initial shock and preparation stage of this coming scuffle with the  east as you enter the first pumat glances over in your direction oh hello there its real  interesting morning times what can i do for you  travis had 
none	 a bit of a tussle guess what were back for  laura i bet he doesnt have any more yet  sam healing potions do you have any  matt unfortunately you guys have pretty much cleaned me out and what little bits i had were  snatched up bright and early this morning by the righteous brand  laura we should have bought some earlier do you know of anyone else that would have some  matt generally i dont like to plug rival purveyors here in the city  laura right but seeing as how you dont have 
none	 any inventory  matt there is grace of the wilds which is on the southern side of the pentamarket you can go ahead  and have jasna bree maybe help you there if the army hasnt gotten to her first but i digress  respectfully its going to be real difficult this time of year  laura to get healing potions  matt because were at war  laura this time of year like it happens every year  matt no but i mean its that time of year right now apparently where war happens thats a  problem  
none	 laura are you going to go to war pumat  matt laughs no  laura but youre such a powerful person dont you think you would be helpful  matt i dont think thats any of our fates right now isnt that right boys theyre all like  yeah no thats no warfares not my thing  travis i know we were in here very recently you havent got any overnight special deliveries of  anything interesting have you  matt unfortunately youve taken the bulk of what was there other than a few odds  and ends that you 
none	 couldnt afford previously  liam do you have any of that paper that i have been purchasing so much of  matt we got a little more paper yeah  liam could i purchase say 200 gold worth of it  matt certainly that can be provided we still have that little pearl thing we got the  bracelets but thats all we got at the moment mister prime back there is hard at work he turns  back and you hear this voice like yeah got a lot of stock to kick up now you cleared me out for 
none	 a  while which thanks for that  travis youre welcome  laura what was the pearl again  matt oh this heres a pearl that allows you to go ahead and utilize your magical capabilities  lets see here yeah you use a command word and it allows you to regain one of your spells  sam how much was it  matt this one runs you roughly about 350 gold pieces  laura i would like to buy that please thank you  matt all righty by all means  sam is it one use only and then 
none	 its gone forever  matt once per day  travis what was that other item you had  matt well here you are if you would like to  laura is it the pearl of power  matt it is  laura i had that as vex  matt theres this enchanted shield here which we discussed previously that has an enchantment  to its deflection capabilities so it will help improve your chances of avoiding dangerous  physical contact via weaponry and other sources then these here are this pair of bracers are able  to do a similar 
none	 scenario given you dont have too many types of hide or metal in the way to prevent  the enchantment from protecting you but  travis does it work with medium armor  matt well nah it only works if you dont have any armor or shield  ashley oh what does it do  sam no armor not even light armor  matt yeah sorry  laura do you wear armor yasha  ashley no  taliesin oh  liam beauregard does not either  sam how much are those  matt that one will run you back about 
none	 1200 gold  sam maybe not forget that  taliesin i dont know  ashley well come back for another day  sam do you have any enchanted crossbow bolts  matt let me go ahead and check there for a second those are generally smallerscale here  pumat iii if you dont mind i got it already listening to you dont worry he goes up a small  ladder in the far corner into an attic place and you hear some rustling around as the other pumats  are there patiently watching so yeah crazy war times huh  
none	 travis how much for that shield  matt oh this here enchanted shield will run you about 550 gold pieces  travis i think im all right  matt fair enough about five minutes pass and then the pumat comes down hes got a small bound  cluster of bolts and he goes hey so its all we got but weve got a batch here of ten enchanted  crossbow bolts these upon firing should offer a small batch of fiery impact on whatever you strike  with them  sam how much are they  matt for each of 
town	 these its 50 gold per bolt  sam ill take two bolts please  matt two bolts here you go  sam thank you  matt he passes them over to you these bolts upon impact do an additional 1d8 fire damage  sam nice  matt you have two of them and its one use only  sam okay 1d8 fire damage great  matt you may have a chance of recovering them depending  sam okay cool what did we decide are we leaving town or are we doing something else  travis we got an offer to 
none	 work for the city to be legionnaires to protect it while its troops  hunters and mercenaries are going to the front lines there are bounties of up to 10000 gold in  reward if we stay  sam caleb do we want to stay are there things here that you need  liam i defer to the group i think we work well together and whatever you thinks best  marisha 10000 gold  ashley 10000 gold is a lot of money  marisha they want someone really important dead is what it sounds like to me  ashley 
none	 yeah  taliesin sounds like an expensive enemy to make  travis our other option being fleeing the city there were no postings for  laura we already pushed the nasty head out of our wagon  marisha oh should have done that like a week ago good call yeah  taliesin im legitimately happy to go in any direction far away from the front line  personally  marisha is joining the city joining the war is that what they made it sound like  travis believe so  taliesin i think its a slippery slope  laura joining 
none	 the city is protecting the city more than it is joining the war  taliesin its conscription  marisha the citys a part of the empire  laura but youre under contract for 15 gold a week  liam what about your interests in the hall of erudition here and the academy  travis oh the soltryce  liam yeah  travis yeah id like to see it but i guess im not in a terrible rush  laura the big ones in rexxentrum anyway  marisha i think well make gold wherever we go  taliesin i agree they 
none	 say theres kids disappearing up north  laura if we stop by the merchants guild we may still be able to be armored escorts for people  sam or we could just leave  laura or we could just go  marisha check by the merchants guild see our options and then make the decision from there  travis sure  marisha all right  liam you know coasting is not a bad idea either there is not as massive a gain but there is not  as high a risk for whatever this 10000 gold  target is  
none	 laura yeah lets not do that one  liam play it safe  laura just be armored guards  marisha this means were staying together though  laura oh i thought yes that was a given right i mean we all work so well together  taliesin i like it  laura we make really good roommates  marisha we do make such good roommates  sam well beau do you want us to stay together  marisha i think we make a good team i think theres more to be had here  sam all right  marisha it 
none	 might run out who knows im not an optimist but think theres still more to be had  taliesin do we make a polite exit at the least or do we just bugger out  travis she seemed pretty heartfelt i think a polite exit would be thoughtful  taliesin im fair for that  marisha merchants guild then polite exit  sam yeah maybe well rustle up wc loo john crapper shitter and toilet  marisha oh thats right our horsies  laura and marisha yeah  matt any other business you want to do before you decide to 
none	 leave the city  laura did you want to swing by and see if yeah can we pop into the other shop the old grace of  the wild and see if they have any healing potions just to check out  matt okay yeah  taliesin just in case  sam in the interest of time  laura yeah  sam do they have any  matt in the interest of time jasna bree who is a rather eccentric woman with wild black hair a  slightly hard to follow disposition greets you and is like hi welcome glad 
none	 you could make it  healing potions yes unfortunately kind of already cleared out im so sorry give me a week  i will have a fresh batch of healing potions and id be happy to help  laura definitely be back in a week wait do you have any herbalism kits  matt i do i do  laura oh great could i buy some  matt i have four  sam how much  matt for each its let me check she goes into her ledger  taliesin the dms guide  matt yeah it works out well 
none	  laura would i be able to make potions of healing with this  matt with herbalism kits  laura yeah  matt i believe you would yes  laura okay  sam you can make potions of healing  matt correct it is five gold per  laura oh great how many do you have  matt you have to have proficiency with it to make a potion of healing are you proficient with  herbalism kit  laura i dont know how i would tell  matt it would be under your proficiencies  laura oh then no 
none	 oh no i only have proficiency with a forgery kit and a disguise kit  matt sorry  laura no then fuck it i dont want that shit  travis im going to go back to pumats im going to buy that damn shield  matt okay there you go  travis thank you  sam if she has the materials to make acid ill buy it from her  matt yeah she easily has materials and sells them to you  taliesin i couldnt make potions with alchemist supplies could i  matt not potions you can make poisons 
none	 acid various alchemical concepts but thats the gist of it  taliesin all right  marisha does she have any badass weapons any badass sticks  matt no she is purely a purveyor of salves and natural remedies and  liam ointments  matt yeah  laura can i ask a question  matt yes  laura with a healers kit can you heal people when youre not in combat or is it just for  stabilizing  matt the healers kit usually can be used to stabilize somebody theres a feat you can take  that allows you to 
none	 spend an action to heal someone with it in combat its called the healer feat  which is actually pretty cool  laura oh okay ill look at that  matt it turns anybody into a combat healer  laura okay  sam should we go say goodbye to somebody and leave  marisha are we checking the merchants to see if theres any armed escort requests out of the  merchants guild  matt whos helming that  sam fjord  travis not me  laura ill do it  matt make an investigation check  sam im coming 
none	 with her  ashley ill help you  laura us three oh that was bad  matt shes helping you with it its advantage on you  laura yes laughs oh no slightly better five  matt you gather the knowledge of this war has blindsided most of the merchant guilds in zadash  best you can tell most of them are in the process of getting ready to figure out what their next  endeavor is those that would be leaving wont be leaving for a few days if you hang around you  may be able to pick 
none	 up that kind of work  ashley okay thats something  laura well i think wed have to wait maybe we should just go  ashley should we say our goodbyes to orentha  laura well swing by and say sorry we are declining  matt as you guys make your way back to the kings hall you are escorted back into orentha  stonegrasps office i see youve returned i appreciate your expediency in getting back to me  her crackling southern drawl breaking through with her bright dwarven smile considering what weve  discussed what have you come 
none	 to a conclusion on  laura i think we are probably not going to be able to help out right now  matt i understand  sam its not you its us were not ready for that kind of commitment  matt i understand thats all right  sam youre going to make an adventuring party very happy some day  laura you really will  matt i hope so well send someone else after the hawker  laura after the what  matt the hawker  laura whats a hawker  matt dont worry about it  sam does 
none	 anyone know what a hawker is  liam which spelling are you using for that word awk ock  matt hawk  laura like a monster or something  matt no he actually was a legionnaire for us about five years back but then went rogue and we  believe had ties with the myriad and became a powerful tentpole here in the marrow valley we  had him cornered in deastok about three months ago by a team of crownsguard under the leadership of  carlos ventuga but this hawker slew carlos and fled south into the wuyun gorge 
none	 and disappeared  into the menagerie coast were having to send whoever we can to try and retrieve him and bring him  back alive  laura from the menagerie coast  matt yes  travis the opposite direction  laura the menagerie coast is really freaking cool you guys  sam so many choices  laura oh shit that sounds really cool  matt if you need more time thats fine  laura what do you guys think hold on can we talk about this  taliesin quick huddle  sam pros and cons  taliesin im happy just 
none	 to leave the city  laura pros we get to visit the menagerie coast which is always really cool  travis pro 10000 gold  laura do we have a time limit on when wed be able to get him  matt no but the longer it takes the easier he probably has vanishing into the south  laura makes sense  matt we sent a troupe after him about eight weeks ago and i fear they may not be coming back  at this point we intended to send some of our top investigators from the capital after this 
none	  bounty  sam investigators  laura thats what they said  sam thats our job  laura were really good at it  matt its 10000 gold alive 5000 dead  laura what if we were like lets go after this guy and then after that well talk about being  under contract like this can be a test situation  matt unfortunately if this is to happen i need you under contract  sam do you need some tea or something  matt im good i appreciate your conscientiousness  sam a lozenge  matt im all right 
none	 but thank you  taliesin do you have a lozenge  sam i dont i just feel bad for her  taliesin shouldnt be offering things that you dont have  matt its fine  ashley what does the contract entail  matt retrieving this man and bringing him back here for justice  ashley how long are we in contract with you just for this or  matt the contract has you as a legionnaire and as part of that you just  sam forever  matt well until we decide to mutually end your service  marisha mutually 
none	  matt well if you wish out of it we can discuss it its fine but i mean as opposed to deserting  is the problem  marisha so you want to hire more legionnaires to go kill an exlegionnaire who wasnt legionnairey  enough for you  laura no he ran away when he was a legionnaire  matt he ran away and then allied himself we believe with the myriad and then has since upon  attempting to bring him in murdered some of our finest men  marisha right  laura the myriad does some scary stuff 
none	 you guys  taliesin if we happen to bring him in even if we werent under contract  matt part of the bounty would still apply im sure  laura how much of the bounty  matt probably half  ashley thats an option  laura but if we were part of the contract then we would get access to a bunch of stuff  ashley thats true  matt think about it  sam think about it  laura can we decide can we talk about this  sam huddle up again  matt you guys can discuss this 
none	 over the next week if you want you dont need to decide this right now  taliesin im too tired to make proper decisions  matt its fine return when you have an idea youre led outside and start making your way to  the leaky tap to discuss your plan of action there waiting  laura this is where we hit the save point i dont know  matt as you guys head back to the leaky tap the righteous brand are making their way through the  city its a weirdly solemn unexpected military parade essentially as theyre 
none	 just gathering  supplies and making their way through its a show of strength to help rise the spirits of people  that seem confused and worried about this coming conflict so it does seem to calm nerves and a lot  of the children seem excited to see them coming down the streets on their horses and their  armaments on display while youre watching it go by a voice whispers up next to you and goes  psst hey you turn and you see hood up kara sorry dont mean to bother you if you have a  
town	 moment things are getting strange around here and the gentleman may have a bit of work for you  groaning  marisa were the prettiest girl in town  taliesin should have left in the middle of the goddamn night  matt well pick up from there next week you guys made quite a display last night in the victory pit  liam you just made it three times as complicated in seven seconds  matt yeah i know  taliesin knew it was coming  matt picking up on that however you guys do level up you hit level

none	 you can use your reaction to halve the attacks damage against you  matt yep  sam holy shit im unstoppable  matt thats part of the reason that vax survived so much in the last campaign  laura i think i get revivify now  sam can i use that once a day once a round  matt no its just your reaction once a round  sam once a round  matt yeah  sam holy shit im a golden god  taliesin i get a new blood curse i want to have a conversation about that before
